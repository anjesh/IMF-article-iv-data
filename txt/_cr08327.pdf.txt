Executive Summary
Background: The economy has been exhibiting robust growth, but imbalances have
emerged: the current account deficit has widened and underlying inflation has picked
up. Procyclical fiscal policy has added to these imbalances. Moreover, large public
sector wage increases threaten to spill over to private sector settlements, thus
exacerbating inflation pressures and weighing on competitiveness. Credit growth has
started to slow down and tightened financial conditions have resulted in a fall in bank
profitability. Looking ahead, the signing of the Stabilization and Association
Agreement (SAA) with the EU and progress in fiscal coordination could provide
impetus for much-needed structural reforms.
Staff views: The main challenge is to tighten fiscal and public sector wage policies.
Moreover, fiscal policies should be more coordinated and anchored within a mediumterm framework, and aim at reducing the size of the government and raising its
efficiency. It is also important to further strengthen banking supervision and contain
risks to financial stability. These policies should provide a solid basis for the stability
of the currency board arrangement.
Authorities’ views: The authorities broadly agreed with the staff’s diagnosis and
recommendations. On account of the SAA signing, they felt optimistic about their
country’s prospects and reform momentum, and hoped that recent progress in fiscal
coordination would keep public finances on a strong footing.

I. OVERVIEW
1.
The economy has been exhibiting robust growth, but macroeconomic
imbalances have emerged. Benefiting from the currency board and the effects of past
reforms in key sectors and the financial system, Bosnia & Herzegovina (BiH) has seen strong
growth and low inflation in recent years. However, with capital inflows driving a domesticdemand boom, economic tensions have built up. The current account deficit has widened,
and, while inflation accelerated mainly on account of global food and energy price shocks,
underlying inflation pressures have also intensified. Procyclical fiscal policy has added to
these imbalances. Unsettled global financial markets and a worsening economic environment
in Europe pose risks to BiH’s stability and growth prospects.
2.
Progress vis-à-vis the EU is encouraging, but the complex political system
complicates policymaking. The SAA opens the road to EU accession and could help
accelerate reforms. Also, the approval of the Fiscal Council law and agreement on a
permanent indirect tax revenue allocation formula should help improve fiscal coordination.
The Dayton Peace Agreement created two largely-autonomous entities, Republika Srpska
(RS) and the Croat-Bosniak Federation of BiH (Federation) divided into ten largely-ethnic
cantons, all held together by a central government (State) with a limited mandate. This
structure causes duplication of many domestic policy functions and weakens incentives for
cooperation. Moreover, policies are diverging between the two Entities, with the RS making
steady progress on reforms and the Federation finding it difficult to mobilize action on
needed reforms. Preparing BiH for eventual EU accession will require constitutional reform:
a modest first attempt failed in 2006, and the conflicting views on the future makeup of the
country suggest still little common ground.
II. BACKGROUND
3.
Despite robust economic performance in recent years, convergence to EU
income levels has been slow. Considering its late start to transition and the devastating
effects of the 1992–95 war, BiH’s current level of per capita income—which is above the
Balkan average—is remarkable (Figure 1). Although real GDP increased by a cumulative
30 percent since 2002, BiH’s growth dynamics put it somewhat below the convergence path
traced by other countries at a similar point in transition.1

The economy is experiencing an absorption boom, but capacity constraints are
emerging. Solid output growth continued in 2007 supported by strong productivity gains,
especially in the tradable sector. However, domestic demand—with broadly equivalent
contributions from consumption and investment—took over as an engine of growth
(Figure 2). It has been supported by robust real credit growth (22 percent), healthy wage
increases (10 percent), and a
sizeable fiscal impulse (1.2 percent

of GDP). In 2008, leading

countries. Moreover, wage and
price pressures have been on the
rise, with excess demand spilling over into a larger trade deficit. Although it is difficult to
gauge the size of the output gap in a transition economy like BiH, staff estimates suggest that
it has been narrowing (Figure 2)2.

The current account deficit is widening, but official reserves rose in 2007 as the
balance of payments benefited from large long-term inflows. The absorption boom was
mirrored by a widening external deficit, which reached 13 percent of GDP in 2007—an
underlying deterioration of 1.5 percentage points of GDP.3 Export growth moderated to
15 percent (driven by strong volume growth), after a torrid pace in the preceding years, and
imports resumed their faster growth following a temporary, VAT-related slowdown in 2006.
The current account deficit was fully covered by FDI, largely reflecting privatizations in the
RS, which together with bank borrowing and other unidentified inflows pushed gross official
reserves to €3.4 billion (5.4 months of imports) at end-2007. Data for early-2008 point to a

further widening of the external deficit, with still-robust export growth overshadowed by
strong import growth, and higher food and energy prices contributing more than half of the
increase in the import-to-GDP ratio.
6.
The real effective exchange rate has been stable and external competitiveness
appears adequate. Staff calculations using various methodologies imply that the equilibrium
current account deficit ranges between 7½–13½ percent of GDP, although a number of
factors (e.g., underestimation of current inflows) merit consideration in making an
assessment (Box 1). With the caveat of large uncertainties surrounding the estimates, the
current account deficit has been moving toward unsustainable levels. At the same time, the
real effective exchange rate has been stable, and, although some margin of overvaluation can
not be ruled out, at present levels, does not raise significant external stability concerns.
Indicators of price and cost competitiveness vis-à-vis neighboring countries remain benign,
export growth has been strong, and export market share has steadily increased, amid robust
productivity gains in the tradable sector (Figure 4). Finally, financing of the current account
deficits remains tilted toward more stable sources—FDI and long-term bank-mediated
inflows—and the external position does not indicate serious vulnerability risks (Figure 5).
3

See Chapter III “Assessing BiH’s External Stability and Competitiveness” of the IMF Country Report for the
Selected Issues for the 2008 Article IV consultation, released along with this document.

10
Box 1. External Competitiveness
Staff analysis suggests that, while the external deficit currently exceeds sustainable levels, there is no
strong evidence of a significantly overvalued real exchange rate (RER) at present that could result in
future external instability. However, large uncertainties surround this assessment.
Equilibrium current account deficit (CAD) estimates are between 7½ –13½ percent of GDP.
•

•
•

The CGER macroeconomic balance approach suggests an equilibrium CAD—taking into account
about 2 percent of GDP capital transfers—of 9 percent of GDP. However, this may underestimate it
in a setting of EU convergence and rapid financial integration. Accounting for these effects (IMF
WP/07/64), the equilibrium CAD is 13½ percent, thus implying no gap from the underlying deficit.
The external sustainability approach suggests that the CAD level required to stabilize net foreign
liabilities (NFL) is 7½ percent, implying a 6 percent gap.
The CGER equilibrium RER approach suggests a RER undervaluation of 17 percent. This result is
driven mainly by a favorable productivity differential against trading partners.

•

The consistently-large and positive errors and omissions (2 percent of GDP)—which may reflect
underestimation of current inflows (Country Report 06/368)—also merit consideration in
interpreting the above CAD gaps.

Export and productivity trends suggest that competitiveness is adequate.
•

•

Export growth has been robust and export market share steadily increased. Constant-market-share
analysis suggests that BiH’s export growth over 2003–06 can be mainly explained by the
competitiveness effect. Recent data point to continued robust export growth in 2007–08
(15 percent), with import growth mainly driven by imports of machinery and base metals (29 and
43 percent, respectively).
Relative to nontradables, average labor productivity growth of BiH tradables over 2004–06 was
much higher than that of the main trading partners.

Accelerating inflation raises concerns. Headline inflation increased to 8.2 percent
y-o-y in May, reflecting mainly food and energy price shocks (Figure 6). However,
underlying inflation has also picked up, and producer price inflation has remained high
(6.7 percent) suggesting that price setters, faced with higher input costs, are trying to
maintain their markups. The authorities have resisted calls for reducing the VAT on food
and, with the deregulated petroleum market, the pass-through of international to domestic
prices has been instantaneous. To alleviate somewhat the impact of inflation on the poor, RS
authorities increased targeted transfers, while both entities raised agricultural subsidies. The
recent rise in inflation has been partially contained by the spillover of demand pressures into
higher imports, and BiH’s inflation performance compares favorably with that of its peers
(Figure 6).
8.
Fiscal policy has become procyclical. The general government registered a deficit
of 0.1 percent of GDP in 2007, compared with a 2.2 percent surplus in 2006, adding further
stimulus to an already-strong domestic

threaten its fiscal position.

Although public debt is currently low, there are uncertainties about the size of
the government’s contingent liabilities. At end-2007, gross public debt stood at 31 percent
of GDP and general government deposits amounted to 15 percent of GDP. This favorable
picture is clouded by: (i) the constitutional controversy over the issuance of bonds to cover
frozen foreign-currency deposit (FFCD) obligations, which risks reopening court challenges
to the size of the compensation;4 (ii) uncertainty regarding the ultimate size of restitution
claims and settlement terms; and (iii) the unknown size of government contingent liabilities
to cover debts of loss-making state-owned enterprises.

Following the bond issuance by the RS, the CBBH withdrew its services as fiscal agent for issuance of FFCD
bonds by the State on behalf of the Federation.

Real Growth of Credit to Private Sector
(Annual percent change 2003–07)

10.
Financial deepening accelerated in 2007, but remains in line with regional
trends. Benefiting from a low interest rate environment (Figure 7), robust credit growth
brought the credit-to-GDP ratio to 56 percent in 2007. Concerns about the speed of credit
expansion prompted the Central Bank of Bosnia and Herzegovina (CBBH) to increase
reserve requirements at

(Percent of GDP)
(Figure 8). Banks’ open
positions are limited but the large volume of FX-linked lending raises the possibility of
currency mismatches in household and corporate sectors.5 Despite several measures taken in
2007 (Table 11), banking supervision remains hampered by fragmentation into two Entitybased agencies and limited cooperation with foreign banking supervisors.
11.
Financial conditions have tightened somewhat in 2008. Lending interest rates have
so far remained flat, but commercial banks mentioned early indications that global financial
tensions are affecting foreign funding. While bank soundness indicators are favorable, bank
profitability declined in Q1 of 2008 (Table 10). With a widening external deficit and a
slowdown in capital inflows, M2 growth slowed to 16 percent (y-o-y in May), against
22 percent at end-2007. Real private sector credit growth moderated to 20 percent (y-o-y in
May) from 22 percent at end-2007, led by a deceleration of household credit growth.
12.
A breakthrough has been made on fiscal structural reforms. The long-awaited
approval of the Fiscal Council law and agreement on a permanent indirect revenue-allocation
formula should improve fiscal coordination. Moreover, income tax reforms in the RS and the
Federation represent a welcome step toward greater harmonization. Also, public wage
reforms in the State and the RS have sought to simplify the wage structure and consolidate
some allowances with wages. However, little progress has been made on the reform of public
administration and the social benefit system.

Bank lending and deposit data suggest that the household sector FX position is broadly balanced. The
corporate sector’s position is less clear because of limited data availability.

III. POLICY DISCUSSIONS
14.
The Article IV discussions took place amid renewed optimism about BiH’s
prospects, notwithstanding a complicated policy environment. The SAA could renew the
reform momentum, but the complex political structure may weaken the focus on reform. RS
has emerged as a faster reformer owing to greater political cohesion and societal consensus,
but the Federation finds it difficult to mobilize action on reforms. The discussions took place
against a backdrop of concerns about inflation and the challenge of managing fiscal pressures
in the face of rising public expectations, and focused on: (i) policies best suited to reduce
vulnerabilities and promote sustainable strong growth; and (ii) the main risks to financial
stability and ways to mitigate them. Table 12 summarizes the authorities’ responses to past
Fund recommendations.
A. Outlook
15.
In the short run, economic growth is set to remain strong. For 2008, the fiscal
stimulus of 1.8 percentage points of GDP and a loose public-sector wage policy suggest that
domestic demand pressures are unlikely to diminish. The strong momentum is projected to
keep GDP growth at 5½ percent in 2008, but emerging capacity constraints and a slightly
lower fiscal stimulus will drive a slowdown in growth to 5 percent in 2009. Headline
inflation is to average 7½ percent in 2008, with underlying inflation at around 3 percent.
Buoyant domestic demand along with a projected terms-of-trade deterioration will push the
current account deficit to 16 percent of GDP, with FDI covering about one-third.

While there are upside risks to the baseline, the balance of risks is tilted
somewhat to the downside. Although for now there are no signs of slowing economic
activity, higher bank funding costs could soon lead to a scaling back of lending. More
pronounced spillovers from the deteriorating external environment could undermine growth
and external stability. With higher price and wage inflation, external competitiveness would
deteriorate, and the risk of a disruptive adjustment rise. On the upside, sustained high metal
prices, lower oil prices, higher grants or stronger FDI could lift economic performance.
17.
Under current policies, unattended vulnerabilities will hamper BiH’s mediumterm growth prospects. Growth-accounting analysis suggests that—with investment and
total factor productivity growing at historical averages, and a pickup in labor force growth—

output growth would moderate over the medium term. In the baseline scenario, slow progress
on structural reforms would limit productivity gains and export growth prospects. With
broadly unchanged fiscal policy, the large public sector would narrow the space for private
sector investment and growth. Domestic demand growth would slow down somewhat as

22

private sector credit growth would
decelerate. With the projected terms-oftrade deterioration6, the current account
deficit would remain at about 15 percent of
GDP in 2010-11, before leveling off at
around 13–14 percent by 2013—at the
high-end of the sustainable range
(Figure 11). While public debt would hover
at 40 percent of GDP, any further fiscal
deterioration would put it on an
unsustainable path.

The authorities took a more sanguine view regarding BiH’s medium-term
prospects. Their framework is predicated on strong output growth (5–6 percent per year) and
low inflation (2 percent). They shared the baseline external outlook, but emphasized upside
risks stemming from FDI and continued strong inflows from banks and other sources. Staff
acknowledged that with the right policy mix—fiscal policy crowding in the private sector by
targeting a balance over the medium term and ambitious reforms supporting productivity
gains—potential output would be boosted and the external deficit be reduced to sustainable
levels (Table 9b and Figure 11).
B. Public Finances
19.
Fiscal policy is key for ensuring macroeconomic stability. The widening current
account deficit, the associated external stability risks, and unabated inflationary pressures call
for fiscal policy to avoid a recurrence of last year’s procyclical easing. This, together with
prudent public-sector wage policy, should help stabilize the economy. The authorities agreed
that fiscal policy was the only macroeconomic-management tool to ensure the stability of the
currency board and reiterated their commitment to such arrangement until euro adoption—
their exit strategy.
20.
Staff thus argued that a general government balance was an appropriate
medium-term target. First, with the external stability assessment suggesting that the current
account deficit has been hovering at unsustainable levels, a balanced-budget target would
contribute to macroeconomic stability, by helping narrow the S–I gap and gradually bringing
the external deficit to sustainable levels. Second, it would ensure fiscal sustainability—by
contributing to a reduction in the debt-to-GDP ratio to below 30 percent ahead of the lapsing

of concessionality of government debt7 and minimizing risks from the uncertain burden of
unsettled claims against the government.8 Third, it would be a simple and transparent
anchor for policymakers and the public—an important consideration in BiH. While broadly
agreeing with these observations, no authority was in a position to articulate clear mediumterm fiscal policy objectives for BiH as a whole.
21.
The mission cautioned against fiscal stimulus in 2008. The adopted budgets
envisage an overall deficit of 3 percent of GDP, implying a significant fiscal relaxation. This
would exacerbate already-strong domestic demand pressures and contribute to a widening
current account deficit. Mounting commitments for transfers to households in the Federation,

strong efforts to avoid fiscal stimulus.
While acknowledging that this might not be feasible at this stage, it urged the authorities to
reduce the fiscal impulse in 2008 relative to the budget and target a balance in 2009 (see
below). In this vein, a deficit of up to 1 percent of GDP in 2008 would provide a realistic and
credible target toward medium-term balance. This would require: (i) the RS saving as much
as possible of its revenue overperformance; (ii) in the absence of legislative changes, the
Federation cutting other spending to accommodate war-related benefits; and (iii) the lower
levels of government rationalizing spending.
22.
The authorities considered a fiscal tightening unduly restrictive. They viewed
BiH’s low debt, and abundant privatization proceeds (in the RS) and foreign financing as
providing fiscal space to boost much-needed infrastructure and support growth. They also
argued that a small deficit would pose little risk to fiscal sustainability. Federation officials
also found it difficult to tighten fiscal policy in 2008, due to limited prospects of resisting

social-transfer pressures in the runup to the October local elections. In this context, they
voiced their frustration about the parliamentary practice of approving legislation that creates
unfunded spending commitments.
23.
The 2009 budget would provide an opportunity for a new fiscal policy approach.
It should support macroeconomic stability by targeting a balance and incorporate reforms to
improve the quality of spending. 9 The authorities were confident that the Fiscal Council and
the permanent indirect tax revenue allocation formula open the road for a more coordinated
and predictable fiscal policy. It is thus important to make the Council operational as soon as
possible by involving it in the design of the 2009 budget and medium-term fiscal targets.
Improving fiscal reporting, including by harmonizing accounting standards and budget
calendars for all governments, will be critical for the Council’s effectiveness. There is also a
need to overhaul budgetary procedures in the Federation to ensure new legislation is funded,
strengthen cash-management practices to avoid future liquidity problems, and reform the
system of transfers to households.
24.
Privatization proceeds should be used to support BiH’s growth objectives
without compromising macroeconomic stability. The RS authorities are committed to use
most of the funds for infrastructure and pension reform. In the Federation, plans have been
drawn up to use most of the proceeds for investment, but due to unfunded social-transfer
commitments, there is a risk that a large part could be used for recurrent spending. The
mission expressed concerns about the effectiveness of subsidized lending through
development banks, and encouraged the authorities to engage in a systematic evaluation of
alternative uses of privatization proceeds (including a reduction in contingent liabilities
related to public-enterprise debts, or financing of the transitional pension-reform cost).
Finally, while private sector involvement in infrastructure is welcome, a strong institutional
framework for public-private partnerships is necessary.
25.
A strict public-sector wage policy is critical for containing demand pressures.
The public wage reforms in the State and the RS are welcome, but recent large public-sector
wage increases draw attention to BiH’s large government payroll and the relatively high level
of public wages compared with the rest of the economy (Figure 12). Also, the step
adjustment in RS public-sector wages was particularly steep, although the RS government is
committed to improve efficiency and freeze wages for the next three years. The State wage
indexation mechanism (and similar mechanisms in the Federation and lower levels of
government) could lead to substantial further increases in the wage bill; but the State
authorities committed to avoiding destabilizing wage increases by invoking a special clause
in the state wage law. As for the risk that public-sector wage competition could spill over to
private-sector settlements, the authorities were confident that market discipline would ensure
that private-sector settlements continue to be competitive.

The proposals in the World Bank’s 2006 Public Expenditure Review remain pertinent.

C. Financial Sector Issues
26.
Financial sector surveillance needs to be intensified and preemptive measures be
considered. Higher inflation and input costs are beginning to put pressure on the budgets of
households and enterprises, raising concerns about their debt-servicing ability. This calls for
continued monitoring of balance-sheet risks at the corporate and household level, especially
given possible currency mismatches. While competing for market share, some banks may
have built up higher credit risk. Pressed by rising funding costs, large banks are likely to raise
lending interest rates soon—for the first time since the beginning of the credit boom.
Although stress tests based on end-2006 data suggest that the banking system can absorb
losses from asset quality deterioration and is resilient to risks of slowing capital inflows,
supervisors should not hesitate in encouraging banks to strengthen their capital positions—
especially given banks’ reliance on external borrowing. Staff welcomed the CBBH’s plan to
soon publish its 2007 financial stability report (FSR), featuring more recent stress tests.
27.
There was agreement that containing risks to financial stability would require
better risk management. Staff welcomed measures to mitigate risks, such as the regulation
on disclosing effective interest rates to improve transparency, and the relaxation of maturity
matching rules to ease pressures to borrow from abroad. Moreover, the two banking agencies
have introduced new regulations on liquidity, market, and operational risk management, and
have begun to take on supervision of leasing companies and micro-credit organizations.
Further enhancing supervisory oversight of risk management will require strengthening the

28
capacity of supervisors and improving statistics. Thus, staff welcomed CBBH’s efforts to
utilize credit registry data in its FSR and construct real estate price indices.
28.
Progress on information sharing between the CBBH and banking agencies needs
to be complemented by better coordination at the policy level. Staff welcomed the newlysigned MOU on information exchange, which advances the financial stability work program
at the technical level, and encouraged the CBBH and banking agencies to inform each other
of monetary policy and major prudential decisions. Improved coordination should also be
extended to plans to tighten asset classification and provisioning rules to take into account
the credit cycle and the banking system's health. Finally, staff reiterated the long-standing
recommendation to unify bank supervision, but the authorities argued that this step would
need to await constitution reform.
29.
CBBH officials recognize the importance of strengthening crisis-preparedness
arrangements. They are reviewing existing procedures and intend to formulate a
comprehensive crisis-management plan. Staff encouraged these efforts and highlighted the
need to coordinate regulatory and prudential actions with foreign regulators.
D. Capacity Building
30.
Improving the quality of statistics and strengthening capacity are prerequisites
for successful economic management. Most importantly, the quality, coverage, and
timeliness of fiscal data need improvement, to enhance the effectiveness of the Fiscal
Council.10 The recently-completed Data ROSC provides a roadmap. Moreover, expertise and
capacity at various relevant institutions needs upgrading, while the CBBH’s observer status
in the Council offers it a crucial advisory role in the currency-board setting.
IV. STAFF APPRAISAL
31.
Bosnia and Herzegovina’s economy has been performing relatively well. Real
GDP growth averaged 5.2 percent during 2002−07, thus leading to a level of per capita
income above the Balkan average, and inflation remained low until mid-2007. These
achievements largely reflect the benefits of the currency board, and the effects of reforms in
key sectors and the financial system.
32.
But policymakers now face several challenges. The current account deficit
currently exceeds sustainable levels, although there is no strong evidence of a significantly
overvalued real exchange rate at present that could result in future external instability.
However, going forward, more expansionary fiscal and public-sector wage policies could
threaten competitiveness and increase risks to external stability. Inflation pressures are on the
10

For example, due to different coverage, there is a discrepancy between the 2007 fiscal positions estimated by
the staff and the authorities (Table 13).

29
rise, largely reflecting global shocks to food and energy prices, but underlying inflation
pressures have also intensified. Unsettled global financial markets and a worsening economic
environment in Europe pose risks to the country’s stability and growth prospects. Finally, a
number of long-standing distortions—e.g., the inefficient public sector and overregulated
business environment—remain.
33.
In these circumstances, fiscal and incomes policies should be tightened.
Following last year’s procyclical fiscal relaxation, fiscal policy intentions point to further
expansion in 2008. This would exacerbate domestic demand pressures and keep the current
account deficit at unsustainable levels. Amid signs of increasing macroeconomic instability,
it would have been appropriate to respond to the private-sector absorption boom by avoiding
fiscal stimulus in 2008. While this may not be feasible at this stage, the fiscal stance in 2008
should be significantly tightened compared to what is planned under the budget and a
balanced budget targeted for 2009. To this end, limiting the general government deficit to up
to 1 percent of GDP in 2008 would put it on a credible consolidation path toward balance
over the medium term. Such a target would help stabilize the economy and ensure fiscal
sustainability, without crowding out the private sector. Moreover, privatization proceeds
should be used to support BiH’s growth objectives without compromising macroeconomic
stability; and a strong institutional framework for public-private partnerships should be put in
place. Finally, it is important to maintain wage discipline in the public sector.
34.
Fiscal policy coordination and budgetary practices need to be strengthened. The
establishment of the Fiscal Council and the agreement on a permanent indirect tax revenue
allocation formula are crucial steps toward a more coordinated fiscal policy. The Council
should be made operational as soon as possible and play a role in the design of the 2009
budget, setting medium-term fiscal targets, and mandating harmonization in fiscal reporting.
Moreover, fiscal expertise and capacity should be upgraded, and budgetary procedures
overhauled in the Federation to ensure new legislation is funded.
35.
Maintaining financial stability requires further improving risk management and
close policy coordination. Bank supervisors have made major progress in containing risks to
financial stability with the introduction of new regulations on liquidity, market and
operational risk management, and the expanded coverage of their supervision to include
leasing companies. Going forward, supervisors need to give priority to further improve the
oversight of risk management, closely monitor credit risk, and encourage banks to increase
capital buffers, if necessary. And close policy coordination—beyond information
exchange—between the CBBH and bank supervisors will be needed. Unification of banking
supervision remains necessary for financial stability and for establishing cooperation with
key foreign supervisors.
36.
Poor data quality impedes effective surveillance. Although important progress has
been made to improve statistics, major problems remain with the timeliness and coverage of

30
fiscal data. The authorities should persevere with their efforts and follow up on the
recommendations of the recently-completed Data ROSC.
37.
BiH has not accepted the obligations under Article VIII, Sections 2, 3, and 4, but
maintains restrictions on the transferability of balances and interest accrued on frozen
foreign-currency deposits, subject to Fund jurisdiction under Article VIII. Staff does not
recommend approval of these restrictions.
38.
It is proposed that the next Article IV consultation be held on the standard 12-month
cycle.

Sources: CBBH; and IMF staff estimates.
1/ Data for March 2005 onward are based on the upgraded classification of general government, so there is a structural break in March 2005.
2/ The jump in broad money growth in 2004 reflects banks' efforts to mobilize foreign currency deposits, following a tightening of end-month
forex exposure limits. Further regulatory changes in late 2004 dampened these efforts.

Table 11. Bosnia & Herzegovina: Implementation of FSAP and Staff Recommendations
Key FSAP and Staff Recommendations
Financial sector surveillance
• Develop a financial sector surveillance unit
within the CBBH that reports and disseminate
financial stability report (FSR)
• Improve the quality of data on credit by
extending the CBBH credit registry to cover all
borrowers (corporate and households)

Progress
Financial sector surveillance
• Done. Financial Stability Unit established in
2006. The FSR for 2006 was published for
internal use. The FSR for 2007 will be
published and publicly disseminated in 2008.
• Done. From the beginning of 2007, the CBBH
credit registry covers all borrowers and
guarantors

Bank Supervision and Regulation
• Upgrade supervision of bank provisioning and
loan evaluation
• Foster a shift from foreign to local financing by
relaxing tight limits on maturity mismatches
and introduce a regulatory capital charge for
market and other risks
• Raise the fines for non-compliance with
prudential regulations
• Strengthen the independence, powers and
capacity of banking supervisors.
• Strengthen consolidated supervision and
cooperation with the home country supervisors
of the major foreign-owned banks in BiH.

Bank Supervision and Regulation
• Not done. Still in the process of developing
new provisioning regulations.
• Done. A comprehensive guideline for
liquidity management was introduced at end2007. Regulations to phase in capital charges
for market risks were also introduced.
• Not done. Raising fines will need
parliamentary approval.
• Ongoing.

Organization of Supervision
• Unify two banking agencies at the State level

Bank Supervision and Regulation
• Not done. Unifying the agencies implies a
transfer of competencies from the Entities to a
State-level agency which cannot be decided
separately from the broader constitutional
debate.

Deposit Insurance
• Develop specific contingent arrangements for
the Deposit Insurance Agency in case of
possible shortfalls in its fund.

Deposit Insurance
• Ongoing. A contingent arrangement is being
developed together with the EBRD.

Non-Bank Supervision
• Approve leasing legislation

Non-Bank Supervision
• Ongoing. Both banking agencies are now
mandated by law to supervise leasing
companies. Law on leasing was adopted in
the RS, and is expected to be adopted in the
Federation by end-2008.
• Ongoing. Regulations on better data provision
were recently introduced in both entities.
• Done. Microcredit institutions are now
regulated by the Banking Agencies.

•

Strengthen insurance supervision

•

Approve micro finance legislation and
strengthen oversights of microcredit institutions

Strengthening Corporate Governance
• Strengthen disclosure of beneficial owners,
quality of financial reporting, accountability of
corporate bodies and effectiveness of regulatory
agencies.

•

Partially done. The Bosnian supervisors have
not been able to sign an MOU with the
Austrian supervisor.

Strengthening Corporate Governance
• Partially done. In the RS, a new company law
was approved and financial reporting
strengthened and disseminated.

Table 12. Bosnia & Herzegovina: Response to Past Fund Policy Recommendations

The authorities have broadly agreed with Fund recommendations and notable progress
has been made recently on fiscal coordination. However, goals are not always translated
into coherent policy plans, there is no medium-term fiscal framework, and the reform
momentum is slow.
Fiscal policy

Fiscal coordination

Financial sector

The easing in 2007 and the projected further easing in
2008 are inappropriate. The size of government is
excessive, there has been no progress in rationalizing
spending, and untargeted (and unfunded) social transfers
are on the rise in the Federation. On the positive side,
income tax reforms have been successfully completed in
the Entities.
Notable progress has been achieved in 2008: the Fiscal
Council law was adopted, and a permanent (indirect tax)
revenue allocation mechanism agreed.

The authorities responded positively to the 2006 FSAP
recommendations. The recently-established financial
sector surveillance unit within the Central Bank of BiH
(CBBH) started producing a financial stability report;
and closer coordination between the entity bank
supervisors and the CBBH advanced with the signing of
a memorandum of understanding (MOU) on information
exchange. However, unification of bank supervision
remains elusive and is contingent on progress with
constitutional reform.

ATTACHMENT I

BOSNIA & HERZEGOVINA: DEBT SUSTAINABILITY ANALYSIS
The debt sustainability analysis is based on the staff baseline scenario (unchanged
policies). It assumes moderate growth and inflation over the medium term; and fiscal deficits
in the order of 2–3 percent of GDP.
After an initial jump in 2007, reflecting the settlement of domestic claims, and
subsequent increases in 2008–09 to 38 percent of GDP, the public debt-to-GDP ratio
stabilizes at that level over the medium term. The issuance of bonds to cover domestic
claims in 2007–09 is estimated to total about 25 percentage points of GDP (see Box 1).
Assuming no policy changes, the debt would stay broadly at that level. The dynamics of the
debt outlook are fairly robust to interest rate shocks, but a growth slowdown or a fiscal
deterioration could put the debt on an unsustainable path. Also, contingent risks remain,
related to debt from unrestructured public enterprises and court claims for Frozen Foreign
Currency Deposits. With the balanced budget policy (as recommended by staff), the debt to
GDP ratio would decline more rapidly, to around 22 percent of GDP by 2013, significantly
bolstering the country’s debt sustainability.

Box 1. Key Assumptions for the Public Debt Sustainability Analysis
•

Moderate growth and inflation, and unchanged policies in line with the staff’s baseline
projections. General government registers deficits around 2–3 percent of GDP (Table 9).

•

Lower access to concessional external borrowing (average grant element of 35 percent),
dropping to ¾ percent of GDP during 2008–13 compared to around 1.5 percent in 2005.

•

Domestic borrowing on commercial terms (6-month Euribor plus 200 basis points) to cover
residual financing needs.

•

Increase in debt by 11.5 percent of GDP in 2007 due to the recognition of frozen foreign
currency deposits and war claims, with an average grant element of 53 percent.

•

Increase in the face value of debt to about 10 percent of GDP in 2008 and 5 percent in 2009,
due to the recognition of additional domestic claims (restitution, losses of public enterprises,
etc. on similar terms as the FFCD). This also covers the assumption of public enterprise debt of
the mining sector expected in 2009, totaling 1½ percent of GDP.

•

Privatization proceeds of 9 percent of GDP in the Federation in 2009.

46
Bosnia & Herzegovina’s external debt-to-GDP ratio slightly improves over the medium
term, even in the absence of policy change. This reflects the assumption that economic
growth will remain above the real effective interest rate on external debt, as the latter reflects
a large share of concessional debt—notably to the World Bank, and also the smaller role of
debt-creating flows in financing the current account deficits (Box 2). Although current
account deficits remain sizable, the projection assumes that FDI and reserves rundown are
the major sources of financing as commercial banks’ external borrowing is projected to
moderate with a slow-down in credit growth and public sector’s external borrowing is
projected to remain relatively flat. Gross external financing needs as a percentage of GDP
increase in 2008 due to the terms-of-trade shock, but decline over the projection period.
Bound tests show limited risks, with debt-to-GDP ratios at the end of 2013 lower than 50
percent in all scenarios. A change in the borrowing structure (from public to private or from
concessional to nonconcessional) could also weaken the dynamics of Bosnia and
Herzegovina’s external debt, although this risk appears manageable.

Box 2. Key Assumptions for the External Debt Sustainability Analysis
•

Moderate growth and inflation, and unchanged policies in line with the staff’s baseline
projections (Table 9).

•

Decelerating growth rate of exports and imports (in value).

•

Limited access to concessional external borrowing, with new borrowing at market rates. World
Bank disbursements declining sharply during the projection period.

•

A decline in commercial banks’ borrowing as banks mobilize more domestic funds.

•

Stable remittances inflows, and declining income inflows due to the reduction of international
organizations staff.

•

Capital transfers and errors and omissions are included in the non-debt creating flows.

VII. Safeguards Assessment
Under the Fund's safeguards assessment policy, Central Bank of Bosnia and
Herzegovina (CBBH) was subject to an assessment in the context of a potential
successor for the 2002 arrangement. The assessment was completed on January 24,
2005 and recommendations were made to address weaknesses identified in the Bank's
safeguards. Based on the information received from the authorities all the
recommendations have been implemented.
VIII. Exchange Rate Arrangements
The currency of Bosnia and Herzegovina is the convertible marka (KM), introduced on
August 11, 1997. On September 5, 2002, the State parliament approved an amendment
to the CBBH law that changes the peg of the KM from the DM to the Euro under a
currency board arrangement. The KM is pegged to the euro at KM 1 = 0.5113 euro.
Bosnia and Herzegovina maintains restrictions on payments and transfers for current
international transactions resulting from measures taken with respect to frozen foreign
currency deposits as identified in IMF Country Report No. 02/52.
IX. FSAP
Two FSAP missions took place in December 2005 and March 2006, and an Aide
Mémoire was presented to the authorities. The FSAP assessed risks to financial stability
and weaknesses in banking supervision using a Basel Core Principles assessment. It
also considers financial sector development needs in the areas of insurance, access to
finance, the insolvency regime and corporate governance, drawing on a detailed
assessment of the OECD Principles of Good Corporate Governance. The FSSA was
presented to the Board along with the 2006 Article IV consultation IMF Country Report
No. 06/371.
X.

Last Article IV Consultation
Bosnia and Herzegovina is on the twelve month cycle, subject to the provisions of the
decision on consultation cycles approved on July 15, 2002. The last Article IV
consultation was concluded on July 16, 2007.

XI. Resident Representative
IMF no longer has a resident representative in Bosnia and Herzegovina. Mr. Slack was
the resident representative until end-July 2008. The office in Sarajevo remains open and
is staffed by a local economist and support staff.

APPENDIX II—BOSNIA & HERZEGOVINA: WORLD BANK RELATIONS
A. New Country Partnership Strategy for Bosnia and Herzegovina (FY08-FY11)
1.
On December 13, 2007, the World Bank Board of Executive Directors endorsed a
new Country Partnership Strategy (CPS) for Bosnia and Herzegovina. The new CPS
outlines a lending program of about US$ 200 million in support of the country’s priorities,
including integration with the European Union. The CPS will support Government’s
priorities outlined in the Platform for Action adopted on October 16, 2007. The Paper, which
was signed by the State and Entity level Prime Ministers, and the Mayor of Brcko District,
commits the authorities to: (i) improve fiscal coordination and stability; (ii) create a better
business environment; and (iii) promote other reforms ensuring sustainable development.
2.

The FY08-FY11 CPS is structured along two mutually reinforcing pillars.
•

Pillar I – improve the environment for private sector led growth and convergence to
Europe (expand business activity and increase economic opportunities; improvements
in key infrastructure and links to Europe; regional approach to public goods,
including environment and clean energy)

•

Pillar II – improve the quality of Government spending and the delivery of public
services for the vulnerable (improve delivery of municipal services and strengthen
mucnipal finance; improve quality of social services delivery; reduce urban-rural
disparities in income; increase targeting of social benefits; reduce excess burden of
Government in economy and strengthen fiscal coordination)

3.
Through this program the World Bank will support investments in infrastructure,
municipal development, transport and energy sectors, business environment, public sector
reform, and social sectors reform. With a mix of financial and non-financial services, the
World Bank will support the Government to achieve their development goals of improving
infrastructure and the investment climate, increasing the efficiency of public spending, and
strengthening service delivery - in particular those directed to the most vulnerable segments
of the population.
B. World Bank Projects
4.
While no longer receiving the levels of financing following the 1995 Dayton Accord,
Bosnia and Herzegovina still enjoys exceptional access to concessional IDA financing
despite income per capita well-above the IDA threshold. However, this CPS period will mark
a transition from borrowing under IDA conditions to more commercial, but still relatively cheap
borrowing under IBRD conditions (note: IBRD recently significantly reduced its pricing and
improved loan terms and conditions). The current portfolio includes 15 active projects (14 IDA

investment loans, and one GEF grant) with a total commitment of US$275 million, of which
about 64% remain to be disbursed.

55
5.
Improving the business environment with support from the Business Environment
Adjustment Credit (BAC) was critical in strengthening growth and employment and
encouraging investment. Although delayed, supporting legislation has now been passed in
both entities. Consequently, intended outcomes in business registration and inspection
reforms have been achieved and conditions for disbursement of the final US$ 30 million
tranche were met in December 2007. BAC closed on 15 December, 2007.
6.
Recent approved projects. The Road Infrastructure and Safety Project, approved
in December 2007 is a US$ 25 million operation aimed at accelerating the recovery of the
main road network and improving institutional capacity in relation to road safety. The project
will finance rehabilitation of about 240 kilometers of regional roads in both entities. The
project will also help develop a strategy for improving road safety in the country. US$ 25
million of IDA credit by the World Bank is a part of a broader road rehabilitation program
financed by the two entity governments, the European Investment Bank, and the European
Bank for Reconstruction and Development. Two new projects (Agriculture and Rural
Development; and Avian Influenza Preparedness Project) and two supplemental financing
for two existing projects (Urban Infrastructure and Service Delivery; and Forest
Development and Conservation Project) amounting in total to about US$35 million, were
recently declared effective.
7.
Project pipeline. Two GEF grants, Neretva and Trebisnjica River Basin
Management Project, and Protected Forest and Mountain Areas, were negotiated in
March-April 2008 and will be presented to GEF Board for approval. The total amount of
grant financing under these two operations will be US$ 9.4 million. Follow up Solid Waste
Management Project is scheduled for negotiations in June 2008 and will provide US$ 35
million (blend of IDA and IBRD resources) for further investments in this sector.
8.
Key pieces of analytic and advisory services that will be provided in 2008 include:
Investment Climate Assessment, and Proxy Means Targeting Study. Country Economic
Memorandum, focuses on trade: it attempts to assess the binding constraints to growth of
BiH export and import-competing industries, in particular in wood processing and
automotive industries, as well as agriculture.

APPENDIX III—BOSNIA & HERZEGOVINA: STATISTICAL ISSUES
1. Data provided to the Fund have serious shortcomings that significantly hamper
surveillance, most notably in the area of balance of payments statistics and the source data
for government finance statistics. Real sector statistics have recently been upgraded, with
2006 data for GDP by expenditure at current and constant prices, GDP by industry at
constant prices, and a countrywide consumer price index (CPI) based on internationally
recommended practices. However, there is a lack of short-term economic indicators and the
source data for national accounts need improvement.
2. The Dayton peace treaty, which ended the civil war, implicitly gave responsibility for
statistical functions to the two resulting Entities (The Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina
and Republika Srpska (RS)). In August 1998, the State created its own statistical institute, the
Bosnia & Herzegovina Agency for Statistics (BHAS) with a view to compiling country-wide
statistics in accordance with internationally accepted methodologies, consolidating data
produced by the Entities’ Statistical Institutes, and acting as the primary coordinating agency
for contacts with international agencies. Significant technical assistance has been provided in
recent years, mainly by the European Union. An IFS country page has been in existence
since July 2001. A Fund resident statistical advisor was assigned to the Central Bank of
Bosnia & Herzegovina (CBBH) during May 1999–June 2004 to provide technical assistance
in the development of all areas of macroeconomic statistics. A STA resident real sector
statistical advisor was appointed in the period November 2005–November 2007. A mission
to prepare the ROSC Data Module took place in March 2007 and the report was published in
February 2008.
A. Real Sector Statistics
3. Efforts have been made in both Entities to improve real sector statistics, but results have
been mixed. The Federation and RS both have published nominal GDP estimates using the
production approach based on international standards recommended by the 1993 SNA,
since 1998 and 1999, respectively. GDP estimates by production at constant prices have been
developed with the technical assistance of the IMF and these estimates have been released for
the entities and for the country with 2004 as the reference year. Also, expenditure-based GDP
data at current and constant prices have been developed. These data, which are now being
regularly compiled by the BHAS, have been made available for the period 2004-2006. Other
improvements include coverage adjustments made to GDP with the inclusion of an estimate
for nonobserved economic activities and imputation of rental services of owner-occupied
dwellings. Discrepancies between the production and expenditure measures of GDP are
relatively high and more work will be needed to reconcile these estimates.
4. Both statistical offices compile retail price indices using outdated methodologies, and
consistent time series are not available. A consumer price index (CPI) based on
internationally recommended practices has been implemented with the technical and
financial support of the Italian government. This CPI was released in 2007, and monthly and
consistent series are available countrywide and for the entities, with the series starting in

57
January 2005. The CPI weights are derived from the household budget survey conducted in
2004. Industrial production indices are prepared in each Entity, but there is no index at the
country level and consistent time series are not available. Both entity institutes compile data
on employment, unemployment, and wage rates based on questionable methodologies.
However, the recent Labor Force Survey conducted in April 2007 follows international
methodological standards. Data on employment, unemployment, population and labor force
for the country and the entities are available for 2006 and 2007. The data for 2006 and 2007
are also available in a dissagregate form for different socio-demographic groups.
B. External Sector Statistics
5. Trade data are published by the BHAS and balance of payments statistics by the CBBH.
The quality of the balance of payments data is generally poor, particularly the coverage of
foreign grants, workers’ remittances, income received by residents working for international
organizations in the country, spending by their nonresident staff, trade credit by suppliers,
informal trade, and changes in foreign currency cash holdings.
6. Merchandise trade is recorded using the Automated System for Customs Data processing
system. The customs administration for the whole country has been reorganized, and a trade
classification system introduced. BHAS now produces export and import data from customs
records, but needs to produce the data on a general trade basis and not on a special trade
basis.
C. Government Finance Statistics
7. The CBBH compiles government finance statistics (GFS) in accordance with the
definitions and concepts of the Government Finance Statistics Manual 2001. The 2007 data
ROSC mission found that the institutional coverage of the GFS is broadly consistent with
international guidelines, but not all stocks and flows are measured due to insufficient source
data. In addition, the GFS does not include transactions related to projects directly financed
by international donors. Because accrual accounting has not yet been fully introduced in all
government institutions, transactions are recorded on a mixed accrual/cash basis. Data on the
level of outstanding domestic debt are being developed. The periodicity and timeliness of
data on government operations and quarterly consolidated central government operations
meet or exceed GDDS recommendations. External government debt is published quarterly.
GFS data are broadly consistent with the balance of payments, but not with the national
accounts or monetary and banking statistics.
8.
Since 2005, the CBBH has reported GFS to STA for publication in the Government
Finance Statistics Yearbook, covering central government operations starting with data
for 2003. Higher frequency fiscal data have been reported for publication in the IFS: the
CBBH has submitted quarterly GFS data up to 2007Q3. However, there has been no new
submission for data after that date. The authorities are aware of this delay in data reporting;

58
and the IMF resident statistical advisor is following up on this issue. The CBBH has been
receiving ongoing technical assistance on GFS compilation from the resident statistical
advisor.
D. Monetary and Financial Statistics
9. The CBBH reports monetary accounts to the Fund on a countrywide and Entity basis. In
early 2003, it began reporting weighted average interest rates for bank deposits and loans.
The IFS includes interest rate data since January 2002. From 1996 to 2004, several Fund
missions assisted in establishing an integrated system for compiling countrywide monetary
statistics compatible with Fund standards. The April/May 2004 mission reviewed
institutional changes and accounting developments and assisted in revising and updating the
compilation procedures. The mission recommended improvements in the treatment of
“passive accounts” on banks’ balance sheets, banks’ claims arising from “credit card debts,”
“euro-linked” loans in national currency, and government accounts. The CBBH has been
working towards reporting monetary data to the Fund using the Standardized Report Forms
developed by STA that embody the methodology of the Monetary and Financial Statistics
Manual.

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2008 Article IV Consultation with
Bosnia and Herzegovina
On September 17, 2008, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF)
concluded the Article IV consultation with Bosnia and Herzegovina.1
Background
Bosnia and Herzegovina's economy has been exhibiting robust growth, but
macroeconomic imbalances have emerged. In 2007, the economy grew by 5.8 percent,
with domestic demand becoming an engine of growth, supported by robust credit
growth, healthy wage increases, and a sizeable fiscal impulse. The domestic demand
boom was mirrored by a widening external current account deficit, which reached
13 percent of GDP. Export growth moderated to 15 percent, and imports resumed their
faster growth following a temporary, VAT-related slowdown in 2006. Data for early-2008
point to a further widening of the current account deficit, mainly driven by higher food
and energy prices. Headline inflation increased to 8.2 percent in May 2008, reflecting
largely food and energy price shocks although underlying inflation has also picked up.
Fiscal policy has become procyclical and added further stimulus to domestic demand.
The general government registered a deficit of 0.1 percent of GDP in 2007, compared
with a 2.2 percent surplus in 2006. Driven mainly by sharp increases in transfers to
households, capital spending, and wages, total government expenditure approached
50 percent of GDP in 2007. Strong revenue performance has continued in 2008, but
mounting spending pressures in the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina
(Federation) have led to liquidity problems and threaten its fiscal position.
1

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On return
to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the Executive
Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the Board,
summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the country's
authorities.

61
Financial deepening accelerated in 2007, but remains in line with regional trends.
Benefiting from a low interest rate environment, private sector credit growth in 2007
contributed 7.7 percentage points to the credit-to-GDP ratio, bringing it to 56 percent.
Concerns about the speed of credit expansion prompted the Central Bank of Bosnia
and Herzegovina (CBBH) to increase reserve requirements at end-2007—from 15 to
18 percent. There are early indications that global financial tensions have started to
affect foreign funding. While bank soundness indicators remain favorable, bank
profitability declined in the first quarter of 2008.
A breakthrough has recently been made on fiscal structural reforms with the approval of
the Fiscal Council law and an agreement on a permanent indirect tax revenue allocation
formula. However, progress on other structural reforms has been uneven and Bosnia
and Herzegovina trails its best-performing peers on most structural indicators.
Moreover, policies are diverging between the two Entities, with the Republika Srpska
(RS) making steady progress on reforms and the Federation finding it difficult to
mobilize action on needed reforms. The signing of the Stabilization and Association
Agreement with the European Union (EU) on June 16, 2008, opens Bosnia and
Herzegovina's road to EU accession and could help accelerate reforms.
Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors welcomed Bosnia and Herzegovina's solid growth performance,
which largely reflects the effects of reforms in key sectors, the benefits of the currency
board, and a favorable external environment. Directors congratulated the authorities on
the recent signing of the Stabilization and Association Agreement with the EU, and
hoped that it would become a catalyst for accelerated progress in structural reforms.
At the same time, Directors expressed concern about the emerging macroeconomic
imbalances and the unfinished structural reform agenda. They noted that the current
account deficit has been moving toward unsustainable levels, underlying inflationary
pressures have intensified, and the recent fiscal policy loosening is exacerbating
demand pressures. While noting the staff's assessment that the level of the real
effective exchange rate does not raise significant external stability concerns at this
stage, Directors emphasized that the key challenge for the authorities will be to
strengthen policies and enhance structural reforms to reduce vulnerabilities, promote
sustainable strong growth, and reduce unemployment. This will require improved policy
coordination, and a tighter fiscal and incomes policy stance to counteract private sectordriven macroeconomic imbalances and support the currency board, which has served
the economy well.
Directors welcomed the authorities' intention to tighten the fiscal stance in 2008, and
encouraged the authorities to aim for a balanced budget target in 2009. They
underscored the importance of maintaining wage discipline in the public sector,
reducing large, untargeted social spending, and improving the efficiency of the public
sector. Containing unfunded social transfers in the Federation will require their
fundamental overhaul. Directors also encouraged the authorities to use privatization
proceeds to support the country's growth objectives without compromising
macroeconomic stability.

62
Directors emphasized the need for improved fiscal policy coordination. They welcomed
the recent establishment of the Fiscal Council and agreement on a permanent indirect
tax revenue-allocation formula. The Fiscal Council should be made operational as soon
as possible and should be assigned a coordinating role in the design of the 2009
general government budget and in the setting of medium-term fiscal targets. A more
medium-term-oriented fiscal policy would not only help maintain sound public finances
but would also increase the efficiency of public spending. Moreover, budgetary
procedures in the Federation need to be overhauled to ensure that new legislation is
funded.
Directors welcomed the authorities' efforts to contain risks to financial stability, and
encouraged the authorities to further improve the oversight of risk management, closely
monitor credit risk, and urge banks to increase capital buffers, if necessary. Directors
welcomed the signing of the memorandum of understanding on cooperation among the
central bank and the two banking supervisors, and encouraged the authorities to
intensify the policy coordination between these institutions and to continue to work
toward unifying bank supervision.
Directors welcomed recent progress in improving statistics, and encouraged the
authorities to persevere with their efforts to improve data quality, including by following
up on the recommendations of the recently-completed Data Report on the Observance
of Standards and Codes (ROSC).

Public Information Notices (PINs) form part of the IMF's efforts to promote transparency of the IMF's
views and analysis of economic developments and policies. With the consent of the country
(or countries) concerned, PINs are issued after Executive Board discussions of Article IV consultations
with member countries, of its surveillance of developments at the regional level, of post-program

Statement by Age Bakker, Executive Director for Bosnia and Herzegovina and
Miroslav Tomic, Advisor to Executive Director
September 17, 2008
Introduction
The authorities of Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) would like to thank the staff for the
constructive and analytical discussions during their visit in June 2008, as well as for the
cooperation through the Resident Representative’s office and technical assistance projects.
The authorities broadly agree with staff’s analysis and share their views regarding the
economic challenges ahead. The authorities consent to publication of the report.
The economy of BiH booked impressive results in the last several years: the average annual
growth rate was almost 6 per cent, and the general price level, except in 2006 when VAT was
introduced, was stable with average inflation in 2007 under the euro zone rate. From 2004 to
2008 the global export share more than doubled and external debt service more than halved,
to 8% in terms of goods and services exports. The total public debt stands at the comfortable
level of 30.5 percent of GDP. The fact that primary surpluses were registered in the last 5
years is a very strong indicator of prudent policy making. As a result of secured macro
stability, the level of income achieved is above the Balkan region average. These impressive
results can be contributed to the currency board regime which provided a nominal anchor,
institutional reforms, particularly in the financial, tax system and business regulation sectors,
and a beneficial external environment. The previous Fund involvement and
recommendations, although sometimes hotly debated, contributed to this positive picture.
However, despite achieved macro stability, the major economic problem, a 29%
unemployment rate1, remains unsolved. The high level of - mainly structural –unemployment
creates economic waste, complicates prudent policy making and leaves less discretion in
expenditure policy.
Macroeconomic development and outlook
The external environment deteriorated rapidly at the end of 2007. Although the global
financial crisis did not have any substantial negative impact on the BiH economy so far, it
did decrease the growth prospects of major trading partners. At the same time, global food
and oil prices increased sharply, resulting in the CPI measured inflation pickup at the end of
2007. The same trend has continued in 2008, although BiH’s inflation still compares
favorably to that of peer countries. The authorities allowed an instantaneous pass through of
global food and oil prices and managed to resist strong pressure by the public that requested
changes in the indirect taxation system as a short-term attempt to contain inflation
1

This is the data from Labor Force Survey based on ILO’s methodology for 2007. Unemployment rates
vary across the regions and entities: in the Federation BiH unemployment rate is 31.1%, in Republika Srpska
25.2%.

65
(introduction of the (second) lower VAT rate, introduction of the zero rate for food,
abolishment of the excise on oil, etc.).
As leading indicators of economic activity suggest, real growth in 2008 is likely to continue
in the healthy range between 5-6%. While there has been a positive trend in the labor market
in the first half of 2008, when the officially registered employment increased by 14% yearon-year, the extremely low labor participation rate of 43.1% cannot be ignored. The overall
macroeconomic outlook for the BiH economy remains positive: while the external
environment has deteriorated compared to previous years, the institutional set-up for policy
making in BIH has substantially improved. On the political front, BiH signed a Stabilization
and Association Agreement (SAA) with the European Union (EU) and, in terms of economic
policy making, the Law on Fiscal Council (FC), that will provide for better intergovernmental coordination, and was a major concern of several recent Article IV consultations, has
been adopted.
Fiscal Policy
The authorities share the staff’s assessment that fiscal policy is the main tool to safeguard
macroeconomic stability, and are confident that fiscal policy will continue to contribute to
both stability and overall economic development. Besides progress in the fiscal architecture
through the adoption of the FC Law which will enable effective medium-term fiscal
framework planning, a permanent solution to the indirect tax revenue allocation between the
entities was enacted in June 2008. The implemented reforms started delivering: the reform in
direct taxes, adopted at the entity level under the USAID project, not only introduced modern
and transparent tax systems but started producing tangible results. The Republika Srpska
(RS) corporate income tax revenues increased by 30% during the first half of 2008 and
similar results are expected in the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina (FBiH) when the
adopted legislation is implemented in 2009. The direct tax rates (CIT 10% and PIT10%, with
few exemptions) stand reasonably attractive in regional comparison. In addition, both entities
are contemplating changes in the legislation that regulates social contributions, with a view to
making formal employment more attractive. By establishing a Reserve Pension Fund,
Republika Srpska embarked on a process of pension reform.
While moderate fiscal relaxation is expected in 2008, the authorities are confident that the
consolidated fiscal position will be below 1% of GDP deficit, a target recommended by the
staff. Despite the fall in custom revenues due to the application of the Trade Agreement with
the EU as of July 2008, the Indirect Taxation Authority (ITA) will collect 5% more indirect
tax revenues in 2008 than planned. However, besides the overall optimism associated with
future EU accession, the Finance Ministers are aware of the revenue loss due to the free trade
agreement and have continued to look for improvements in the tax system. The Republika
Srpska will introduce a modern property tax, aimed at broadening the base and taxing
property at market value rather than per physical unit as is currently the case. It is expected
that this law will be enforced as of January 1, 2010. In addition, and in line with European

66
best practice, changes in lottery and gambling regulations are envisaged. Similar preparatory
activities are ongoing in FBiH.
Historical evidence reveals prudence in fiscal policy and the future position seems even more
promising: after the FBiH adopted the Law on Debt and Guarantees in 2007, now all levels
of government are bound by the law in terms of debt creation and borrowing. By the enacted
rule, debt service cannot exceed 18% of the revenues collected in the previous year. This
setup, along with the relatively comfortable current debt level, provides a strong framework
for securing fiscal sustainability. That said, the authorities remain aware of opportunities to
decrease public spending and of options to further strengthen the public expenditure
management system, and to link public expenditures to outcomes. Under the project
supported by the DFID, program-based budgeting has been initiated.
The authorities believe that staff’s policy advice with respect to a balanced overall position
over the medium term seems reasonable and accepts its recommendations as it gives enough
flexibility.
External balance and competitiveness
Although a limited widening of the current account balance is expected in 2008, a substantial
part of this deterioration is due to higher food and oil prices. Given that the governments of
both entities have increased subsidies for agriculture, as well as the fact that price increases
make this production more profitable, it is expected that pressure on food imports will
diminish in the near future. In addition, the only oil refinery in BIH was privatized and is
currently under reconstruction. It is expected that production will begin by the end of
October 2008, which could further contribute to a lower import value since instead of the
final product, BiH will import crude oil. However, the widening of the current account deficit
is also a consequence of increased investment spending as the increased share in imports of
machinery shows, and could be read as a positive sign since it will contribute to future export
growth and a more balanced external position. Given the stable financing sources (in 2007
FDI were 14% of the GDP), the authorities are confident that the current account deficit
widening is only a temporary phenomenon, as staff’s analysis confirms, since the current
account deficit is projected to decrease, even in the baseline scenario.
BiH‘s export share has more than doubled in the last couple of years and that export growth
rate has stabilized at a solid 15%. The fact that this was mainly due to productivity growth,
particularly in tradeables vis-a-vis main trading partners, supports optimism with respect to
future current account developments. Despite the recent growth in average wages, unit labor
costs are lower than they were in 2004. Finally, export performance and productivity growth
support the staff’s assessment that the exchange rate is in line with economic fundamentals.
That said, the authorities are aware of the recent modest appreciation of the real effective
exchange rate during the first quarter of 2008 and will continue careful monitoring of the
competitiveness indicators.

67
Financial stability and monetary policy
Although financial deepening accelerated in 2007, the banking system, mostly in hands of
foreign banks, still remains the dominant sector in the financial system. Confronted with
rapid credit growth in 2007, provided through long-term funding from abroad, the Central
Bank raised reserve requirements from 15 to 18 percent at the beginning of 2008. The
measure resulted in credit growth deceleration in 2008, and for the first time credit to
enterprises became bigger than credit to consumers. Global financial turbulence did not cause
capital outflows as BiH does not rely on volatile sources. Bank soundness indicators remain
satisfactory: capital adequacy remains high and the ratio of non-performing to total loans
decreased substantially compared to previous years. Bank profitability in the first quarter was
influenced by the recorded huge loss of only one bank while other banks had good results.
Most of the 2006 FSAP recommendations have been implemented (such as introduction of
comprehensive guidelines for liquidity management and broadening supervision of leasing
companies by a banking agency), or are currently in the process of implementation
(strengthening insurance supervision, strengthening corporate governance, etc.). Cognizant of
the need to improve coordination and cooperation in banking supervision across the entities
in the presence of constitutional limits for unification of the entity banking supervision
agencies, the Central Bank and entity agencies signed a Memorandum of Establishing Firm
Coordination in Banking Supervision in June 2008. The Memorandum, apart from regular
data exchange, also mandates cooperation in implementing the Core Basel Principles and
Directives of the European Union for Effective Surveillance. Currently, a strategy for
implementation of the Basel II Principles is being prepared. While banking sector resilience
against external shocks is adequate, the BiH authorities are devoted to improving monitoring
and cross border supervisory cooperation. During 2008, multilateral agreement on banking
supervision in South Eastern Europe was signed with Albania, Bulgaria, Cyprus, Greece,
Montenegro, Macedonia, Romania and Serbia.
Sovereign debt servicing is executed in a timely manner and the authorities remain absolutely
determined to keep as its first priority all debt servicing toward foreign creditors in the future.
While BiH could not join Article VIII due to an issue of frozen foreign currency deposits,
BiH is committed to maintaining a liberalized regime for capital and current transfers.
Finally, there is full political support for the currency board and absolute consensus on the
exit strategy, namely adoption of the euro in the context of accession to the European Union.
Privatization, Structural reforms, Infrastructure
The authorities are aware that privatization is still business unfinished, particularly in the
FBiH. In the Republika Srpska, privatization proceeds are planned to be used in a transparent
and accountable manner for the increase in productivity, infrastructure and removal of
bottlenecks. Given the big regional differences in development, part of the funds will be used
for revitalization of these areas, while other parts will be used to smoothen the reform of the
pension system. Infrastructure projects are long awaited and could contribute to capacity
increase and stimulate a higher labor activity rate. Implementation of the projects so far

68
confirms, however, that the authorities remain cautious about the potential implications on
the aggregate demand and the possible effect on prices.
According to the Federation BiH’s Strategy for the Energy Sector, BiH currently uses only
38% of its hydro energetic potential and is in a good position to become a leading regional
player in electric energy production. Several greenfield investments in the energy sector are
being negotiated, ranging from wind, hydro and thermal energy production facilities. British
ETF, a private company, is about to begin construction of Thermo plant Stanari whose
annual output could reach up to 25% of the current total electricity output, and substantially
increase the export potential of the country. This project has huge regional importance and
could speed up other investments.
Public Wages and Employment
The authorities share staff’s recommendation that keeping the public wage bill under control
is an essential component of fiscal prudence and important for preserving competitiveness.
Having said that, the authorities believe that long-standing major regulatory progress was
achieved in the public wage bill policy in 2008. Prior to the adoption of the law, wages for
the employees in the Institution of BiH were regulated by a dozen different legal acts, leading
frequently to inadequate relative ratios between similar positions and a low compression
ratio. Besides the relative salary structure, if an annual increase for experience allowance is
neglected (0.5% per annum), wages for employees in the Institutions of BiH have not been
increased for several years in nominal terms. The Council of Ministers (CoM) of BiH first
adopted the wage bill policy for 2008-2010, by which the growth of wage expenditures was
limited to up to 50% of the real economy growth rate. After that, the Law on Wages was
adopted which gives the option to the CoM to keep the wage envelope under control if the
fiscal position so requires. These instruments are expected to result in a decrease of the total
wage bill in GDP as well as of overall public expenditure and to provide more space for
capital investment. Adoption of the Law, however, is understood by the authorities as the
beginning of the process of public administration reform and not its end.
The increase of wages in Republika Srpska (RS) (Staff report, page 27) needs careful
assessment as it reflects the overall effort to modernize the public wage bill system by
introducing the so called gross principle (no tax exempt allowances), as well as the RS
government’s intention to improve the relative position of the education and health sectors,
given their critical importance for economic development. After a one-time adjustment of the
salaries in these sectors, the RS government is determined not to increase public salaries in
the next period. Finally, the authorities are aware of the need to have better coordination of
public wages to avoid both competition between different government levels and a negative
spillover effect to the private sector, and will pay attention to this issue in the future
functioning of the Fiscal Council. While higher public wages are not guaranteed to eradicate
corruption, they are an important element in the authorities’ overall attempt to fight
corruption and to improve the business environment.

69
Statistics
The authorities remain cognizant of the need to improve official statistics and are particularly
grateful for the ROSC report. Although data dissemination practices meet or exceed GDDS
recommendations for macroeconomic statistics, the data quality could be improved in many
areas. The recent compilation and monthly dissemination of the CPI, with the assistance of
the Italian government, represents important progress. The authorities, however, remain
determined to resolve the remaining issues in a timely manner, particularly given the
importance of statistics for integration into the European Union.
Going Forward…..
Fully aware of the many challenges ahead, particularly exacerbated by the global economic
deterioration, the authorities remain confident that the recent signing of the SAA agreement
represents a major incentive to speed up necessary reforms. The authorities look forward to
continued cooperation with international institutions, without whose assistance many
successfully implemented reforms would not have been possible, and reiterate their intention
to maintain close cooperation with the Fund in the years to come.
