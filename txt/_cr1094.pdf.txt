INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND
ARAB REPUBLIC OF EGYPT
Staff Report for the 2010 Article IV Consultation
Approved by Ratna Sahay and David Marston
March 9, 2010


This report is based on discussions held in Cairo during February 316, 2010. The
staff team comprised A. MacArthur (head), E. Arbatli, K. Moriyama, K. Ongley (all MCD),
M. Albino-War (FAD), and K. Youssef (MCM). Mr. Shaalan and Ms. Abdelati (both OED)
also participated in the technical and policy discussions.



Counterparts: Discussions were held with Ministers Boutros-Ghali (Finance), Mohieldin
(Investment), and Osman (Economic Development), Central Bank Governor El Okdah,
other government officials, as well as with representatives from the private sector,
academia, labor organizations, and the parliament.



Context of past surveillance: Five years of reforms and prudent macroeconomic
policies created the space needed to respond to the global financial crisis, and the
supportive fiscal and monetary policies of the past year have been in line with staff’s
advice. The authorities remain committed to resuming fiscal consolidation broadly in
keeping with past advice to address fiscal vulnerabilities.



Egypt’s exchange rate regime is classified as “other managed arrangement.” On
January 2, 2005, Egypt accepted the obligations under Article VIII, Sections 2, 3, and 4
of the Articles of Agreement. The exchange system is free of restrictions on payments
and transfers for current international transactions.



Strengthening data quality, and enhancing its coverage, timeliness and transparency
will greatly improve the effectiveness of surveillance and, importantly, help boost the
quality and communication of policy-making.



Consultation cycle: The last Article IV consultation was concluded on
December 22, 2008. The staff report was published and Directors’ comments can be
found at http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/cat/longres.cfm?sk=22646.0. The next
Article IV consultation will take place on the standard 12month cycle.

STAFF APPRAISAL1
1.
Egypt’s economy has been resilient to the crisis. Financial contagion was
contained by limited direct exposure to structured products and low levels of financial
integration with world financial markets. Sustained and wide-ranging reforms since 2004 had
reduced fiscal, monetary, and external vulnerabilities, and improved the investment climate.
These bolstered the economy’s durability and provided breathing space for appropriate
policy responses.


Financial market conditions have eased since the initial downturn. A sharp outflow
of capital took place in the second half of 2008, as foreign investors pulled out of equity
and government debt markets. Investors’ confidence in Egypt and appetite for risk have
improved since March 2009, and the stock market reversed course, capital inflows
resumed, and official international reserves have been rising.



Economic performance was better than expected, although headline inflation
remains elevated. Growth fell only to 4.7 percent in FY2008/09 on the strength of
consumption spending, and production in the construction, communications, and trade
sectors. The first half of FY2009/10 provides further evidence of a pickup in growth and
external demand. After falling rapidly from 24 percent, headline inflation has risen above
13 percent in recent months, although much of the impetus appears to be idiosyncratic.
Core inflation remains within the central bank’s informal comfort zone.

2.
Prompt fiscal and monetary responses helped cushion the impact of the postLehman slowdown. Additional infrastructure expenditures—some off-budget—provided a
targeted and temporary stimulus. Also helping to limit the slowdown, interest rates were cut
sharply. The rapid capital outflow in late 2008 was met mostly with a drawdown in official
reserves and the Central Bank of Egypt’s (CBE’s) foreign currency deposits with commercial
banks, limiting the impact on the Egyptian pound and real economy.
3.
As the recovery gains strength, the focus of policies can shift back toward
fiscal consolidation and other growth-oriented reforms. With growth expected to reach
5 percent in FY2009/10 and 5.5 percent in FY2010/11, the need for further stimulus is
waning.
Fiscal Policy
4.
The FY2009/10 budget is appropriately supportive, but budget execution
should give regard to the pace at which activity rebounds. The government’s
FY2009/10 fiscal deficit target of 8.4 percent of GDP is expected to be met on the strength
1

(http://www.imf.org/external/np/ms/2010/021610.htm).

of careful fiscal management. If revenues perform better than expected as a result of
strengthening activity, it would be prudent to save these. While the large government
borrowing requirement represents a potential risk, financing should be available without
undue stress. Development of markets for longer-term government debt is under way. The
authorities could also consider diversifying toward additional foreign financing. These steps
can help lengthen the average maturity of the debt, reduce financing costs, and lessen
pressures on the banking system to finance the budget.
5.
The authorities’ objective of reducing the fiscal deficit to about 3 percent by
FY2014/15 is critical to achieving private sector-led growth and reducing
vulnerabilities. Reducing the overall deficit by about 5 percent of GDP over the next five
years is feasible, based on the experience of other countries, and would lead to a further
15 percentage point decline in the debt-to-GDP ratio. Such adjustment will be crucial to
maintain investor confidence, preserve macroeconomic stability, and create scope for future
countercyclical fiscal policy. Anchoring the strategy in reforms to increase the low tax
revenue-to-GDP ratio and the efficiency of public spending will help durably address Egypt’s
main fiscal vulnerabilities. Priorities include adopting as early as possible a full-fledged VAT,
complementing energy subsidy reform with better-targeted transfers to the most needy, and
containing the fiscal cost of the pension and health reforms.
6.
Staff advises that the FY2010/11 budget target a narrowing of the deficit
compared to this year. A tightening of 1½2 percent of GDP would provide an upfront
signal to investors that progress toward the medium term objective is well under way,
encouraging a more rapid private sector response to boost FDI and growth. While adopting
major reforms could be challenging with the approaching elections—as evidenced by the
delays in the property tax—staff encourages the authorities to continue taking measures
such as strengthening tax compliance and reducing the cost of subsidy abuse, and also to
resist pressures for additional spending.
Monetary Policy
7.
While 12month inflation is expected to decline in the coming months, the CBE
should stand ready to tighten monetary conditions if inflation does not abate. As
inflation ceased declining and output growth picked up, the recent decisions to keep rates
stable were appropriate. Increases in headline inflation have been driven largely by fruit and
vegetable prices. Such pressures are likely to be mostly idiosyncratic and not demandinduced. But persistently high headline inflation risks generating inflationary momentum
through its effect on expectations. Bringing down inflation toward partner country levels
should remain a key objective for the coming years. Staff welcomes progress in
strengthening the monetary policy framework. The new core inflation measure and
publishing the planned monetary policy reports will allow a better understanding of the
CBE’s monetary policy decisions, and help improve its effectiveness.
8.
Capital inflows, if continued, will complicate monetary policymaking. As the
CBE has done in the past, sterilized intervention is the first option for hot money inflows,

5

although this is expensive and unlikely to be effective if inflows persist. The CBE should also
continue to allow greater exchange rate variability to limit one-way bets. Egypt’s real
effective exchange rate is estimated to be slightly more appreciated than equilibrium,
although these estimates are subject to uncertainties. The possibility that capital inflows
could exert longer-lasting pressures for real appreciation reinforces the need for fiscal
adjustment and productivity-enhancing reforms.
Reforms for Sustained Growth
9.
Continuing the reform momentum and reducing fiscal vulnerabilities remain
the key medium-term challenges. Rapid growth is crucial to tackling poverty and the high
level of unemployment. In this context, reinvigorating the structural reform agenda should
help raise productivity and reinforce Egypt’s competitiveness.


Prioritizing reforms that promote macroeconomic stability and improve the
investment climate will support the resumption of foreign direct investment. As
noted, the planned fiscal adjustment and tax reforms are an important element of
generating confidence, improving the business environment, and ensuring space for the
private sector. Resumption of privatization and development of public-private
partnerships (PPPs) will help mobilize private sector financing and know-how.
Contingent liabilities associated with PPPs, however, should be monitored closely.



Reinforcing financial soundness and promoting financial sector deepening will
help mobilize savings needed to finance private sector-led growth. The stability of
the financial sector during and since the crisis is a testament to reforms since 2004. Staff
supports the continuation of reform efforts with the CBE’s Phase II agenda. Introducing
Basel II standards and supporting financial sector development will help facilitate
intermediation of savings and increase private sector access to credit. Staff supports
plans to adopt additional prudential measures to contain vulnerabilities that will arise with
greater integration with the global economy and the introduction of new asset classes.
Close coordination between the new nonbank supervisory authority and CBE will be a
priority, and consideration should be given to introducing forward-looking risk
management and developing global standards on liquidity and leverage.



Strengthening data quality and transparency will help improve the policy debate
and business environment, and enhance Fund surveillance. The need for greater
transparency and higher frequency data was underscored by the global financial crisis,
and enhancements would help ensure that data availability is on par with other emerging
markets. In particular, there is a need for more robust CPI and GDP deflators, and for
publishing higher-frequency aggregate financial soundness indicators (as planned), and
encouraging banks to make available detailed performance and soundness indicators.

10.
It is expected that the next Article IV consultation will be held on the standard
12month cycle.

11.
Egypt made significant progress
in wide-ranging structural reforms that
accelerated after 2004. This spurred
rapid output growth—averaging 7 percent
a year during FY2005/06FY2007/08—
underpinned by foreign investment-driven
productivity gains and the favorable
external environment. Reforms also
reduced fiscal, monetary and external
vulnerabilities, leaving some room to
maneuver on macroeconomic policies in
the event of negative shocks.
12.
Egypt weathered the global
financial crisis relatively well. Financial
market pressures eased after the initial
outflow in late 2008/early 2009.
Following the Lehman shock, foreign
investors withdrew from Egypt’s equity
and government debt markets, with
foreign T-bill holdings declining by over
80 percent by April 2009.

The stock market decline continued
through February 2009, with losses
reaching 70 percent relative to the
April 2008 peak. Having recovered over
half these losses by November 2009,
equity prices have plateaued in recent
months, but withstood the initial Dubai
World fallout.
After peaking in late 2008, Egypt’s
sovereign and CDS spreads tightened
during 2009 and, in early 2010, remain
well below their pre-Lehman levels and,
on average, below other emerging
markets.

BOX I. SPILLOVERS OF THE GLOBAL CRISIS TO EGYPT
Declining export demand, remittances, and capital inflows are the principal channels through
which crises in advanced economies affect emerging market economies like Egypt. Using a
model capturing all three routes by the Generalized Method of Moments using quarterly data from
200209, staff estimated the spillovers of the recent global crisis to Egypt. “Spillovers” are defined as
the negative contribution of external factors—increased financial stress in advanced economies and
the slow-down in trading partner growth—to output growth after the Lehman shock. The external
demand channel is proxied by economic activity in trade partners, and the Fund’s financial stress
index (FSI, presented in Chapter 4 in Spring 2009 WEO) can help somewhat capture the latter two
channels.
While spillovers explain most of the declines in output growth in Egypt and other countries
with similar income levels, the estimated spillovers have been relatively smaller for Egypt.1
This appears to be due, in part, to:
Estimated Spillovers of the Global Crisis 1/
(Change in output growth, percentage points)

 relatively low private credit
growth in Egypt prior to the crisis
(partly reflecting banking sector
asset restructuring during

Resilient domestic consumption demand,
and production in the construction,
communications, and trade sectors,
helped sustain growth and the pick-up to
nearly 5 percent in the first half of
FY2009/10. The buoyancy of household
expenditures during the crisis may reflect
a more limited impact on permanent
income given confidence in Egypt’s strong
future growth prospects, and the relatively
low level of private credit to businesses
and households as a percentage of GDP.
15.
Fiscal policy helped cushion the
impact of the crisis.
The government reacted quickly by
providing a sizable fiscal stimulus in the
second half of FY2008/09, while
temporarily postponing key fiscal reforms.
The stimulus focused mainly on
accelerating investment projects (about
1 percent of GDP) and public-private
partnership (PPP) investments (1 percent
of GDP).2
With mid-year expectations of comfortably
overperforming the budget target by
0.7 percent of GDP, the government used
this space to implement the stimulus while
keeping the annual deficit in line with the
6.8 percent of GDP target.3

2

The first PPP project for a power plant was
awarded in July 2009. The government also
launched a tender invitation for a Build, Operate,
and Transfer contract for a wind farm for which
32 companies prequalified.

3

The FY2008/09 budget outturn includes one-off
transactions—both revenue and expenditure (each
about 3½ percent of GDP)—with public entities,
associated with the settlement of fuel subsidy and
pension arrears, and the corresponding revenues.

POLICY RESPONSES TO THE GLOBAL
FINANCIAL CRISIS
The Egyptian authorities responded swiftly to
cushion the impact of the global financial crisis
and emerging slowdown.
•

In FY2008/09, the government undertook
additional (mainly infrastructure)
expenditure of about 1 percent of GDP. In
FY2009/10 fiscal policy remains
supportive, with an expected widening of
the budget deficit by 1½ percentage points
of GDP.

•

In October 2008, the CBE reiterated the
100 percent guarantee of local bank
deposits to help maintain confidence, and
imposed reporting requirements on
overseas deposits and investment
balances to help monitor unexpected
movements in financial flows.

•

The CBE cut overnight deposit and
lending rates six times between February
and September 2009, by a cumulative 325
bps and 375 bps, respectively.

•

The authorities allowed some additional
nominal exchange rate flexibility, with the
pound depreciating by about 6 percent
between September 2008 and
March 2009, and subsequently
appreciating (with resumed capital inflows)
almost to its pre-crisis level.

10

The government also postponed key fiscal
reforms—introducing the property tax,
broadening the VAT, and phasing out
energy subsidies—although these were
not budgeted to have an impact in
FY2008/09.

The budget targets a wider deficit of

substantial projected cyclical fall in
revenue (particularly from trade and Suez
Canal traffic), as well as the impact of
wage increases adopted before the crisis
and higher post-crisis debt service costs.
The government is seeking parliamentary
approval for additional infrastructure
spending (0.8 percent of GDP) to be
carried out by the autonomous urban

categories, and core inflation remains in
single digits and inside the CBE’s comfort
zone.6 Accordingly, the CBE shifted to a
more neutral stance, keeping rates
unchanged in the past three Monetary
Policy Committee meetings.7
Real ex-post policy rates remain
negative—although close to zero—and
bank lending and deposit rates remained
largely unchanged despite cuts in policy
rates. Nevertheless, the growth of private
sector credit slowed substantially—falling
to 5 percent in FY2008/09 compared to
12½ percent in FY2007/08—driven largely
by weaker demand for credit, as exporters
faced lower external demand and
businesses deferred investment
expenditures. Liquidity remains ample,
with a loan to deposit ratio holding at
around 50 percent and substantial excess
reserves (despite having declined since
mid2008).
The CBE’s Phase I reforms (200408)—
strengthened supervision, restructuring
and consolidation, and a cleanup of
NPLs—reduced financial vulnerabilities.
Also, limited reliance on short-term
wholesale funding channels and relatively
traditional portfolios, allowed Egyptian
banks to sidestep many of the detrimental
effects of the crisis. While the financial
system remains stable, the CBE’s
Phase II reforms (200911) will implement
the Basel II framework, along with other

POST-CRISIS

Real GDP Growth Projections, 2006/072010/11
(Percent change, yoy)

19.
The near-term macroeconomic
outlook appears favorable.
Growth is projected to pick up further to
5 percent and 5.5 percent for FY2009/10
and FY2010/11, respectively), reflecting
the nascent recovery in global demand
and investment in Egypt, and continued
strength in household consumption.
Following recent declines in monthly
inflation, headline inflation should continue
to ease over the remainder of FY2009/10,
particularly in the absence of any
pronounced demand pressures, or further
supply shocks or regulated price
adjustments. This should narrow the
wedge with core inflation, which should
remain within the CBE’s comfort zone.
While the recovery in external demand
should help stabilize exports including
tourism, domestic demand driven imports
will likely keep the current account in
deficit (2.6 percent of GDP). The
continued, albeit gradual, resumption of
FDI and portfolio inflows should see
official reserves increase slightly over the
remainder of the fiscal year.
20.
As output growth picks up and
approaches potential growth, the need
for policy stimulus will wane.
Egypt’s potential growth is currently
estimated at around 56 percent (about
1 percentage point lower than pre-crisis),
reflecting the fallout from lower potential
output in advanced economies post-crisis
(Box II).

With growth continuing to surprise on the
upside, higher-than-expected inflation,
capital flows resuming, and the output
growth approaching potential, the
authorities will need to shift policy gears.
Rather than containing the negative
spillovers of the crisis, the focus of policy
should be addressing fiscal vulnerabilities
and structural rigidities, thus positioning
the economy to take advantage of the
global recovery and its position of
economic strength starting this year.

14

BOX II. POTENTIAL OUTPUT GROWTH IN EGYPT
The global crisis affects Egypt’s medium-term growth prospects through lower demand for
Egypt’s exports (goods and services) and tighter financing conditions for investment. The
latter slows capital accumulation and technology transfers associated with lower FDI inflows, and
results in lower labor productivity growth.
Estimated potential output derived from the univariate Kalman filter, assuming AR(2) process in the
output gap and a drift in potential output (to incorporate changes in potential output caused by
external factors),1 indicates;
 Potential output growth increased from below 5 percent before 2004 to over 6 percent in
FY2005/0607/08, reflecting increased productivity due to the economic reforms since 2004,
strong external demand, large private capital inflows, and a competitive real exchange rate after
the large devaluation in 2003;
 Potential output growth declined after the Lehman shock from over 6 percent to slightly
above 5 percent, in line with declines in potential output in advanced economies;
 The output gap—defined as the deviation of actual output from its potential level—
narrowed after its peak of about one percentage point in the middle of FY2007/08, reflecting
a decline in potential output growth after the Lehman shock; and

 The decline in potential growth in the near term reduces the level of potential output in the
near term, but not the medium term growth rate of potential. The slowdown in potential
output growth will reduce the output level by about 5 percentage points by 2014 (compared to
potential output growth during FY2005/0607/08), assuming that potential growth gradually
returns to 6 percent by 2014.

The FY2009/10 budget struck a
reasonable balance. Premature
withdrawal of the fiscal stimulus could
undermine the recovery. But the risks
posed by the high debt and fiscal
financing requirement, and better-thananticipated growth prospects, weaken the
case for further stimulus.

At this stage, saving any revenue overperformance (projected near 0.3 percent
of GDP)—together with renewing fiscal
reform efforts—would help manage the
appropriate pace of withdrawing the fiscal
stimulus and ameliorate the fiscal risks.
With higher spending on fuel subsidies
financed with transfers from the stateowned petroleum company, and lowerthan-budgeted spending on wages and
interest payments largely offsetting an
unanticipated fall in grants, it should be
feasible to contain the deficit to
8.1 percent of GDP.

The FY2010/11 budget should aim to
begin delivering substantive fiscal
adjustment—of about 1½2 percentage
points of GDP)—to help engender
confidence in the authorities’ commitment
to medium-term adjustment and help
provide the buffer for future shocks. The
budget, currently being prepared by the
authorities, is likely to target a smaller
adjustment, with a deficit in the order of
7.9 percent of GDP, as planned reforms
(including the real estate tax and VAT)
have been postponed until after the
presidential elections. Staff considers that,

even without major policy measures, the
deficit could be contained to 7.6 percent of
GDP. It will also be important to resist
pressures in the context of the
forthcoming elections, both on
expenditures or further delays of key fiscal
reforms.

16

23.
Changes in debt management
will also help reduce risks associated
with the large rollover requirement.
The substantial and rising short-term
rollover requirement (above 20 percent of
GDP) is a source of potential risk, should
Egypt’s financing conditions deteriorate.
Increasing the average maturity of
government debt issues is already under
way. Also, with Egypt’s relatively small
external debt ratio, seeking external
financing on favorable terms would help to
lower financing costs and lengthen
maturities, and reducing reliance on the
banking system could free resources for
the private sector.

THE AUTHORITIES’ VIEWS:
The authorities assured on the importance
of resuming fiscal consolidation in
FY2010/11 provided sustained stability and
improved growth prospects in the world
economy. The Ministry of Finance is
currently working on reducing the targeted
deficit ratio for next year below the 8.4
percent deficit target for FY2009/10, while
taking additional measures where possible
during the year, including by rationalizing
the consumption of subsidized butane. The
authorities highlighted the fact that the
debt-to-GDP ratio was successfully
maintained in midst of the global crisis and
despite the adoption of countercyclical
fiscal policy measures for two consecutive
fiscal years.

24.
Absent further declines in
inflation, the CBE may need to
consider raising policy rates to avoid
inflationary pressures becoming more
generalized.
The recent interruption in cuts to policy
rates was appropriate. As fruit and
vegetable prices, and movements in
regulated prices account for about twothirds of recent headline inflation, staff
considers that the CBE’s new core
inflation provides a better measure of
underlying inflationary pressures. This
suggests that events underlying recent
headline inflation have not yet spilled over
into more widespread inflationary
pressures. In this regard, the CBE should
continue to communicate to the public that
recent increases in headline inflation are
temporary. But given the uncertainty, and
that output growth is approaching
potential, further increases in policy
interest rates may prove necessary if
sustained high headline inflation begins to
fuel inflationary expectations.
25.
Further reductions in inflation
are needed over coming years to help
align Egypt with its trading partners.
The CBE’s inflation reports and informal
comfort zone are providing a guide for
expectations, although the exchange rate
will continue to play an important role in
expectations formation for some time to
come.

17

The higher level and variability of inflation
since 2004 (chart) attests to the
importance of moving to full inflation
targeting as fiscal pressures abate. In this
context, low and stable inflation should be
the primary objective of policy in the
coming years. This would also require
allowing more exchange rate flexibility and
full operational autonomy of the CBE.

Non-oil export performance has been impressive in recent years, gaining market share even as the
real exchange rate has appreciated, suggesting that reforms have helped productivity growth.
Moreover, survey-based competitiveness indicators suggest that, notwithstanding remaining
weaknesses, impediments have been reduced in recent years (also see paragraph 30).

18

26.
Continued capital inflows would
pose a challenge for monetary and
exchange rate policy.
Egypt’s attractive T-Bill yields have
encouraged a resumption of short-term
capital inflows, albeit less than in 2007
and 2008 (see chart on page 7). While
competitiveness is not yet a problem,
further real appreciation driven by short
term capital flows could weaken mediumterm growth prospects.8
Sterilized intervention—the main recourse
during the 200607 inflows—is an
appropriate response to short-term inflows
while they remain small and potentially
temporary. Maintaining exchange rate
flexibility will be an important element of
the response, to limit the perception of
one-way bets. If inflows are large and
sustained, then other options may need to
be considered, including assessing the
adequacy of prudential measures to deal
with associated risks. Fiscal consolidation,
by reducing interest rates, will help reduce
pressure for inflows over time.

8

The surge in capital inflows, from which Egypt
benefited during 200407, occurred at a time when
the REER was significantly undervalued following
the pound’s large devaluation in 2003. However, on
the tail of the strong appreciation in 2008 and to a
lesser extent in 2009, the current level of the REER
may not be as conducive to Egypt benefiting from
future capital inflows.

THE AUTHORITIES’ VIEWS:
The authorities are of the view that recent
price pressures were driven largely by
isolated events—including some related to
supply side rigidities—and inflation should
begin to trend down in the period ahead.
They emphasized that, in the past 612
months, these price shocks had not spilled
over into underlying inflation pressures.
Nevertheless, the CBE stands ready to
tighten monetary conditions should
generalized inflation pressures emerge.
The authorities expressed their
commitment to a flexible exchange rate
arrangement, pointing to the additional
flexibility observed in the wake of the crisis
and especially in the past six months. At
the same time, they underscored the
importance of protecting the economy from
excessive volatility, including if driven by
hot money inflows, and agreed with the
merits of sterilized intervention as a
temporary response.

A revitalized reform agenda should be
framed around two broad pillars:
addressing fiscal vulnerability and
ensuring macroeconomic stability to help
maintain confidence and prevent
imbalances; and broad-based structural
reforms to strengthen the economy’s
dynamism. Attracting more FDI and the
associated technology transfers, will boost
productivity and potential output growth,
allowing Egypt to realize higher growth
rates accommodating real appreciation
pressures that could undermine
competitiveness and be counterproductive.

28.
Resuming medium-term fiscal
consolidation is crucial to addressing
fiscal vulnerabilities and encouraging
private investment.
Fiscal vulnerabilities are Egypt’s main
macroeconomic risk. Gross public debt
remains high by emerging market
standards and fiscal financing
requirements have averaged around
25 percent of GDP in recent years. If the
current stimulus is not unwound,
sustained high fiscal deficits could add to
inflation, curtail the scope for future
countercyclical fiscal policy, increase
rollover risks, and put upward pressure on
financing costs and the real exchange
rate. Also, continued heavy reliance on
domestic bank financing could impede
financial sector development, raise the
cost of financial intermediation, and limit
private sector access to financing.

While staff would have preferred a more
front-loaded adjustment, the planned
5 percentage point of GDP reduction in
the budget sector deficit by FY2014/15
(three years later than envisaged precrisis), should reduce gross public debt
substantially to about 60 percent of GDP
(Appendix I).
Increased tax revenues (3 percentage
points of GDP) will be central to the
adjustment, supported by adopting a fullfledged VAT, modernizing the property
tax, and broadening the income tax base.
In this regard, peak of adjustment should
come in FY2012/13, with the full year
effect of the VAT, following its introduction
in late FY2011/12.

Ongoing energy subsidy reform (Box III)
would help reduce spending inefficiencies
and provide more room for spending on
priority social and infrastructure needs.
The government is also reforming the
pension and health systems10 with a view
to strengthening their long-term
sustainability and efficiency.
29.
While challenging, the mediumterm fiscal strategy seems feasible
especially based on international
experience with successful fiscal
adjustments (Box IV).
Feasibility hinges on the prompt
resumption of key reforms, and containing
the fiscal costs of pension and health
reforms as final design choices are made.
Given the relatively sizeable adjustment,
the intended gradual approach set in a
broader reform agenda should lend
credibility to the feasibility and durability of
the change in the direction of fiscal policy.
In this regard, reliance on tax revenueenhancing measures should help build
confidence.
Despite past efforts to rationalize fuel
subsidies, domestic fuel prices remain
well below international prices11 and
prices in selected neighboring countries
(Box III). Subsidy reforms should be a

and USAID) on the tax, pension and health reforms,
and the PPP program.

priority and, if done in conjunction with
adopting an automatic price adjustment
mechanism or price liberalization (Jordan
and Lebanon, respectively), their
credibility would be enhanced.
Reforming the fiscal framework could
reinforce confidence, foster wider buy-in,
and facilitate monitoring of the
consolidation process. These could
include: broadening the focus of fiscal
policy to incorporate economic authorities
conducting non-commercial operations
currently outside the budget coverage;
implementing a full-fledged medium-term
budget framework; and tightening
expenditure controls.

THE AUTHORITIES’ VIEWS:
Despite improvements in receipts of
several tax types as achieved by recent tax
reforms, the authorities acknowledge that
constraints are still posed by low tax
revenue-to GDP ratio for several other tax
types. In order to meet their objective of
reducing the overall budget deficit to about
3 percent of GDP, the authorities point to
the need for a balanced adjustment,
composed of further revenue and spending
measures. They look forward to
broadening the tax base, with the full
impact of adopting a full-fledged VAT
expected in FY2012/13, following its
planned submission and approval in late
2011. They also hope to resume the
reform of fuel subsidies in 2011, after crisis
impacts will have fully subsided.

11

During 2009, domestic fuel prices were 30 to
75 percent below international prices, with LPG the
most subsidized (75 percent below international
prices) and fuel oil and gasoline the least
subsidized (around 30 percent below international
prices).

The authorities stressed their commitment
to careful due diligence in the decision
making and monitoring process for PPPs,
with particular regard to containing
potential fiscal risks.

income households (almost twice as
much for low income households).
Restructuring energy subsidies has been a key objective of the government’s post2004
reforms. In addition to several ad-hoc domestic fuel prices adjustments since 2004, the government
launched in late 2007 a plan to bring energy prices close to actual costs by 2010. The plan entailed
an immediate increase in the energy prices for energy-intensive industries and a one-year grace
period for non-energy intensive industries. However, during late 2008 and in the context of the crisis,
the government extended this grace period until early 2010 and announced that the elimination of
fuel subsidies would be postponed to 2014. At the same time, the government announced a coupon
scheme to improve the targeting of the LPG subsidy.
Notwithstanding the restructuring efforts, products consumed by higher income families—
such as diesel and regular gasoline—remain highly subsidized. Successive ad-hoc increases in
domestic prices have fallen short of passing through international price increases and some prices
remain well below international prices and prices in selected neighboring countries.

BOX IV. SUCCESSFUL FISCAL ADJUSTMENTS AROUND THE WORLD: LESSONS FOR EGYPT
A rich literature identifies factors underlying successful fiscal adjustments.1 Several studies
have examined many episodes of fiscal consolidation undertaken by industrial, emerging market, and
developing countries over the past four decades, using statistical and econometric analyses as well
as case studies. “Fiscal adjustments” are usually defined as successive improvements of the
cyclically adjusted primary balance or the primary balance over 3 years and “successful adjustments”
as episodes associated with sustained improvements in the (cyclically adjusted) primary balance or
durable declines in public debt.
Six key lessons for Egypt emerge from the empirical evidence about successful fiscal
adjustments:
Lesson 1: Engaging in an ambitious medium term fiscal adjustment, which is less likely to be
reversed, may signal a government’s commitment to address fiscal problems and change the
direction of fiscal policy. Successful fiscal adjustments in Brazil, Ireland, Lebanon, Lithuania, Russia,
and South Africa in the late 1990s/early 2000s targeted fiscal deficit reductions between 611 percent
of GDP (Tsibouris et. al., 2006; Purfield, 2003).
Lesson 2: Adopting a gradual consolidation strategy, rather than sharp and short adjustments,
allows the introduction of higher quality and more durable measures with lower political resistance
and highlights the existence of lags between adoption and full impact of adjustment measures.
Successful adjustments in Finland, Sweden, and Spain during the late 1990s were carried out over
periods of up to a decade (Kumar et. al., 2007).
Lesson 3: Expanding the tax base to boost revenue through policy measures and improved tax
compliance helps enable long-lasting consolidations and address a key fiscal vulnerability of narrow
tax bases (prevalent in low income countries). Increases in VAT and excises accounted for a large
share of Ireland’s fiscal consolidation in the early 2000s (Kumar et. al., 2007).
Lesson 4: Relying on core current expenditure cuts—such as reducing the public sector wage bill
and inefficient transfers—raise credibility of a government’s ability to tackle key spending pressures
and address fiscal imbalances in a sustainable manner. Brazil’s successful adjustment in late 1990s
entailed reducing generous pension benefits and strengthening social safety nets (Tsibouris et.
al., 2006).
Lesson 5: Strengthening fiscal institutions—i.e., medium-term fiscal frameworks and effective
expenditure control—can provide a road map for consolidation and support implementation. Mediumterm fiscal policy frameworks were instrumental in Brazil, Lithuania, and New Zealand, and
strengthened expenditure management supported adjustment in Lebanon, Russia, and South Africa
(Tsibouris et. al., 2006).
Lesson 6: Fiscal consolidation, accompanied by a broader package of structural reforms will
boost credibility and sustainability given the need for political consensus and the more permanent
changes in revenue and spending triggered by reforms. Structural reforms both on revenue and
spending side played a key role in the consolidation strategies of several EU member states ahead of
the inception of the economic and monetary union (Larch et. al., 2008).

B. A More Competitive Economy
30.
Further improving the
investment and business environment
will be crucial to achieving a
competitive edge in the post-crisis
global economic environment.
The post-2004 reform agenda has begun
to pay dividends. The World Bank’s 2010
Doing Business report identifies Egypt as
among the top reformers, emphasizing
improvements in starting a business and
regulation, and access to credit. Also,
Egypt moved up 11 places in the World
Economic Forum’s 200910 Global
Competitiveness Report (GCR), reflecting
mainly “recent liberalization efforts”
including improvements in infrastructure.
However, its relative position still remains
at 70 (of 133 countries). The GCR
identified macroeconomic stability and
banking system solidity as key structural
impediments. Transparency International
cites accountability and transparency, and
weaknesses in the legal/regulatory system
as key reasons for Egypt remaining 111th
of 180 countries on its Corruption
Perception Index.
Decisive action to continue the earlier
reform momentum should focus on
addressing the remaining structural
weaknesses. In addition to sound
macroeconomic policies, efforts should
focus on:


Resuming privatization and increasing
the role of carefully structured and
appropriately priced PPPs should
assist fiscal adjustment and mobilize
private resources for infrastructure
investment. Shifting out of business

RISKS
The planned medium term fiscal consolidation
tackles the central fiscal vulnerabilities. While
the large domestic debt rollover requirement
(about 20 percent of GDP) remains a potential
risk, the banking system remains liquid.
However, slower implementation of key fiscal
reforms and adjustment path would delay the
reductions in debt and rollover requirements,
and could hinder the response of private
sector-led growth.
While PPPs can help mobilize private sector
financing and know-how for infrastructure
investment, these projects will need to be
carefully managed and structured to contain
risks, including limiting potential contingent
liabilities, within a sound institutional
framework as the one provided in the PPP law
that is now before Parliament.
Direct banking sector risks are well contained
following the banking reform. NPLs stood at
14.7 percent of total loans in September 2009,
virtually unchanged from before the crisis.
However, several potential risks—including
market concentration and the prospective use
of more sophisticated products—will require
careful watching to ensure sound financial
sector development, including the ability to
increase and effectively allocate private sector
credit, and diversify risks.

25

activities better suited to the private
sector should also help give greater
credibility to the government’s efforts
to instead focus on establishing a
sound legal and regulatory framework.


Reforms supported by the Bank,
including further improving the
financial sector and infrastructure, and
raising human capital.

31.
Continued financial sector
reforms are needed to help contain
risks, build investor confidence, and
support private sector-led growth.
Increasing financial competition, lowering
risk, and providing regulatory certainty will
make Egypt a more attractive destination
for investment, deepen markets, and
facilitate the access to capital needed to
support future growth.
Improving intermediation and competition
within the sector—not well developed
compared to other emerging markets
(private sector credit has averaged around
40 percent of GDP in the past 5 years)—is
needed to effectively and productively
channel resources to the private sector.
Over time, this will serve as an important
source of financing for private investment
to complement the current heavy reliance
on FDI and self-financing.
To this end, the CBE’s Phase I reforms
made considerable progress in increasing
the efficiency of, and reducing risks in, the
banking sector. By continuing with a
forward-looking approach to risk
assessment and other measures to limit
risk as the sector evolves (Box V),
Phase II reforms should further enhance
financial sector soundness and efficiency,
and its role in supporting growth.

THE AUTHORITIES’ VIEWS:
The authorities highlighted their successful
track record in implementing financial
sector reforms and their continued
commitment to Phase II reforms,
emphasizing the role of banking system
stability and access to financing in
promoting growth. They identified the
comprehensive implementation of Basel II
standards, along with some additional
prudential measures focused on risk
mitigation and capacity building, as key
pillars. They also expressed their intention
to publish in the coming year higher
frequency aggregate financial soundness
indicators and, over time, encourage banks
to make available detailed performance
and soundness indicators.

32.
Further improvements are
needed in the timeliness, coverage and
availability of economic and financial
statistics to complement other
improvements in Egypt’s macroeconomic
policy framework, and provide greater
policy accountability and regulatory
certainty. This is particularly important
given general concerns about data gaps
highlighted by the global financial crisis.
Despite advancements in Egypt’s data
availability (e.g., core inflation, publication
of the CBE’s reserve template on the
Fund’s website), weaknesses linger in
numerous areas (such as internal and
time consistency of GDP data, quality and
consistency of CPI and GDP deflators,
lack of coverage of off-budget fiscal
entities, lack of survey data for direct
investment), and limited high frequency
data across all sectors (e.g., retail sales
and real estate prices).

26

BOX V. FINANCIAL SECTOR REFORM PRIORITIES FOR EGYPT
Phase I of the CBE’s Financial Sector Reform Program (200408) has produced tangible
results, with most recommendations of the 2002 FSAP being implemented. The financial sector has
benefited, largely escaping the global financial crisis, and with increased investment by both local and
foreign market participants, particularly as new segments (mainly securities) become active.
 Comprehensive and coherent bank restructuring measures increased the efficiency of the
banking sector, and reduced vulnerabilities and balance sheet burdens. Most notably:


Enforcement of minimum capital requirements and other standards have reduced banks
operating in Egypt by 31 percent through forced and voluntary mergers.



The soundness of remaining state owned banks has been assessed in line with international
accounting standards. Functional and trained risk, information technology, and human
resources departments have been established at banks to mitigate future risk and
deterioration, and mandatory risk and performance reporting to the CBE is in full effect.



Significant resolution of non-performing loans has taken place and public sector entity debt
resolution is under way.

 The regulatory and supervisory framework has been transparently updated, with the stated
aim of promoting competitiveness, and reducing risks. For example:


Rules and regulations governing the financial sector are published regularly and clearly,
including efforts to align accounting, disclosure, reporting and measurement standards with
international codes.



The capacity of regulators and supervisors to address risks and transmission mechanisms is
being enhanced. For example, consolidation of regulatory and supervisory authority over nonbank entities, as well as the training for regulators and supervisors to qualitative and
quantitative techniques.

Building on these actions, Phase II reforms (200911) will further modernize prudential
oversight, spur competition, and support growth through increasing access to financing (a
key goal of Phase II). In addition to tackling the outstanding elements of Phase I and remaining 2007
FSAP update recommendations, the reform agenda should focus on a forward-looking approach to
assessing the evolution and scope of potential risks. In this regard, implementation of a
comprehensive Basel II framework is underway, along with prudential measures designed to limit
excessive risk build up within the financial sector. Staff considers that other priorities should include:
 reducing banking sector concentration through further privatization or significant balance sheet
reduction of state owned banks, with the goal of enhanced competition;
 increasing the detail, quality and frequency of publication of aggregate performance and
soundness indicators, and encouraging additional transparency banks’ reporting of key indicators
(e.g., level and composition of Tier 1 capital/risk weighted assets, non-performing assets ratios);
 increased and systematic coordination, and consistent risk methodologies, between the CBE
(bank supervision) and the new (nonbank) Egyptian Financial Supervisory Authority; and
 removing the remaining structural impediments to enhanced financial intermediation, while
developing safeguards to limit potential new risks (e.g., divergent risk assessments amongst
banks, emerging derivative-like structured products (particularly related to PPP financing)).

APPENDIX I. DEBT SUSTAINABILITY ANALYSIS
A. Public Debt12
Under current policies, Egypt’s gross public debt to GDP ratio is expected to remain
broadly unchanged at 73 percent of GDP by FY2014/15. This public debt to GDP ratio—
slightly lower than that recorded during the previous two years—is based on the FY2009/10
budget and assumes largely unchanged policies thereafter, involving primary deficits for the
general government and the budget sector as percent of GDP of about 3 percent and
2.3 percent, respectively, over the medium term.
However, Egypt’s gross public debt could decline by 15 percentage points to about
61 percent of GDP in FY2014/15, if the government adheres to its fiscal consolidation
strategy (baseline). The government’s consolidation strategy entails a reduction of
5 percent of GDP both in the general government and budget sector deficits over the next
five years, bringing them down to about 3.7 and 3.3 percent of GDP by FY2014/15. The
strategy also seeks to turn the general government and budget sector primary deficits into
surpluses of about 1.52 percent of GDP by FY2014/15.
If key assumptions are held over the next five years at their historical averages, the general
government primary deficit would be on average higher than the implied primary deficit in
the government’s consolidation strategy. Thus the decline in gross public debt would be
slightly more moderate to 62.4 percent of GDP by FY2014/15.
The debt outlook remains moderately vulnerable to adverse shocks. Standard bound
tests reveal the following (Figure I.1):

As a quarter of the debt is foreign currency denominated, a 30 percent real exchange
rate depreciation would increase the debt to GDP ratio by around 9 percentage points
relative to the baseline in FY2014/15.



With a contingent liabilities shock, the debt path would also increase throughout the
projection period, raising the gross public debt to GDP ratio by about 9 percentage
points above the baseline.



Even under smaller shocks—individual one-half standard deviation shocks to real
growth, interest rates, and the primary balance and a combined one-fourth standard

Public debt is defined as gross general government debt. Netting out the government deposits in the banking
system, the public debt is 62 percent of GDP, about 14 percent of GDP lower than the gross public debt.

deviation shock—the debt to GDP ratios would exceed the projections in the baseline
scenario by 58 percent over the projection period.
B. External Debt
External debt sustainability risks have been reduced substantially in recent years and
appear contained in the period ahead.


External debt almost halved from 32 percent of GDP in FY2004/05 to around 17 percent
in FY2008/09, reflecting in large part rapid nominal GDP growth.



Under the baseline scenario, external debt is projected to decline slightly to around
13 percent of GDP by FY2014/15.

The composition and small size of Egypt’s external debt makes it relatively resilient to
adverse external shocks.


External debt remains relatively low (at most around 22 percent of GDP in FY2014/15)
under the alternative scenario and each of the bound tests (Table I.2). For example, a
large depreciation or a persistent adverse shock to the current account would only raise
the projected path of external debt by 5 to 9 percentage points of GDP by FY2014/15.



Given the volatility of capital inflows to
emerging market economies during the
financial crisis and the importance of capital
inflows for Egypt in recent years, a
permanent one-half standard deviation
shock to non-debt creating capital inflows
was simulated. Even under this extreme
risk scenario, external debt is projected to
increase by only 8 percentage points of
GDP relative to the baseline (see figure).

1/ Public sector refers to gross general government debt.
2/ Derived as [(r - (1+g - g + (1+r]/(1+g++g)) times previous period debt ratio, with r = interest rate;  = growth rate of GDP deflator; g = real GDP growth rate;  = share of foreign-currency denominated debt;
and  = nominal exchange rate depreciation (measured by increase in local currency value of U.S. dollar).
3/ The real interest rate contribution is derived from the denominator in footnote 2/ as r - π (1+g) and the real growth contribution as -g.
4/ The exchange rate contribution is derived from the numerator in footnote 2/ as (1+r).
5/ For projections, this line includes exchange rate changes.
6/ Defined as public sector deficit, plus amortization of medium and long-term public sector debt, plus short-term debt at end of previous period.
7/ The key variables include real GDP growth; real interest rate; and primary balance in percent of GDP.
8/ Derived as nominal interest expenditure divided by previous period debt stock.
9/ Assumes that key variables (real GDP growth, real interest rate, and other identified debt-creating flows) remain at the level of the last projection year.

VII. Exchange Rate Arrangement (as of January 31, 2010):
Prior to January 29, 2003, the Egyptian pound was pegged to the dollar, with all foreign
exchange transactions taking place within a ±3 percent range around the central rate, which
was announced by the Central Bank of Egypt (CBE). Effective January 29, 2003, the
Egyptian pound was allowed to float. As a result, the exchange arrangement of Egypt was
reclassified to the category “managed float with no pre-announced path for the exchange
rate,” from the category “pegged exchange rate within horizontal bands.” In December 2004,
the CBE officially launched the foreign exchange interbank market with no controls on rates,
governed by a formal interbank convention on foreign exchange trading. The CBE stands
ready to purchase foreign exchange in the interbank market for banks to the extent they
exceed prudential limits on net open positions at the prevailing market rate. Effective
February 2, 2009, Egypt’s exchange rate was reclassified to other managed arrangement
from a managed float with no predetermined path for the exchange rate. Egypt maintains a
bilateral payment arrangement with Sudan which has been inoperative since the late 1990s.
Egypt maintains an exchange system free of restrictions on the making of payments and
transfers for current international transactions; however, Egypt has notified measures to the
Fund, pursuant to procedures under Executive Board Decision 144-(52/51), which apply to
measures imposed solely for national or international security reasons.
VIII. Article IV Consultation:
Consultations with Egypt are on a 12-month cycle. The last Article IV consultation
discussions were held in Cairo from October 22 to November 6, 2008. The staff report (CR
No. 09/25) was discussed by the Executive Board on December 22, 2008. The 2008
Article IV report and PIN were published on January 27, 2009.

ANNEX II. ARAB REPUBLIC OF EGYPT: RELATIONS WITH THE WORLD BANK
1.
Partnership for Development. In the FY2008–09 period, the government restated
its commitment to pursuing the implementation of its national development agenda against
the background of the current financial crisis. The national development agenda underpins
the World Bank Group (WBG) engagement strategy articulated in the Country Assistance
Strategy (CAS). Within the framework of this development agenda, the government decided
to increase its short-term focus on social policies and social services delivery, while
consolidating and deepening pro-growth reforms in a deteriorated global environment, so as
to ensure that the benefits of the recent economic performance are broadly shared. The
relationship between Egypt and the WBG has been transformed and markedly improved
over the last few years as a result of the progress Egypt has made in implementing reforms
and of the successful turnaround of the WBG program outlined in its FY2006−09 CAS. The
WBG has been providing its support through an integrated package of knowledge, advisory
services, technical assistance, and financing, in support of government priorities in given
sectors such as the financial sector, energy, transport, and education. During that CAS
period, the Bank and the government also collaborated on several pieces of analytical work
that led to both a better and a shared understanding in such areas investment climate and
financial sector, public expenditure, poverty, pensions and infrastructure. The government
has signaled its interest in a significant increase in IBRD lending, as part of its response to
the global crisis. The Bank is preparing for a year of even stronger delivery of IBRD lending,
and is working closely with the government to help design and implement further reforms
(including responding to the global crisis).
2.
World Bank Country Assistance Strategy. The current Bank assistance to Egypt
is anchored in a CAS initially for the period FY2006–09 which was extended to cover an
additional two fiscal years, until end-FY2011 in June 2008. In line with the government’s
development and reform agenda, the current CAS identified and implements interventions
that will (i) facilitate private sector development; (ii) enhance the provision of public services;
and (iii) promote equity.

3.
IMF-World Bank Collaboration in Specific Areas. The Bank and IMF continue to
collaborate in supporting the government in the areas of macroeconomic framework and
management; budget and public expenditure management; public sector reform; and private
and financial sector development.

World Bank/IDA Portfolio
4.
As of March 1, 2010, the Bank had approved 123 projects for Egypt (82 under IBRD
including two additional financing and 41 under IDA), valued at about US$10.3 billion, of
which about US$2 billion remain undisbursed. The current IBRD portfolio includes
16 projects with a total commitment of about US$2.4 billion. The sectoral composition of the
current portfolio (by value) is as follows: 67 percent for infrastructure, 14 percent for financial
and private sector development, 13 percent for agriculture and 6 percent for social sectors.
International Finance Corporation (IFC) Investments
5.
As of March 1, 2010 Egypt remains as one of the two largest exposure countries for
IFC in the MENA region with a total committed portfolio of US$643 million for 35 projects for
its own account. Its portfolio includes operations in the financial sector, export-oriented
manufacturing, ports, oil and gas, agribusiness, and healthcare. In March 2009 IFC
disbursed US$197 million for a 9.75 percent stake in the Bank of Alexandria (BoA). The
transaction represents IFC’s largest equity investment in Egypt (and the second largest
worldwide) and demonstrates its confidence in the Egyptian financial sector. IFC views BoA
as a flagship investment and will work with the World Bank to help make a strong platform to
implement important initiatives in scaling-up IFC’s engagement in priority areas such as
small and medium enterprises. IFC also has a large program of Advisory Services in Egypt,
focusing primarily on issues of financial sector development, investment climate

46

improvements, capacity building of SMEs, and public private partnerships in infrastructure,
health, and education.
Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency (MIGA) Exposures
6.
MIGA’s most important contribution to date has been to support and enable
investments by an Egyptian telecom company in two telecom projects in Pakistan and
Bangladesh, with a combined gross exposure of US$152 million—an example of SouthSouth investment. Requests for MIGA’s guarantees with Egypt as a host country are
relatively limited for now, since many bilateral agencies provide comparable services.

ANNEX III. ARAB REPUBLIC OF EGYPT: STATISTICAL ISSUES
1.
Data coverage and availability are broadly adequate for surveillance. However,
notwithstanding improvements in recent years, addressing the remaining shortcomings
would greatly enhance the effectiveness of surveillance. Priority areas for improvements are
price statistics, national accounts and external sector statistics. The global financial crisis
has also highlighted the importance of greater transparency and higher frequency data,
particularly for the financial sector. Egypt has subscribed to the Special Data Dissemination
Standard (SDDS), and an IMF Report on the Observance of Standards and Codes (ROSC),
based on an October 2003 mission assessing the quality of Egypt’s macroeconomic
statistics, was published in July 2005.
2.
National accounts: The National Accounts Department within the Ministry of
Economic Development compiles annual and quarterly national accounts data based on
the 1993 System of National Accounts (SNA 1993). Shortcomings, however, include:
inconsistency within the dataset (discrepancies between quarterly and annual GDP
estimates); inconsistency over time (the base year is often changed without an overlap with
the preceding base); inconsistency with balance of payments statistics; weakness in
inventory data (no negative inventory has been observed over 10 years); and the lack of
export and import price deflators. In addition, the October 2003 data ROSC identified
weaknesses in the source data (including limited use of surveys) and lack of an oversight
body to provide guidance on the quality of national accounts.
3.
Price statistics: The Central Agency for Public Mobilization and Statistics
(CAPMAS) disseminates a monthly producer price index, bi-monthly CPI data for all Egypt,
and monthly CPI data for eight geographic regions (Cairo, Alexandria, Upper Urban, Lower
Urban, Canal Cities, and Frontier; and every other month for Upper Rural, Lower Rural). The
CPI utilizes expenditure weights derived from a 2004−05 household expenditure survey,
although the household survey and detailed weights are not publicly available. In
October 2009, the Central Bank of Egypt (CBE) began releasing its measure of core
inflation, which excludes prices for the most volatile food items and regulated prices, and
issuing a monthly Inflation Note.
4.
Balance of payments statistics: The CBE compiles balance of payments statistics
based on the Balance of Payments Manual, Fifth Edition (BPM5). The 2003 data ROSC
mission noted that the robustness of balance of payments statistics are limited by: (i) source
data that do not reasonably approximate an accrual basis; (ii) unreliable merchandise trade
statistics from customs declarations compelling compilers to estimate using banks’ foreign
exchange records; (iii) limited coverage and classification of foreign exchange transactions:
and (iv) lack of survey data for direct investment enterprises. In 2009, the CBE commenced
publishing Egypt’s Reserve Template on the Fund’s website (having previously only been
published on the CBE’s website).
5.
Foreign direct investment: Since March 2005, a series of METAC missions to the
CBE and Ministry of Investment have provided advice on the measurement of FDI, and the
development of an FDI survey and business register. In a June/July 2009 mission, METAC
provided further technical assistance on improving the response rate and data quality of the

48

pilot FDI survey, and could consider additional assistance when the results of a full pilot FDI
survey are tabulated.
6.
External debt and the international investment position (IIP). Egypt reports IIP
data for publication in the International Financial Statistics (IFS) and Balance of Payments
Statistics Yearbook (BOPSY). A 2006 STA mission encouraged the authorities to address
gaps in the data, to connect stocks with flows and improve the reporting system on nonguaranteed debt. The authorities have not yet resolved these issues.
7.
Fiscal data: The authorities have largely adopted the classification of the
Government Finance Statistics Manual 2001 (GSFM 2001), with FAD and STA advice.
Nonetheless, the consolidation of general government operations (budget sector, National
Investment Bank, and Social Insurance Funds) under this new classification is incomplete
for “below-the-line” transactions. Annual government finance statistics based on
GFSM 2001 are reported for publication in the Government Finance Statistics Yearbook
(GFSY). Quarterly data on the budgetary central government are reported for publication in
the IFS. Currently, data on external and domestic debt are compiled by the CBE and
Ministry of Finance, respectively. More comprehensive coverage of government and
government-guaranteed debt data, within one debt database, could help further improve
debt management.
8.
Monetary and financial statistics: Monthly monetary and financial statistics are
comprehensive and generally reported within two months after the reference period. Egypt
reports monetary data to STA using the Standardized Report Forms (SRF) based on the
Monetary and Financial Statistics Manual. The coverage of data reported in the SRF form
needs to be expanded to include “other financial corporations.” The data ROSC mission
raised the issue of potential overstatement of foreign assets and foreign liabilities of the
banking sector, as recorded in the monetary statistics, because an offshore bank located in
Egypt is erroneously treated as a nonresident entity. The lack of comprehensive and regular
financial soundness indicators (FSIs) is problematic, with significant lags in some areas
(such as non-performing loans and provisioning). Improvements in this area should be given
a high priority given structural changes in the banking system and the importance of greater
transparency and higher frequency data underscored by the global financial crisis.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
April 14, 2010

International Monetary Fund
700 19th Street, NW
Washington, D. C. 20431 USA

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2010 Article IV Consultation with the
Arab Republic of Egypt
On March 24, 2010, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded
the Article IV consultation with Egypt.1
Background
Egypt made significant progress in wide-ranging structural reforms that accelerated after 2004.
This spurred rapid output growth—averaging 7 percent a year during FY2005/06FY2007/08—
underpinned by foreign investment-driven productivity gains and the favorable external
environment. Reforms also reduced fiscal, monetary and external vulnerabilities, leaving some
room to maneuver on macroeconomic policies in the event of negative shocks.
Egypt weathered the global financial crisis relatively well and financial market pressures eased
after the initial outflow. Equity prices plateaued in recent months, after having recovered over
half of the losses since the April 2008 peak. Egypt’s sovereign spreads tightened during 2009
and, in early 2010, remain well below their pre-Lehman levels. The temporary financial outflow
was met mostly with a drawdown in the central bank’s foreign currency deposits with
commercial banks, reversing the buildup in 200607 and limiting the impact on the Egyptian
pound and real economy. The authorities allowed some additional nominal exchange rate
flexibility, with the pound depreciating by about 6 percent between September 2008 and
March 2009, and subsequently appreciating (with resumed capital inflows) almost to its precrisis level.
1

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On
return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the
Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the
Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the
country's authorities. An explanation of any qualifiers used in summings up can be found here:
http://www.imf.org/external/np/sec/misc/qualifiers.htm.

2
The real economy held up relatively well in the face of weaker external demand. Although the
current account moved into deficit (2.4 percent of GDP in FY2008/09) as service receipts and
remittances declined, and investment and activity softened in exposed sectors, growth still
reached 4.7 percent in FY2008/09. Resilient domestic consumption demand, and production in
the construction, communications, and trade sectors, helped sustain growth and the pick-up to
nearly 5 percent in the first half of FY2009/10.
The government reacted quickly to the crisis by providing a sizable fiscal stimulus in the second
half of FY2008/09 based mainly on accelerating investment projects. Key fiscal reforms such as
introducing the property tax, broadening the Value Added Tax (VAT), and phasing out energy
subsidies were postponed. The FY2009/10 budget continues to support economic activity and
targets a wider deficit of 8.4 percent of GDP largely reflecting a substantial projected cyclical fall
in revenue (particularly from trade and Suez Canal traffic), as well as the impact of wage
increases adopted before the crisis and higher post-crisis debt service costs.
Reducing the fiscal deficit and public debt are key medium term objectives. Egypt’s public debt
remains high in comparison with many other emerging market countries. While much of the debt
is denominated in local currency, the maturity structure is short, creating an annual rollover
requirement of 20 percent of GDP. To address this vulnerability and help spur private sector-led
growth, the government has announced its intention to reduce the deficit to about 3 percent of
GDP by FY2014/15.
Supportive monetary policy helped resist crisis-related pressures. The Central Bank of Egypt
(CBE) cut policy rates six times between February and September 2009 as both headline and
core inflation declined rapidly to single digits by August 2009. The deceleration of inflation
stalled since October 2009, with headline inflation rising above 13 percent, mainly due to supply
shocks in several food categories. In the absence of demand pressures, the pick-up in headline
inflation has not become more widespread, and core inflation remains in single digits and inside
the CBE’s informal comfort zone. Accordingly, the CBE has kept rates unchanged in the past
three Monetary Policy Committee meetings.
The CBE’s Phase I banking reforms (200408)—strengthened supervision, restructuring and
consolidation, and a cleanup of NPLs—reduced financial vulnerabilities. Also, limited reliance
on short term wholesale funding channels and relatively traditional portfolios, allowed Egyptian
banks to sidestep many of the detrimental effects of the crisis. While the financial system
remains stable, the CBE’s Phase II reforms (200911) seeks to implement Basel II standards
and improve access to credit.
Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors agreed with the thrust of staff’s assessment. They commended the
authorities’ sound macroeconomic management and the reforms implemented since 2004,
which had strengthened the resilience of the Egyptian economy in the face of the global
financial crisis.

3
Directors praised the authorities’ policy responses to the crisis. The targeted fiscal stimulus and
successive cuts in interest rates helped cushion the impact of the global slowdown. Directors
observed that economic performance held up well, with growth falling less than in many other
emerging markets during 2008/09, and picking up further in recent quarters. Financial market
conditions have improved and some capital inflows have resumed since the initial downturn.
However, inflation remains elevated despite falling substantially from the peaks experienced in
2008.
As the recovery gains strength, Directors underscored the importance of shifting policies back
toward fiscal consolidation and other reforms. They supported the authorities’ objective of
reducing the fiscal deficit to about 3 percent by 2014/15, in light of the still high public debt and
large financing requirement. Directors encouraged the authorities to make a substantive step to
reduce the fiscal deficit at an early stage—to lessen vulnerability, boost confidence in the fiscal
adjustment strategy, and speed the response of private investment. Increasing the low tax
revenue-to-GDP ratio with a full-fledged VAT, and improving the efficiency of public spending by
reforming energy subsidies and pensions will be crucial to achieving the authorities’ fiscal
objectives. Directors saw merit in strengthening public debt management through lengthening
debt maturities and diversifying the debt structure.
Directors agreed with recent decisions to keep policy interest rates stable. However, if inflation
does not abate as expected, they encouraged the CBE to consider tightening monetary
conditions to prevent a buildup of inflationary momentum. They also saw further reductions in
inflation toward partner country levels as a key objective for the coming years. Directors noted
that continued short-term capital inflows could challenge monetary policy making, and
encouraged continued increases in exchange rate flexibility.
Directors agreed that continued broad-based reforms are needed to foster inclusive,
employment-generating growth. Priority reforms should focus on improving the investment
climate and raising productivity. Developing public-private partnerships can help mobilize
private sector financing and know-how, but associated contingent liabilities should be monitored
closely. Fiscal adjustment and productivity-enhancing reforms also will reduce the risk of real
exchange rate appreciation and help maintain competitiveness. Directors supported ongoing
financial sector reforms to help contain risks and improve private sector access to credit. They
encouraged forward-looking risk management and in this respect welcomed plans to introduce
Basel II standards.
Directors also pointed to the need to enhance data quality and availability to help improve the
policy debate and business environment.
Public Information Notices (PINs) form part of the IMF's efforts to promote transparency of the IMF's
views and analysis of economic developments and policies. With the consent of the country
(or countries) concerned, PINs are issued after Executive Board discussions of Article IV consultations
with member countries, of its surveillance of developments at the regional level, of post-program
monitoring, and of ex post assessments of member countries with longer-term program engagements.
PINs are also issued after Executive Board discussions of general policy matters, unless otherwise
decided by the Executive Board in a particular case. The staff report (use the free Adobe Acrobat
Reader to view this pdf file) for the 2010 Article IV Consultation with Egypt is also available.

Statement by Shakour Shaalan, Executive Director for Egypt
March 24, 2010
Background
1.
Reflecting steady implementation of wide-ranging reforms since 2004, Egypt’s economy
was well-positioned to withstand the global financial crisis and associated economic downturn.
In the years immediately prior to the crisis, macroeconomic reforms were aimed at reducing
fiscal and financial vulnerabilities, while far-reaching structural reforms substantially improved
the investment climate as highlighted in previous staff reports. Looking forward, the authorities
remain firmly committed to continue with fiscal and growth-promoting reforms to strengthen the
economy’s dynamism, boost productivity, and place the country on a strong footing in the postcrisis global environment.
Recent performance and policy response
2.
Crisis-related spillovers to Egypt were mild, particularly when compared with similar
countries, demonstrating the financial sector’s renewed resilience and the authorities’ swift
policy responses. Growth declined to 4.7 percent in 2008/09 from an average of 7 percent in the
previous three years. The magnitude of this decline, by 2½ percentage points, represented about
one half of the impact in comparable countries. Foreign direct investment flows continued albeit
at a slower rate, equity markets have rebounded and so far regained about half of their losses,
and the bout of capital outflows of late 2008 has since begun to reverse. Egypt’s diversified
export receipts (tourism, fertilizers, and clothing) were less sensitive to the downturn in global
economic activity, as shown in Box 1 of the staff report, reflecting a sound competitive edge.
Household demand also remained buoyant, attesting to public confidence in future growth
prospects and aided by a sizeable fiscal stimulus and supportive monetary policies. The fiscal
stimulus was focused on accelerating investment projects to lay the ground for further private
sector activity and postponing some tax measures, notably the VAT. Meanwhile, the Central
Bank of Egypt (CBE) reiterated its 100 percent deposit guarantee of local banks, cut overnight
rates six times by a over 300 cumulative basis points, and allowed the exchange rate to
depreciate by about 6 percent in the six months following the Lehman incident.
Outlook and medium term policies
3.
The authorities consider the key medium-term objective is to persist with reforms aimed
at solidifying macroeconomic stability while raising productivity and competitiveness of the
economy. Fiscal consolidation will continue to aim at strengthening the system’s sustainability,
controls, and efficiency. In addition to the ongoing fiscal adjustment, the aim is to further
develop infrastructure and boost private sector and foreign direct investment to raise employment
opportunities. Meanwhile further financial deepening is viewed as key to mobilize savings
needed to finance private sector-led growth. The authorities believe that continuation of such
policies may allow for a more rapid recovery in potential growth back to around 6 percent, well
ahead of 2014 as staff projects in Box II. It could also allow resumption of the upward trend in
potential growth that has occurred since the 2004 reforms (from around 3½ percent to around
6 percent within three years).

Fiscal Policy
4.
With vigilant monitoring and cautious fiscal management, the budget outcome is
expected to remain within the 2009/10 fiscal target of 8.4 percent of GDP, in spite of a
substantial drop in tax proceeds. As the global recovery takes firm hold, the authorities intend to
resume fiscal consolidation measures that were interrupted by the onset of the crisis. For the
remainder of this year and in 2010/11, options are being explored such as rationalizing the
consumption of subsidized butane, and bolstering tax administration to contain evasion. They
remain committed to containing the ratio of gross public debt to GDP, which has so far been held
in check to below pre-crisis levels.
5.
The authorities’ medium-term strategy of reducing the fiscal deficit to 3 percent of GDP
aims to maintain investor confidence, preserve macroeconomic stability and create fiscal scope
for future counter-cyclical policies. The strategy involves a balanced adjustment, encompassing
both revenue and spending measures. On the revenue side, the proposal for replacing the sales
tax by a comprehensive VAT is to be submitted to parliament in 2011, and further measures to
close loopholes in the income tax legislation are under consideration. On the expenditure side,
the reform of fuel subsidies will also be resumed as soon as the crisis has fully abated. Moreover,
the cabinet is discussing pension and health care reforms to improve efficiency and
sustainability.
Monetary and exchange rate policies
6.
The CBE has gradually strengthened the monetary policy framework and enhanced its
transparency. During the transition toward an eventual inflation-targeting regime, the central
bank meets its inflation objectives by steering the interest rate corridor, keeping in view
developments of monetary aggregates, as well as a host of other factors that may influence the
underlying rate of inflation. A core inflation index has been used by the central bank to
supplement the CPI published by the statistical authorities, and the public launching of the core
inflation index in October 2009 was well-received. Monetary policy notes will soon be published
to enhance the understanding of CBE’s monetary policy decisions and its effectiveness.
7.
Headline and core inflation declined in February 2010. After peaking at 23.7 percent in
August 2008, headline inflation declined to around 9 percent in August 2009, but subsequently
rose in October and remained elevated at above 13 percent until January 2010 due to a series of
one-off factors. These factors did not spill over to underlying inflation, as core inflation remained
subdued at around 7 percent throughout the period. The February 2010 CPI, released on
March 10 after issuance of the staff report, dropped to 12.8 percent, while core inflation declined
to 6.9 percent. The authorities expect inflation to continue to trend downward during the year,
but remain watchful of developments and start ready to adjust policies as needed to keep
inflationary expectations in check.
8.
The authorities view the current exchange regime as appropriately flexible, taking into
account market forces while avoiding disruptive fluctuations due to speculative forces. The
exchange rate depreciated by 6 percent in the few months following Lehman Brothers’ collapse,

3
and while it has since recovered, it fluctuates daily in response to market demand. Service and
remittance receipts are expected strengthen as the global recovery takes hold, reducing the
current account deficit to below the 2½ percent of GDP that emerged in 08/09. As staff rightly
points out, there is no evidence of competitiveness concerns and non-oil export performance has
been impressive. Once the temporary factors driving headline inflation have abated, price
developments are expected to become more aligned with trading partners, reversing the
temporary real appreciation, which in any case is relatively small and within the possible margin
of error in the calculations.
Financial sector reforms
9.
Building on the tangible results observed from Phase I financial sector reforms, the
authorities have now embarked on the Phase II agenda to further modernize prudential oversight
and facilitate intermediation and increase access to credit. As highlighted in Box V, a
comprehensive restructuring has forged a solid foundation for the Egyptian banking system.
Nonperforming loans have been significantly resolved, the supervisory framework has been
updated, and mandatory reporting of risk and performance is being enforced. A new Law
10/2009 was introduced to regulate the growing non-bank financial markets and instruments and
the Egyptian Financial Supervisory Authority was established to oversee the sector. Increased
competition among banks in retail banking activity will help improve access to credit, but the
authorities are under no illusion that this will be a rapid process. For example, compared to only
two banks offering mortgage finance in 2004/05, now 10 companies and 19 banks are offering
mortgages, the total value of which remains relatively small at less than 1 percent of GDP.
Other structural reforms
10.
The authorities intend to proceed with their broad-based structural reform agenda aimed
at attracting FDI, and boosting productivity, employment, and potential growth. Recent
improvements in infrastructure, as well as the regulatory framework and access to credit, have
propelled FDI from below $1 billion annually pre-2004 to $13 billion in 2007/08 (around
8 percent of GDP). A bill is before congress to launch a Public Private Partnership program,
under the auspices of the Ministry of Finance, aiming to attract private resources for
infrastructure investment with cautious pricing of risks, and while limiting contingent liabilities.
11.
The authorities thank the staff for a valuable and constructive exchange of views,
including during the useful presentations on selected issues of current policy relevance. They
also wish to express their appreciation for the continued provision of timely and effective
technical assistance and look forward to working together to further strengthen the statistical
framework.
