INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND
REPUBLIC OF CROATIA
Staff Report for the 2011 Article IV Consultation
Prepared by the European Department in Consultation with Other Departments
Approved by Juha Kähkönen and Claire Waysand
June 8, 2011
Background: Croatia’s recovery is lagging behind most other emerging economies in Europe. EU
accession negotiations are in final stages, but to fully utilize the benefits of EU membership, the
economy needs to be significantly revamped. Yet strong social opposition and upcoming parliamentary
elections to be held by early 2012 have constrained implementation of reforms.
Challenges: (i) Addressing deep-rooted structural rigidities and competitiveness problems to improve
medium-term growth prospects; (ii) reducing vulnerabilities arising from rapidly increasing public debt,
high external indebtedness, and balance sheet exposures to foreign currency risks; and (iii) mitigating
credit and funding risks in the banking sector.
Staff views: A consistent set of macroeconomic, structural, and financial sector policies is needed to
boost confidence and competitiveness, and create foundations for sustained economic growth. Priority
needs to be given to internal devaluation, in light of the stable exchange rate policy, through reduction
in wages and prices, comprehensive structural reforms, and an expenditure-based fiscal consolidation.
Structural reforms should focus on increasing labor market flexibility, reducing state participation in the
economy, and improving the business environment. Additional fiscal measures are needed to prevent a
rise in the deficit in 2011 and preserve market confidence. In the medium term, an expenditure-based
consolidation of about one percent of GDP annually is required to reverse the rise in the public debt.
Monetary policy should aim to gradually strengthen foreign exchange reserves, unless sustained
depreciation pressures occur, while continued strong regulatory and supervisory measures are needed to
contain risks in the banking sector.
Authorities’ views: The authorities broadly agreed with staff on the need to address structural
problems, and pointed out that the Economic Recovery Program outlined measures needed to tackle
these issues, and was being implemented. Some contingency measures have already been identified to
contain the 2011 budget deficit. The authorities see the need for substantial expenditure-based
consolidation over the medium term to ensure fiscal sustainability. The Croatian National Bank argued
that the reserve coverage was adequate, particularly when taking into account the commitment of
foreign banks to maintain their exposures, but agreed that the external position was vulnerable and saw
merit in higher buffers to fend off potential pressures. The authorities concurred with staff about risks to
the banking system, but pointed out that the sector is sufficiently resilient to withstand possible shocks.
Exchange rate. De jure managed float with no predetermined path; de facto crawl like arrangement
under the Fund’s classification. Croatia has accepted the obligations under Article VIII, Sections 2, 3,
and 4, and maintains an exchange system free of restrictions on payments and transfers for current
international transactions.

I. CONTEXT
1.
Against the backdrop of weak growth prospects and high vulnerabilities, the
Article IV discussions focused on the appropriate policy mix to improve the growth
outlook and enhance the resilience of the Croatian economy.1


Promoting recovery and sustainable medium-term growth. After a prolonged
downturn, growth prospects are mired by weak competitiveness and pervasive
structural rigidities. With a stable exchange rate policy, the challenge is to adjust
incomes and prices to more competitive levels, and to undertake comprehensive
structural reforms and an expenditure-based fiscal consolidation.



Reducing vulnerabilities and enhancing resilience to shocks. With significant
vulnerabilities arising from high external and foreign currency indebtedness and
deteriorating public finances, the challenge is to create space for macroeconomic
management by reversing the rise in public debt and building up foreign exchange
buffers.

2.
The upcoming accession of Croatia to the European Union (EU) presents a
tremendous opportunity. Croatia should use the intervening period to improve its
competitiveness that would facilitate FDI inflows and ultimately boost income convergence
to EU levels. Implementation of critical but socially-sensitive reforms is likely to be
influenced by a lack of consensus and the political environment, with general elections to be
held by early 2012.
II. BACKGROUND—ECONOMIC RECOVERY IS DELAYED
3.
Croatia’s recovery is lagging behind most other European countries (Figure 1
and Table 1). In 2010, investment plummeted due to low confidence, private consumption
was constrained by household deleveraging and falling employment, while inventories were
drawn down further. Exports rebounded strongly, but given their narrow base, were
insufficient to pull Croatia out of the recession. As a result, GDP declined by 1¼ percent
in 2010, and by 0.9 percent in first quarter of 2011.

1

The Article IV discussions took place in Zagreb during May 5-16, 2011. The mission team included
Ms. Murgašová (head), Mr. Darius and Ms. Rahman (all EUR), and Mr. Prokopenko (MCM). Mr. Lambregts
(Advisor to the Executive Director) joined the discussions. The mission met with Prime Minister Kosor,
Croatian National Bank Governor Rohatinski, Finance Minister Dalić, other senior officials, as well as
representatives of the Parliament, financial and business sectors, and trade unions.

5

4.
Economic slack has contained price and wage inflation (Figures 2 and 3).
Consistent with a large and widening negative output gap and a significant deterioration in
labor market conditions, core inflation and nominal wage growth remain subdued. However,
rising food and fuel prices have led to a rise in producer prices and headline inflation since
late 2010.
5.
The slight credit recovery was aided by official credit-support schemes and
accommodative monetary policy (Figure 4 and Table 2). With inflation contained, the
Croatian National Bank (CNB) maintained a high level of liquidity in the banking system,
part of which was channeled into credit-support schemes which helped reduce corporate
lending rates. Corporate lending grew faster than elsewhere in the region, but given that a
substantial portion of it was used to finance working capital or to refinance the existing loans,
it failed to boost economic activity.

6
6.
Implementation of structural reforms to address competitiveness problems has
been mixed. In early 2010, the government outlined comprehensive fiscal and structural
reforms in the Economic Recovery Program (ERP). These reforms aimed at promoting
recovery and creating a competitive economy, and were supported by staff in the 2010
Article IV consultation. Important progress was achieved in several areas. The pension law
was amended to gradually harmonize the retirement age between men and women at 65 years
by 2030, increase penalty for early retirement, and introduce incentives to delay retirement.
The unemployment law was changed to reduce benefits and duration. Judicial reforms were
instituted to strengten bankruptcy procedures for companies. Business registration procedures
were streamlined, and non-tax fees, which act as a deterrent to private investment, were
reduced by 25 percent. Yet implementation of other reforms, which are key to resolving
long-standing competitiveness problems, such as greater flexibility in wage setting
mechanisms, privatization, and reduction of public administration, has been hampered by
strong social resistance (Box 1).

7
Box 1: Croatia’s Competitiveness
Croatia has deep-rooted competitiveness problems (Figure 5). CGER based estimates suggest
that the real exchange rate is broadly in line
with equilibrium (Annex 1).Yet wages are
high compared to both income and
productivity levels (particularly as
aggregate productivity is likely to be
overestimated given the public sector’s
higher wages and large share in the
economy). In addition, there are substantial
non-price competitiveness weaknesses.
Government’s involvement in economic
activities in Croatia is greater than in many
of its peer European countries. Delays in
large-scale privatization and enterprise
restructuring have led to low competition
and relatively high state subsidies. Strict
labor regulations, combined with generous
social benefits, have kept labor force participation low. Despite recent improvements, many
aspects of business cost are several times higher than in regional peers, including due to
intrusive regulations and cumbersome fees imposed on the private sector. Croatia benefited
less than its peers from productivity enhancing greenfield FDI inflows into the tradable sector
during the pre crisis period. Consequently, Croatia’s export growth and penetration in the EU
market have been among the slowest in emerging Europe during the last decade.

8
7.
The authorities’ efforts did not prevent further fiscal deterioration in 2010
(Table 3). Despite substantial positive contributions from measures undertaken in 2009
and 2010, the general government’s deficit widened to 5 percent of GDP in 2010 on the back
of falling revenues. This was largely caused by declining profit and income taxes and social
contributions, as corporate profitability and employment plunged, and reduction in income
tax rates (contrary to staff’s previous advice) also contributed. Public debt reached 41 percent
of GDP.

8.
The authorities remain strongly committed to the stable exchange rate policy.
The broadly stable nominal exchange rate provided an anchor for inflation expectations and
financial stability, but also contributed to the accumulation of vulnerabilities. The stable
exchange rate regime reduced perceptions of risk and contributed to the overleveraging in
foreign currencies. This build-up of vulnerabilities acts as a constraint on exchange rate
policy.2
9.
Vulnerabilities remain high despite substantial external adjustment (Figures 6
and 7, Tables 4 and 5). Rising exports and a contraction in imports reduced the current
account deficit to about 1¼ percent of GDP in 2010 from just under 9 percent of GDP
in 2008. Capital inflows slowed down correspondingly due to excess capacity and weak
economic prospects. Nevertheless, with external debt at 100 percent of GDP, and foreign
currency gross indebtedness of the public and non-financial private sectors even larger,
balance sheet vulnerabilities are high (Box 2).

2

According to staff estimates, a 10 percent depreciation of the kuna would increase the net foreign currency
indebtedness of public and non-financial private sectors by 8 percent of GDP.

9
Box 2: Balance Sheet Vulnerabilities
Vulnerabilities were built up during the boom years of 2002–07, when large capital inflows were
channeled to the economy through the financial and corporate sectors, against the backdrop of a
stable exchange rate, high euroization, and pro-cyclical fiscal policies. Key sector-specific risks
include:


Public sector. A large debt stock constrains policy space. High financing needs expose
Croatia to adverse developments in international markets—if met externally—and to
potential crowding out—if met domestically. Exchange rate risk is significant, as two thirds
of the debt stock is held or linked to foreign currency.



Non-financial private sector. High indebtedness has held back economic recovery.
Households are deleveraging, and a downturn in investor sentiment could trigger corporate
sector’s deleveraging. Risks arise from foreign currency loans held by unhedged borrowers
in case of depreciation, and a rise in interest rates due to mostly variable-rate lending.



Financial sector. The sector’s dependence on foreign borrowing exposes it to roll-over and
contagion risks. In addition, it faces foreign currency induced credit risks.

Paper.

10.
The year 2010 brought no improvement in market confidence (Figure 8). After
recovering from the peak of the crisis, financial markets remained relatively stable. However,
confidence and equity prices have not begun to recover, real estate prices continued to fall,
and Croatia’s spreads have not improved over the past year as in most other emerging
markets in the region. S&P downgraded Croatia’s long-term sovereign credit to the lowest
investment grade in late 2010, in line with the other major rating agencies. The kuna
weakened during the second half of 2010, triggered by bank profit repatriation, and the CNB
used a mix of foreign exchange interventions and moral suasion to counter depreciation
pressures. Nonetheless, the government issued a ten-year Eurobond (2½ percent of GDP,
with a 340 bps spread over US treasury benchmark) in early 2011.
11.
The largely foreign-owned banking sector has weathered the economic
downturn relatively well (Figure 4 and Table 8). System-wide liquidity pressures have

10
abated, and the aggregate capital adequacy ratio (CAR) significantly exceeded the required
minimum of 12 percent at end-2010. Yet the recession eroded asset quality, with the overall
nonperforming loan (NPL) ratio reaching 11 percent and the corporate sector’s NPL ratio
18 percent in December 2010. While aggregate profitability indicators started to recover in
recent months, several small banks reported losses. One state-owned bank was recapitalized
using cash injections from the government’s supplementary budget (0.1 percent of GDP),
which was the method previously recommended by staff.
12.
The nonbank financial institutions are slowly recovering from the crisis. Pension
funds have managed to avoid a sharp downturn due to their conservative investment strategy.
Assets of investment funds have increased in 2010, but remain well below pre-crisis levels.
Insurance companies continue to struggle, partly reflecting a drop in motor vehicle sales.
Some consolidation among the nonbank financial institutions is currently under way.

III. MACROECONOMIC OUTLOOK AND RISKS
13.
Growth is expected to remain sluggish due to low confidence and weak
competitiveness (Table 6). Staff project GDP growth of 1 percent in 2011, mainly driven by
net exports. Domestic demand is expected to remain sluggish. Higher cost of living,
considerable labor market slack, and consumer deleveraging are likely to dampen
consumption growth, while fixed investment is projected to remain tepid in light of weak
confidence. The widening output gap is expected to contain core inflation, while headline
CPI inflation is projected to reach 3¼ percent due to increased commodity and food prices.
Without addressing the structural problems of the economy, GDP growth is expected to rise
to 3 percent by 2015 in line with a gradual recovery in domestic demand (Table 5), with the
output gap closing by then. The authorities broadly shared staff’s assessment of the outlook.

11
14.
External vulnerabilities will remain high due to large financing needs over the
medium term (Table 5). The current account deficit is expected to widen to 2¼ percent of
GDP in 2011, reflecting rising import volumes and prices. External financing requirements
are estimated to reach over 33 percent of GDP in 2011, highlighting dependence on rollover
of banking and corporate sector debt and a rebound in FDI. The CNB considered that the
Croatian economy remains vulnerable, but indicated that based on capital inflows so far this
year, the external rollover needs will

15.
Risks to the outlook are tilted to the downside. In the near term, downside risks
arise from high commodity prices. Absence of direct financial linkages and limited trade with
the euro periphery countries mitigate spillover risks, though Croatia is susceptible to
contagion through higher cost of funding. In light of the high financing requirements, a shift
in investor sentiment could trigger lower rollover of external debt and balance of payments
pressures. Upside risks include a more robust global growth, and success in attracting
investor interest for infrastructure projects recently announced by the government. Over the
medium term, the authorities anticipate that EU accession will boost growth. Staff pointed
out that this would require additional efforts to enhance Croatia’s absorptive capacity to
utilize EU funds.
IV. POLICY DISCUSSIONS—ADDRESSING THE MOUNTING CHALLENGES
Discussions focused on policies to increase competitiveness, facilitate fiscal consolidation,
boost reserves, and preserve financial sector stability. In the near term, staff recommended
an accommodative monetary policy and no further widening of the fiscal deficit, despite the
sizable output gap, due to limited policy space and the need to maintain market confidence.
A. Growth-Enhancing Structural Policies
16.
The authorities recognize the need to pursue growth-enhancing reforms. They
pointed out that the ERP outlined measures needed to tackle these issues and was being
implemented, but noted the lack of broad-based support for some reforms. Staff recognized

12
that notable progress was made in some areas, but argued that overall it has not been
sufficient to significantly improve Croatia’s economic prospects. Staff therefore urged
forceful implementation of the remaining key reforms. Priority should be given to: (i)
changing labor laws to induce a more competitive wage setting environment; and (ii)
reducing the size of public administration. Other critical actions include: (i) improving the
business environment through further reductions of entry and exit costs and of non-tax fees;
and (ii) completing privatization of companies with majority and minority government
stakes. Croatia’s broadly-stable exchange rate policy makes these reforms all the more
necessary to achieve adjustment of domestic wages and prices to more competitive levels.
Staff acknowledged that pursuing these reforms is challenging and could slow down growth
in the short term, but see them as necessary to reap maximum benefits from EU accession
and to boost medium-term growth. The authorities agreed with most of the priority actions,
and pointed to the recent modification of the civil service law and the modalities of
privatization as groundwork needed to move ahead in critical areas.
B. Developing a Credible Fiscal Consolidation Path
17.
The authorities and staff agreed that a substantial medium-term consolidation is
needed to ensure fiscal sustainability (Figure 9, Table 3, and Table 9). Measures
implemented so far are expected to yield savings of 2 percent of GDP cumulatively over the
medium term.3 In staff calculations, without further measures, the overall deficit of the
general government will remain sizable, gradually decreasing to 3½ percent of GDP by 2016,
with public debt reaching 54 percent GDP.4 In the long term, population aging is likely to add
further fiscal pressures through higher transfers to the health and pension sectors.5 Thus,
fiscal consolidation is necessary to create policy space, halt the rise in public debt,
accommodate ageing-related fiscal costs, and facilitate internal adjustment of the economy.

3

Staff’s baseline projections for 2012-16 incorporate savings from fiscal measures already in place: (i)
parametric changes in the pension system; (ii) hospital network rationalization and reduction of pharmaceuticals
costs; (iii) reduction of subsidies to the agriculture and railway sectors; and (iv) savings in social assistance
expenditures from implementation of the Personal Identification Number (PIN) and revisions in unemployment
benefits.

4

Debt Sustainability Analysis shows that public debt would exceed 60 percent under several stress scenarios
(Figure 4).

5

By 2050, the share of elderly population (65 years and above) is projected to increase to 27 percent from the
existing 17 percent. The pension and health sectors currently have deficits of 4.7 percent and 1.6 percent of
GDP, respectively, which together exceed the general government’s overall deficit.

budgeted payments for shipyards’ guarantees (Box 3)
and pre-election spending pressures could increase the deficit further. Public debt is projected
to rise to 47 percent of GDP (including assumed debt of shipyards)—a level considered high
for an emerging market.6 This heightens the risk of changes in market sentiment, which could
result in a sharp interest rate rise for the public and private sectors, or curtailment of
financing and BOP pressures. Therefore, staff recommend additional spending measures of
¾ percent of GDP to keep the deficit at its 2010 level, as a share of GDP and broadly on a
cyclically adjusted basis. This could be achieved by lower capital expenditures (which are
budgeted to increase by 32 percent in 2011) and continuing under-execution of expenditures
in other categories experienced during the first quarter. The authorities indicated that they
have identified some contingency measures, including dividends from public enterprises, to
contain the deficit.
6

Public sector’s financing needs at 15 percent of GDP this year are sizeable, but should be manageable
assuming full roll-over of domestic T-bills, and given ample liquidity in the banking system the recent issuance
of a Eurobond, and no more external payments falling due in 2011.

14
Box 3: Restructuring of Shipyards
Croatian shipbuilding industry, with around 1½ percent of the global market share, has been
heavily dependent on state aid. Shipyards have received subsidies (about ¼ percent of GDP per
year) as well as financial and performance guarantees which constitute contingent liabilities for
the government (the stock amounted to 3⅓ percent of GDP as of end-2010). A portion of the
guarantees have been regularly called in recent years, resulting in higher fiscal deficits. The
industry has been in decline since the beginning of transition due to loss of its traditional
markets and lack of structural reforms.
Successful privatization and restructuring of the shipyards constitutes a critical requirement to
close the competition chapter of EU accession negotiations. The restructuring plans for four of
the five major shipyards are currently under the consideration of the European Commission.
The restructuring will also require a resolution of the stock of guarantees. In staff’s baseline
projections, the government is expected to assume most (if not all) of these guarantees as
explicit debt.

19.
The authorities see the medium-term fiscal adjustment anchored in a new Fiscal
Responsibility Law (Figure 9). Staff welcomed the introduction of the FRL, but indicated
that the fiscal rule implied insufficient adjustment over the medium term. The FRL envisages
reduction in expenditures by 1 percent of GDP annually until a primary balance is reached
(Box 4). In staff’s view, this would keep debt elevated and would not create adequate policy
space. Staff therefore advocated that the pace of fiscal adjustment envisaged under the FRL
continue until an overall cyclically-adjusted balanced budget is achieved, likely by 2016. The
authorities indicated that they view expenditure reductions envisaged under the FRL as a
minimum and intend to halve the fiscal deficit between 2011 and 2013.

15
Box 4: The Fiscal Responsibility Law
Parliament adopted a Fiscal Responsibility Law (FRL) in November 2010, with the objective to
ensure fiscal responsibility, transparency, and sustainability of public finance. The fiscal rule
underlying the law aims to reduce expenditures as a share of GDP by no less than
one percentage point annually from 2011 until a primary balance is reached, and a cyclicallyadjusted primary fiscal balance would be targeted thereafter. The rule encompasses the general
budget, which includes the central government, extra-budgetary units, and the local and regional
self-government units. More recently, the authorities have established a Fiscal Policy Committee
to monitor implementation of the FRL. The committee, yet to become functional, is expected to
meet periodically and make its assessments of compliance with fiscal targets publicly available.
For a country like Croatia, where fiscal policy serves as the main macroeconomic policy tool
and public debt stock is relatively high, a fiscal rule has the dual purpose of output stabilization
and debt reduction. A rule that targets the primary balance risks maintaining public debt at too
high a level, servicing of which may come at a cost of reduced social or capital spending. Also,
it would not create enough policy space to make room for EU accession related expenditures and
expected rise in social expenditures from population ageing.
There are also some weaknesses in the reporting and sanctioning mechanisms which may
undermine effectiveness of the FRL. For example, while the FRL contains provisions about the
Ministry of Finance’s oversight over budget users, an issue usually tackled in standard public
financial management law, it does not cover the parliamentary oversight over the government’s
budget.

20.
Staff urged the authorities to identify and implement reform measures early to
make the FRL credible. Given that the
overall tax burden in Croatia is not low, tax
rates are high, and public expenditures have
numerous inefficiencies, staff and the
authorities agree that fiscal consolidation
should be pursued through expenditure
reductions.7 In addition, cross-country
experience shows that expenditure-based
fiscal consolidations tend to be more durable
than revenue-based consolidations. Staff
therefore proposed the following measures;
(i) reduction of public sector employment and
wages, and (ii) completing pending reforms in
7

Croatia’s tax rates (VAT at 23 percent, and income tax rates in the range of 12-40 percent) are among the
highest in the region. However, low labor force participation reduces overall tax collection.

16
pension, health, and social assistance expenditures. The authorities agreed with the need to
reduce public sector employment and social expenditure, but do not see the feasibility or the
need to reduce wage levels.
C. Building Buffers
21.
The authorities and staff agreed that the foreign currency buffers of the
economy should be maintained (Table 7). During the peak of the crisis in 2008–09 and
again in late 2010, the CNB resisted exchange rate depreciation through sales of foreign
exchange reserves and relaxation of foreign currency related prudential measures. Going
forward, staff see limited scope for the use of such measures given that official reserves are
relatively low, and large prudential foreign currency buffers, which were built up before the
crisis, have been significantly reduced.8 The CNB argued that the reserve coverage was
adequate, particularly when taking into account the commitment of foreign banks to maintain
their exposures, but concurred that the external position was fragile and saw merit in higher
buffers to fend off potential pressures.

8

Reserve coverage of short-term maturing liabilities (including equity and portfolio liabilities), a key indicator
for emerging market economies, of about 70 percent is below the accepted rule of thumb of at least 100 percent.
Reserve coverage of over 6 months of imports and about 100 percent of money supply (M1) appear adequate.
However, a weighted reserve metric tailored to a stable exchange rate regime which considers sources of
exchange rate pressure (including short-term debt, domestic assets, and export earnings) shows that Croatia is
below the minimum threshold.

17
22.
Staff recommended that the CNB should aim to gradually strengthen foreign
exchange reserves to counter risks from external vulnerabilities (Figure 9). One way to
achieve this in a transparent manner would be through small daily preannounced purchases
of foreign currency, unless sustained depreciation pressures occur. This would imply an
accommodative monetary policy, which is appropriate in the presence of a large output gap
and low core inflation. If inflationary pressures emerge, monetary policy will need to be
tightened. The CNB expressed concerns about changing the modalities for interventions, as
the current system (unannounced interventions in both directions) has been effective, and any
changes could undermine the credibility of the stable exchange rate policy and create
confidence problems in the banking sector. Nevertheless, the CNB pointed out that reserves
have already increased by about euro 670 million (between end-2010 and end-April 2011)
through the purchase of proceeds of the government euro bond.
D. Preserving Financial Sector Stability
23.
The CNB and staff concurred that the Croatian banking sector faces risks
(Table 8). The main risk arises from weak growth prospects and further deterioration in asset
quality which would put pressures on profitability and capitalization. Further weakening of
the kuna, including against the Swiss franc, poses another risk for asset quality, since close to
75 percent of loans are denominated in or linked to foreign currency (almost 16 percent of
which are linked to the Swiss franc). Staff recommend paying close attention to the
provisioning of NPLs, which has shown a declining trend in the last few years. There is also
liquidity risk related to significant dependence on parent banks for financing. While the
absence of subsidiaries with parents in debt-distressed Euro zone periphery reduces Croatia’s
exposure to contagion risks, dependence on external financing exposes local banks to thirdparty risks through higher funding costs or lower inflows.
24.
The authorities pointed out that the banking sector is sufficiently resilient to
withstand possible shocks. According to the CNB’s latest stress tests, profits of most banks
should be more than sufficient to fully absorb losses from an increase in the NPL ratio to
13 percent, with the remaining profits allowing banks to increase their capital adequacy rate
by 2 percentage points in the baseline scenario.9 Even in the event of scenario seen as highly
unlikely but plausible by the authorities, of more severe deterioration in credit quality
(arising from a 2 percent GDP contraction and a 10 percent depreciation of the kuna against
the euro), the CNB stress tests suggest that the system-wide capitalization ratio would remain
above the prudential minimum, with the exception of some smaller banks. Staff supports the
authorities’ intention to maintain sufficient capital buffers above the regulatory minimum.
Staff advised that if there is a need to recapitalize any of the state-owned banks, which are
small, this should be accompanied by comprehensive restructuring programs. With respect to
9

January 2011 Financial Stability Report of the CNB.

18
the liquidity risk, banks’ resilience would largely depend on parent banks maintaining open
credit lines, as experienced during the crisis.
25.
The CNB and staff agreed that systemic financial stability should continue to be
safeguarded through strong regulation and supervision. Staff welcomed the proactive
approach of the CNB to ensure effective bank regulation, and the CNB’s plans to gradually
introduce counter-cyclical capital buffers in the medium term, when the economic recovery
reaches a sustainable path. Both the CNB and HANFA (non-bank financial institutions
supervisor) were satisfied with the degree of supervisory cooperation, and the CNB also
indicated good level of cooperation with most home supervisors.
26.
Staff cautioned against certain official schemes which would increase contingent
liabilities of the public sector and undermine lending standards (Box 5). The scheme
involving the swap of debt of troubled private companies to the government into equity
should be limited only to corporates with viable restructuring plans. Staff recommended that
the scheme to subsidize mortgage interest payments should be temporary, and expressed
concerns that interest-payment guarantees on housing loans could lead to lowering of credit
standards. The authorities pointed out that this scheme was set up for one year and its overall
amount is very small.
Box 5: Credit Schemes
Croatia’s experience with credit stimulating schemes has been disappointing. Only about one
half of the amount (1.4 percent of GDP) allocated under the scheme to finance working
capital (Model A) was approved for disbursement in 2010, equivalent to 17 percent of the
increase in the stock of credit to private sector. There was essentially no demand for the
scheme to finance long-term investments (Model B). Only one small debt-to-equity swap was
approved (Model C).*
In early 2011, the authorities attempted to enhance the design of these schemes. The interest
rate on the subsidized portion of the loans (accounting for 40 percent) was reduced by
1 percentage point to 2.8 percent, and borrowers were allowed to refinance up to 40 percent
of their debt (instead of 20 percent). The maturity of lending under Model B was extended
from 10 to 15 years, and the fees for obtaining government guarantees were significantly
reduced.
The authorities also launched a new initiative to support the real estate market by subsidizing
first-time home buyers. Interest rate on such mortgages would not exceed 4.95 percent in the
first four year of loan repayments, and 5.5 percent in the following two years. Moreover, the
government will guarantee interest payments for one year in case the borrower loses job. The
total amount of fiscal subsidy allocated for this scheme is limited.
*Details of the schemes are provided in Annex III of the Staff Report for the 2010 Article IV
consultation.

19
27.
Staff cautioned against any potential tax changes of the financial sector that
could undermine its stability or endanger macroeconomic recovery. The introduction of
any additional taxation on the banking sector should be coordinated with the EU, and would
need to be carefully designed to avoid triggering capital outflows. Staff acknowledged that a
bank levy was currently not considered by the government, but noted that periodic
reemergence of talk on this issue created uncertainty about the banks’ operating environment.
V. STAFF APPRAISAL
28.
Croatia’s economy has yet to show signs of a sustained recovery. With continued
domestic demand contraction and a narrow export base, Croatia was unable to take full
advantage of the growth rebound in its trading partner countries. GDP therefore declined
further in 2010 and in the first quarter of 2011, and the recovery is lagging behind most other
European emerging market economies.
29.
Croatia faces major economic challenges. Structural impediments and weak
competitiveness hamper medium-term growth prospects, and large external and foreigncurrency debt as well as deteriorating public finances implies that vulnerabilities are high.
Without tackling these challenges, Croatia is likely to face a protracted period of low growth
and rising risks of balance of payments pressures.
30.
Comprehensive structural reforms need to be implemented expeditiously to
boost the growth potential of the economy. While progress has been made over the past
year in some areas of the government’s Economic Recovery Program (ERP), a critical mass
of reforms remains to be undertaken to revamp the economy and put it on a more sustainable
footing. In light of the stable exchange rate policy, priority needs to be given to internal
devaluation via reduction of prices and wages to more competitive levels. Structural reforms
should focus on making labor markets more flexible, increasing labor force participation,
reducing the size of public administration, privatizing minority and majority stakes in public
companies, and further improving the business climate.
31.
Fiscal consolidation is required to prevent deterioration of market confidence.
The adjustment process should commence in 2011, for example by curbing the rise in capital
spending, to avoid a further widening of the deficit. Delays could result in a change in
sentiment and a rise in interest rates for the public and private sectors, and potentially
detrimental consequences for growth and the balance of payments. In the medium term,
expenditure-based consolidation envisaged in the FRL should continue until the overall
budget is balanced, in order to create sufficient fiscal space and reduce public debt to safer
levels. The government needs to outline early on the measures underlying the fiscal targets,
to give the FRL credibility.
32.
Foreign currency buffers of the economy need to be enhanced to counter risks
arising from high external vulnerabilities. Room for further reducing official foreign
exchange reserves is limited due to relatively low reserve coverage, and additional relaxation

20
of prudential buffers would not be appropriate in light of the high degree of euroization in the
financial sector. Monetary policy should aim to gradually build up official reserves, unless
sustained depreciation pressures occur, and tightening will be needed if inflationary pressures
increase.
33.
Risks in the banking sector require continued strong regulatory and supervisory
measures. While the financial sector appears resilient due to significant capital and liquidity
buffers, it faces credit risks arising from weak growth prospects and liquidity risks due to
reliance on financing from parent banks. Continued monitoring and supervision and close
coordination with home supervisors will be needed to contain these risks.
34.
It is proposed that the next Article IV Consultation with Croatia be held at the
standard 12-month cycle.

2/ Liquid assets are on a net basis. They include deposits at banks and at the central bank, short-term government and central bank paper, and overnight loans extended; less
required reserve funds, central bank loans received, and overnight loans received. The sharp decline in liquidity in 2005 coincided with the start of reverse repo operations by the CNB
that gave banks market-based access to liquidity when needed.
3/ Commercial banks only. End-year FSIs, based on audited annual financial statements, can differ slightly from quarterly data.
4/ Includes kuna-denominated instruments linked to foreign currencies.
5/ Based on unconsolidated audited financial statements following IAS; not in line with the IMF FSI Compilation Guide.

1/ Gross debt of general government (including guarantees) and of monetary authorities.
2/ Derived as [(r - (1+g - g + (1+r]/(1+g++g)) times previous period debt ratio, with r = interest rate;  = growth rate of GDP deflator; g = real GDP growth rate;  = share of foreign-currency denominated debt; and e = nominal
exchange rate depreciation (measured by increase in local currency value of U.S. dollar).
3/ The real interest rate contribution is derived from the denominator in footnote 2/ as r - π (1+g) and the real growth contribution as -g.
4/ The exchange rate contribution is derived from the numerator in footnote 2/ as (1+r).
5/ For projections, this line includes exchange rate changes.
6/ Defined as public sector deficit, plus amortization of medium and long-term public sector debt, plus short-term debt at end of previous period.
7/ The key variables include real GDP growth; real interest rate; and primary balance in percent of GDP.
8/ Derived as nominal interest expenditure divided by previous period debt stock.
9/ Assumes that key variables (real GDP growth, real interest rate, and other identified debt-creating flows) remain at the level of the last projection year.

ANNEX I. ASSESSING CROATIA’S REAL EXCHANGE RATE
Staff’s quantitative estimates of misalignment suggest that Croatia’s real effective exchange
rate is broadly in line with equilibrium.


Macroeconomic balance approach suggests the kuna is broadly in line with
equilibrium.1 The underlying current account balance—proxied by the medium-term
projected current account deficit under an assumption of unchanged polices—is
estimated to be about 5.5 percent of GDP. Based on the Consultative Group on
Exchange Rate Issues (CGER) estimates of panel regression coefficients, the current
account deficit norm is estimated to be 4.6 percent of GDP. Upward adjustment of the
real effective exchange rate in the order of 1.0 percent would be required to close the
gap between the sustainable level of the current account balance and the underling
current account balance.



The external sustainability approach suggests that the kuna is undervalued assuming
stabilization of NFA at -90 percent of GDP.2 The gap between the underlying current
account and the NFA-stabilizing balance suggests that Croatia’s real effective
exchange rate is undervalued by 2 percent.

The macroeconomic balance approach tries to pinpoint an equilibrium relationship (the current account norm)
between the current account balance and a set of fundamentals using panel data.

2

The external sustainability approach focuses on the relationship between the sustainability of a country’s
external stock position and its flow current account position.

Exchange Rate Arrangement:
In December 1991, Croatia left the Yugoslav dinar area and adopted the Croatian
dinar as its sole legal tender. The Croatian dinar was replaced by the Croatian kuna on
May 30, 1994. The exchange rate of the kuna is determined by supply and demand in

3
the interbank market, with tight management by the CNB. Croatia’s de facto
exchange rate arrangement is classified as “crawl like arrangement” from
April 30, 2011. The CNB transacts only in euros, U.S. dollars, and SDRs. On
May 23, 2011 the official exchange rate was kuna 7.41564 per euro (middle rate).
VIII. Exchange Restrictions:
Croatia has accepted the obligations of Article VIII, Section 2–4 and maintains an
exchange system that is free of restrictions on payments and transfers for current
international transactions, except for restrictions that Croatia maintains solely for the
preservation of national or international security that have been notified to the Fund
pursuant to Executive Board Decision 144 (52/51).

Annex II. Croatia: Statistical Issues
1.
Data provision is broadly adequate for effective surveillance, though some
improvements would be desirable. While remedial action has been taken to improve data
coverage and reliability in most cases, progress in some instances has been impeded by
insufficient resources and issues regarding coordination among government agencies. Croatia
subscribes to the Special Data Dissemination Standard.
A. National Accounts
2.
The national accounts have undergone substantial improvements in the last few years.
The Central Bureau of Statistics (CBS) publishes constant and current price data compiled in
accordance with the 1995 ESA. Quarterly GDP estimates are disseminated at current prices
and at constant (2000) prices for the main categories of expenditure and main industry
groupings. Nonetheless, shortcomings remain. Significant discrepancies exist between
expenditure-based and value-added-based GDP data, stemming from: (i) problems of
coordination between the CBS and the Croatian National Bank (CNB) in reconciling tourism
receipts estimates; (ii) incomplete coverage of unincorporated businesses and the selfemployed (farmers, traders, and craftsmen); (iii) inadequate data for measuring changes in
inventories; (iv) incomplete coverage of the informal sector; and (v) a lack of quarterly data
for the seasonally volatile agricultural sector.
B. Prices
3.
The CBS produces a monthly consumer price index, with expenditure weights
(updated every five years) derived from a 2005 Household Budget Survey. Between
rebasing, the weights are price-updated annually to December of the previous year. Data are
collected at different time periods in the month for different product groups but in all cases
between the thirteenth and the twenty-first day of each month. The indices are released
around the fifteenth day of the following month. The price collection is confined to nine
towns, but the weights are based on a sample of households in the whole country. A
harmonized index of consumer prices (HICP) is also calculated in line with Eurostat
methodology, but is not released for the time being to avoid confusion. A core CPI is also
calculated based on a methodology developed by the CNB. The CBS also releases a monthly
producer price index (PPI), usually on the eighth day of the following month. The weighting
system of the PPI is based on the 2000 Annual Report of Industry and is changed every five
years, while weights are partially corrected every year.
C. Wages and Employment
4.
The CBS produces data on average net and gross earnings per person and
employment by sector. Earning data include bonuses, sick pay, and meal allowances, and are
based on monthly surveys covering 70 percent of workers in permanent employment in each

7
industrial category. They do not cover a significant part of the working population, including
persons employed in trade and crafts, contract workers, farmers, and the military and police.
5.
The number of registered unemployed overstates the actual level of unemployment. A
preliminary Labor Force Survey, which meets ILO standards, was conducted for the first
time in 1996 on 7,200 households. The sample was subsequently expanded and the survey is
now being conducted on a regular basis. The CBS released semi-annual results from 1998,
and began releasing quarterly results in 2007 with a lag of about four months.
D. Government Finance Statistics
6.
The authorities have started presenting budget plans based on the ESA 95 framework,
but government finance statistics produced on a monthly basis on the GFSM framework
(GFS) have been available in the Monthly Statistical Review of the Ministry of Finance
(MoF). Data normally come with a lag of about one quarter. Revenue data are reliable, and
expenditure data on a cash basis are available according to GFS classifications (economic
and functional) for the central budget and the budgetary funds. The data on central
government financing in the MoF reports are not reconciled with those in the CNB’s
monetary survey and balance of payments data, with substantial discrepancies owing partly
to different methodologies and definitions of government. Following the recommendations of
the October 2002 GFS mission, a task force, comprising staff from the MoF, CNB, and CBS
was formed to reconcile central government financing data produced by these institutions.
7.
The detailed data on domestic public bonds published in the Monthly Statistical
Review are now augmented by a central government debt table in the CNB Monthly Bulletin,
which also reports stocks of central government guaranteed debt. The MoF prepared a
database with government guarantees in July 2003 that has been used to monitor
developments in the stock and flows of guarantees.
8.
Data on the operations of local governments and consolidated general government are
available on a quarterly basis. Local government data are partial as they include the
operations of the 53 largest municipalities.
E. Monetary Data
9.
Compilation of monetary statistics published by the CNB is consistent with the
recommendations of the IMF’s 2000 Monetary and Financial Statistics Manual (MFSM).
Data on the monetary survey, including separate records for deposit money banks and the
balance sheet of the CNB, are published monthly with four- and two-week lags, respectively.
The CNB is planning to extend its statistical framework to balance sheet information of
investment funds and insurance companies. In March 2002, the CNB started collecting
financial information (balance sheets and investment structure) from investment and pension
funds; the data are not yet published, but used for internal purposes. According to the CNB,
the inclusion of other financial corporations in monetary statistics depends on the

8
harmonization process of the monetary statistics with the statistical reporting requirements of
the European Central Bank. In November 2006, the CNB reported monetary data in the
format of Standardized Report Forms for December 2001 to the present. These data accord
with the concepts and definitions in MFSM and were published, along with the corresponding
metadata, in IFS and the IFS Supplement on Monetary and Financial Statistics.
F. External Sector Statistics
10.
Quarterly balance of payments data are compiled broadly in accordance with the fifth
edition of the IMF’s Balance of Payments Manual. Data are generally available with a lag of
three months and are subject to substantial revisions in subsequent releases; trade data are
available with a lag of one month and data on international reserves are available the next
day on request. Travel survey methodologies were modified in 2002, 2004, and again
in 2005, while the method for estimating the cost of insurance and freight was modified in
early 2004. Net errors and omissions have ranged from 2½ to 3¾ percent of GDP since 2003,
and are negative. The coverage and quality of portfolio investment data are reasonably
complete and accurate.
A large part of external debt was contracted prior to the dissolution of the former
Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia and Croatia’s share was agreed with Paris and
London Club creditors in 1995 and 1998, respectively. The CNB compiles external debt data
according to the requirements of External Debt Statistics: Guide for Compilers and
Users, 2003, and began disseminating external debt data in the second quarter of 2003. The
inclusion of hybrid and subordinated debt instruments, repos, late interest, and interest
accruals and arrears has caused an upward adjustment in the external debt series compared to
previously released data. Quarterly data on the international investment position are available
on the CNB website up to 2010:Q4.

Annex III. Croatia: World Bank Relations
1.
The World Bank’s Board endorsed the Country Partnership Strategy (CPS) for
Croatia for FY09–12 in September 2008, just before the full onset of the global financial
crisis. The goal of the CPS is to support the completion of Croatia’s EU accession process,
the rapid convergence of its income level with that of current EU member states in a fiscally,
socially and environmentally sustainable fashion. This overarching goal is in line with the
Government’s priorities expressed in various government programs. In pursuing this goal,
the Bank Group program aims at contributing in the following four areas:





sustaining macroeconomic stability;
strengthening private sector-led growth and accelerating convergence with the EU;
improving the quality and efficiency in the social sectors; and
increasing the sustainability of long-term development.

2.
The EU accession agenda remains a cross-cutting theme in the design and
implementation of the Bank Group program. In the selection and design of operations,
primary consideration is given to the assessment of proposed projects’ support of Croatia’s
EU accession agenda. In the case of social sectors not covered under the EU acquis,
consideration is also given to how projects complement the EU accession efforts. Project
components that enhance Croatia’s capacity to absorb EU funds, especially following the
accession, have high priority.
3.
The CPS envisages an indicative base-case lending envelope of about US$1.0–
1.4 billion for investment operations over the four-year period. The CPS also includes an
upside scenario, with possible development policy lending amounting to some US$1.4–
1.8 billion. The lending program will be based on and complemented by analytical work,
particularly in the areas of public expenditure reform, governance, investment climate, and
climate change.
4.
In FY10, the Bank’s Board has approved three loans amounting to US$475 million,
to help mitigate the impact of the global economic crisis and provide funding for the private
sector, through a credit line of about EUR100 million for exporters, and through a Fiscal,
Social and Financial Sector Development Policy Loan of EUR200 million. In addition, an
investment operation for judicial sector has been approved. In FY11, the Bank’s Board
approved two loans amounting to USD242 million: (i) an Economic Recovery Development
Policy Loan of EUR150 million to support the authorities in implementing Economic
Recovery Program from April 2010 aiming to address the vulnerabilities and competitiveness
issues of the economy; and (ii) investment loan EU Natura 2000 Integration to support
adjustment to EU Species and Habitats Directives.

11
5.
Currently, the World Bank finances 15 operations in a wide range of sectors with a
net commitment of about US$1.3 billion. IFC’s portfolio amounts to about US$279 million,
and MIGA guarantees gross exposure amounts to US$649 million in the financial sector.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
July 1, 2011

International Monetary Fund
700 19th Street, NW
Washington, D. C. 20431 USA

IMF Executive Board Concludes the 2011 Article IV Consultation
with the Republic of Croatia
On June 24, 2011, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF)
concluded the Article IV consultation with Croatia.1
Background
Croatia’s economy has yet to show signs of a sustained recovery from the effects of the
economic crisis. Domestic demand continued to contract in 2010, as household
deleveraging and falling employment constrained private consumption, and low
confidence hampered investment. Exports rebounded strongly, but given the narrow
export base, were insufficient to pull Croatia out of the recession. Real GDP thus fell by
1¼ percent in 2010. The near-term outlook remains subdued, and growth is expected to
reach 1 percent in 2011, while medium-term growth is likely to be curtailed by weak
competitiveness.
The authorities made some progress in implementing the reforms outlined in the
government’s 2010 Economic Recovery Program (ERP), aimed at addressing deeprooted structural rigidities and competitiveness problems. The pension law was

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies.
On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion
by the Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as
Chairman of the Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is
transmitted to the country's authorities. An explanation of any qualifiers used in summings
up can be found here: http://www.imf.org/external/np/sec/misc/qualifiers.htm.

amended to gradually harmonize the retirement age between men and women at 65
years, and discourage early retirement. The unemployment law was changed to reduce
benefits and duration. Judicial reforms were instituted to strengthen bankruptcy
procedures for companies and business registration procedures were streamlined.
However, implementation of other reforms needed to improve competitiveness, such as
increasing labor market flexibility and reducing the size of the public sector, has been
hampered by strong social resistance.
The authorities’ efforts did not prevent fiscal deterioration in 2010. Despite substantial
positive contributions from measures undertaken in 2009 and 2010, the general
government’s deficit widened to 5 percent of GDP in 2010 on the back of falling
revenues. This was largely caused by declining profit and income taxes, and social
contributions, as corporate profitability and employment plunged. Public debt stock rose
to 41 percent of GDP.
External vulnerabilities remain elevated despite substantial adjustment in the current
account. Rising exports and a contraction in imports reduced the current account deficit
to about 1¼ percent of GDP in 2010 from just over 5 percent of GDP in 2009. Capital
inflows slowed down correspondingly due to excess capacity and weak economic
prospects. Yet external debt amounts to 100 percent of GDP, and foreign currency debt
of the public and non-financial private sector is even higher.
The largely foreign-owned banking sector has weathered the economic downturn
relatively well. The banking system has ample liquidity and is sufficiently capitalized.
Nevertheless, asset quality deteriorated, with the overall nonperforming loan (NPL) ratio
reaching 11 percent at end-2010. While aggregate profitability indicators started to
recover in recent months, several small banks reported losses. Credit growth to
corporates recovered somewhat, aided by official credit support schemes and
accommodative monetary policy.
Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors agreed with the thrust of the staff appraisal. They welcomed
Croatia’s progress towards EU accession. At the same time, Directors noted that its
narrow export base has prevented the country from taking full advantage of the growth
rebound in its trading partners, and that significant challenges remain to be addressed
to secure a sustained recovery. To improve the medium-term growth prospects of the
economy, Directors stressed the need to tackle structural rigidities and weak
competitiveness. Action is also needed to reduce the vulnerabilities arising from large
external and foreign-currency debt and deteriorating public finances.
Directors emphasized that the implementation of comprehensive reforms to restore
competitiveness and put the economy on a more sustainable footing is a priority. In light
of the stable exchange rate policy, Directors generally agreed on the need for internal

3
devaluation via reduction of prices and wages to more competitive levels. A few
Directors cautioned that such devaluation could weaken growth prospects, stressing
that it would need to be complemented by productivity-enhancing measures. Directors
welcomed the progress made in some areas of the government’s Economic Recovery
Program. However, a more decisive reform effort is needed, focusing on increasing
labor market flexibility and labor force participation, reducing the size of public
administration, privatization of public companies, and further improving the business
climate.
Directors stressed that the authorities should undertake substantial fiscal consolidation,
especially by identifying additional spending cuts, to preserve market confidence and
keep interest rates in check. For the medium term, they saw a need for continued
expenditure-based consolidation, as envisaged in the Fiscal Responsibility Law (FRL),
until an overall cyclically-adjusted balanced budget is achieved. This will create
sufficient fiscal space and ensure debt sustainability. To make the FRL more credible,
Directors encouraged the authorities to outline early on the measures underlying the
fiscal targets.
Executive Directors considered the current accommodative monetary policy to be
appropriate given the large output gap and low core inflation. While a few Directors
considered the reserves adequate, many noted Croatia’s relatively low reserve
coverage. Directors underscored the need for adequate buffers in light of the high
degree of euroization in the financial sector. They therefore generally agreed that
monetary policy should aim at gradually building up reserves in order to increase
Croatia’s resilience to external vulnerabilities, while exercising caution toward shifts in
market perception.
Directors noted that the financial sector appears resilient because of significant capital
and liquidity buffers. Nevertheless, challenges arise from weak growth prospects, rising
non-performing loans, and liquidity risks due to reliance on financing from parent banks.
Directors therefore called for continued strong regulatory and supervisory measures and
close coordination with home supervisors.

Statement by the Staff Representative on the Republic of Croatia
Executive Board Meeting
June 24, 2011
This statement provides information that has become available since the issuance of the
staff report (SM/11/114). The new information does not alter the thrust of the staff
appraisal.


On June 10, 2011 the European Commision proposed to the EU Council of
Ministers to close the final chapters in the accession negotiations with Croatia.
This outcome was broadly anticipated, and paves the way for Croatia’s EU
membership as of mid-2013 if the Commision’s recommendations are retained by the
Council.



The Croatian National Bank reduced the discount rate, but left the Lombard
rate, which sets the ceiling to the interest rate corridor on the money market,
unchanged. On June 8, 2011, the discount rate was reduced from 9 to 7 percent.
From July 1, 2011, this will result in a proportional reduction in the statutory default
rates, and a largely proportional reduction in the maximum contractual interest rates.
However, this change will have no direct impact on bank lending rates, as current
rates are below the maximum threshold.



The enhancements introduced in early 2011 to the official credit support scheme
(Model A) have accelerated its utilization (Box 5, SM/11/114). As of early June
2011, the total amount of funds originally allocated for this scheme of about 1.4
percent of GDP was approved for disbursement, and just over half was disbursed.



The government announced measures aimed at reducing the financial burden on
foreign currency borrowers. The government signed a memorandum on June 17,
2011, with representatives of eight banks to enable extension of loan maturities on
mortgages in Swiss francs, while taking into account regulatory and banks’ internal
procedures. At this point, staff is not in a position to make an assessment of the
possible impact on bank profitability and loan classification.



The parliament passed amendments to the labor law which allow for more
flexible working hours. Companies can now manage temporary changes in work
load without having to hire or fire extra workers.

Statement by Mr. Age Bakker, Executive Director for Croatia
June 24, 2011
General
The authorities continue to appreciate the close cooperation with the Fund. They valued the
frank discussions with staff on the 2011 Article IV Consultation. The authorities broadly
share the staff’s views in the report, although they would like to nuance some of the findings.
In line with their long-standing practice, the authorities consent to publication of the paper.
Economic Developments and Outlook
Since the 2008-09 crisis, the Croatian economy has been undergoing a painful but necessary
internal adjustment. GDP growth contracted in 2009 and 2010 as a result of a slump in
domestic demand. In the face of lower capital inflows, private sector balance sheets have
started to deleverage. Amid the growing negative output gap and rise in unemployment,
average nominal monthly wages declined and inflation came practically to a halt last year.
Due to a contraction in imports and increase in exports, the current account deficit reduced
sharply from almost 9 percent in 2008 to slightly more than 1 percent of GDP in 2010.
Given the ongoing internal devaluation, the authorities broadly share staff’s assessment of
the outlook. As regards the balance of risks to the outlook, the authorities agree that these are
tilted to the downside in the short run. Developments in the periphery of Europe could affect
Croatia through higher funding costs, but the impact has so far been relatively limited. Staff
argues that in light of high financing needs, a shift in investor sentiment could trigger lower
rollovers of external debt and BOP pressures. However, the authorities consider the
likelihood of such a scenario very small, given the intercompany nature of the debt inflows.
These inflows have proven to be very stable. Even at the peak of the global crisis, rollover
rates exceeded 100 percent. Based on the inflows so far, external rollover needs will almost
certainly be met in 2011.
Policies
The authorities have been working arduously towards EU accession, involving a wide range
of far-reaching reforms. These efforts have been rewarded, as the Commission recently
proposed to the EU Council of Ministers to close the last four chapters in the accession
negotiations with Croatia. This will pave the way for Croatia to join the EU as of 1 July
2013. While EU accession is expected to increase growth, partly through higher capital
investment, the authorities are fully aware that EU accession in itself will not lead to
miracles. They share staff’s view that through enhancing competitiveness and securing
macroeconomic policy space Croatia could obtain much larger benefits of EU accession.

2
Steadfast implementation of the Economic Recovery Program (ERP) and fiscal consolidation
will therefore be required going forward.
Monetary and Exchange Rate policies
The authorities remain strongly committed to the broadly stable exchange rate regime. This
policy has served the country well, by providing an anchor for inflation expectations and
financial stability in the context of high financial euroization. Staff argues that the exchange
rate regime has also contributed to overleveraging in foreign currency. According to the
authorities, exactly the opposite is true. In Croatia, foreign currency credit is mostly driven
by foreign currency deposits. Currency substitution was as high as 90 percent in the eighties
and early nineties; reflecting a protracted period of unstable exchange rate developments and
high inflation. Since the establishment of the actual exchange rate regime end-1993, liability
and thus asset euroization in banks’ balance sheets have actually decreased. This process was
only partly reversed since the crisis.
In view of the sizable foreign currency exposure of both the private and public sectors, the
authorities recognize that even moderate exchange rate depreciation would cause strong
negative balance sheet effects and credit losses. The broadly stable exchange rate regime is
also key to retain the country’s investment grade rating, as was recently stated by Moody’s.
In this regard, they agree with staff that exchange rate policy is constrained. At the same
time, the benefits in terms of improving competitiveness through a more flexible exchange
rate should not be exaggerated for a relatively small and open economy as Croatia. Even with
nominal exchange rate depreciation, competitiveness in the broader sense would be helped
only marginally, if the required real adjustments in fiscal policy and particularly labor and
product markets would lag behind. In the view of the authorities, the benefits of the current
regime therefore clearly outweigh the costs. The appropriateness of the regime was also
recognized by the Board last year.
Given the broadly stable exchange rate policy and the existing external vulnerabilities, the
authorities underscore the importance of having adequate foreign currency buffers. While
reserves are relatively low compared to many other emerging markets in relation to maturing
short-term liabilities, reserves are adequate in relation to imports and money supply.
Assessing reserve adequacy goes further than merely looking at a few metrics, or a weighted
metric, and requires taking into account country-specific circumstances, including the nature
of liabilities. Croatia’s short-term debt consists largely of intercompany bank debt and FDIrelated short-term liabilities that have proven to be less volatile than regular external bank
debt or portfolio investments.
That being said, the authorities see merit in gradually increasing reserves, as they have been
doing both before the crisis and again since 2010. However, the authorities see no merit in
the staff’s suggested intervention technique. In the authorities’ view, such an asymmetric pre-

3
announced intervention technique could lead markets to suspect that the authorities are
altering the exchange rate regime through the backdoor. Therefore the authorities fear it
could backfire on the goal of building up reserves.
Financial Sector policy
The banking system has weathered the downturn well, owing to conservative regulatory and
prudential policies. Despite the rise in nonperforming loans, the banking system remains
profitable and resilient, as illustrated by the report’s financial soundness indicators. Banking
profitability is likely to remain subdued amid weak growth prospects. However, stress tests
indicate that profits of most banks should be more than sufficient to fully absorb provisioning
costs arising from an increase in NPLs ratio to roughly 18 percent, which is highly unlikely
to materialize. Even in the event of a more severe worsening of asset quality, the systemwide capital adequacy ratio, currently almost 19 percent, would remain above the prudential
minimum. The authorities are of the view that the experience of the crisis has demonstrated
that the dependence of foreign parent banks turned out to be a factor mitigating liquidity
risks.
Fiscal policy
The authorities agree to the need of fiscal consolidation to facilitate further internal
adjustment, reduce debt, secure adequate policy space to address future economic shocks and
absorb a rise in ageing-related spending. They are fully aware that this consolidation should
be led by expenditure cuts in view of the high social security and tax rates. The authorities
also aim to step up efforts in tax collection.
Despite having taken measures of almost 2 percent of GDP over 2009–10, the fiscal deficit
has widened to 5 percent of GDP due to a slump in tax revenues. For this year, the authorities
are strongly committed to contain the deficit. Public wages and pensions will again be frozen
and subsidies reduced. In the event revenues fall short of what is expected, the authorities are
committed to take compensatory measures. Their ambition is to reduce the fiscal deficit to
around 2 percent of GDP by the end of 2013.
Guided by the recently established Fiscal Responsibility Law, the authorities will seek
further consolidation, particularly through savings in the areas of public administration and
social security. Rationalization of the public administration remains a priority for the
government. Headcount reduction is progressing, although slower than expected, and steps
have been taken that make the public work force more flexible. A new law is also being
prepared to make the public sector wage system more merit-based. With respect to social
security, the authorities have adopted several measures to curtail hospital and pharmaceutical
spending by introducing more co-payments. Pension laws were also amended to equalize the
retirement age between genders and a mix of penalties and incentives have been introduced

4
to discourage early retirement. The fiscal impact of these steps is expected to increase over
the medium to long run.
Wage and other structural policies
Croatia needs to boost competitiveness. While the real exchange rate is broadly in line with
fundamentals according to CGER, the country has lagged many of its regional peers in
gaining market share in the world’s good markets. Some progress was made in stimulating
labor market participation and flexibility. Benefits after 3 months of unemployment were
reduced, and the law on civil service employment was modified to allow for easier dismissal
of unsatisfactory workers. The authorities agree that wage setting needs to be made more
competitive. Equally important is to improve the business environment by reducing the
administrative and regulatory barriers to entry and exit of firms. In this context, non-tax fees
were cut by 25 percent. Yet there is more room for improvement. In September 2010 they
adopted an action plan for eliminating investment barriers, covering business registration,
issuance of permits and taxation. Amendments have also been made to the bankruptcy act,
allowing for more speedy procedures. The authorities agree to the need to reduce the state
involvement in the economy. Clear progress is being made to restructure and privatize the
country’s shipyards.
All in all, the authorities recognize that, going forward, implementation of the reforms agreed
in the context of EU accession and the ERP as well as further structural reforms are key to
increase competitiveness and potential growth in a sustainable manner.
