EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
The authorities are pursuing an ambitious reform agenda to address Mauritius’s loss of trade
preferences in textiles and sugar, its high fiscal deficit, and a secular decline in growth.
•

Macroeconomic prospects: Broad-based reforms have supported the recovery of GDP
growth. However, the recovery could be short-lived if the reform process flags.
Sustaining competitiveness will require success in reducing inflation and perhaps further
exchange rate adjustment.

•

Fiscal consolidation: The budget deficit target for 2006/07 (4 percent of GDP) is within
reach, although adjustment relies partly on lower capital expenditure. More decisive
fiscal consolidation and enhanced expenditure management are needed to reach the
medium-term budget deficit target of 3 percent of GDP, create more space for capital and
social expenditure, and improve debt sustainability.

•

Structural reforms: Structural reform could help lift growth to levels seen in the past two
decades. The staff encouraged the authorities to advance reforms that would increase
labor market flexibility, broaden trade liberalization, and extend access to finance. Some
price controls could be liberalized quickly.

•

Policy implementation: The authorities stressed that public support for reforms would be
a prerequisite for success. Donor support in the Aid for Trade initiative would facilitate
the implementation of accompanying measures.

4
I. THE CHALLENGES: REDUCING FISCAL VULNERABILITY AND REVITALIZING GROWTH
1.
Mauritius’s economy has
suffered setbacks after two decades
of remarkable growth. The loss of
trade preferences in textiles in 2005,
reform to the European Union’s
sugar protocol for 2006–10, and
higher international oil prices have
worsened Mauritius’s terms of trade.
Low growth and high fiscal deficits
have fueled growth in public debt,
and with slow adjustment in
consumption behavior, the current
account deficit and external
vulnerability have increased.

2.
The authorities have advanced several reforms initiated with the 2006/07 budget.
They have improved the business environment, moved towards fiscal consolidation,
simplified the tax system, eliminated some subsidies, liberalized trade, opened air access, and
advanced the restructuring of the economy and the development of new sectors. The Bank of
Mauritius (BoM) has replaced the Lombard rate with the repo rate as key policy rate.
Planned labor market reforms focus on more wage flexibility and reducing the cost of
releasing labor, supported by the empowerment program, which includes a workfare program
emphasizing training and reskilling.
3.
While there are signs of economic recovery, macroeconomic imbalances persist
(Figure 1). Strong growth in the service sector and slowing job losses in the textile sector
have helped revive real GDP growth. However, headline inflation surged largely reflecting
budgetary measures. Public debt remains high, and the current account deficit has widened
further, owing to weak export performance, higher oil prices, and lower import tariffs.1 The
BoM has continued intervening in the interbank foreign exchange market and has gradually
raised its signaling rate in response to higher inflation.

1

In 2005/06, errors and omissions accounted for more than half of the financing of the current account deficit.

II. POLICY DISCUSSIONS
4.
The authorities’ commitment to reform remains strong, but there is some
resistance within the governing coalition and among the general public. Trade-offs in
reform implementation arise between faster reform implementation and public acceptability,
and the sequencing of measures would need to be kept under review. Some early successes,
for example progress with the implementation of the empowerment program, would be
conducive to political acceptance. Staff acknowledged the importance of wide stakeholder
support but encouraged the authorities to put priority on (i) stepping up the fiscal effort in the
medium term, (ii) reforming the labor market, (iii) further liberalizing trade, and (iv)
pursuing additional structural reforms to promote growth.
5.
The streamlined Article IV consultations followed up on the findings in the
recent staff Letter of Assessment.2 The mission focused on macroeconomic prospects,
fiscal consolidation and public expenditure management, and selected structural reforms to
spur private sector development. Mauritius has been receptive to Fund advice, in particular in
fiscal and monetary policies.
A. Boosting Macroeconomic Prospects
6.
The growth recovery may prove short-lived, if reform efforts lose their
momentum. The staff’s baseline scenario projects real GDP growth of more than 4 percent
this fiscal year and in 2007/08, supported by strong growth in the service sector. In the
medium term, high public debt would crowd out private investment, pulling average real
GDP growth back to 3.5–4 percent. External adjustment would be slow. Assuming
continuing foreign exchange intervention and capital inflows near current levels, reserves
would dip to below three months of imports.
7.
The risks to the baseline outlook are balanced. A further decline in oil prices and
sustained growth in the service sector could restore external balance faster than projected,
boosting growth. Higher-than-expected fiscal deficits or a renewed surge in oil prices could
increase external vulnerability, leading to a larger current account deficit together with a
lower level of reserves, or requiring additional macroeconomic adjustment.
8.
Additional reforms would boost productivity and stimulate growth (Figure 2).
The mission’s accelerated reform scenario is in line with the experience of other emerging
markets (Figure 3). While it is difficult to identify specific policies that have caused growth
accelerations, in general, they have been export-led, supported by strong private sector
development and a reduction of infrastructure bottlenecks that hamper trade activities.

A growth acceleration is defined as a period in which the six-year trend growth rate of GDP per capita exceeded
3.5 percent, was at least 2 percentage points above the previous six-year period average, and real GDP per capita
exceeded the pre-acceleration peak. From a list of 25 emerging markets (excluding transition economies) from the
JP Morgan Emerging Market Bond Index, the staff identified 14 growth accelerations. For the methodology and
further references, see Funke, Harjes, and Leelapornchai (2006), South Africa: Selected Issues Paper, IMF.

Baseline versus Reform Scenario: Main Assumptions
Baseline Scenario
Reform scenario
• Reforms already implemented are
maintained

• Successful implementation of sector
strategies

• No labor market reform

• Fiscal consolidation to reach a budget
deficit of 3 percent of GDP

• No further trade liberalization

• Comprehensive labor market reform

• Continued foreign exchange intervention

• Monetary policy reform and foreign
exchange intervention limited to smoothing
excess volatility
• Broadening trade reform, price deregulation,
and financial sector reform

B. Monetary and Exchange Rate Policies
9.
Inflationary risks need to be monitored carefully (Figure 4). The staff and the
authorities agreed that it is important to reduce high headline inflation quickly to the
medium-term target of 4.5–5 percent, given the risk of entrenched inflation expectations. The
staff argued that the BoM should consider raising the repo rate, if signs emerge that headline
inflation would not decline as the one-time effects of budgetary measures start dropping out
in mid-2007. Staff emphasized the need to develop the institutional framework (including
research on transmission mechanisms of monetary policy and improving communication
with the public) in order to establish the repo rate as an effective policy rate.
10.
The staff argued that sustaining competitiveness may require further
adjustment in the exchange rate, in addition to wage restraint and productivity gains.
According to staff estimates, fundamental factors, most notably the decline in the terms of
trade, have lowered the equilibrium real effective exchange rate. Staff noted that the real
effective exchange rate may be somewhat above its estimated long-run equilibrium value,
and further adjustment may be required if the additional expected terms of trade decline
materializes. Intervention should be limited to smoothing excess volatility to avoid
postponing adjustment. In this context, staff also noted the sharp interest rate increase in
treasury bills at primary auctions. The authorities raised concerns about the pass-through of
exchange rate depreciations on inflation and suggested that the economic reforms could in
time promote stronger capital inflows, causing the exchange rate to appreciate. They
attributed the rise in treasury bill rates to institutional weaknesses, including the small
number of market participants.

C. Fiscal Policy
11.
The fiscal deficit (on a cash basis) is estimated to be close to the budgeted
target for 2006/07, but the adjustment mix is unfavorable.3 Staff estimates that sweeping
tax changes, together with reduced import tariffs, will have a slightly negative effect on
revenues (0.5 percent of GDP less than in 2005/06). Compared to the budget, delays in filling
vacancies have curbed expenditure on wages and salaries, but higher-than-expected inflation
has increased spending

12.
Additional fiscal efforts are needed to reduce the budget deficit in the medium
term and to improve the expenditure mix (Figure 5, Figure 6, Box 1). Around 4-5 percent
of GDP are needed to achieve the medium-term budget deficit target of 3 percent of GDP,
while increasing capital expenditure by 1 percent of GDP, and compensating for revenue loss
from further trade reform. While the authorities agreed on the need for further fiscal
consolidation, they have not committed to specific options as some measures, including
eliminating VAT exemptions and pension targeting, are politically sensitive. The authorities
pointed to the political trade-off between reorienting productive expenditure to improve the
quality of the budget and further deficit reductions. Their plans to strengthen debt
management will reduce fiscal vulnerability stemming from high interest payments and
refinancing risks. Under staff’s reform scenario, public debt sustainability would improve
(Appendix Table 9, Figure 10).
13.
The mission encouraged the authorities to reduce the financial risks of
Mauritius’s largest public enterprises, improve their efficiency, and review
opportunities to involve the private sector. Most parastatals have borrowed in foreign
currency, largely unhedged. These contingent liabilities could be reduced with improved
monitoring and clear policy guidance from the debt unit of the Ministry of Finance.
3

Accounting for interest payments on an accrual basis, which staff encouraged the authorities to do in the
future, the deficit is estimated to have been about 0.4 percentage points higher in 2005/06 but close to the cash
deficit in 2006/07.

1/ Based on a 2006 technical assistance mission and updated policy discussions.

14.
The authorities and the mission agreed that further prioritizing spending
(including reorientation to social functions) and enhancing expenditure management
are key to improving the quality of expenditure. The mission supported the authorities’
intention to extend the three-year rolling Medium Term Expenditure Framework (MTEF) to
all ministries in the 2007/08 budget and to improve budget monitoring, and macromodelling
capacity within the MTEF. The mission emphasized the importance of reallocating fiscal
resources (e.g., to education, well-targeted social programs, and infrastructure) within the

15
context of the overall reform agenda. The authorities highlighted the need to advance the
training and reskilling initiatives.
D. Private Sector Development
Trade Reform
15.
Recent progress in liberalizing trade is commendable and should foster
Mauritius’s growth prospects (Figure 7). The authorities stressed that progress has also
been made in reducing tariffs in sectors considered sensitive. However, as a small island
economy, it would be relatively difficult to establish the necessary trade infrastructure (e.g.,
antidumping laws) and competition policies needed to liberalize trade in all sectors. The
mission encouraged the authorities to aim for a simple and transparent tariff framework with
low, uniform rates instead of a duty free island with multiple exceptions. In promoting Aid

The financial system appears generally sound, however, more institutional
improvements could help lower borrowing costs and make more financing available to
small and medium-sized enterprises (Figure 8). Private sector credit as a share of GDP has
started recovering with recent reforms: the authorities unified banking licenses in 2004;
established a Credit Bureau in 2005; and developed a range of financing schemes with
preferential interest rates under the empowerment program. The authorities reaffirmed their
commitment to follow up on the proposals of the FSAP update (Box 2).4

A full AML/CFT assessment is scheduled for September 2007.

The mission recommended that the authorities:
•

consider the benefits and costs of the differential tax treatment for non-resident and
domestic lending, taking into account the impact on borrowing costs, economic
activity, the financial sector, and tax revenue;

•

explore opportunities for more closely involving market intermediaries in selecting
and monitoring the risk of projects financed by the Mauritius Development Bank;

•

address institutional constraints by expanding the scope of the Credit Bureau to
reduce asymmetric information between banks and potential borrowers, and by
strengthening creditors’ rights.
Box 2. Summary of Selected FSAP-Update Recommendations

Regulatory Agencies
• Improve cooperation between BoM and Financial Services Commission by activating
the December 2002 memorandum of understanding.*
• Strengthen the effectiveness of regulatory agencies by filling vacant positions.*
• Adopt manpower plans for both BoM and Financial Services Commission, emphasize
training and capacity building.
Insurance and Pensions
• Complete implementing regulations, including risk-based solvency rules, and proclaim
the Insurance Act 2005.*
• Finalize new private occupational pension bill and take steps to enact it.*
• Activate National Pension Fund Investment Committee.
Securities Markets
• Complete implementing regulations and proclaim the Securities Act 2005.*
• Adopt measures to develop more efficient money and government debt markets,
focusing explicitly on enhancing the efficiency of the primary market.
Money and Public Debt Markets
• Constitute Monetary Policy Committee (envisaged for April).
• Review money market operations and consider potential refinements.
• Finalize public debt management strategy and take measures to enhance the
transparency and efficiency of the primary market.*

Price Controls
17.
Still widespread administered prices are likely to hinder private sector
development. The staff suggested the authorities systematically review the rationale for
using administered prices, with a view to deregulate prices. This review should include an
assessment of the largest public enterprises, such as the State Trading Corporation. The
authorities explained that historically prices were administered to protect vulnerable groups,
limit monopoly power, and to protect local production. They shared staff’s assessment that

III. STAFF APPRAISAL
18.
Ambitious, broad-based reforms initiated with the 2006/07 budget are starting
to bear fruit, though macroeconomic challenges persist. Recent reforms have revived
GDP growth and boosted short-term growth prospects. The fiscal deficit (on a cash basis) is
projected to fall to near the budget target of 4 percent of GDP. However, headline inflation
has risen, largely reflecting budgetary measures and could raise the risk of entrenched
inflation expectations. External vulnerability remains high.
19.
The restoration of external balance will need to be supported by gains in
competitiveness. Success in reducing headline inflation (supported by improvements in the
monetary policy framework), wage restraint, and gains in productivity will be key. The
depreciation of the exchange rate has helped Mauritius adjust to the permanent terms of trade
shock. It should be allowed to move more freely to a level commensurate with the external
environment and to stabilize international reserves.
20.
Fiscal pressures in the medium term will require more decisive fiscal
consolidation and full implementation of reform projects under way. Budgetary savings
of about 4-5 percent of GDP would be needed to reach the medium-term budget deficit target
of about 3 percent of GDP, create more space for capital and social spending, compensate for
the loss in revenue from further trade liberalization, and improve debt sustainability. The
MTEF being rolled out to selected line ministries and the debt management unit being
established—important institutional improvements—will need to be extended and deepened.
To further reduce financial risks, parastatals’ borrowing activities should be monitored by the
Ministry of Finance’s debt unit.

20
21.
Additional structural reforms, along with progress in instituting trade and
financial sector reforms, would boost Mauritius’s chances of spurring private sector
development and raising growth. Most importantly, labor market reforms must unfold as
planned, with a view to increase wage flexibility. To enhance trade, a transparent tariff
framework with low and uniform rates would be preferable to a regime with multiple
exceptions. Reforms that further improve the institutional environment, including extending
the reach of the credit bureau and improving contract enforcement, could help lower
borrowing costs and make financing available to more small and medium-sized enterprises.
A close review of price controls—taking into account social implications and the need for
accompanying policies—should guide reforms in this area.

1/ General government and parastatals' gross debt.
2/ Derived as [(r - p(1+g) - g + ae(1+r)]/(1+g+p+gp)) times previous period debt ratio, with r = interest rate; p = growth rate of GDP deflator; g = real GDP growth rate; a = share of foreign-currency
denominated debt; and e = nominal exchange rate depreciation (measured by increase in local currency value of U.S. dollar).
3/ The real interest rate contribution is derived from the denominator in footnote 2/ as r - π (1+g) and the real growth contribution as -g.
4/ The exchange rate contribution is derived from the numerator in footnote 2/ as ae(1+r).
5/ For projections, this line includes exchange rate changes.
6/ Defined as public sector deficit, plus amortization of medium- and long-term public sector debt, plus short-term debt at end of previous period.
7/ The key variables include real GDP growth, real interest rate, and primary balance in percent of GDP.
8/ Derived as nominal interest expenditure divided by previous period debt stock.
9/ Assumes that key variables (real GDP growth, real interest rate, and other identified debt-creating flows) remain at the level of the last projection year.

1/ Derived as [r - g - ρ(1+g) + εα(1+r)]/(1+g+ρ+gρ) times previous period debt stock, with r = nominal effective interest rate on external debt; ρ = change in domestic GDP deflator in US dollar terms, g = real GDP growth rate,
ε = nominal appreciation (increase in dollar value of domestic currency), and α = share of domestic-currency denominated debt in total external debt.
2/ The contribution from price and exchange rate changes is defined as [-ρ(1+g) + εα(1+r)]/(1+g+ρ+gρ) times previous period debt stock. ρ increases with an appreciating domestic currency (ε > 0) and rising inflation (based on GDP deflator).
3/ For projection, line includes the impact of price and exchange rate changes.
4/ Defined as current account deficit, plus amortization on medium- and long-term debt, plus short-term debt at end of previous period.
5/ The key variables include real GDP growth; nominal interest rate; dollar deflator growth; and both non-interest current account and non-debt inflows in percent of GDP.
6/ Long-run, constant balance that stabilizes the debt ratio assuming that key variables (real GDP growth, nominal interest rate, dollar deflator growth, and non-debt inflows in percent of GDP) remain at their levels
of the last projection year.

Statement by the IMF Staff Representative
May 7, 2007
1.
This statement provides information that has become available since the staff report
was issued. The thrust of the staff appraisal is unchanged.
2.
Inflation and treasury bill yields have declined. After doubling to 12 percent (yearon-year) in late 2006, in part because of higher excise duties and the removal of subsidies,
inflation fell to 9.6 percent in March. The average yield on 91-day treasury bill rates fell from
close to 13 percent in February to 11.8 percent on April 27.
3.
The Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) of the Bank of Mauritius was launched
on April 23. The MPC, established under Section 54 of the Bank of Mauritius Act 2004, will
meet every two months and formulate monetary policy. In the first meeting, members
discussed the committee’s organization and reviewed the monetary policy framework. It was
not an interest rate-setting meeting. Mario Blejer, formerly of the IMF staff and previous
Governor of the central bank of Argentina, has been nominated as honorary advisor to the
MPC. The launch is an important step to increase the transparency and the effectiveness of
monetary policy.
4.
Downward pressure on the rupee has been reversed and international reserves
have increased. Over the past few weeks, the rupee has stabilized against the euro, and has
appreciated slightly against the weakening U.S. dollar. For the first time in three years, the
BoM intervened in the foreign exchange market by purchasing foreign exchange,
replenishing its reserves by a total of about US$140 million in February and March.
5.
Two TA missions visited Mauritius in March to support the authorities’ reform
agenda. An FAD TA mission assisted the authorities in their public financial management
reform effort, in particular by helping to identify key building blocks and an appropriate
sequence to implement a government-wide program budgeting system. A Statistics TA
mission made recommendations to address weaknesses in the Balance of Payments Statistics,
with a view to helping Mauritius to prepare for the planned subscription to the Special Data
Dissemination Standard (SDDS).

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
May 29, 2007

International Monetary Fund
700 19th Street, NW
Washington, D. C. 20431 USA

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2007 Article IV Consultation with
Mauritius
On May 7, 2007, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded the
Article IV consultation with Mauritius.1
Background
The loss of trade preferences in textiles in 2005, the reform to the European Union’s sugar
protocol for 2006–10, and higher international oil prices have brought about a permanent
deterioration in Mauritius’s terms of trade. The authorities have initiated broad-based reforms
to address recent economic setbacks and to raise growth to levels of the previous two
decades.
Real GDP growth is expected to reach over 4 percent in 2006/07 (fiscal year ending in June),
owing to a strong service sector outturn and slowing job losses in the textile sector.
Unemployment, however, remains close to its historic high. Inflation, after peaking in
December 2006—largely because of onetime budgetary measures and a weakening rupee—
fell to 9.2 percent in February 2007 (year-on-year).

1

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On
return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the
Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the
Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the
country's authorities.

2
The fiscal deficit target for 2006/07 (4 percent of GDP) is within reach, with the adjustment
relying partly on lower capital expenditure. The external current account deficit widened to
5.3 percent of GDP in 2005/06 because of weak textile and sugar exports and higher oil
prices. An aircraft import will further widen the current account deficit in 2006/07. The Bank of
Mauritius has continued to intervene in the interbank foreign exchange market and has
gradually raised its signaling rate to contain inflation. Foreign reserves have continued to
decline but have stayed at a comfortable level. The real effective exchange rate has
depreciated by over 10 percent since 2004.
Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors commended the authorities for the reforms introduced with the 2006/07
budget to adjust to the loss of trade preferences and reduce the fiscal deficit. While inflation
needs to be reduced, and the current account deficit and public debt remain large, Directors
considered that the economy is on the right track, supported by reforms to improve the
business environment, simplify the tax system, liberalize trade, open air access, and advance
economic restructuring, including the development of new sectors. Directors noted that labor
market reform will be needed to support economic restructuring. They encouraged the
authorities to maintain the reform momentum.
Directors welcomed the authorities’ efforts to tighten monetary policy. This should help to
reduce inflation and avoid entrenching inflation expectations. Most Directors encouraged the
Bank of Mauritius to consider raising the repo rate if inflation does not decline as expected.
They welcomed improvements in the monetary framework, and called for further development
of the institutional framework in order to strengthen the monetary policy transmission
mechanisms.
Directors noted that additional improvements in external competitiveness are needed to help
restore external balance. Wage restraint, productivity gains, and labor market flexibility are key
to achieve this. Directors considered that the flexible exchange rate regime has served
Mauritius well, with rupee depreciation softening the negative effect of the terms of trade
decline. They encouraged the authorities to limit foreign exchange intervention to smoothing
excess volatility.
Directors welcomed the progress made toward fiscal consolidation and better public
expenditure management, aimed at lowering public debt and improving the quality of the
budget. They noted that fiscal pressure in the medium term would require more decisive fiscal
consolidation and further improvements in expenditure management. They encouraged the
authorities to identify options for budgetary savings and to continue strengthening debt
management.
Directors considered that efforts to boost growth and employment could be complemented by
reforms that further liberalize trade, deepen the financial sector, and deregulate prices, while
taking into account the need to protect vulnerable groups. They commended the steps to

3
liberalize trade, and advocated a simple and transparent tariff framework. Addressing
institutional constraints in the financial sector could help lower borrowing costs and make more
financing available to small and medium-sized enterprises. A systematic review of price
controls, including a review of the largest public enterprises, should guide further reform in this
area.
Directors welcomed the 2007 Financial System Stability Assessment update and the reforms
implemented since the 2002–2003 Financial Sector Assessment Program (FSAP). Mauritius’s
financial sector has shown resilience to the loss of trade preferences. Going forward, Directors
called for further organizational and institutional strengthening in order to improve financial
sector regulation, supervision, and infrastructure.

Public Information Notices (PINs) form part of the IMF's efforts to promote transparency of the IMF's
views and analysis of economic developments and policies. With the consent of the country
(or countries) concerned, PINs are issued after Executive Board discussions of Article IV consultations
with member countries, of its surveillance of developments at the regional level, of post-program
monitoring, and of ex post assessments of member countries with longer-term program engagements.
PINs are also issued after Executive Board discussions of general policy matters, unless otherwise
decided by the Executive Board in a particular case.

Statement by Laurean W. Rutayisire, Executive Director for Mauritius
May 7, 2007

I - Introduction
On behalf of my Mauritian authorities, I would like to thank staff for the constructive policy
dialogue held in the context of 2007 Article IV consultations. I would also like to thank the
Board and Management for their continued policy advice to my Mauritian authorities in their
current endeavors to restructure the economy and address the new economic and financial
challenges following the phasing out of preferential trade agreements on textiles and sugar.
My authorities are in broad agreement with staff’s analysis and policy recommendations.
They look forward to continue benefiting from the Fund’s technical assistance in their efforts
to strengthen the ongoing reform program.
The loss of preferential access to the European market for the textile and sugar which used to
be the pillars of the Mauritian economy, combined with the high oil prices, have led to a
slowdown of growth, high fiscal deficit and an unsustainable public debt. To reverse this
situation and pave the way for a return to robust and durable high growth, the authorities
initiated in 2006 broad-based reforms. Trade and air access were liberalized while inroads
were made in restructuring the economy. The tax system was further simplified and the
business environment liberalized. The authorities are cognizant that further sustained efforts
are needed to reduce inflation, the fiscal deficit and public indebtedness as well as the deficit
of the external current accounts. My Mauritian authorities remain fully committed in
implementing policies and reforms to achieve these objectives.
II - Recent Macroeconomic Developments
Macroeconomic performance in 2005/2006 has shown some signs of recovery with the
revamp of real GDP growth which is estimated at 3.7 percent against 3.0 percent in
2004/2005. While the contribution of sugar and EPZ sectors to this growth has declined, that
of the service sector has increased thus enhancing the trend observed in the recent years.
However, owing to the high oil prices and the elimination of some subsidies, headline
inflation has increased. In response to the inflationary pressures, the Bank of Mauritius has
gradually raised its repo rate set as a key policy rate. The weak export performance following
the loss of trade preferences as well as the higher import price of petroleum products have
resulted in a widening of the current account deficit. The fiscal deficit reached an estimated
5.3 percent of GDP, reflecting mainly higher interest payments. The public debt is still high,
at 71.3 percent of GDP. As for the unemployment rate, it remains elevated mainly because of
lack of new employment opportunities. While the government is working with social partners
to further improve wage flexibility and implement labor market reforms focused on training
and reskilling programs, it will take time for new jobs to be created and absorb the excess

2
labor force. Timely aid-for-trade support from the international community could enable
Mauritius to gain quick rebound from this situation.
Going forward, the authorities are committed to pursue the implementation of the economic
program started with the 2006/07 budget while further increasing the public awareness and
adjusting the sequencing of measures with a view to achieving the objectives set, while
maintaining the political support needed to implement the reforms.
III - Macroeconomic Policies and Reforms for 2007
Fiscal Policy
The authorities will continue their efforts to achieve further fiscal consolidation. The
medium-term budget deficit target has been set at 3 percent of GDP. However, the
authorities would like to note that they need to give careful consideration to the social
environment and the political trade-off between reorienting productive expenditure to
improve the quality of the budget and further deficit reductions.
The authorities will continue to reduce fiscal vulnerability by improving the quality of
expenditure and strengthening debt management. The three-year rolling Medium Term
Expenditure Framework will be extended to all ministries in the 2007/08 budget together
with improving the human capacities in terms of monitoring and macromodeling of the
MTEF. The authorities will also reallocate fiscal resources to education and infrastructure as
well as to well-targeted social programs owing to their positive impact in advancing the
reform agenda. On the revenue side, it is the authorities’ intention to pursue efforts to tighten
tax loopholes and broaden the tax base. They will also review the opportunities of a broader
involvement of the private sector in improving the efficiency of public enterprises.
Monetary and Exchange Rate Policies
Policy objectives in this area aim at supporting macroeconomic stability, notably low and
stable inflation, to further improve the external competitiveness of the economy. The
authorities agree on the need to reduce the high headline inflation to the medium-term target
of 4.5 – 5 percent. In their efforts to enhance the use of the repo as an effective policy rate,
the authorities will develop the institutional framework with the view to improve on
transmission mechanisms of monetary policy and communication with the public. The
establishment of the Monetary Policy Committee has been completed. As for the exchange
rate, the authorities agree that further adjustment may be required if the additional expected
decline in the terms of trade materializes. However, central bank’s interventions will be
limited to smoothing excess volatility to avoid postponing adjustment. The authorities
believe that the ongoing economic reforms will promote stronger capital inflows.

3
Financial Sector Issues
The Mauritian financial sector remains in sound health. Efforts to improve financial
intermediation will be accelerated with a view to lowering the borrowing costs and make
more financing available to the private sector, notably small and medium-sized enterprises.
The authorities welcome the recommendations of the recent FSAP mission while looking for
more suitable actions to move forward the development of the financial sector given the
challenges facing the country. They are hopeful that they will continue to benefit from Fund
assistance in implementing these recommendations, including the regulation governing the
foreign exchange bureaus.
Over the recent years, significant progress was made in the areas of unifying the banks’
licensing, establishing a Credit Bureau and developing a range of financing schemes under
the Empowerment Program. The authorities are committed to further strengthening banking
supervision and improving cooperation between the central bank and Financial Services
Commission.
Structural Reforms
Given the important changes affecting the economy of Mauritius, the authorities are
determined, with the assistance of the European Union and cooperation with all stakeholders,
to undertake comprehensive restructuring plans for the sugar and textile sectors. Emphasis is
also being placed on the tourism sector, which has done very well and is expected to make
significant contribution on the employment front.
On the labor market, reforms will be implemented as planned, with the involvement of all
stakeholders notably employers and unions. The aim is to enhance the framework for more
flexibility in wages and regulations. Consensus building is of fundamental importance to
sustain progress in this area.
As regards price controls, remarkable progress has been made towards price liberalization
while taking into account the need to limit monopoly power and protect vulnerable groups as
well as local production. The authorities will further strengthen the competition framework
and the system of social transfers.
In the area of trade reform, it is worth noting that the authorities have made commendable
progress to foster positive prospects for economic growth. In particular, tariffs in sensitive
sectors have been reduced. The authorities agree that it would be relatively difficult to
liberalize trade in all sectors without the necessary laws and policies, and also given the
significant adverse financial impact of such general liberalization. In this respect, my
authorities call on the international community for the urgent implementation of the “Aid for
Trade” initiative. In their continued efforts to advocate for this initiative, they are of the view

4
that tariff reductions should be undertaken while enhancing countries’ capacity to define,
finance and implement accompanying measures. They also continue to promote the need to
harmonize regional integration schemes and timetables developed by SADC and COMESA.
IV - Conclusion
My authorities are committed to pursue their reform agenda designed to boost economic
growth and put it on a sustainable path, diversify the economy and reduce poverty while
meeting the challenges facing the country over the period ahead. Mobilizing and
strengthening public support will be essential in my authorities’ endeavors to speed up the
