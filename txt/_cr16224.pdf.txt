IMF Executive Board Concludes 2016 Article IV Consultation with The Bahamas

On June 8, 2016, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded the
Article IV consultation1 with The Bahamas.
Economic growth is estimated to have stalled in 2015, as a modest increase in air tourism
arrivals was not sufficient to offset a contraction in domestic demand and weak exports of
goods. Private consumption and investment were weighed down by headwinds from fiscal
consolidation, as well as an end to construction and uncertainty over the opening of the Baha
Mar megaresort. Inflation was moderate at 1.9 percent on average in 2015, despite a temporary
increase owing to Value Added Tax (VAT) introduction in January 2015. Unemployment, after
a brief dip earlier in the year, rose to 14.8 percent in November, as workers hired for the planned
Baha Mar opening were later dismissed. Double-digit unemployment and the elevated share of
nonperforming loans continue to constrain private credit (which fell by 1 percent year-on-year in
December 2015).
Smooth VAT introduction has contributed to fiscal consolidation. VAT revenue over the first 12
months, at $536 million (about 6 percent of GDP), has exceeded expectations. As a result, the
FY2014/15 (ending in June 2015) deficit is estimated to have declined to 4.4 percent of GDP
(down from revised 5.6 percent in FY2013/14). Available data for the first seven months of
FY2015/16 suggest a further decline in the deficit, by about 1 percentage point, compared to the
same period a year ago. The central government debt-to-GDP-ratio nevertheless reached 66.5
percent in December 2015, pointing to limited fiscal space. The current account deficit declined
significantly, to 15.3 percent of GDP in 2015 (compared to 22 percent a year earlier), driven
primarily by lower imports owing to the decline in oil prices and halt to Baha Mar construction.
International reserves, supported in part by government external borrowing, increased to $981

million at end–March 2016, equivalent to about 2.4 months of next years’ projected imports of
goods and services.
Prospects are tempered by Baha Mar related uncertainties and low potential growth. Growth is
expected to strengthen to about 0.5 percent this year, supported by continued growth in air tourist
arrivals and moderating headwinds to private consumption and investment. Looking forward,
while Baha Mar opening is expected to provide a temporary boost to growth, helping to close the
still sizeable output gap, structural impediments continue to constrain potential growth. Staff
estimates point to potential growth between 1 and 1.5 percent over the medium term, down from
close to 3 percent at the start of the century. This outlook is subject to mainly downside risks,
calling for continued fiscal consolidation to rebuild fiscal and external policy buffers and
boosting investor confidence, as well as a decisive shift towards implementation of structural
reforms to improve competitiveness, reduce unemployment and raise potential growth.
Executive Board Assessment2
Executive Directors noted that economic activity stalled in 2015, weighed down by weak
domestic demand and goods exports. The current account deficit declined significantly but
remains sizable. Going forward, the outlook remains challenging, especially with high youth
unemployment and low productivity growth. Against this backdrop, Directors emphasized the
importance of continued fiscal consolidation to rebuild fiscal and external buffers and structural
reforms to improve competitiveness, reduce unemployment and raise potential growth. They also
underscored the need to address financial sector challenges.
Directors commended the authorities for a successful VAT introduction which has contributed to
fiscal consolidation. They encouraged the authorities to resist pressures to introduce exemptions
and to ensure continued strong implementation. Directors called for continued consolidation to
reduce the public debt to GDP ratio and ensure sustainability. On expenditures, Directors
emphasized the need to contain increases in the public wage bill and to orient the budget towards
growth-enhancing infrastructure spending. As regards fiscal reforms, Directors advocated
moving towards a fully-fledged central revenue agency, improvements in tax administration, and
a review of the efficiency of tax exemptions and concessions, including to the tourism sector.
They supported the on-going reforms to modernize the public financial management system and
called for extending state owned enterprise reform beyond the energy sector. Directors also
emphasized the need for timely pension system reforms.
To address impediments to growth, Directors called for decisive implementation of structural
reforms, including in the context of the National Development Plan. These reforms should aim at

strengthening the business environment, raising human capital, reducing skill mismatches, and
lowering high labor and energy costs. Directors also highlighted potential gains from efficient
investment in information and communication technology, transportation, public utilities,
economic diversification, and enhanced resilience to natural disasters.
Directors welcomed recent progress in financial sector reforms, including in addressing gaps in
the AML/CFT regulation and implementation of the new Basel II/III regime. They encouraged
the authorities to enhance their crisis management framework. Directors called for greater
emphasis on risk-based financial sector supervision and regulation, given global “de-risking”
trends, and strong efforts to ensure compliance and close communication across stakeholders.
Directors called for renewed efforts to resolve the overhang of non-performing loans to spur
credit growth.

THE BAHAMAS
STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2016 ARTICLE IV CONSULTATION
May 16, 2016

Context. Economic activity has stalled and near-term prospects are tempered by
uncertainty over opening of the Baha Mar resort. Smooth implementation of the new
VAT regime has contributed to fiscal consolidation, while lower energy prices and the
winding down of Baha Mar’s construction have helped narrow the still sizeable current
account deficit. Nevertheless, fiscal and external vulnerabilities persist and mounting
structural impediments constrain potential growth.
Key policy advice


Safeguarding fiscal and external stability. Continued fiscal consolidation is critical
for rebuilding fiscal and external policy buffers and boosting investor confidence.
Priorities include resolute implementation of the current VAT regime with few
exemptions, stronger efforts to rationalize spending, far-reaching state-owned
enterprise reform and structural reforms to enhance competitiveness.



Policies towards more jobs and stronger growth. A decisive shift towards
implementation of structural policies is needed to improve competitiveness, reduce
high structural and youth unemployment and to raise potential growth. Key priorities
include strengthening the business environment, raising human capital and reducing
skill mismatches, and reducing costs. Growth-friendly fiscal reforms, including
investing in growth-enhancing infrastructure, in the context of a credible mediumterm budgetary framework would allow fiscal policy to better balance the need for
continued consolidation and support for the recovery.



Addressing financial sector challenges. Renewed efforts to spur credit growth by
cleaning up bank balance sheets, along with advancing other financial sector
reforms, can further enhance growth and help preserve financial stability. Emerging
challenges from global “de-risking” trends call for further emphasis on risk-based
financial sector supervision and regulation, strong implementation and efforts to
ensure compliance with the AML/CFT framework and close communication across
stakeholders.

Economic activity stalled. Preliminary estimates suggest that real GDP contracted by
1.7 percent in 2015, as a modest increase in air tourism arrivals (see Figure 1) was not sufficient to
offset a contraction in domestic demand and weak goods exports. Private consumption and
investment were weighed down by headwinds from fiscal consolidation, as well as an end to

VAT introduction contributing to fiscal consolidation. Reports suggest relatively smooth
implementation and an efficient VAT regime. While there are some concerns about the accuracy of
the registration database, registration, filing and compliance rates appear to have been broadly
comparable to regional standards. VAT revenue over the first 12 months, at $536 million (about
6 percent of GDP), has exceeded expectations (Figure 2). As a result, the FY2014/15 (ending in June
2015) deficit is estimated to have declined to 4.4 percent of GDP (down from revised 5.6 percent in
FY2013/14). Data for the first seven months of FY2015/16 point to a further decline in the deficit, by

Narrower, but still sizeable, current account deficit. The current account deficit declined
significantly, to 15.3 percent of GDP in 2015 (compared to 22 percent a year earlier), driven primarily

Further contraction in private sector credit. Double-digit unemployment, as well as tight
bank lending conditions continue to constrain private credit (which fell by 1 percent year-on-year in
December 2015) (Figure 4). The share of nonperforming loans (NPLs), mostly mortgages, remains
elevated (at 15.2 percent of total loans in February 2016), while provisioning has been increasing.
Despite stalling economic activity, available prudential indicators continue to point to a wellcapitalized, liquid and profitable domestic banking system as a whole. However, the financial
position of one state-owned bank, which represents around nine percent of domestic banking
system assets, remains challenged with accumulated losses that continue to erode its capital base.

Prospects tempered by Baha Mar related uncertainties and low potential growth. Real GDP is
expected to stabilize, with positive growth of about ½ percent this year, supported by continued
growth in air tourist arrivals and moderating headwinds to private consumption and investment.
Looking forward, staff projections assume that Baha Mar opening provides a boost to growth in
2018 and 2019, helping to close the still sizeable output gap. Structural impediments continue to
constrain potential growth. Staff estimates point to potential growth between 1 and 1½ percent

over the medium term, down from close to 3 percent at the start of the century (see Box 2). The still
negative output gap and remaining slack in the labor market suggest that domestic inflationary
pressures are likely to remain muted over the next few years. VAT revenue is expected to support
further fiscal consolidation and help stabilize central government debt over the medium-term, albeit
at a higher level (at about 67 percent) than previously expected. Although the current account
deficit is expected to narrow further, supported by low oil prices and an expected boost to tourism
receipts, it remains elevated (at about 7 percent of GDP) over the medium term. Absent further
foreign borrowing, international reserves are therefore likely to increase only gradually.

Outlook subject to mainly downside risks. Setbacks in fiscal consolidation and a
worsening of the macroeconomic outlook owing to a slowdown in advanced economies could
heighten risks to macroeconomic stability and the country’s credit rating. Continued “de-risking”
trends, including loss of correspondent banking relations (CBRs), could create an uncertain
environment for businesses and have adverse implications for the financial services sector. Other key
risks include a longer-than-expected delay in Baha Mar’s opening, U.S. dollar appreciation leading to
a further weakening of cost competitiveness, natural disasters, and, over the medium term, the
potential emergence of Cuba as a competitor for U.S. based tourists (see Table 6). On the upside,
the Baha Mar creditor (through its appointed receivers) has an opportunity to promptly complete
and open the resort.
7.
Past Fund advice. The last Article IV consultation was completed in June, 2015. The
Executive Board called for (i) structural reforms to strengthen competitiveness, raise potential
growth and lower unemployment; (ii) continued efforts to strengthen the fiscal position; (iii) efforts
to further strengthen financial sector regulation and supervision; and (iv) policies that will address
high NPLs. The authorities’ policies have been broadly in line with this advice, although
implementation has been gradual. The authorities are moving ahead with finalizing the National
Development Plan and have taken steps towards energy sector reform (para 11). Fiscal consolidation
continues, although at a more gradual pace than previously envisaged (paras 9 and 13). Authorities
continue to advance financial sector reforms (para 17 and box 3). Progress in addressing NPLs has
been slow (para 12).

Box 1. VAT Impact
Consistent with international evidence of incomplete pass-through of tax increases to prices, VAT
introduction in January 2015 likely had only a temporary and muted impact on consumer inflation,
further dampened by still weak consumer demand and the concurrent decline in international oil prices.
Reform. As part of the VAT reform, the authorities have eliminated the 10 percent hotel room tax,
reduced import tariffs on a number of items, as well as adjusted several domestic tax rates including
rates on property taxes, business licenses, and stamp duties. Overall, estimates suggest a significant
net increase in tax revenue.
Temporary, muted increase in headline inflation. While the tax reform has made an important
contribution to maintaining macroeconomic stability and strengthening policy credibility, it is also
expected to have temporarily increased inflation and, even with low estimated fiscal multipliers, to
have dampened near-term economic activity. The VAT was introduced at a time when consumer
demand was already relatively depressed, with a high unemployment rate and a large negative output
gap, and coincided with a large decline in global oil prices. Both factors are likely to have dampened
the impact of VAT introduction on prices. Estimates based on a simple forecasting model for inflation
suggest that after controlling for other inflation determinants, VAT introduction increased annual CPI
inflation in 2015 by about 2 percentage points, reflecting less than complete pass-through.1/ The
impact on inflation was also likely dampened by the simultaneous reduction in several import duties
and excises.
Impact on inflation sub-components. Monthly data on the retail price index and its subcomponents
(relative to the average inflation in previous years) shows a temporary spike in headline inflation in
January 2015. Headline and median inflation increased by about 2½ to 3½ percentage points in
January. Pass-through appears to have been immediate and near-complete for sub-components such
as food, beverages, furnishings and household equipment, health, communication and recreation
(accounting for about 26 percent of the consumption goods included in the retail price index). Passthrough has been incomplete for other subcomponents, including the largest subcomponent of
housing, utilities and energy (more than 30 percent of the total), as well education, restaurants and
hotels and miscellaneous services. For some

Box 2. Potential Growth
Staff analysis points to a significant decline in potential growth over the last 15 years. Furthermore, the
large negative output gap is not expected to be closed before 2019. A comparison with other tourism
intensive countries in the region generally shows similar trends.
Methods. Potential growth and the output gap are not observable variables and estimates are subject
to significant uncertainty. We therefore use three different approaches to estimate them. First, we use
the multivariate filter approach developed by Blagrave et al. (2015).1/ The structure of the filter relates
the output gap to changes in inflation (i.e. the Philips curve) and slack in the labor market. This
pragmatic approach can be easily applied to many countries, as it only requires data on three
observable variables: real GDP, inflation and

growth.2/ Finally, we benchmark our results against a
simple univariate filter. Each of the three approaches

have pros and cons. For example, while both the

are based on economic theory, they also rely on

several simplifying assumptions. In contrast, the
univariate filter has no economic theory content, but is simple and widely used.
Lower potential growth and a still sizeable output gap. Although there are differences in
magnitudes, all three methods suggest that potential growth has declined significantly over the last 15
years. The decline started already in the late 1990’s, with potential growth hitting a low point in the
immediate aftermath of the global financial crisis (GFC).
Output Gap
Since then, potential growth has recovered modestly,

Box 2. Potential Growth (Concluded)
Decline in potential growth driven mostly by TFP. All factor inputs have contributed to the decline
in potential growth. However, the deterioration in growth prospects has been driven mostly by more
negative TFP growth, which has been about -1 percent of GDP on average since 2000. These results are
similar to those obtained by Thacker et al. (2012),

Cross country comparisons. Applying the same
approaches to Barbados and Jamaica suggests that
potential growth has declined also in these
countries. However, the pre-crisis decline in
potential growth started earlier and was larger in
The Bahamas. Over the last few years, estimates
suggest that potential growth has been recovering
somewhat faster in Jamaica. All three countries are
also still struggling to close the output gap, amid
both relatively low actual and potential growth.

POLICY DISCUSSIONS
A. Policies Towards Stronger Growth
8.
Macroeconomic policies geared towards stability. The nature of The Bahamas as a small,
open island economy with a strong commitment to a fixed exchange regime and an extensive
capital flow management (CFM) system, as well as limited policy buffers, leaves the authorities with
few macroeconomic policy tools. In this context, monetary policy is constrained by the eventual
increase in U.S. interest rates and fiscal policy needs to be geared primarily towards ensuring debt
sustainability. Against this background, continued fiscal policy tightening centered on reducing
current expenditure, while protecting necessary social spending, would be the main policy lever to
respond to external shocks.

9.
Fiscal consolidation in the low growth environment. The VAT reform has made an
important contribution to maintaining macroeconomic stability and strengthening policy credibility.
Authorities expect that strong VAT collection, together with reforms to enhance revenue
administration raising additional revenue of up to 2½ percent of GDP, will contribute to significant
consolidation in the near-term. However, with weaker than expected growth weighing on revenue
collection, the authorities’ plan that seeks to reduce the FY2015/16 fiscal deficit to 1.5 percent of
GDP and to achieve a near balanced budget by 2017/18 appears too optimistic. Staff projections
suggest a still significant, but more realistic

10.
Investing in growth-enhancing infrastructure. To support near-term economic activity,
staff sees room for shifting spending away from current spending and towards more productive and
growth-friendly infrastructure spending. Priorities include efficient investment in information and
communication technology, transportation, public utilities, as well as projects that support economic
diversification, increase domestic value added in the dominant tourism sector and enhance
resilience to natural disasters. Using responsible public-private partnerships, where relevant, can
help reduce the burden of higher investment on government finances.

10

THE BAHAMAS

11.
Structural reforms to lift potential, reduce unemployment, and enhance
competitiveness. Staff estimates that negative TFP growth and smaller contributions from both
capital accumulation and labor have contributed to a significant decline in potential growth since
2000 (see Box 2). Moreover, the non-accelerating rate of unemployment has been consistently
increasing over the same time period (see Figure 1). Alternative indicators of competitiveness point
to persistent weaknesses, such as elevated energy costs and high costs of doing business. The
authorities have completed a comprehensive State of the Nation diagnostic that identifies a broad
strategy for structural reforms, a first step towards completing their National Development Plan
(NDP). The next steps, expected to be completed later this year, include further national dialogue
and development of a comprehensive package of specific reform measures. Many structural
measures, such as fundamental state-owned enterprise (SOE) reforms, will take time to bear fruit.
Staff therefore argued for an urgent shift towards implementation of growth-friendly structural
reforms, focusing on the following main priorities:



Improving competitiveness through reducing costs. Policies should aim at reducing energy and
other utility costs and better aligning wages with productivity. Staff urged the authorities to
advance state-owned enterprise (SOE) reforms, including reducing the entities’ operational
inefficiencies, fostering an enabling regulatory environment and aligning tariffs with costs of
service delivery. Regular financial reporting and consistent monitoring are also essential to
ensuring accountability. Staff welcomed recent steps towards energy sector reform. An external
management company is coming on board and parliament has passed legislation for reforming
the loss-making Bahamas Electricity Company, establishing an independent regulator, and
refinancing legacy debts and fund capital improvements. Staff argued that reforms should be
extended to other SOEs, including Bahamasair and the Water and Sewerage Corporation.



THE BAHAMAS

12.
Policies to revive credit growth. Staff noted that discussions between the government
and banks about placing distressed mortgage assets in special purpose vehicles (SPVs) have been
protracted, owing in part to social concerns. Resolving debt overhang in a timely and socially
responsible manner would help unlock resources for private sector financing, thereby supporting
growth and further strengthening financial stability. In this context, the authorities should consider
implementing a comprehensive framework for resolution that may include, inter alia, the
establishment of a specialized agency. Work on establishing a credit bureau, which could eventually
improve well-grounded access to credit, continues. Prompt finalization of this work is key, given that
more time will be required to build comprehensive information regarding existing debt obligations
and repayment histories.
Authorities’ views


Authorities affirmed that they remain on track to achieve their deficit target in FY2015/16,
pointing to tighter spending control and seasonality in the collection of business license fees
and property taxes. Authorities expect to reallocate spending items to accommodate costs
related to Hurricane Joaquin, with reconstruction spanning several years. They argued that room
for increasing capital spending in the near term was constrained by project execution capacity.
Authorities expect to achieve further reduction of the deficit to below 1 percent next year mainly
through modernization of revenue administration, stronger enforcement efforts and spending
control.



Authorities were optimistic that new investment projects coming on stream in the near term have
the potential to boost growth and lower unemployment. Authorities nevertheless fully agree
with the need to design and implement an ambitious growth strategy, acknowledging that weak
competitiveness, low productivity and high costs of doing business are hampering growth. They
see the NDP as a critical device to strengthen and diversify the economy. Finally, the authorities
recognized the need for a decisive and timely resolution of NPLs. They noted that banks have
been more aggressive recently in restructuring and other forms of mortgage relief and customer
assistance programs. The authorities admitted that progress has been slow, but that they
continue to work closely with banks on a new framework for resolution.

B. Ensuring Fiscal and External Sustainability
13.
Rebuilding fiscal policy buffers. The pace of fiscal consolidation has been more gradual
than previously envisaged owing to both weaker than expected growth and recent revisions in the
fiscal accounts. Looking forward, and despite the more gradual pace of consolidation, the primary
fiscal balance is expected to return to a surplus over the next two years. As a result, the central
government debt to GDP ratio is expected to stabilize at 67 percent of GDP by FY2016/17 and begin
to decline gradually thereafter (Annex I: Debt Sustainability Analysis). Fiscal vulnerabilities extend
beyond the central government. SOE’s debt amounted to an additional 17.4 percent of GDP in
December 2015 and the unfunded pension liabilities of the public pension system, already sizeable
at $2.2 billion (about 26.2 percent of GDP), are projected to grow further in the next decades (Annex
II: Pension Reform).

12

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

THE BAHAMAS

14.
Following smooth VAT introduction, focus on other fiscal reforms. Further initiatives
include a review of all revenue lines, and modernization of customs, property tax, vehicle fees, and
immigration fee administration. The authorities recently stepped up revenue administration reform
by introducing online payment of business license fees, electronic filing of customs import
declaration, and merging the operations of key domestic revenue agencies as a step towards
establishing a Central Revenue Agency (CRA). The government is also taking steps to introduce a
National Health Insurance (NHI) scheme to be rolled out in phases, with public consultation still
under way and with the cost and sources of funding yet to be determined. The authorities released a
consultation paper on fiscal responsibility legislation in May 2015, which has yet to be discussed.
15.

Combination of growth-friendly reforms to help fiscal consolidation.



Revenue reforms. Staff called for standing firm against pressures to weaken the VAT’s efficiency
through introducing exemptions to items such as food, medical and insurance services, which
could amount to an estimated ¾ percent of GDP in revenue losses. Social concerns should
instead be addressed by targeted adjustments to the safety net. In addition, the authorities
should comprehensively review other tax exemptions and concessions, including to the tourism
sector, and consider eliminating low revenue yielding fees and duties, and further simplifying
domestic taxes (such as the business license fee regime) that are not business–friendly. While
VAT introduction has increased tax utilization capacity, there is substantial room to raise more
revenue through non-distortionary consumption taxes to compensate for revenue losses
elsewhere. Staff welcomes recent progress in improving revenue administration. Efforts should
focus on moving further towards a fully–fledged CRA with well-defined institutional framework
and governance structure empowered to administer most domestic taxes, thereby reducing
costs, and improving efficiency and compliance. Further steps to ensure continued success in
VAT implementation include more focus on program development, planning and performance
monitoring based on operational data and establishing an audit program.



Expenditure reforms. Fiscal consolidation has so far focused on the revenue side, while
government expenditure has been drifting upwards after the GFC. Staff reiterated that
rationalization of current expenditure in the context of a medium–term budget framework (see
below) would help preserve the hard-won benefits of the VAT, enhance policy credibility in the
low growth environment and strengthen fiscal sustainability. Such a framework should seek to
contain further growth in current spending and gradually unwinding crisis related spending
increases. The authorities should resist pressure to

Structural reforms and fiscal consolidation to address competitiveness challenges. The
authorities remain firmly committed to the exchange rate peg (US$1=B$1), which provides an
important anchor. They are moving only gradually to reform the CFM system with recent efforts
focused on easing personal business transactions and loosening limits on cross-border investments.
Staff projections reflect an improvement in the current account over the medium term to around
7 percent of GDP, allowing for modest rebuilding of external buffers. Despite significant
uncertainties, the external sector assessment points to an external position that is weaker than
suggested by fundamentals and desirable policy settings (Annex III: External Assessment). Other
indicators, such as relatively high energy costs and indicators of the business environment show The
Bahamas falling further behind its peers, and the declining share of tourism among Caribbean
countries that focus on a relatively expensive,

THE BAHAMAS

authorities have already raised the minimum wage and increased social spending. They continue
to review social assistance benefits, and would prefer to increase them further instead of
introducing exemptions that would reduce revenues and compromise the integrity of the VAT
regime. Authorities are optimistic that disciplined implementation of reforms to enhance
revenue administration will raise significant additional revenue. The authorities recognize the
benefits of a comprehensive review of concessions, including those to the tourism sector.


Authorities noted that efforts to introduce a medium term framework are moving in the right
direction. They are taking steps to modernize their public financial management system and
remain committed to gradually moving towards a more robust medium-term fiscal framework.
They continue to revamp the accounting systems and to advance other budget reforms. They
are open, in principle, to adopting a fiscal rule to restrain expenditure growth, but argue that
they first need to create the right administrative conditions to ensure fiscal discipline. While
acknowledging that SOEs remain a drain on the budget, authorities expect that ongoing
initiatives to increase efficiencies and recent investments will reduce government subsidies. The
authorities are committed to rolling out NHI, but are mindful of the need to avoid causing
economic disruptions. They consider pension reform, including moving to a defined contribution
based regime, an important objective and acknowledge the need to commence public
consultation soon.



Authorities agreed that comprehensive structural reforms and fiscal consolidation would help
enhance competitiveness and build external buffers. The authorities pointed out that the current
level of international reserves remain within target levels and argued that an expected
improvement in tourism earnings and foreign direct investment, together with structural
reforms, will facilitate stable and organic accumulation of reserves.

C. Addressing Financial Sector Challenges
17.
Building on recent progress. Staff welcomes recent progress in financial sector reforms
which address some of the priorities identified in the 2013 FSAP, including further strengthening of
the regulatory and supervisory framework, reporting under the U.S. Foreign Accounts Tax
Compliance Act (FATCA), and implementation of the new Basel II/III regime (see Box 3).
Nevertheless, pockets of financial sector vulnerabilities remain. Authorities are encouraged to move
expeditiously in strengthening their framework for crisis management and bank resolution. Despite
active support in the past, further efforts are needed to put in place and implement a
comprehensive plan to address financial difficulties and governance of one state owned bank.
18.
Additional scrutiny from global “de-risking” trends. The financial system has been
exposed to global “de-risking” trends as reflected in, thus far temporary, interruptions of
correspondent banking relations (CBRs) in some institutions (see Box 4: Loss of CBRs). While loss of
CBRs has not led to significant disruptions thus far, continued measures could have an adverse
impact on the financial sector and the economy as a whole. The financial services sector is relatively
large and sophisticated, reflecting the country’s status as an offshore financial center, and accounts

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

15

THE BAHAMAS

for more than 10 percent of GDP and 2.7 percent of total employment.1,2 However, global “derisking” trends could lead to even more scrutiny, further reducing the sector’s contribution to
growth and employment, and thus complicating efforts to diversify the economy.
19.
Addressing challenges from loss of CBRs. In addition to strengthening their overall riskbased framework for regulation and supervision, the authorities have taken several steps to address
risks from loss of CBRs. The central bank conducted in June 2015 a survey to gain a better view of
correspondent banking activities and the impact of recent measures and plans to reissue the survey
in 2016. The Caribbean Financial Action Task Force (CFATF) has recently recognized progress made
in addressing the deficiencies identified in their previous report. Following the December 2015
onsite mission, an updated report and policy recommendations will be discussed at the CFATF
plenary later this year. In advance of the evaluation, the central bank finalized amendments to its
AML/CFT Guidelines and introduced new Wire Transfer regulations. The authorities are also actively
participating in regional bodies that aim to create collective solutions to loss of CBRs. Looking
forward, increased scrutiny calls for effective implementation of AML/CFT regulations and strong
efforts to ensure compliance, as well as added emphasizes on the need to keep pace with evolving
international standards by promptly addressing any gaps. Continued evaluation of the supervisory
and regulatory framework for both banks and non-banks to proactively identify and address risks in
a timely and assertive manner is critical.



The authorities recognize the challenges stemming from global “de-risking” trends, and
expressed their commitment to promptly addressing them. They will continue to monitor the
industry, provide assistance to banks and encourage them to take a risk-based approach, and
work on any remaining regulatory gaps. The authorities will also continue to coordinate with
regional counterparts to mitigate any adverse economic fallout. They also pointed to the already
strong overall AML/CFT regime in place, and called for more clarity on regulatory expectations
and requirements from international banks and from source jurisdictions.

frameworks. Following IMF technical assistance in 2015, CBB expects to issue a consultation
paper that proposes a hybrid, as opposed to purely judicial, approach to bank resolution.



Bank stress tests. The latest Financial Stability Report (June 2015) shows that capital adequacy
ratios (CARs) are high on average, in excess of 30 percent, and the banking system is resilient
to several shocks. For example, even under a scenario with a 200 percent increase in NPLs,
CARs remain above the 17 percent regulatory minimum, with the exception of one bank,
whose CAR was still above the trigger rate that would have mandated additional capital.



Basel II/III. Implementation commenced in 2016Q1. Most foreign-owned institutions already
observe Basel III. The first official reporting under the new framework occurred in January 2016
for commercial banks, and end-March for international firms. CBB analysis suggests that banks’
capital levels remain robust also under the new Basel II/III framework, although some
individual institutions are “likely to be stressed” by the new requirements. Assuming full
implementation of capital conservation buffer (CCB) and total eligible capital, only one bank
would fall short. With respect to CCB and countercyclical capital buffer, four banks would not
meet the additional requirement.



Credit unions. The CBB has assumed regulatory and supervisory authority for the domestic
credit union system comprising nine institutions (with assets equivalent to about 3.5 percent of
the domestic banking systems’ assets). Upon adoption, credit union deposits have Deposit
Insurance Corporation protection.



Credit Bureau. Preparatory work continues. Necessary legislation is expected to be presented
to the parliament soon with operations starting 12-16 months after legislative approval.



U.S. Foreign Accounts Tax Compliance Act (FATCA). Reporting under FATCA commenced in
September 2015.

Box 4. Loss of CBRs
Like other countries in the region, The Bahamas has been impacted by global “de-risking” trends that
have resulted in additional scrutiny of financial institutions and, in a few cases, to temporary
interruptions in correspondent banking relations (CBRs). All affected institutions have thus far been able
to avoid significant disruptions in their services by proactively relying on multiple service providers,
switching to alternative providers or negotiating continuation in CBRs.
Impact on financial institutions. A total of six institutions, mainly domestic commercial banks and
standalone international banks, representing about 19 percent of domestic banking system assets,
have recently lost CBRs. All of them either had additional CBRs; found replacements; or were able to
negotiate a continuation in service (including against an additional annual fee). Canadian banks and
other international banks continue to rely on their head offices and parent banks for CBRs. Money
transfer business (MTB) has also been impacted. One domestic bank closed its Western Union money
transfer franchise in summer 2015, while another MTB provider has been notified about a possible
termination of their banking relationship. Adverse impacts on bank operations have been reflected
mainly in prolonged clearance procedures and higher investment and staffing costs stemming from
additional reporting requirements and scrutiny. Business segments that have been impacted include
credit card payments, cash management services, investment services, clearing and settlement,
international wire transfers and remittance services.
Reasons for termination. While reasons for terminations of CBRs by global banks have not always
been clearly stated, they appear to be driven by stricter application of source country (mainly U.S.)
regulations, and more generally, costs related to the changing regulatory environment. The general
view is that the costs of AML compliance outweigh the profits generated by CBR services, making it
particularly difficult for smaller local institutions with fewer international transactions to maintain their
CBRs. Some terminations also appear to be driven by implementation of a risk-based approach. In
particular, consistent with experiences across the region, anecdotal evidence suggests that
international correspondent banks are uncomfortable providing services to domestic banks that do
business with either MTBs or on-line gaming operators (so called “web-shops”), which are perceived as
higher risk.1/
Replacements. Replacement CBRs have been provided by other major global banks. Canadian banks
present in the domestic market do not seem to be interested in taking over correspondent banking
business and alternative service providers, i.e. second tier U.S. based banks, were generally not seen as
credible alternatives to traditional providers.
Risks. The impact has so far been limited to those institutions that lost CBRs, with no major disruptions
in service. However, continued withdrawal of services could create an uncertain environment for
business, have adverse implications for the financial sector and negative effects on the economy as a
whole. Risks are particularly significant for international banks and MTBs, given their reliance on the
international correspondent network to maintain multicurrency payments and settlements.



MTBs. While The Bahamas does not rely on remittances as a major source of foreign currency
income, termination of services could lead to an increase in the cost or interruption in
remittance outflows to other countries in the region. Overall remittance outflows average
about 1 percent of GDP in last three years (around $100 million), a small share of incoming
remittances in recipient countries (e.g. around 2.5 percent of total in Haiti and 0.4 percent in
Jamaica).

________________________________________________
1/ In an effort to better regulate the online gaming industry, “web-shops” that fulfilled regulatory requirements were issued
conditional licenses in November 2015. The Gaming Board, under the supervision of the Ministry of Tourism, has regulatory
oversight of the gaming industry (including both casinos and “web shops”).

Box 4. Loss of CBRs (Concluded)


Domestic banking system. While the dominance of Canadian banks, which have not been
directly impacted thus far, is likely to play an important stabilizing role for the domestic
banking system, additional loss of CBRs could lead to market concentration. Additional costs
from maintaining CBRs are likely to be transferred to final customers, leading to higher cost of
doing business and hampering access to financial services. Moreover, withdrawal of Canadian
banks could cause major disruptions in financial flows and trade finance.



Other risks. Further loss of CBRs or higher costs could encourage businesses to move into less
regulated parts of the financial system, contributing to the growth of an informal banking
system.

D. Other

Data and technical assistance. While data provision remains generally adequate for
surveillance, gaps remain in both coverage and timeliness, including in national accounts, public
sector accounts, and external accounts. Progress in addressing these data shortcomings has been
slow. Staff continues to support the authorities’ efforts, including continuing assistance with VAT
implementation; adoption of International Public Sector Accounting Standards (IPSAS) on an accrual
basis; strategic and medium–term budgeting, and compiling and publishing quarterly national
accounts and IIP statistics.

STAFF APPRAISAL
21.
Economic activity weighed down by weak domestic demand and challenges to
competitiveness. Real GDP growth stalled in 2015 as continued growth in air tourism arrivals was
not sufficient to offset weaker domestic demand, weighed down by headwinds from fiscal
consolidation as well as an end to construction and uncertainties over the opening of the Baha Mar
megaresort, and weaker goods exports. Looking ahead, real GDP growth is projected to increase
gradually as these headwinds moderate and to receive an additional, temporary boost when Baha
Mar opens.
22.
Fiscal consolidation helped by VAT introduction and progress in other revenue
reforms. Staff commends the authorities for the successful VAT introduction, which has made an
important contribution to maintaining macroeconomic stability and strengthening policy credibility.
Authorities should continue to resist pressures to introduce exemptions to the current broad-based
and efficient VAT regime and ensure continued strong implementation. Moving further towards a
fully-fledged central revenue agency and continuing modernization of customs and property tax
administration can further strengthen revenues. The authorities should also review the efficiency of
tax exemptions and concessions, including to the tourism sector, and consider simplifying domestic
taxes that are not business-friendly.
23.
Further consolidation critical for rebuilding fiscal and external policy buffers and
boosting investor confidence. In light of still rising government debt, further determined efforts
focusing on spending rationalization are needed to ensure fiscal sustainability. The authorities
INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

19

THE BAHAMAS

should contain increases in the public wage bill, extend SOE reform beyond the energy sector, and
advance on-going reforms to modernize the public financial management system. A shift in
composition towards growth-enhancing infrastructure spending and further intermediate steps
towards a medium-term budget framework would allow fiscal policy to better balance the need for
continued consolidation and support for the recovery. Finally, in the context of an ageing
population, the authorities should take measures to address increasing financial burden stemming
from the pension system.
24.
Mounting structural impediments call for a decisive shift towards implementation of
structural policies. Potential growth is estimated at only 1 to 1½ percent over the medium term,
total factor productivity growth is negative, and both youth and structural unemployment are too
high. To support near-term economic activity, staff sees room for shifting spending away from
current spending and towards more productive and growth-friendly infrastructure spending.
Priorities include efficient investment in information and communication technology, transportation,
public utilities, as well as projects that support economic diversification, increase domestic value
added in the dominant tourism sector and enhance resilience to natural disasters. Given that
structural reforms will take time to bear fruit, staff urges the authorities to implement reforms to
support priorities identified in the National Development Plan without delay. Reforms should aim to
strengthen the business environment, raise human capital and reduce skill mismatches, and reduce
high labor and energy costs. Given the exchange rate peg, improving competitiveness through
structural reforms would also avoid placing an excessive burden on fiscal policy and help build still
low international reserves.
25.
Addressing financial sector challenges. Renewed efforts to resolve the overhang of NPLs
are needed to spur credit growth. Staff welcomes recent progress in financial sector reforms,
including addressing gaps in the AML/CFT regulation and implementation of the new Basel II/III
regime, and encourages the authorities to continue strengthening risks-based supervision and
enhancing their framework for crisis management. Challenges from global “de-risking” trends call
for greater emphasis on risk-based financial sector supervision and regulation, strong efforts to
ensure compliance and close communication across stakeholders.
26.
It is proposed that the next Article IV consultation take place on the standard 12month cycle.

Annex I. Debt Sustainability Analysis
Central government debt has increased, reflecting weaker than expected fiscal stance and continued
low growth, but is expected to stabilize at 67 percent and decline gradually over the medium-term.
External financing requirement remains a significant risk to the debt profile, mitigated by the projected
strengthening of the current account in the medium term. Rising fiscal vulnerabilities underline the
need to implement staff recommendations, including resolute implementation of fiscal consolidation
and structural reforms to lift potential growth.
1.
Debt stock and gross financing requirements. Central government debt reached 64.4
percent of GDP in FY 2014/15, up by 4.2 percentage points owing to a weaker than expected fiscal
stance, continued low growth and high interest costs. Under the baseline scenario, staff projects
debt to peak at 67 percent of GDP in FY2016/17, higher than projected last year, and to gradually
fall to 64.4 percent over the medium term. As a result, gross financing requirement will decline from
8.4 percent of GDP in FY 2014/15 to about 3.2 percent of GDP. Ample liquidity in the domestic
banking system and a captive investor base will continue to ease rollover concerns.
2.
Debt profile and vulnerabilities. Despite continued increases in debt, its composition
remains favorable. A large proportion, 72 percent of total debt, is held in local currency. Short term
debt is only 12.7 percent of total debt and is denominated in local currency. The weighted average
time to maturity for the government’s domestic and external bonds are 9.6 and 16 years,
respectively. Overall, the heat map continues to point to low to moderate risks to debt sustainability.
Nevertheless, largely reflecting the still sizable current account deficit, external financing
requirement, which surpasses the benchmark for emerging market comparators, remains a
significant risk to the debt profile.
3.
Realism of baseline assumptions. Staff projects real growth to average 1.6 percent over
the medium term. Inflation is expected to remain low (1.6 percent), while the primary balance is
projected to gradually improve from a small deficit this year to a surplus of 1.7 percent at the end of
the forecast period. With respect to growth assumptions, there appears to be no systematic bias in
staff’s recent forecast, as projections have been close to the outcomes. Meanwhile, past projections
for primary balance appear to have been relatively optimistic, while inflation has turned out better
than expected. Staff does not view the historical primary balance as an appropriate comparator for
the projected primary balance path mainly because debt levels have generally been low in the past,
supported by stronger growth. Staff’s projected primary balance path is feasible, leaving room for
growth–enhancing expenditures, and is less ambitious than the path projected by the authorities.
4.
Macro–fiscal stress test. Shocks to the baseline macro–fiscal variables could moderately
worsen the debt path, and slightly raise the gross financing requirements. Real GDP growth shock
remains the most significant, and could push the debt to 73.6 percent of GDP at the end of the
projection period, compared with baseline projection of around 64.4 percent of GDP. Primary
balance and real interest rate shocks could raise debt to around 70 percent of GDP. Exposure to real
exchange rate shocks remains the least significant, with debt rising to 68 percent of GDP. Gross

financial requirements are, however, most sensitive to the real interest rate. A combined macro–
fiscal shock would raise debt to 78 percent of GDP, and gross financing requirements to 6.1 percent
of GDP in 2020/21.
5.
Adverse scenarios. Staff considered two approaches that assume worse macro–fiscal
outlook: (1) the constant primary balance and, (2) the historical average approaches. Under the first
approach, the primary balance is assumed to, over the medium term, stay at the projected level for
FY2015/16 (-0.1 percent of GDP), with the other variables, except the real effective interest rate,
remaining as they are in the baseline. In this scenario, debt will rise to 73.7 percent of GDP in
2020/21. Under the second approach, real GDP growth and the primary balance are assumed to stay
at 0.3 percent and -1.9 percent, respectively, from 2017 onwards. This second scenario indicates a
sharp further rise of the debt burden (to 91.8 percent of GDP) over the medium term with gross
financing requirements also rising to 9.3 percent of GDP. This reinforces the need for a steadfast
implementation of the fiscal consolidation program to achieve a more sustainable debt path.
6.
Natural disaster shock. A severe shock (calibrated based on the average sized–natural
disaster damage) that reduces baseline real GDP growth by 2.5 percent and 1.5 percent for 2017 and
2018, respectively, and worsens the primary balance by 1.25 percent and 0.75 percent of GDP over
the same period, would raise the debt level to 73.6 percent of GDP by 2021.
7.
Fiscal contingent liabilities. The analysis has focused on the central government sector due
to lack of consolidated general government and public sector data. Nonetheless, it is worth
mentioning that fiscal risks emanating from public entities and the public pension system (see
Annex II) are significant, and could further exacerbate the debt path if they materialize. Debt of
public entities amounted to 17.6 percent of GDP in 2014/15, of which 8.2 percent of GDP are
government guaranteed. The unfunded pension liabilities of the public pension system, amounts to
around $2.2 billion (about 26.2 percent of GDP), and in addition to the implicit debt of the social
security system, estimated at about 50 percent of GDP in 2015, are projected to grow further in the
next decades due to population aging.
8.
External debt. Estimated at 24.2 percent of GDP in 2014/15, external public debt, (central
government and public corporations) remains relatively low and is projected to stabilize at
22.3 percent over the projection horizon. The residual suggests that the private sector external debt
will continue to accumulate, albeit at a declining pace. Bound test results suggest that the external
public debt profile is moderately sensitive to shocks to the non-interest current account and the real
exchange rate.

Annex II. The Public Pension System—A Case for Reform
The Bahamas public pension system consists predominantly of partially funded and unfunded defined
benefit schemes. Pension obligations, already sizable, are expected to rise in the next two decades due
to population aging. Absent reform, the pension system will pose an increasing financial burden.

A. Government Pension Scheme
1.
Scheme. The government’s non–contributory scheme provides retirement pensions from
age 65 to eligible public officers—mainly direct government employees, the police and the defense
force—with at least 5 years of service (Table 1). Pension benefits vary. For officers in the general
public service, with tenure of 30 years, the retirement pension is 1/60 of pensionable earnings each
year, up to a maximum of 40 years.
2.
Costs and liabilities. Government pensioners (15 percent of the public work force) receive
pension payments from the budget that, on average, stood at 1 percent of GDP and 7.3 percent of
tax revenue per year in 1994–2014. The accrued pension liabilities totaled B$1.5 billion in 20121
(17.9 percent of GDP). Pension payments and liabilities are projected to reach B$230million
(1.5 percent of GDP) and B$3.7 billion (24 percent of GDP), respectively by 2030.

B. Public Entities Pension Scheme
3.
Schemes. Most public entities have non–contributory schemes, separate from that of the
government and the National Insurance Scheme (NIS). The benefit structure and eligibility
requirements are different across entities, perhaps reflecting negotiation with unions, the absence of
national pension regulation and limited government oversight. The schemes provide benefits to
retirees from age 60, at 2 percent of their pensionable earnings, up to a maximum of 40 years. A few
entities, however, have introduced defined contribution pension especially for new employees.
4.
Costs and liabilities. Key entities are estimated to spend a combined B$12 million annually,
representing partial, advanced funding of accruing pensions. Their combined pension shortfall–
unfunded component of future pensions2– amounted to B$0.7billion (8.3 percent of GDP). Pension
cost, reportedly a drain on most entities’ cash flow, also impacts their viability, due to limited
resources left for productive capital spending. Entities such as the Water and Sewerage Corporation
(WSC), Bahamasair, and Bahamas Electricity Corporation (BEC) continue to record financial losses as
a result of their public service mandates, operational inefficiencies and inadequate regulatory
framework. Reflecting aged facilities and generous employment policies, their operating cost are
noted to be particularly high while tariffs remain low, necessitating continued budget support, which
amounted to B$116.8 million (1.4 percent of GDP) in FY2014/15. Moreover, the pace of public

Scheme. The National Insurance Scheme (NIS), the backbone of social protection, offers a
contributory, partially funded, pay-as-you go (PAYG) old–age pension, covering 70 percent of the
labor force, and financed by payroll taxes paid by employers and employees.

as a result of low growth, high unemployment, relatively low contribution rate, and compliance
issues, the income from contributions (2.7 percent of GDP) can no longer finance total expenditure
(3.3 percent of GDP). Beyond 2033, the scheme is projected to run operational deficits as it matures.

High administrative costs. At the same time, as highlighted by the 2011 actuarial report,
the NIS administrative costs are high, equivalent to about one–quarter of contributions in 2013,
mostly reflecting increasing staff size, its relatively large role, operational inefficiencies, and the
difficulties of rendering social services in the archipelago.6

D. Options for Reform
9.
Pension reform is inevitable. Staff analysis indicates that a parametric reform that raises
the contribution rate by 1 percent, freezes pension benefits for two years, and raises the retirement
rate from 65 to 67 years, if implemented together, will nearly wipe out the NIS implicit debt,
estimated at 49 percent in 2015, and put the pension scheme on a sound financial footing.7 Table 3
provides a menu of policy recommendations for the different pension schemes. The authorities
should begin to take steps to implement policies that would contain increases in pension costs, and
over the medium, gradually phase in more far-reaching reforms.

average age of direct government employees was 43 in 2013.

The NIS has 579 employees in up to 20 locations across The Bahamas, and performs numerous functions, including
registration, collection of contributions, and the administration of various benefits. It will begin registration of
beneficiaries under the soon-to-be launched government’s National Health Insurance.

THE BAHAMAS

Annex III. External Sector Assessment
The Bahamas external accounts are characterized by persistent current account deficits that are mostly
financed by FDI and other private inflows, and in recent years, by public borrowing. While the
estimates point to significant uncertainty in assessing the external position, overall, they suggest that
the external position is weaker than suggested by fundamentals and desirable policy settings. While
the CFM regime in place substantially reduces risks, the country would benefit from additional reserves
accumulation, given its exposure to external shocks and natural disasters, and increased reliance on
more volatile non-FDI capital flows in recent years. With the well-established currency peg, efforts to
improve competitiveness through structural reforms, accompanied by fiscal consolidation are needed
to address these vulnerabilities.

A. Exchange Rate Assessment
1.
Model-based estimates. Model-based estimates point to an external position that is
weaker than suggested by fundamentals and desirable policy settings. Uncertainty across the
estimates is substantial, as reflected in the range of estimates from 10.7 to 31.3 percent.
2.
EBA-lite results. Both the EBA-lite CA and REER approaches point to an overvalued REER in
2015 (see Table).1 The EBA-lite REER regression approach, which has a better fit than the CA
regression approach, suggests that the real rate is 10.7 percent stronger than the level consistent
with fundamentals and desired policies. The assessment using the CA regression approach is based
on an adjusted CA deficit to account for country-specific circumstances and additional temporary
factors. Specifically, the 2015 CA deficit is driven in part by sizeable, but one-off, imports related to
construction of the Baha Mar resort (which was halted in the first half of the year) and a significant
share of other imports that are funded by stable FDI related inflows. Adjusting for these factors, as
well as potential tourism revenue from Baha Mar opening (together estimated at around 7.1 percent
of GDP) reduces the estimated cyclically adjusted CA deficit to 8.2 percent of GDP. The CA approach
norm is estimated at -1.2 percent of GDP, therefore pointing to a sizeable REER gap of 31.3 percent.
In this context, the limitations of the approach are also reflected in a persistently poor fit of the
panel CA estimation for small, tourismExchange Rate Assessment

The external sustainability approach is not used owing to lack of official net international investment position data.
The EBA-lite CA approach uses an estimate of the NFA position derived from incomplete data available in updated
and extended version of the Lane and Milesi-Ferretti (2007) dataset: “External Wealth of Nations”. Given the small
elasticity for NFA in the CA regression results are not sensitive to alternative estimates.

3.
Macroeconomic Balance (MB) approach. Given the large range of estimates from the EBAlite methods and apparent methodological weaknesses (in particular as regards the use of the CA
regression approach), we also employ an additional regression based MB approach to assess
external sustainability. As opposed to the EBA-lite CA regression approach, the MB approach
appropriately accounts for the fact that the CA deficit is expected to narrow significantly over the
medium term, reflecting both low oil prices and higher tourism revenue generated by Baha Mar
opening, therefore pointing to less REER misalignment (see Table). Analysis using this approach
suggests that the CA deficit is about 5 percentage points larger than the norm, implying a REER gap
of 16.6 percent.
4.
REER has been appreciating. The REER has been appreciating since end 2014, at an
increased pace starting in March 2015, in line with the appreciation of the US dollar relative to other
currencies (see Figure). The pace of REER appreciation over the last year was comparable to several
other Caribbean countries (notable Barbados and the ECCU), but noticeably faster than in countries
with more flexible exchange rate arrangements (Jamaica and the Dominican Republic). The current
level of the REER is around 11 percent higher than

appreciated much less over the past year.
5.
Other indicators. Estimates of the “Week at the Beach” index indicate that the nominal
costs of an average one week beach holiday in The Bahamas are already among the highest in the
world.2 Although the country remains an attractive high end tourism destination, its share in the
Caribbean tourism market that focuses on more exclusive tourism experience has been declining.
The World Bank’s Doing Business Index places The Bahamas well behind the regional; average, at
106th place among 148 countries. While the country marginally improved its rating since last year,
the overall position has significantly deteriorated over last seven years, further increasing the
economy’s distance to frontiers and best performers. A closer look at Doing Business sub-indicators
suggests that The Bahamas performs particularly poorly in registering property, getting credit,
starting a business, and protecting minority investors.

B. Reserve Adequacy
6.
Overall assessment. Reserves appear to be adequate according to several metrics, but low
when taking into account small island specific factors, such as exposure to external shocks and
natural disasters. Strengthening external accounts through structural reforms that will improve

business climate and competitiveness, together with continued fiscal consolidation, should therefore
be a priority.
Reserve adequacy metrics. International reserves stood at US$981 million at end-March
2015 and are below traditional international benchmarks of 3 months of next year’s goods and
services imports and 20 percent of broad money. However, adjusting for FDI-related imports,
reserves are more than 3 months of imports. They are also well above 100 percent of short term
debt. The Fund’s standard risk-weighted measure, which attempts to measure the benefit of
reserves in avoiding crises and in reducing their severity, requires coverage against medium and
long-term external liabilities, in addition to coverage of short-term debt and broad money. The
results indicate that current reserves are at around 72 percent of the suggested level. However, the
existence of capital controls both on residents, and certain types on nonresident outflows, continues
to be an important mitigating factor.3 Accounting for these county-specific factors, the revised riskweighted measure shows that reserves appear to be adequate. Still, the country has been increasing
its reliance on private capital inflows other than stable FDI inflows, and on sovereign bond issuance,
suggesting increasing risks from shifts in investor sentiment. The framework proposed by Mwase
(2012) further takes into account specifics of small island states and their exposure to natural
disasters.4 In the case of The Bahamas, this measure (SIDS) indicates that reserves are only at 45
percent of the recommended level.

With the exception of 2009, when they briefly fell to zero, net portfolio investment and other private capital flows
have always been positive, thus supporting reserves. All outward capital transfers require Exchange Control approval,
and outflows on resident-owned capital are restricted. In principle, inward investment in shares and other securities
by nonresident is unrestricted. However, the Central Bank approval is required for the sale and issuance of capital
and money market instruments on nonresidents locally.

Exchange Rate Arrangement
The Bahamas has a conventional fixed peg arrangement, with the Bahamian dollar pegged to
the U.S. dollar at B$1 per US$1. The Bahamas has accepted the obligations of Article VIII, Sections
2, 3, and 4 of the Articles of Agreement and maintains an exchange system that is free of restrictions
on the making of payments and transfers for current international transactions. There have been no
changes in exchange restrictions since the last Article IV consultation.

Assessment of Data Adequacy for Surveillance:
Data provision is broadly adequate for surveillance. In particular, all critical macroeconomic data,
including comprehensive central government finance statistics, are regularly published in the Central
Bank of the Bahamas’ “Monthly Economic and Financial Developments” and “Quarterly Statistical
Digest”. However, the authorities have yet to develop the institutional capacity for the compilation of
international investment position (IIP) statistics and general government accounts data. Also, The
Bahamas has still not started compiling balance of payments statistics consistent with the Balance of
Payments Manual 6. Staff continues to support the authorities’ efforts towards addressing data gaps,
including continuing technical assistance to compile and publish quarterly national accounts and IIP
statistics.
Last Article IV Consultation
The Bahamas is on a 12-month consultation cycle. The last Article IV consultation was concluded by
the Executive Board on June 8, 2015 (IMF Country Report No. 15/75).

Country Strategy with The Bahamas 2013–2017
The current Country Strategy supports the Government of The Bahamas (GoBH) efforts to
ensure macroeconomic sustainability, social stability and employment, while focusing on
resilience to mitigate the negative impact of natural disasters and climate change. The Bank is:
(i) supporting the implementation of fiscal and debt sustainability reforms with an impact on public
finances and public financial management; (ii) assisting with fostering social cohesion, with an
emphasis on preventing crime and violence and strengthening the criminal justice system; (iii)
assisting with modernizing the electricity sector and diversification of the energy matrix; (iv)
facilitating diversification of both the economy and trading partners by enhancing areas of
comparative advantage and removing constraints to private sector activity; and (v) building
resilience to natural disasters through improved coastal zone management, incorporating disaster
risk reduction and climate change adaptation measures in development planning, control and

monitoring. The support is focused on the following priority areas: (1) Public Finances and
Management; (2) Citizen Security and Justice; (3) Energy; (4) Private Sector Development; and
(5) Coastal Risk Management and Climate Change Adaptation. Interventions will contribute to
stemming the erosion of per capita incomes by protecting public investment and promoting growth.
Efforts are made to generate non-sovereign guaranteed (NSG) lending that is closely aligned to the
development and diversification of the private sector, as well as direct financing for alternative
energy and energy efficiency. In addition, the IDB aims to support interventions in sectors where
additional financial and non-financial resources may be leveraged.
Other areas for future dialogue. In addition to the priority areas identified above, the Bank is
supporting diagnostic and analytical work in the following dialogue areas: (a) Education: The
provision of quality education services: (i) via strengthening capacity at the secondary education
level to improve the transition from school to work, including potential areas for PPPs, and (ii) for
special needs children and youth at all levels of the educational system and with an emphasis on the
transition from school to work; (b) Food Security: Analyzing options to increase domestic food
production and consumption of local goods, given the country’s heavy dependence on food
imports; (c) Transport: An analysis of (i) the impact and opportunities from the completion of the
Panama Canal, (ii) greater connectivity: how inter-island mobility could be made more efficient
across the 28 inhabited islands; (iii) enhancing trade links with the rest of the Caribbean and Latin
America; and (d) Informal Immigration.

FINANCIAL RELATIONS WITH THE CARIBBEAN
DEVELOPMENT BANK
(As of April, 2016)
Country Strategy with The Bahamas 2013─2017
The overriding aim of the CDB’s current Strategy for The Bahamas is to support the country’s
advancement as a progressively stable and vibrant economy, as well as an increasingly safe society
with enhanced opportunities for productive employment and improved living standards. An
indicative programme of assistance was proposed to help the country achieve faster, more inclusive
and environmentally sustainable development, buttressed by macroeconomic stability and citizen
security. The Country Strategy responds to The Bahamas’ development priorities and is aligned with
the Bank’s strategic objectives of fostering inclusive social development and promoting broadbased economic growth, as well as environmental sustainability. The Bank is supporting six
development priorities: (i) improved access to, and quality of climate-resilient social and economic
infrastructure; (ii) enhanced access to quality, and demand-driven post-secondary and tertiary
education; (iii) increased social inclusion and citizen security; (iv) strengthened productive and
managerial capacities of micro, small and medium-sized enterprises; (v) improved public finances
and planning; and (vi) strengthened resilience to climate change and improved disaster risk
management (DRM). A number of projects, along with associated technical assistance, are being
taken forward to address these priorities.
Other areas for future dialogue: The Bank has already conducted a mid-term review of the
existing strategy, with a view to shaping the rest of the strategy period, and thinking about the next,
which is due to start in 2018. Discussions are likely to focus on consolidating the work of the
existing strategy, with particular focus on the development needs in the Family Islands.

STATISTICAL ISSUES
Statistical data are broadly adequate for surveillance purposes, but some weaknesses remain
in both coverage and timeliness, partly reflecting capacity constraints. The central bank
produces annual, quarterly, and monthly reports on macroeconomic developments, and monetary
and fiscal data, and is the main source of economic information. The operations of public

8

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

THE BAHAMAS

corporations are not compiled into a consolidated set of public sector accounts, although their debt
is included in the public debt data. Thus, a presentation of the general government accounts,
including revenue, expenditure, and overall balance is not available.
In March 2015, the Department of Statistics (DoS) updated the CPI methodology with technical
assistance from CARTAC. Using the results of the 2013 Household Expenditure Survey, it revised the
CPI weights to 2013 from 2006 and changed the base period to November 2014 from February 2010.
The coverage was expanded to include new local and foreign items reflecting current expenditures
by households. New sample outlets were also introduced to reflect those that are frequently visited
by Households.
The DoS continues to develop the Export-Import Price Indices (XMPIs) to meet international
standards. CARTAC missions have assisted in compiling the XMPIs, including Tourism Services Price
Index (TSPI) on quarterly basis. New XMPIs for goods and major services have been developed,
while procedures for systematic re-sampling and re-weighting were modified in order to keep the
market basket representative of what is being measured. The DoS is also receiving technical
assistance from CARTAC to produce quarterly GDP estimates, and they are expecting to start
publishing quarterly data in October 2016. The Bahamas does not prepare data covering the
economy-wide external debt position, nor an international investment position (IIP), although they
have stated their intention to do so. In August 2014, a CARTAC mission advised the authorities on
the requirements for transitioning to Balance of Payments Manual 6 (BMP6) and disseminating
statistics on the IIP. The mission noted that most of the conversion from BPM5 to BPM6 is
straightforward and some of the data required, such as reserve assets and public sector debt, are
already available. However, the authorities will need to collect new data on the nonbank private
sector. Capacity constraints at the Central Bank have led to little progress in this project. The
authorities plan to start publishing BPM6 statistics in September 2016 and IIP statistics in
March 2017.
The Inter-American Development Bank (IDB), with the technical support of the United States Census
Bureau (USCB), has promoted the development of a methodology called “Tool for Assessing
Statistical Capacity” (TASC). This is a self-assessment instrument, the general purpose of which is
measuring and evaluating the statistical capacity of a country’s National Statistical System (NSS),
and more specifically, the operational capacity of its National Statistical Office (NSO), to produce
and disseminate basic statistics drawn from censuses, surveys and administrative records. There was
a mission to The Bahamas to meet with the Department of Statistics and other agencies that
produce statistics to apply the TASC in late November, 2013. As part of the statistical component of
the IDB’s Public Financial Management reform program (PFM) with the government, the TASC
assessment will be applied again to assess how things have evolved since 2013.
The Bahamas began participating in the General Data Dissemination System (GDDS) in 2003. Its
metadata were posted on the Fund’s Dissemination Standards Bulletin Board on February 14, 2003.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

Statement by the Staff Representative on The Bahamas
June 8, 2016

1.
This statement provides new information that has become available since the
issuance of the staff report (SM/16/110). The additional information does not change the
thrust of the staff appraisal.
2.
Budget communication. Prime Minister Christie presented the 2016/17 fiscal year
budget to Parliament on May 25. For the current 2015/16 fiscal year (ending this June), the
government expects the fiscal deficit at B$150 million, broadly consistent with the earlier
budget projection (at B$141 million, about 1.5 percent of GDP). Compared to the budget
projection, the somewhat larger deficit reflects lower revenue (despite strong VAT
performance), higher current spending (including additional tourism concession payments),
and lower capital spending. The government’s fiscal deficit estimate remains lower than
staff’s expectation primarily owing to more optimistic revenue projections and lower than
budgeted capital expenditure.
3.
The 2016/17 budget. The budget proposes further deficit reduction next year (to
$100million, or about 1.1 percent of GDP) that is expected to arrest the recent increase in
public debt. At this pace, the authorities’ project the central government debt-to-GDP ratio to
fall below 60 percent by 2018/19. The budget proposes “relief to consumers and businesses”
through reductions in customs duties and tax concessions, as well as continued measures to
modernize tax administration. The budget communication also outlines several new policy
initiatives, including a training program for the unemployed; a mortgage relief program; and
support for the loss-making Bank of The Bahamas, in line with the priorities identified in the
staff report. As a part of the budget communication, the government also announced a
framework agreement to finance and complete construction of the Baha Mar resort.

Statement by Michael McGrath, Alternate Executive Director for The Bahamas
and Rebekah Young, Senior Advisor
June 8, 2016

The Bahamian authorities continue to value greatly the policy dialogue with the Fund. They
welcome the thorough assessment of the country’s economic situation and financial system
made by the Article IV mission and broadly agree with this assessment. The report outlines a
sensible set of policy options, for the most part in line with initiatives already in train or
envisioned by our authorities.
The Outlook
Economic conditions in The Bahamas remain subdued. Preliminary estimates for 2015
suggest a contraction of 1.7 percent of GDP. The modest growth in tourism was offset by a
contraction in domestic demand and weak goods exports, fueled by headwinds from fiscal
consolidation, introduction of the VAT, and the wind-up of construction activities related to
the Baha Mar.
Growth is expected to pick up modestly in 2016 by around 0.5 percent of GDP, driven by
modest growth in the tourism sector and foreign investment related to the construction sector.
Economic activity thereafter is projected to strengthen further in 2017 to an annual rate of 1
percent in real terms.
A number of new investment projects coming on stream in the near term have the potential to
boost growth, lower unemployment, and enhance competitiveness. Notably, our authorities
are confident that the Baha Mar resort, which is 97 percent complete, will open shortly. This
new, high-end resort is expected to add 2,200 rooms to the country’s stock of over 14,000.
Additionally, a relatively strong level of foreign investment projects in both New Providence
and across the archipelago should sustain aggregate demand in the short run, boost the
tourism productive capacity, and lead to a much-needed increase in economic activity and
employment creation once these projects come fully on stream.
As growth solidifies, the unemployment rate should gradually decline from its current level
of 14.8 percent (November). By itself, the Baha Mar project should employ at steady state
more than 5,000 employees. This is expected to reduce significantly the unemployment rate,
increase disposable income, and support domestic demand.
While our authorities broadly agree with the medium-term outlook and risk profile, they are
cautiously optimistic on the upside potential. For example, while our authorities
acknowledge that a further surge in the U.S. dollar could weaken cost competitiveness of The
Bahamas, the country stands to gain from increased trade and tourism with the U.S., provided
the surge is underpinned by improving U.S. economic prospects. Cuba is not perceived as a
significant competitor in the medium term, particularly given The Bahamas’ high-end target
market, rather it could yield synergies through enhanced collaboration in the region. Our

2
authorities also view persistently low oil prices as an upside risk as it would reduce the value
of imports and could help smooth the transition of the energy sector reforms.
Ensuring Fiscal Sustainability
The Bahamian authorities recognize the importance of responsible fiscal policy to
maintaining macroeconomic stability and policy credibility. They reaffirm their commitment
to firmly staying the course with their Medium-Term Fiscal Consolidation Plan, including
through continued fiscal consolidation to place public debt on a declining path and rebuild
buffers. They are on target to meet their 2015/16 fiscal deficit target of 1.5 percent, with a
further reduction in 2016/17 to 1.1 percent, as announced in the recent the 2016/17 Budget
Communication on May 25th. They expect to eliminate the deficit and to achieve a small
balance by 2018/19. The central government debt to GDP ratio is expected to stabilize at 67
percent of GDP by 2016/17 and begin to decline thereafter to about 59 percent in 2018/19.
This will be achieved by continued restraint of public expenditures, enhanced revenue
administration, and securing new sources of revenue, as well as continued efforts to stimulate
overall economic growth.
Our authorities have demonstrated credible progress towards consolidation. The successful
introduction of the VAT in 2015 was a significant achievement and will contribute to the
long-term macroeconomic stability of the country. Revenue collection exceeded expectations
and, taken together with other reforms, should raise additional revenues of 2.5 percent of
GDP, bringing the total revenue yield to a respectable 22.5 percent of GDP this year. Our
authorities are intent on protecting the integrity and efficiency of the VAT regime by
resisting pressures to introduce distortionary exemptions. They view targeted social spending
as a more effective means to assist low-income populations, and have already raised
minimum wage and increased social spending to this end.
Our authorities are continuing with revenue administration reforms that will yield significant
additional revenue. These include a number of targeted reforms, for example to customs,
business license and real property taxes, as well as modernization measures, including the
successful introduction of electronic filing of customs import declarations and online
payment of customs duties. These measures lower the cost and increase the ease of doing
business, while providing stronger controls over the collection of government revenue. The
modernization of the property tax management system is expected to be concluded over the
course of upcoming fiscal year. This a significant advance under the mandate of the
centralized revenue administration (Department of Inland Revenue). Our authorities are also
taking steps to modernize their public financial management system, including through
revamped accounting systems and other budget reforms.
Our authorities recognize the importance of expenditure reforms in fiscal consolidation. In
the recent Budget Communication, they project at least a 1 percent of GDP reduction in
recurrent expenditures per year beyond the coming fiscal year. They recognize this will take
discipline. For example, they will accommodate for fiscal costs related to Hurricane Joaquin
through spending reallocation, amounting to $100 million (1.1 percent of GDP) over several
years. They also recognize the need to be mindful of fiscal constraints in rolling out the

3
National Health Insurance, and they will soon commence public consultation on pension
reform, including on options to move to a defined contribution-based regime.
Maintaining External Sector Sustainability
Inflation has been tempered at 1.9 percent in 2015. While the introduction of the VAT
resulted in some temporary upward pressure, this has been moderated by low oil prices. This
is allowing monetary policy to remain supportive while maintaining the fixed exchange rate
which has been instrumental in reducing uncertainty for foreign investors and providing a
credible nominal anchor.
The current account deficit has come down modestly to 7 percent of GDP. The level of
reserves has increased to US$980.5 million at the end of March, up significantly by about
$172 million since December 2015. These levels remain adequate when measured in terms of
non-FDI imports and other standard metrics, and are expected to improve through growth in
tourism earnings and foreign direct investment, together with reforms that will facilitate
stable and organic accumulation of reserves.
Strengthening Financial Sector Resilience
The Bahamian banking system remains well capitalized, profitable, and liquid. Our
authorities have made steady progress in implementing financial sector reforms identified in
the 2013 FSAP, including further strengthening of the regulatory and supervisory framework,
reporting under the U.S. Foreign Accounts Tax Compliance Act (FATCA), and
implementation of the new Basel II/III regime. A consulting firm has also been engaged by a
state-owned bank to develop and implement a rehabilitation plan, which should improve
governance, revise its market focus, strengthen its risk management, and enforce collection.
Our authorities recognize the need for decisive and timely resolution of non-performing loans
(NPLs). They note that banks have been more aggressive in writing off and provisioning for
bad debts, as well as proactively implementing policies to provide relief or restructuring
options to distressed customers. Our authorities are also working with banks to develop a
new framework for mortgage relief that will impact significantly more homeowners than the
previous program without unduly burdening the budget or rewarding poor lending practices.
They expect to release details of this new Mortgage Relief Programme during the
forthcoming budget debates, through which an estimated 1,000 delinquent borrowers are
expected to initially qualify. Our authorities remain committed to addressing any remaining
gaps that will ensure financial stability.
De-Risking
Our authorities recognize the challenges stemming from global de-risking trends, which are
affecting a number of countries in the region, including The Bahamas. While affected
institutions have been able to avoid significant disruptions, our authorities are committed to
proactively addressing any concerns. They continue to monitor the industry, provide
assistance to banks, and are encouraging them to take a risk-based approach and to work on

4
any remaining regulatory gaps. Our authorities will also continue to coordinate with regional
counterparts to mitigate any adverse economic fallout. With a strong overall AML/CFT
regime in place, our authorities are seeking greater clarity on regulatory expectations and
requirements from international banks and from source jurisdictions. They are strongly
committed to promptly addressing gaps or concerns as they may arise.
Fostering Growth and Competitiveness
The Bahamian authorities are very mindful of the need to boost potential growth, enhance
productivity and bolster competitiveness. They afford high priority to the finalization of the
National Development Plan (NDP), which will help accelerate economic, institutional, and
social development over the medium and long term. The April ‘State of the Nation Report’
was an important milestone in the first phase of the NDP, providing an in-depth diagnostic of
The Bahamian economy and society. While extensive, non-partisan consultations on the
NDP have taken considerable time, this inclusive approach will be critical to gaining
consensus for implementation. A first draft of the NDP is expected to be released in the
coming months for further consultation.
Our authorities recognize the importance of improving the business environment to
strengthen competitiveness, including through reliable and affordable energy costs. This
would also help facilitate economic diversification. To this end, important steps have been
taken, including the introduction of legislation to reform the Bahamas Electricity Corporation
(BEC). Its management has recently been outsourced to a private sector company,
PowerSecure International (US), with a mandate to operate on a fully commercial basis,
which should bring down costs and resolve power supply problems to the benefit of tourism
and other sectors. It should also end uncertainties that have prevented long-term investment
needed to expand generation capacity, improve the distribution network, and reduce the cost
of power.
The authorities strongly agree with the need for continuous improvement of efficiency and
transparency of operations of other state-owned enterprises (SOEs), not only to minimize the
budget implications but to lower costs and improve services to customers. They expect to
achieve significant milestones in introducing competition in the cellular market in the coming
weeks. At the same time, they note the challenges associated with providing uniform and
affordable services to all islands in the archipelago, given the high cost and low scope for
economies of scale.
Our authorities remain committed to raising human capital through educational and
vocational reforms to lower unemployment and raise potential growth. Legislation has
recently been finalized for the establishment of the University of The Bahamas. This will
complement other recent secondary educational reforms, including strengthened standards
for school graduates and the introduction of STAR Academy targeting vulnerable children.
Significant efforts are underway to also strengthen work force training including through the
establishment of the National Training Agency. The government announced on May 25th, an
additional $22 million to complement last year’s $20 million in support of an apprenticeship
program in partnership with the private sector under which employers will be incentivized,

5
through a wage subsidy, to employ young persons in positions that will afford them the
opportunity to acquire basic job skills.
