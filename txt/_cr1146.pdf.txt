INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND
TUVALU
Staff Report for the 2010 Article IV Consultation1
Prepared by Staff Representatives for the 2010 Consultation with Tuvalu
Approved by Ray Brooks and Thomas Dorsey
January 12, 2011
Key Issues and Recommendations:

1



Context: Tuvalu became the Fund’s 187th member in June 2010. Despite its geographic
remoteness, Tuvalu has not been immune to the global financial crisis. Economic
activity has been dampened by lower offshore earnings. The government continued to
increase spending to support the economy, which resulted in a sharp decline in the fund
available for budget financing.



Growth prospects: The economy is expected to have almost no growth in 2010, and
growth is projected to be zero or even turn negative in 2011, led by lower government
spending, and remain low over the medium term. The outlook is subject to risks related
to a delay in fiscal adjustment and the pace of the global recovery.



Focus: Discussions focused on the fiscal adjustments required to avoid looming
problems and ensure fiscal sustainability over the longer term. The policy options are
limited. The government needs to take immediate action to cut spending and increase
tax compliance. It also should strengthen fiscal management by saving windfall revenue,
using a medium-term budget framework, and improving budget reporting and analysis.



External stability: The use of the Australian dollar as its currency is appropriate. Exports
are minimal and the country depends highly on imports given almost no domestic
production base except subsistence farming and fishing. Fiscal adjustment will be key to
maintaining external stability.

Discussions took place in Funafuti and Suva during November 11– 23, 2010, with Prime Minister
Maatia Toafa, Finance Minister Monise Laafai, Permanent Secretary of Finance Minute Taupo, other
senior officials, representatives of the private sector, and donors. The team also contacted new
Finance Minister Lotoala Metia to discuss fiscal policy after the new government was formed on
December 24, 2010. The team comprised Mr. Jang (head), Ms. Bouza, Mr. Mohommad (all APD),
Mr. Merrick, Ms. Pan (both World Bank), and Mr. Lototele (Asian Development Bank). Ms. Tira
(OED) also participated in the meetings.

I. INTRODUCTION
1.
Economic setting. Economic performance has been volatile in recent years and
largely determined by offshore earnings

the basic needs of its population, with
access to basic health services and
formal education almost universal. Climate change looms as a major challenge in light of
rising sea levels.
2.
Politics. A new government was formed in late December after the previous
government formed in late September 2010 was brought down through a motion of no
confidence by eight votes to seven. There are no organized political parties in Tuvalu. The
government is preparing the 2011 budget, which is expected to be discussed in Parliament in
March.
II. RECENT DEVELOPMENTS
3.
Growth and inflation. Despite its geographic remoteness, Tuvalu has not been
immune to the global financial crisis. Even with higher government spending, staff estimates
zero growth in GDP in 2010, after the economy contracted by about 2 percent in 2009
(Table 1 and Figure 2). Major construction projects to build a wharf and a power station have
been completed, and seafarer employment—Tuvalu’s main foreign exchange earning source

for the private sector—is weak. Moreover, the Tuvalu Cooperative Society (the main
wholesaler and retailer in Tuvalu) is facing difficult financial conditions so the government
extended debt guarantees equivalent to 1½ percent of GDP. Annual inflation has been
negative since mid-2009 (-1¾ percent in November 2010) due to lower global food prices
and the strong Australian dollar.
4.
Fiscal performance. In response to the global crisis, the government continued to
support the economy by increasing spending. Parliament passed three supplementary
appropriation bills in 2010, totaling about 10 percent of GDP to pay government-guaranteed
debt for an airline company and increase capital spending. The fiscal deficit is estimated to
increase sharply from 4 percent of GDP in 2009 to almost 30 percent of GDP in 2010 owing
to weak domestic revenue and offshore income and increased spending (Table 2). As a result,
the fund available for budget financing has declined rapidly to about 20 percent of GDP from
45 percent in 2009.
5.
Public debt. Tuvalu’s public debt has declined in the last two years, but remains high
by regional standards at about 44 percent of GDP. The Asian Development Bank (ADB)
provided grants to clear part of domestic debt and part of the EIB loan was converted to a
grant in 2009. External public debt is at over 30 percent of GDP, but mostly on concessional
terms, resulting in low debt servicing obligations. The government might have an additional
external debt of US$10 million (about 30 percent of GDP) relating to joint ventures with
foreign fishing companies.
6.
Financial sector. The financial
sector is underdeveloped and lending
constrained, following rapid credit
growth in the early 2000s (Table 3).
Nonperforming loans are high at around
40 percent of total loans. The banking
sector consists of the National Bank of
Tuvalu (NBT) and one development
bank, both of which are government
owned.2 The Tuvalu National Provident
Fund (TNPF) also provides its members
with loans, for which each member’s
account is used as collateral.3 Interest

The NBT performs some monetary functions, including the holding of government accounts and foreign assets.

The TNPF has about 6,800 members, more than half of the total population, and its total assets amounted to
97 percent of GDP ($A34 million) at end-2009. The TNPF’s total loans to its members were about 20 percent of
its total assets at end-2009 and the remaining assets were invested abroad. Starting September 2009, all
employees are required to contribute 13 percent of their salaries, including for the new medical and educational
saving scheme, and employers contribute 10 percent of employees’ salaries.

5
rates on lending have changed little in recent years, reflecting limited competition in the
financial system.
7.
External position. Staff estimates a current account deficit of almost 25 percent of
GDP in 2010 due to low income and grants (Table 4). Tuvalu exports little and depends
heavily on imports. Gross official reserves, including the SDR allocation, have declined
substantially in 2010, but still remain high at about eight months of imports of goods and
services.
8.
Public enterprises. Most public enterprises are financially weak. 4 Only the NBT
remains profitable, while three public enterprises have not been profitable in the last several
years. The total debt of the sector, excluding the two banks, rose from 19 percent of GDP in
2004 to 42 percent in 2007, part of which is guaranteed by the government. Very low tariff
structures, government arrears, and structural inefficiencies are the major impediments to
sound balance sheets. Furthermore, limited availability of experienced managers and Board
structures chaired by civil servants have reduced the prospects for public enterprises to
operate on a sound commercial footing.
III. OUTLOOK AND RISKS
9.
Outlook. The growth outlook remains clouded. The weak global recovery would not
increase remittances and investment income substantially. Given the difficult fiscal situation,

Risks. On the domestic front, the fund available for budget financing could be
depleted in 2011 without fiscal adjustment, which may force a big, sudden cut in government
spending and a sharp decline in growth. On the external front, the main risk is that a weaker
external environment would spill into Tuvalu through investment income and remittances
channels. Moreover, Tuvalu is vulnerable to natural disasters and climate change will be a
major challenge in light of rising sea levels. 5
11.
Authorities’ views. The authorities shared the mission’s assessment of the economy
and growth prospects. They indicated that they are aware of the difficult fiscal situation,
which was presented to community leaders at a conference on the Millennium Development
Goals in November 2010.
IV. POLICY DISCUSSIONS
A. Fiscal Policy
12.
Developments. The large spending increases in the last few years have resulted in a
sharp increase in the fiscal deficit in 2010, as offshore revenue and grants fell to earlier levels.
The large deficit has led to a rapid decline in the fund (CIF) available for budget financing.
Total spending relative to GDP has increased by 20 percentage points since 2005, mainly due
to sharp increases in subsidies, transfers and capital spending. Subsidies and transfers to
households and public enterprises have risen to 25 percent of GDP in 2010, an increase of
more than 10 percentage points of GDP over the last three years.

compliance, particularly for the
consumption tax, which was introduced in
mid-2009 as part of the tax reforms. Many taxpayers did not submit returns for the
consumption tax since they are unfamiliar with this tax.
14.
Longer-term adjustments. Staff stressed that further adjustments would be required
over the medium term to ensure fiscal sustainability. The government has not tapped the TTF
since its inception in 1987, which is key to fiscal discipline and maintaining the real value of
the TTF over the long term to provide an ongoing source of financing. Tax administration
needs to be strengthened to increase domestic revenue to earlier levels. The government also
should aim to bring down total spending further to more sustainable levels (about the 2005–
6

In years when the market value of the TTF exceeds its targeted value (which is linked to the Australian CPI),
the surplus is distributed into the Consolidated Investment Fund (CIF) and is available for budgetary spending.
As of September 2010, the TTF’s market value was $A107 million compared with the targeted value of
$A119 million. Since 2008, the TTF’s market value has been below its targeted value.

08 level) and come up with a longer-term plan to rebuild the CIF to its targeted balance
(16 percent of the TTF’s maintained value). Implementing sound fiscal policy would also be
necessary to build fiscal space to respond to natural disasters and the impact of climate
change.

Risks. Staff noted that a weaker global recovery would require additional fiscal
adjustments. The proposed medium-term adjustment scenario assumes that the TTF’s market
value would increase by an annual real growth rate of 5½ percent, which is somewhat below
the average real rate of return of 6¼ percent over the last

scenario would result in a financing gap of about

19.5
11 percent of GDP ($A4½ million) during 2013–15,
which would require additional adjustments without donor assistance. Thus staff urged the
authorities to save windfall revenue and grants to be prepared for these risks.

7

The International Agreement on the TTF has provided a system of governance that includes a Board, an
investment committee, and an advisory committee in which donor representatives are participating. Moreover,
the fund is managed by professional fund managers currently based in Australia, and monitoring of fund
performance is carried out by another consulting firm.

9
16.
Public financial management. Staff advised that fiscal management be strengthened
urgently. In the absence of its own currency and monetary policy, sound fiscal policy is key
to maintaining macroeconomic stability. However, fiscal management has not been prudent
in recent years, as windfall revenue from the TTF and fishing licenses has tended to be
immediately spent on major public construction projects and subsidies and transfers. The
mission recommended saving windfall revenue, given the volatility of key revenue items, and
using a medium-term budget framework to highlight the longer-term impact of the current
fiscal stance and new spending initiatives. Moreover, the authorities need to improve budget
reporting and monitoring and strengthen economic and policy analysis capacity. Staff also
advised that the US$10 million debt (about 30 percent of GDP) relating to joint ventures with
foreign fishing companies be clarified soon and that the process of providing government
guarantees be strengthened.
17.
Relations with public enterprises. Staff noted that the government needs to
regularize its financial relations with public enterprises. The government has substantial
amounts of arrears to public enterprises, including utility bills amounting to almost 1 percent
of GDP, and public enterprises have not paid their taxes on time. The mission urged the
government and public enterprises to resolve these problems soon and honor their financial
obligations to each other.
18.
Authorities’ views. The authorities agreed on the need for fiscal consolidation and
stated that the new government will soon establish a Revenue and Expenditure Review
Committee to be chaired by the Minister of Finance to consider possible avenues to widen
the revenue base and to cut high levels of spending, including on the medical treatment
scheme. They indicated that they would consider the mission’s proposed fiscal adjustment
scenario and that the 2011 budget would be only the first step in the required adjustments.
However, they emphasized the importance of donor assistance to help them steer through the
difficult path ahead and asked for technical assistance on tax audit. On climate change, the
authorities felt that donors have made many pledges of financial and technical support, but
have not delivered them. On the US$10 million debt related to joint ventures with foreign
fishing companies, the authorities believe that no government guarantee was extended to this
debt, but they will check all the related documents and inform staff accordingly.
B. Financial Sector
19.
Lending standards. Banks have taken measures to address high nonperforming loans.
The NBT remains profitable, mainly due to high foreign exchange income, but the
Development Bank continues to incur losses. Starting in early 2010, the two banks and the
Provident Fund started sharing borrowers’ information and tightening their lending standards,
including lowering the maximum debt service to income ratio from 50 to 40 percent for all
personal loans, which the mission supported. Staff also encouraged the banks to make further
efforts to recover nonperforming loans. Banks’ interest rates should be market determined so

10
the mission urged the government to withdraw the direction to lower NBT lending rates by
1 percentage point.
20.
Bank supervision. The mission welcomed passage of a Banking Act in August 2010.
Amendments to the Act have been submitted to Parliament in December to be fully in line
with the Basel Core Principles, including enhancement of the Bank Commissioner’s
independence.8 However, no progress has been made yet in putting in place supervisory and
prudential requirements such as minimum capital and loan loss provisioning. Continued
progress in strengthening the banking sector and credit culture is critical for sustained growth
in the private sector.
21.
Authorities’ views. The authorities noted that, given their lack of experience in bank
supervision and regulation, it would take time to implement the new Act and they need
technical assistance. Moreover, they need to develop a proper framework for appointing the
Bank Commissioner, whose job would be only part time given the size of the banking sector
in Tuvalu. They would check whether the previous government indeed directed the NBT to
lower lending rates as claimed and rescind the direction if it was in fact given.
C. Structural Reform
22.
Public enterprise reform. The mission supported the comprehensive public
enterprise reform program underway with ADB assistance to improve the performance and
profitability of public enterprises. A Public Enterprise (Performance and Accountability) Act
was passed in 2010, and a Public Enterprise Reform Monitoring Unit (PERMU) responsible
for public enterprise compliance with the Act was established. Moreover, the government is
now required to compensate public enterprises for non-profitable services—community
service obligations (CSOs)—which they are directed by the government to provide. Several
public enterprises as well as business activities undertaken by line ministries are being
considered for mergers, private sector participation, and possible corporatization. The
ongoing reforms could reduce burdens on the budget down the road and help attract foreign
direct investment.
23.
Job creation. Staff noted that education and vocational training need to be
strengthened to enable Tuvaluans to take advantage of overseas job opportunities. Given
Tuvalu’s limited land area, poor soil, and geographic isolation, it is difficult to create large
private-sector employment opportunities domestically. Thus the mission encouraged the
authorities to help Tuvaluans to better utilize the temporary labor migration scheme available
in New Zealand and to explore opportunities to participate in a similar Australian scheme.
Moreover, demand for Tuvaluan seafarers on the international maritime employment market
8

11
is declining, due to more competition from other countries.9 According to studies by the
World Bank and other donors, adequate training needs to be provided for seafarers and
temporary seasonal workers to maintain these job opportunities for Tuvaluans.
24.
Poverty has risen in the last few years. Although extreme poverty is rare in Tuvalu
because of traditional social support

number of seafarers employed. This
development indicates the importance of improving the quality of education and vocational
training to reduce poverty in Tuvalu.
25.
Authorities’ views. The authorities stated that the new government is committed to
enforcing and implementing the ongoing public enterprise reform. They noted that to address
poverty issues and enhance the competitiveness of Tuvaluans for job opportunities
internationally, the government is focusing more on strengthening vocational training. The
project to upgrade the Tuvalu Maritime Training Institute (TMTI) had been badly managed.
Repairs to the TMTI facilities are underway, but the authorities stated that they need donors’
financial and technical support.
D. Other
26.
External stability. Staff noted that the use of the Australian dollar as its currency is
appropriate given the size of the economy and limited capacity for independent monetary and
exchange rate policies. The real effective exchange rate has appreciated by 8 percent over the
last year. However, exports are minimal at about 1–2 percent of GDP and the country
depends highly on imports given almost no domestic production base except subsistence
farming and fishing. The country’s geographic remoteness and limited air services also
constrain tourism with just over 300 visitors each year.10 The current account deficit

in recent years.

12
(excluding grants) is very high but is projected to decline with fiscal adjustment, which is key
to maintaining external stability.
27.
Article XIV/VIII. At the time of joining the Fund, Tuvalu availed itself of the
transitory provisions of Article XIV, Section 2. While the exchange control regulations are
quite restrictive and prescribe approval requirements from the NBT or the Finance Minister
for most payments or transfers, in practice, no approval is required and payments and
transfers for current international transactions are administered liberally.11 Staff
recommended that the regulations be updated in line with current practice so that Tuvalu can
accept the obligations of Article VIII, Sections 2, 3 and 4.
28.
Statistics. Staff stressed that data shortcomings, particularly in the national accounts
and balance of payments, hamper surveillance. The mission urged the authorities to provide
more staff to the Statistics Division to start compiling the data necessary for surveillance and
their own policy analysis and formulation. Moreover, attention needs to be paid to improving
source data for macroeconomic statistics. Many of the underlying data have inconsistencies
and errors, resulting in poor quality of the national accounts and balance of payments
statistics.
29.
Authorities’ views. The authorities indicated that they will request TA from PFTAC
to update or repeal the exchange control regulations and improve statistics. They are looking
for additional staff for the Statistics Division but it is not easy to find good candidates.
Continued training of their staff by PFTAC would also be critical.
V. STAFF APPRAISAL
30.
Despite its geographic remoteness, Tuvalu has not been immune to the global
financial crisis. Even with higher government spending, the economy is expected to have
almost no growth in 2010 owing to lower offshore earnings. Growth is projected to be zero
or even turn negative in 2011, led by lower government spending, and remain low over the
medium term. Given projected global food and fuel prices, inflation is expected to remain
low. The outlook is subject to risks related to a delay in fiscal adjustment and the pace of the
global recovery.
31.
The government needs to take immediate action to cut spending. In response to
the global crisis, the government continued to increase spending to support the economy,
resulting in a large increase in the fiscal deficit and a rapid decline in the fund (CIF) available
for budget financing in 2010. At the current pace of spending, the CIF will be depleted in
mid-2011. A front-loaded adjustment would be needed and the 2011 budget deficit should be
11

Staff is currently conducting a comprehensive review of the exchange system to assess jurisdictional

13
contained to about 11 percent of GDP, mainly through a cut in capital spending, which
jumped sharply in recent years. The government also should bring down other spending by
freezing wages, reducing travel costs, and cutting social transfers and subsidies, particularly
the unsustainable medical treatment scheme.
32.
Further adjustments would be required over the medium term to ensure fiscal
sustainability. Tax administration needs to be strengthened to increase domestic revenue to
earlier levels, and government spending needs to be contained further. A weaker global
recovery would require additional fiscal adjustments without donor assistance. The
government should come up with a longer-term plan to rebuild the CIF to its targeted balance.
Implementing sound fiscal policy would also be necessary to build fiscal space to respond to
natural disasters and the impact of climate change.
33.
Fiscal management should be strengthened urgently. In the absence of its own
currency and monetary policy, sound fiscal policy is key to maintaining macroeconomic
stability. However, fiscal management has not been prudent in recent years, as windfall
revenue has tended to be immediately spent. Windfall revenue needs to be saved, given the
volatility of key revenue items, and a medium-term budget framework should be used to
highlight the longer-term impact of the current fiscal stance and new spending initiatives.
Moreover, budget reporting and monitoring need to be improved and economic and policy
analysis capacity should be strengthened. The process of providing government guarantees
also should be strengthened.
34.
Public enterprise reform should press ahead. Very low tariff structures,
government arrears, and structural inefficiencies are the major impediments to sound balance
sheets. Passage of a Public Enterprise Act and related reforms underway with ADB
assistance are welcome. Several public enterprises are being considered for mergers, private
sector participation, and possible corporatization. The government and public enterprises also
need to regularize their relations by honoring their financial obligations to each other.
35.
Continued progress in strengthening the banking sector and credit culture is
critical for sustained growth in the private sector. Banks have started addressing high
nonperforming loans by sharing borrowers’ information and tightening lending standards.
But further efforts would be needed to recover bad loans. Passage of a Banking Act is
welcome, but no progress has been made yet in putting in place supervisory and prudential
requirements.
36.
The use of the Australian dollar as its currency is appropriate given the size of
the economy and limited capacity for independent monetary and exchange rate policies.
Exports are minimal and the country depends highly on imports given almost no domestic
production base except subsistence farming and fishing. Fiscal adjustment will be key to
maintaining external stability.

14
37.
Education and vocational training need to be strengthened. Given Tuvalu’s
limited land area, poor soil, and geographic isolation, it is difficult to create large privatesector employment opportunities domestically. Thus, Tuvaluans need to better utilize
overseas job opportunities, including seafarer employment and the temporary labor migration
scheme in New Zealand. Education and vocational training need to be strengthened to
enhance the competitiveness of Tuvaluans for these important sources of foreign exchange
earnings and to reduce poverty, which has risen in the last few years.
38.
Data shortcomings, particularly in the national accounts and balance of
payments, hamper surveillance. More staff needs to be provided to start compiling the data
necessary for surveillance and the authorities’ own policy analysis and formulation.
39.
Staff recommends that the next Article IV consultation take place on a 24-month
cycle.

Tuvalu’s legal tender is the Australian dollar. There is no central monetary institution.
Tuvalu avails itself of transitional arrangements under Section 2 of Article XIV and
has not yet accepted the obligations under Article VIII, Sections 2, 3, and 4. The legal
framework for the exchange and trade system is the Exchange Control Law of 1981
and the Exchange Control Regulations of 1983, as amended. Staff is currently
conducting a comprehensive review of the exchange system to assess jurisdictional
implications. While the Exchange Control Regulations are quite restrictive and
prescribe approval requirements from the National Bank of Tuvalu (NBT) or the
Minister of Finance for most payments or transfers, in practice, no approval is
required and transactions are administered liberally.
The NBT is the only bank in Tuvalu handling foreign exchange transactions. The
NBT buys and sells foreign exchange at rates determined daily by the NBT’s board
on the basis of rates quoted in the international markets plus specific spreads
dependent on the specific foreign currency.
VIII. Article IV Consultation:
The first Article IV consultation discussions took place during November 11–
23, 2010.

ANNEX II. TUVALU: WORLD BANK-IMF COLLABORATION
The Bank and Fund country teams, led by Mr. Byung K. Jang (Fund mission chief for
Tuvalu) and Mr. Piers Merrick (country officer, EACNQ), have maintained a close
working relationship since Tuvalu’s decision to pursue membership of the Bretton Woods
institutions in 2009. The Bank team joined the membership mission as well as the first
Article IV consultation mission. Teams from the Asian Development Bank (ADB), AusAID,
and NZAID also overlapped with the Article IV mission.
The teams agree that Tuvalu’s main macroeconomic challenge is to cut government
spending to avoid looming fiscal problems and ensure fiscal sustainability over the
longer term. Based on this shared assessment, the teams identified the following structural
reform areas as macro-critical in view of their central role in achieving fiscal consolidation
and sustained growth:
i.

Strengthening public financial management. In the absence of its own currency
and monetary policy, sound fiscal policy is key to maintaining macroeconomic
stability. However, fiscal management has not been prudent in recent years, as
windfall revenue from the Tuvalu Trust Fund and fishing licenses has tended to be
immediately spent on major public construction projects, subsidies, and transfers.
Windfall revenue needs to be saved, given the volatility of key revenue items, and a
medium-term budget framework should be used to highlight the longer-term impact
of current fiscal stance and new spending initiatives. Moreover, budget reporting and
monitoring need to be improved and economic and policy analysis capacity should be
strengthened.

ii.

Reforming public enterprises. The ADB is undertaking a comprehensive public
enterprise reform program to improve the current weak performance and profitability
of public enterprises. Several public enterprises as well as business activities
undertaken by line ministries are being considered for mergers, private sector
participation, and possible corporatization. The ongoing reforms could reduce
burdens on the budget down the road and help attract foreign direct investment.

iii.

Exploring opportunities for poverty reduction, job creation, and private sector
development. Tuvalu’s geographic isolation, small size, and poor land quality have
made it extremely challenging to generate domestic private sector employment.
Demand for Tuvaluan seafarers on the international maritime employment market is
declining, due to more competition from other countries, and existing labor migration
schemes have not been well utilized. Adequate education and training need to be
provided for Tuvaluans to better utilize these overseas job opportunities and to reduce
the rising poverty.

The teams expect to sustain the close cooperation going forward. Attachment 1 details the
specific activities implemented and planned by the two teams over the period July 2010—
October 2011. It was agreed that details of further collaboration would be determined at the
technical level as the scope of engagement is further defined.

ANNEX III. TUVALU: RELATIONS WITH THE ASIAN DEVELOPMENT BANK1
The Asian Development Bank (ADB) assistance to Tuvalu aims to contribute to improving
the quality of Tuvalu’s human resource capital by ensuring the provision of basic education
and primary health through the implementation of its national plan, Te Kakeega II. Given the
lack of resources, successive governments have focused on the education and health of its
people as the foundation for future opportunities. The Country Partnership Strategy
(CPS) 2008–2012 therefore focuses on ensuring a credible budget that will allow increased
allocations of scarce financial resources to government priority areas: primary education and
preventative health care. This will be achieved through targeting improved public
expenditure and financial management.
A set of five Performance Benchmark Indicators has been developed to track achievement of
the stated social sector outcomes, through a focus on fiscal prudence. These benchmarks also
consolidate assistance programs for ADB, AusAID, and NZAID to support the prioritized
and sustainable implementation of Te Kakeega II.
To improve aid effectiveness, the government, ADB, AusAID, and NZAID signed the
Development Partners Declaration (DPD) in 2009. The declaration will not only facilitate
closer harmonization for improved aid effectiveness, but also ensure that implementation of
specific projects do not undermine the general priority direction as agreed in the government
performance benchmark indicators. The DPD remains open to other development partners.
ADB has approved 2 loans and 1 grant totaling $11.06 million from the Asian Development
Fund (ADF) and 21 technical assistance (TA) totaling $5.91 million to Tuvalu since it joined
ADB in 1993. In recent years, ADB operational strategy has focused on improving
governance and economic management, as well as providing skills development to enhance
employment opportunities. Improvement of services on the outer islands, where poor and
vulnerable groups are concentrated, has also been undertaken, partly through the sustainable
financing mechanisms through the establishment of the Falekaupule Trust Fund.
Active projects include a grant and a TA project. The grant which was approved in 2008
focuses on: (i) development of a strengthened governance framework for the oversight of
public enterprises in Tuvalu, (ii) improved capacity for oversight on the part of the
government, (iii) the capacity to respond positively to such oversight on the part of public
corporations, (iv) strengthened capacity to manage debt, and (v) a reduction in government
debt to the National Bank of Tuvalu (NBT). The TA directly supports the achievement of the
program grant through improving government capacity and commitment to fiscal
management; and addressing issues which are contributing to public enterprise non1

areas including audit and technical and vocational education.

ANNEX IV. TUVALU: RELATIONS WITH THE PACIFIC FINANCIAL TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE
CENTRE (PFTAC)1
The Centre’s assistance to Tuvalu since 2006 has included 8 advisory missions. Tuvalu also sent
eleven officials to regional seminars and workshops.
Tax administration and policy
In 2007 and 2008, PFTAC supported the ADB which took responsibility for implementing
the tax policy reforms recommended by PFTAC.
A PFTAC mission visited Tuvalu in August 2010 to conduct a post implementation review of
the Tuvalu Consumption Tax and changes to the personal and business income tax changes
implemented in 2009. Compliance with all tax obligations in Tuvalu is poor, enforcement is
limited, and skills within the tax office are low. Government departments are also
noncompliant. A debt and return collection guide was developed and a cabinet note prepared
for the new cabinet seeking endorsement of stricter enforcement actions.
PFTAC will liaise with the ADB to provide longer-term assistance to Tuvalu to improve
compliance levels and skills within the tax office. Much of the compliance improvement is
dependent on political support.
The proposed regional IT support strategy for countries with the Revenue Management
Software (RMS) will also benefit Tuvalu if it signs the service contract for ongoing
maintenance of its new computer system.
A Tuvalu representative has attended Pacific Islands Tax Administrators Association
(PITAA) in Cook Islands, Papua New Guinea, and Vanuatu and the head of the tax office
undertook an attachment to Fiji Islands Revenue & Customs Authority (FIRCA) sponsored
by PFTAC.
Financial sector regulation and supervision
At the request of the ADB, a mission was conducted from July 2–7, 2008 concurrently with
the ADB.
1

Prepared by PFTAC staff. PFTAC, which is based in Suva, Fiji, is a multi-donor technical assistance
institution, financed by the IMF, ADB, AusAID, NZAID, Japan, and Korea, with the IMF as executing agency.
The Centre's aim is to build skills and institutional capacity for effective economic and financial management
that can be sustained at the national level. Member countries are: Cook Islands, Federated States of Micronesia,
Fiji, Kiribati, Marshall Islands, Nauru, Niue, Palau, Papua New Guinea, Samoa, Solomon Islands, Tokelau,
Tonga, Tuvalu, and Vanuatu.

9
These were to: (i) assess the operating condition and performance of the National Bank of
Tuvalu along with the adequacy of its lending and liquidity policies and (ii) follow-up on the
status of legislation to implement a legal framework for the licensing and on-going
supervision and regulation of banks.
During 2009–10, in response to a request from the ADB, assistance has been provided to
Tuvalu in reviewing and providing comments/feedback on proposed legislation to supervise
and regulate banking institutions to assure compliance with Basel core principles and best
practices. In response to this assistance, the Tuvalu authorities have forwarded to PFTAC
revised legislation incorporating many of the recommendations previously proposed by
PFTAC. A final review of the revised legislation, however, is pending.
Economic and financial statistics
A 2006 mission assessed data needs and prepared a work plan for increasing the range of
existing data to be incorporated into the national accounts and balance of payments estimates.
Subsequently, some work was begun on updating the estimates by a Central Statistics
Division staff member while on study leave in Fiji.
During 2009 two missions assisted the authorities to improve methodology and update the
balance of payments and national accounts statistics to the 2008 year. Improvements
included benchmarking the nominal national accounts estimates using recent Household
Income and Expenditure Survey data, rebasing the constant price estimates, estimation of
gross national disposable income, and moving the balance of payments to the latest
international standard. A staff member participated in a regional national accounts seminar in
Fiji in 2009. Two missions in 2010 assisted the authorities to make further data and
methodology improvements and to update the balance of payments and national accounts
statistics to 2009.

As of December 29, 2010
I. Assessment of Data Adequacy for Surveillance
General: Data have shortcomings that hamper surveillance. Shortcomings are most serious in the
national accounts and balance of payments. The Pacific Financial Technical Assistance Centre
(PFTAC) has provided technical assistance to the Central Statistics Division (CSD) of the Ministry of
Finance to help start compiling those statistics for surveillance and the authorities’ own policy analysis
and formulation. More staff needs to be provided to the CSD urgently.
National accounts: With PFTAC assistance in 2009 and 2010, the compilation methodology for the
national accounts was improved. However, little progress had been made on previous missions’
recommendations, largely due to a lack of capacity. Attention needs to be paid to improving source
data for national accounts.
Price statistics: The consumer price index (CPI) is the only price index compiled in Tuvalu. The CSD
produces a quarterly CPI, which is timely and of reasonable quality. The CPI weights are expected to
be revised in 2011, based on the 2010 Household Income and Expenditure Survey.
Government finance statistics: The MOF compiles the central government data for budget analysis
and control. However, the classifications of some accounts, particularly on capital spending, need to be
improved to be in line with international standards.
Monetary and financial statistics: Tuvalu uses the Australian dollar as its legal tender and does not
have a central bank. Monetary and financial statistics are currently not produced in Tuvalu. The
National Bank of Tuvalu and the Development Bank of Tuvalu provided the Article IV mission with
their balance sheets and income statements, which were used to produce the monetary data on the two
banks.
Balance of payments: Balance of payments statistics have been compiled by visiting PFTAC experts.
A balance of payments statistics mission took place in Tuvalu during June 29–July 8, 2010. The
mission assisted the authorities in developing a balance of payments compilation system to enable
CSD staff to compile the balance of payments data. The mission noted that many of the underlying
data have inconsistencies and errors, resulting in poor quality of the balance of payments statistics. In
addition, the mission noted that the CSD needs better trained staff to produce quality balance of
payments statistics.
II. Data Standards and Quality
Not a General Data Dissemination System participant.
III. Reporting to STA
No data are currently reported to STA for publication.

No data ROSC are available.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
February 2, 2011

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2010 Article IV Consultation with Tuvalu
On January 28, 2011, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded
the 2011 Article IV consultation with Tuvalu.1
Background
Despite its geographic remoteness, Tuvalu has not been immune to the global financial crisis.
Even with higher government spending, the economy is expected to have almost no growth in
2010 after contracting by about 2 percent in 2009. Major construction projects to build a wharf
and a power station have been completed, and seafarer employment—Tuvalu’s main foreign
exchange earning source for the private sector—is weak. Annual inflation has been negative
since mid-2009 (-1¾ percent in November 2010) due to lower global food prices and the strong
Australian dollar.
In response to the global crisis, the government continued to support the economy by
increasing spending. The large spending increases in the last few years have resulted in a
sharp increase in the fiscal deficit from 4 percent of GDP in 2009 to almost 30 percent of GDP
in 2010, as domestic revenue, offshore income, and grants fell. The large deficit has led to a
1

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On
return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the
Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the
Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the
country's authorities. An explanation of any qualifiers used in summings up can be found here:
http://www.imf.org/external/np/sec/misc/qualifiers.htm.

2
rapid decline in the fund available for budget financing to about 20 percent of GDP from
45 percent in 2009. Total spending relative to GDP has increased by 20 percentage points
since 2005, mainly due to sharp increases in subsidies, transfers and capital spending.
The current account deficit is estimated to increase sharply to almost 25 percent of GDP in
2010 due to low income and grants. Tuvalu exports little and depends heavily on imports. Gross
official reserves have declined substantially in 2010, but still remain high at about 8 months of
imports of goods and services. External public debt is at over 30 percent of GDP, but mostly on
concessional terms, resulting in low debt servicing obligations. However, total public debt
remains high by regional standards at about 44 percent of GDP.
The financial sector is underdeveloped and lending constrained, following rapid credit growth in
the early 2000s. Nonperforming loans are high at around 40 percent of total loans. Banks have
started addressing high nonperforming loans by sharing borrowers’ information and tightening
lending standards, including lowering the maximum debt service to income ratio from 50 to
40 percent for all personal loans. Interest rates on lending have changed little in recent years,
reflecting limited competition in the financial system.
The growth outlook remains clouded. Growth is projected to be zero or even turn negative in
2011, led by lower government spending, and remain low over the medium term. The outlook is
subject to risks related to a delay in fiscal adjustment and the pace of the global recovery.
Moreover, Tuvalu is vulnerable to natural disasters and climate change will be a major
challenge in light of rising sea levels.
Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors welcomed the opportunity to discuss this first Article IV consultation with
Tuvalu. Directors recognized that Tuvalu faces tremendous challenges because of its remote
location, limited land area, lack of resources, serious capacity constraints and the potential
impact of climate change. The uncertain global recovery is adding to the country’s
vulnerabilities. In light of the difficult near and medium-term prospects of the economy, Directors
emphasized the need for resolute fiscal adjustment and structural reforms. Noting the limited
domestic job opportunities, they agreed that the authorities should promote overseas
employment opportunities, which would generate income and help reduce poverty.
Directors urged the authorities to cut spending, given that the Consolidated Investment Fund
(CIF) available for budget financing will be depleted soon at the current pace of spending. They
called for a front-loaded adjustment mainly through cuts in capital spending, and subsidies and
transfers, which increased rapidly in recent years. Freezing wages and reducing travel costs will
also be important.
Directors agreed that to ensure fiscal sustainability, it will also be necessary to increase
domestic revenue, particularly by boosting efforts to increase tax compliance. At the same time,

3
saving any windfall revenue from offshore earnings into the CIF and formulating a medium-term
budget framework will strengthen fiscal management.
Directors agreed that use of the Australian dollar as Tuvalu’s currency is appropriate. They
underscored however that fiscal adjustment will be key to maintaining external stability.
Directors commended the authorities for their structural reform efforts. They welcomed the
ongoing public enterprise reform and looked forward to further progress in regularization of
government’s financial relations with the public enterprises. Directors stressed that continued
improvements in the banking sector and credit culture will help support private-sector
development. Noting the steps being taken to address the high level of nonperforming loans,
they urged the authorities to accelerate progress on putting in place the supervisory and
prudential requirements. Improving the country’s statistical capacity will be critical for policy
analysis and formulation.

Public Information Notices (PINs) form part of the IMF's efforts to promote transparency of the IMF's
views and analysis of economic developments and policies. With the consent of the country
(or countries) concerned, PINs are issued after Executive Board discussions of Article IV consultations
with member countries, of its surveillance of developments at the regional level, of post-program
monitoring, and of ex post assessments of member countries with longer-term program engagements.
PINs are also issued after Executive Board discussions of general policy matters, unless otherwise
decided by the Executive Board in a particular case.

Statement by Mr. Christopher Legg, Executive Director for Tuvalu
January 28, 2011
Background
Our Tuvaluan authorities greatly appreciated Staff’s comprehensive and objective
analysis of Tuvalu’s macroeconomic issues. The joint presence of the World Bank, the
ADB, and other development partners was also greatly appreciated, allowing for a joint
constructive exchange of views with their development partners on how to assist Tuvalu
in moving forward with its development issues. Our Tuvaluan authorities underscore the
benefits of becoming a member of the Fund and World Bank, with the most obvious
being access to technical assistance and policy advice to help address the country’s
development challenges, and not least, the potential to trigger financial assistance.
Though Tuvalu is one of the smallest and most remote countries in the world, its
economic performance is still highly susceptible to developments in the global economic
and financial arena. Its offshore earnings are subject to overseas asset price fluctuations
and exchange rate movements. The return on the Tuvalu Trust Fund (TTF) has been
below its targeted value in recent years, resulting in no distribution to the Consolidated
Investment Fund (CIF). The strengthening of the Australian dollar has also affected
Tuvalu’s offshore earnings from its dot.tv domain and fishing licenses, which are largely
denominated in the USD. The increased competitiveness in the global labor market has
seen the decline in the overseas employment of Tuvalu nationals, affecting remittances.
The public sector dominates Tuvalu’s economy, which in turn is largely dependent on
offshore earnings to deliver its services. In addition, Tuvalu’s lack of economies of scale,
because of its remoteness, and high costs of doing business, all constrain development,
whilst the climate change looms as a major fiscal, social, and indeed existential
challenge.
The significant near-term challenge for Tuvalu is to ensure immediate fiscal discipline in
the face of declining revenues. Over the medium term, Tuvalu will need to strengthen its
fiscal management to create fiscal space for countercyclical measures and to mitigate
against the volatility of offshore earnings.
Fiscal Policy
The volatility of offshore earnings and the relative dominance of the public sector in the
economy add significantly to the challenge of fiscal management, particularly in light of
the growing demands for better social services and public infrastructure.
Notwithstanding this, the authorities agree with Staff recommendation that fiscal
management needs to be strengthened immediately, and remedial actions need to be
taken to address the weakening fiscal position. Whilst there has been a recent change in
government, our Tuvaluan authorities wish to reassure the Board that the new

government ,recently appointed on December 24, has taken on board Staff
recommendations and are committed to fiscal discipline. Being in office for just over a
month, the government is still finalizing its plans for fiscal consolidation.
As an initial step towards fiscal consolidation, a Revenue and Expenditure Review
Committee is being established, that will consider avenues to widen the revenue base and
to cut high levels of spending, including the Tuvalu Medical Treatment Scheme (TMTS).
The authorities’ ultimate aim for the TMTS is a gradual reduction of costs. They aim to
do this through a review of the selection criteria for overseas medical referrals with a
view to tighten further such criteria. In addition, they plan to consult with external
providers of medical services, who are able to make regular visits and perform the
required medical treatment in Tuvalu. This will have potential economies of scale
benefits, bringing the medical treatment to Tuvalu that can benefit many, rather than only
a few, from the overseas medical referral scheme. Over the long term, the authorities aim
to seek assistance in improving and upgrading their domestic medical services. The
authorities are also reviewing capital spending with a view to prioritize and scale back
capital spending, given that most of the major infrastructure needs have been addressed in
recent years. The authorities have also taken measures to freeze further hiring, with a
view to better assess the size of the civil service.
The volatility in earnings also underscores the need to build up savings as a buffer against
future macroeconomic risks. In this context, the CIF (distributable income from the TTF)
has given Tuvalu a certain degree of financial security, underpinning the budget in recent
years. However, the authorities concur with Staff that more will need to be done to
rebuild the CIF to its targeted balance. To this effect, the Tuvaluan authorities
acknowledge that fiscal consolidation is key to rebuilding fiscal space, and, whenever
possible, saving windfall earnings. Understanding the need for fiscal adjustment over the
medium term, our Tuvaluan authorities are seeking assistance in the formulation of a
simple and credible medium-term budget framework. The authorities will also continue
to seek direct financial support from their developments partners, which they consider to
be a crucial buffer to the CIF, especially in times where the global and domestic
economic environment is weak.
As with their predecessors, the new government also emphasizes the importance of donor
assistance in supporting Tuvalu through the difficult and challenging times ahead. They
are currently seeking assistance in various areas, including strengthening tax
administration.
Financial Sector
The banking sector is underdeveloped with only two banks currently serving the country.
The two banks have taken measures to tighten lending standards to mitigate further
increases in non-performing loans. However, the authorities concur with Staff that further

progress in strengthening the banking sector and credit culture will be critical for
sustained growth in the private sector. The authorities have requested technical assistance
in this area.
The authorities are committed to accelerating the implementation and approval of the
Amendments to the Banking Act. They aim to have it endorsed and passed by Parliament
at its next sitting in early 2011.
In respect of bank interest rates, the newly appointed Minister of Finance has issued
instructions to the National Bank of Tuvalu (NBT) to suspend any directions given to
lower bank lending rates.
Structural Policy and Growth
The authorities agree with Staff’s assessment that most of the public enterprises face
challenging financial circumstances. The Tuvaluan authorities are looking into options,
such as mergers, private sector participation, as well as corporatization of public
enterprises and business activities. However, our authorities want to highlight the
constraints faced by the domestic private sector regarding capital and financing
requirements that hinder full participation in capital-intensive ventures. In addition,
limited availability of skilled managers hinders the effective and efficient operation of
public enterprises on a more commercial basis. An additional challenge is the lack of
required skills and capacity to monitor and operate corporatization models that depend on
arms length governance.
A comprehensive public enterprise reform program is currently underway with the
assistance of the ADB. One of its objectives’ aims is to regularize government’s financial
relations with its public enterprises. The authorities plan to discuss further with the ADB
whether the assistance can be extended to include a review of the US10 million debt
related to joint ventures with foreign fishing companies.
The authorities view their human resources as a potential source of economic growth.
However, they are also well aware that it is currently underdeveloped and not marketed
adequately. In addition, the high-travel costs from Tuvalu to external labor markets
reduce the attractiveness of hiring Tuvaluans. Nevertheless, the authorities plan to invest
in technical and vocational education and training aimed at establishing a niche in the
overseas labor market through the provision of high-quality services and the provision of
more practical skills aimed at gaps in domestic services. They are working closely with
recognized training institutions and development partners in this area. To address the fall
off in revenue from seafaring, the authorities are also looking into the scope to upgrade
maritime qualifications with the WB, indicating their interest in cultivating the potential
of the Tuvalu Maritime Training Institution (TMTI).

Data and Staffing
The authorities acknowledge the need to strive to continuously meet the standards
required by the Fund in terms of data quality and availability. Overall, the authorities
understand the value of quality data to assist in their policy analysis and formulation.
However, they highlight chronic shortages in the availability of qualified staff, which
underscores the importance of allocating scarce human resources most effectively.
Currently their efforts are being concentrated on getting the 2010 Household Income and
Expenditure Survey (HIES) completed. In addition, the components of the BOP data are
sourced from different arms of the government, which also require training and the
upgrading of their capacity to maintain and submit quality data on a timely basis. The
authorities consider sustained efforts to improve the quality of statistics staff to be vital
and have requested PFTAC assistance in this regard. They also see merit in continuing
assistance to update data to the minimum standard required for policy analysis until such
time that the domestic statistics staff are able to fully take on this role.
Conclusion
This was Tuvalu’s first Article IV mission since becoming a member of the IMF, and our
Tuvaluan authorities greatly appreciated the constructive policy dialogue with the Fund
Staff during the mission and in the process of finalizing the report. They would like to put
on record their appreciation of the contributions from the mission chief and his team. The
authorities look forward to working very closely with the Fund as they work towards
more sustainable growth.
