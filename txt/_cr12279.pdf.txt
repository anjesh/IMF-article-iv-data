STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2012 ARTICLE IV CONSULTATION
September 7, 2012

KEY ISSUES
Outlook: Growth is projected at 5 percent in 2012; more generally, the economic
rebound experienced since 2009 is moderating. Key risks to the outlook include
political instability, a decline in exports from a deeper global downturn, fiscal slippages,
financial sector stress, and uncertainties around the indigenization policy. Zimbabwe
faces these risks with very thin buffers. A vigorous program of reforms would help
boost growth and poverty reduction over the medium term.
Strengthening fiscal management and improving the expenditure mix: A more
robust budget process, including better planning and control of spending and more
transparency on diamond revenues, is needed to avoid slippages necessitating large
policy corrections in mid course. The spending mix is unsustainable, with employment
costs taking up a very large share of government resources. Over the medium term,
containing wage bill growth would create fiscal space to improve public services, raise
infrastructure investment, and build buffers.
Containing financial sector vulnerabilities: The multi-currency system, which has
served Zimbabwe well, demands a strict approach to financial system regulation and
supervision. Efforts are underway to strengthen the financial regulatory framework, but
vulnerabilities persist. A proactive approach to banking supervision, boosting system
liquidity, and restructuring the Reserve Bank will be essential.
SMP: The authorities remain interested in a staff-monitored program and have met the
outstanding marker for initiating a stock-taking on the feasibility of a staff-monitored
program; and resumed payments to the Poverty Reduction and Growth Trust.
Resolving external payment arrears: Zimbabwe’s debt overhang remains a serious
impediment to medium-term fiscal and external sustainability. Addressing this issue
will require a comprehensive arrears clearance framework underpinned by a strong
macro policy framework, in what will likely be a protracted process. Government
nonconcessional borrowing could complicate future external arrears clearance.

be room for clearing domestic arrears. In the
first half of 2012, however, diamond revenues
severely underperformed, and are now
projected to reach US$240 million (2¼ percent

are projected to exceed originally budgeted

Including a projected tax revenue shortfall of

that a fiscal gap of 6¼ percent of GDP had
emerged for this fiscal year.

2012 ARTICLE IV REPORT

Box 1. Zimbabwe—Proposed Fiscal Measures in the 2012 Mid-Year Fiscal Policy Review
The mid-year fiscal policy review (MYFPR) outlines urgent measures and policy actions to
address the current fiscal challenges which arose from a diamond revenue shortfall of about
3¼ percent of GDP, a shortfall in tax revenue of about ½ percent of GDP and employment
costs overrun of 2½ percent of GDP.
Revenue measures: Increased excise duties on petrol and diesel, and custom duty on wheat
flour are expected to raise ¼ percent of GDP in additional revenue. The government plans to
finalize the drafting of the income tax act, enhance ZIMRA systems, strengthen ZIMRA’s role in
monitoring the mineral resources process and review the revenue retention policy (estimated
to raise non-tax revenue by ¼ percent of GDP).
Expenditure measures: The Ministry of Finance proposed to rationalize recurrent and capital
expenditure by 2¾ and 3 percent of GDP, respectively. They announced an employment
freeze and no additional salary increase for the remainder of 2012, and actions to tackle the
serious domestic arrears situation.1
The proposed measures are second best, but necessary to address the gap in the budget.
However, to avoid recurrence of such a situation and to achieve fiscal sustainability in the
medium term, the government will need to increase transparency in the diamond sector and
step up its reform efforts in the areas of human resource management and PFM.

Even with the announced measures,

the gap cannot be fully closed. Staff projects
lower tax and diamond revenue, than that of
the authorities, implying a remaining budget
gap of 1 percent of GDP. Hence, additional
measures may be needed if tax revenue
undershoots the government’s projections,
diamond dividends do not pick up in the last
quarter as government expects, or new
spending pressures arise. These risks would
jeopardize the planned clearance of domestic
arrears and possibly lead to further arrears
accumulation. Given the measures already
announced, staff projects a cash deficit of
1½ percent of GDP in 2012, including
clearance of domestic arrears equivalent to
½ percent of GDP, financed by external loans
and a drawdown of Zimbabwe’s SDR holdings
by SDR 71.3 million ($110 million). The budget
is expected to remain under pressure going
into 2013, as the electoral cycle gains intensity
and wage pressures increase. Without
improvements in transparency, diamond
revenues can at best be expected to remain
around 2 percent of GDP in 2013.
17.

The expenditure mix is becoming

unsustainable. Developments during 2011–12
leave behind a distorted fiscal structure. Under
the unchanged policies scenario, employment
costs will continue to claim a disproportionate
majority of government’s limited resources,
crowding out public investment and service
delivery.

Staff recommendations
18.

Contain the 2012 budget

expenditure within available resources. In
this context, staff’s active policies scenario
seeks to contain the cash deficit to under
1½ percent of GDP. It is essential that the
authorities refrain from further wage increases
in the remainder of 2012. As indicated in their
mid-year fiscal policy review, the government
should bring forward some nontax revenue
and dispose of some assets to close about half
of the remaining budget gap. Even then, if
diamond revenues remain flat, additional
measures would become necessary. One
possibility, starting from October, is to convert
civil servants’ allowances into part of their
(taxable) salaries, yielding additional revenue
of about ½ percent of GDP. In addition, the
authorities should seek donor funding for the
census, the constitutional referendum, and
general elections to help reduce the risk of
fiscal slippages. Until transparency and the
regulatory framework in the diamond sector
are strengthened, it would be prudent to make
sure the core budget can be financed without
diamond revenue, and without further
drawdown of SDR holdings.
19.

Increase transparency in the

diamond sector to reduce the risk of fiscal
pressures, by fast-tracking the draft
Diamond Act. Drafting and submitting the
Diamond Act should be fast tracked. The
government should follow through on its plans

30.

Work should continue on the

restructuring of the RBZ. The RBZ remains in
financial distress, which constrains its ability to
undertake liquidity provision and distracts it
from focusing on its core functions. Proposed
modifications to the RBZ debt relief bill will
focus on transferring the liabilities from RBZ’s
balance sheet to a fund managed by the
finance ministry. While this is a less balanced
approach than the comprehensive balance
sheet bifurcation recommended by Fund TA
missions, it remains consistent with the
objective of restructuring the RBZ balance
sheet. In any case, the disposal of noncore
assets should proceed, and consideration
should be given to applying any proceeds to
the funding of the systemic liquidity facility.

Authorities’ views
32.

The bank regulator considered the

banking sector to be largely safe, but
remained concerned over uneven
distribution of liquidity. The RBZ argued
that the weaker banks were relatively few and
non-systemic. Meanwhile, lack of investment
instruments has caused the larger banks to
hold significant balances in cash and real time
gross settlement (RTGS) accounts, some of
which could be better channeled toward
lending.
33.

The RBZ emphasized its continued

commitment to implementing risk-based
supervision, through the Basel II
framework. A gradual approach is being
taken to allow banks to build the capacity to
operate in a Basel II environment. All banks
are expected to be Basel II compliant by 2013.

Source of Risks

2012 ARTICLE IV REPORT

Table 8. Zimbabwe: Risk Assessment Matrix17
Relative Likelihood
Impact if Realized

1. Resurgence in domestic
political instability ahead of
the elections.

Medium to High
Preparations for elections, now expected in
2013, and the deteriorating relationship
between the coalition partners could
complicate decision-making within
government.

Medium
Possible political instabilities and stalemates in
government decision-making could result in policy
setbacks, lower business confidence and possibly
cause further contraction of economic activity.

2. Strong intensification of
the euro area crisis.

Medium
Zimbabwe’s economy is currently sustained
by strong demand for key exports. In
addition, the country is heavily dependent
on external credit flows (including short
term) alongside accumulation of arrears, to
finance its large current account deficit.

3. Potential destabilizing
effects of the
indigenization and
empowerment policy.

Medium
Uncertainty and inconsistent around the
application of the policy has affected
investment decisions, particularly for new
investments, across the productive sector
and for FDI.

Low to Medium
Zimbabwe’s key exports could be impacted by a
global economic downturn. In particular, if a sharper
slowing in Europe and deceleration in China would
significantly lower commodity prices, as well as
activity in South Africa – Zimbabwe’s major trading
partner – balance of payments pressures could
heighten. For instance, a 10 percent fall in metals and
diamond prices would worsen the 2013 current
account deficit by about 2½ percent of GDP. In
addition, minerals and diamond production may also
contract in response to price developments. If
production fell by 10 percent, the current account
deficit would increase by another 2 percent of GDP
and also growth would fall by 1½ percentage points.
In addition, such a shock could also reduce debt
inflows and balance of payments difficulties could
quickly ensue in light of the low levels of reserves.
Medium
Continued uncertainties over policy implementation
would limit flows of well-needed foreign direct
investment, including in the mining sector.
Indigenization in the banking sector could exacerbate
existing liquidity and credit risks, and reduce
potential sources of external credit flows.

4. Fiscal slippages.

Medium
There is a risk that diamond revenues could
fall short even of the revised projection.
There are pressures from trade unions to
increase civil servants’ wages. If these
materialize, especially in the run-up to
elections, the authorities are likely to draw
down on already low levels of deposits and
further accumulate domestic arrears.
Medium
Several banks remain weakly capitalized
with imprudently low liquidity buffers,
particularly small banks. Asset quality has
deteriorated, reflecting unsound lending
practices and poor risk management; and
several banks are overstretched.

5. Financial sector
instabilities, including
liquidity constraints.

Medium
If nominal wages were increased by 20 percent for
civil servants in 2013 employment costs would
increase by about 2 percent of GDP. This along with
further shortfall in diamond revenue would
undermine service delivery and critical social and
capital spending. It might lead to a draw down in
government deposits causing another liquidity
crunch and new accumulation of domestic arrears
Medium to High
In the absence of a LOLR facility, deterioration in
bank capitalization would lead to further loss of
confidence in the banking system, aggravation of
already tight liquidity conditions, and possible bank
runs.

The Risk Assessment Matrix (RAM) shows events that could materially alter the baseline path discussed in this report
(which is the scenario most likely to materialize in the view of the staff). The relative likelihood of risks listed is the staff’s
subjective assessment of the risks surrounding this baseline. The RAM reflects staff's views on the source of risks and overall
level of concerns as of the time of discussions with the authorities.

ZIMBABWE

APPENDIX I. FORECASTING CPI INFLATION IN ZIMBABWE
The CPI inflation rate in Zimbabwe is highly
associated with both the CPI and PPI inflation
rates in South Africa with a lag, mostly due to
the high share of imports from South Africa.
Regression results indicate that a 1-precentage
point increase in the CPI inflation rate
(PPI inflation rate) in South Africa leads to 0.6percentage point (0.5-percentage point)
increase in the CPI inflation rate in Zimbabwe
five months later. A forecast using the CPI for
South Africa indicates that the rising trend will
continue until November 2012, whereas a
forecast using PPI for South Africa indicates a
weaker trend.
1.
The CPI inflation rate in Zimbabwe
is highly associated with both CPI and
PPI inflation rates in South Africa with a
lag. Although CPI inflation in Zimbabwe is
more volatile than CPI inflation in South Africa,
they are positively correlated with a correlation
coefficient of 0.51 (Chart 1).1 Considering that
more than half of Zimbabwe’s imports are
from South Africa, the relationship between
PPI inflation in South Africa and CPI inflation in
Zimbabwe was also observed. These are also
positively correlated, with a correlation
coefficient of 0.51 between CPI inflation in
Zimbabwe and one-month lagged PPI inflation
in South Africa (Chart 2).2
1

The CPI inflation rate for South Africa is the
annualized quarterly-change in the 3-month moving
average of the non-seasonally adjusted Headline CPI
series. The CPI inflation rate for Zimbabwe is the
annualized quarterly-change in the 3-month moving
average of the non-seasonally adjusted CPI series.
2

The PPI inflation rate for South Africa is the
annualized quarterly-change in the 3-month moving
average of the seasonally adjusted PPI for domestic
output, as the non-seasonally adjusted PPI series is
highly volatile.

2.
Regression results indicate that
there are five-month lags in the
relationships between CPI inflation in
Zimbabwe and CPI and PPI inflation in
South Africa. We analyze how fluctuations of
the CPI inflation rate in Zimbabwe can be
explained by either the CPI inflation rate or the
PPI inflation rate in South Africa. Considering
that Zimbabwe adopted the multicurrency
regime in 2009, we also include the rand/US
dollar exchange rate (period average) as an
explanatory variable. Throughout the analysis,

ZIMBABWE

we use non-seasonally adjusted year-on-year
percentage changes of monthly series of CPI,
PPI, and the exchange rate.
3.
The CPI inflation rate in Zimbabwe
responds to the South African CPI inflation
rate with some lags (Table 1). Measured in
terms of root mean squared error (RMSE), the
fluctuations of the CPI inflation rate in
Zimbabwe are best explained by
five-month lags of the CPI inflation rate in
South Africa and the rand/US dollar exchange
rate. A 1-percentage point increase in the
South African CPI inflation rate this month
leads to a 0.6-percentage point increase in
Zimbabwe’s CPI inflation rate 5 months later.
On the contrary, a 1-percentage point increase
in the rand/US dollar exchange rate reduces
Zimbabwe’s CPI inflation rate five months later
only marginally (-0.02 percentage point).
4.
The CPI inflation rate in Zimbabwe
also reacts to the South African PPI

2012 ARTICLE IV REPORT

inflation rate with some lags (Table 2).
RMSEs indicate that the CPI inflation rate in
Zimbabwe can also be best explained by
changes in South Africa’s PPI inflation rate and
the rand/US dollar exchange rate with a five
month lag: A 1-percentage point increase in
South Africa’s PPI inflation rate this month
leads to a 0.5-percentage point increase in
Zimbabwe’s CPI inflation rate five months later.
5.
The two regressions provide
different predictions of Zimbabwe’s CPI
inflation over the next five months (Chart 3,
Table 3). While the rising trend is expected to
continue until November 2012, according to a
forecast using the CPI for South Africa, a
forecast based on the PPI for South Africa
presents a weaker trend. It is also worth noting
that forecasts based on the South African CPI
or PPI do not capture any Zimbabwe-specific
inflationary factors, such as increases in
electricity tariffs and fuel excises.

APPENDIX II. ZIMBABWE—MINERAL RESOURCES
1.
Zimbabwe has significant exports
of non-renewable minerals, including
platinum, gold, and diamonds. The mining
sector, accounting for 12 percent of GDP in
2011, significantly contributed to exports,
supported by favorable world metal prices
(Chart 1). Zimbabwe’s platinum production
has been the world’s third largest, following
South Africa and Russia, since 2009 when
the third domestic producer (Unki) started
its full operation.1 Gold production has been
rapidly recovering from a plunge during the
hyperinflation period, although the 2010
production was only yet one third of peak
levels reached in 1999.2
Chart 1: Mining Exports

(share of total export value in 2011)

mining started in the Chimanimani fields in
2010. The government holds large shares in
several diamond mining companies through
the Zimbabwe Mining Development
Corporation, a parastatal (Table 1). While
international experience shows that
treasuries receive 15 to 30 percent of total
revenue on average, Zimbabwe could
receive more given the high stakes held by
the public sector.

Zimbabwe has large potential for
alluvial diamond production. Production
in the Marange fields started in 2006, and
estimates of its potential range from 25 to
36 million carats per year, with total gross
revenue of US$ 1–2 billion, which could be
sustained for 14 years. 3 In addition, trial

3.
Policies need to be strengthened
for the country to fully benefit from its
mineral wealth. The current regulatory
framework needs to be strengthened,
especially in light of concerns about
smuggling of precious metals.4 The
government should fast-track the new
diamond act and advance the process under
the Zimbabwe Mining Revenue
Transparency Initiative – a home grown
version of the Extractive Industry
Transparency Initiative standards. The plan
to introduce onsite monitoring by the
revenue authority at mining locations from
September 2012 onward is a welcomed
development.

The Indigenisation and Economic

2008 is the first legal basis for the

Zimbabwe, although the government has been
conducting indigenization activities, including
land reform, since independence in 1980. The
objectives of the IEE Act include:

government on IEE policies and
administers the Fund. The objective of the
Fund is to provide financial assistance to
indigenous Zimbabweans for the purposes
of share acquisitions and business startups, rehabilitation, and expansion. A
transfer of $3 million to the Fund in 2012 is
envisaged in the revised budget in the
mid-year fiscal policy review.

Implementation of the IEE Act
began in March 2010 with the publication
of specific regulations, with different
treatments across sectors. At first, it was
announced that all businesses with net asset

to formulate plans to transfer 51 percent of
their assets to indigenous Zimbabweans within
five years from the date of the operation of the

Box 1: Recent Bank Failures
In June 2011, Renaissance Merchant Bank was placed under 6-month curatorship after the RBZ’s
audit revealed an inappropriate shareholding structure, chronic undercapitalization and liquidity
challenges, high level of nonperforming insider and related party exposures, persistent losses, and
corporate governance and internal control deficiencies. The curatorship was lifted in March 2012,
following a cash injection by the National Social Security Authority, which acquired 84 percent
share in the holding company and installed new management.
Interfin Bank Limited was placed under recuperative curatorship on June 11, 2012, after a RBZ
audit determined that it was operating in an unsound and unsafe manner involving: inadequate
capitalization; concentrated shareholding; abuse of corporate structures; high level of nonperforming insider and related party loan exposures; chronic liquidity; income generating
challenges; weak governance and management oversight, and violation of banking laws and
regulations.
Genesis Investment Bank voluntarily surrendered its banking license to the RBZ in June 2012,
after failing to realize adequate financing from partners that the bank had been courting since
2009. The RBZ has commenced the modalities on liquidating the bank.
On July 27, 2012, Royal Bank Zimbabwe Limited surrendered its banking license to the RBZ. Onsite
inspection by the RBZ determined that the bank was critically undercapitalized, faced chronic
liquidity challenges and liabilities to the RTGS system, had high non-performing insider loans, and
had been misrepresenting information to the RBZ.

APPENDIX VI. ZIMBABWE: DEBT CLEARANCE AND MACROECONOMIC MANAGEMENT
STRATEGIES
1.

The Zimbabwean authorities

recently formulated–the Zimbabwe Arrears
Clearance, Debt and Development Strategy
(ZAADDS) —a policy framework for arrears
clearance and debt management; and the
Zimbabwe’s Accelerated Re-engagement
Economic Program (ZAREP)—an economic
policy framework covering an 18–24 month
period. The ZAADDS and the ZAREP are key
elements of the authorities’ economic reform
agenda, which is expected to lay the
foundation for sustainable development. The
policies were adopted in March 2012.
2.

The ZAADDS is a hybrid debt

resolution strategy that includes the
adoption of the traditional debt resolution
initiatives, combined with leveraging
Zimbabwe’s natural resources in pursuit of
economic development. The main objectives
are to secure comprehensive external debt
relief and arrears clearance from creditors and
to lay foundation for economic growth
through sound macroeconomic management

and reengaging with the international
community.
3.

The ZAREP is designed to establish

a track record of sound policies to support
the government’s agenda of achieving debt
relief and arrears clearance. It seeks to build
on the macroeconomic stability achieved
under the authorities’ Short-term Emergency
Recovery Programs (STREP I and II) through
implementation of sound macroeconomic
policies, containing and managing the public
sector wage bill and securing support from
development partners for debt relief.
4.

In recognition of the need to

restore credibility and reengage the
international community, a Friends of
Zimbabwe roundtable was held in March 2012
in Tunis with a follow-up meeting in
Washington during the Spring Meetings. There
was a general concern about Zimbabwe’s
unsustainable debt and arrears situation and
the call was made for a coordinated approach
to resolve these problems.

ZIMBABWE 2012 ARTICLE IV REPORT—INFORMATIONAL ANNEX

III. STATISTICAL ISSUES
As of July 2012
I. Assessment of Data Adequacy for Surveillance
General: Data provision has shortcomings but the data is broadly adequate for surveillance. Despite
recent improvements in timeliness and coverage, there are some shortcomings stemming from weak
data sources, insufficient coverage and capacity constraints. On May 17, 2010, the Executive Board
approved a list of targeted TA, including macrostatistics. In April 2012, ZIMSTAT resumed publishing
the “Quarterly Digest of Statistics”– a booklet that shows most of economic/social data. A census was
carried out in [August] 2012. Labor market statistics, including unemployment rate are expected to be
available in 2013.
National Accounts: The most recent official publication of national accounts data includes
developments in 2010 based on surveys of industrial production, a quarterly employment survey and a
survey of non-profit institutions. The production of national accounts is constrained by insufficient
input data, low survey response rates, and resource capacity. Benchmark data for industrial production
have improved with the 2010 update but the last income, consumption, and expenditure survey of any
reasonable quality was made in 2001 (a survey made in 2007/08 collected data that are distorted due
to hyperinflation). At the same time, despite the revision of the base year to 2009 for GDP, value
added for most sectors including agriculture is still based on 1990 weights for individual commodities,
because of the difficulty in constructing weights based on relative prices in 2009, when prices were not
stable just after the end of hyperinflation and the adoption of the multicurrency system. Analysis of the
2011 household survey is underway.
Price statistics: In March 2009, ZIMSTAT published a new consumer price index (CPI) based on prices
in U.S. dollars, with December 2008 as the base. The index uses 2001 weights for the consumer basket.
However, when aggregating the CPI from individual prices and sub-groups CPIs, ZIMSTAT’s calculation
omits items/regions for which information on prices is not available. This effectively results in timevarying weights that are significantly different from the original 2001 weights. There are concerns that
the CPI does not adequately reflect the price changes faced by households. A review of the weights,
coverage, and outlet and product selections is expected to be completed by end-2012.
Government finance statistics: The Ministry of Finance (MoF) does not yet compile government
finance statistics in line with the Government Finance Statistics Manual (GFMS) 2001, but is in the
process of moving to GFSM 2001, with IMF TA. Budget data are complied only for the budgetary
central government. Reporting of government finance statistics for the central government has
improved significantly over the past three years. The MoF collects data on revenue and expenditure,
which are published on its website on a monthly basis, along with budget statements. There is limited
data on government financing. The MoF is in the final stages of reconciling and validating its external
debt data with creditors.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND 11

2012 ARTICLE IV REPORT—INFORMATIONAL ANNEX

ZIMBABWE

Monetary statistics: The RBZ produces monthly monetary and financial statistics which is published
on their website. The RBZ has has not published an annual report or audited financial statement since
2008. They are far advanced with the audit of the 2010 financial statements that carry a qualified audit
opinion and present a negative equity position of US$ 1,235.9 million. The basis of the qualification
relates to disputed liabilities totaling US $20.5 million that will require resolution prior to any transfer of
liabilities from the RBZ. MCM and STA technical assistance and the Article IV missions have made
recommendations on central bank accounting and reporting. Timeliness and coverage of data continue
to improve.
External sector statistics: Balance of payments and external debt statistics are subject to a number of
data issues. There is a structural break in trade data in 2010. The source of trade data is the Exchange
Control Department of the RBZ for years prior to 2010, and in 2010 onwards, it is based on customs
data. In 2010 and 2011, there are very large, unidentified financing flows in the BOP which are
financing imports, but cannot be explained. Labor income and workers’ remittances do not include
estimates of cash and in-kind transfers from Zimbabweans working abroad. Interest payments are not
yet reconciled with creditors’ records and do not contain accrued interest on overdue financial
obligations. Data on outstanding debt stocks and principal payments are inconsistent with data
received by staff directly from Paris Club and major multilateral creditors, but finalization of the
authorities’ debt reconciliation exercise is expected to remedy this. Current and capital transfers to
nongovernmental organizations and to the government are not fully reconciled with donors’ data. The
financial account is incomplete, as it does not record substantial transactions in assets that are reported
by central banks that are members of the Bank for International Settlements. The RBZ’s initial
submission of flows and stocks of gross international reserves and its net foreign assets position often
require substantial adjustments. Exceptional financing does not fully capture the flow of overdue
financial obligations. External sector data are reported to the staff irregularly with significant delays.
II. Data Standards and Quality
Participant in the General Data Dissemination System

No data ROSC is available.

since November 1, 2002.
III. Reporting to STA
Zimbabwe does not report balance of payments statistics or the international investments position to
STA for redissemination in the International Financial Statistics or the Balance of Payments Statistics
Yearbook. No monetary or fiscal data are currently reported to STA for publication in the International
Financial Statistics, and annual fiscal data are also not reported for inclusion in the Government Finance
Statistics Yearbook. National accounts data have not been reported since 2005 and no data are being
reported for the new CPI.

STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2012 ARTICLE IV
CONSULTATION—DEBT SUSTAINABILITY ANALYSIS1

September 7, 2012

Approved By

Prepared by

Association

Based on the external LIC DSA, Zimbabwe is in debt distress. The public DSA suggests
that Zimbabwe’s overall public debt remains unsustainable in light of current fiscal
policies and the current size and evolution of the debt stock. The authorities broadly
agreed with these conclusions. Under a country-specific alternative upside scenario, debt
burden indicators would decline faster but the country’s external debt ratios would still
remain above indicative thresholds.

This exercise was guided by the Staff Guidance Note on the Application of the Joint Fund Bank Debt

While domestic public debt remains

a comparatively small component of total
debt, it is, nevertheless, another source of
vulnerability. Total domestic government
debt is estimated at $507 million at end-2011.
The domestic debt incurred by the Reserve
Bank of Zimbabwe (RBZ) accounts for the
largest part of this ($342 million), but also
some other expenditure arrears of $160 million
have accumulated.2 Unidentified domestic
contingent liabilities within the parastatal
sector or related to RBZ restructuring are
another source of potential debt.

These figures are provisional estimates, and could
rise if additional liabilities of the central bank and its
subsidiaries are identified.

reforms, and potential political uncertainty
surrounding the pending elections. Growth is
projected to be lower than in the recent past,

revenues are projected to rise to around
33¼ percent in 2012 on the back of improved
tax collection. Customs revenues may decline
somewhat over the medium term as Zimbabwe
simplifies its tariff structure in line with its
commitments under regional trade
agreements. Other revenues are expected to
remain broadly unchanged relative to GDP.
Central government cash expenditures are
expected to peak at around 36½ percent of
GDP in 2012, before leveling off at around

(iv) working capital for NetOne – a telecommunication

renovation of Victoria Falls Airport ($161 million) and a

Box 1. Key Macroeconomic Assumptions: Baseline Scenario




Real GDP is projected to grow by about
4.7 percent in the medium term and 3 percent in
the long term. After rises in mining production
including diamond production in the near term,
growth is projected to decelerate in the medium
term. Slow progress in addressing structural
bottlenecks, including relatively high public
wage costs, poorly maintained infrastructure,
liquidity problems in the financial sector, and a
poor business climate, is expected to pose
constraints to higher growth in other sectors.
Inflation would remain contained at an average
of about 4½ percent in the medium to long
term.



FDI will remain limited in the medium and long
term against the backdrop of uncertainty
relating to the implementation of the
indigenization policy. The balance of payments
would remain financed largely by debt-related
inflows. The possibility of their drying up
constitutes an important downside risk.



Import growth would gradually decline in line
with slower economic growth, with limited
private capital inflows and lack of access to nonhumanitarian assistance also posing constraints.



Fiscal cash deficits of 1½, 2 and ¾ percent of
GDP are projected in 2012, 2013 and 2014,
respectively, given already-contracted external
borrowing from Chinese creditors for capital
spending projects. Thereafter, it is assumed that
small cash surpluses of ¼ to ½ percent of GDP
would be attained and no further external loans
would be contracted.

Donor support is assumed to remain confined to
humanitarian assistance. Zimbabwe is expected
to remain in debt distress– even after
accounting for higher mineral receipts and
increased FDI, except in the context of a
comprehensive arrears clearance and debt relief
strategy. No debt relief is expected under the
baseline scenario.

The sensitivity analysis illustrates that

Zimbabwe’s unsustainable debt situation
could worsen further (Table 4). Analysis shows
that, if key variables returned to recent historical
averages even temporarily, external debt
indicators could deteriorate rapidly compared to
the baseline scenario. In particular, the country’s
debt is highly susceptible to renewed growth
shocks. However, in the short term, a combination

2011 to 74.5 percent of GDP in 2017, but ratios
would remain elevated and above indicative
benchmarks.10 Debt service, including arrears,
would continue to rise and remain unaffordable
due to the large size of arrears. Continued reforms
to underpin high growth would be essential for
debt sustainability alongside a comprehensive
arrears clearance framework. Results of the most
extreme stress test show that the present value of
the public debt-to-GDP ratio could more than
double over the next ten years if Zimbabwe
suffers another large growth shock in the near
future (Table 3).11

Some loans from these Chinese creditors are the only
ones that are currently serviced, with all other public
debt service going into arrears. This assumption is
maintained for the projection period.

World Bank and IMF staff estimations suggest that
for countries with a low CPIA rating, public debt in

Box 2. Key Macroeconomic Assumptions: Alternative Scenario


Real GDP is projected to grow at an average of
7 percent over the medium term driven by
mainly by increased investment in mining and
strong growth in construction, electricity and
manufacturing as the business environment
improves. Inflation would remain contained at
an average of about 4½ percent in the medium
to long term.



The external account is expected to benefit from
increased capital inflows as the business climate
improves. The current account deficit would
decrease to around 14 percent of GDP by 2017,
largely financed by foreign direct investment.
No debt relief is assumed under the alternative
scenario.



The fiscal path is projected to generate cash
surpluses averaging 1½ percent over the
medium term, mainly reflecting higher diamond
revenue as transparency in the sector improves,
a declining wage bill (as a percent of GDP)
reflecting payroll control measures and
containment of wage increases at or below
inflation. This would enable a more sustainable
fiscal path allowing for the rebuilding of fiscal
buffers and the international reserves, while
improving service provision.



Enforcement of prudential requirements and
fast-tracking of the restructuring of the central
bank to enhance financial sector stability.

1/ Includes both public and private sector external debt.
2/ Derived as [r - g - ρ(1+g)]/(1+g+ρ+gρ) times previous period debt ratio, with r = nominal interest rate; g = real GDP growth rate, and ρ = growth rate of GDP deflator in U.S. dollar terms.
3/ Includes exceptional financing (i.e., changes in arrears and debt relief); changes in gross foreign assets; and valuation adjustments. For projections also includes contribution from price and exchange rate changes.
4/ Assumes that PV of private sector debt is equivalent to its face value.
5/ Current-year interest payments divided by previous period debt stock.
6/ Historical averages and standard deviations are generally derived over the past 10 years, subject to data availability.
7/ Defined as grants, concessional loans, and debt relief.
8/ Grant-equivalent financing includes grants provided directly to the government and through new borrowing (difference between the face value and the PV of new debt).
9/ Negative grant-equivalent financing stems from zero grants and negative grant elements of new borrowing, the latter of which result from higher interest rates (about 7 percent) than the assumed discount rate (4 percent).
The higher interest rate assumption is based on the non-concessional loans contracted in 2011.

1/ Coverage of public sector is nonfinancial public sector. Gross debt is used.
2/ Gross financing need is defined as the primary deficit plus debt service plus the stock of short-term debt at the end of the last period.
3/ Revenues excluding grants.
4/ Debt service is defined as the sum of interest and amortization of medium and long-term debt.
5/ Historical averages and standard deviations are generally derived over the past 10 years, subject to data availability.
6/ Negative grant elements result from higher interest rates (about 7 percent) than the assumed discount rate (4 percent). The higher interest rate assumption is based on the non-concessional loans contracted in 2011.

1/ Variables include real GDP growth, growth of GDP deflator (in U.S. dollar terms), non-interest current account in percent of GDP, and non-debt creating flows.
2/ Assumes that the interest rate on new borrowing is by 2 percentage points higher than in the baseline., while grace and maturity periods are the same as in the baseline.
3/ Exports values are assumed to remain permanently at the lower level, but the current account as a share of GDP is assumed to return to its baseline level after the shock (implicitly assuming
an offsetting adjustment in import levels).
4/ Includes official and private transfers and FDI.
5/ Depreciation is defined as percentage decline in dollar/local currency rate, such that it never exceeds 100 percent.
6/ Applies to all stress scenarios except for A2 (less favorable financing) in which the terms on all new financing are as specified in footnote 2.

1/ Includes both public and private sector external debt.
2/ Derived as [r - g - ρ(1+g)]/(1+g+ρ+gρ) times previous period debt ratio, with r = nominal interest rate; g = real GDP growth rate, and ρ = growth rate of GDP deflator in U.S. dollar terms.
3/ Includes exceptional financing (i.e., changes in arrears and debt relief); changes in gross foreign assets; and valuation adjustments. For projections also includes contribution from price and exchange rate changes.
4/ Assumes that PV of private sector debt is equivalent to its face value.
5/ Current-year interest payments divided by previous period debt stock.
6/ Historical averages and standard deviations are generally derived over the past 10 years, subject to data availability.
7/ Defined as grants, concessional loans, and debt relief.
8/ Grant-equivalent financing includes grants provided directly to the government and through new borrowing (difference between the face value and the PV of new debt).
9/ Negative grant-equivalent financing stems from zero grants and negative grant elements of new borrowing, the latter of which result from higher interest rates (about 7 percent) than the assumed discount rate (4 percent).
The higher interest rate assumption is based on the non-concessional loans contracted in 2011.

1/ Coverage of public sector is nonfinancial public sector. Gross debt is used.
2/ Gross financing need is defined as the primary deficit plus debt service plus the stock of short-term debt at the end of the last period.
3/ Revenues excluding grants.
4/ Debt service is defined as the sum of interest and amortization of medium and long-term debt.
5/ Historical averages and standard deviations are generally derived over the past 10 years, subject to data availability.
6/ Negative grant elements result from higher interest rates (about 7 percent) than the assumed discount rate (4 percent). The higher interest rate assumption is based on the non-concessional loans contracted in 2011.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

International Monetary Fund

Washington, D. C. 20431 USA

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2012 Article IV Consultation with
Zimbabwe
On September 21, 2012, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF)
concluded the Article IV consultation with Zimbabwe.1
Background
After a prolonged period of economic and political crisis, Zimbabwe’s economic stabilization and
recovery began with the end of hyperinflation in 2009, supported by the formation of a coalition
government, a favorable external environment, the adoption of the multicurrency system and
cash budgeting, and the discontinuation of quasi-fiscal activities by the Reserve Bank of
Zimbabwe (RBZ).
The economic rebound is moderating following a period of robust growth, with real GDP growth
averaging some 9½ percent during 2010–11, sustained by strong external demand for key
mineral exports and continued recovery in domestic demand. Real GDP growth in 2012 is
projected to slow to 5 percent, reflecting the impact of adverse weather conditions on
agriculture, erratic electricity supply, and tight liquidity conditions. Mining production is expected
to benefit from the lifting of restrictions on diamond exports from the Marange fields as a result
of certification by the Kimberley process. Inflation slowed to 4 percent in June 2012 from
4.9 percent in December 2011, reflecting in part some moderation in imported goods inflation.

1

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with members,
usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial information, and discusses
with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On return to headquarters, the staff prepares
a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the
Managing Director, as Chairman of the Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this
summary is transmitted to the country's authorities. An explanation of any qualifiers used in summings up can
be found here: http://www.imf.org/external/np/sec/misc/qualifiers.htm.

2
The external position remained precarious, albeit with some recent moderation in the current
account deficit. Despite higher exports, the current account deficit widened to 36 percent of
GDP in 2011 (from 29 percent of GDP in 2010), due in part to a spike in imports associated with
some one-off factors. The deficit was financed by debt-related flows, arrears, and a drawdown
of SDR holdings, as uncertainties regarding policy implementation continued to affect foreign
investment flows. Usable international reserves remained very low at 0.3 months of imports at
end-2011, amplifying the country’s vulnerability to shocks. The current account deficit is
projected to narrow to 20½ percent of GDP in 2012, as the 2011 import spike is reversed and
exports continue to expand. Zimbabwe remains in debt distress with total external debt
estimated at $10.7 billion (113½ percent of GDP) at end-2011, of which 67 percent of GDP are
in arrears. The large debt overhang remains a serious impediment to medium-term fiscal and
external sustainability.
The public finances came under pressure in 2011 and early-2012. Despite better-than-expected
revenue performance, central government operations recorded a cash deficit of 0.6 percent of
GDP in 2011 and domestic arrears accumulation of about 1 percent of GDP, due mainly to two
salary increases that raised employment costs by 22 percent, crowding out social and capital
investment. The effect of the salary hikes was compounded in early-2012 by an increase in
employee allowances and unbudgeted recruitment. Fiscal pressures were exacerbated by
significant underperformance by diamond revenues during the first half of 2012. In response to
the fiscal slippages, in July the government announced expenditure and revenue measures, as
well as a reassessment of diamond revenue flows. The measures include a hiring freeze,
suspension of a number of diamond-revenue-financed projects, increases in excises on fuel, and
enhanced monitoring of the mineral resources.
The financial regulatory framework is being enhanced after a long period of forbearance, but
financial system vulnerabilities persist. The banking system is recovering from a recent liquidity
crunch, following a period of rapid credit growth funded by unstable short-term deposits, but
liquidity remains relatively low and unequally distributed across banks. The RBZ raised the
prudential liquidity ratio from 25 percent to 30 percent by end-June 2012. Some banks,
particularly the small ones, show weak capitalization, insufficient liquidity, and low asset quality,
reflecting unsound lending practices and poor risk management. The situation of three troubled
banks came to a head in mid-2012, with the RBZ placing one in recuperative curatorship and two
surrendering their licenses. In August 2012, the RBZ announced steep increases in the minimum
capital requirements to be phased over a two-year period.
The medium-term outlook, under an unchanged policy scenario, is for growth to moderate to
average some 4 percent, although constraints on energy supply and weak competitiveness may
pose a challenge to achieving these rates. Foreign investment is likely to be hampered by a
poor business climate, uncertainties over the implementation of the indigenization policy and
political instability, while domestic investors may face difficulties accessing long-term credit. A
vigorous program of structural reform and strengthened macroeconomic management would
allow the country to sustain higher rates of growth.

3
Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors welcomed Zimbabwe’s economic recovery and stabilization in recent years.
Progress has however been uneven, and the impact of adverse weather conditions on
agriculture, an uncertain political situation ahead of elections, and a difficult global environment
pose further risks to the outlook. To achieve sustained and inclusive growth, Directors stressed
the importance of full commitment to policies focusing on strengthening fiscal management,
reducing financial sector vulnerabilities, and improving the business climate.
Directors urged the authorities to fully implement the measures announced in the mid-year fiscal
policy review, and take additional measures if necessary, to address earlier slippages and close
the financing gap. They underscored the need to rebalance the expenditure mix, especially by
containing the growth of the wage bill, to create the fiscal space needed for increased social
spending and public investment. Improving public financial management would help reinforce
expenditure control. Directors emphasized that enhancing transparency in the diamond sector,
including timely finalization and implementation of the Diamond Act, is key to strengthening
revenues and reducing fiscal pressures. They noted that a prudent medium-term fiscal
framework remains critical for restoring fiscal sustainability.
Directors welcomed actions taken to strengthen the financial regulatory framework and address
systemic liquidity. Noting recent bank failures and persistent vulnerabilities in the banking
system, they called for more proactive banking supervision and enforcement of prudential
regulations, focusing on banks with low liquidity buffers and high risk exposures. Directors
urged the authorities to fast-track the restructuring of the financially distressed Reserve Bank of
Zimbabwe. They also underscored the importance of increasing the level of reserves, over time.
Directors agreed that addressing Zimbabwe’s large debt overhang and achieving external
sustainability will require strong macroeconomic policies and a comprehensive arrears
clearance framework supported by donors. They urged the authorities to refrain from further
nonconcessional borrowing and avoid selective debt servicing as these may complicate
reaching agreement with creditors on a debt resolution strategy. Directors also cautioned
against further use of SDR holdings to finance expenditures.
Directors underscored that improving the business climate is necessary to strengthen
competitiveness, build investor confidence, and boost the growth potential. In particular, they
stressed the importance of ensuring that the indigenization and empowerment policies are
implemented in accordance with transparent rules and preserving property rights.
Directors welcomed Zimbabwe’s continued improvement in cooperating with the Fund on
policies and payments to the PRGT as this will allow the lifting of relevant technical assistance
restrictions, making it possible to advance toward negotiation of a staff-monitored program
(SMP) to support the country’s reform efforts. Most Directors indicated their readiness to
support such a lifting. Directors commended the authorities on meeting the outstanding marker
on steps towards removing irregularly hired workers from the payroll, which allowed the initiation
of a stock taking on the feasibility of the SMP. In this regard, Directors welcomed the authorities’
renewed commitment to make regular payments to the PRGT. They concurred that strong

4
implementation of recently announced measures to address policy slippages would be an
important demonstration of policy cooperation. Some Directors particularly stressed that a
credible government commitment to comprehensive reforms will be necessary before
embarking on an SMP.

Statement by Mr. Majoro on Zimbabwe
Executive Board Meeting
September 21, 2012
Introduction
On behalf of my Zimbabwean authorities, I thank the mission team for the focused and
constructive discussions on macroeconomic developments and policy issues during the 2012
Article IV Consultation mission to Harare. My authorities are also very appreciative of the
support the IMF Management and the entire staff has given to Zimbabwe over the years. As
regards the staff reports, my authorities are in broad agreement with the analysis and policy
thrust and would like the Executive Board to consider it with due regard to the severe
political and economic difficulties (both domestic and external) the country is facing even as
it tries to improve its relations with the Fund. The Fund’s support particularly in the lifting of
all restrictions on technical assistance (TA) and a favorable disposition toward a Staff
Monitored Program (SMP) is very critical to my authorities. In this sense, and based on
Zimbabwe’s improved relations with the Fund, we request the Board to lift all TA
restrictions on Zimbabwe.
Recent developments and outlook
Zimbabwe has come a long way since the hyperinflation era with an appreciable rate of
economic growth and macroeconomic stability recorded between 2009 and 2011. This was
made possible by a number of factors including policy reforms implemented, the formation
of the coalition government in February 2009, the adoption of the multicurrency system and
cash budgeting, and the discontinuation of quasi-fiscal activities by the Reserve Bank of
Zimbabwe (RBZ). This was supported by sizeable off-budget grants and a favorable external
environment. In 2011, the economy grew by an estimated 9 percent while inflation closed at
4.9 percent (year-on-year) in December. The widening of current account deficit to 35½
percent of GDP in 2011was accompanied by useable international reserves of just 0.3 months
of imports at year end. The growth rate in 2012 is, however, expected to moderate to about 5
percent mainly on account of the negative impact on agricultural production of the drought in
the south of the country and a slowdown in investment arising from uncertainty surrounding
the implementation of the indigenization policy and the political process. Inflation is also
expected to moderate further with the July figure standing at 3.9 percent while the current
account deficit is projected to narrow to 20 ½ percent on the back of moderating imports and
improved export performance.
Overall, the economic outlook is good and the growth potential is quite high. This could,
however, be dampened if the identified downside risks to growth - the possible resurgence of
political instability ahead of the elections, global economic downturn, potentially
destabilizing effects of indigenization policy on the banking system and investment, as well
as fiscal slippages and financial sector instability - materialize. My authorities are fully aware
of these risks and have taken appropriate measures to address them.

2

Public Finances
Zimbabwe lacks fiscal space. Revenue underperformance – mainly diamond revenue witnessed since the beginning of the year has put public finances under severe pressure. This
is exacerbated by expenditure overruns, weak payroll and commitment controls, irregularities
in employment practices, and losses by public enterprises due to inadequate oversight. In
response, the authorities have scaled down the 2012 budget, taken steps to improve revenue
collection, rationalize expenditure – often at the expense of growth enhancing public sector
investments - and impose stricter expenditure control measures.
The most critical of these measures is improvement in the transparency of diamond revenue.
Government is amending the relevant legislation to provide for the physical presence of the
Zimbabwe Revenue Authority (ZIMRA) personnel at mining locations to monitor the various
mining processes, including auctioning and processing of export customs documents. Mining
fees and charges, revenue retention policy, and all aspects of VAT processes are being
reviewed. Redrafting of the Income Tax legislation remains a government priority with the
Income Tax Bill already approved by the Cabinet Committee. Both the recurrent and capital
expenditures have been realigned and rationalized in line with the anticipated revenues while
the limited cash flows have been ring fenced to finance some critical capital projects. To
adequately manage the already over bloated wage bill, government has decided to maintain a
general freeze on recruitment of staff into the public service, align any wage bill reviews to
economic improvement and effectively implement the recommendations of the public service
audit and conclude work on it.
Financial Sector Policies
The Zimbabwean financial sector has improved since the introduction of multicurrency
system in February 2009 coupled with efforts to enhance the financial regulatory framework
and recapitalize banks. Both deposits and credit to the economy have increased albeit
modestly, although the lending rates are quite high. The banking sector is relatively sound
and safe except for three banks – Interfin which is under curatorship, Genesis which has been
deregistered, and Royal bank that has been closed for operating in an unsound manner.
Overall, the weak and troubled banks are few, small in size and of low systemic importance
although the impact of their failures on the banking public is enormous.
In spite of these positive developments, financial sector vulnerabilities persist. There are
evidences of high credit risks, deteriorating asset quality, high non-performing loans, uneven
distribution of deposits, liquidity crunch, and poor quality of corporate governance. This is
compounded by the delay in the completion of the RBZ restructuring, and the RBZ’s limited
capacity to perform lender of last resort (LOLR) functions.
The authorities are working assiduously to address these vulnerabilities. Already a phased
recapitalization plan for all banking institutions through end-June 2014 is in place with a
provision for merger and/or acquisition in the event that some banks fail to meet the
recapitalization deadline. The RBZ is also strengthening its oversight (financial and

3
regulatory) and liquidity management activities including through enhanced supervision and
upward review of both the minimum prudential liquidity requirement and capital
adequacy/tier 1 ratio in line with Basel III requirements. The recent directive for repatriation
by banks of funds held in offshore accounts has helped improve liquidity in banks.
Government, through the Ministry of Finance is finalizing amendments to the Banking Act to
improve RBZ’s oversight and surveillance over the financial sector and to also strengthen the
Troubled and Insolvent Bank Resolution Framework. To further improve liquidity in the
economy, Government issued bonds in March 2012 to reimburse the commercial banks for
the US$83 million statutory reserves blocked at the RBZ. These bonds which are tradable
have a maturity period of 2-4 years. Government has also established a US$150 million
“LOLR Fund” in which private investors are expected to contribute US$120 million while
the Ministry of Finance will contribute US$30 million (including $7 million already in the
RBZ). The fund is meant to deal with emergency liquidity requirements of fundamentally
solvent entities. The remaining challenge is identifying the private investors and establishing
strong safeguards on accountability and governance of the Fund. Restructuring of the RBZ
including the removal of both non-core assets and liabilities from the RBZ’s balance sheet is
receiving adequate attention.
External sustainability and debt
The external position remains precarious with substantial balance of payments deficit, limited
international reserves, and excruciating debt overhang. While current efforts to increase
export earnings albeit modestly, and moderate import growth are encouraging, the likely
surge in food imports due to the drought which affected agricultural production, and debt
service requirements - in the phase of dwindling foreign capital inflows - would put severe
pressure on external sustainability. Already the Joint IMF/World Bank DSA shows that
Zimbabwe’s overall public debt is unsustainable going by the current fiscal policies and the
current size and evolution of the debt stock.
My authorities are deeply concerned about the situation, particularly the issue of public debt
to international financial institutions and contracting of new non-concessional loans. While
the latter can be justified by the need to finance critical growth enhancing infrastructural
projects given death of new credit lines to the country on concessional terms, the former is
not in any way acceptable by my authorities. It is in this sense that the Zimbabwe
Accelerated Arrears Clearance, Debt and Development Strategy (ZAADDS) was put in
place. This was followed by a High Level Debt Forum hosted by the African Development
Bank in Tunis on 23 March 2012, and a Forum with Development Partners held on the sidelines of the April 2012 IMF/World Bank Spring meetings in Washington DC. The aim is to
accelerate arrears clearance and secure debt relief thereby creating opportunities for new
financing and normalizing relations with creditors. So far, the outcome is quite encouraging
as creditors and development partners have expressed their willingness to assist Zimbabwe.

Structural Reforms
My Zimbabwean authorities are committed to structural reforms. They understand that
consistency in macroeconomic policies and a transparent legal and regulatory environment
are prerequisite to sustained economic growth and development. In this regard, Government
is taking measures to address uncertainties surrounding the implementation of the
indigenization policy and the infrastructure deficit as a way of improving the business
environment. Already some aspects of the Indigenization and Empowerment Regulations are
being reviewed with a view to harmonizing and fine-tuning gray areas, including those
relating to the Banking sector. Government has also ring-fenced expenditure on critical
infrastructure projects - power, water, roads, railways, and information and communication
technology - under its emergency response package. Overall, my authorities are of the view
that the implementation of sound macroeconomic policies under the Zimbabwe Accelerated
Re-engagement Economic Programme (ZAREP): 2012-2015 will support and sustain
inclusive economic growth.
Relations with the IMF
Normalizing relations with the Fund and other IFS is of great importance to my authorities.
As indicated in the Staff report, both Fund staff and the authorities agreed that the two
markers for initiating discussions on a Staff Monitored Program (SMP) - adequate data
reporting and removal of “ghost workers,”- had been met. The recent report from the Public
Service Commission (PSC) indicates that some 6,000 irregularly employed youth officers
have been removed from the payroll and that red flags raised in the Payroll and Skills audit
have been either explained or addressed. The authorities have also resumed regular payments
to the PRGT in line with previous commitments. Three payments totaling $7.5 million have
so far been made in 2012. There is also a commitment by the authorities to persevere with
efforts to address the identified policy slippages going forward. All these point to
Zimbabwe’s improved relations with the Fund: a situation which opened the way for joint
staff/authorities stocktaking exercise on the road to a possible SMP during the just concluded
2012 Article IV Consultation mission to Harare.
Finally, I would like to stress that my Zimbabwean authorities regard SMP as very critical to
their economic restructuring and inclusive growth efforts. They are also aware that getting
SMP depends on the lifting by the Board of all restrictions on technical assistance (TA) to
Zimbabwe imposed in June 2002 which itself is also dependent on the favorable assessment
by staff, and the conviction by the Board that Zimbabwe’s cooperation with the Fund has
improved. We are of the view that Zimbabwe has done enough to warrant lifting of these
restrictions. In this regard, we urge the Executive Board to consider lifting the TA restrictions
which will pave the way for the commencement of discussion with the Zimbabwean
authorities for a Staff Monitored Program.
