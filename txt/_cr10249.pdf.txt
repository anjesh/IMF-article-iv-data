UNITED STATES
Staff Report for the 2010 Article IV Consultation
Prepared by the Western Hemisphere Department
(In consultation with other departments)
Approved by Nicolás Eyzaguirre and Tamim Bayoumi
July 2, 2010
EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
Context: The economy is recovering thanks to unprecedented macroeconomic policy stimulus, emergency financial
stabilization measures, and a gathering cyclical upswing. But the expansion is subdued by historical standards, owing to
balance-sheet headwinds in the financial and household sectors. And risks are tilted to the downside, notably those
emanating from spillovers associated with sovereign strains in Europe.
Assessment: Authorities need to cautiously complete the exit from extraordinary policy support and decisively deal with
long-term legacies, namely fiscal imbalances and (as identified in the Financial Sector Assessment Program (FSAP))
gaps in financial regulation, to secure stable medium-term growth, limit adverse international spillovers, and contain
risks of new financial excesses.
Policy recommendations:
Macroeconomic stimulus: maintain stimulus in 2010 while the recovery is still gaining traction; but in 2011, make the
planned down-payment on fiscal consolidation (with flexibility on the size of adjustment if risks materialize). Balancesheet headwinds and tail risks (including deflation) call for a cautious monetary exit.
Fiscal stabilization: develop a credible plan for stabilizing debt/GDP over the medium term, which would entail a larger
adjustment than under the authorities’ budget path, without jeopardizing the recovery. A credible plan would have three
elements—an upfront adjustment (the planned adjustment in 2011 would be appropriate under staff’s baseline outlook),
clear commitment to future measures (perhaps by enshrining targets in legislation), and further entitlement reforms—
with tradeoffs among them if necessary, say in a downside risk scenario. Over the long term, the aim should be to put the
debt ratio on a downward path.
Financial reform: banks remain vulnerable to shocks and will need additional capital to lend when credit demand
recovers. Tighten regulation to lower systemic risks (with more robust consolidated supervision, stricter standards on
systemic institutions to discourage systemic size and complexity, and an improved resolution mechanism), implement
promptly steps to revitalize securitization, and quickly bring a macro-prudential focus to the council of regulators.
Authorities’ views: Authorities have a more optimistic economic outlook than staff, and correspondingly see the
required medium-term fiscal adjustment to be smaller, but broadly agree with the challenges ahead. Fiscal stabilization
and strong implementation of financial reforms are priorities.
Analytical work: Background studies cover shocks to structural unemployment, risks of a jobless recovery,
determinants of savings rate, debt accumulation and interest rates, the fiscal gap, and an evaluation of housing finance in
the United States.
Staff: The team comprised David Robinson (head), Charles Kramer, Marcello Estevão, Nicoletta Batini, Oya Celasun,
Andrea Maechler, Martin Sommer, Evridiki Tsounta, Grace Bin Li (all WHD), Francesco Columba, John Kiff (both
MCM), and Ashok Bhatia (SPR). Brad McDonald and Mika Saito (SPR) contributed with advice on trade policy and
Joseph Myers and Steve Dawe (LEG) with analysis on AML/CFT issues.

I. BACKDROP: BACK FROM THE BRINK
1.
Thanks to a massive policy response to the worst financial crisis since the Great
Depression, the U.S. economy is recovering, but further decisive policy action will be
needed to address the policy challenges stemming from the crisis. The 2009 Article IV
consultation pointed to three such policy objectives: economic and financial stabilization;
exiting extraordinary support; and dealing with long-term legacies of the crisis (fiscal
sustainability and reforming financial regulation):
a.
On stabilization, output is recovering thanks to an unprecedented
macroeconomic policy response—policy rates cut to near zero and the largest
peacetime fiscal expansion on record (Figure 1). This response, along with capital
injections in major financial institutions, emergency lending, stress tests, and
guarantees, has also stabilized financial conditions and broken the adverse macrofinancial spiral (Figure 2, Figure 3). By the same token, however, economic and
financial conditions remain dependent on policy support. And downside risks,
including U.S. real estate markets and sovereign stress in Europe (and renewed
market focus on fiscal sustainability), have increased.
b.
On exiting extraordinary support, the authorities have largely—and deftly—
exited their exceptional measures to stabilize the financial system, with few ripples in
financial markets. Macroeconomic policies remain appropriately accommodative,
although preparations for the exit are well advanced. In particular, the Fed has
skillfully communicated its exit strategy, thus underpinning confidence in a smooth
unwinding of monetary stimulus. Fiscal stimulus would remain in place this year,
with the exit envisioned to begin in 2011.
c.
On long-term legacies, progress has been made but more remains to be done.
Draft financial reforms broadly address the issues raised in the FSAP assessment.1 A
major health care reform that dramatically expands coverage and introduces costcontainment measures has been passed, fiscal institutions have been strengthened, and
the proposed budget incorporates structural measures that would make progress
toward stabilizing the debt over the medium term. However, these measures are
insufficient to stabilize debt over the medium term, and the effectiveness of health
reforms in containing costs—a major driver of fiscal imbalances—is highly uncertain.

2.
The key policy challenge is to balance continued support for the recovery with
progress in dealing with long-term legacies. In the near term, macroeconomic policies
should maintain support for growth, with monetary policy remaining accommodative as
fiscal consolidation begins in 2011. Steps to strengthen the fiscal strategy are needed as well,
to underpin credibility in medium-term fiscal sustainability; over the medium term,
additional adjustment will be needed to stabilize debt, including further action on
entitlements. And financial sector reforms must be implemented and operationalized strongly
to prevent the reemergence of financial excesses over time.

II. RECOVERING AGAINST HEADWINDS: STIMULUS VERSUS BALANCE-SHEET STRAINS
3.
Starting in the second half of 2009, massive macroeconomic stimulus overcame
the prevailing balance-sheet strains, and the U.S. economy emerged from recession
(Table 1). Cumulative GDP growth totaled 1.9 percent (unannualized) over the second half,
compared with a peak-to-trough decline of 3.7 percent, with a further rise of 0.7 percent
(unannualized; 2.7 percent, annualized) in the first quarter of 2010. This turnaround reflected
three main factors:

Unprecedented macroeconomic stimulus. The Federal Reserve cut its target
rate to an all-time low of 0–25 basis points, signaled that the rate would remain at
exceptionally low levels for an extended period, and (via liquidity and credit-easing
measures) doubled its balance sheet. In February 2009, the Administration launched
the largest stimulus package on record—the American Recovery and Reinvestment
Act of 2009—totaling about 5 percent of one year’s GDP during 2009–11, with later
measures adding to stimulus. Overall, stimulus added over 1 percent to growth in
2009, with a smaller effect expected in 2010, and negative contributions starting in
2011.

Emergency financial stabilization. Financial conditions have improved
substantially from highly stressed levels, on the back of measures to stabilize
financial markets, capital injections, guarantees, and stress testing. The authorities
have also expanded measures aimed at mitigating the surge in foreclosures. However,
financial conditions remain on the tight side, especially for small and medium-sized
enterprises that rely on financing from smaller banks (hit hard by commercial real
estate losses), and for segments dependent on the still-weak private securitization
markets.

A strong inventory cycle. As the crisis reached extreme levels, businesses
slashed inventories, shaving 3¾ percent (seasonally adjusted at an annual rate) off
GDP growth in the first half of 2009. In the second half, however, they sharply
slowed the rate of depletion, with the result that inventories contributed a mirrorimage 3¾ percentage points to growth in the fourth quarter, and a further
1½ percentage points in the first quarter of 2010.

8
4.
The result was a strong bounce in
stimulus-related components of GDP
(Figure 4). Auto purchases surged in the third
quarter of 2009 thanks to the “cash for clunkers”
subsidy program, contributing a full ¾ percentage
point to growth. Residential investment posted a
strong increase through the first quarter of 2010,
on the back of favorable financing conditions and
tax breaks for home purchases, reversing an
unprecedented 15 straight quarters of decline.
Overall, the U.S. rebound was relatively strong
compared with that in other G7 countries.

But even with massive stimulus, the recovery is modest by historical standards
(Figure 5). The United States has

real estate continues to contract, and state
and local government spending is under pressure due to balanced-budget arrangements that
effectively rule out a countercyclical response. Meanwhile, private sector deleveraging
continues.
6.
The global collapse in trade brought about a sharp narrowing of the U.S.
current account balance. U.S. exports and imports both contracted sharply, with the result
that the current account balances dropped precipitously from about 5 percent of GDP in the
pre-crisis years to about 3 percent in 2009. The composition of financing shifted sharply as
well, with sizeable flows into U.S. treasury securities amid a “flight to quality” (which also
triggered a sharp appreciation in the dollar). More recently, trade and capital flows have
recovered, but the current account remains modest relative to pre-crisis levels.

7.
With economic slack large, core inflation has remained low. Against the backdrop
of high unemployment and a wide output gap, headline CPI inflation has recently trended
around 2 percent y/y, with some volatility owing to swings in fuel prices. Meanwhile, core
inflation has declined significantly to about ½ percent on a 3-month SAAR basis.
8.
One striking feature of the recovery has been the persistent weakness in the
labor market (Figure 6). The unemployment rate is higher than in any postwar period save
a brief point in the 1980s, while unemployment duration, the percent of long-term
unemployed, and the number of involuntary part-time workers are all at record highs. The
level of long-term unemployment is particularly worrisome, as it erodes labor skills and thus
could add to structural unemployment while reducing lifetime earnings. Looking ahead, labor
reallocation is apt to be slow, given the evidence of heightened skills and geographical
mismatches, which are estimated to have raised equilibrium unemployment rates across
states and in the nation as a whole (Selected Issues Paper, Chapter I). In addition, underwater
mortgages (where debt exceeds the value of the house) seems to have been impeding
geographical reallocation by making it difficult for homeowners to sell their houses so that
they can move in search of better job prospects.
9.
Meanwhile, unemployment is feeding fragilities in the housing markets
(Figure 7). Housing starts have stabilized, but remain around historical lows, and well below
the replacement rates implied by demographic trends. Broad measures of housing prices
seem to have bottomed out, at 30 percent below peak, but register at best subdued growth.
Meanwhile, mortgage delinquency rates continued to climb in the first quarter of 2010, and
foreclosure supply remains large; in April 2010, distressed sales accounted for one third of
existing home sales, and about 2.5 million houses were in foreclosure.2 But even these
figures understate housing stress, as mortgages in serious delinquency have run far ahead of
foreclosures, against the background of enhanced foreclosure mitigation efforts, as well as
indications that banks are struggling to process a backlog of foreclosures. As a result, some
1.7 million homes may be in the “shadow foreclosure” stock that could hit the market in the
future, depressing home prices.3 Negative equity problems could also hinder housing
recovery and pose vulnerabilities, with more than 11.2 million residential properties with
mortgages in negative equity at the end of the first quarter of 2010.4

2

There are about 130 million housing units in the United States.

3

The Fed’s June 2010 “Beige Book” noted that “tight credit, the elevated inventory of homes available for sale,
and the "shadow inventory" of foreclosed properties on banks' balance sheets held back residential development
in the New York, Cleveland, Atlanta, and Chicago Districts.”
4

There are over $600 billion in negative equity in home mortgage loans for which the borrower owes at least
25 percent more than what the house is worth.

10.
On the other hand, corporate balance sheets have been relatively strong
(Figure 8). Corporate leverage has come down, and profits have rebounded notwithstanding
the collapse in demand, as companies slashed investment and payrolls during the downturn.
Accordingly, productivity surged, with annualized growth in nonfarm output per hour
peaking at 7¾ percent in the third quarter of 2009, and unit labor costs dropping by 5 percent
in the fourth quarter. Thanks to their strong balance sheets, large companies have been able
to tap capital markets for equity and debt, bypassing the weakened banking system. As a
result of this restructuring, the attendant strength in profits, and renewed access to capital
markets, corporations have ramped up investment spending, supporting demand.
11.
Financial conditions have been volatile, with a Europe-related partial
retrenchment after an initial recovery. After bottoming out in March 2009, stock markets
continued to rise steadily, recovering over 60 percent of what they had lost since the
beginning of the crisis. But starting in early April 2010, concerns about contagion from the
European sovereign debt crisis fueled a broad market sell-off, with sharply lower equity and
commodity prices, wider corporate spreads, and a surge in market volatility. Short-term
funding spreads shot up sharply, but remained well below Lehman-crisis levels. Meanwhile,
a “flight-to-quality” has pushed the 10-year Treasury bond yield from 3.9 percent at endApril to below 3 percent in June, while the dollar has gained about 6.4 percent against the
euro since end-April.
12.
Securitization activity has remained subdued, due to a combination of low
demand and uncertainty about regulatory reforms. In particular, weak house prices and
record high delinquency rates continued to hold back the revival of private-label residential
mortgage-backed securitization. Overall, ABS issuance totaled $53 billion over the first five
months of 2010, similar to the amount during the same period in 2009 and compared with
$431 billion in the same period of 2006.

13.
Looking ahead, balance-sheet strains in the household, financial, and public
sectors pose headwinds to growth.

Household saving has ranged above pre-crisis levels as households attempt to
rebuild net wealth following a major shock (100 percent of GDP), albeit with some
volatility (peaking at 6.4 percent in May 2009 before declining) (Figure 9).
Households continue to deleverage, and saving may have further to rise before the
process of balance-sheet repair is done (Selected Issues Paper, Chapter II).

Financial institutions have managed to rebuild capital ratios, in part by
shedding risk. But with default and charge-off rates still high, the accrual of fresh bad
assets has run ahead of provisions. As a result, uncovered bad assets continue to rise
to high levels. Moreover, FSAP analysis notes that under an adverse scenario almost
half of bank holding companies experience some capital shortfall.

The public sector balance sheet has expanded rapidly, with federal debt held by
the public nearly doubling between 2007 and 2010 to 64 percent of GDP—the highest
since 1950, when debt was inflated by the legacy of World War II.
III. THE OUTLOOK: ELEVATED RISKS
14.
The staff’s outlook is for a continued gradual recovery, with inflation contained
but stubbornly high unemployment. With financial conditions improving more than
expected, global growth above expectations, and recent data having registered stronger than
prior staff forecasts, staff projects GDP growth to rebound from -2.4 percent in 2009 to
3¼ percent in 2010 and about 3 percent in 2011,with renewed growth in consumption and a
substantial upswing in business fixed investment. Inflation pressures would remain muted,
against a backdrop of a sizeable output gap. The unemployment rate would decline only
moderately, remaining above 9 percent in 2011.
15.
Over the medium term, potential growth would remain below trend for a
period, with a permanent output loss owing to the financial crisis. The staff’s forecast is
informed by analysis, including in the World Economic Outlook, that points to permanent
output losses following financial and housing crises.5 Similarly, analytical studies (including
the accompanying Chapters I and III of the Selected Issues paper) indicate that labor-market
adjustment is apt to be slow, and the forecast incorporates a temporary rise in structural
unemployment. The forecast also factors in short-run effects from the sharp recent decline in
investment (which weighs on capital accumulation). Over time, growth would move toward
medium-term potential, estimated by staff at 2¼ percent.

Medium-term shifts in savings and investment would broadly offset each other,
stabilizing the current account over the medium term (Table 2). The current account
shrank amid the crisis as rising private saving and falling private investment more than offset
the increase in public dissaving. Over the medium term, household saving is expected to rise
further, as households rebuild wealth lost in the financial and housing crisis, and save more
in light of fiscal imbalances. Adding to the rise in national saving, the fiscal deficit would
narrow as the cycle improves, stimulus expires and budgetary measures come into place.
Private investment would rebound to around pre-crisis averages as a percentage of GDP. On
balance, the current account would remain around 3½ percent of GDP over the medium term.
17.
In turn, the outlook for the U.S. external imbalance has implications for the
dollar. The current account would remain somewhat below long-run saving/investment
norms as assessed by the Coordinating Group on Exchange Rates (CGER), which estimates
the dollar to be about 9 percent above its medium-term equilibrium level on that basis.6 The
net foreign asset position implies that the dollar is about 13 percent above equilibrium, while
the equilibrium exchange rate approach (an assessment based on fundamentals such as
productivity differentials and terms of trade) finds the dollar to be close to equilibrium. In
discussions, the authorities noted that the exchange rate remained market determined, and
they did not take a view on its valuation relative to fundamentals.

The authorities—to varying degrees—viewed staff’s forecasts as too pessimistic.
Treasury and OMB officials cited the historical experience with V-shaped economic
recoveries (which implied a stronger rebound than in even the Treasury’s above-consensus
forecasts). They believed that the crisis would not have lasting output effects, given the
robust policy response and the flexibility of the U.S. economy, citing the recent strength in
productivity as evidence for the economy’s resilience. Looking ahead, they saw output
returning to its long-term trend over the medium term, with potential growth in the 2½ to
2¾ percent range—just below the average for the ten years prior to the crisis.

Overall, the mission saw risks as tilted to the downside in the near term, while
the authorities saw them as more balanced (Figure 10). The mission expressed concerns
about the foreclosure backlog, which when realized could push down housing prices,
aggravating negative macro-financial linkages7 (Box 1). Macro-financial feedback could
also occur via stress in commercial real estate: small to medium sized banks exposed to the
sector could experience outsized losses, crimping credit provision to the SMEs that borrow
from such banks. In addition, the sharp rise in government debt increased vulnerabilities to
financial market sentiment. The authorities held a more sanguine view on domestic risks,
noting ongoing foreclosure-mitigation efforts and heightened supervisory attention to
commercial real estate exposures. On the upside, it was agreed that activity (notably housing
and business fixed investment) could rebound faster from depressed levels, and confidence
could recover briskly, spurring consumption spending. Risks from strains in Europe ranked
high for both the mission and the authorities—and for the mission, tilted the balance to the
downside. Both saw tail risks that financial stress would intensify, then spread to the U.S.
financial system via interbank and derivatives markets. Deflation was another tail risk, given
high economic slack.
IV. POLICY CHALLENGES: COMPLETING THE EXIT AND ADDRESSING LEGACIES
20.
Policies should focus on completing the exit and dealing with long-term legacies,
to attain stable medium-term growth, limit international spillovers, and avoid future
financial excesses:


The near-term challenge is timing the exit from macroeconomic stimulus. Given
the remaining weaknesses in the economy, the authorities should maintain policy
stimulus in 2010. The withdrawal of macroeconomic stimulus will need to be tuned to
the speed of the recovery. However, given the risks posed by budgetary imbalances,
the ground should be laid for fiscal consolidation, with a determined start made in
2011; meanwhile, monetary policy can maintain an accommodative stance to offset
fiscal drag.



And steps are needed to deal with the legacies of fiscal imbalances and
shortcomings in financial regulation. A credible and strong consolidation plan is
needed to anchor confidence in fiscal sustainability, particularly in light of the risk of
an adverse reaction in bond markets if fiscal sustainability concerns heighten, and in
view of high dependence on foreign inflows. And far-reaching financial sector
reforms are required to avoid the re-emergence of financial excesses that could
exacerbate future fiscal imbalances.

7

A retrenchment in housing markets could also have fiscal implications; Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac estimate
that a 5 percent drop in housing prices would result in $18 billion and $3 billion, respectively, in losses (so far
they have received federal support totaling $145 billion as of end-March 2010).

Box 1. U.S. Housing Market: A Fragile Recovery
The housing market has stabilized, but most activity indicators remain near record low levels
(Figure 7).

Housing starts have bottomed in early 2009, stabilizing at historically low levels—around
600,000 per year—well below replacement levels implied by demographics, and almost onefourth their peak.


Existing home sales, on the other hand, have somewhat recovered from their record low
levels in early 2009 (when they were down 38 percent from their peak levels), though their
recovery has been particularly volatile—with data pointing to a massive retrieval following
the expiration of the homebuyers’ tax credit. Despite the increasing sales in the last year—
aided by the most favorable affordability conditions in 40 years—they remain 20 percent
lower than their peak levels.

The house price correction also appears near its end but foreclosures and negative equity
remain a major concern. The Case Shiller 20-city composite price index (that takes into account
non-conforming loans) has been rising since mid-2009; though it has experienced marginal declines
in some of the recent months amid the expiration of the homebuyers’ tax credits. Despite their
ongoing improvement, house prices are 30 percent below their 2006-peak levels and are not expected
to have a strong recovery in the coming quarters, with record-high foreclosures and underwater
mortgages, and a large shadow inventory putting a drag on price growth. Specifically, according to
Realty Trac, there have been 1.6 million foreclosure filings in the first five months of this year, with
2010 numbers estimated to surpass the record 2.8 million recorded in 2009. Overall foreclosure
activity surpassed 300,000 for the last 15 straight months, despite reports that banks are intentionally
forbearing foreclosures (with a shadow inventory estimated at between 1.7 and 7 million homes) and
numerous policy measures enacted by the Administration. Over 11 million mortgage properties are
now underwater, with an estimated negative equity value of $800 billion.
The Administration has undertaken numerous measures to tackle the foreclosure epidemic, but
so far their impact has been below expectations, given the complexities of the problem and
capacity constraints by servicers. The Home Affordable Modification Program (HAMP) which
reduces monthly payments on existing first lien mortgages and provides financial incentives for
servicers and investors to perform sustainable modifications had a slow start; now accounting for
350,000 permanent modifications out of the 1.5 million modifications extended through May.
Particularly problematic have been second lien mortgages that lenders have been reluctant to write off
(to be facilitated by the recently enacted Second Lien Modification Program), and heavy nonmortgage household debts. Short sales and deed-in-lieu are now encouraged for borrowers unable to
complete a modification by the now launched Home Affordable Foreclosure Alternatives Program,
while new welcome measures would be implemented by fall. These include the Alternative Principal
Write-down Approach which subsidizes principal writedowns to mortgages over 15 percent
underwater, while the Federal Housing Administration (FHA) offers a new refinance option allowing
principal write-downs for non-FHA insured underwater mortgages. A temporary forbearance period
of up to 6 months would also be offered to unemployed borrowers.
In case the housing market destabilizes again, more policy action would be warranted. Policy
options could include expanding the loan modification program, including by providing additional
incentives to investors and services and loosening some of the eligibility requirements, as well as
increasing further the subsidies on principal writedowns. Allowing mortgages to be renegotiated in
courts (“cramdowns”) is another policy option, as staff advocated in the past.

23
A. Fiscal Stabilization
21.
The mission saw a key macroeconomic challenge as ensuring that public debt is
put—and is seen to be put—on a sustainable path without jeopardizing the recovery
(Box 2). Under current policies, federal debt held by the public could rise from 64 percent to
95 percent of GDP by 20208 (Table 3). Thereafter, the rising impact of population aging and
health-care inflation would push debt higher, swelling over 135 percent of GDP by 2030 and
continuing to trend up thereafter. While Treasury interest rates were low owing to underlying
economic weakness and flight to quality, over the medium term, these factors would unwind
(Box 3 and Selected Issues Chapter IV). Thereafter, the trajectory for public debt could
engender a rise in interest rates that would dampen U.S. growth and risk adverse spillovers to
global financial conditions.

The authorities stressed their commitment to fiscal stabilization, as laid out in
the draft FY2011 budget. They aimed to halve the deficit by 2012, and achieve primary
balance by 2015, with an objective to stabilize the debt just above 70 percent of GDP. Under
their economic assumptions, the envisioned adjustment was highly ambitious—a decline of
8½ percent of GDP in the primary deficit by FY2015, and included measures such as a freeze
on non-security discretionary spending and partial expiration of 2001 and 2003 tax cuts.
Moreover, the budget would imply a sizeable up-front adjustment—2 percentage points of
GDP—in FY2011. The results would be even more favorable should growth surprise on the
upside—a nontrivial risk in the authorities’ view, as they saw their forecasts as conservative.

8

Staff fiscal projections adjust the authorities’ budget projections for staff’s growth, inflation, and interest-rate
assumptions.

24
Box 2. Outlook for Federal Government Finances
Federal debt is on an unsustainable trajectory.
Under the draft FY2011 budget, the federal primary
deficit is projected by the authorities to shrink to
about 1 percent of GDP in FY2015. However,
federal debt held by the public would continue to
rise, reaching 77 percent of GDP by the end of
decade. The authorities have indicated their
intention—including by establishing a fiscal
commission—to find additional savings of about
1 percent of GDP. Under their macroeconomic
assumptions, this strategy would eliminate the
primary deficit and stabilize federal debt relative to
GDP.

Proposals for Fiscal Year 2011; and Fund staff estimates.

The budgetary outlook is bleaker under the staff’s more pessimistic macroeconomic
assumptions. Since the financial crisis is
expected to lead to a permanent loss of
output and budgetary revenues, the primary
deficit would remain around 2 percent in
FY2015. Federal debt would exceed
95 percent of GDP by the end of the decade,
approaching the levels last seen in the
aftermath of WWII, putting upward pressure
on interest rates. A primary balance would
therefore be insufficient to stabilize debt—
roughly a ¾ percent of GDP primary surplus
would be needed instead. Phasing in further
savings of about 2¾ percent of GDP starting
from FY2013 would stabilize the federal
debt held by the public around 75 percent of
GDP.1
Additional measures will be necessary to put the debt ratio firmly on a downward path in the
longer term given rapidly-growing health care costs and population aging. Bringing the federal
debt-to-GDP ratio back to the pre-crisis level by 2030 would require a gradual adjustment in the
primary balance of about 6 percent of GDP relative to the staff’s baseline deficit projections.2
______________________________
1

The required adjustment would rise by about ¾ percentage point of GDP for each 1 percentage point increase
in interest rates and decline by roughly ¼ percentage point for each 1 percentage point increase in output level.
2

This calculation incorporates potential savings from the recent health care reform, as assessed by the
Congressional Budget Office (½ percent of GDP a year during the next decade). These savings are deemed
highly uncertain.

25
Box 3. Who Will Finance the U.S. Federal Budget Deficits?
Fiscal financing costs have recently been restrained due to cyclical and safe haven
factors, despite rapidly rising debt. The low required rate of return has so far been
underpinned by factors such as higher private saving, weak corporate investment, subdued
inflation, and a flight of investors to the relative safety of U.S. government bonds amid the
sovereign bond market distress in Europe. Recent Fed purchases of Treasury debt (and
closely-substitutable GSE debt) have also helped to hold down interest rates. Going forward,
however, given the large expected T-bond issuances, financing conditions will tighten as
private investment recovers and safe haven flows abate.
A detailed analysis of investment flows1 suggests that, in the future, the bulk of T-bond
purchases will need to be made by domestic

Thus, over the medium term, higher real interest rates will likely be needed to
encourage the implied portfolio shifts. Staff assumes—in line with the empirical
literature—that one percentage point of GDP in excess supply increases long-term bond
yields by 2–5 basis points. The debt effect could therefore raise long-term interest rates by
60–150 basis points. Adding this effect onto the yield increases due to normalization of
monetary policy and term premia leads to the staff’s medium-term projection for the 10-year
bond yield of about 6½ percent—more than 1 percentage point above the forecast by the
Office of Management and Budget. The eventual recovery in the housing sector and the
attendant stronger issuances of closely-substitutable GSE-backed debt present an upside risk
to the staff’s medium-term projections. That said, the near-term movements in yields are
highly uncertain as U.S. Treasury debt continues to benefit from its safe haven status.

23.
The mission welcomed the authorities’ commitment to fiscal stabilization but
observed that much remained to be done to achieve it. Staff’s economic assumptions
imply that a federal primary surplus of ¾ percent of GDP is required to stabilize debt,
requiring roughly 2¾ percent in measures above those in the draft FY2011 budget. Part of
this could be achieved through expenditure reductions, but revenue measures would also be
needed. These could include relatively “growth friendly” options such as further cuts in
deductions, particularly for mortgage interest; higher energy taxes; a national consumption
tax; or a financial activities tax (which could also mitigate systemic financial risks). Looking
beyond 2015, the aim should be to put public debt firmly on a downward path to rebuild the
room for fiscal maneuver.

24.
The mission observed that the timing and composition of fiscal adjustment
would need to be carefully designed to minimize the impact on demand while ensuring
credibility. A credible fiscal plan would have three elements:


An upfront adjustment in FY2011;



a clear commitment to the additional future measures needed, for example, by
enshrining targets and/or measures in legislation, under credible economic
assumptions; and



further steps to address entitlement pressures, given the uncertain payoffs from health
care reforms (Box 4), which hinged on difficult and/or untried measures; notably,
reforms could address imbalances in social security, where the needed measures are
well known and the payoffs more certain.

27
Box 4. Health Care Reform
The main challenge facing the U.S. health care system is an unsustainable rise in
spending. The United States has the highest per capita health spending in the OECD (almost
two times and a half the average) and spending continues to rise—rising over 40 percent in
real terms in the past decade alone, with health spending expected to reach 28 percent of
GDP in 2030 in the absence of reforms according to the CEA. Despite high spending, health
outcomes in the United States are less favorable than in many OECD countries, and there are
around 50 million non-elderly uninsured individuals.
High spending reflects soaring health-care costs. The Congressional Budget Office (CBO)
estimates that in the last two decades annual per capital health costs growth rate exceeded per
capita nominal GDP growth rate by 1.4 percentage points on average. Moving forward, in the
absence of reforms, Medicare and Medicaid spending are projected to grow by 6.4 percent
annually, while private health care costs would rise by 6 percent (both in real terms).
A health care reform launched in March aims to tackle these challenges. The reform will
expand coverage to 32 million legal non-elderly uninsured (reaching insurance coverage to
94 percent of that population by 2019). The measures are largely financed by: (i) reductions
in the growth of Medicare’s payments to providers; (ii) increases in payroll taxes for
Medicare and expanding Medicare tax on investment income; (iii) fees on the medical
community and an excise tax on expensive health plans (in addition, the bill forbids
insurance companies from denying coverage for pre-existing conditions).
The bill includes welcome cost containment measures. Such measures include the
formation of insurance exchanges to spur competition between insurance plans; the
“Cadillac tax” on expensive insurance plans, studies of comparative effectiveness of
treatments; reducing Medicare payments to providers; standardization of insurance
administration (starting in 2013), and the creation of the Independent Payment Advisory
Board (IPAB); a bi-partisan committee mandated to provide cost-cutting recommendations
(that could become law) whenever the Medicare per capita growth rate exceeds a target
growth rate, starting in 2014. CBO projects savings of about 1 percent of today’s GDP over
this decade, with savings in the following decade of up to one-half percent of GDP per year.
However, the envisioned savings remain uncertain and would hinge on the
implementation of many of the untried and/or politically difficult cost containment
policies. In particular, the reform entails significant decreases in Medicare payment rates to
health care providers that may prove difficult to implement (since others, in the past, had
been substantially backloaded), while the “Cadillac tax” plans is deferred to 2018. IPAB’s
effectiveness also remains unclear since the Committee cannot recommend rationing of
services or changing eligibility requirements. For these reasons, it will be essential for IPAB
to monitor costs closely, and take remedial measures if needed.

28
25.
In the short run, the mission saw the budget’s proposed fiscal tightening of
2 percent of GDP in 2011 as appropriate under the baseline outlook. The budget
“placeholder” for additional stimulus provided some flexibility to respond to risks, which if
needed could be utilized to partially offset the fiscal drag from the fading effects of past
stimulus (reducing growth by about ½ percentage point in 2011). In addition, if downside
risks materialized, there existed some room to trade off a lower up-front adjustment with
measures to strengthen medium-term credibility (such as further entitlement reforms, which
would have little immediate impact on demand). The mission also saw a case for carefully
targeted measures, to support job creation and (if the housing market weakened) foreclosure
mitigation, although these should also be kept within the budget envelope.
26.
The authorities saw their plans as striking the right balance between near-term
support for the recovery and medium-term credibility. In the near term, they saw a need
for additional stimulus to cushion the impact from the withdrawal of the 2009 stimulus
package, particularly given the continued weaknesses in labor markets and state finances.
Consistent with this, the budget incorporated a placeholder ($282 billion) to allow further
stimulus over FY2010–12, within the overall envelope defined by the draft FY2011 budget.9
For the medium term, the authorities saw their plan as strong and credible, as it incorporated
a sizeable adjustment; moreover, market demand for treasuries remained brisk, and yields
low (the authorities were taking the opportunity to increase the average maturity of debt,
which was at the low end for peer countries). In this context, they saw legislated fiscal targets
as unnecessary. However, they reaffirmed their commitment to stabilize debt over the
medium term, and would adjust policy as needed to achieve that aim—for example, if growth
undershot expectations (although they saw the staff-estimated adjustment as excessive, based
on overly gloomy forecasts).
27.
The authorities saw two institutions—the Fiscal Commission and (on medical
care) the Independent Payments Advisory Board (IPAB)—as playing key roles in
shaping the medium-term adjustment.


9

The Fiscal Commission is considering all possible consolidation options to achieve
the targeted 1 percent of GDP in savings needed to reach primary balance, with
Social Security reforms among the options. The Commission is also deliberating
appropriate medium-term and longer-term fiscal targets. The mission underscored
that finding a super-majority of votes (14 out of 18 members) for the Commission to
issue its final set of recommendations could prove challenging and the authorities
should be actively considering a “Plan B”. For example, the Administration could
include in the subsequent budget any recommendations which had broad support or
failed only by a narrow margin.

The 2 percent adjustment during FY2011 is inclusive of this placeholder (e.g., it partially offsets the larger
underlying fiscal withdrawal).

29


The authorities stressed that the IPAB had a very powerful mandate—its
recommendations will be implemented unless Congress votes them down. They also
were optimistic about the likely fiscal savings from the new health care legislation,
observing that past CBO scoring of health-care reforms had often erred on the low
side, stressing the numerous measures now in place, and expressing confidence in the
ability of the IPAB to push through tough cost-control measures. The mission noted
that the envisioned savings remained highly uncertain, and would hinge on the
implementation of many untried or difficult measures. Accordingly, the IPAB would
play a key role in monitoring and remediating excess cost growth, and consideration
should be given to other measures such as reducing tax exemptions for employer
health insurance contributions if excess cost growth persisted.

28.
Meanwhile, state and local governments were under severe stress, with the risk
of default by selected municipalities. Balanced budget rules imparted a major procyclical
impulse, only partly offset by higher transfers from the federal level. Weak revenues have
forced local authorities to aggressively increase tax rates and cut services. Pressure to
consolidate is likely to persist going forward, given the prospects for weak labor and housing
markets and waning federal budgetary support. In addition, lower asset values have deepened
financing gaps (estimated at over $1 trillion) in state and local pension and health care
obligations, calling for reforms that would cover unfunded liabilities by streamlining benefits
and raising contribution rates, while moving away from defined-benefit pension schemes.
B. Financial System: Health and Stability
Risks and balance-sheet strength
29.
The mission noted that the financial system was far stronger than a year ago, but
might not be in a position to lend to support growth when credit demand revived. Bank
capital fell sharply during the crisis, then rebounded, thanks to private capital raising as well
as public capital injections. But about half of the increase in risk-weighted capital ratios since
the depths of the crisis reflected risk reduction—a shift from loans to Treasury securities—
that would reverse as the recovery proceeded; risk weighted assets were now at an all-time
low relative to total assets.
30.
The mission saw the financial system as still vulnerable to shocks. FSAP stress
tests showed that around one third of the top 50 BHCs would experience some capital
shortfall under moderately-sized shocks to the economy. The mission also raised concerns
about reports of rollover of loans to commercial real estate borrowers (a recent Fed survey
had shown increased use of loan extensions), amid widespread weaknesses in the sector.
Regarding residential real estate, the mission also noted the very high level of underwater
mortgages posed risks of strategic defaults and further losses to banks and MBS investors.
Moreover, financial instability in Europe—while a tail risk—could have a sizeable impact on

30
U.S. financial institutions (Box 5). Such risks could weaken financial-institution balance
sheets and thereby add to headwinds to growth, especially in light of prevailing weaknesses
(including elevated non-performing asset (NPA) ratios, subpar profits, and a historically low
level of provisions relative to NPAs) (Table 4).
31.
Supervisory agencies were aware of the balance-sheet risks but saw them as well
managed. Supervisors were attentive to the risk that banks were evergreening CRE loans,
and indeed, recently had concerns that banks were cutting exposures to viable borrowers. On
residential real estate, the present rules limited the ability of banks to provision against the
risk of strategic default in performing underwater loans (supervisors felt that most defaults
were still driven by economic circumstances). Overall, these issues were well on supervisors’
radar screens, the credit cycle was turning around, and banks had the balance-sheet strength
to weather the rest of the cycle. While pockets of vulnerability remained, notably among
small banks heavily exposed to CRE, these were under close monitoring.
32.
Against this background, the mission considered that banks would need to raise
more capital to be able to lend as credit demand revived, and thus support the recovery.
Releveraging and risk taking by banks once net lending revived would necessarily be
associated with either a decline in capital ratios—which (based on Tier 1 common capital)
were not at especially high levels by historical standards, particularly for smaller banks—or
an increase in the level of capital. In addition, the weak level of private-label securitization
limited the ability of banks to offload risk from their balance sheets. Banks would also
eventually need more capital to satisfy the coming higher regulatory capital ratios, in light of
domestic and international initiatives to strengthen capital requirements. Supervisors were
satisfied with the level of capital but did not want to see capital ratios decline. They believed
the strong capital raising efforts of the banks have rebuilt system capital to levels sufficient to
support credit growth (even in the SCAP adverse scenario), and they observed that markets
remained open to the banks to increase capital further if they found themselves constrained.
While they acknowledged that some individual institutions may be less well-positioned to
absorb future losses through earnings they saw the staff’s views as too pessimistic. In
addition, they noted that banks have plans to expand lending and that profits will improve as
provisioning eases with the turn in the credit cycle.

31
Box 5. U.S. Exposures to Europe
Financial market strains stemming from the sovereign pressures in Europe are being felt in U.S.
markets. With risk aversion on the rise, interbank liquidity and credit spreads have climbed significantly,
while CDS spreads for major U.S. financial institutions have picked up, and stocks have fallen. U.S.
mutual funds have cut their exposure (via CP markets) to European banks, and shortened maturities, and
there are indications that longer-term real money investors such as pension funds are also pulling back
from European markets. Corporate bond spreads have widened out, and in May, corporate bond issuance
fell sharply amid volatile market conditions. Meanwhile, flight to quality flows have lifted the dollar and
pushed down treasury yields.
These financial market pressures raise the question of how exposed the U.S. economy is to Europe
via trade and financial linkages. With relatively low trade openness, the United States has very limited
export exposure to GIIPS, and modest exposures to the Euro area and the United Kingdom. Any further
demand contraction in these economies would therefore have a noticeable but small impact on U.S.
economic activity through the export channel.

Financial linkages with Europe are much stronger, however. For instance, U.S. banks’ claims on
GIIPS are about 4 percent of financial assets but slightly more than 60 percent of Tier-1 capital. Claims on
larger European economies, including the U.K., account for 30 percent of total assets, and close to
450 percent of tier-1 capital. Financial conditions in the U.S. could therefore tighten considerably if
financial market strains were to spread from the GIIPS to the larger European economies, with potentially
severe consequences for economic activity. In addition, there remain important uncertainties about
possible channels of transmission—including derivatives markets, for which data are relatively limited.

Regulatory reform
33.
During the mission, the Congress was considering a sweeping overhaul of
financial regulation, covering many of the key priorities laid out in the FSAP analysis
(Box 6):


A broadening of the prudential regulatory perimeter to include all systemic
institutions and markets;



an interagency financial surveillance council (Financial Services Oversight Council
or FSOC) charged with identifying and responding to emerging risks to financial
stability;



a strengthened resolution mechanism that covers non-banks and requires systemic
institutions to prepare resolution plans (“living wills”);



tighter capital and liquidity ratios, with higher ratios for systemic institutions;



risk retention (“skin in the game”) for securitizations to improve incentives for sound
underwriting and bundling;



steps to improve transparency and counterparty risk management in the OTC
derivatives markets;



increased accountability and transparency for ratings agencies, particularly for the
process of rating structured securitization products.

34.
The team underscored that assuming the legislation passed the key would be
strong implementation. In particular, the FSOC would need to quickly develop a common
macro-prudential vision—a nontrivial task, given that only two of the nine voting members
(Treasury and Fed) have a macroeconomic remit. To be effective, the FSOC would also need
a culture of transparency and cutting-edge thinking on financial stability. To this end, regular,
broad-based stress tests—along the lines of the SCAP stress test performed in 2009—and
publication of periodic financial stability reports that include stress tests and identify
financial stability issues would be helpful. The team saw strong roles for both the Treasury
and Fed in the FSOC to integrate financial and macroeconomic analysis. And strong
coordination across agencies would be essential, as the U.S. financial regulatory framework
remained overly complex, leaving risks of gaps and duplication.

33
Box 6. Key Findings and Recommendations of the U.S. FSAP Assessment
The U.S. FSAP assessment took place at a critical juncture. With the financial system just
recovering from a major crisis and with far-reaching reforms under deliberation in Congress,
the team was presented with unique challenges in assessing systemic risk and unique
opportunities to address regulatory issues.
The stability analysis points to remaining vulnerabilities. Capital buffers are thin and will
likely remain under strain even in the baseline macroeconomic scenario, given the lagged
effects of the economic downturn on credit quality, new regulatory demands, and continued
deleveraging. Small and midsize banks seem particularly at risk given their exposures to the
commercial real estate sector.
Against this backdrop, the FSAP team makes a number of specific policy
recommendations:
 Crisis management, resolution, and safety nets: The team supports efforts to legislate a
new resolution mechanism allowing regulatory intervention of large complex financial
groups. The team also proposes measures to strengthen the deposit insurance system, and
argues for the articulation of principles governing future Fed liquidity provision to nonbanks.
 Regulation and supervision: The team stresses the need to strengthen U.S. financial
oversight in areas such as risk management and consolidated supervision. The regulatory
perimeter needs to be widened to better encompass the shadow banking sector, especially in
derivative, repo, and other off-exchange markets. Fed responsibilities for systemic financial
infrastructures also need clarifying.
 Systemic oversight: The team welcomes proposals to establish an FSOC with a formal role
for the Treasury, and with the Fed as its “lead executor,” supervising all potentially systemic
bank or nonbank financial groups. These steps should bring greater clarity to inter-agency
processes for monitoring and limiting systemic risk. Strong implementation will be key.
 Supervisory architecture: The exceptional complexity of the U.S. supervisory system and
the multiplicity of agencies involved risks gaps, overlaps, and inefficiencies. Accordingly,
the team suggested bolder steps to streamline the system—going beyond those presently
contemplated by the Congress—including establishing a single federal agency to supervise
all commercial banks and thrifts, and a single agency to regulate all securities and
derivatives transactions.
The FSAP team urges determined action to address the “too-big-to-fail” problem. It
supports a range of measures under consideration by the authorities to discourage excessive
size and complexity of financial groups, including: progressively stricter standards for capital,
liquidity, and risk management; critical review of “living wills” with a view to simplifying
complex group structures; credible contingency plans built around the new dissolution
authority; and incentive-compatible compensation and governance rules.
U.S. credit policies are also identified as a key reform priority. Longstanding measures to
promote access to credit and home ownership—most notably through the housing GSEs—have
skewed competition, complicated supervisory mandates, and fostered excessive risk taking.
Early steps to addresses these issues and resolve the position of the housing GSEs are needed.

34
35.
Regulation of systemic institutions and markets would need to be especially
rigorous, to contain the externality of systemic risk and mitigate moral hazard. In
particular, regulation of systemic institutions—including capital and liquidity ratios—should
be tight enough to disincentivize systemic size and complexity (Figure 11). Similarly, “living
wills” should be vetted thoroughly; if the will for a particular institution cannot be credibly
implemented in a crisis, that institution should be streamlined (as allowed for in the
legislation). Finally, the envisioned improvements in transparency of OTC derivatives
markets will be essential, as will arrangements to centralize counterparty risk managements,
to prevent these markets from serving as a channel of interbank contagion during crises.
International coordination will be important, in the context of work by the Financial Stability
Board and other fora on systemic firms, cross-border resolution, and capital standards.
36.
The authorities broadly agreed with these priorities, with differences on a few
issues. They observed that the multiplicity of regulators, while complicating coordination,
also suited the diversity of the U.S. financial system, and even offered “multiple pairs of
eyes” to diagnose financial issues. Moreover, attempting to reduce the number of regulators
further would have faced practical constraints and risked delaying reforms. The FSOC would
help with coordination among supervisors. In addition, features of the legislation—
accountability to Congress, the Treasury secretary acting as chair—would help to promote
the right culture in the FSOC. They saw living wills as a supervisory tool that could be used
to understand the set of risks facing an institution, relate those risks to the firm’s
organizational and legal structure, and thus allow the planning of a more orderly resolution.
The Fed was instituting organizational changes to bring a more comprehensive,
multidisciplinary approach to its financial surveillance, as well as enhancing discussion of
financial stability issues in its monetary policy meetings. It would likely produce an internal
financial stability report initially, with publication as an option later.
37.
The mission stressed that reforms to the framework for securitization should be
prioritized to spur the return of this important market. Draft legislation appropriately
emphasized reform of the rating agencies, increased transparency and better-aligned
incentives. The mission noted that, given the large role that securitization played in the past,
and the potential to limits to bank balance sheets in creating credit, speedy implementation
would be essential to avoid constraints on credit supply that could crimp the recovery. It
would also be important to coordinate reforms domestically and internationally to ensure safe
securitization and promote a level playing field.

38.
The mission noted that the housing finance system, meanwhile, awaits further
reform (see Selected Issues Chapter V). The system is costly (enjoying the second single tax
expenditure, almost $640 billion dollars over 2011–15, largely accruing to the better-off),
inefficient and complex, with numerous interventions and subsidies that do not seem to
translate into a sustainably higher homeownership rate. In this connection, the mission
welcomed the ongoing review of the housing finance system, including the review of tax
expenditures. It argued for reforms to the GSEs’ ambiguous public/private status—which
proved unsustainable—and saw benefits in streamlining the GSE’s mandates and privatizing
the retained portfolio, which had been the source of past losses and bore little relation to the
core bundling and guaranteeing businesses. Those lines, which arguably could provide public
goods, should be made explicitly public. The authorities noted that the ongoing review of the
housing finance system would take up a number of these issues. In the meantime, it had
become clear that a more balanced approach was needed, with greater market participation;
in addition, the implicit GSE guarantees would be made explicit. Reforms would aim to
ensure wide access to homeownership; protect consumers; preserve financial stability; and
safeguard affordability for low- and middle-income borrowers.
C. Monetary Policy: Engineering a Smooth Exit
39.
The mission observed that the move toward the monetary policy exit had gone
smoothly so far, thanks to deft management by the Federal Reserve. In staff’s view, in
light of lingering financial strains, subpar growth, and risks to the outlook (including
deflation), the Fed had appropriately maintained the policy target at an all time low while
signaling that conditions would likely warrant exceptionally low levels of the policy rate for
an extended period. Meanwhile, it had wound down most of its emergency facilities (the
Term Asset Backed Securities Lending Facility expired on June 30, 2010, while it had
revived its dollar swap facilities in light of interbank strains emanating from Europe) and also
ended the $1.7 trillion Large-Scale Asset Purchase Program10—all without leaving noticeable
ripples in markets.
40.
Federal Reserve officials considered that inflation remained subdued, and the
downside risks had recently increased. With inflation expectations well anchored and the
Phillips curve relatively flat, the baseline was for moderate (but positive) inflation. They
noted the downside risks to demand, including from Europe, which could exacerbate
disinflationary pressures; that said, they saw little risk of a sustained period of outright
deflation. In the event that further monetary stimulus were called for, policy responses could
include a strengthened commitment to maintain ultra-low policy rates for an extended period,
which would lower long-term interest rates as forward rate expectations fall. Expanding asset
purchases and relaunching facilities to aid markets in case of renewed stress would be other
options, which the Fed felt it could do quickly.
10

Under this program, the Federal Reserve purchased $1.25 trillion of agency MBS, about $175 billion of
agency debt, and $300 billion of longer-term Treasury securities, as of March, 2010.

38
41.
The mission and authorities agreed that the Fed was well placed to manage the
uncertainty surrounding the monetary exit. The Fed was developing over time a well
diversified tool kit for managing monetary conditions. Fed officials thought that increasing
IOR could on its own tighten monetary conditions quite effectively, even if reserve levels
remained elevated. They saw as the main uncertainty whether the IOR would pass through
fully to comparable increases in the fed funds rate in the presence of high levels of reserves.11
To help address this uncertainty, the Fed was in the process of developing and testing reverse
repos against a broad range of collateral and with an expanded set of counterparties, as well
as term deposits. The use of these tools would reduce reserves, tightening the relationship
between IOR and other short-term rates. Other uncertainties included the level of reserves
consistent with more normal operations further in the future. Officials did not anticipate the
need for active asset sales at this stage; roll-off of securities could reduce excess reserves
(which stood at about $1 trillion) by $340 billion through end-2011.12 The mission agreed,
noting the importance of continued skillful communication to manage expectations about the
exit.
42.
As to the post-crisis operating framework, the Fed saw several options—including
a corridor or floor system—but felt it was too early to judge which would be preferable. As it
moved through the exit, its experience would inform the choice of regime in the post-crisis
world. The mission agreed, emphasizing the importance of continued clear communication
about how the Fed saw the transmission mechanism and about its choice of policy targets. It
also observed that it would be useful to transfer as soon as possible to the U.S. Treasury the
assets purchased in the context of institution-specific support. Another issue is the interplay
between the conduct of monetary policy and the Fed’s expanded role in financial stability;
the Fed Chairman has stated that if reforms proved inadequate or dangerous financial risks
built up, the Fed must remain open to using monetary policy to address those risks,
proceeding cautiously and always keeping in mind the inherent difficulties.
D. Role of the United States in the Global Economy
43.
The mission observed that a multilateral approach to economic policy
management would be as important in the recovery as in the crisis. It welcomed the
authorities’ continued work to coordinate with other policymakers in international fora. The
mission also noted the authorities’ efforts to promote international financial and economic
stability (most recently through the Fed’s redeployment of its dollar swap lines to foreign
central banks, in response to dollar funding strains caused by sovereign stress in Europe).
11

The fed funds rate had remained below the IOR for some time, owing to unremunerated parties in the system,
and limited arbitrage by banks.

12

The Federal Reserve projects that about $200 billion of agency debt and MBS and $140 billion of Treasury
securities will mature by the end of 2011.

39
44.
The mission stressed that the key contributions that the United States can make
to global growth and stability are raising savings and strengthening the financial sector
(Figure 12). Higher savings—in particular, through fiscal consolidation—can help to ensure
that the current account deficit remains within sustainable levels, and avoid higher U.S.
interest rates that would adversely affect global financial conditions. Strengthening the
financial sector can both support U.S. growth and curtail the risk of future financial
imbalances that could be detrimental to U.S. and global financial stability. That said, with
household saving apt to rise over the medium term, the United States could no longer play
the role of global consumer of last resort, underscoring the importance of measures to boost
demand in current account surplus countries. With the U.S. dollar now (in the mission’s
view) overvalued from a medium-term perspective, this growth rebalancing would need to be
accompanied by greater exchange rate flexibility elsewhere.
45.
The authorities agreed on the need for a global rebalancing of demand, which
they did not see as underway at present. Relatedly, they saw a substantial risk of deficient
global demand, particularly if—as some were concerned—fiscal exits were unduly rapid and
uncoordinated. In this connection, they saw the G-20 Mutual Assessment Process (MAP)
exercise as a useful way to promote focused international discussions on global economic
policy issues and encourage coordination. They agreed that U.S. fiscal consolidation had a
large contribution to make over the medium term, and concurred that currency flexibility in
surplus countries would be an essential ingredient of global rebalancing.
46.
The mission encouraged the authorities to redouble their efforts to conclude the
Doha Round of trade negotiations. Staff welcomed the limited U.S. recourse to
protectionism (a notable exception being the safeguard measures against Chinese tires) and
called on the Administration to continue to apply the Buy America provisions in the stimulus
bill as narrowly as allowed and to roll back quickly discretionary import safeguard measures.
Emphasis by the U.S. on a strong multilateral trade system with enhanced trade policy
monitoring initiatives was helping to ensure that new trade measures were not a major drag
on the global economic recovery; in this regard, the authorities’ goal of doubling exports
over five years—while ambitious in quantitative terms—sent an important and appropriate
signal of the need to sustain and, where possible, to increase openness. An early conclusion
of the Doha Round would support an increase in U.S. exports and help contain the risks of
renewed protectionism. The authorities’ focus in trade negotiations remained firmly on
expanding jobs and economic growth by creating new export opportunities; present Doha
Round offers, in their view, did this inadequately.

V. STAFF APPRAISAL
47.
Aided by a massive policy response, economic recovery is underway, but further
efforts are needed to secure a strong and durable expansion. The crisis raised three main
policy challenges: economic and financial stabilization; exit from extraordinary support; and
dealing with long term legacies (fiscal sustainability and financial reform). With the recovery
still dependent on policy support, sizeable downside risks to the outlook, and long-term
legacies not yet fully addressed, further decisive action is needed to achieve stable mediumterm growth and limit the risk of adverse international spillovers.
48.
In this context, the challenge is to balance continued support for the recovery
with progress in dealing with long-term legacies. Strong macroeconomic support remains
appropriate for this year, given the remaining weaknesses in demand, stubbornly high
unemployment, and lingering financial strains. On the fiscal side, stimulus should be
maintained in 2010 as planned, and the envisioned withdrawal in 2011 is appropriate under
the baseline outlook. Monetary support can be sustained for an extended period, given
quiescent inflation risks, and to help offset fiscal drag that would begin next year. If
downside risks materialized, a smaller up-front fiscal adjustment could be undertaken,
complemented by further measures to bolster medium-term credibility (such as entitlement
reforms) and further monetary accommodation.
49.
A key challenge is to ensure that public debt is set on a credible, sustainable
path. Over the medium term, the debt/GDP ratio is set to rise over the medium term to levels
not seen since the years immediately following the Second World War, with further upward
pressures thereafter owing to swelling entitlement spending. The authorities’ commitment to
fiscal stabilization is welcome, but under staff’s economic assumptions, a major adjustment
will be needed to stabilize the debt/GDP ratio by 2015, entailing both expenditure and
revenue measures. Against this background, it is important that the adjustment envisioned for
2011 is accompanied by an appropriately strong commitment to medium-term stabilization,
including (e.g.) legislated targets and further steps on entitlements. Looking beyond 2015,
fiscal policy should aim to put public debt on a declining path relative to GDP, to rebuild
room for maneuver.
50.
On entitlements, the recent health-care reform provides a welcome basis for cost
control, but the payoffs from its measures are highly uncertain. Many of the envisioned
measures are difficult, or untried—and the present unsustainable rate of health-care cost
inflation presents the major risk to long-run fiscal stability. Accordingly, it will be essential
for the Medicare cost commission (IPAB) to closely monitor health care costs; and the
authorities should take remedial action if needed, such as cuts in exemptions for insurance
premiums. In addition, further action should be taken on social security, where the needed
measures are well known and the payoff more certain.

42
51.
The other major task for policy is financial sector reform. Risk-based capital
ratios have rebounded strongly, but in part due to de-risking, while the risks to banks remain
sizeable. With private securitization markets still impaired, banks may lack the balance-sheet
strength to lend strongly when credit demand recovers. In this context, it will be important
that banks fully recognize the risks on their balance sheets and have sufficient capital to
support the ongoing recovery.
52.
Draft legislation makes major steps to address regulatory gaps—the key now is
prompt and strong implementation. Priorities should include prudential rules that
disincentivize systemic size and complexity, and steps to streamline systemic institutions that
cannot be resolved under stress. In addition, financial surveillance under the FSOC needs to
quickly develop a common macroprudential focus, as well as a culture of transparency and
cutting edge analysis. Close coordination among regulatory agencies will be crucial, as the
draft reform misses the opportunity to consolidate the overly complex array of U.S. financial
regulators, leaving risks of gaps and duplication. Improving transparency and containing
counterparty risks in OTC derivatives markets will also be essential. Moreover, steps are
needed to revitalize private securitization, given its large role played in the past and the limits
to bank balance sheets in creating credit. Relatedly, reforms to the housing finance system
remain unfinished and the move to clarify the GSE’s status as public entities is useful. Over
time, their mandates should be streamlined to bundling and guarantees.
53.
The Fed is well placed to manage the uncertainty of the monetary exit. Its
expanded toolkit should allow it to navigate smoothly the uncertainties about the
transmission mechanism and the efficacy of individual tools. In addition, it has credibly
communicated its commitment to sustaining appropriately accommodative monetary
conditions even as it has introduced tools to prepare for the later exit. Continued clear
communication about its strategy and operations will be essential as the exit evolves.
54.
The United States has a key role to play in promoting a multilateral approach to
economic policy management. The authorities’ leading role in multilateral fora is welcome,
as are their efforts to promote international stability. For the medium term, the key
contributions that U.S. economic policy can make to global growth and stability are fiscal
consolidation (which would limit the external imbalance) and strengthening its financial
sector. On the trade policy front, the U.S. authorities’ limited recourse to protectionist
measures is welcome and they are encouraged to redouble efforts to conclude the Doha
round.
55.

Staff proposes to hold the next Article IV Consultation on a 12-month cycle.

VII. Exchange Rate Arrangements: The exchange rate of the U.S. dollar floats
independently and is determined freely in the foreign exchange market.
VIII. Payments Restrictions. The United States accepted Article VIII of the IMF's
Articles of Agreement and maintains an exchange system free of restrictions and multiple
currency practices with the exception of limited restrictions on certain payments and transfers
imposed for security reasons. The United States currently administers approximately 30
economic sanctions programs, which restrict certain payments and transfers for transactions
against particular foreign governments, entities, and individuals. The United States
administers, inter alia, sanctions programs relating to Burma, Cuba, Iran, North Korea, and
Sudan, and continues to block certain previously frozen assets of the former Yugoslavia.
Several other sanctions programs, including those relating to Côte d’Ivoire, Liberia, Somalia,
Syria, Western Balkans, and Zimbabwe are “list-based” programs, affecting only members of
certain government regimes and other individuals and groups whose activities have been
determined to threaten the foreign policy or economy of the United States. The United States
also implements similar list-based sanctions programs against: narcotics traffickers;
terrorism-related governments, entities, and individuals; and proliferators of weapons of mass
destruction.

Article IV Consultation. The 2009 Article IV consultation was concluded in
July 2009 and the Staff Report was published as IMF Country Report 09/187. A fiscal ROSC
was completed in the context of the 2003 consultation. An FSAP was conducted during the
Fall of 2009 and Spring of 2010. The FSSA will be discussed at the board, together with the
2010 Article IV Consultation, on July 26, 2010.
The 2010 Article IV discussions were conducted from May 11–June 28. Concluding
meetings with Chairman Bernanke of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System
and Treasury Secretary Geithner occurred on June 21 and 28. A press conference on the
consultation was held on July 8, 2010. The team comprised D. Robinson (Head), C. Kramer,
M. Estevão, O. Celasun, A. Maechler, M. Sommer, N. Batini, E. Tsounta, and G. Bin Li (all
WHD); A. Bhatia, B. McDonald, and Mika Saito (all SPR); F. Columba and J. Kiff (all
MCM); and J. Myers and S. Dawe (LEG). Ms. Lundsager (Executive Director) and Mr. Lin
(Advisor) attended some of the meetings. Outreach included discussions with the private
sector and think tanks. The authorities have agreed to the publication of the staff report.

Annex II. Statistical Issues
Statistical Issues: Comprehensive economic data are available for the United States on a
timely basis. The quality, coverage, periodicity, and timeliness of U.S. economic data are
adequate for surveillance. Coverage of international capital flows in external sector statistics
has been improved, with the June 2007 releases of BOP and IIP data on financial derivatives.
The United States has subscribed to the Special Data Dissemination Standard (SDDS) and its
metadata are posted on the Dissemination Standard Bulletin Board (DSBB).

Statement by the IMF Staff Representative on the United States
July 22, 2010
1.
This note reports on information that has become available since the staff report
(SM/10/189) was issued and does not alter the thrust of the staff appraisal.
2.
Incoming data since the completion of the Article IV consultation in mid-June
point to a continued but subpar recovery, with further downside risks to the staff’s
forecast. First-quarter GDP growth was revised down by 0.5 percent (saar), mainly owing to
weaker final demand. Recent data also indicate softening consumer confidence, dwindling
tailwinds from the inventory cycle, weak private sector employment growth, and reduced
housing activity on the expiry of the homebuyer tax credit. In addition, imports picked up
strongly relative to exports in June, although this could partly be attributable to temporary
factors such as the expiry of an export VAT rebate in China. All told, activity in the second
quarter has been weaker than expected, with GDP growth in the second quarter of 2010
tracking below the WEO estimate. On fiscal policy, the Senate has approved another
temporary extension of unemployment benefits, and the authorities plan to unveil their midsession budget update on Friday, July 23.
3.
The Dodd–Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 was
cleared to be signed into law by President Obama. Most major provisions of the Dodd–
Frank Act—the new inter-agency Council, the resolution mechanism for systemic financial
firms, the wider regulatory perimeter and stronger consolidated supervision, and the new
regulatory framework for derivatives market—are in line with U.S. FSAP recommendations,
which was conducted as this law took shape. That said, as flagged in the FSAP, the
U.S. regulatory system remains complex, and the effectiveness of the reform will hinge on its
implementation.
4.
Risk aversion continues to drive financial conditions. Stock prices have fallen
below end-2009 levels, the dollar remains elevated relative to the start of the year, and
Treasury yields have declined on flight to quality. Consumer credit fell in June and a Fed
survey recorded easier credit terms, although terms remained tighter than at end-2006.
Second-quarter earnings for financial institutions were largely disappointing, with meager
trading revenues, and continued high (albeit easing) credit costs.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2010 Article IV Consultation with the
United States
On July 26, 2010, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded
the Article IV consultation with the United States.1
Background
Thanks to a massive policy response, the U.S. economy is recovering from the worst
financial crisis since the Great Depression. Monetary policy has maintained a highly
accommodative tilt, with policy rates near zero and asset purchases that have helped to
ameliorate financial strains. Fiscal policy has been very stimulative, with the American
Recovery and Reinvestment Act imparting stimulus of about 5 percent of GDP during 2009–
2011, supplemented by measures targeted to housing, labor and auto markets. Meanwhile,
measures to stabilize financial markets, capital injections, guarantees, and stress testing
dramatically improved financial conditions. As a result, GDP grew an average 4 percent
(seasonally adjusted annual rate) in the second half of 2009 before slowing to 2.7 percent
(saar) growth in the first quarter of 2010. The U.S. current account deficit shrank on the
back of weak domestic demand, lower oil prices, and the cumulative effect of the
depreciation trend in the dollar since early 2002.
1

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On
return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the
Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the First Deputy Managing Director, as
Chairman of the Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is
transmitted to the country's authorities. An explanation of any qualifiers used in summings up
can be found here: http://www.imf.org/external/np/sec/misc/qualifiers.htm.

2
However, the economic recovery has been slow by historical standards—consistent with
past experience in the aftermath of housing and financial crises—and the outlook remains
uncertain. In particular, private demand has been sluggish, while the unemployment rate
has receded only modestly from near post-Depression highs. As a result, inflation has
remained contained, with core inflation easing amid wide economic slack. Recent market
volatility from the sovereign crisis in Europe has tightened financial conditions somewhat
despite safe-haven flows that have reduced Treasury yields. Looking ahead, risks are
elevated and tilted to the downside (as clear from the most recent batch of economic
indicators), with particular risks from a double dip in the housing market and spillovers if
external financial conditions worsen.
Macroeconomic policies are set to remain accommodative in the near term. The draft
FY2011 budget includes allowances for further targeted support for growth, while proposing
measures aimed at reducing the deficit to 4 percent of GDP by the middle of the decade. A
new Fiscal Commission will recommend measures aimed at further reducing the deficit to
roughly 3 percent of GDP and stabilizing the ratio of debt to GDP over the medium term.
Most of the special liquidity facilities have been phased out and the Fed ended its
mortgage-backed securities purchase program without disrupting markets, while signaling
continued low policy rates for an extended period.
Progress has been made in addressing long-term challenges. The health care reform
widens coverage and introduces cost-containment measures, and seeks to reduce nearterm deficits as well as the long-term fiscal gap. The financial regulation reform, which is
broadly consistent with proposals in the IMF’s Financial Stability Assessment Program,
includes a broadening of the regulatory perimeter to all systemic institutions and markets, a
new council of regulators to improve systemic risk detection and resolution, tighter
prudential regulation parameters, and stronger resolution mechanisms for nonbank financial
institutions.
Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors noted the economic recovery underway in the United States, aided by a
massive policy response. However, with recovery still dependent on policy support, rising
downside risks, and substantial long-term fiscal and financial-sector challenges, further
decisive action is needed to achieve stable medium-term growth and limit risks of adverse
international spillovers.
Directors saw near-term tradeoffs between supporting recovery and addressing long-term
legacies. Macroeconomic support remains appropriate for this year, given still-weak
demand, high unemployment, and lingering financial strains, although the envisioned
withdrawal in 2011 is appropriate. Monetary support can be sustained for longer, given
quiescent inflation expectations and forthcoming fiscal drag. However, Directors saw scope
for a smaller up-front fiscal adjustment if downside risks materialize, complemented by
measures to bolster medium-term credibility.

3

Setting public debt on a sustainable path is a key macroeconomic challenge. Directors
welcomed the authorities’ commitment to fiscal stabilization, but noted that a larger than
budgeted adjustment would be required to stabilize debt-to-GDP under staff’s economic
assumptions, requiring revenue and expenditure measures. They urged the authorities to
accompany the 2011 adjustment with a strong commitment to medium-term stabilization,
perhaps including further entitlement reform. Some Directors welcomed the creation of the
Fiscal Commission and the Independent Payment Advisory Board as useful steps. A
number of Directors encouraged the authorities to set debt-to-GDP on a declining path in
the longer term.
Directors welcomed the health care reform, including enhanced coverage and measures to
control costs, the key long-term fiscal risk. However, with payoffs highly uncertain, close
monitoring of costs and remedial actions, if needed, will be essential. Further action is also
necessary on Social Security, where needed measures are well known and payoff more
certain.
Directors welcomed the FSAP assessment, which acknowledged that the financial system
has strengthened but remains vulnerable to shocks. Private securitization is still impaired
and banks may lack balance-sheet strength to support future credit demand. Accordingly,
banks must fully recognize balance-sheet risks and have sufficient capital to support
recovery.
Directors welcomed the major financial reform, which is broadly consistent with FSAP
recommendations, but noted that strong implementation will be crucial. Close coordination
among regulatory agencies is essential, as the reform missed the opportunity to consolidate
the complex array of regulators. Directors also underscored the importance of containing
counterparty risks in OTC derivatives markets; revitalizing private securitization; and moving
ahead with reforms to the housing finance system, including the GSEs.
Directors saw the Federal Reserve as well placed to manage the monetary exit given its
expanded toolkit. The Fed has credibly communicated its commitment to sustaining
accommodative monetary conditions while preparing for the exit. Continued clear
communication is essential as the exit evolves.
Directors saw a key role for the United States in promoting multilateral economic
management. U.S. economic policy could help secure medium-term global growth and
stability mainly through medium-term fiscal consolidation, which could also help reduce the
current account deficit, and strengthening the financial sector. On trade policy, Directors
welcomed the authorities’ limited recourse to protectionist measures and encouraged them
to redouble efforts to conclude the Doha round.
