MAURITIUS
Staff Report for the 2004 Article IV Consultation
Prepared by the Staff Representatives for the 2004 Consultation with Mauritius
Approved by Juan Carlos Di Tata and Martin Fetherston
June 18, 2004

•

The 2004 Article IV consultation discussions were held in Port Louis during March 19-April 1,
2004. The mission met with the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Finance, The Honorable
Mr. Pravind Jugnauth; the Governor of the Bank of Mauritius, Mr. Rameswurlall Basant Roi; the
Financial Secretary, Mr. Krishnanand Guptar; other senior government officials, and
representatives of the private sector and trade unions.

•

The staff team comprised Mr. McDonald (head), Mr. Yao, Ms. Kim, Mr. Mikhael, (all AFR) and
Mr. Porter (FIN). Mr. Ismael (Advisor, Executive Director for Mauritius) also participated in the
discussions.

•

Mauritius is on the standard 12-month consultation cycle. At the conclusion of the 2003 Article IV
consultation on June 30, 2003, Executive Directors noted that sound macroeconomic policies have
established the conditions for investment and growth and the strong performance of the economy
over the last two decades. Directors observed that the key challenges in the medium term will be
to: (1) explore the scope for further economic diversification; (2) address the problem of persistent
unemployment; and (3) contain the budget deficit and overall public debt in order to minimize the
risks to medium-term macroeconomic stability.

•

Mauritius accepted the obligations of Article VIII, Sections 2 (a), 3, and 4 on September 29, 1993,
and its exchange system is free of restrictions on the making of payments and transfers for current
international transactions. Mauritius also maintains a liberal capital account. It last availed itself of
Fund resources in July 1986 and settled all repurchase obligations in May 1991. Since June 2002,
Mauritius has been included as a creditor in the Fund’s financial transaction plan.

•

Appendix I presents an assessment of public and external debt sustainability. Mauritius’s relations
with the Fund, including technical assistance, are summarized in Appendix II, and its relations
with the World Bank Group in Appendix III. The quality and timeliness of Mauritius’s reporting
of core data and other economic and financial statistics are, in general, satisfactory for conducting
surveillance. Statistical issues are discussed in Appendix IV, progress toward the Millennium
Development Goals in Appendix V, and a draft PIN is included in Appendix VI.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
Following a weak growth performance in 2002/03 (July-June), real GDP is expected to
have increased by around 4½ percent in 2003/04, largely reflecting the recovery of
sugar production and strong construction activity. The overall fiscal deficit is estimated
to have declined slightly to 5½ percent of GDP in 2003/04, and the external current account
surplus to have remained unchanged at about 2½ percent of GDP. Inflation is expected to
decline to around 4 percent by the end of the fiscal year.
Real GDP growth is projected to remain under 5 percent in 2004/05, and medium-term
growth is likely to slow to around 4 percent per annum. While moderate growth is
expected in the tourism, information and communications technology (ICT), and sugar
sectors, the textile sector is expected to decline further.
Mauritius’s immediate and medium-term challenges are threefold. First, there is a need
to diversify and transform the economy, especially in light of the expected loss of trade
preferences in the sugar and textile sectors. Second, the authorities must undertake structural
reforms to lessen labor market rigidities. Third, persistent budget deficits need to be reduced
if medium-term fiscal sustainability and macroeconomic stability are to be preserved.
Medium-term fiscal consolidation is essential to avert unsustainable debt dynamics that
could jeopardize the economy’s growth prospects and macroeconomic stability. The
government should aim to stabilize the public debt/GDP ratio in 2004/05 by reducing the
deficit to around 4¾ percent of GDP. Reductions in the fiscal deficit of around 1 percent of
GDP annually in subsequent years would reduce the public debt/GDP ratio to around 66 percent by 2007/08, from above 70 percent in 2003/04. Sustainable fiscal policy would need to
be accompanied by prudent monetary and exchange rate policies to protect the economy
from downside risks.
In line with the FSAP recommendations, the authorities have taken steps to strengthen
the financial system. The government is expected to pass draft laws to revise the Bank of
Mauritius Act and the Banking Act at around the time of the announcement of the 2004/05
budget. The authorities have also taken a number of actions to strengthen the Anti-Money
Laundering and Combating the Financing of Terrorism (AML/CFT) framework.

I. INTRODUCTION AND MEDIUM-TERM CHALLENGES
1.
Mauritius’s social and economic success during the past quarter century has
been impressive. This success owes much to the high quality of institutions, including a
well-functioning multi-party democracy, an independent judiciary, and a strong sense of the
“rule of law.”1 Good institutions and appropriate policies have led to a more than doubling of
per capita income, a narrowing of income disparities, and a marked improvement in social
indicators. Since the early 1990s, however, unemployment has risen steadily, owing to labor
market rigidities and a structural skills mismatch.
2.
Remarkably, Mauritius’s development has been financed almost entirely from
domestic savings, which have been intermediated through an efficient domestic banking
system. Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) has played a minor role (Figure 1).
3.
Mauritius’s immediate and medium-term challenges are threefold. First, there is
a need to diversify and transform the economy, especially in light of the expected loss of
trade preferences in the sugar and textile sectors. Second, Mauritius must undertake structural
reforms to increase labor market flexibility. Third, persistent budget deficits need to be
reduced if medium-term fiscal sustainability and macroeconomic stability are to be
preserved.

According to the 2003 reports of the World Economic Forum and Transparency
International, Mauritius is among the top five African countries for quality of public
institutions and perception of corruption.

While the timing of the phasing out of textile preferences has been defined, there
is less certainty in the case of sugar exports. Textile quotas will be phased out with the
expiration of the WTO Agreement on Textiles and Clothing (ATC) in January 2005. Given
its relatively high per capita income, Mauritius does not qualify for the third-country fabric
provision under the U.S. African Growth and Opportunity Act (AGOA). Therefore, unlike
other nations benefiting from preferential access to the U.S. market under AGOA, Mauritius
cannot import raw fabric from non-AGOA countries, placing the country at a relative
disadvantage. The preferential access afforded to sugar exports by the European Union (EU)
is currently under review.2
4.

5.
Mauritius’s unemployment has increased rapidly since 1991 primarily among
low-skilled workers concentrated in the sugar and textile sectors.3 Unless significant labor
market reform takes place, the unemployment rate may worsen in coming years.
While external debt remains at a relatively low level, domestic public debt
sustainability is a major concern. According to sensitivity tests carried out by staff, total
public debt could become unsustainable in the medium-term in the absence of significant
fiscal adjustment, thereby jeopardizing growth prospects and macroeconomic stability.
6.

7.
The authorities’ response to the challenges identified in Fund surveillance in
recent years has been uneven. For example, while some attempt was made to enhance
prospects for medium-term fiscal sustainability in 2002/03 through the introduction of
revenue-enhancing measures, the tax base remains relatively narrow. The authorities have
also been slow to address key structural reforms, particularly with respect to the labor market
and the strengthening of the fiscal position of key state-owned enterprises. However, in the
last year, some progress was made in addressing the challenges identified by Executive
Directors during the 2003 Article IV consultation. Specifically, the authorities have: (i)
attempted to revitalize the sugar and textile sectors through the implementation of costsaving measures in the former and the facilitation of the restructuring of viable firms in the
latter; (ii) made a number of improvements in line with the FSSA recommendations, and
issued guidance notes on AML/CFT; (iii) implemented an automatic pricing mechanism for
petroleum products; and (iv) introduced the Bank of Mauritius (BOM) Bill to control
liquidity in the banking system. Undertaking further reforms in the near term will prove
difficult and will require a strong commitment by the authorities, especially in light of
upcoming elections (Box 1).

The WTO recently convened a panel to consider the challenge to the EU’s sugar export
subsidies brought by Australia, Brazil, and Thailand.

The 2000 Census reported that 90 percent of the unemployed have not completed the high
school certificate.

Box 1. Political Developments
Mauritius has a multiparty democratic system. The transfer of the premiership took
place on September 29, 2003, in line with a coalition agreement reached in 2000
between the Mouvement Socialiste Militant (MSM) of Sir Anerood Jugnauth and the
Mouvement Militant Mauricien (MMM) of Mr. Paul Bérenger. As a result,
Mr. Bérenger relinquished the finance portfolio to become the new Prime Minister to
complete the final two years of the five-year term of office, while Sir Anerood gave up
the premiership and became president. The new MSM leader, Mr. Pravind Jugnauth—
son of the president—is the new deputy prime minister and finance minister. The
opposition Labour Party’s victory in the December 2003 by-election for the National
Assembly seat vacated by Sir Anerood has given new impetus to opposition activities.
The next general election will take place in 2005.

II. RECENT ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS

8.
Real GDP growth is expected to rebound to around 4½ percent in 2003/04 (JulyJune), following a disappointing 2¾ percent in 2002/03. This largely reflects the recovery
of tourism and sugar production, the latter due to favorable weather, and continued strong
construction and transportation activity. However, high domestic production costs and
increased competition have continued to affect adversely the Export Processing Zone (EPZ)
sector, which registered negative growth for the second consecutive year. The unemployment
rate rose to 10.2 percent in 2003, from 9.7 percent in 2002.
9.
Budget execution for the first eight months of 2003/04 (July-February) was
broadly in line with the target of reducing the deficit to 5.5 percent of GDP, from
6.2 percent in 2002/03. This improvement reflects primarily higher tax and nontax revenue.

same time, the debt service
burden rose by over 40 percent from 2001/02 to 2002/03, accounting for a large share—20
percent—of current expenditure. Moreover, with most of the debt concentrated in short-term

-8-

securities, there is significant rollover and interest rate risk. Recognizing these risks, in
2003/04 the government has mostly financed its budget deficit by drawing on its deposits at
the BOM. External public debt remains relatively low at a projected 19 percent of GDP in
2003/04.
11.
The overall balance of 30 nonfinancial public sector corporations shifted from a
deficit of 0.6 percent of GDP in 2001/02 to a surplus of 0.9 percent in 2002/03.4 The
Central Electricity Board (CEB) continues to face financial difficulties, in part because of its
inability to pass on to consumers the higher international price for fuel oil—a major input in
electricity generation. The financial position of the State Trading Corporation (STC) is
expected to improve following the introduction in early April 2004 of an automatic
mechanism for adjusting the prices of petroleum products.5

12.
Low and stable inflation has generally been achieved, largely due to a relatively
successful implementation of an informal inflation targeting framework. Average annual
inflation fell to around 4 percent in 2003, from 6.4 percent in 2002, in line with the central
bank’s inflation target. The growth of credit to the private sector slowed in 2003, owing in
part to the weaker performance of the textile sector. The outlook is for a further moderate fall
in inflation over the near term, as demand pressures remain subdued.
13.
Key interest rates have been trending downward over the last two years,
although real lending rates remain high. The BOM lowered its Lombard rate in five steps
by a total of 200 basis points, to 9½ percent in late January 2004. These actions reflect the
judgment that inflationary risks have subsided, and a desire to provide a stimulus to
economic activity. However, given the weaknesses in key sectors of the economy, banks
have been cautious in advancing credit to segments of the private sector. This, together with
the drawdown in government deposits, which has not been fully sterilized by the BOM, has
led to a situation of excess liquidity in the banking system. As a result, interest rates in the
interbank market have fallen to an all-time low of less than one percent at end-March 2004,
leading to a steepness at the short end of the yield curve. Declining inflationary expectations
over the last two years have led to a gradual decline in interest rates, resulting in a reduction
in the differential between the yield curve of Mauritius and that of the U.S.
14.
The overall balance of payments surplus is projected to decline from 6½ percent
of GDP in 2002/03 to below 2 percent in 2003/04. The current account is projected to
remain in surplus in 2003/04, with a recovery of the tourism sector offsetting a widening in
the trade deficit. The capital and financial account is projected to register a small deficit of
0.8 percent of GDP in 2003/04, compared with a surplus in 2002/03. FDI flows are expected
to weaken in 2003/04.

III. REPORT ON POLICY DISCUSSIONS
15.
The policy discussions centered around the medium-term challenges of
diversifying the economy and preserving fiscal sustainability and macroeconomic
stability. The main focus was on: (i) the authorities’ medium-term strategy to improve the
competitiveness of the economy and strengthen growth prospects; (ii) the budget
performance in 2003/04, fiscal polices for 2004/05, and medium-term fiscal consolidation;
and (iii) the appropriateness of monetary and exchange rate policies.
A. Medium-Term Growth Sources and Prospects
16.
The economy is expected to grow by about 4¾ percent in 2004/05, largely led by
a continued recovery in sugar production. Tourism is expected to strengthen further,
reflecting an increase in visitor arrivals from the U.K. and India, while the expansion in the
construction sector should continue with the building of several new hotels. Other sectors
that are expected to contribute to growth include wholesale and retail trade, transport,
information and communications technology (ICT), and financial services. However, the
outlook for exports from the EPZ sector remains weak, with several large textile firms in the
process of relocating their operations to China in anticipation of the ending of the quota
system governing world trade in textiles.
17.
Medium-term growth is expected to slow to around 4 percent per annum—
significantly below the average of almost 6 percent over the past three decades. This
reflects a weaker outlook for the traditional pillars of the economy—sugar and textiles
(Box 2)—and the effects of persistent rigidities in the labor market. New sectors, such as the
ICT sector, are expected to contribute increasingly to growth but their starting point is low.
18.
The authorities expressed concern about the medium-term prospects for the real
economy, and indicated that they were taking steps to improve the outlook for the
traditional sectors while creating an environment conducive to the development of
other sources of growth. The authorities have been preparing for the potential loss of
preferences for sugar by implementing reforms to reduce gradually production costs. Major
reforms have been the introduction of a voluntary retirement scheme, which has resulted in
an almost 30 percent reduction in the workforce (7,900 employees), and the consolidation of
milling operations. Efforts are also under way to diversify sugar-related activities, including
the production of electricity as by a product of the sugar sector for sale to the national
electricity company, and rum and ethanol production. The mission encouraged the
government to intensify these efforts and to complete an ongoing mid-term review of the
sugar sector strategy.
19.
The authorities also indicated that they were assisting the restructuring of the
textile sector through technical advice and development finance. The government
remains hopeful that AGOA’s third country fabric provision will be extended to Mauritius in
the near future. However, many Hong Kong-based textile firms, which account for about 25
percent of textile employment and 30 percent of exports are likely to leave Mauritius in the

- 15 -

Box 2. Growth Impact of the Elimination of Trade Preferences1
The baseline growth projection for the medium term is 4 percent per annum. In 2004/05,
this scenario envisages a growth rate of 4.8 percent based on an increase in sugar production of
16 percent following a bumper crop in 2004, and a decline in the EPZ sector of 3.5 percent.
However, sugar production is expected to decline the following year. The weak performance of
the sugar and EPZ sectors is expected to continue into the medium term, reflecting increased
global competition, a reduction in the area used for sugarcane production, and a gradual
disinvestment of some foreign textile companies. These developments are expected to be
balanced by the capability of the Mauritian economy to adjust partially to the changing
international business environment through the restructuring of the economy and the
development of other sources of growth, including in the ICT and the financial services sectors.
The baseline scenario, however, faces several downside risks. Structural reforms could take
longer than expected; and the shocks to both the sugar and textile sectors could be even more
severe. This will depend on the resolution of the challenge to the EU sugar subsidies by
Australia, Brazil, and Thailand and developments in the textile market during the post-ATC
period.
In a moderately adverse scenario, the shocks are expected to have a more substantial but
gradual impact in the next three years. Sugar prices are assumed to fall to US$0.16 per
pound in 2005, and further to US$0.10 per pound in 2007. The textile sector would shrink by 8
percent in 2004/05, 15 percent in 2005/06, and 8 percent in 2006/07, stabilizing thereafter. The
impact of this scenario, relative to the baseline, would be to reduce GDP growth by about ¾ of
a percentage point in 2004/05, 1½ percentage points in 2005/06, and ½ a percentage point in
2006/07.
In an extremely adverse scenario, the shocks would have a much stronger impact on the
different sectors of the economy. One assumption—although with low probability—would be
for the WTO panel to decide on the complete liberalization of sugar trade starting in 2005. This
would most likely cause sugar prices to drop to around US$0.10 per pound. The other
assumption is a more dramatic impact on the textile sector following the phasing out of the
ATC preferences. This could lead to the closure of all textile firms categorized as either
vulnerable or at risk under the Textile Emergency Support Team (TEST) initiative, in addition
to the relocation of foreign and some local companies to cheaper production sites. The impact
on the textile sector would be a decline of between 20 and 30 percent in 2004/05 and 2005/06.
This scenario would lead to a reduction in the baseline medium-term growth projection by an
average of between 2-2½ percentage points a year.

next two to three years, owing to rising labor costs6 and the removal of quotas that currently
constrain exports from countries such as China. This would increase the already high
unemployment rate, and its incidence among low-skilled workers (see Box 3).7 The mission
welcomed the establishment of the Textile Emergency Support Team (TEST), which is
designed to facilitate the rehabilitation of viable textile enterprises through the provision of
corporate diagnosis services and the consolidation and streamlining of various initiatives.
These initiatives include the provision of financial resources from the National Equity Fund
for capitalization and spinning activities, as well as enterprise modernization schemes
supported by the Development Bank of Mauritius.8 The authorities agreed that there is a need
to intensify the retraining of displaced textile workers so that they can be absorbed by other
sectors.
20.
Notwithstanding prevailing uncertainties, the authorities were optimistic about
the growth prospects for the tourist sector. Plans are being implemented to construct about
20-25 hotels (representing additional capacity of about 40 percent) in the next three years.
This increase in capacity, however, is coming at a time when the hotel occupancy rate has
declined. More generally, a consistent strategy needs to be developed to market Mauritius as
a tourist destination, since the envisaged rapid expansion may conflict with preserving the
country’s image as an “upper-end” tourism product. Moreover, issues related to the
expansion of air access may need to be resolved in order to increase tourist arrivals.
21.
The government continues to view the emerging ICT sector as providing a new
source of growth for the economy over the medium term. Nonetheless, the mission noted
that the outlook for the sector appeared less favorable than a year ago, owing to considerable
global competition. The authorities indicated that, based on current commitments, the
recently completed cyber tower will have an occupancy rate of around 40-60 percent during
the first year, and that 3,000 new jobs would be created by end 2004. However, significant
uncertainty remains, as many Indian firms that initially expressed interest in establishing
operations in Mauritius seem to have changed their plans.

Hourly textile labor costs in Mauritius are three times those of Pakistan, and more than
twice those of China, India, and Madagascar.

See also the accompanying selected issues paper on labor market issues.

The mission also supported the establishment of the Corporate Debt Restructuring
Committee, which will oversee the restructuring of the debts of those firms found to be
viable. This committee has been established under the auspices of the TEST, and is chaired
by the Managing Director of the BOM.

- 17 -

Box 3. The Mauritius Labor Market1
Reforms in Mauritius’s labor market should include the introduction of decentralized
wage bargaining and the elimination of restrictions on worker redeployment and
terminations.
The labor market is highly regulated, with restrictions on the redeployment of workers,
wages and benefits, and terminations. The government establishes a separate set of labor
market regulations—which specify the duties and wages of each narrowly defined
occupation—for most industries, which inhibits the ability of firms to redeploy workers.2 The
annual tripartite wage setting process typically indexes economy-wide wage growth to
inflation, while terminations tend to be both costly and time consuming, usually requiring
approval by the Termination of Contracts of Services Board.
In addition to the relatively high unemployment, unemployed workers are facing
exceptionally long spells—with an average unemployment duration of 20 months—and a less
dynamic labor market, with relatively low quarterly job creation.
Moreover, the highly regulated nature of the labor market unnecessarily reduces the
employment opportunities for low-skilled workers. By increasing the relative wages paid to
low-skilled workers, these regulations reduce the incentive to create new jobs and make
existing jobs more insecure. Limits on the ability of firms to redeploy workers have similar
effects, while restrictions on terminations reduce the incentives to create new jobs. Although
these restrictions in particular do not apply to some key sectors—such as the EPZ sector—they
inhibit the creation of new jobs for low-skilled workers in other areas. This differential
regulatory treatment will become increasingly important as the economy adjusts to the loss of
trade preferences.
Structural changes in the market for low-skilled workers may already be becoming apparent.
The first figure below shows that 2002-03 constitutes a period of historic weakness in EPZ
employment, mainly driven by a sharp rise in the rate of job destruction. Moreover, there has
been a sharp rise in the average size of EPZ firms closing down.

B. Structural Reforms
22.
In addition to the sectoral issues described above, the discussion on structural
reforms focused on the labor market and private sector involvement in the economy.
The mission urged the authorities to move ahead with labor market reforms. The government
noted that comprehensive measures had been taken to overhaul the education system in order
to increase the access of students to educational facilities, and to improve the quality and
relevance of the curriculum at all levels, especially at the secondary school level. Staff
acknowledged that these reforms would help alleviate the skills mismatch, but stressed that
other important factors affecting the labor market also needed to be addressed. In particular,
the mission favored the adoption of firm-level wage bargaining and the simplification of the
numerous regulations governing the ability of firms to redeploy and terminate workers. The
authorities agreed on the importance of reforming the various labor market institutions, but
indicated that it was difficult to carry out substantive changes during an election year. Trade
union representatives acknowledged that there was some need for improving labor market
flexibility, but cited the importance of wide-ranging consultation among all stakeholders.
23.
The authorities recognize that the benefits of labor market reforms are likely to
materialize only over the medium to long term. They expressed concern about the present
high unemployment rate and its large component of unskilled workers. While there is
evidence that the income of this group is being supported to a large extent by informal
household transfers, the authorities and staff agreed that additional measures, such as public
work programs and training, should be considered to ameliorate their situation.
24.
The mission encouraged the authorities to promote further private sector
participation in the economy, including foreign direct investment. Private sector
development could be enhanced by reducing state involvement in commercial activities, such
as electricity, and the importation of petroleum products, rice, and cement. The authorities
were of the view that the small size of the domestic market and relatively high labor costs
constrained FDI flows. The mission welcomed the draft bill designed to facilitate publicprivate sector partnerships in infrastructure investments. This initiative will enhance
prospects for domestic and foreign direct investments and will relieve the burden on the
budget to finance large investment projects.
C. Fiscal Policy
25.
The fiscal policy discussions focused on addressing persistent deficits and their
impact on medium-term debt sustainability. Without significant policy reform, the fiscal
deficit for 2004/05 is expected to rise to about 6½ percent of GDP. If the fiscal deficit
remains at this level over the medium term, public sector debt could rise to over 76 percent of
GDP by 2007/08. 9 The mission proposed a medium-term path to reduce gradually the deficit
9

In this case, public finances would become significantly vulnerable, and the debt could
exceed 100 percent of GDP by 2007/08 under a combination of plausible negative shocks.

- 19 -

to 2 percent of GDP by 2007/08, which would allow the public debt to fall to about 64
percent of GDP by the end of the period. Sensitivity analysis shows that when deficits are
reduced, public sector debt would also be resilient to external shocks and would quickly
return to a stable level, even in the event of a combination of temporary interest rate and
output shocks. Consistent with the proposed medium-term path, the mission proposed that
the authorities reduce the fiscal deficit to 4.7 percent of GDP in 2004/05.
26.
On the revenue side, the mission suggested a number of measures for 2004/05.
These included: (a) broadening the income tax base; and (b) applying the VAT to some items
that are currently exempted or zero rated. The mission reiterated the need to include a
number of fringe benefits in taxable income, subject interest and dividend income to a
withholding tax, and reduce the generous allowance for capital investment. Staff also
recommended broadening the base of the VAT to cover electricity and processed and nonraw
foods. These reforms, together with some other nontax measures, could yield some 0.7
percent of GDP in 2004/05.
27.
Regarding expenditure, the mission highlighted the need to prioritize spending,
and to review the effectiveness and coverage of the current generalized subsidies on rice
and flour. In addition, the mission suggested: (i) further trimming of the capital budget and
phasing some projects over the next several years; and (ii) lengthening the maturity structure
of the domestic debt (Box 4). Regarding the latter, the staff urged the government to create a
debt management unit. The proposed lower primary deficit would reduce the borrowing
requirement of the budget and lower interest payments. A restructuring of domestic debts
would also significantly reduce interest costs for the following reasons. First, the fall in the
level of the yield curve means that the interest cost of lengthening the maturity of previously
accumulated debt—especially given the large issuance of 2-year bonds in 2002/03—will lead
to substantial savings. Second, a further moderation of inflationary expectations, and more
subdued long term growth, should be accompanied by a further fall and flattening of the yield
curve over the coming years, leading to interest savings on newly accumulated debt. Overall,
the proposed expenditure measures could save 1.1 percent of GDP.
28.
The authorities were in general agreement with the proposed fiscal measures,
but they acknowledged that there would be political resistance to some of them. They
welcomed the revenue proposals and indicated that they were also considering to set up an
independent Revenue Authority in line with recent recommendations from an FAD technical
assistance mission. As to expenditure policy, the authorities indicated that they were
receiving support from the World Bank and the U.S. Treasury to develop a Medium-Term
Expenditure Framework. While they agreed in principle to the targeting of subsidies, they
noted that reducing these subsides may be difficult in light of the upcoming election.
Moreover, the authorities were of the view that putting in place an efficient system of direct
transfers would take time and be administratively challenging. They also indicated that they
were planning to postpone some capital projects that would save about MUR 500 million
(0.3 percent of GDP) in 2004/05. To mitigate the effect of a bunching of maturing treasury
bills in 2004/05, the authorities are in the process of implementing a strategy to restructure
the debt into longer maturities.

- 20 -

Box 4. Domestic Public Debt in Mauritius1
The increase in Mauritius’s
public debt can be attributed
primarily to: (i) fiscal
imbalances that emerged
since the late 1990s as the
government invested heavily
in education and
infrastructure for the new ICT
sector; and (ii) the issuance of
treasury bills for monetary
policy purposes. The BOM
only began issuing central
bank bills as a monetary
policy tool in July 2003.

However, unless the fiscal deficit is significantly reduced, lengthening the maturity structure
would only postpone the debt problem.

29.
To reduce contingent liabilities, the mission stressed the need to address the
difficult financial condition of the STC and the CEB. The authorities indicated that the
recently implemented automatic pricing mechanism for petroleum products will prevent the
STC from accumulating further losses. Prices will be adjusted on a quarterly basis in
response to changes in the international price of oil. The initial adjustments on April 2, 2004,
which resulted in an increase in diesel prices, are unlikely to cause a significant rise in bus
fares.
30.
The CEB has been able to reduce its overdraft in the banking system from
MUR 1 billion (around one percent of domestic credit) in September 2000 to MUR 300
million (about ¼ of a percent of domestic credit). However, this situation is expected to be
reversed as the CEB incurs expenditure related to its transmission and distribution networks
during the rest of 2004. Additionally, the CEB has significant debts with the government that
it has not been servicing and faces unfunded pension liabilities. The authorities recognize the
difficult financial position of the CEB and have been implementing a strategy to corporatize
its operations, including through the setting-up of a new governance structure, the possible
sale of part of the government’s shares, and the establishment of a utilities’ regulator. The
authorities, however, remain noncommittal at this stage regarding an immediate adjustment
in electricity tariffs.
D. Monetary and Financial Sector Policies
31.
As mentioned above, the authorities have been pursuing an informal inflation
targeting framework, and the BOM has established credibility in achieving its inflation
objectives. The monetary programs adopted by the central bank have generally been
successful, and over the last seven to eight years the BOM has exceeded its publicly
announced inflation target only once, and by a small margin. In addition to primary sales of
treasury bills/BOM bills, the BOM has used the Lombard rate to signal the direction of
monetary policy. However, transactions at the Lombard facility have become infrequent and
the Lombard rate has increasingly become disconnected from other interest rates. The
mission suggested that the BOM adopt short-term interest rates as its operational target,
mainly through the development of an active secondary market in government securities and
BOM bills. This would provide a more direct link, through the yield curve, to banks’ lending
behavior and the credit markets. It would also transparently indicate the intended direction of
monetary policy and support the development of a more formal inflation targeting
framework. The authorities responded that they were reviewing their monetary policy
framework; they agreed that there was a need to target interest rates at the shorter end of the
market.
32.
The BOM agreed that the current situation of excess liquidity in the banking
system largely reflects the drawdown of government deposits, weak credit demand, and
the cautious attitude of banks toward credit risk. The mission argued that this excess
liquidity could be a potential source of rapid money growth and inflationary pressures if
credit growth was to pick up. The BOM agreed with this view and indicated that it had been
attempting to absorb the excess liquidity through the issuance of BOM bills. However, given

- 22 -

the weak prospects for some key sectors of the economy, the BOM believes that it is unlikely
that credit growth will accelerate quickly and that the risk of an increase in inflation remains
low.
33.
Monetary policy faces the additional challenge of rising oil and other commodity
prices and the impact that such imported inflation could have on the domestic price
level. To date, this impact has been partly mitigated by the nominal strengthening of the
rupee against the U.S. dollar. Looking forward, the authorities have indicated that their main
focus is to prevent a rise in the core inflation rate by keeping inflationary expectations low.
34.
The financial system in Mauritius is generally sound, but there is a need to
mitigate and diversify the onshore banking sector’s credit risk concentration. Several
steps have been taken to enforce limits on large exposures and related-party transactions, to
subject deposit-taking nonbanks to BOM regulation and supervision, and to develop a
comprehensive credit information bureau.10 The authorities were urged to pass the draft laws
to revise the Bank of Mauritius Act—which would strengthen the independence of the
central bank—and the Banking Act—to improve supervision and regulation—by the time of
the announcement of the 2004/05 budget. The guidance notes on AML/CFT that have been
issued are in line with recommendations of the FSSA and cover the strengthening of banks’
internal controls, customer identification procedures, and record keeping, and the identification and reporting of suspicious transactions. In addition, the authorities passed the
Convention of the Suppression of the Financing of Terrorism Act 2003.
35.
Development of an efficient corporate bond market would be an important
alternative for institutional investors and would contribute to the overall stability of the
banking sector. It would provide well-developed pension funds and insurance companies the
option of investing in long-term Mauritian assets while spreading credit concentration in the
banking sector. To encourage market development, the mission stressed that the tax rate on
interest earned on corporate bonds should be harmonized with the rates on other financial
instruments. The full development of this market, however, would need to be preceded by an
active trading of government debts. In this regard, the mission welcomed the recent listing of
government treasury bills on the Mauritian Stock Exchange.

10

The authorities also took steps to contain the potential damage to the financial system from
the fraud case involving around US$31 million at the Mauritius Commercial Bank (MCB) in
February 2003. In March 2003, the BOM enlisted the services of an investigative firm and a
team from the central bank supported the investigations. A report by the consultants recommended a strengthening of the internal controls of MCB, the review of the concentration of
powers vested in its staff, and periodic reviews of the work of key staff members. The MCB
is already implementing many of the recommendations.

- 23 -

E. Exchange Rate and External Sector Policies
36.
The authorities agreed with the mission that the current managed float regime
has served the country well. The exchange rate does not appear to be misaligned, and the
real effective exchange rate has remained relatively stable in the last two years. The mission
commended the authorities’ decision to limit intervention in the foreign exchange market to
smoothing volatility in the exchange rate. BOM purchases in the foreign exchange market
declined in 2003 and during the first three months of 2004 there was no intervention in the
market. More generally, the mission supports the authorities’ view that for Mauritius to
remain competitive, the best course of action is to achieve real productivity gains, rather than
rely on a depreciating exchange rate.
37.
The recovery in the tourism sector is expected to contribute to sustaining a
current account surplus of 2½ percent of GDP in 2004/05. However, as a result of the
expected decline in textile exports from the EPZ and a possible slowdown in sugar exports,
the current account is expected to weaken over the medium term.
38.
The external debt has been on a declining trend and remains sustainable in the
medium term, even when subject to plausible shocks. The external debt is estimated to
have declined from 25½ percent of GDP in 1999/00 to 19 percent in 2003/04. Stress tests
indicate that even with combined negative shocks to the non-interest current account, real
GDP growth, and the GDP deflator in 2004/05 and 2005/06, the external debt would rise to
31¾ percent of GDP in 2005/06 but would fall to 27½ percent in 2007/08.
39.
Mauritius has no significant nontariff barriers, except with regard to state
trading and monopoly imports of petroleum products. The maximum tariff rate is 80 percent (applicable to more than 10 percent of the total number of imported products), and the
unweighted average nominal tariff rate is 18.5 percent. No major changes to the trade system
have occurred since last year and the trade restrictiveness index is 6 on a 10-point scale,
indicating a moderately open economy. The mission recommended a reduction in the number
of nonzero tariff bands from eight to three, and urged the adoption of a preannounced
medium-term tariff reform, which should include a lowering of the maximum and average
tariff rates.
40.
The mission encouraged the government to liberalize further its trade policies
within COMESA and SADC agreements. While COMESA is planning to introduce a
customs union by end-2004, conflicting areas will emerge concerning countries with dual
membership in COMESA and SADC. Thus, the mission urged the authorities to coordinate
their trade policies with the two institutions to avoid possible conflicts.
IV. STAFF APPRAISAL
41.
Mauritius’s main strength continues to be its public institutions. Strong governance, rule of law, a stable democratic system, and a predictable regulatory environment
have served to promote investment and confidence in the economy. These characteristics

- 24 -

should support the needed structural transformation of the economy in the face of an
increasingly competitive global environment.
42.
Growth in the past has been driven mainly by the high rate of domestic savings,
with little reliance on external sources of financing. The growth process has also been
defined by capital deepening rather than increases in productivity. The staff believes that,
going forward, the elimination of trade preferences will imply that foreign direct investment
and improvements in productivity will be critical to achieving high rates of growth.
43.
The impending loss of trade preferences in sugar and textiles poses significant
medium-term downside risks and heightens the need for rapid adjustment to the
changing global environment. While some subsectors in the textile industry are likely to
grow—where Mauritian firms remain competitive—other subsectors could suffer significant
output and employment losses. Against this background, the country faces the challenge of
significantly reducing costs and improving competitiveness.
44.
The authorities are fully cognizant of these challenges and are taking appropriate steps to strengthen Mauritius’s key sectors. In this regard, it would be important to
review the initial phase of the Sugar Sector Strategy in order to determine whether production costs have been reduced sufficiently to improve long-term viability, and to adopt any
additional actions that might be warranted. The establishment of TEST to support the rehabilitation of viable textile enterprises is timely, and the proposed restructuring of corporate
debts should provide firms the breathing space necessary to carry out the required reforms.
45.
One of the fundamental reasons for the decline in competitiveness in the textile
sector is the persistent rise in unit labor costs. For the restructuring of the sector to succeed, the current centralized wage setting system must be replaced by a system based on
collective bargaining at the firm level. This would help ensure that there is a closer link
between wage increases and productivity growth. In addition, the numerous regulations
governing the conditions of employment in various sectors, which limit the ability of firms to
redeploy and create jobs for low-skilled workers, should be promptly streamlined.
46.
The authorities should be commended for their efforts to diversify the economy.
Although the ICT sector is expected to grow more slowly than previously envisaged, the
authorities rightfully see it not just as a pillar of medium-term growth but also as a platform
that could transform the overall economy. While recognizing the importance of the leading
role of the government in providing the necessary infrastructure for the sector, it will be
critical to ensure that the risks are appropriately balanced between the public and private
sectors. Additional efforts by the government to support growth in financial services, free
port activities and tourism are also praiseworthy. However, greater opportunities for private
sector participation should be provided for in the utilities, transportation, and commercial
sectors. In this regard, the initiation of a public-private sector partnership framework is
welcome.

- 25 -

47.
Mauritius faces the challenge of achieving medium-term fiscal sustainability.
Addressing this challenge requires a strong commitment on the part of the authorities, particularly in the run up to the election. Given the downside risks facing the economy, it is
important not to postpone the difficult decisions that have to be made on the budget. Slower
economic growth combined with a sudden rise in real interest rates could very quickly lead to
unsustainable debt dynamics unless the fiscal deficit is brought down in the next several
years. In particular, there is scope for broadening the tax base and prioritizing and rephasing
capital expenditures. The adjustment path to fiscal sustainability is gradual, which would
ensure that fiscal policy does not become unduly contractionary in the face of a possible
slowdown in economic activity.
48.
The credibility achieved by the BOM in reducing inflation is praiseworthy,
especially in light of the relatively large budget deficits. Looking ahead, efforts are required to absorb the high levels of excess liquidity in the banking system, which poses the
risk that inflationary pressures may reemerge. In addition, the monetary policy framework, in
particular the use of the Lombard rate as a signaling rate, should be reviewed with a view to
moving gradually toward targeting short-term interest rates, which would provide a more
direct link to banks’ lending behavior and credit markets.
49.
The mission welcomes the BOM’s policy of allowing the exchange rate to be
mainly market determined. Despite the appreciation of the rupee against the U.S. dollar,
the current level of the real effective exchange rate appears to be broadly appropriate. The
staff agrees with the authorities on the need to foster external competitiveness through real
productivity gains.
50.
Staff welcomes the many steps that have been taken to strengthen the financial
system. The authorities have responded positively to the recommendations of the FSAP
carried out in 2003. Other actions should be considered to address potential vulnerabilities in
the sector, such as encouraging greater participation by foreign banks in the domestic market.
Further, development of an efficient corporate bond market would present an important
alternative to bank financing and would contribute to the overall stability and soundness of
the financial system by allowing institutional investors to diversify their portfolio and
contributing to a reduction of credit concentration in the banking sector.
51.
Staff recommends that the number of tariff bands be reduced, and that a
preannounced medium-term tariff reform be adopted. This should include a lowering of
the maximum and average tariff rates. Moreover, trade policies within COMESA and SADC
should be coordinated to avoid conflicts.
52.
It is proposed that the next Article IV consultation with Mauritius be held on the
standard 12-month cycle.

denominated debt; and ε = nominal exchange rate depreciation (measured by increase in local currency value of U.S. dollar).
3/ The real interest rate contribution is derived from the denominator in footnote 2/ as r - π (1+g) and the real growth contribution as -g.
4/ The exchange rate contribution is derived from the numerator in footnote 2/ as αε(1+r).
5/ For the projected period, the figures inlcude the contribution from exchange rate depreciation
6/ Defined as public sector deficit, plus amortization of medium and long-term public sector debt, plus short-term debt at end of previous period.

APPENDIX I

Mauritius: Public and External Debt Sustainability
This analysis shows that under the baseline projections (the reform scenario), the debt ratio
will decline and fiscal sustainability (indicated by falling or stable debt ratios) is achieved in
the medium term. In this case, the debt ratios are robust enough to withstand a series of
plausible shocks. However, a combination of large shocks could lead to an increase in the
debt/GDP ratio, which could become unsustainable if the authorities fail to reduce the fiscal
deficit over the medium term. External debt has been on a declining trend and remains
sustainable in the medium term, even when subject to plausible shocks.
1.
Under the staff’s baseline projections where the overall deficit is reduced to
2 percent of GDP by 2007/08, Mauritius’ public sector debt ratio declines over the
medium term (Table 8a). The debt ratio is projected to decline from about 73 percent to
64 percent of GDP.
2.
The public sector debt remains largely sustainable under the standard sensitivity
tests. Under the first sensitivity test, which sets real GDP growth, the primary deficit, and
real interest rates at historical averages,1 the debt/GDP ratio declines to about 68 percent by
2007/08. Under several other sets of sensitivity tests, which assume independent temporary
shocks to key parameters, Mauritius’s public sector debt declines over the medium term,
albeit at slower rates.
•
A temporary rise in the real interest rate by itself would not derail public debt
dynamics significantly, and the debt/GDP ratio would broadly follow the same path as in the
baseline scenario.
•
Under both the real GDP shock and the primary deficit shock, the public debt would
rise temporarily to about 78 percent, and then decline to 70-71 percent of GDP by 2007/08.
•
The combination of large shocks could possibly lead to a significant rise in public
debt. Unlikely shocks of two standard deviations in real interest rates and primary balance,
and three standard deviations in real growth would cause public debt to jump to 87 percent of
GDP, but this would decline subsequently, albeit remaining at around 76 percent by the end
of the period.
•
In the absence of fiscal adjustment over the medium term, debt dynamics would
become unsustainable (Table 8b). In the no fiscal adjustment scenario, the fiscal deficit
would rise to 6.5 percent of GDP in 2004/05 and remain at that level during the period. This
would be associated with unfavorable debt dynamics, as the debt ratio would increase to
about 76½ percent of GDP, and become increasingly vulnerable to various shocks.
______________

1

The historical averages of the past ten years for real GDP growth and primary deficits are 4.9 and
1.3 percent of GDP, respectively, and 1.2 percent for the real interest rate over the past 7 years.

- 38 -

APPENDIX I

3.
External debt has been on a decreasing trend since 1997/98 and is expected to
remain subdued in the medium term. The external debt/GDP ratio declined from 31.5
percent in 1997/98 to 19.3 percent in 2002/03. In the baseline scenario, the external
debt/GDP ratio is expected to decline further to 12.4 percent in 2007/08. Gross external
financing needs will remain negative mainly due to the positive non-interest current account.
4.
The most important factor affecting the external debt/GDP ratio is the noninterest current account. The external debt/GDP ratio could rise to 31.3 percent in 2005/06
and then decline to 27.9 percent in 2007/08 in the most extreme scenario where the noninterest current account is at the historical average minus two standard deviations in 2004/05
and in 2005/06. Figure 8 shows that in this case, the gross external financing needs would
increase dramatically in 2004/05 and in 2005/06 before falling back to near balance in the
following years. When several shocks are combined (one standard deviation decrease from
historical average of GDP growth, GDP deflator, and non-interest current account) in
2004/05 and 2005/06, the external debt/GDP ratio could rise to 31.7 percent in 2005/06 and
then decline to 27.6 percent in 2007/08, leading to positive gross external financing needs.

APPENDIX III

Mauritius: Relations with the World Bank Group
(As of April 2004)
The Bank Group strategy and lending operations
1.
Mauritius has been a member of the World Bank since its independence in 1968.
Mauritius is a development success story. In 1968, the country was poor, with a nominal per
capita income of about US$260. Today, nominal income per capita is US$4,020 (Atlas
method). The country graduated from IDA, the part of the World Bank Group that provides
credits and grants to the poorest of the developing countries, in FY1975, and the last IDA
credit was made in July 1974. In the 1980s, the World Bank supported macroeconomic and
sectoral policy reforms through quick-disbursing loans. After the success of the structural
adjustment effort, the country turned to more traditional project lending.
2.
Given Mauritius’s strong track record in economic management, the World Bank
approved a Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) on May 7, 2002, which shifts from traditional
project support to analytical and advisory services coupled with program support. The CAS
supports the government’s five-year Economic Agenda for the New Millennium (NEA), with
advice and direct budget assistance, around the three objectives of: (i) increasing Mauritius’s
competitiveness; (ii) bringing about deeper social development and social cohesion; and (iii)
preserving and protecting Mauritius’s fragile environment.
3.
To better meet the needs of the government, the World Bank approved a Public
Expenditure Reform Loan (US$40 million) in 2002 to support the government's Economic
Agenda through its first budget. The PERL was disbursed fully on June 25, 2002, and closed
on September 30, 2003. The PERL directly supported the government’s reform agenda,
based on actions taken through 2001/02. Specifically, it supported education reform, poverty
reduction, and expenditure allocations on the island of Rodrigues, environment and transport
reforms, and economic management.
3.
Under the CAS, analytical and advisory services are provided in a variety of forms,
ranging from just-in-time advice to formal reports. The Bank recently carried out a Country
Procurement Assessment Review, a Public Expenditure Review to assess the sustainability of
the NEA, and a Transport Action Plan. Under the previous CAS, the Bank prepared a report
on modernization of the pension system. It is also supporting work on budgetary
management and will be undertaking an Investment Climate Assessment.
4.
The World Bank currently has two active projects totaling US$14 million in the
financial services and environment sewage and sanitation sectors, of which US$5.9 million
was disbursed as of April 2004.
5.
In 2003, the International Finance Corporation (IFC), the Bank Group’s private sector
lending arm, began an advisory mandate for structuring private participation in the Water and

- 46 -

APPENDIX III

Sewer utility. IFC's main focus for future activity is to support the deepening of the financial
market, undertake advisory work, and make investments in private infrastructure. IFC has
committed no new investments since 1996; the portfolio has steadily decreased as
investments have been repaid and/or exited. IFC is seeking projects with Mauritian sponsors
investing elsewhere in Africa.
6.
Mauritian investors have benefited substantially in recent years from guarantees from
the Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency (MIGA) for their investments in continental
Africa, with total gross exposure currently at US$116.3 million, and net exposure at
US$105.3 million, for projects in Burundi, Mozambique, and Nigeria. MIGA currently has
active interest from Mauritian investors for projects in Afghanistan, Madagascar, and
Tanzania. Total coverage for these projects in the power and oil and gas sectors, is expected
to be about $150 million. In FY03, MIGA provided $911,000 in guarantees for Mauritius
Telecom, covering its investment in Burundi against the risks of war and civil disturbance,
transfer restriction, and expropriation. MIGA also maintains on-line investment promotion
services, which feature investment opportunities and the related legal and regulatory
environment in Mauritius.
7.
Mauritians have participated in World Bank Institute regional activities that were held
elsewhere or by video-conference. A program on Strengthening Parliament in FY02 drew 12
participants. Responding to a Mauritian Government request in June 2003, the Bank has been
discussing the possibility of developing a customized knowledge sharing program
coordinated by WBI on issues related to Information and Communication Technology and
competitiveness.

macroeconomic policy. Cooperation is also taking place on financial sector reforms and trade
and labor market issues (the World Bank completed a Trade Mauritius Membership in SADC
Note in FY04 and will undertake a labor market review).
Areas in which the World Bank leads
9.
Areas in which the World Bank takes the lead are related to specific sector advice in
the areas such as the environment, sewage and sanitation, education and training, social
welfare, pensions, transport sector, MTEF, health, insurance, procurement, restructuring the
EPZ sector, and privatization, as well as through a number of analytical studies as described
above, including an ongoing Investment Climate Assessment.
Areas in which the IMF leads
10.
Areas where the Fund takes the lead role relate to policy advice and reforms with
respect to (i) overall economic policy advice and targets for macroeconomic targets; (ii) tax
policy and administration; (iii) budgetary accounting; (iv) treasury procedures; (v) public
sector wage policy; and (vi) monetary management and exchange rate policy. The Bank team
actively participates in discussions between the Fund and the government in these areas,
however, especially with respect to the setting of overall macroeconomic targets.

APPENDIX IV

Mauritius: Statistical Issues
The quality and timeliness of Mauritius’s reporting of core minimum data, as well as of other
economic and financial statistics to the IMF are, in general, satisfactory. Efforts are under
way to improve the frequency and quality of fiscal data, particularly regarding their
consistency with monetary sector data. The authorities already publish economic data on
Mauritius, including a Monthly Bulletin published by the Bank of Mauritius and a number of
statistics reports published by the Central Statistics Office (CSO), which are accessible via
the Internet. Mauritius started participating in the IMF’s General Data Dissemination System
(GDDS) in September 2000. The authorities have shown interest in subscribing to the Special
Data Dissemination Standard (SDDS), but improvements in the periodicity and timeliness of
several data series are required before subscription can take place.
Real sector
Mauritius’s annual national accounts are based on the concepts and definitions recommended
by the System of National Accounts 1993. National accounts data are prepared by the CSO on
a calendar-year basis and cover all transactions categories except financial transactions. In
general, GDP by the production approach is compiled by using the ratios of the 1997 Census
of Economic Activities (CEA). However, for enterprises not covered by the CEA
(agriculture, fishing and forestry) the technical ratios may have been presumed unchanged
for more than twenty years. Annual surveys rely on enterprise accounts that do not reflect
calendar years and underreport output. Most government operations and external transactions
other than goods are recorded on a cash basis rather than on an accrual basis. GDP estimates
by expenditure are not derived independently, as household final consumption expenditure is
determined as a residual. Although the five-yearly Household Budget Survey generates an
independent estimate, this estimate is considerably lower than the one resulting from the
commodity flow approach. GDP volume change is published as real growth rates over the
previous year. Following IMF technical assistance in 1999 and 2000, the CSO started to
compile national accounts on a quarterly basis for past years. However, the CSO has not yet
compiled quarterly national accounts for the current year, and improvements are still needed
regarding the timeliness and quality of domestic production indicators and foreign trade
statistics.
The consumer price index is regularly rebased as consumption patterns and relative prices
change. As from July 2002, a new series of the consumer price index has been introduced
(July 2001-June 2002=100), with weights derived from the 2001/02 Household Budget
Survey that followed the COICOP to classify goods and services. Producer price indices of
agriculture and manufacturing, input costs of construction, wage rate, and employment have
been developed but are not reported to the IMF for publication in International Financial
Statistics (IFS).

APPENDIX IV

Government finance
Mauritius continues to be a regular and timely reporter of fiscal data for surveillance,
including quarterly data and annual projections. The July 2001 mission to prepare the data
Report on the Observance of Standards and Codes (ROSC) highlighted the need for
statistical improvements in the fiscal data, especially to reduce duplication in data collection,
publish quarterly central government data, and improve the timeliness of consolidated
government data. The data for surveillance purposes would be enhanced significantly if it
would contain information on the overall public accounts, in particular off-budget accounts
and nonfinancial public sector corporations. Follow-up technical assistance was provided in
January 2002 to assist the authorities with the compilation of nonfinancial public sector data.
The authorities also reported 2002 general government data for publication in the
Government Finance Statistics Yearbook (GFSY). While the authorities produce quarterly
GFS data, they do not report these for publication in IFS.
Monetary accounts
The authorities report money and banking statistics on a timely and regular basis. In March
2002, the IMF provided technical assistance to implement the Monetary and Financial
Statistics Manual (MFSM). The BOM successfully implemented the compilation procedures
for the new Depository Corporations Survey (DCS) as recommended in the MFSM and
compiled data in this framework for the period beginning in August 2001. However, the
monetary survey is still used for monetary policy purposes (in the Monetary Targeting
Framework) and for reporting to the Fund, There is no specific timeframe for switching to
the DCS and discontinuing the compilation of the monetary survey.
Balance of payments
Mauritius provides quarterly balance of payments and international investment position data
to the Statistics Department on the basis of the classification system of the Balance of
Payments Manual (5th edition). The data in the financial account of the balance of payments
and in the international investment position statement, particularly those on direct investment
and portfolio investment, have limited coverage. To address these gaps a 2001 data ROSC
mission recommended the establishment of a survey of enterprises, banks, and other financial
institutions, both onshore and offshore, to obtain data on claims on, and liabilities to,
nonresidents. Follow-up action by the authorities is due.

Statement by the IMF Staff Representative
July 21, 2004
This statement provides additional information that has become available since the issuance
of the staff report. The information does not alter the thrust of the staff appraisal.
1.
On June 11, 2004, the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Finance submitted to
the legislature the budget for 2004/05. The budget assumes real economic growth of 5½
percent for the fiscal year, largely on account of a more optimistic forecast for the financial
services, tourism and export processing zone sectors than contained in the staff report, and
inflation of 4 percent, which is in line with staff projections. The overall fiscal deficit is
budgeted at 5 percent of GDP, compared with 4.7 percent recommended by the staff. The
higher deficit is mainly due to larger capital outlays.
2.
The budget contains a tax package that includes part of the measures recommended in
the staff report, as well as other measures. The main difference with the measures proposed
by staff are in the income tax, where the staff report had assumed no significant changes. In
addition, the authorities did not implement the proposed measures to reduce VAT
exemptions and the list of zero-rated commodities. The yield from the package is nonetheless
expected to be about 1 percent of GDP, slightly higher than that arising from the proposals
discussed in the staff report, mainly owing to reforms in corporate taxes and increases in
some excises. The package proposes broad income tax reforms, including a redistribution of
the tax burden from low to high income earners and an increase in the contribution of the
corporate sector, thus broadening the tax base. Specifically, the number of brackets for the
personal income tax will be increased from two to four, with the rate on the highest bracket
being raised from 25 to 30 percent and that on the lowest bracket being lowered from 15 to
10 percent. The special allowances for investment to encourage firms to modernize their
plants have been reduced, and an Alternative Minimum Tax will be imposed on corporations
that distribute dividends. Moreover, the threshold requiring professionals and the selfemployed to register with the tax department and submit returns has been lowered. The
budget also proposes higher excise duties, a reduction of customs duties on selected items, a
higher ceiling for the allowance on interest income, a new tax on tourism (to take the form of
an arrivals fee incorporated in the airline ticket), and improvements in tax administration.
3.
The government also announced its intention to improve the debt maturity profile. To
do this, the Loans Act has been amended to allow for the issuance of a wider range of longterm debt instruments.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
August 25, 2004

International Monetary Fund
700 19th Street, NW
Washington, D. C. 20431 USA

Concludes 2004 cle IV Consultation with auritius
IMF Concludes 2004 Article IV Consultation with Mauritius
On July 21, 2004, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded the
Article IV consultation with Mauritius.1
Background
Real GDP growth is expected to rebound to around 4½ percent in 2003/04, following a
disappointing 2¾ percent in 2002/03 (July-June). This largely reflects the recovery of tourism
and sugar production, the latter due to favorable weather, and continued strong construction
and transportation activity. However, high domestic production costs and increasing
competition have continued to affect adversely the Export Processing Zone (EPZ) sector,
which registered negative growth for the second consecutive year. The unemployment rate
rose to 10.2 percent in 2003 from 9.7 percent in 2002.
The overall fiscal deficit in 2003/04 is estimated to be in line with the target of 5.5 percent of
GDP, a reduction from 6.2 percent in 2002/03. This improvement reflects primarily higher tax
and nontax revenue. The estimated overall balance of 30 nonfinancial public sector
corporations shifted to a surplus of 0.9 percent in 2002/03 from a deficit of 0.6 percent of GDP
in 2001/02. The Central Electricity Board (CEB) continues to face financial difficulties.
The financial position of the State Trading Corporation (STC) is expected to improve following
1

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies.
On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the
Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the
Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the
country's authorities. This PIN summarizes the views of the Executive Board as expressed during
the July 21, 2004 Executive Board discussion based on the staff report.

-2the introduction in early April 2004 of an automatic mechanism for adjusting the prices of
petroleum products.
There is a danger that public debt could become unsustainable as a result of continuing
central government fiscal deficits. The public debt, which was around 66 percent of GDP in
1999/00, rose to about 80 percent in 2002/03, and is projected at 73 percent of GDP by
end-June 2004.
The Bank of Mauritius (BOM) has established credibility in achieving its inflation objective.
Average annual inflation fell to around 4 percent in 2003, from 6.4 percent in 2002, reflecting in
part slower growth in credit to the private sector. The outlook is for a further moderate fall in
inflation over the near term, as demand pressures remain subdued. Given lower inflation
expectations, the BOM lowered its Lombard rate in five steps by a total of 200 basis points, to
9½ percent in late January 2004. However, given the weaknesses in key sectors of the
economy, banks have been cautious in advancing credit, which has led to a situation of excess
liquidity in the banking system. The financial system in Mauritius is generally sound.
The government has also taken a number of actions to strengthen its Anti-Money Laundering
and Combating the Financing of Terrorism (AML/CFT) framework.
The overall balance of payments surplus is projected to decline from 6½ percent of GDP in
2002/03 to below 2 percent in 2003/04. The current account is projected to remain in surplus
with the recovery of the tourism sector offsetting a widening in the trade deficit. The capital and
financial account is projected to register a small deficit of 0.8 percent of GDP in 2003/04
compared with a surplus in 2002/03. FDI flows are expected to weaken in 2003/04, however,
portfolio investment inflows (primarily from U.S. and U.K. mutual funds) should register strong
growth as a result of high interest rate differentials.
Executive Board Assessment
Directors noted Mauritius’ impressive social and economic achievements during the last
twenty-five years, in particular the strong GDP growth, high level of domestic savings, and
improving living standards. These achievements have been underpinned by the strength of
public institutions, good governance, respect for the rule of law, a stable democratic system,
and a transparent regulatory environment—elements that will continue to serve the country
well as it confronts future economic challenges. Nevertheless, Directors expressed concern
about the high and growing level of unemployment, especially among the unskilled, the
uncertain medium-term outlook for a number of key economic sectors, and the large stock of
domestic public debt.
Directors considered that, to safeguard Mauritius’s past achievements, prepare for a more
competitive global environment, and strengthen medium-term fiscal sustainability, the
authorities should focus in the period ahead on implementing structural adjustments and
reforms, especially in the sugar and textile sectors and the labor market, and on reducing
persistent budget deficits. It would be important to press ahead in these areas while the
economy is still performing well, and the public debt is manageable.

-3Directors welcomed the reduction in the fiscal deficit achieved during 2003/04 and the fiscal
efforts announced in the 2004/05 Budget Speech. At the same time, they urged the authorities
to take further measures to reduce the deficit, with a view to returning the domestic public debt
to a sustainable path and stabilizing the debt-to-GDP ratio over the medium term.
They recommended, on the revenue side, a broadening of the income tax base and the
extension of the VAT to additional items. On the spending side, they saw scope for more
carefully prioritizing government expenditures, stretching out non-critical capital projects, and
targeting the now-generalized subsidies for rice and flour to only the disadvantaged groups.
The need to maintain fiscal discipline in the period leading to the general elections was
underscored. Given the importance of improving the maturity structure of the debt, Directors
considered that the creation of a debt management unit in the Ministry of Finance would be a
step in the right direction.
Directors commended the authorities for their success in reducing inflation. Looking ahead,
they urged the central bank to monitor closely the excess liquidity in the banking system to
guard against a rapid expansion of credit to the private sector and increased inflation.
Directors encouraged the Bank of Mauritius to review the effectiveness of its monetary policy
instruments, in particular the signaling role of the Lombard rate. Directors noted that the
current level of the real effective exchange rate appears to be broadly in line with
macroeconomic fundamentals. They welcomed the central bank’s policy of allowing the
exchange rate to respond to market forces, and supported the central bank’s view that external
competitiveness should be fostered through real productivity gains.
Directors considered that the Mauritian financial system is well developed, sound, and
profitable. They welcomed the authorities’ positive response to the recommendations of the
Financial Sector Assessment Program carried out in 2003. Directors noted that the
development of an efficient corporate bond market would allow institutional investors to
diversify their portfolios and help reduce credit concentration, and could strengthen the overall
stability and soundness of the financial system. Directors welcomed the issuance of guidance
notes to banks on anti-money laundering and countering the financing of terrorism, and the
passage of the Convention on the Suppression of the Financing of Terrorism Act 2003.
Looking beyond the macroeconomic policy challenges to structural adjustments, Directors
were encouraged by the steps being taken by the government to address the impending loss
of trade preferences in the sugar and textile sectors, which risks a contraction of these sectors.
They welcomed the planned review of the Sugar Sector Strategy, and urged the authorities to
take further actions to strengthen the sector’s competitiveness. Directors also welcomed the
establishment of the Textile Emergency Support Team to assist in the rehabilitation and
restructuring of those textile enterprises judged to be viable.
Directors called for a closer link between wage increases and productivity growth to facilitate
the restructuring of the textile sector, stimulate job creation, and improve competitiveness.
In particular, they urged the authorities to take steps to make the wage bargaining system
more flexible and streamline labor regulations to stem the rise in unit labor costs. Directors
welcomed the comprehensive measures that have been taken to improve access to the

-4education system and strengthen the curriculum at all levels, which will help to alleviate the
skills mismatch in the economy and raise employment over the medium term.
Directors commended the authorities for their efforts to diversify the economy and create new
job opportunities by developing the financial services, tourism, and information and
communications technology sectors. While the government must continue to play a leading
role in providing infrastructure to support economic growth, Directors considered that greater
opportunities could be provided for private sector participation in infrastructure development, in
particular in the public utilities, transportation, and commercial areas. In this connection, they
welcomed efforts to facilitate public-private sector partnerships in infrastructure investments,
and also urged the authorities to take due note of the potential costs and risks of such
arrangements.
Directors welcomed the authorities’ commitment to trade liberalization and supported the
reduction of custom duties in the 2004/05 budget. At the same time, they urged the authorities
to announce a medium-term tariff reform program, including a lowering of the maximum and
average tariff rates.

1.
I would like to express the appreciation of my Mauritian authorities to the staff for the
constructive and comprehensive discussions they had during the 2004 Article IV
consultation. My authorities are in broad agreement with the staff’s analysis as well as with
their assessment regarding the main challenges facing the economy. In addressing these
challenges, my authorities have benefited well from the staff’s advice as well as from
excellent and timely technical assistance from the Fund, for which they are thankful. As the
Staff Report and the excellent Selected Issues Paper indicate, the Mauritian authorities in
close cooperation with the private sector have already started implementing wide ranging
reforms to adapt the country to the new environment. These reforms are bearing fruits, but
will require sustained efforts over the long term. My Mauritian authorities are committed to
implement the necessary reforms to ensure that the economy maintains a strong and
sustainable growth path, over the medium to long term.

Recent Developments
2.
The Mauritian economy rebounded in 2003/04, with real GDP growth estimated at
4.5 percent, following growth of about 2.7 percent in 2002/03. Per capita GDP is now
estimated at about US $4,000. This improved performance results from the recovery in the
sugar and tourism sectors, as well as stronger activity in the construction and transportation
sectors. However, the Export Processing Zone (EPZ), which consists mainly of textile and
garments industries and which has been the locomotive of the economy for several decades,
has experienced its second consecutive year of negative growth, reflecting higher production
costs and increased competition.
3.
In the fiscal sector, the deficit for 2003/04 is expected to be 5.6 percent of GDP
compared to 6.2 percent in 2002/03. The lack of a more pronounced improvement in the
deficit ratio is explained by shortfall in government revenue, and lower than projected
growth. The overall balance of the nonfinancial public enterprises turned into a surplus, but
the domestic public debt increased.
4.
Monetary policy remained prudent, with the central bank pursuing successfully its
informal inflation targeting framework. Inflation remained low and under control and fell to
below 4 percent in 2003/04. The lower inflationary expectations as well as lower demand for
private sector credit enabled a further decline in domestic interest rates. The Mauritian rupee
strengthened against the U.S. dollar, and helped to mitigate somewhat the rising oil and
commodity prices, and their impact on domestic inflation.
5.
The external current account remained in surplus, and the level of international
reserves remained comfortable and represents an import cover of about 8 months. The gross
domestic savings and investment rates have remained high at about 25 and 23 percent of
GDP, respectively.

-26.
On the labor market, the economy created more than 14,000 jobs in 2003/04, but the
unemployment rate increased to 10.5 percent. The Mauritian stock market continued to
register important gains, increasing by over 35 percent, in the year ending June 2004.
Overall, the Mauritian economy performed well, with private sector confidence remaining
strong.

Policies for 2004/05 and Medium-Term Prospects and Policies
7.
Although the economy is faced with a number of challenges, the reforms underway
and the policies envisaged should help to maintain real GDP growth at about 4 percent per
annum. Inflation is expected to remain under control. The fiscal deficit is projected to
decline, with the external current account balance remaining in surplus.
8.

The authorities agree with the staff that the three immediate challenges are:
- reducing the fiscal deficit;
- adapting the economy to the impending loss of trade preferences in sugar and
textiles; and
- carrying out structural reforms, including lessening labor market rigidities.

The authorities are cognizant of the constraints that an increasing public debt will
have on policies, and intend to take steps to reduce it.
Fiscal Policy
9.
It is my Mauritian authorities’ intention to reduce the fiscal deficit gradually over the
medium term, and to reverse the trend in the debt-to-GDP ratio. The authorities agree with
the staff that this is required to ensure fiscal sustainability and macroeconomic stability. For
2004/05, the deficit is projected at 5 percent of GDP, on the basis of additional revenue and
expenditure measures, a prioritization of capital outlays, and the lengthening of the maturity
structure of the domestic debt. As I noted last year, the high level of capital expenditure has
been the main cause of the increase in the deficit. For 2004/05, the projected fiscal deficit
will be almost equivalent to the level of capital expenditure, so that borrowing for the most
part will be to finance capital expenditure and not to meet recurrent expenditure.
10.
Over the medium term, as the government completes its program of capital spending
in the area of education and information technology, which presently accounts for the largest
block of capital spending, total outlays should come down, and thus contribute to a lowering
of the deficit. Moreover, to strengthen budgetary management, the authorities are in the
process of creating a Revenue Authority in line with FAD recommendations. They are also
working closely with bilateral and multilateral partners to develop a Medium-Term
Expenditure Framework. The new system has already been implemented in the areas of
Education and Training. It will be gradually introduced in all ministries. The MTEF should
allow the government to be more focused on objectives it wants to achieve, on results and
performance. On the issue of reducing subsidies, the authorities agree with the staff that this
would contribute to lower government expenditure, but it is an issue that is politically very
sensitive, and will require continued consultation with all social partners. The authorities are

-3of the view that this is one of the issues that will require a broad consensus. Broadening the
tax base is another issue that is being considered, and the authorities have taken steps in this
direction in the present Budget. These include the increase in the number of income tax
brackets from two to four, changes in the corporate income tax, including the Alternative
Minimum Tax, and the registration of professionals and other self-employed persons,.
Monetary and Financial Policies
11.
The Bank of Mauritius (BOM) has been quite successful in the pursuit of its informal
inflation targeting framework. As a result inflation has been brought down significantly over
the past years, and has enabled a lowering of interest rates. However, as the Lombard rate,
which the Bank of Mauritius has been using to signal the direction of monetary policy, has
become less effective, it is planning to review its monetary framework, with a view to
adopting short term interest rates as its operational target. In this regard, it is considering
developing an active secondary market in government securities and Bank of Mauritius bills.
12.
On the issue of excess liquidity in the banking system, the central bank does not think
that, in the present circumstances, the excess liquidity poses any risk of a surge in inflation.
Nevertheless, it is following developments carefully, and is attempting to absorb it through
the issuance of BOM bills.
13.
The financial system of Mauritius remains sound. The few areas of weaknesses, in
particular in the offshore financial sector, that had been identified in last year’s FSAP report,
are being addressed. The authorities agree with the staff that the financial market should be
deepened with the development of an efficient corporate bond market which would
contribute to the stability and soundness of the financial system. However, as the excellent
study on “Developing a Corporate Bond Market in Mauritius” in the Selected Issues paper
makes it clear, the development of such a market requires a number of preconditions to
which the authorities are giving their attention.
Structural Reforms
14.
As mentioned in previous Board discussions on Mauritius, the authorities have put in
place a broad strategy to deal with the challenges facing the economy. Most of the measures
needed are of a structural nature and will require fundamental changes in the way that the
economy has operated up to now. My Mauritian authorities’ approach has been one of close
cooperation with the private sector, and broad consultation with stakeholders. This approach
has been helpful in developing the strategy and the broad consensus needed to implement the
deep-seated changes that are needed and that are not only economic, but involve social and
cultural changes as well.
15.
As regards the sugar sector, a strategy has been put in place to restructure the
industry and to improve its competitiveness, but these changes will require some time to be
effective. Already the measures taken have resulted in the closure of several mills and the
loss of almost 8,000 jobs in the sugar industry. The strategy also includes measures aimed at
diversifying sugar-related activities, such as the production of electricity from the byproducts of sugar, as well as the production of ethanol and rum. The Government will start

-4soon consultation with stakeholders on the Mid-Term Review of the Sugar Sector Strategic
Plan to assess the progress made, and to decide on what further steps or changes are needed.
16.
Steps are also being taken to encourage the development of the non-sugar
agricultural sector, through, among others the leasing of agricultural land to small planters,
and the improvement of the land irrigation system. Under the Non-Sugar Sector Strategic
Plan, farmers are being encouraged and assisted to produce high-value added products with
export potential. They are receiving assistance from the newly created National
Biotechnology Institute in deciding what to produce. At the same time a Certification Body
is being set up to help farmers meet the sanitary certification and standards required by
importers, especially in the Euro area.
17.
The authorities are also working closely with the textile and garments sector to help
in its restructuring through technical advice and development finance. Already this sector
has lost 10,000 jobs, and the relocation of many textile factories could cause the loss of an
additional 20,000 jobs. Working closely with the private sector, the Government has set up a
Textile Emergency Support Team (TEST) which is helping viable enterprises to restructure.
This is being done through the provision of corporate diagnosis services as well as financial
resources from the National Equity Fund and the Development Bank of Mauritius for
capitalization and modernization of the enterprises. Improving productivity in the sector is
an important objective of the restructuring process. Retraining of displaced workers is also
being undertaken.
18.
As regards the other sectors, the tourism sector remains buoyant, and the
construction of a number of new upper-scale hotels by the private sector is envisaged for the
next few years. Training facilities for workers in this industry is being expanded. In the
Information and Communications Technology (ICT) sector, the infrastructure has been
almost completed, and more than 50 companies, accounting for the creation of over 2,000
jobs have started operation. It is expected that over 4,000 new jobs will be created by the
end of the year. Although the outlook for this sector appears less favorable than a year ago,
the authorities remain confident that it will become an important pillar of the economy in the
next few years.
19.
In addition to the sectoral policies being implemented, as described above, the
authorities are also focusing their attention on the labor market and further private sector
development. On the labor market, the increase in the unemployment rate is due to several
factors which include the ongoing restructuring and contraction of the two major sectors of
sugar and textiles, the skills mismatch and the rigidities in the labor market.
20.
The contraction of the sugar and textiles sectors which have been major generators of
employment has been a strong factor in the high level of unemployment. It has not been easy
for workers who have been for most of their life employed in one industry to be trained and
to find employment in other sectors. Most of the time the new jobs do not exist.
Nevertheless, the government is helping with different programs of retraining. As regards the
mismatch of skills, the significant investment in education should help to address this issue
over the medium term. But for the more immediate future and in order to meet the needs of
the market, the authorities have launched a national program for training of 5,000 high school

-5graduates in skills related to the needs of the ICT sector. Attention is also being given to the
training of those who have not completed high school education and who are having the most
difficult time finding a job. Special training programs in a number of crafts and professions
are being provided. The program is starting with some 3,000 trainees this year.
21.
Investment is also being made in developing a culture of entrepreneurship in
Mauritius. This will include a program of support to entrepreneurs, as well as a Young
Entrepreneur Scheme to help up to 100 qualified young entrepreneurs each year to start new
business ventures.
22.
The authorities view the unemployment problem as one that will require time to
solve. They are confident that the measures they are taking will not only help to diversify the
economy and create new employment opportunities, but they are also ensuring that these new
sectors will be able to get the type of workers that they need, thus helping the economy to
grow. The authorities also agree with the staff that these measures need to be complemented
by a reform of the various labor market institutions. It is a process that will take time, but
discussions with the trade unions have already started on ways to reduce rigidities in the
market. The authorities view this cooperative approach as essential to maintain social peace,
and are confident that progress will be made in this area.
23.
In conclusion, I would like to say that my Mauritian authorities are fully cognizant of
the challenges the economy faces, and are taking steps to address them. They are confident
that their gradual approach and the strategies that they have put in place will help the country
to maintain a high and sustainable growth path over the medium to long term.
