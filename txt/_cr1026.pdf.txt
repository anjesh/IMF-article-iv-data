KENYA
Staff Report for the 2009 Article IV Consultation
Prepared by the African Department
(In consultation with other departments)
Approved by Saul Lizondo and Dominique Desruelle
December 7, 2009
Mission Date and Team: October 15–30, 2009. Messrs. Atingi Ego (head) and
Mlachila, and Ms. Masha (all AFR), and Ms. Nkusu (SPR). Mr. Rogers (Senior
Resident Representative) assisted the mission, while Ms Zephirin (MCM) joined in the
last week of the mission to discuss the findings of the September 2009 FSAP Update
mission. The mission met with Prime Minister Raila Odinga, Deputy Prime Minister
and Finance Minister Uhuru Kenyatta, Central Bank Governor Njuguna Ndung’u,
other senior government officials as well as representatives of the business community,
labor unions, religious leaders, civil society, and Kenya’s development partners.
Background Papers: “Spillover Effects and the EAC: Explaining the Slowdown and
Recovery”; “The Global Financial Crisis and Adjustment to Shocks in Kenya,
Tanzania and Uganda—A Balance Sheet Analysis Perspective”; and “Foreign
Exchange Reserve Adequacy in the East African Community Countries”; which were
discussed at a seminar with government officials.
Exchange Rate Regime: Kenya has accepted the obligations of Article VIII,
Section 2, 3, and 4 and maintains an exchange system free of restrictions on payments
and transfers for current international transactions.
Economic Statistics: Broadly adequate for surveillance purposes, but weaknesses
remain, especially regarding balance of payments data (Appendix III).
Fund Relations: The 2008 Article IV consultation was concluded in September 2008,
when the Executive Board also discussed the ex post assessment of Kenya’s long-term
program engagement with the Fund. In May 2009, the Executive Board approved a
disbursement under the RAC-ESF of SDR 135.7 million (50 percent of quota) to
support the balance of payments and help the economy adjust to exogenous shocks.
More recently, Kenya also benefited from the allocation of SDRs including both the
general and special allocations, by about US$350 million.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
The Article IV discussions took place against the background of a nascent recovery
from several adverse shocks that hit the economy beginning in 2008. The shocks affected
economic activity and resulted in a loss of international reserves, threatening macroeconomic
stability. Discussions focused on policies to strengthen growth and preserve macroeconomic
stability. There was broad agreement on economic prospects and key policy issues:


Economic prospects: After a moderate recovery in the first half of 2009, near and
medium term prospects are broadly favorable, but risks remain. Staff expects that GDP
growth will be about 4½ percent in 2010/11, and stay below its potential of 6 percent, at
least until 2012/13. While the authorities agreed with staff on the near term prospects,
they were more optimistic than staff regarding medium term growth.



Fiscal policy: There was broad agreement that fiscal policy in 2009/10 should stimulate
the economy, while preserving debt sustainability. Both staff and the authorities agreed
that a deficit of around 6 percent of GDP would be appropriate to provide the required
stimulus, through additional expenditure on infrastructure, food security, and pro-poor
programs. The authorities remained committed to a fiscal anchor of 40 percent debt to
GDP ratio, and were optimistic that after the temporary departure from the anchor due
to countercyclical policies, they would converge to the target over the medium term as
the stimulus is gradually withdrawn.



Monetary policy: Staff supports CBK’s countercyclical policies, which helped provide
ample liquidity, brought interest rate down and kept GDP growth from falling further
than it would otherwise have. Going forward, staff recommended that as the fiscal
stimulus is gradually withdrawn and economic activity picks up, the focus should shift
to safeguarding price stability. To better anchor monetary policy, staff recommends that
the authorities give consideration to an eventual switch to inflation targeting and work
on pre-conditions for such a move.



External stability: The real exchange rate (corrected for the overestimated CPI), has
appreciated, and the external current account widened. However, there was broad
agreement that these seemed to reflect fundamental factors. Reserves remain at
comfortable levels, although still below the levels of Kenya’s EAC partners.



Structural reforms: Staff notes that though partial progress was evident in the
implementation of structural reforms in the fiscal arena, the reform agenda appears to
have stalled in key areas, especially those requiring the enactment of legislation. There
was agreement that in order to improve on competitiveness and increase growth
outcomes, faster progress was required in implementation.



FSAP Mission: The authorities broadly concurred with the main findings and
recommendations of the September 2009 FSAP Update but had reservations with
respect to the banking supervision assessment. Staff commends the CBK for proactive
measures which mitigated the impact of the global financial crisis on banks. Remaining
risks and vulnerabilities in the financial system need to be addressed.

6
I. BACKGROUND
1.
Kenya’s economic performance improved considerably in the 2004–07 period.
Sound economic policies, coupled with a favorable external environment contributed to an
average real GDP growth of 6 percent, peaking at 7 percent in 2007. Significant progress was
made in addressing structural issues in the financial sector. Some progress was achieved in
addressing weaknesses in public financial management and governance, but much still
remains to be done to accelerate economic growth through further structural reforms.
2.
The progress Kenya achieved on the growth and poverty reduction fronts stalled
in 2008 due to a series of adverse developments, including the global economic crisis.
Post election violence in early 2008 affected economic activity while inflation accelerated
due to the supply disruptions and dislocations, and an accommodative monetary policy.
Successive shocks, including rising international prices, particularly of fuel and fertilizer; and
poor rainfall in October–November 2008, exacerbated the decline in maize production and
resulted in a food shortage. The spillover effect of the global financial crisis slowed export
growth, tourism receipts, remittances and private capital inflows.
3.
The political situation is generally stable, but appears to be constraining
consensus on key issues. The coalition government that came to power under the terms of a
power sharing arrangement in 2008 continues to face challenges. These include forming a
consensus to advance the implementation of key structural reforms to support growth,
implementation of the recommendations of the enquiry into the post-election violence, and
the enactment of a new constitution that addresses long standing political grievances.
4.
Recent Fund advice in the context of surveillance as well as technical assistance
has assisted the authorities in improving macroeconomic policy management (Box 1).
At the conclusion of the 2008 Article IV Consultation, during which the ex post assessment
of Kenya’s longer term engagement with the Fund was discussed, Executive Directors
commended the Kenyan authorities for maintaining economic stability in the wake of postelection turmoil of early 2008, and encouraged them to anchor fiscal policy on a ratio of total
public debt to GDP. Directors also underscored the need to improve the monetary operations
framework, and address the methodological flaws in the compilation of the CPI. They
stressed the need for continued structural and governance reforms, and endorsed the findings
of the ex post assessment mission. The authorities have since allowed fiscal policy to be
guided by a debt to GDP ratio anchor, and have updated the GAP. A revised CPI series was
issued in early November. Introduction of new CPI series, using an updated basket and
weights, is planned for February 2010.1

1

In the meantime, staff macroeconomic assessments and projections are based on a modified series produced
by staff that takes account of the overestimation.

7

Box 1. The Authorities’ Response to Past Fund Advice
Kenya’s relationship with the Fund improved after 2006, as the Fund increasingly put greater emphasis
on macrocriticality of structural conditionality. The authorities became more receptive to Fund advice,
and important progress was made on monetary, fiscal and financial sector policies.
Monetary and exchange rate policy: Important reforms, such as the introduction of an OMO process, a
policy rate, and the horizontal repurchase agreement came out of TA recommendations. The authorities
also came to accept Fund advice to allow full exchange and interest rate flexibility.
Fiscal policy: Fiscal policy advice implementation was generally good. Recent reforms improved
tracking of aid flows, preparation of a draft organic budget law, implementation of new computerized
financial information system, IFMIS, and preparatory work on program budgeting. Enactment of the
PFM and other bills has been delayed.
Financial sector policy: Fund advice focused on strengthening the independence and oversight
operations of the CBK, as well as aligning its legal and regulatory framework with international best
practices. Fund advice supported the transfer of supervisory powers from the Ministry of Finance to the
CBK, and introduction of an anti-money laundering bill. To foster financial sector development, TA has
been provided on payments system; development of a secondary market for debt, and capital market
oversight and regulation. Delays have been marked in areas requiring legislative change.

II. MULTIPLE SHOCKS WEAKEN ECONOMIC PERFORMANCE
Economic performance deteriorated in the aftermath of the multiple shocks that affected the
economy since 2008. Fiscal and monetary policies appropriately aimed to support economic
activity. Concerns about declining official reserves levels and a deterioration of the current
account balance led the authorities to seek Fund financial assistance.
5.
Exogenous shocks, including high international food and fuel prices, global and
regional slowdown, affected Kenya’s economic performance in 2008, bringing real GDP
growth down to 1¾ percent, from 7 percent in 2007. After reaching a peak of 31.5 percent
in May 2008, headline inflation declined, and stood at 17.9 percent in September 2009.2 The
steady decline largely reflects a pass through of lower international food and fuel prices and
the slowdown of economic activity.

These rates are based on the old methodology, which overestimates inflation.

Fiscal operations in 2008/09 fell short of the intended stimulus of 2.1 percent of
GDP (cyclically adjusted). Both nominal revenue and expenditure were below the budgeted
level, reflecting a slowing economy and low implementation rates for foreign-funded
projects, respectively. 3 In addition, the unfavorable market environment led to the
postponement of a planned sovereign bond issue and privatization.

The overall balance of payments weakened substantially after mid-2008,
resulting in a loss of reserves by the end of fiscal year 2008/09 (July–June). In particular,
the current account deficit widened to 7¾ percent of GDP, compared to 4½ percent of GDP
the previous year, reflecting subdued agricultural exports and high imports stemming from
increased maize imports and a relatively high oil import bill, notwithstanding the decline in
world prices. At the same time, private capital flows declined sharply. As a result, the overall
balance for 2008/09 registered a deficit US$423 million, (1½ percent of GDP). The deficit
was financed in part by a drawdown on reserves and the June 2009 Fund assistance of about
US$207 million under the RAC-ESF. Gross reserves stood at US$3.2 billion (3¼ months of
import cover) at end-June, 2009.
III. THE RAC-ESF DISBURSEMENT PROVIDED SOME BREATHING SPACE
The outlook for global growth and commodity prices is more favorable than envisaged at the
time of the authorities’ request for financial support under the RAC-ESF, and the external
position has improved. At the country level, economic conditions also improved, but
prolonged drought has weakened agricultural output and hydroelectric power generation,
resulting in the need to increase maize and petroleum imports to address food and
hydroelectricity shortage. Progress on structural reforms is slow.
9.
Macroeconomic performance and adjustment to the various exogenous shocks
improved moderately after the disbursement of SDR135.7 million under the RAC-ESF
but new challenges have emerged. The disbursement was meant to close the estimated
cumulative financing gap for 2008/09 and 2009/10, while enabling an orderly rebuilding of
foreign reserves. In the aftermath of the disbursement, foreign reserves reached almost
3.7 months of imports at end-September, including the US$350 million of general and
special SDR allocations. Overall and food inflation declined. The decline in food inflation

10
was particularly aided by the large imports of maize, which filled the gap in domestic supply
and stabilized prices. The authorities also increased expenditures on infrastructure and propoor programs, while supporting aggregate demand. The prolonged drought poses new
challenges to the balance of payments stemming from higher levels of imports of maize and
fuel than envisaged at the time of the RAC-ESF.
10.
Some progress has been made on structural and governance reform
commitments made as part of the request for the RAC-ESF, however, much remains to
be done. After some delays, a revised CPI series based on a new methodology was released
in early November and a pilot income support scheme has been designed.4 The GAP has been
updated, and some progress has been achieved in increasing transparency and access to
government information by the public, for instance, in the area of public procurement.
However, the PFM Bill, meant to address some weaknesses in structural fiscal issues, and the
Banking Act (Amendment) Bill, which is meant to strengthen the hand of the CBK by
authorizing consolidated supervision and prompt corrective action, are yet to be brought
before Parliament. The plan to undertake a private capital flows surveys has been postponed
to early 2010.
IV. THE OUTLOOK IS CHALLENGING
Economic growth is projected to remain below potential in the near term, and recover
gradually over the medium term. Risks to the outlook are broadly balanced. Weather-related
shocks cannot be ruled out.
11.
Near term prospects are challenging, and economic growth is projected to
remain subdued in 2009 and early 2010. The prospects for agriculture are worse than
envisaged during the RAC-ESF disbursement, due to lower than expected rainfall. Given that
Kenya is fairly well integrated into the global economy, recent improvements in economic
conditions in advanced economies could benefit the Kenyan economy in the near term
though exports, remittances, and net FDI are likely to remain below pre-crisis levels. A
background analytical study which explores the role of spillover effects in explaining the
slowdown and recovery found that spillover effects generally explain economic performance
in the EAC. In the case of Kenya, the mild recovery in 2009 relative to 2008 is mainly
premised on improved terms of trade and private financial flows (Box 2).5 Staff estimates
that GDP growth will be around 2¾ percent in 2009, and reach only 4½ percent in 2010.

4

A comprehensive vulnerability program (V-Program) has been designed to protect vulnerable and poor
households in urban and rural areas from the effects of food insecurity. The pilot program, covering 40,000
households is to be implemented in Nairobi, Mombasa and Kisumu.

11

Box 2. Spillover Effects and the EAC: Explaining the Slowdown and Recovery
Much of the recent downturn in the EAC can be explained by spillovers, according to estimates from a
dynamic panel model for countries in the region. The model relates real growth in domestic output to
world growth weighted by trading partner countries and to several control variables: oil prices, non-oil
prices, a measure of global financial stress, and country fixed effects (see Drummond and Ramirez,
2009). The results suggest that spillover effects generally explain economic performance. Some
domestic developments, including policy responses also seem to be at play.
Key messages

In Kenya, the downturn came early in 2008 as the country suffered from external shocks
amplified by adverse domestic developments. In 2009, the country is expected to post a mild
recovery with positive spillovers largely arising from positive terms of trade and a recovery of net
private capital flows.


The EAC countries have generally responded to the slowdown with monetary and fiscal policy
easing. Growth in the region is expected to rebound in 2010 and 2011 helped by a turnaround in
trade as well as domestic stimulus. While the precise pace of the projected recovery remains
highly uncertain, it seems that it might take at least a few years, for growth to catch-up with precrisis levels. In the coming years, adjustments to macroeconomic policy stances will be needed to
sustain a strong recovery.

The authorities and private sector groups were confident that an economic
recovery was already underway. They pointed out that tourist arrivals have now risen to
pre-crisis levels, and manufacturing output has been strong, responding to regional EAC
demand. They were of the opinion that global economic recovery would boost tourism,
exports, and remittances, and that given the revival in business and consumer confidence,
Kenya’s perception as an investment destination could improve. Staff concurs with the
assessment, but pointed out that the impact is likely to manifest in the medium term.
13.
Against this background, staff expects GDP growth to recover gradually, from
2¼ percent in 2008/09 to 6⅓ percent in the medium term. Under this baseline scenario,
savings and investment would pick up gradually, and reach their pre-crisis level by the end of

12
2010/11. As the savings rate increases, the current account deficit is projected to decline to
3½ percent of GDP by 2013/14, from 7 percent of GDP in 2009/10. This, together with the
projected pickup in capital flows would allow for a gradual reserves buildup to 4 months of
imports, from 3.7 months of imports currently.
14.
The outlook is subject to risks. On the upside, there are incipient signs of recovery
in business confidence, supported by appropriate fiscal and monetary policies. Another
upside risk is a faster-than-currently envisaged global recovery. Downside risks include a
more protracted global slowdown, and tensions within the coalition government which could
impact negatively on investor confidence. In this regard, having a transparent constitutional
referendum process is crucial. Delay in addressing infrastructure gaps and structural reforms
could also weigh down growth prospects, while weather-related shocks are possible.
V. POLICY DISCUSSIONS
A. Discussions focused on policies aimed at putting the economy back on a sustainable
growth trajectory. The main challenge is to provide the necessary stimulus while
maintaining medium-term debt sustainability and keeping an eye on inflation.
Maintaining vigilance in the financial sector and external stability remain crucial. At the
same time, structural reforms to buttress the economy’s resilience, improve governance
and competitiveness need to be pursued. Supporting Economic Activity and Preserving
Fiscal Sustainability
15.
The authorities plan to maintain countercyclical fiscal stance in 2009/10, and
staff estimate the planned additional fiscal stimulus to be in order of 2.1 percent of
(cyclically adjusted) GDP. The increase in the deficit reflects mainly higher domesticallyfinanced development spending, including in particular a stimulus package targeted at key
infrastructure projects. The execution rate for foreign-financed capital expenditure is
expected to improve, in part due to the kick-off of a number of large infrastructure projects. 6
Moreover, the authorities are undertaking additional measures to improve the execution rate,
including: (i) setting up more frequent monitoring and review of projects; (ii) more active
engagement of development partners through regular review meetings; and (iii) more
rigorous selection criteria for inclusion of new projects in the budget. Revenue is projected to
increase only slightly, consistent with the mild recovery in economic activity. Expenditureprioritization and savings will serve to bring recurrent primary spending back to pre-crisis
level.
16.
Staff stressed the importance of maintaining the stimulus through the recovery
process, while paying attention to medium-term fiscal sustainability. Staff recommended that
over the medium term and as the economy recovers, the stimulus should be gradually

withdrawn, with a view of converging towards the medium-term net debt-to-GDP target of
40 percent.7 The authorities were receptive to the recommendation, and stated that they plan
to begin to gradually withdraw the stimulus in 2010/11, and bring the deficit down from
6 percent of GDP to about 4½ percent of GDP by 2011/12 as economic growth gains ground.

17.
Staff agreed with the authorities’ strategy, but noted that the fiscal outlook is not
without risks. The prolonged drought and the expected shortfall in maize harvest has
brought additional pressures on the fiscal position, and additional expenditures on food
security and drought mitigation is estimated at about ¾ percent of GDP.8 Tax revenues may
be lower than projected if the slowdown turns out to be more severe than expected, and a
1 percent slower-than-projected economic recovery could contribute an extra 0.1–0.2 percent
of GDP to the deficit. In addition, planned savings in recurrent expenditures—about
⅓ percentage points of GDP—may fall short of the mark.
18.
Staff recommended that if these risks were to materialize, the deficit should not be
allowed to exceed 6½ percent of GDP, i.e., ½ percent of GDP higher than projected. Staff
indicated that (i) this stance already entails a substantial stimulus; (ii) additional bank
financing could lead to crowding out of credit to the private sector; and (iii) a higher deficit
in 2009/10 would create doubts about the feasibility of bringing deficits back down to
sustainable levels in later years, particularly in an electoral context. The authorities concurred
7

Departure from the 35 percent debt to GDP ratio anchor agreed in (Country Report No. 08/339) is due to the
recent multiple shocks Kenya faced, which have significantly weakened medium-term growth prospects, thus
requiring the countercyclical fiscal policy stance.

This figure could be lower if the current rains continue normally, thereby obviating the need for drought relief
measures.

with staff recommendation and emphasized their intention to contain expenditure within the
budgetary envelop as much as possible. In addition, they plan to raise most of the domestic
debt from nonbank sources, so as to minimize the crowding out of banking system credit to
the private sector.9
19.
Kenya’s public and external debt indicators show a low risk of debt distress. The
May 2009 debt sustainability analysis remains appropriate even in light of recent
developments.10 It suggests that under the baseline scenario, Kenya’s debt indicators are
below the indicative thresholds for a medium performer. Under alternative scenarios and
stress tests, external debt indicators are generally resilient, while total public debt indicators
are at greater risk of unfavorable developments, especially under a shock to GDP growth.
B. Safeguarding Price Stability While Providing Sufficient Liquidity to Support
Economic Activity
20.
Assessment of both the stance and impact of monetary policy was in the past
difficult given the flaws in the CPI series. With the release of the revised CPI, it is evident
that CBK’s countercyclical policies were appropriate, given the fact that the inflation
environment was benign. After a long period of continuous easing of monetary policy, which
began in the second half of 2008, the countercyclical actions appear to have moderated since
July 2009. Considering this, staff broadly supports the initial loosening of monetary policy,
which has helped support growth, including by allowing for increased government borrowing
to be financed without driving interest rates up. Nevertheless, concerns with inflation remain,
especially as the economy enters a recovery phase.
Box 3. Results of the Revision to the CPI Methodology
The KNBS released a revised CPI showing
that headline inflation averaged
12.8 percent in the past two years,
compared to the reported average of
22.5 percent. The revised series is based on
the current basket, but the linked-Carli
aggregation method, which contains a
substantial upward bias, was replaced with a
geometric mean method.

Staff considers that further monetary easing is not warranted, and policy should
progressively shift focus to safeguarding price stability. Staff argued that given ample
bank liquidity, the strengthening economy, and the envisaged fiscal stimulus, further easing
could increase inflationary pressures in the future. Besides, while the impact of monetary
easing on inflation might be small in the relatively benign current environment of weak
aggregate demand, this may not be so as the economy recovers. Price stability should be a
prime focus of monetary policy, and a comprehensive revised CPI would facilitate the
assessment of its effectiveness. Staff welcomes the revised CPI as it corrects the previous
over-estimation. The planned introduction of a new CPI series based on a revised, broadbased basket would further increase the reliability of the index.
22.
The implementation of monetary operations needs to be further improved. First,
recent monetary policy statements have indicated that the central bank policy rate (used for
lending to banks) is being lowered to signal CBK’s intention to ease monetary policy and
exert downward pressure on market rates. However, while the lending rates have come down
slightly, they remain high due to structural impediments that lead to a weak transmission
mechanism between the CBR and market rates. Second, CBK has been using the CRR
instrument to inject liquidity into the system. However, adjustments to the CRR are not good
for active liquidity management. Third, monetary policy intentions are not conveyed with
sufficient clarity and specific reference to monetary targets. Instead, in monetary policy
statements, envisaged actions are generally expressed in terms of policy rate changes, whose
impact on both market rates and monetary aggregates is, at best, not well established.
The authorities agreed with staff’s assessment, and stated that they are working
towards a better understanding of the monetary transmission mechanism. In this regard,
they are developing a model to aid their understanding and enhance policy implementation,
and they plan to share preliminary results with staff in early December. In the meantime,
broad money remains the nominal anchor and reserve money the operational target.
However, given the uncertainties in money demand, an inflation targeting regime could
eventually be considered once further progress has been made on pre-conditions for
switching to such a regime. In the meantime, staff encouraged CBK to rely on the use of its
other monetary instruments such as repos/reverse repos and/or foreign exchange
sales/purchases for liquidity management.
C. Maintaining Vigilance in the Financial Sector
Despite the overall economic weakness, the recent FSAP Update mission concluded that
the banking sector remains sound. Banks’ financial conditions were generally good and
aggregate capitalization is almost 20 percent on a risk-weighted basis. This compares well
with a required minimum of 12 percent and a 17–18 percent average for sub-Saharan African
countries. The quality of capital appears good, with most being core capital.11 Though the
rapid growth in credit over the last few years raises the specter of asset quality deterioration,
11

Core capital is Basel tier 1 capital less intangible assets.

16
particularly in the context of a slowing economy, NPL ratio, at 9 percent in August 2009, is
low by comparison with that of 2007. Notwithstanding the high credit growth, the banking
system has become more resilient, and macroeconomic stress tests scenarios based on
exogenous shocks like drought, decline in tourism, a protracted global recession, and
political turmoil suggest that such shocks would not lead to insolvency.
23.
Direct effects of the global financial crisis were partially contained by CBK’s
proactive supervision. At the onset of the crisis, CBK banking supervision department
stepped up the supervision of banks in order to detect any immediate stress in the system.
Commercial banks introduced stricter appraisal of new credit facilities, coupled with close
and continuous monitoring of existing credit portfolio. Some banks limited foreign currency
loans, and reappraised relationships with foreign banks so as to limit exposure to foreign
exchange risk. A staff study (Box 4) indicates that due largely to the policies initiated, banks
were able to reduce their risk and vulnerability to exchange rate shocks.12

17
Box 4. Global Financial Crisis and Adjustment to Shocks in Kenya, Tanzania and Uganda—A
Balance Sheet Perspective
A staff study applied a limited version of the Balance Sheet Analysis (BSA) to banking system balance
sheets from Kenya, Tanzania and Uganda, with a view to determining how sectoral balances have moved
in response to the financial crisis and whether or not vulnerabilities have increased. Using both annual
(2001 – 2008) and monthly data (January 2007–May 2009), the paper analyzed the changes in the assets
and liabilities of five sectors of the economy: the central bank, the government, the banking system, the
corporate sector and households. It then derived the net financial position (NFP) and the net foreign
currency position (NFCP). NFP is overall financial assets minus financial liabilities, with a large
negative position indicating solvency problems. NFCP is foreign currency assets minus foreign currency
liabilities with a large negative (positive) position indicating vulnerability to exchange rate depreciation
(appreciation) risks.
Central banks throughout region hold positive net foreign assets, implying a loss (at book value of local
currency) in the event of exchange rate appreciation, while all other sectors were at risks of both interest
and exchange rate shocks. With respect to Kenya, it was found that the overall financial and foreign
currency positions of all sectors of the economy vis-à-vis the banking system, responded to the economic
cycle in the past 18 months. Public sector financial position deteriorated after mid 2008. This was made
possible by higher levels of domestic financing. Banks improved their net foreign currency position from
mid-2008 following substantial reduction in foreign currency liabilities, especially loans. The reduction in
foreign currency liabilities improved the net foreign currency position of the corporate private sector, and
net financial position also improved as nonrenewal of credit lines and tightening of lending standards by
banks contributed to a decline in the corporate sector’s liabilities. Household positions, however,
deteriorated in response to the economic cycle as their assets— mainly deposits—fell.

The financial sector has deepened since the 2003 FSAP, but key risks need to be
addressed. Microfinance institutions and banks’ presence have grown in lower income market
segments, presenting the SACCO sector with competition. Nevertheless, legislative authority to
address existing and possible risks, and the manpower resources for more sophisticated and
rigorous supervision, are lagging. In the capital market, corporate governance reform and plans
to demutualize the NSE, key corrective measures, are pending. The NSSF is inadequately
managed and overseen, and in the event of a systemic event impacting the fund, government’s
scope for response could be severely constrained by fiscal limitations. In addition, poor
regulation and low funding of defined benefit pension schemes could amplify financial shocks.
There are also risks and vulnerabilities from increasing regionalization, including rising foreign
entry and transactions among regional financial firms, which require more sophisticated
regulation; but progress in both cross-border and domestic consolidated supervision is slow.
25.
Several pieces of legislation—including the banking, deposit insurance and national
payments system bills—are yet to be submitted to Cabinet for final approval by the
executive. Importantly the Anti-Money Laundering Bill is still in Parliament. Without
submission and passage of these bills, supervision and control of the financial sector will remain
constrained. In addition, the finalization and implementation of the draft national pension
strategy provides an opportunity to ensure that the NSSF comply with legal requirements for
outsourcing asset management, and to reform the Civil Service Pension Scheme.
D. Mitigating External Vulnerabilities
26.
The floating exchange rate regime has continued to support macroeconomic
stability by absorbing terms of trade and other exogenous shocks. Consistent with the
regime, the authorities intend to continue to allow the exchange rate to be market-determined,
with interventions limited to smoothing out excessive exchange rate volatility, and gradually
building international reserves. Over the year to 2009Q3, the NEER depreciated by 53/4 percent
while the REER appreciated by almost 6 percent. The authorities indicated that their internal
assessment did not point to exchange rate misalignment. This assessment is in line with staff’s
REER and external stability analysis, which finds no evidence of misalignment or threat to
external stability (Box 5).

19
Box 5. External Stability and Competitiveness
Kenya’s REER has appreciated faster than those of some selected coffee and tea exporters, but the
appreciation has not as yet affected competitiveness. Between end-2007 and end-September 2009, the CPI-based
REER appreciated by 13¾ percent, using a modified CPI series. On an annual basis, the recent REER appreciation
was driven by relative price changes, as the NEER depreciated (upper right chart, below). Nonetheless, the REER
appreciation does not seem to have so far weakened Kenya’s competitiveness. Trade data suggests that Kenya has
maintained its share of world exports.
Despite the REER appreciation and the widening of the current account deficit since 2005, the CGER
methodology, using data as of end September-2009 does not point to exchange rate misalignments or external
stability problems. Two of the methods—the EREER approach and the external sustainability approach—yield
undervaluations in the 1– 9⅓ percent range (lower left quadrant). As of now, these misalignments are of no great
concern. An important caveat to the findings is the uncertainty associated with assumptions used and model
specification. The result from the EREER approach is based on the Kenya specific equation estimated in the 2008
Article IV Selected Issues Paper. It suggests that the appreciation of the REER reflects changes in fundamentals,
including high coffee and tea prices and improved productivity.
Survey-based indicators of competitiveness suggest that Kenya has room for improving its score in some
areas. Compared to its regional partners and competitors, Tanzania and Uganda, it scores relatively well on
infrastructure and property rights, and relatively poorly on burdensome government regulations and procedures.
Sri Lanka and Colombia generally score better than Kenya (lower right quadrant). Addressing weaknesses in the
selected structural areas and others would help enhance competitiveness.

27.
The authorities indicated that they will continue their strategy of building reserves.
In this regard, the SDR allocations, about US$350 million, will go to reserves buildup. Kenya’s
reserves are below the minimum of 4 months of imports that the CBK is

20
mandated to observe by the CBK Act, and below the EAC convergence criterion. Also, a
staff analysis suggests that Kenya does not fare as well as its EAC partners on several metrics
of reserves adequacy.13 Against this background, staff agreed with the authorities’ desire to
build up reserves while noting the need to be mindful of carry cost of reserves, and the
liquidity impact of the purchases on monetary aggregates and inflation.
E. Accelerating Economic Growth with Structural Reforms
28.
There has been a modest improvement in implementing fiscal structural
reforms. IFMIS has been rolled out to 48 ministries and spending units, leaving only 4 to be
covered. However, budget, procurement and payroll modules have not been deployed,
thereby limiting its effectiveness. EFT was successfully launched at the beginning of
October, and covers virtually all payments above Ksh 1 million, (about US$13,500).14
29.
Nevertheless, a significant PFM agenda—the main plank of economic
governance—remains. Staff recommended the urgent submission to Parliament of the draft
PFM bill. The bill aims at revising the legal framework for public finance management to
ensure appropriate budget execution, accounting and internal audit. Staff also recommended:
(i) improving treasury cash management (including making operational the treasury single
account); (ii) monitoring and managing the growth of semi-autonomous government agencies
and extra-budgetary funds; and (iii) improving the coverage, reliability and relevance of inyear fiscal accounting and reporting. In addition, plans to quantify contingent liabilities have
been partially completed, and staff recommended adopting policies aimed at moderating their
size. The authorities are planning to submit a PPP bill to parliament, in the meanwhile, they
have issued regulations under a law on specialized procurement as an interim measure.
30.
The authorities acknowledged the slow pace of legislative enactments, which
affected the PFM, AML, Banking, Deposit Insurance, National Payment System; and
several other bills. They indicated that the problems were in part related to limited
availability of personnel with parliamentary drafting skills in the Attorney General’s
department. As a result, there were significant delays in submitting bills to Parliament.
However, they emphasized that this did not indicate a wavering commitment on their part, and
that a number of bills would be submitted during the November session of Parliament.
A number of reforms of monetary operations have been implemented, but much
31.
remains to be done to improve the transmission mechanism of monetary policy. Recent
reforms include the extension of the tenure of repo securities, and changes in the framework
for forecasting liquidity for better estimates of monetary conditions. Staff was of the view

21
that the newly introduced HRA should be used more widely by banks in the interbank
market, as this could improve the distribution of liquidity among banks, which is sometimes
skewed. The authorities agreed, but stated that the use of HRA has been limited due to
delayed issuance of settlement agreements which created concerns of counterparty risks. In
addition, they noted that several banks are still on a learning curve, and the shallowness of
the secondary market necessitated deep haircuts when they use the facility. They were
optimistic that over time, its usage would become popular.
32.
The First Medium-Term Plan (MTP) 2008-2012 of Kenya Vision 2030 was
officially transmitted as the authorities’ PRSP. The MTP is the near-term program for the
Kenya Vision 2030 long-term development blueprint, which was launched in 2007 after a
broad-based consultation process. Both the MTP and Vision 2030 have the overriding goal of
making Kenya a “globally competitive and prosperous nation with a high quality of life” by
2030, and are anchored on three pillars: an economic, a social and a political pillar. The
economic pillar underpins the vision for growth and development. The social pillar seeks to
build a just, cohesive society with equitable social development in a clean and secure
environment. The political pillar aims at realizing a democratic political system that nurtures
issue-based politics, respects the rule of law, and protects all the rights and freedom of every
individual in society. Preparation of a Joint Staff Advisory Note by staffs of IMF and World
Bank is underway.
33.
The authorities pointed to recent measures aimed at reducing taxes on imports
and reiterated their desire to pursue trade liberalization efforts and to maintain an
exchange system free of restrictions. The 2009/10 Finance Act contains several measures
that reduce import taxes on several consumption and capital goods, with the aim of
supporting economic growth, protecting jobs, and reducing poverty. Also, in response to the
shortage of maize resulting from the drought, the authorities allowed temporary duty-free
import of maize, until February 2010. However, the recent increase in import duties on
wheat, aimed at protecting local farmers, is a setback. In addition, sugar imports remain
constrained by a ceiling on duty free imports from COMESA countries and a 100 percent
duty beyond the duty free quota. The authorities noted that existing tariffs will be reviewed in
the context of the EAC customs union scheduled for 2010. They indicated that EAC
negotiations with the EU in the context of its EPA were at a standstill owing to a number of
unresolved issues.
VI. STAFF APPRAISAL
34.
Kenya’s robust expansion since 2003 has been cut short by a series of shocks.
Sound macroeconomic policies, progressive implementation of structural reforms, and a
favorable external environment supported the expansion. The economic outlook has changed
sharply as a result various shocks in 2008, including the global financial crisis, even though
the direct effects of the crisis on the domestic financial system were modest. The economy
has already shown signs of recovery, but the pace of growth is projected to be below
potential at least until 2011/12. There are downside risks to the outlook: a deeper or more

22
protracted global downturn than currently anticipated or deteriorating domestic economic and
political conditions could lower growth.
35.
Fiscal policy needs to strike an appropriate balance between stimulating the
economy and preserving debt sustainability. The 2009/10 budget, which targets a deficit
of around 6 percent of GDP is broadly appropriate to provide the required stimulus.
However, given risks to both revenue and expenditure, additional expenditure could be
needed to support the recovery and the most vulnerable people. In this regard, an increase in
the deficit, by about ½ percentage point of GDP could be warranted. Given the temporary
departure from the fiscal anchor to accommodate cyclical developments, convergence to the
anchor in the medium term should be a prime objective of fiscal policy.
36.
The easing of monetary policy by CBK was appropriate, but the focus now needs
to turn to safeguarding price stability and reforming the monetary policy framework.
CBK’s countercyclical policies together with the low level of economic activity allowed for
subdued interest rate, and kept GDP from falling further than it would otherwise have. Given
the nascent strengthening of private sector activity, and ongoing fiscal stimulus, the focus
should now shift to safeguarding price stability. The release of a revised CPI is welcome, and
the planned release of a new series in February would facilitate the proper monitoring of
price developments and the effectiveness of policy. Monetary policy intermediate targets
need to be stated with clarity and available instruments need to be employed decisively in
order to achieve these targets. In this regard, reforms of the monetary framework, including
planned analytical work on the transmission of monetary policy is welcome, and moving to
an inflation targeting regime could be considered once the necessary pre-requisites have been
met.
37.
The financial sector has so far weathered the immediate impact of the global
crisis well, but risks remains. Staff commends the CBK for proactive measures which
mitigated the impact of the global financial crisis on the balance sheet of banks, and
recommend that it stands ready to address any emerging weakness going forward. The
assessment of the FSAP mission that the banking sector remains well-capitalized and
adequately provisioned is reassuring. CBK would need to continue engaging with banks to
ensure that provisions and capital buffers remain adequate to meet future risks. Remaining
risks in the financial sector such as inadequate regulation and funding of social security fund
and other pension schemes; the regulation and supervision of cross border transactions; and
risks from increasing regionalization; should be addressed expeditiously.
38.
While the external current account deficit has increased, there appear to be no
major risks to external stability. The appreciation of the real exchange rate seems broadly
in line with economic fundamentals, with strong capital inflows financing the current account
deficit and foreign reserves increasing. Under these circumstances, foreign exchange market
interventions should remain limited to smoothing excessive short-term volatility and meeting
the foreign reserve target.

23
39.
Advancing broad-based structural and governance reforms to ensure strong
economic growth over the medium and long term should remain a priority. Priority
should be given to the reforms of public finance management, governance, and financial
sector which are much needed to complement sound macroeconomic policies. Improvement
of human resource to facilitate the speedy drafting and review of new bills is essential. The
introduction of an income support scheme aimed at protecting the vulnerable and poor
households would address food deficit in an efficient manner.
40.
It is recommended that the next Article IV consultation be held on the standard
12-month cycle.

Sources: Kenyan authorities; and IMF staff estimates and projections.
1/ The foreign travel credit is comprised of two components, recorded tourism inflows and an estimate of additional under-reported tourism receipts.
2/ Historical figures include errors and omissions.
3/ Starting in 2008/09, change in arrears reflects the amounts in the budget. For earlier years, there are differences with the fiscal sector tables (Tables 2a and 2b) because
the government's budget presentation does not show changes to arrears associated with disputed security-related contracts.

1/ The foreign travel credit is comprised of two components, recorded tourism inflows and an estimate of additional under-reported tourism receipts.
2/ Historical figures include errors and omissions.
3/ Starting in 2008/09, change in arrears reflects the amounts in the budget. For earlier years, there are differences with the fiscal sector tables (Tables 2a and 2b) because the government's
budget presentation does not show changes to arrears associated with disputed security-related contracts.

The last three-year PRGF arrangement was approved on November 21, 2003, in the amount
of SDR 175 million. Access was augmented to SDR 225 million at the time of the first
review on December 20, 2004, to address the impact of a drought and higher oil prices. In
light of a balance of payments improvement and at the request of the authorities, access was
reduced to SDR 150 million at the time of the second review. The arrangement expired on

3
November 20, 2007. In May 2009, the Executive Board approved the disbursement of
SDR135.7 under the RAC-ESF to address the impact of exogenous shocks and the balance of
payments gap.

Safeguards Assessments

An update safeguards assessment of the Central Bank of Kenya (CBK) took place in
Spring 2009 with respect to the authorities request for a disbursement under the RapidAccess Component of the Exogenous Shocks Facility (ESF). The update assessment found
increased safeguards risk at the CBK since the 2005 assessment. The report noted that
deficiencies found in recent external audits and non-compliance with the benchmark financial
reporting framework confirmed that audit oversight is not yet fully effective, and that it has
impaired external audit and financial reporting. Steps are being taken by the CBK and the
external auditor to strengthen the ongoing 2009 external audit process.
X.

Exchange Arrangements

Kenya's currency is the shilling, which floats against other currencies. The official exchange
rate, which is set at the previous day’s average market rate, applies only to government and
government-guaranteed external debt-service payments and to government imports for which
there is a specific budget allocation. The exchange rate regime is a managed float, in which
the U.S. dollar is the principal intervention currency. Kenya has accepted the obligations of
Article VIII, Sections 2, 3, and 4, and maintains an exchange system free of restrictions on
payments and transfers for current international transactions, other than restrictions notified
to the Fund under Decision No. 144 (52/51). On November 20, 2009, the exchange rate was
K Sh 74.5 =US$1.00.

IX. KENYA: KEY STATISTICAL ISSUES
Data provision has some shortcomings, but is broadly adequate for surveillance and program
monitoring. Weaknesses in macroeconomic statistics reflect organizational and skill
shortcomings, and inadequate resources. In line with the new Statistics Law, the government
established the autonomous Kenya National Bureau of Statistics (KNBS) in 2007 to replace
the Central Bureau of Statistics (CBS).
41.
The Report on the Observance of Standards and Codes—Data Module (IMF Country
Report No. 05/388) published on October 31, 2005 stated that methodological soundness is
uneven across datasets and significant improvement is required in government finance
statistics and national accounts. Accuracy and reliability do not receive adequate attention in
any of the datasets, while accessibility of the disseminated macroeconomic statistics are
adequate, except for the balance of payments statistics.
42.
Kenya participates in the Fund’s General Data Dissemination System (GDDS) and the
GDDS project for Anglophone Africa. Metadata and detailed plans for improving the data
over the short and medium term are posted on the Fund’s Dissemination Standards Bulletin
Board (DSBB). Kenya has received Fund technical assistance. Further assessment of capacity
building requirements has been undertaken by the AFRITAC East Statistical Advisor.
43.
Monetary, exchange rate, and some external data are published on a monthly and
biannual basis by the KNBS in its Monthly Economic Review. Core financial data are also
made available to the Fund on a regular basis. A detailed account of various sectoral activities
and the corresponding statistical data are published annually by the KNBS in its Economic
Survey.
National accounts
44.
Data quality has deteriorated significantly because of budgetary and staff constraints at
the KNBS. GDP is believed to be significantly underestimated, as important and increasing
parts of the economy, such as the informal sector, nonagriculture subsistence, horticulture,
and self-employed professionals are not properly covered. An STA peripatetic advisor
assisted the authorities in rebasing the national accounts estimates at constant 2001 prices and
compiling institutional accounts for the general government sector. As a result, national
accounts estimates for the years 1996–2005 in current and constant (2001) prices) have been
published. Quarterly national accounts are being developed with the assistance of the
AFRITAC East. Quarterly GDP estimates are now published.
Prices and production
6.
In early 2002, the KNBS (then CBS) began publication of a new national CPI
(covering 13 urban towns), with 1997 as reference year and outdated weights and basket of
items derived from the 1993–94 Household Budget Survey (HBS). Indices are produced for
lower and middle/upper income groups in Nairobi and other cities. The index is compiled
and published on a timely basis. No producer, export, or import price indices are produced.
In March 2008, a TA mission assisted the authorities in identifying the methodological issues

9
relating to the measurement of inflation. The current methodology of aggregating prices at
the elementary level was found to impart a substantial upward bias on CPI measurement. In
line with STA recommendations, the KNBS released a revised series that is consistent with
international best practices in November 2009. They plan to publish a new series in
February 2010, with rebasing and reweighing of the CPI basket.
Government finance statistics (GFS)
7.
The data ROSC mission emphasized a number of key areas in GFS compilation that
should be improved, including: (i) migration to the GFSM 2001 methodology;
(ii) broadening the coverage to include extrabudgetary and social security funds and report
on a general government level; (iii) reconciliation of fiscal statistics from various sources to
limit discrepancies; (iv) improve information on external financing, particularly on
expenditure directly financed from abroad; (v) compilation and dissemination of monthly and
quarterly budget execution data; and (vi) training of Ministry of Finance (MOF) staff in the
GFS methodology.
8.
Since the beginning of FY 2005/06, Kenya has followed a new economic
classification of the budget based on GFSM 2001 (with assistance from the AFRITAC-East).
However, serious delays have emerged in reporting, reflecting difficulties in establishing
budget execution and accounting systems consistent with the new classification. To ensure
timely reconciliation and monitoring of budget execution, the existing systems would need to
be promptly upgraded and made operational. Progress has been made toward moving to the
IFMIS. There are still important gaps in ensuring proper reconciliation of fiscal data from
different sources, including from various units within the MOF. The discrepancies in budget
outturn data (between deficit/surplus and financing) remain significant, and the recording of
external financing and expenditure directly financed from abroad is still an important area for
improvement. The government has taken some steps to initiate a project to
rationalize/eliminate extrabudgetary funds, but the progress in compiling consolidated fiscal
statistics has remained limited.
9.
The country reports data to STA for the budgetary central government for inclusion in
the GFS Yearbook, albeit with a significant lag—the last data reported were for the year
ending June 2005. The KNBS compiles the aggregate annual GFS revenue and expenditure
data for the budgetary central government based on detailed data in the reports of the
Controller and Auditor General. The data submitted for publication in the 2007 GFS
Yearbook was reported in GFSM 2001 format, using bridge tables developed by the technical
assistance missions. The recent steps taken in the migration to GFSM 2001 may help reduce
the significant differences between KNBS data and the data compiled by the MOF and
reported to AFR for surveillance and program monitoring purposes. Monthly and quarterly
data are regularly reported for inclusion in the IFS.
Monetary statistics
10.
Progress has been shown in the implementation of the Monetary and Financial
Statistics Manual (MFSM) and development of the standardized report forms (SRFs). The
authorities submitted SRF test data; however, there has not been further progress. In March

10
2007, a STA mission established the standardized report form for the data on the central bank;
reviewed and revised the reporting form and compilation notes for the other depository
corporations (ODCs) in line with MFSM data requirements; and identified the coverage of the
ODC subsector. The mission found misclassification of a number of central government deposits
as private sector deposits. A major issue for future work relates to the expansion of the coverage
of the ODCs to include the Savings and Credit Cooperatives (SACCOS). As of end-March, 2007,
there were 3,800 SACCOs, accounting for about 30percent of the total deposits of the banking
system. When implemented, a new bill providing for increased supervision over SACCOs would
generate data as part of the supervisory function. A follow-up mission in June 2007 conducted a
workshop for officials of ODCs and established a system for reporting Form 1SR to the IMF.
The new Standardized Reporting System for reporting ODCs’ data to the central bank was also
finalized. There is no ongoing TA, but, if needed, Kenya can benefit from participating in the
monetary module of the next phase DFID project that will commence in 2010.

External sector statistics
11.
The KNBS compiles annual balance of payments statistics in Kenya shillings that are
regularly reported to STA, although with considerable delay. In addition, the Central Bank
of Kenya (CBK) compiles a complete set of annual balance of payments statistics in
U.S. dollars, which are reported to AFR and used for programming and surveillance
purposes. The two datasets are not entirely consistent, and Fund staff has strongly
encouraged the authorities to reconcile them. More recently, the CBK also started to compile
and publish quarterly balance of payments estimates.
12.
Although the overall quality of trade data may be reasonably good, data for other
current account and many financial account transactions are rather weak. Following the
liberalization of the exchange system in 1993–94, gaps emerged in coverage. The compilation
system (other than that used for compiling customs statistics), used since 1994, relies on
reports from domestic banks and may result in a substantial under-recording of current
earnings, including tourism receipts; investment flows of the private sector; as well as
transactions that are settled via accounts held abroad.
13.
Present estimates of direct and portfolio investment are believed to be substantially
understated. The large positive errors and omissions in the central bank data that have emerged in
the balance of payments since 1994 give rise to uncertainties as to the potential size of external
obligations. The MOF compiles data covering public and publicly guaranteed external debt
obligations to official and commercial creditors. This database does not take into account
nonresident purchases of the government’s domestic currency-denominated debt securities. In
developing the loan-by-loan debt sustainability analysis (DSA) in 2002, Fund and World Bank
staff identified several significant debt data problems that have been addressed by the authorities.
Efforts to further strengthen external debt management and its integration in the budget
formulation and expenditure management systems continue. In its June 2009 Medium-term Debt
Strategy, the government expressed its commitment to strengthening capacity. Also, it indicated
that during the 2009/10 financial year, both the domestic and external debt databases at the CBK
and Ministry of Finance will be linked through the fiber-optic cable network.

11
14.
To help address these issues, in 2006 a technical assistance mission recommended
introducing a foreign investment survey, enhancing the foreign exchange statistics survey,
and using a common methodology, including for estimations, in the use of available data in
the KNBS and CBK. In 2009, a DFID funded enterprise survey failed to materialize. There
are plans to conduct a foreign investment survey in 2010, which planned DFID-funded and
STA external sector missions will support.
15.

Kenya does not report international investment position statistics to STA.

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2009 Article IV Consultation with Kenya
On December, 22, 2009, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded
the Article IV consultation with Kenya.1
Background
Kenya’s strong economic performance during 2004–07 which resulted in an average of 6.0 percent
real GDP growth per annum stalled in 2008 due to a series of adverse developments, including the
global economic crisis. The combined impact of the shocks led Kenya to seek Fund financial
assistance under the Rapid Access Component of the Exogenous Shocks Facility (RAC-ESF) in
May 2009. A combination of policy adjustments and Fund financing of SDR135.7 million (about
US$207 million) were instrumental to improving macroeconomic performance and real growth in
2009/10 is now projected at 3.2 percent, up from 2.2 in 2008/09, despite prolonged drought and its
spillover effects.
Fiscal deficit in 2008/09 is estimated at 3.6 percent of GDP, falling short of the intended deficit of
5.9 per cent of GDP due to slow implementation of foreign funded development projects. While
preserving debt sustainability, the 2009/10 budget seeks to provide fiscal stimulus with a projected
fiscal deficit of 6 percent of GDP. Over the medium term and as growth gets entrenched, the fiscal

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On
return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the
Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the
Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the
country's authorities.

2
stimulus is expected to be gradually withdrawn and a convergence towards the target debt to GDP
ratio of 40 percent is projected.
Since 2008/09 monetary policy stance has been countercyclical. Central Bank of Kenya (CBK)
reduced the policy rate and the cash reserve requirement by a total of 125 and 150 basis points
respectively. However, the growth rate of monetary aggregates remained below target, and the
recently published revised CPI indicates that the inflation environment has been relatively benign.
The Financial Sector Assessment Program (FSAP) Update Mission, which preceded the Article IV
Mission, concluded that the banking sector remains well-capitalized and adequately provisioned.
However, it was found that increasing cross border transactions and regionalization would require
more sophisticated supervision and regulation. In the capital market, the mission found that poor
regulation and inadequate funding are key risks faced by the social security fund and other pension
schemes.
The current account deficit widened to 7.8 percent of GDP in 2008/09, compared to 4.5 percent the
previous year, reflecting the impact of various shocks. In 2009/10, a moderate narrowing of the
deficit, to around 7 percent is projected. The authorities have resumed build up of international
reserves, and gross official reserves stood at US$3.7 billion or some 3.7 months of imports at endOctober 2009.
Progress on the implementation of structural reforms is slow. The Governance Action Plan (GAP)
has been updated, but the Public Finance Management Bill, meant to address some weaknesses
in structural fiscal issues, and the Banking Act (Amendment) Bill, which is meant to strengthen the
hand of the CBK by authorizing consolidated supervision and prompt corrective action, are yet to
be brought before Parliament. Several other pieces of legislation designed to improve economic
governance have not been enacted.
Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors commended the Kenyan authorities for implementing sound macroeconomic
policies that are now contributing to a nascent recovery from the recent multiple adverse shocks.
Directors cautioned that, given that downside risks remain, it will be important to continue pursuing
sound economic policies in order to place the economy on a robust growth trajectory with debt
sustainability and low inflation.
Directors agreed that fiscal policy should strike the proper balance between providing economic
stimulus and preserving debt sustainability, noting that the 2009/10 budget is broadly appropriate
in providing needed stimulus. Directors generally supported contingency plans for the budget to
address possible revenue shortfalls. They welcomed the plan to gradually begin the withdrawal of
fiscal stimulus in the next budget year and supported strongly the convergence to the public debt
target over the medium term. Directors endorsed the introduction of an income support scheme
aimed at protecting the vulnerable and poor households.

3
Directors considered that easing monetary policy had been appropriate given the need to support
economic activity. Going forward, they generally recommended that monetary policy focus more
acutely on safeguarding price stability; and that available instruments should be employed
decisively to achieve this objective. Directors welcomed planned reforms to the monetary
operations framework, and recommended that policy objectives be communicated clearly. They
also welcomed the release of a revised CPI and plans to release a new series in early 2010, which
would enhance the effectiveness of monetary policy.
Directors observed that the managed float exchange rate regime has served Kenya well. They
noted staff’s assessment that the real effective exchange rate seems broadly in line with economic
fundamentals. Directors supported the authorities’ intention to limit foreign exchange interventions
to smoothing excessive short-term volatility and meeting the foreign reserve target.
Directors welcomed the assessment of the FSAP Update that the banking sector is well capitalized
and adequately provisioned. While the financial sector has weathered the immediate impact of the
global crisis, they concurred that risks remain. Directors commended the authorities for the
progress made in implementing the recommendations of the 2003 FSAP. They encouraged
expedited implementation of remaining recommendations to address emerging weaknesses
related to cross-border transactions and regionalization, and regulation of pension schemes. The
Central Bank of Kenya should ensure that provisions and capital buffers remain adequate to deal
with future risks.
Directors noted the authorities’ development strategy as laid out in their First Medium-Term Plan
under Kenya Vision 2030. They stressed accelerating broad-based structural and governance
reforms in order to improve the prospects for rapid economic growth over the medium term.
Directors recommended giving immediate priority to reforms of governance, public finance
management, and the financial sector. They commended the authorities for the recent passage of
the AML legislation, and called for speedy submission of remaining pending bills aimed at
consolidating the structural reform agenda. They also supported the authorities’ efforts to enhance
trade liberalization and strengthen the EAC regional integration framework.

Public Information Notices (PINs) form part of the IMF's efforts to promote transparency of
the IMF's views and analysis of economic developments and policies. With the consent of the
country (or countries) concerned, PINs are issued after Executive Board discussions of
Article IV consultations with member countries, of its surveillance of developments at the
regional level, of post-program monitoring, and of ex post assessments of member countries
with longer-term program engagements. PINs are also issued after Executive Board
discussions of general policy matters, unless otherwise decided by the Executive Board in a
particular case.
