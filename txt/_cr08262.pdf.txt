EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
The discussions took place around the 10th anniversary of EMU. Monetary union was widely
hailed as a success, while economic union was recognized to remain work in progress. The
rejection of the Lisbon Treaty in a country referendum has since dampened the mood.
•
How much reassurance can be drawn from past successes at the current juncture?
Over the past decade, inflation expectations have remained well anchored and employment
growth robust, notwithstanding large terms of trade shocks. The euro area has clearly become
more resilient, but it is not immune to the common global shocks. All official forecasts
expect demand to slow, albeit to somewhat different degrees, owing to high energy and food
prices, tighter financial conditions, slowing global activity, and the euro’s real effective
appreciation—to a level beyond that justified by medium-run fundamentals.
•
How should monetary policy react? The response hinges on how wages and inflation
expectations will evolve in the face of elevated energy and food prices, and whether the
economic slowdown forecast by all will exert a sufficiently dampening effect. While the
persistence of uncomfortably high headline inflation entails risks of second-round effects,
markets have already implemented appreciable tightening since summer 2007 and, in a still
strained financial environment, further tightening carries risks of its own. In this setting, the
case for a policy shift does not appear compelling, and staff sees value in keeping rates on
hold. For its part, the ECB––based also on a forecast of somewhat higher growth––sees
upside risks to price stability and is pointing to a possible need to raise rates.
•
What can be done to normalize markets? The ECB’s liquidity management
framework is viewed to have acted as a crucial stabilizer. Refinements remain under review.
The area’s financial system remains sound, although the outlook, as noted also in the ECB’s
most recent Financial Stability Review, remains highly uncertain. Addressing the issues
raised by the turmoil requires active implementation of the recommendations by the Financial
Stability Forum and others.
•
What is the right fiscal response? There is general satisfaction with the operation of
the SGP and the further fiscal adjustment recorded in 2007, though many countries continue
to fall well short of their medium-run commitments. The broadly shared view is that a policy
approach cast within the SGP serves countries best and that policies to protect vulnerable
groups should avoid distorting adjustment to higher energy prices.
•
For longer-term financial stability in the EU, the main question for member countries
is how to instill a greater sense of joint accountability and responsibility for EU-wide
stability, consistent with the aim of creating a single financial market. Important common
principles have been adopted that emphasize collective crisis cost minimization and burden
sharing. The challenge now is to fully align the legal underpinnings of national financial
stability frameworks with these commonly agreed principles.
•
For economic union, the main concern is how to address large intra-area
divergences. There is agreement that national reform programs need to place greater
emphasis on accelerating services market reform and financial integration. The European
Commission proposes enhancing internal surveillance.

4
I. CYCLICAL DEVELOPMENTS AND PROSPECTS
1.
Euro-area economic developments have contributed to global stability, but a
series of largely external shocks are now moving the economy away from external and
internal balance. The area’s external current account is still close to balance, fiscal policy
has generally been sound, and structural reforms are advancing, broadly in line with
commitments under the Fund’s Multilateral Consultations. But prospects have deteriorated.
2.
Following a strong showing in 2008Q1, real GDP growth is decelerating, in the
wake of several adverse economic shocks. Growth in 2008Q1 was much higher than
projected, reflecting a remarkably strong performance of the German economy––which, to an
appreciable extent, was driven by special factors––but also greater robustness elsewhere.

Box 1. Spillovers Between the Euro Area and the United States
This box summarizes the estimation results from a VAR and a generalized dynamic factor model for
the size of the spillovers and the strength of the trade and the financial sector channels through which
shocks between the euro area and the United States are transmitted (Figure 5).
The estimation results suggest that the degree of co-movement in activity and the financial sector
between the two regions is high and has increased over time. In particular:
• The slowdowns in growth are highly synchronized—all significant US downturns have either
coincided with or been followed by sharp slowdowns in the euro area.
• The spillovers seem large; on average a one percentage point decline in US real GDP growth
shaves off ¼ percentage point of euro area growth within two quarters, with a maximum impact of
close to ½ percentage point after one year. However, since the size of spillovers differs from case to
case, these estimates cannot be applied mechanically.
• The cycles in the euro area and the
United States have been largely and
increasingly driven by common shocks. In
particular, the share of euro-area real GDP
growth explained by common shocks
increased from 37 percent in 1980–1993 to
54 percent during 1994–2007.
Both trade and financial transmission
channels have become stronger over time,
with the trade channel likely playing mainly
via third country effects.

Against this backdrop, discussions focused on the degree of resilience of the euro-area
economy, which has been stronger than expected thus far, with past reforms having made for
greater labor market robustness and more job-friendly wage setting.

currently some 15 percent higher than its
1993–2006 average, having appreciated by about 10 percent since end-2006, carrying the
euro beyond its medium-run fundamentals—in a measure of at least 10 percent according to

6
staff estimates (Box 2). The effect of this appreciation depends on its source––staff estimates
that it might shave off at least ¼ percent from real GDP growth over the near term. EC
representatives underscored that its adverse effects would grow the longer it lasted, as
currency hedges expire, wages accelerate from the unusually low growth rates observed
during 2003–05, and production is adapted to lower profitability. There is also some concern
that the reaction to currency appreciation may be non-linear, becoming abruptly more intense
beyond a difficult-to-pinpoint threshold.
Box 2. Assessing the External Competitiveness of the Euro Area
The latest appreciation leaves the euro on the strong side relative to fundamentals. The projected
medium-run current account deficit stands at about ¾ percent of GDP, while real exchange rate
models put the equilibrium at a surplus of 0.2 percent of GDP.* Based on the latest exchange
rates, CGER estimates place the euro’s overvaluation in a range of
5–20 percent. However, staff considers the equilibrium real exchange rate (ERER) estimate too
high since the commodity terms of trade used in the standard ERER calculation tend to overstate
the degree of terms of trade deterioration for the euro area over the past several years, as
suggested by recovering export margins since the dip in mid-2004 (Figure 6). By the same
token, however, the trade elasticities with respect to the exchange rate might also be lower than
implicit in the macroeconomic balance and external sustainability approaches. All in all, staff
sees the real effective exchange rate of the euro at least 10 percent stronger than warranted by
medium-run fundamentals.

EC and ECB representatives broadly agreed with staff’s assessment. They underscored their

multilateral consultations (Table 5).

spots” could, via financial linkages, trigger a broader
decline in other euro-area countries. However, EC and ECB representatives underscored that

7
the effects on growth for the area as a whole would be contained. The limited amount of nonprime lending, relatively low loan-to-value ratios, and few opportunities for equity
withdrawal would limit the scope for pernicious feedback loops between the housing and
financial sectors as well as the broader real economy. Staff agrees and sees adjustment in this
sector making for important medium-run headwinds, after providing noticeable support over
the past decade.
5.
Balance sheets outside the financial sector still seem relatively robust, which
should support activity (Figure 7). Balance sheets of corporations are stronger than at the
onset of the last credit cycle downturn and there is scant evidence of a significant investment
overhang. However, European businesses are relatively dependent on bank lending and are
more leveraged than their US peers, which makes investment vulnerable to the ongoing
tightening of credit. Amid tougher financing conditions and cost pressures, default rates are
expected to rise from their recent historically low levels, with highly-leveraged corporations
and real-estate related businesses being particularly vulnerable. Household leverage has been
rising but generally remains appreciably lower than in the United States or the United
Kingdom, while personal savings––at some 14 percent of household income––are much
higher. Pockets of vulnerability exist among households in countries that have seen rapid
house price appreciation, in particular where variable-rate mortgages are common.

environment has become much more adverse. Funding costs have increased considerably,
particularly for lower-rated banks, and balance sheet constraints have tightened as several
market segments closed down (Figures 8 & 9). Interbank markets have dried up at longer

8
maturities and spreads have risen as banks started hoarding liquidity amid mounting concerns
about running into liquidity constraints, and the need to bring off-balance sheet exposures
back on balance sheet. Loan losses have started to increase. In this context, banks have
retrenched from risk-taking and significantly tightened lending standards. The ECB sees the
outlook for financial stability as depending on three factors: developments in asset markets—
notably in the US and other housing markets—and in the broader economy; the way banks
respond to their more challenging operating environment; and the extent to which initiatives
and measures aimed at restoring confidence and strengthening financial system resilience are
eventually implemented.
7.
Household credit has slowed significantly and credit to non-financial
corporations, which has shown buoyant growth thus far, is generally expected to follow.
ECB staff viewed lending to households behaving in line with normalizing conditions in
euro-area housing markets. Bank lending to euro-area non-financial corporations has, in
contrast, continued to expand, seemingly unimpaired thus far by the financial turmoil
(Figure 10). 2 However, credit standards reported in the euro-area bank lending survey point
to an appreciable tightening of conditions (Figure 11). Unlike in recent episodes, the expected
tightening of bank credit would probably not be offset by an increased availability of bond
and equity financing. Staff analysis suggests that tightening financial conditions tend to have
a significant impact on credit with a noticeable lag (Box 3). ECB representatives agreed that
corporate credit growth would likely slow.
8.
However, absent further shocks, supply-side effects from the financial sector on
activity were reckoned to be manageable (Box 3). Market-based indicators of vulnerability
have stabilized. EC and ECB representatives thought that good progress had been made with
respect to loan loss recognition and recapitalization but felt that it was too early to conclude
that the worst was over, considering also that many banks still have to release results. In this
regard, the ECB noted lingering uncertainty about the possibility of further large losses
disclosed over the next few quarters, with the adjustment process likely to be protracted. Still,
in their view, the bulk of the euro area’s many banks would not be directly affected by the
subprime turmoil, offering some reassurance. Furthermore, it was noted that the losses
disclosed by financial institutions have so far largely reflected mark-to-market write-downs
on hard-to-value assets, with the related possibility that the credit loss outturns may
ultimately prove less severe. The common view thus was that the shutdown of various
wholesale market segments and rising risk premia would restrain credit but that an outright
credit crunch would be avoided.
9.
Substantial uncertainty is associated with spillover risks between the euro area
and emerging Europe, but growth in emerging Europe would still support euro-area
exports. The real and financial linkages between the euro area and emerging Europe have
become much stronger in recent years.3 The convergence trend of emerging Europe is

ECB analysis does not point to major re-intermediation effects.

For example, econometric models suggest that the accelerated growth in emerging Europe in the past five years
and the increased share of the euro area have contributed 0.2–0.4 percentage points to euro area annual growth
(Regional Economic Outlook: Europe, November 2007).

9
projected to continue, albeit at a slower pace, as growth rates in recent years have been above
estimates of potential for most countries and an adjustment is already under way. The risks to
this scenario are considerable, since the emerging European economies, partly due to their
openness, are more vulnerable to a global slowdown than those of the euro area, 4 and these
vulnerabilities could be amplified through financial channels. However, so far spillovers
from euro area financial and real sector developments to emerging Europe have been limited.
Hence, the central scenario underlying IMF/EC/ECB projections is for a
significant slowdown, but no recession or prolonged period of sluggish activity, such as
during 2002–05. Staff projections foresee

Based on these estimates, the

Alternatively, combining these estimates
with April 2008 GFSR data on estimated
losses in large euro area banks yields a
-0.2 percentage point impact on output. EC
work suggests similar numbers. These effects
may be larger if banks are subjected to more
shocks or if losses in non-euro area banks
have an appreciable euro-area impact (euroarea banks account for only 37 percent of the
“European bank” losses in the GFSR, the rest
being accounted for mostly by Swiss and

decline observed in July 2007–May
2008) can be associated with a
3 percentage point reduction in real
credit growth. The analysis also shows
that, in turn, a 1 percentage point
decrease in bank loan supply
corresponds to a 0.1 percentage point
decline in real GDP in the euro area.

Sources: Staff calculations based on data from Datastream. Note:
Distance to default is the difference between the expected value of
assets at maturity and the default threshold, which is a function of
the value of the liabilities. A higher distance to default is associated
with a lower probability of default.

• Data for labor compensation in 2008Q1 suggest that wage hikes have reached the
relatively higher 2000–03 range, with settlements in industry and construction pulling ahead.
But with below potential output growth through 2009, staff projects that any further
acceleration will remain contained. The Commission forecast is similar, with unit labor cost
growth settling below 2 percent in 2009. While neither the EC nor ECB staff projections
assume broad-based second-round effects, their representatives stressed the acceleration in
labor compensation during 2007––with negotiated wages increasing 2.8 percent according to
2008Q1 data, up from 2.2 percent in 2007––and saw rising risks. Staff derives more
reassurance from the past performance of the labor market: these wage increases are not out
of line with projections and, usually, labor markets tend to peak after the cycle has turned.
13.
The inflation outlook is widely considered highly uncertain, with ECB
representatives seeing the risks clearly on the upside. Energy and food prices have been
surprising on the upside repeatedly and headline inflation is hovering at levels that are the
highest in a decade. There is also a risk that the effect of the ongoing catch-up of wages in
Germany is not sufficiently countered by moderating wage growth in other parts of the area,
or that it is even emulated. Both EC and ECB representatives stressed the upside risks related
to second-round effects on account of inflation overshooting the 2 percent target for many
months, pointing to the threat presented by wage indexation schemes in a number of

12
euro-area member countries. Staff viewed the related risks as relatively contained given the
details of most of the indexation schemes in question and argued that downside risks to
inflation become more relevant beyond the near term. There was agreement that these risks
relate to a greater-than-projected weakening of activity, further euro appreciation, and a
reversal of commodity prices, to the extent speculative forces have been at play. 5 But all of
the mission’s interlocutors––except the employers and trade unions––saw upside risks
prevailing.
Financial conditions have tightened considerably

14.
Amid robust money and credit growth,
the ECB has kept rates on hold thus far. 6 The
ECB has been drawing attention to “continuing
very vigorous money and credit growth and the
absence of significant constraints on bank loan
supply up to now” (Figure 13). In its view, robust
underlying monetary expansion continues to point
to upside risks to price stability over the medium to
longer term. Staff attaches less importance to
monetary aggregates in assessing inflation
prospects (¶17).

15.
The discussions focused on how to
balance the immediate upside risks to price
stability from high commodity and food prices
with the downside pressures stemming from weakening activity going forward.
Financial conditions have tightened appreciably since the summer of 2007: 12-month
interbank rates are up 1 percentage point, reaching 5½ percent––a level last attained in the
mid-1990s; risk premia have widened by 50–200bp; and the real effective exchange rate has
appreciated by some 5 percent. At the same time, economic prospects have worsened. The
question is whether policy tightening is needed to keep inflation expectations well-anchored
and move inflation to below 2 percent over the medium run. ECB representatives have
recently suggested that this may be the case, underscoring that the situation requires “a state
of heightened alertness” and leading markets to price in a 25bp hike in July, with a small
probability of another 25bp move by end-year (Figure 14). For its part, staff does not see a
compelling case for further tightening. First, central projections of EC, ECB, and IMF staff
foresee real GDP growth slowing to below potential, with inflation declining appreciably, at
least to very close to 2.0 percent by end-2009 (or less in the case of IMF staff). Second, all
market-relevant interest rates––the exceptions are ECB policy rates and government bond
yields––are already noticeably above “neutral”, which staff estimates in a broad range
centered around 4–4½ percent. Thus, there is already a good deal of insurance against upside
risks to price stability in the system. And third, tightening in the face of a still uncertain
5

Rules of thumb suggest that a 10 percent real effective appreciation of the euro reduces prices by
0.5 percentage points in two years, while 10 percent permanent decline of oil prices reduces inflation by
0.1 percentage points in a year.

13
outlook for financial stability carries its own risks. Accordingly, staff considers that rates
should stay on hold. Tightening, however, would be appropriate if, contrary to prevailing
projections, forward-looking indicators no longer pointed to significantly growing slack, or
wage settlements for 2009 hinted at accelerating labor costs.
16.
Regarding the monetary policy framework, ECB representatives stressed the
usefulness of the two-pillar approach to monetary policy. The motivation for the
monetary analysis, which complements economic analysis, is that the ECB sees “the more
drawn-out and persistent trends in inflation” to be “empirically closely associated with the
medium-term trend growth of money.” There is, therefore, in the ECB’s view, a need to
explicitly take information from monetary developments, which might otherwise risk being
overlooked or underestimated, into due account in policy considerations. As an example,
ECB representatives mentioned the hike in interest rates in December 2005, which hinged
crucially on the upside risks to price stability identified by the monetary analysis. Currently,
ECB work is geared toward further refining its monetary analysis with a view to gaining a
better understanding of financial sector and asset price developments and their relations to
economic growth and inflation.
17.
Staff welcomed the work on broadening monetary analysis but saw room for
clarifying the relative role of monetary aggregates in the presentation of monetary
policy decisions. Monetary analysis has proven useful in understanding the recent financial
turmoil––shedding light, for example, on the issue of re-intermediation––and its possible
impact on economic growth. However, while monetary analysis has some value for gauging
inflationary pressure over the policy-relevant medium run, this is limited (particularly in
recent years) and not independent of non-monetary factors. 7 As a result, staff considers that
the signals from the analysis of monetary aggregates are overemphasized in the presentation
of monetary policy decisions. The fruits of the work on broadening monetary analysis, aside
from bringing new medium- to longer-run considerations to bear on monetary policy
(e.g., asset prices), could therefore usefully lead to a presentation of policy decisions that
unifies economic and monetary analysis and that provides a clearer narrative of the relative
role of monetary aggregates in influencing the policy stance.
III. LIQUIDITY MANAGEMENT
18.
The ECB has taken a number of initiatives to ease tensions in money markets.
The ECB’s broad list of eligible collateral and counterparties—other central banks have since
moved in this direction—proved a significant advantage from the start of the turmoil;
relatively high but flexible reserve requirements have provided a useful buffer to banks; and
the ECB’s toolkit allows significant scope for adapting its operations to the needs of the
market. The ECB conducted fine-tuning operations, increased the share of liquidity provided

through its three-month refinancing operations, and introduced six-month operations. 8 As a
result, the maturity of refinancing operations has increased significantly, although there has
been no net injection of liquidity over the respective reserve maintenance periods.

transactions. Similarly, the collateral received remains under continuous assessment, to
ensure it meets the Eurosystem’s risk tolerance level and that the rules outlined in the
collateral framework are strictly applied. In this context it was also noted that the possibility
for banks to use as collateral asset-backed securities that they have originated themselves
likely helped prevent a complete shut down of primary markets in the medium term.
However, this could not be an alternative to the restoration of a deep and orderly functioning
market offering true secured funding possibilities and thus the ECB stood ready to review
this practice if necessary to restart markets. Staff also noted that, to limit moral hazard,
liquidity management at the systemic level should be accompanied by a more rules-based
approach to managing stress at the individual bank level (¶29). Longer-term, further
integrating and developing secured interbank markets—via further progress in current efforts
to integrate clearing and settlement systems––could reduce the risk and impact of similar
stress.

Also, currency swap lines have been established with the Federal Reserve to facilitate the provision of U.S.
dollar liquidity in euro area markets.

15
IV. FISCAL POLICY
20.
The fiscal position of the euro area improved in 2007 and now compares
favorably to that in other parts of the world, marking a success for the reformed
Stability and Growth Pact (SGP). In structural terms, the fiscal accounts of the euro area as
a whole reached a close-to-balanced position (Figure 15). All excessive deficit procedures
vis-à-vis euro-area countries have been closed, and about half of the countries reached or
exceeded their “close to balance or surplus” medium-term objectives (MTO). Concurrently,
the general government debt ratio continued to fall.
21.
However, a number of countries still face appreciable fiscal challenges, partly as
a result of insufficient adjustment during the upswing. Countries that have not reached
their MTO include almost all those with high public debt. This is troubling, as population
aging-related outlays are set to accelerate soon after 2010 and add some 3¾–5 percent of
GDP to public expenditure by 2050. Also, the structural balance for 2007 may well turn out
to be lower than presently estimated to the extent that tax elasticities have been procyclical;
and overall stimulus in 2008 could turn out somewhat larger than the modest boost planned
thus far (largely by relatively well-positioned countries), given pressures for measures to
support citizens’ purchasing power in the face of ever higher commodity prices. Staff argued
that tax policy should not be used to limit the pass-through of rising energy prices. At the
June ECOFIN, Ministers reiterated their Manchester commitment of 2005 to avoid policies
that prevent adjustment; regarding energy and food price-related challenges facing poorer
segments of the population, the commitment calls for interventions to remain short-term,
targeted, and non-distortionary. 10 More recently, though, interpretations of this commitment
appear to be varying across countries
22.
Some countries’ fiscal deficits risk exceeding the Maastricht limit over the near
term, potentially testing the reformed Pact’s excessive deficit procedure. The
Commission has issued a fiscal policy advice to France, calling for strengthening the pace of
budgetary consolidation so as to ensure that a suitable safety margin against breaching the
3 percent of GDP deficit threshold is soon attained. 11 Under EC and staff forecasts, other
countries’ safety margins (e.g., Italy, Portugal) also risk being rather narrow.
23.
There was broad agreement that the SGP rules provided the appropriate
compass for fiscal policy in dealing with the current downturn. Accordingly, automatic
stabilizers should be allowed to play freely, except in countries where this might lead to
breaches of the Maastricht reference value. Countries that have reached their MTOs could
consider additional discretionary loosening, but others need to continue to adjust at a pace of
at least ½ percent of GDP per annum, unless in “bad times” (as defined under the revised
SGP). Several considerations support this approach: (i) a more activist stance would
undermine the many benefits of countries’ gradual moves toward a more rules-based fiscal

policy; (ii) medium-run fiscal adjustment plans in Stability Programs still need to be backed
up with measures; (iii) fiscal space needs to be preserved for higher aging-related outlays in
the future; (iv) the implementation of fiscal actions that are high-quality, timely, temporary,
and well-targeted faces high political economy hurdles in many countries; and (v) stimulus
may lead to a further widening of government bond spreads in some countries while running
counter to real exchange rate desiderata.
24.
The country authorities reiterated their support for the SGP. Last year’s
commitment to reach MTO by 2010 had been made on the understanding that “good times”
prevailed, notwithstanding negative output gaps in parts of the area. Ministers were generally
intent on sticking with this objective, notwithstanding deteriorated cyclical prospects. For
their part, Italy and France aim to attain their MTOs in 2011 and 2012, respectively. In
virtually all countries, reaching these objectives will require the adoption of measures that
have yet to be specified in Stability Programs.
V. INTEGRATING EUROPE’S FINANCIAL SECTOR
25.
The EU’s financial stability framework is being reformed. The core issue is that
national authorities’ fiduciary responsibilities are toward national governments and
parliaments, limiting the incentives to work toward a common EU-wide stability framework,
which is essential for full financial integration. 12 Growing recognition of the limitations of the
existing arrangements and their tensions with financial integration, combined with the
impetus provided by the financial turmoil, has forged a convergence of views in favor of
reform. Staff has for some time been arguing for more information sharing; better crisis
prevention, management, and resolution frameworks, including at national levels; and greater
joint accountability and responsibility for EU-wide financial stability.
26.
New policy principles and a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) ask member
states to look beyond national borders when managing and resolving crises. 13 The MoU
commits member states to act in crises in ways that minimize the “potential harmful
economic impacts at the lowest overall collective costs.” If public resources are needed to
achieve a cost-minimizing solution to a crisis, then “direct budgetary net costs are shared
among Member States on the basis of equitable and balanced criteria.” The formal
recognition of a collective responsibility and of cost-sharing is an innovative step forward.
However, it is widely recognized that tensions between national interests in times of severe
crises would probably not be resolved via a non-binding MoU. Furthermore, staff noted its
concern––shared by others––that the MoU risked adding a large number of bilateral,
trilateral, etc. committees to an already complex supervisory cross-border set-up, rather than

17
taking a true multilateral approach, which would also facilitate international coordination. 14
The MoU is to be tested with a crisis simulation exercise in 2009.
27.
Efforts are also underway to accelerate financial integration. EU Directives
typically provide considerable latitude for country-specific regulatory and supervisory
policies and practices. It is now recognized that such broad latitude creates unnecessary costs
for financial market participants and may hinder the completion of the single market. The
current reform program seeks to reinforce the EU Committees of Supervisors (Lamfalussy
level 3 committees––CEBS, CESR, CEIOPS)––which have been set up with a view to
fostering regulatory and supervisory convergence––by giving them more resources,
introducing scope for qualified majority voting, and strengthening the national application of
the “Level 3 guidelines”, while keeping their non-binding nature (“comply or explain”). In
addition, the May ECOFIN called on member states to endow their supervisors’ statutes with
a European mandate so that they “are able to take into account the EU dimension in the
performance of their duties, including having regard to the financial stability concerns in
other Member States in exercising their duties.”
28.
Moreover, a number of initiatives are underway to strengthen specific elements
of the EU financial stability framework, including in response to the latest turmoil.
These include developing proposals to speed up work on the convergence of regulatory and
financial reporting; improve Deposit Guarantee Schemes and, relatedly, allow for authorities
to apply early intervention and reorganization measures to cross-border groups; and assess
the obstacles to asset transferability that could hinder crisis management of cross-border
groups, with a view to forestalling counter-productive ring-fencing of assets, and facilitating
smooth crisis management. The response to the latest turmoil––on which the European
institutions are working with international standard setters––covers four areas: enhancing
transparency; improving valuation of financial products; strengthening prudential
requirements; and making markets function better. 15 Priorities include introducing
international standards for liquidity regulation; reducing incentives for regulatory arbitrage,
off-balance sheet exposures, and exposure concentration; and strengthening the oversight of
credit rating agencies.
29.
The mission welcomed the ongoing efforts and pressed for legal and practical
steps to effectively implement the agreed policy principles. In the wake of the financial
turmoil, the political will should be found to make rapid progress in several areas:

14

Specifically, under the MoU countries that share a single or several financial groups are to conclude
non-legally binding Voluntary Specific Cooperation Agreements for shared financial groups, which are to
provide for “specific and detailed crisis management procedures”, including the establishment of “Cross-Border
Stability Groups” (CBSG) that build on “Domestic Standing Groups” (DSG) as well as existing “colleges of
supervisors” (CS). These will operate alongside the level 3 Committees (CEBS, CESR, CEIOPS), the European
System of Central Banks (ESCB), and the Financial Services Committee of EU Finance Ministries.

Box 4. A “European Mandate” for Financial Sector Supervisors *
Tendencies towards economic nationalism in financial sector regulation and supervision could
in principle be countered if regulators and supervisors were mandated to take into account
common European interests. The mission discussed proposals for a European mandate, bearing
in mind several issues:
• The European mandate should be formulated in such a way as to focus on financial
sector stability and efficiency. It could state an overall objective, followed by a more specific
list of “dos and don’ts” (e.g., do work toward integrating EU financial markets; don’t take
unilateral actions with adverse spillovers on other EU countries).
• At a minimum, member institutions of the so-called Level 3 Lamfalussy Committees
(i.e., supervisors and regulators) as well as the Committees themselves should be covered.
• The mandate should preferably have the force of law and have precedence in case of
conflict with national mandates. Voluntary mechanisms can help implement a European
mandate during normal times, but may seize up in stress situations.
•

Accountability must match the mandate. The EU Commission (with assistance of the
Lamfalussy Committees) would be competent to review observance of a European mandate
enshrined in an EU legal instrument. The private sector should also be empowered to assess
whether authorities are fulfilling their mandates, and to challenge those that are not.
* For further details, see Selected Issues, Chapter IV, and the forthcoming IMF Working Paper “A
European Mandate for Financial Sector Authorities in the EU”, by Daniel Hardy.

•
While integration is much higher now than before EMU, the euro area is still
experiencing large internal imbalances. 16 To a significant extent, these are adjustment
dynamics that reflect convergence from different starting points and progressing integration
following the introduction of a single currency; they will take time to work out in full.
However, countries’ imbalances also reflect important remaining structural differences and,
in the current environment, constitute a source of vulnerability.
31.
The Lisbon Agenda is seen to offer a shared vehicle to address intra-area
divergences but countries’ reform programs need to be reoriented in a coordinated
manner. Staff and the Commission concurred that National Reform Programs (NRP) under
the Lisbon Agenda need to focus more on making the single market a reality, particularly by
opening up national services markets––including for financial services––to competition from
EU partners. Tellingly, productivity growth has been particularly sluggish in services and
differences in services price inflation account for a large part of inflation and competitiveness
divergences. Progress in this direction is also consistent with the area’s commitments under
the Fund’s Multilateral Consultations (Table 5). The Commission also underscored that
financial market reforms could facilitate other structural reforms by helping advance their
payoffs. Moreover, reforms need to focus on facilitating labor market adjustment in response
to shocks, even if much progress has been made in this respect since the mid-1990s.

16

Adjustment Channels, and Policy Implications.

20
32.
The Commission saw a clear need to broaden and deepen intra-area surveillance
to address internal macroeconomic imbalances. 17 Spillovers and interdependencies meant
that current account and competitiveness divergences represent a concern not just for the
country in question but for the euro area as a whole––the same reasoning applied to euro-area
candidate countries, notably those already in ERM-2. The Commission also thought that
more could be done with existing surveillance instruments to strengthen the incentives to
pursue reforms that foster internal adjustment. To that effect, it inter alia proposes
establishing a peer review mechanism based on the analytical framework developed under the
Lisbon Strategy to take account of fiscally costly but adjustment-friendly structural reforms
when implementing the SGP. Lastly, the Commission highlighted the need to enhance the
euro area’s international role, by developing common positions and by consolidating its
representation, ultimately leading to a single seat in relevant international financial
institutions and fora.
33.
Staff supported the objective of improving internal surveillance but stressed the
risks related to allowing for a trade-off between fiscal adjustment under the SGP and
structural reforms. Fiscal adjustment and structural reforms are often complements:
successful reform countries have typically progressed on both fronts at the same time. 18
Moreover, such a trade-off would be difficult to implement objectively. This could
undermine the benefits of a rules-based fiscal framework, including greater predictability of
fiscal policy, as well as peer pressure to respect the SGP. The Commission was confident that
these problems could be avoided, provided a rigorous monitoring framework is put in place.
VII. TRADE POLICY AND FOOD PRICES
34.
The EU continues to seek to conclude on the substance of a Doha Round
agreement before the end of 2008. Commission representatives were of the view that
significant progress is being made with respect to agricultural products and were cautiously
hopeful that a broad agreement on Doha could be reached this year. In its bilateral trade
relations, the EU has entered into interim or final economic partnership agreements with
more than thirty African, Caribbean, and Pacific (ACP) countries in the last several months
and will seek more final agreements with these and other ACP countries in the coming year.
These are intended to be WTO-consistent free trade agreements (FTAs) to replace the
Cotonou preferences for the ACP countries. While it attaches top priority to multilateral trade
liberalization, the EU is also pursuing FTA negotiations with India, Korea, and the ASEAN
and Mercosur countries, and is negotiating international investment agreements on behalf of
the member states.
35.
The Commission has launched various initiatives to address the challenges posed
by rising food prices. Its strategy is to help developing countries cope through targeted
development aid; ensure that market incentives are in place for a supply response to develop;
and discourage export taxes and other barriers to international trade. The EU has taken

various measures, notably suspending the “set-aside” for 2008–09, which should increase its
cultivated farmland by about 10 percent. The Commission is of the view that the reformed
Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) offers the appropriate incentives to trigger a supply
response to the high food prices from European farmers, contributing to a good harvest in
2008. A “health check” of the CAP will be conducted next year, and will include
consideration of abolishing the “set-aside” as well as further efforts to reduce supply
restrictions. The EU’s policies on biofuels––the production of which consumes a small but
growing fraction of grains––are being kept under review.
VIII. STAFF APPRAISAL
36.
Ten years after its launch, monetary union is a distinct and promising success.
EMU’s macroeconomic policy framework has brought stability, both inside and outside the
euro area, and the union has been expanding, with Slovakia set to become its newest member.
In particular, despite major terms of trade shocks, labor costs have been subdued and
employment growth remarkably strong over the past decade. The relative protection offered
by EMU must, however, not detract from the effort of building a vibrant economic union to
realize monetary union’s full potential. Notwithstanding important achievements, this
remains work in progress.
37.
Conjuncturally, the 10th anniversary of EMU witnessed the euro-area economy
being strained by a combination of decelerating activity and uncomfortably high
inflation. High commodity and food prices, tighter financial conditions, weakening real
estate markets, and slowing external demand are buffeting the economy, as is the
appreciation of the real effective exchange rate of the euro, which is now on the strong side of
medium-run fundamentals. As a result, growth will likely slow substantially in the coming
quarters, before reaccelerating toward trend in 2009 as the effects of the various shocks
unwind. However, the uncertainties around this baseline projection are large.
38.
Monetary policy has to balance the risk of a broad-based increase in inflation
with the prospect of gradually building disinflationary forces generated by the
economic slowdown. Much now hinges on how labor costs and inflation expectations
evolve. As the economy slows, reduced demand for labor and pressure on employers’
margins should act as restraining forces. Assuming stabilizing commodity and food prices,
inflation should thus recede appreciably in 2009—as reflected in official forecasts. The
uncertainties around the outlook for inflation are exceptionally large, and while the durable
improvements achieved under EMU in the functioning of labor markets and in anchoring
inflation expectations provide some reassurance, risks of second-round effects remain. As do,
conversely, the risks that could stem—in an already strained financial environment—from a
further tightening of financial conditions, beyond that observed since summer 2007, when
economic prospects were distinctly brighter. In this setting, a case for tightening would
nonetheless arise if, contrary to prevailing projections, forward-looking indicators no longer
pointed to significantly widening slack or 2009 wage settlements hinted at accelerating labor
costs, raising the risk of rising inflation expectations. In the absence of such signals, however,
policy rates are best kept on hold.

22
39.
Further development of the ECB’s monetary analysis would help strengthen an
already solid policy framework. The ongoing efforts to broaden the analysis of the
determinants of inflation, including financial market and asset price developments, are
welcome. This work could usefully lead to a unified presentation of policy decisions that
integrates monetary and economic analysis, thereby providing a clearer portrayal of the
relative role of monetary aggregates in influencing the policy stance.
40.
The ECB’s liquidity management has been timely and proactive and its
framework—while possibly subject to refinements—has proven flexible and robust. The
broad lists of eligible collateral and counterparties and relatively high but flexible reserve
requirements have acted as helpful stabilizers from the very start of the turmoil. Nonetheless,
banks’ balance-sheet stresses and fears of liquidity shortages are likely to keep interbank term
spreads high for some time. The ECB is appropriately keeping its operational framework
under continuous review, assessing carefully the collateral it receives and ensuring that the
framework’s rules are strictly applied. Longer-term, further developing secured interbank
markets could reduce the risk and impact of similar stress, underscoring the urgency of
integrating clearing and settlement systems.
41.
Political leadership and a strong multilateral spirit will be needed to move
decisively toward the greater joint responsibility and accountability for EU financial
stability implied in recent ECOFIN decisions. The agreed principles for cross-border crisis
management are mould-breaking. The key challenge now is to fully align the legal
underpinnings of nationally-anchored financial stability frameworks with the commonly
agreed principles. The recent Memorandum of Understanding on crisis management and the
intention to strengthen the Level-3 Committees of Supervisors are significant steps forward,
but should be complemented by more binding arrangements. In this regard, the planned
introduction of a European dimension in the mandates of national supervisory authorities
should clearly rule out “beggar-thy-neighbor”-type policies and provide appropriate
accountability. Also, a multilateral platform for real-time sharing of systemically-relevant
supervisory information among supervisors and central banks, including the ECB, is urgently
needed. Medium term, firmer arrangements are needed to underpin the principles of
collective crisis cost minimization and sharing of fiscal costs based on equitable and balanced
criteria. All these steps will require strong political leadership––in many ways akin to that
leading to the creation of the common currency––in a multilateral approach that would also
facilitate collaboration with non-EU countries, which is essential in a globalized financial
system with large cross-border financial institutions.
42.
A rules-based fiscal policy serves countries best, notably in today’s uncertain
environment. The SGP has improved fiscal discipline, although about half of the euro area
countries still face persistent challenges in meeting its objectives. Given growing expenditure
pressures from catering to aging populations and the risk of unanticipatedly large cyclicality
in fiscal fortunes, the room for policy adjustment in response to the current downturn must be
a function of the leeway allowed by the SGP. Furthermore, tax policy should not be used to
hamper adjustment to rising energy and food prices. Looking further ahead, stronger national
fiscal rules and domestic governance mechanisms could help achieve more predictable and
efficient fiscal policies in countries that struggle with relatively high public deficits and debt.

23
43.
The structural reform momentum needs to be kept up and re-oriented in a
coordinated manner to improve adjustment in response to intra-area disparities and
make further progress on commitments under the Fund’s Multilateral Consultations.
The ongoing reforms are bearing fruit, contributing to the marked growth in employment and
to improved productivity in liberalized sectors. However, large parts of the services sector
remain unaffected, forfeiting important income, resilience, and inflation benefits.
Accordingly, the reform recommendations under the Lisbon Agenda for the euro area as a
whole appropriately emphasize accelerating services market reform and financial integration.
Greater consistency of National Reform Programs with these euro-area recommendations is
needed, requiring enhanced policy coordination.
44.
Prompt action is needed to conclude the Doha Round and bolster multilateral
liberalization. The right response to high food prices is to lower agricultural trade barriers
and subsidies so as to foster the production and free trade of agricultural products.
Approaches that emphasize self-sufficiency with respect to food production should therefore
be resisted and biofuels policies kept under review. EU leadership in facilitating an ambitious
and balanced conclusion to the Doha Round can provide a critical counterweight to rising
protectionist pressures.
45.
It is proposed that the next consultation on euro-area policies in the context of the
Article IV obligations of member countries follow the standard 12-month cycle.

Progress Made
Limited progress so far; some initiatives in the pipeline.
The deadline for transposing the Services Directive at the national level is 17 months away. The Commission has published an implementation
handbook. Countries are proceeding with preparatory work. It will be important to track their interim progress to ensure full and timely implementation.
In network services, progress in deregulation has been limited to few euro area countries: rail (the Netherlands), energy (Spain, Netherlands), telecom
(Finland, Greece, Slovenia). In February, the German utility company E.ON offered to sell its electricity grid, which may be a breakthrough.
In retail services, progress has also been limited, even though some measures have been taken (Spain, Italy) or are expected (France).
In professional services, although measures have been taken in some countries (Spain, Belgium, Finland, Italy, the Netherlands), the situation has not
significantly improved, and competition remains insufficient in a number of countries. Reform initiatives are on the table in France and Italy.
Several initiatives have been proposed by the European Commission to create a more level playing field in network industries (a new postal directive, to
remove the outstanding “reserved segments”; creating a European Telecom Market Authority, and a package of legislative proposals in the energy
sectors, aimed at achieving an effective separation of supply and transmission activities).
More progress in some areas and countries than others.
Regarding increasing fiscal incentives to work and further adjusting benefits systems, progress has been made in several countries: active labor market
policies have been strengthened (Austria, Belgium) and social security systems improved (Belgium, Germany). The reform package in France contains
a number of elements in these areas. In Germany, however, there have been some reform reversals (e.g., higher minimum wage for postal workers,
longer unemployment benefit period for older workers).
In fostering flexibility and security in the labor market, some countries have moved toward an integrated flexicurity approach (Austria, Finland, Ireland,
the Netherlands), while others are taking steps in that broad direction (France, Italy).
To better align wage and productivity developments, some countries have moved gradually toward more wage and working time flexibility. For example,
there are signs that wage bargaining has become more decentralized in some countries (Austria, Spain, Finland, Italy). The reform package in France
also contains measures in this area (e.g., making the 35-hour workweek less binding).
Regarding promoting labor mobility between countries and occupations, this area has been the focus of recent EU initiatives, such as the
recommendations on European Qualifications Framework and the European Job Mobility Action Plan. On the country level, however, progress on
cross-border mobility has generally been limited, with some exceptions.
Progress has been more pronounced.
The Payment Services Directive was published in the EU Journal and has to be transposed at the national level by November 2009.
The Markets in Financial Instruments Directive (MiFID) became effective in November 2007. Some non-euro area countries have yet to transpose it.
Target 2 replaced Target as a platform for payments in November 2007. The development of the Target2 Securities project is proceeding, with a final
report to the Governing Council to be presented in summer 2008.
Implementation of the Financial Services Action Plan at the national level is close to completion. In addition to MiFID, several countries have yet to
transpose the Transparency Directive. Regarding financial stability arrangements, recent steps include common principles for cross-border financial
crisis management and the practical measures to improve the Lamfalussy process adopted by the ECOFIN in October and December, respectively. The
common principles have found their way into an EU-wide Memorandum of Understanding on cross-border crisis management and resolution.
Preparations for a new Solvency (II) Directive for insurance are ongoing. In February 2008, the Commission adopted an amended proposal for Solvency
II. The (tentative) timetable for the directive extends to 2012.
Integration of EU markets for housing finance: the Commission released the White Paper on Integration of EU Mortgage Markets on December 18,
2007. However, the White Paper proposes further investigation of the subject, and contains few immediate policy actions.

APPENDIX I—STATISTICAL ISSUES
EURO AREA POLICIES
Statistics for the euro area (and the EU-27) are produced by Eurostat and the ECB, generally
on the basis of data reported by the statistical services of member states. These statistics are
of sufficient quality, scope, and timeliness to allow effective macroeconomic surveillance.
Nonetheless, certain gaps and weaknesses remain, and these can be difficult to resolve given
institutional and other complexities, including the changing composition of the euro area and
EU. Although a high level of harmonization has been achieved in the statistical systems of
the EU Member States, national idiosyncrasies continue to represent fundamental obstacles
that can affect the comparability of data, for example due to differences in the structure of
countries’ financial systems. The IMF's Dissemination Standards Bulletin Board (DSBB) 19
provides comprehensive information on the Euro area’s statistical practices for the Special
Data Dissemination Standard (SDDS) data categories. Recent and ongoing developments
include:
•

The introduction of NACE rev. 2 will have a significant impact on the availability of
data. 20 NACE rev. 2 came into force on January 1, 2008, and will be introduced
gradually during the 2008–11 period. It provides a better and more detailed
classification of economic activities, tailored to the structure of a modern economy. It
better captures services and outsourcing and will lead to an increase in the measured
share of services in output. For the short-term statistics, Eurostat is working with the
member states to ensure that time series are recalculated back to 2000. However, in
other areas the limited potential for backcasting means that NACE rev 2 will lead to
significantly shorter dataseries or statistical breaks. The publication of some series
will be interrupted during the transition period.

•

The Principal European Economic Indicators produced by Eurostat are under review.
Consideration is being given to adding housing market indicators and further
tightening timeliness standards (as most existing targets have been met). Production
guidelines with respect to seasonal and calendar day adjustments have been approved
and will come into effect in the second half of the year. Work to harmonize revision
policies is ongoing, as is work on euro area vintage data.

•

For the national accounts, the ESA 95 transmission program was changed
substantially at the end of 2007, requiring member states to report more harmonized
data in greater detail. Also, guidelines for seasonal adjustment and calendar

and is the European classification system of economic activities. NACE is fully compatible with the UN’s ISIC
classification, but provides greater detail.

45
adjustment have been issued. Responsibility for the quarterly and annual sectoral
accounts has been merged and their timeliness has improved. Work is ongoing to
extend the annual series backward to 1995 and the quarterly series to 1999. Work on
nonfinancial balance sheets is ongoing as a long-term project, given important
technical challenges. Eurostat has discontinued the publication of national accounts at
constant prices in favor of chain-linked data at previous year’s prices.
•

A new regulation was issued in November 2007 21 that focuses the Harmonized
Indices of Consumer Prices (HICP) on “consumption segments” rather than products.
The regulation prescribes quality adjustments and gives Eurostat the ability to issue
standards for quality adjustment following a case-by-case approach. Pilot work on an
HICP index at constant tax rates has not been completed, partly because some large
countries decided not to participate. A regulation is being prepared to harmonize the
treatment of seasonal items, and an HICP Manual should be finalized shortly.

•

Work continues on the compilation of harmonized HICP data on prices for
owner-occupied housing. A pilot project covering 12 countries was completed last
year, and was followed by a new stage including 26 of the EU’s 27 member states.
Eurostat has also produced a manual on owner-occupied housing, and has embarked
on a two-year project to produce an international manual for residential real estate
prices.

•

Eurostat has started the release of a quarterly Government Finance Statistics
publication using the summary page presentation and of historic Excessive Deficit
Procedure (EDP) data on deficits and debt (i.e., prior to the notification period that
covers the last 4 years). It has also tightened the statistical accounting rules for
securitization operations by governments and is looking into the treatment of
government guarantees provided to financial institutions and of government debt
issued specifically to swap against private financial assets. Eurostat’s stepped-up
monitoring of member states’ fiscal accounts is improving and becoming more
consistent. All related documentation is published on its website. Resources for fiscal
monitoring have been increased significantly, with available staff doubling between
2004 and 2008, but the workload has expanded even more due to EU expansion and
increased data volumes.

•

A new framework regulation has been introduced to harmonize the compilation of
quarterly data on job vacancies 22 . Work continues to enhance and harmonize the
measurement quality of “hours worked,” which serves as input for various other
statistics including the Labor Cost Index. Work is ongoing with a view to improve the

22

European Parliament and Council Regulation (EC) No 4533/2008

46
models used for the calculation of the monthly unemployment rates published by
Eurostat.
•

In the area of short-term statistics, ongoing work focuses primarily on prices and
output in the services sector. A series of workshops has been organized with price
statisticians of Member States to ensure the harmonized compilation of Services
Producer Price Indices, reporting of which will start later this year. Eurostat aims to
produce an index of services production by 2012. A new series on import prices,
compiled on the basis of reporting by importers, has recently been published and
allows a clear differentiation between import prices and unit values.

•

With regard to structural business statistics, a new regulation has been introduced
covering statistics on business services and business demographics. An ad-hoc survey
is ongoing on international sourcing and a survey on access to financial services by
SMEs is being considered.

•

A comprehensive 5-year overhaul of business statistics (“Modernization of European
Enterprise and Trade Statistics”, MEETS) is about to start with the objectives of
improving the coverage and quality of data while also reducing the reporting burden
on enterprises.

•

The regulations covering Intrastat and Extrastat reporting23 are being revised, in part
with a view to reducing the reporting burden on enterprises. Asymmetries in intra-EU
trade and balance of payment statistics persist; data confidentiality is among other
things an obstacle for the ongoing efforts to reduce these asymmetries. The ongoing
revision of the basic statistical legislation us expected to facilitate the exchange of
confidential data between the EU Member States and Eurostat.

23

Intrastat covers intra-EU trade and is based on reporting by businesses. Extrastat covers extra-EU trade and is
based on customs declarations.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND
EURO AREA POLICIES
Staff Report for the 2008 Article IV Consultation with Member Countries
Supplementary Information
Prepared by the European Department
Approved by Alessandro Leipold and Adnan Mazarei
July 18, 2008
1.
This supplement provides an update of economic and policy developments since the
release of the staff report (7/2/08). The thrust of the staff appraisal remains unchanged. Also
attached is a draft background section of the Public Information Notice (PIN).
2.
Recent data confirm a marked slowdown in economic activity, as forecast by
staff, but also somewhat higher inflation (Table 1). Growth in 2008:Q1 was revised down
modestly, to a still strong 2.9 percent on a quarterly annualized basis (2.1 percent over
2007:Q1). But industrial production data for May and purchasing managers’ indices for
manufacturing and services in June point to very weak activity ahead. Also, recent trade data
for May show several euro area countries’ exports slowing sharply, in particular to the United
States. While inflation excluding energy and all food prices remained contained, at
1.8 percent in June, headline inflation reached 4.0 percent, essentially because of further
sharp energy price increases, and staff has raised its inflation forecast for 2008 and 2009
slightly upward, to 3.4 percent and 2.4 percent, respectively.
3.
Financial conditions have deteriorated. Over the past weeks, financial stocks have
fallen substantially, borrowing costs and credit default spreads have risen, and term spreads
in money markets have remained at elevated levels (Figure 1).
4.
As foreshadowed in the staff report, the ECB raised its policy rate by 25 basis
points to 4.25 percent on July 3 and markets essentially do not expect further moves.
The decision was fully priced in by markets and, according to the ECB, was “taken to prevent
broadly based second-round effects and to counteract the increasing upside risks to price
stability over the medium term.” The ECB considers that “the monetary policy stance
following today’s [July 3] decision will contribute to achieving our objective of price
stability”—a phrase interpreted by markets as implying no further changes. Despite the staff’s
upward revision, inflation is still projected to fall below 2 percent by end-2009, assuming
stabilizing energy prices, in line with oil futures markets data. Staff thus continues to believe
that, going forward, policy rates are best kept on hold while, as stated by the ECB, continuing
“to monitor very closely all developments over the period ahead.”

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
August 4, 2008

International Monetary Fund
700 19th Street, NW
Washington, D. C. 20431 USA

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2008 Article IV Consultation on
Euro Area Policies
On July 25, 2008, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded the
Article IV Consultation on Euro Area Policies. 1
Background
Ten years after its launch, monetary union is a distinct success and the euro area a zone of
stability in the international economy. However, economic union remains work in progress.
Improved wage setting and labor market reforms have contributed to the creation of some
16 million jobs over the past decade. Similarly, the single market program and product market
reforms have raised productivity in affected sectors. However, important challenges remain,
including large intra-euro area current account and competitiveness divergences.
More recently, the euro area has shown relative robustness to global shocks, but activity is
expected to slow due to high energy and food prices, tighter financial conditions, slowing global
demand, and the appreciation of the real effective exchange rate of the euro. Staff projects
annual average growth of 1.7 percent in 2008 and 1.2 percent in 2009, which masks a
deceleration in the course of 2008 and re-acceleration toward trend during 2009.
Headline inflation has recently reached its highest levels since the launch of EMU, pushed up
by energy and food prices. Nonetheless, underlying inflation and labor costs have been well
contained thus far, testifying to the high credibility of the European Central Bank (ECB). With
the economy slowing down, and provided food and energy prices stabilize, inflation should fall
appreciably from its current levels, although risks are high. In this context, the ECB raised

1

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On
return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the
Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the
Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the
country's authorities.

2

interest rates by 25bps on July 3, to 4.25 percent, while rising risk premia have pushed up key
money market interest rates to levels last reached during the mid-1990s.
The fiscal position of the euro area improved in 2007, reaching close to balance in structural
terms. However, a number of countries still face appreciable fiscal challenges. Many have not
yet reached their medium-term close-to-balance or surplus objectives, including almost all those
with high public debt. Furthermore, against the background of already some relaxation in 2008
budgets, expansionary impulses are mounting in several countries.
The outlook for financial stability is highly uncertain, although the area’s financial system
remains sound. While appreciable progress has been made with respect to banks' loss
recognition and recapitalization, many financial markets have yet to return to normal and the
global financial turmoil has led to a tightening of financial conditions. The pressure on firms and
households from higher risk premia and stricter lending standards, though not yet evident, will
likely build considerably over time. Balance sheets outside the financial sector, however, still
seem relatively robust.
Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors noted that, ten years after its launch, the European Monetary Union (EMU)
is a distinct success, and they commended the EMU’s macroeconomic policy framework for
bringing internal and external stability. Economic fundamentals have improved, although
continued efforts are needed to build a more vibrant economic union.
Directors observed that, conjuncturally, the euro-area economy is being strained by an array of
shocks—including from the commodity and financial markets—that is driving a combination of
decelerating activity and uncomfortably high inflation. They also noted that the euro is now on
the strong side relative to fundamentals. Directors concurred that growth will likely slow
substantially this year before reaccelerating toward trend during 2009.
Directors observed that monetary policy has to balance the risk of a broad-based increase in
inflation with the prospect of gradually building disinflationary forces due to slowing activity.
Much hinges on how labor costs and inflation expectations will evolve. Although durable
improvements in the functioning of labor markets and in anchoring inflation expectations have
been achieved under EMU, risks of second-round effects remain and will need to be guarded
against proactively. At the same time, Directors noted that financial conditions have tightened
substantially since last summer, and that the financial environment remains under strain from
the ongoing turbulence. In this setting, a number of Directors were of the view that policy rates
are best kept on hold, with the ECB continuing to monitor all developments very closely in the
period ahead. Other Directors emphasized the importance of vigilance in the face of the upside
risks to price stability, in particular should wage settlements hint at accelerating labor costs in
2009.

3

Directors agreed that the ECB’s policy frameworks have served it well in coping with the current
difficult environment. The ECB’s liquidity management framework has proven flexible and
robust. The key challenge going forward is to restore the depth and orderly functioning of
interbank markets. Directors welcomed the ECB’s plans to keep the operational framework
under continuous review, notably with respect to the collateral it accepts, and to ensure that the
framework’s rules are applied strictly. Directors noted that the ongoing work on enhancing the
ECB’s monetary analysis would help further strengthen the monetary policy framework, and
several suggested that this could lead in due course to a unified presentation of policy decisions
that integrates monetary and economic analysis.
Directors welcomed the steps taken to strengthen the EU’s financial stability framework. Given
the significant financial linkages and the EU’s commitment to build a single market for financial
services, Directors looked forward to further moves toward greater joint responsibility and
accountability for EU financial stability. This will require aligning national financial stability
frameworks with the EU’s commonly agreed principles for crisis prevention, management, and
resolution. In the near term, Directors stressed the need for further improvements in information
sharing among supervisors and central banks, including the ECB.
Directors observed that the rules-based fiscal framework offered by the Stability and Growth
Pact (SGP) has generally improved fiscal discipline and served the euro area well. However,
about half of the euro-area countries still face persistent challenges in meeting their mediumterm fiscal objectives. Progress with respect to lowering general government deficits and debt
will be key for these countries in order to better meet the population aging-related fiscal
challenges that are expected to mount rapidly after 2010. Accordingly, Directors agreed that the
room for fiscal policy responses to the current downturn should be a function of the leeway
allowed by the SGP. Support for more vulnerable sectors of the population should be well
targeted and not distort price signals. More generally, Directors noted that stronger national
fiscal rules and domestic governance mechanisms could help achieve more predictable and
efficient fiscal policies in countries facing relatively high public sector deficits and debt.
Directors observed that past and ongoing structural reforms are bearing fruit, but that large
parts of the services sector still remain to be opened to EU-wide competition. They emphasized
that the structural reform momentum needs to be maintained and re-oriented in a coordinated
manner to address intra-area disparities. Progress with this reform agenda would also be
consistent with commitments made under the Fund’s Multilateral Consultation on Global
Imbalances.
Directors looked forward to strong EU leadership in working toward an ambitious and balanced
conclusion of the Doha Round. They viewed lower agricultural trade barriers and lower
subsidies as the right approach to foster production and respond to high food prices, and in that
context, looked forward to the review of the Common Agricultural Policy next year. Directors
also welcomed the EU’s intention to keep its biofuels policies under review.

4

The views expressed by Executive Directors today will form part of the Article IV consultation
discussions on individual members of the euro area that take place until the next Board
discussion of euro area policies.

Public Information Notices (PINs) form part of the IMF's efforts to promote transparency of the IMF's
views and analysis of economic developments and policies. With the consent of the country
(or countries) concerned, PINs are issued after Executive Board discussions of Article IV consultations
with member countries, of its surveillance of developments at the regional level, of post-program
monitoring, and of ex post assessments of member countries with longer-term program engagements.
PINs are also issued after Executive Board discussions of general policy matters, unless otherwise
decided by the Executive Board in a particular case. The staff report (use the free Adobe Acrobat
Reader to view this pdf file) for the 2008 Article IV Consultation on Euro Area Policies is also available.

Statement by Klaus Stein, Executive Director for Germany, on behalf of the
Euro Area Authorities
July 22, 2008
In my capacity as President of EURIMF, 1 I am pleased to submit this statement on the
Article IV consultation with the euro area. My statement reflects the common view of the
euro-area Member States and the European Union (EU) in their respective fields of
competence.
The authorities of the euro-area Member States welcome the IMF staff's assessment of
economic developments and prospects in the euro area. While broadly concurring with the
findings of the IMF, on some issues views differ, as I will outline in my statement. I will also
update the Board on recent economic developments.
10 years of Economic and Monetary Union (EMU)
The euro-area authorities welcome the staff's positive assessment of the first 10 years of
EMU. The stability-orientated macroeconomic framework has helped to maintain stability
during turbulent times. The disappearance of intra-euro-area exchange rate risk and lower
cross-border transaction costs have helped further develop the Single Market and integrate
product markets. The single currency has also acted as a powerful catalyst for financial
market integration. Over the 10 years of its existence, the euro has firmly established itself as
second most important international reserve and investment currency.
The euro-area authorities share the view that monetary union has been a success and that the
numerous achievements that have been made over the past 10 years should not veil the fact
that some economic developments, notably overall output and productivity growth, defied
expectations. Economic union is not yet fully delivering. The euro-area authorities concur
with the staff in this regard and clearly see the need to further pursue structural reforms and
to address economic divergences in the euro area. In the reports on "EMU@10: successes
and challenges after 10 years of Economic and Monetary Union" and on the “10th
anniversary of the ECB” the European Commission (Commission) and the European Central
Bank (ECB) respectively take stock of the past decade and look at the challenges ahead.
Following the Commission’s communication the Council of Economics and Finance
Ministers (ECOFIN) and the Eurogroup are currently reflecting on practical measures to
improve economic policies and the functioning of EMU.

Short-term economic outlook
The global economy is cooling down markedly. So far, the slowdown in the euro area has
remained relatively modest as improved fundamentals, sound budgetary positions in most
Member States and past structural reforms have helped weather the strong global headwinds
to a large extent. Indeed, economic growth in the first quarter surprised on the upside.
However, there are divergences across Member States, reflecting, among other things, their
exposure to the financial markets turmoil, external deficits as well as the ongoing corrections
of housing markets. Nevertheless, as the strong first quarter was partly driven by temporary
factors, a considerable moderation can be expected in the second quarter.
Survey indicators show a continued marked deterioration in economic sentiment since the
peak last summer. While industrial confidence is currently still slightly above its long-term
average, services and consumer confidence are already below. Also, negative news continues
to flow from commodity and financial markets which could affect economic activity in a
more pronounced way then expected. Additionally, the euro area has been experiencing an
adverse exchange rate shock. Excessive volatility and disorderly movements in exchange
rates are undesirable for economic growth. In this context, the euro-area authorities share the
IMF analysis that the euro is now clearly on the strong side relative to fundamentals.
Looking further ahead, the economic outlook crucially depends on how the financial market
stress will unfold and whether oil prices keep on growing, feeding into inflation. In the euroarea authorities' view, tighter financing conditions and higher risk aversion will continue
taking a toll on investment, especially on housing in some countries, and, together with
declining confidence, could also dampen consumption going forward. Similarly, the
relentless increase in energy prices will weigh on consumption and investment. This in turn
should have a moderating effect on prices and wages.
The euro-area authorities concur with the staff that, in spite of the resilience so far, economic
growth could further moderate. In their view, the uncertainty surrounding the growth outlook
remains high, and the risks are on the downside.
Monetary policy and the outlook for price stability
To prevent broad-based second-round effects and counteract increasing risks to price stability
over the medium term, the Governing Council of the ECB raised the key ECB interest rate by
25 basis points on July 3. The latest data that have become available since the release of the
staff paper fully confirms the existence of upside risks to price stability.
Turning to the outlook for price developments, inflation has risen considerably since last
autumn, reaching worrying levels of around 4 percent in mid 2008. This mainly owes to
sharp increases in oil and food prices. In recent months upside risks to price stability have
intensified. First, these risks relate to possible further rises in commodity prices. Moreover,
the possibility of broad-based second-round effects and associated additional price pressures

3
are of particular concern to the Governing Council of the ECB. Initial signs of such secondround effects are already emerging in some euro area countries. In this particular context,
nominal wage indexation schemes should be avoided. Finally, unanticipated increases in
administered prices and indirect taxes contribute to upside risks to price stability over the
medium term.
The monetary analysis strongly supports the assessment of upside risks to price stability at
medium to longer horizons. The sustained underlying strength of monetary and credit
expansion in the euro area over the past few years has created upside risks to price stability.
Over recent quarters, these risks appear to have become manifest as inflation has trended
upwards. Thus, the continued strength of monetary dynamics represents an important signal
of the risks to price stability over the medium term that the ECB has been addressing through
its actions since end-2005. Moreover, a thorough assessment of the strength, maturity and
sectoral composition of bank borrowing suggests that the correction in financial markets has,
as yet, not significantly affected the availability of bank credit to the private sector.
The recent monetary policy decision demonstrates the ECB’s strong determination to keep
long-term inflation expectations firmly anchored in line with price stability, in accordance
with its mandate. It is the ECB’s contribution to preserving purchasing power over the
medium term and supporting sustainable economic growth and employment in the euro area.
In its current assessment, the Governing Council believes that the monetary policy stance
following the decision to raise rates on July 3 will contribute to achieving price stability over
the medium term. The Governing Council will continue to monitor very closely all
developments over the period ahead. As has been repeatedly stressed, the Governing Council
does not pre-commit to a specific course of action in the future.
Liquidity Management
In the last few months, the ECB has continued applying its existing framework for liquidity
operations with a view to alleviate tensions in the euro money market and to continue
steering very short term money market rates to the minimum bid rate. First, the ECB
continued “frontloading” its liquidity supply over the reserve maintenance periods to
properly respond to banks’ liquidity demand pattern and in accordance to reduced tensions
recently observed in the market, yet maintaining the average supply of liquidity unchanged
over the entire maintenance periods. Second, the ECB continued providing temporary
refinancing at longer maturities, by renewing in May and June 2008 the two supplementary
three-month longer-term refinancing operations (LTROs) initiated in August and September
2007, and by introducing supplementary LTROs with a six-month maturity, in April and in
July 2008. Third, the ECB continued the conduct of term auction facilities in cooperation
with the US Federal Reserve System and other central banks. Accordingly, it provided US
dollar liquidity to euro area banks, secured with Eurosystem eligible collateral. As on similar
occasions, these operations did not affect the supply of euro liquidity. Overall, the fact that a
broad range of counterparties has access to the Eurosystem’s large scale refinancing

4
operations against a wide range of eligible collateral, allowed the ECB to effectively counter
the stressed conditions in the short-term part of the money markets without having to change
the framework itself.
Fiscal developments and fiscal policy
The euro-area authorities share the staff's assessment of the improved budgetary situation in
2007. However, significant budgetary challenges lie ahead. In particular, the euro-area
authorities welcome the staff's overall positive assessment regarding the functioning of the
reformed Stability and Growth Pact (SGP). Countries with excessive deficits have made
significant structural efforts to correct their deficits within the deadlines established under the
reformed SGP. Consequently, no euro-area Member State is currently subject to the
excessive deficit procedure.
Despite these improvements, the euro-area authorities agree that in certain countries more
ambitious fiscal consolidation is needed, partly as a result of insufficient progress towards the
medium-term budgetary objectives during the upswing. In these countries safety margins visà-vis the 3 percent of GDP reference value are insufficient to make full use of the automatic
fiscal stabilizers to smooth the economic slowdown without excessive deficits emerging.
In this context, the euro-area authorities also highlight the risk related to the reversal of
accrued windfall revenues which could accentuate the budgetary effects of the economic
slowdown. As rightly pointed out in the staff's assessment, while the jury is still out on the
actual drivers of the tax buoyancy in recent years, experience suggests that a significant part
of it may be short-lived. With growth abating, a reversal in revenue windfalls would strain
the budgetary situation of those Member States which have not made sufficient use of the
upturn to improve their budgetary positions, further reducing their capacity to let automatic
stabilizers play.
The euro-area authorities confirm their strong commitment to the reformed SGP which
provides the best guidance for the conduct of fiscal policies at the current juncture. Stabilityoriented fiscal policies, in line with the SGP, allow achieving and maintaining sustainable
fiscal positions before the effects of ageing populations fully set in. Thereby, the SGP
supports confidence of consumers, producers and financial markets. Further progress towards
the medium-term objectives, in particular by expenditure restraint, contributes to alleviating
inflationary pressures, fostering an environment of sustainable growth. At the same time, the
working of the automatic stabilizers dampens the impact of the global economic slowdown.
It is worth noting that Member States progressively develop strategies to improve spending
efficiency with the use of performance indicators and of medium-term budgetary
frameworks. Pursuing effective medium-term budgetary frameworks and fiscal rules at
national level not only contributes to ensuring rigorous budgetary execution and compliance
with plans, but it also contributes to improving the quality and sustainability of public
finances. Increasing the efficiency of public spending and re-orientating it towards growth-

5
enhancing components can contribute to managing the ongoing growth slowdown and
accelerating the pace of the recovery.
In line with the conclusions of the June 2008 ECOFIN meeting and the principles set in the
Manchester 2005 ECOFIN meeting, the euro-area authorities concur with the staff's view that
tax policy should not be used to limit the pass-through of rising energy prices. Considering
that supply is highly inelastic, offsetting price increases with compensating tax cuts would
distort necessary adjustment to higher energy prices and risk adding to the terms-of-trade loss
experienced by the euro area as a net importer of energy. Other policies to protect vulnerable
groups are likely to be more effective and efficient.
Financial sector issues
As pointed out by the staff, financial stability has become a focus of attention among EU
policymakers. While financial integration has progressed significantly in recent years, the EU
financial-stability arrangements remain very much national-based. Various measures have
been taken to adapt these arrangements to reflect the growing cross-border dimension in
financial activity within the EU. These measures have acquired increased importance in the
context of the ongoing global financial turmoil. Particular attention has been given to
strengthening the Lamfalussy framework, where the Level-3 Committees have a significant
role to play in fostering supervisory convergence. Their functioning is to be improved by
including an EU dimension in the mandates of national supervisors, streamlining the
decision-making procedures and allocating to them specific tasks in promoting supervisory
convergence.
The euro-area authorities share the staff's view on the importance of organizing an efficient
exchange of information among supervisors, both in normal times and in times of crisis. To
this end, the 2005 EU-wide Memorandum of Understanding between national supervisors,
central banks and finance ministries has been significantly extended with effect from July 1
2008. The extension of the Memorandum of Understanding applies to both coverage and to
content. The coverage has been extended to include supervisors not only from the banking
sector but also from the insurance and securities sectors. As to the content, it has been
extended by the inclusion of basic principles for cross-border crisis management, a common
framework for assessing the systemic nature of a cross-border crisis and some procedural
guidelines in crisis management. In addition, the use of colleges of supervisors for crossborder financial groups is to be extended.
Also, the ECOFIN decided on a roadmap of actions to further enhance EU financial stability
arrangements. Among the issues to be addressed are relations between home-country and
host-country supervisors, the transfer of assets within a financial group, determining criteria
for applying early intervention and reorganization measures for cross-border financial groups
and improvements in deposit guarantee schemes. These issues are highly complex and touch
upon elements of national sovereignty. Therefore, the staff is right to highlight that reforms

6
in these areas will require strong political leadership and commitment. While complex to
design, and politically sensitive to pursue, these reforms are nevertheless essential to
safeguard the stability of the EU financial markets, and reap the maximum benefits from
financial integration.
Structural reform
The euro area has a special interest in the success of structural reform. In a partnership
approach between the Member States and the Commission, the Lisbon Strategy forms the
basis for steering the reform process in the euro area as a whole and in the individual
countries. The recommendations to the euro area, together with the country-specific
recommendations made within the Integrated Guidelines of the Lisbon Strategy, provide the
backbone for the coordination of structural reforms. The most recent assessments of progress
with structural reforms carried out by the Commission and the ECOFIN show signs that the
euro area countries have engaged in substantive structural reforms to tackle their economic,
social and environmental challenges. Nevertheless, there remain a number of policy areas
where challenges need to be tackled urgently, including strengthening the sustainability of
public finances and increasing competition in product, services and labor markets.
The euro-area authorities agree with the staff that there is scope for National Reform
Programs to pay more attention to the euro area recommendations, which aim to facilitate
economic adjustment in the monetary union.
The euro-area authorities share the staff's concerns about the intra-area divergences and
welcome the staff's support for improving internal surveillance. While some of these
divergences can be benign – reflecting the catching-up process or even normal adjustment –
they may also be harmful and the result of inefficient adjustment capabilities and/or
excessive unit labor cost increases. In this case, broadened and deepened intra-area
surveillance would be instrumental in early identifying of macroeconomic imbalances and
competitiveness trends in euro-area countries and in helping Member States devising swift
responses before divergences become entrenched. Going forward, it would be important to
provide the right incentives for structural reforms at the national level and to enhance
synergies between fiscal policies and structural reforms.
International issues
As noted by the staff, the EU will continue to strive for a comprehensive, ambitious and
balanced conclusion of the Doha Round. EU representatives are 'cautiously hopeful' that an
agreement can be reached this year, as they remain convinced that successful conclusion of
the trade talks would be supportive of global growth in the longer term. The EU continues to
play a key role in the efforts to push forward the negotiations. However, for negotiations to
be successful, it is important that other participants are also forthcoming and take a
constructive stand in the negotiations.

7
Parallel to the multilateral talks, which remain top priority, the EU is also pursuing free trade
agreement negotiations with India, Korea, Latin America and the ASEAN countries, as well
as regional partnerships with the African, Caribbean and Pacific countries. These agreements
complement the multilateral framework for trade liberalization and are seen as stepping
stones towards further trade integration.
Food prices are a major concern worldwide and the EU has launched initiatives to address
the challenges faced by the Member States but also other countries. The European Council
has endorsed several policy responses, both in the short- and in the long term. In the short
term, European countries will mobilize resources for humanitarian aid to developing
countries, examine the competitiveness in the food supply chain in the EU and the role of
speculation in recent price developments. In the long run, the EU will promote sustainable
production of biofuels and sustainable productivity growth in agriculture. It will undertake a
review of the Common Agricultural Policy phasing out restrictions to production, making
European farmers more responsive to price signals and to strengthen food security. The EU
will also enhance support to investments in agriculture in developing countries.
By targeting development aid, ensuring that market incentives are in place for a supply
response to develop, and discouraging export taxes, the EU's aim is to ensure that barriers to
international trade are lifted. Both consumers and producers will better respond to price
signals and market developments.
