EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
Background and outlook
Economic developments are dominated by the onset of oil production in 2003. After
strong oil-driven growth over the first half of the decade, economic activity turned sluggish.
Oil production began to decline in 2006. Non-oil growth has been depressed, in part due to
security problems. Food price inflation has increased sharply since end-2007. High oil
revenues have strengthened the external position but also boosted expenditures—notably
security and investments—resulting in large non-oil primary fiscal deficits. Budgetary
management is weak and concerns exist over the quality of public spending.
The macroeconomic outlook is fragile although external vulnerabilities appear
manageable. Chad is seriously affected by declining oil prices, which will require substantial
fiscal adjustment and will lower reserves, albeit not to critical levels. Otherwise, contagion
from the global crisis should be contained by the low global integration of Chad’s economy.
Policy discussions
The policy discussions focused on fiscal sustainability and external stability. To ensure
fiscal and debt sustainability, the mission recommended a medium-term fiscal adjustment
path consistent with a permanent income approach hypothesis. To reverse the rapid increase
in non-oil primary fiscal deficits, permanent expenditures should gradually be brought in line
with permanent (non-oil) revenues and made consistent with financing constraints. The
strategy should be three pronged: raising non-oil revenue collection, strengthening public
financial management to restore budget control, and improved efficiency and effectiveness of
spending. Staff called for a revised 2009 budget and medium-term fiscal framework to adjust
to a more negative oil price outlook. The authorities’ current overly optimistic oil price
assumptions and reliance only on lower security spending risked financing problems and
costly spending adjustments later on. Structural reforms must be accelerated to improve the
prospects for the non-oil sector and reduce the fiscal burden of inefficient public enterprises.
The real effective exchange rate has appreciated since 2000 but there is no strong
evidence that it is inconsistent with fundamentals. However, trade performance has been
flat over the past decade. Competitiveness is undermined by very high transport and energy
costs and a business climate among the weakest in low-income countries.
Fund relations
The authorities are keen on a staff-monitored program (SMP) starting in early 2009.
Progress will depend in particular on actions being taken to strengthen fiscal policy and
management.

I.

INTRODUCTION

1.
Chad is mired in security and political instability and this has impeded growth.
Ranking 170th on the UN’s Human Development Index, Chad is among the poorest countries
in the world. It has experienced some form of civil conflict for all but four of the past thirty
years. Most recently, Chad has been embroiled in conflict with Sudan and has endured
several major rebel assaults on its capital. The Darfur crisis has driven 290,000 Sudanese
refugees into Chad, adding to some 180,000 internally displaced persons. 1
2.
Oil production started in 2003 and offers a great opportunity while posing
difficult challenges. By 2008, oil accounted for 47 percent of GDP and oil revenues had
risen to 41 percent of GDP. 2 If

3.
A new poverty reduction strategy paper (PRSP) identified the key issues. The
second PRSP, adopted in 2008, sets out the government’s economic strategy through 2011. 3
With good governance and an environment conducive to growth as main objectives, it
highlights the importance of fiscal sustainability, sound public financial management, and
effective spending of oil revenue to promote economic diversification. It also argues for
continuation of structural reforms in the cotton and energy sectors.
4.
Relations with the donor community have been strained. Dissatisfied with the
implementation of the 1999 Petroleum Revenue Management Law—in particular the amount
and quality of spending in priority sectors—the World Bank asked Chad to prepay all
pipeline-related loans, permitting it to withdraw from the oil sector. But the Bank is expected

to reopen its field office—closed after the February 2008 rebel attacks—soon and start
discussions on its future engagement outside the oil sector. Disbursements of other donors
have also been delayed. The 2005-08 Fund-supported PRGF arrangement went off track due
to widening non-oil fiscal deficits, inadequate poverty orientation of spending, and slow
structural reform. A staff-monitored program (SMP) negotiated in July 2008 was not
approved by management due to additional expenditure overruns.
II.

RECENT ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS

5.
The main economic developments are summarized in Figure 2. Key points to
note are:
•

Economic growth has been subdued in 2007 and 2008. Real GDP increased by
only ¼ percent in 2007 due to weak non-oil growth and a sharp decline in oil
production owing to technical problems in several fields. Weak agricultural
production dampened non-oil sector growth, despite growing construction and service
activities related to higher public spending. Real GDP in 2008 is expected to decline
by ½ percent because of a further drop in oil production and the impact of the 2008
February rebel attack on economic activity over the first half of the year. Chad’s
growth rates are amongst the lowest in sub-Saharan Africa (Text Table 1).

•

The global economic crisis has affected the budget and reserves through lower
oil prices. Beyond this, Chad’s limited financial and trade integration has insulated it
from the financial crisis and ensuing global recession. Nevertheless, risks include
lower demand for exports and weaknesses in the foreign banks that own most of
Chad’s banking system.

•

Inflationary pressures picked up in the first half of 2008 owing to rising food
prices. After average inflation declined by 8¾ percent in 2007 as food prices fell
from the spike in 2006, inflation reached 11¾ percent on a 12-month basis at
end-November 2008, driven by a 21 percent increase in food prices over the same
period. This reflected a drop in food production, higher transportation costs from the
fuel price shock, and additional demand from international humanitarian
organizations.

6
•

Chad has not suffered from the food price crisis as much as other Sub-Saharan
African countries. Imported food accounts for only one quarter of the average
household consumption basket. The policy response has been to eliminate taxes and
fees on domestic sales of cattle, temporarily suspend cattle exports (lifted in
mid-September), ban food crop exports, provide a temporary lump-sum allowance to
low-income civil servants, and sell cereals to civil servants through the national food
security agency (ONASA).

•

High oil prices did not lead to significant retail fuel price subsidies. Retail fuel
prices—liberalized in 2001—rose by only 25 percent since end-2006 despite the near
doubling of international prices. Over half of Chad’s fuel is informally imported from
neighboring countries that subsidize prices. Pass-through is also limited through the
base for the VAT being administratively set below market prices, and remaining
unchanged since early 2006. The implicit subsidy is estimated at about ½ percentage
point of GDP in 2008.

•

The BEAC tightened monetary policy by raising reserve requirements and
policy interest rates. In response to emerging inflationary pressures, the central bank
increased its policy rates (¼ percent) and reserve requirements in July 2008. Broad
money has been growing rapidly (19 percent in the year to September 2008).

•

Non-oil fiscal deficits have been widening rapidly as oil revenues have increased.
The non-oil primary deficit (NOPD) deteriorated from 4 percent of GDP in 2004—
the onset of oil revenues—to 22 percent (commitment basis) in 2007. All spending
increased, but higher security and domestically-financed investment spending
accounted for about 40 percent and 30 percent of the increase respectively. A further
widening of the non-oil primary deficit to 28 percent of GDP is expected in 2008,
mainly on account of higher security spending following the February attacks.
Spending on security has risen very rapidly—from 2¼ percent of GDP in 2005 to
almost 14½ percent projected in 2008. 4 It is highly unpredictable and nontransparent, and is subject neither to budgetary scrutiny ex ante nor to audits ex post.

4

In 2006 security spending exceeded the initial budget allocation by 6¼ percent of GDP, in 2007 by 5¾ percent
and in 2008 by 8 percent. Over these three years, security spending turned out three times higher than initially
budgeted (31¾ percent of GDP versus 11¼ percent).

•

Domestically-financed priority sector spending 5 tripled since the advent of oil
revenues in 2004. From 2006 to 2008, spending on health and basic education each
increased by ½ percentage point of GDP.

•

Aid flows have declined significantly in the oil era. Total aid (grants and loans) was
equivalent to 10 percent of GDP in 2004 but declined to 5 percent in 2007. While
loans decreased, grants have remained relatively stable.

•

The REER has depreciated since end-2006 through November 2008 by
1¾ percent. The REER appreciated by 27 percent over 2000-06, reflecting higher
domestic inflation than trading partners and the strong appreciation of the Euro
against the dollar. However, over 2007-08, the REER depreciated mainly due to
lower inflation while other CEMAC countries, most of them significant oil producers,
experienced appreciation.

•

Steadily increasing oil prices through mid-2008 have helped strengthen the
external current account and official reserves. The 45 percent improvement in the
terms of trade over 2006-08, despite declining oil production, raised export proceeds
by 22 percent. But imports also grew strongly, by 66 percent overall and 60 percent
outside the oil sector, and the trade surplus moved from 37 percent of total GDP in
2005 to 32 percent in 2008. Oil production was also responsible for large earnings
outflows, most of which were reinvested so that the capital account was highly
positive. On balance, despite a negative current account balance, substantial reserves
were accumulated. Import cover is expected to rise to 10½ months of imports of nonoil goods and services in 2008, from 5¼ months in 2006.

•

Chad has improved its compliance with the CEMAC convergence criteria
thanks to the oil windfall (Text Table 2). Since 2005 it no longer has a negative
basic fiscal balance nor has it accumulated arrears since that time.
III.

MEDIUM-TERM OUTLOOK AND POLICY DISCUSSIONS

6.
The policy discussions focused on ensuring fiscal sustainability and external
stability and competitiveness against the backdrop of the global economic slowdown
and weakening commodity prices. The mission recommended fiscal adjustment start with
the 2009 budget signaling a policy stance that is sustainable and consistent with available
financing over the medium term. External vulnerabilities and major constraints to
competitiveness exist, even though estimates of the equilibrium real exchange rate found
limited evidence of inconsistency with Fundamentals.

5

Expenditures are not classified by function. Here priority sector spending is defined as the sum of spending by
all ministries and agencies whose mandate, as agreed between the government and the staffs of the Bank and
Fund, has a strong poverty orientation. It excludes security spending.

A. Medium-Term Macroeconomic Framework
7.
The medium-term macroeconomic outlook is fragile given the global recession
and the outlook for oil prices (Table 1). Non-oil growth is expected to average 4¾ percent
over 2009-11 driven by the service sector, construction, and manufacturing. Oil growth
reflects gradually declining production absent the discovery of new exploitable reserves.
With adoption of a sustainable fiscal policy (see the “adjustment” scenario in Text
Table 3)—where the non-oil deficit is reduced to 10½ percent by 2011 in line with the
permanent income framework described in Box 1—import cover would increase to over one
year by 2012. The less ambitious adjustment in the 2009 budget combined with the lower
WEO oil prices would lead to fiscal financing gaps in 2009 and over the medium term (see
“WEO oil prices” scenario in Text Table 3). Absent further domestic shocks, inflation is
projected to revert to its historical level of 3 percent over the medium term. Important risks
to macroeconomic stability exist from security and political instability, further declines in
oil prices, and failure to re-establish strong relations with key donors, impeding financing
and policy support.
B. Fiscal Sustainability
8.
The mission proposed a modified permanent income framework to guide fiscal
policy (Box 1). 6 Fiscal policy can become sustainable if expenditures are gradually reduced
to the level of permanent (non-oil) revenues. The declining path for the non-oil primary
deficit the mission proposed recognizes that Chad’s large investment needs and potential for
catch-up growth justify a drawdown of accumulated reserves, and protects priority sector
spending (see adjustment scenario in Text Table 3 and Box 1). Staff simulations suggest the
sustainable long-term non-oil balance ranges from a small surplus to deficits of around
3 percent of GDP depending on the model used and the speed of adjustment.

9.
Staff advised a three-pronged approach to reducing the non-oil primary
balance while strengthening poverty reduction efforts: (i) improving public financial
management (PFM) through the strict respect of budgetary procedures and other key PFM
reforms; (ii) enhancing non-oil revenue collection through reforms in tax and customs
administration; and (iii) improving the efficiency and targeting of spending, including
efforts to increase the returns to public investment and raise absorptive capacity.
10.
The authorities agreed with the analysis of fiscal sustainability and proposed
adjustment strategy but stressed the attendant challenges. Fiscal policy is under constant
pressure from security shocks and demands from a population with large unmet basic
service needs. Nevertheless, they agreed that the large non-oil fiscal deficit should be

12
reduced. The 2009 budget already aimed for a sizeable reduction, particularly its efforts to
curtail security spending. The authorities acknowledged that the wage bill and transfers to
inefficient public entities were placing an excessive claim on resources, concurring that
these outlays had to be forcefully addressed as part of medium-term fiscal consolidation.
11.

Progress on the fiscal strategy has been limited to date:

•

PFM remains weak across the board. Budgets experience excessive delays, normal
budget procedures are often bypassed, extrabudgetary spending occurs, 7 mediumterm budgeting and cash management are underdeveloped, and non-competitive
procurement is prevalent. Concerns also exist over the weak links between annual
budgets and the PRSP and priority actions programs, with ad-hoc budgetary additions
undermining established priorities. Moreover, line ministries play too limited a role in
formulating their budgets and their capacity for budget execution and monitoring
needs strengthening. The authorities agreed that concerted efforts were required. They
have introduced a visa de crédit system to stop commitments without budget
appropriations, and established an investment database. They also emphasized the
importance of donor support for the PAMFIP (Plan d’Action pour la Modernisation
des Finances Publiques). The authorities have started to clear domestic arrears
(CFAF 14 billion or ¾ percent of GDP in 2008) and intend to finalize a
comprehensive arrears clearance plan in 2009 (under preparation since 2005).

•

Staff encouraged public dissemination of the budget, budget execution reports and
procurement information. Staff expressed concerns over the Cabinet’s decision to
request Parliament to exempt the government from submission of draft budget review
laws (Lois de Règlement) for 2004 through 2008.

•

Non-oil revenues are well below other African oil exporters (Text Table 1), but tax
reforms are proceeding slowly. The authorities reiterated their intention to undertake
a comprehensive review of tax policy, including the fiscal regime for the oil sector.
Tax administration would benefit from making the large taxpayers unit operational,
and from a medium-term action plan to address the large leakages in customs (IMF
technical assistance in tax and customs administration has been requested).

•

Development partners, including the Fund, have drawn attention to problems with the
composition, cost and quality of public spending. The authorities agreed the wage bill
could be rationalized, including through an employee census, computerization of the

7

Treasury balances outside the banking system had been overestimated because of unrecorded extrabudgetary
spending, possibly on security outlays. The mission revised spending in 2007 and 2008 upward by ½ and 1
percent of GDP respectively, and the authorities promised revised and reconciled statements.

13

Box 1. PIH Frameworks and the Sustainable Non-Oil Primary Deficit (NOPD)
Permanent income hypothesis (PIH) frameworks are flexible in accommodating country-specific
circumstances. In a PIH framework, government consumption depends on stable oil wealth, not
volatile oil revenue. Convergence to a sustainable NOPD may be achieved by front-loaded fiscal
adjustment or more gradually to minimize adjustment costs or allow for habit persistence. A LIC
could opt for gradualism permitting higher levels of investment spending early on. However, unless
that investment is productive, the delayed adjustment implies a lower sustainable non-oil primary
deficit. PIH approaches can also assume that oil wealth is consumed over a relatively long but finite
time period to capture political economy considerations. As a result, PIH frameworks have been
applied to several oil-producing countries including those facing similar challenges to Chad, such as
Congo, Cameroon and Gabon. *
The application of the
Non oil primary balance path and net debt path using Carcillo, Leigh, and Villafuerte 2007
PIH and other
frameworks points out
that Chad’s current
NOPD is far too high.
The results in the table
below suggest that the
long-run sustainable
NOPD ranges from a
small surplus to low
single-digit deficits.
Chad’s 2008 NOPD will
be close to 28 percent.
These
results are robust to sensitivity analysis on the parameters of the models including on oil revenues.

payroll, and some demobilization if security permitted. They also agreed existing
investments should be rendered productive through adequate allocations for recurrent
costs. Staff stressed the need to complete existing projects before launching new ones,
and to restrain for now investment in sectors—such as health and education—with
absorptive capacity constraints.
C. The 2009 Budget
12.
The 2009 budget envisages a significant reduction in the non-oil primary deficit
but needs to go further. Cabinet approved a non-oil primary deficit that is 7 percentage
points lower than the expected 2008 outturn, or 21¼ percent of GDP (Tables 2-3). While
commending these efforts, staff pointed out that the overall balance turns sharply negative in
2009 due primarily to lower prices. 8 Additional spending adjustment in the order of
4½ percent of non-oil GDP is needed in 2009 to avoid financing problems.
13.
Staff urged the authorities to present to Parliament a revised budget that
addressed the following fiscal risks:
•

Oil revenue projections underpinning the budget were overly optimistic. Due to a
higher oil reference price, the 2009 budget projects almost 16 percent of non-oil GDP
more in oil revenue than the staff’s forecast using WEO prices. If these higher prices
do not materialize, financing gaps will emerge and costly expenditure adjustments
may be inevitable. The authorities also need to fully take into account the impact of a
September 2008 agreement with the oil consortium.

•

Expenditure adjustment banking solely on lower military outlays was highly
risky. Non-security spending should be rationalized, notably the wage bill─which
alone consumes almost all non-oil revenues─and transfers to public enterprises. The
dramatic growth in investment spending should also be contained to avoid disruptions
of projects critical to growth, and to support a cushion of savings for possible further
shocks. Addressing weaknesses in tax collection should begin vigorously in this
budget.

14.
Despite these risks, the authorities preferred to proceed with their budget but
stood ready to undertake mid-course corrections. The authorities committed to stronger
non-oil revenue collection, accelerated reforms of the state water and electricity utility
(STEE) and cotton company (Cotontchad), and efforts to moderate the wage bill. They
would execute the budget in a restrained manner, and issue a budget amendment in mid-year
if oil prices did not recover. Staff counseled that a revised budget would be more prudent in
an environment of weak expenditure control and any windfall revenues could be used to
reconstitute savings or amend the budget if needed.
8

The drop is accentuated by the amendments to the concession agreed with the oil consortium in September
2008 which include a new income tax advance system that shifts receipts from 2009 to 2008, and a one-time
payment in 2008 partially offset by lower taxes in 2009.

15
15.
Staff urged removal of the export ban on food crops with immediate effect.
Recognizing that the ban impedes trade and negatively affects incentives for producers, the
authorities committed to do this at the earliest opportunity. Staff recommended vigilance on
food prices. There should be adequate budgetary appropriations for the food security agency
to replenish its stocks. And there should be better targeting than directing assistance to civil
servants.
D. Oil Revenue Management
16.
Oil revenues appear well captured in the budget but improvements in
monitoring and transparency are desirable. Chad’s oil sector and oil fiscal regime are
relatively simple compared with other oil producers in the region. Moreover, Chad is unique
in that all royalties and dividends are paid into a single offshore account, while all income
taxes and other fees go directly to the central bank. 9 But in anticipation of a more complex
oil revenue situation, staff encouraged the authorities to strengthen monitoring, including
through improved flows of oil sector information within government. To maximize oil
revenues, the authorities should exercise all their audit rights, using independent auditors
with an international reputation. Staff encouraged the authorities to move on the Extractive
Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI) and join all other CEMAC countries in becoming
an EITI candidate country.
17.
A new petroleum revenue management law (PRML) is needed. Key features of
the 1999 PRML have been abolished (Fund for Future Generations), modified (definition of
priority sectors) or are uncertain (future of the College 10 and offshore account). A new
PRML should focus on the key principles of fiscal sustainability, use of oil revenues to
support priority sectors, unified budget management, improved transparency and reinforced
accountability. The authorities are interested in a new PRML to replace the current interim
mechanism that would cover all oil revenues and extend College oversight to all investment
spending. Discussions on design are expected in 2009, in collaboration with key partners. 11
E. Structural Reform
18.
Reform of large public enterprises has stalled and their fiscal burden has
continued to mount. Two loss-making parastatals require transfers that increased from
¾ percent of GDP in 2005 to 1¾ percent in 2008. The mission recommended that all
parastatals prepare and publish properly audited financial statements.

9

The oil consortium publishes detailed quarterly payment information (http://www.essochad.com/ChadEnglish/PA/TD_HomePage.asp).
10
An independent body with civil society participation responsible for approving the use of oil royalties and
dividends.
11
The European Union and European Investment Bank are already in discussions with the authorities on a
system for monitoring oil revenue collection, on which they have sought Fund staff collaboration.

16
•

Cotontchad’s production is in serious decline—by one-third from 2004-06 to
2007-08—and it has accumulated losses of 1½ percent of GDP. Progress towards the
planned privatization has been slow but contracts have be signed for a financial and
technical audit. One third of the population depend on cotton and the authorities
indicated that official support to the sector through direct subsidies and governmentguaranteed loans will therefore continue. However, recognizing the difficulty of
competing internationally against highly-subsidized cotton, the authorities were open
to encouraging farmers to pursue other opportunities.

•

STEE’s finances have deteriorated due to poor management, weak bill collection,
rising fuel costs, and technical problems, and subsidies are increasing to 1¼ percent
of GDP in 2008. In response, the authorities have decided to break up the company
into separate water and electricity entities, and devise a roadmap of reform by
end-2008 which will include performance contracts. Given the vital importance of
cost-effective energy to Chad’s development, the mission urged progress on
initiatives such as a “topping plant” to lower fuel costs.

19.
Fiscal risks from the new state-oil company need to be carefully managed. The
Société d’Hydrocarbures du Tchad (SHT) was established in 2007, and will be the
government’s vehicle for greater participation in the oil sector. 12 This company has already
begun to receive transfers, and presents further fiscal risks in terms of foregone revenue.
The mission argued that state-oil companies can make a positive economic contribution
provided they have good corporate governance, adequate political oversight and transparent
relations with the budget. The authorities confirmed the Council of Ministers will exercise
political oversight over all major SHT decisions with budgetary implications.
F. External Stability and Debt Sustainability
20.
The REER has appreciated since 2000 but there is no strong evidence that it is
inconsistent with fundamentals (Box 2). The CEMAC’s fixed exchange rate regime
provides a reliable nominal anchor for an economy regularly hit by fiscal and price shocks.
Assessments of the equilibrium exchange rate found no significant under- or over-valuation.
Problems with data on prices of non-tradables and profitability in the non-oil sector impede
an evaluation of Dutch disease symptoms, although the high import content of oil activity
and its relatively recent start may explain the limited incidence to date. However, Chad’s
non-oil export performance over the past decade has been stagnant. This is consistent with
the findings of the 2006 Diagnostic Trade Integration Study that structural factors such as
inadequate infrastructure and public services, deficiencies in the business climate, and weak
governance are major constraints on competitiveness. 13 The authorities concurred with
12

SHT will manage all government participations in oil-related ventures, including the government’s 40 percent
share in a joint venture with a Chinese company to build and operate a refinery and power plant at an estimated
cost of $1 billion with a starting date now set for 2010.

17
staff’s assessment of the real exchange rate, and stressed their efforts to lower production
costs by improving infrastructure.
21.
Chad’s balance of payments will deteriorate in 2009 but does not appear to be
acutely vulnerable. Large fluctuations in the capital and financial account (Table 5) mostly
represent foreign direct investments by the oil companies, offset by oil-related imports and
services and income outflows. With oil accounting for ninety percent of exports, the main
external vulnerability relates to the trade account impact of a further drop in oil prices. Oil
production itself would not appear to be a risk: output has been stabilized and is deemed
profitable even at world oil prices of $20-25 per barrel. The authorities were satisfied with
the protection offered by current and projected reserves levels: around five months coverage
of all imports (including oil-related imports) and 10 months of non-oil imports. The pooling
of reserves at the BEAC provides another layer of comfort.
Box 2. Chad: Real Effective Exchange Rate Assessment
An assessment under the CGER methodologies shows that the REER has appreciated moderately in
recent years. There is no robust evidence of inconsistency with fundamentals but data limitations are
significant. This is in line with the CEMAC assessment during the 2008 Article IV consultation, which
concluded that even though there is evidence of moderate overvaluation, the zone’s REER remains
consistent with external stability.
•
Equilibrium Real Exchange Rate Approach. Regressions on the fundamentals with different
specifications failed to show a significant relation between the REER and fundamentals.
•
Macroeconomic Balance Approach. The underlying current account is estimated at
-8¾ percent of total GDP and the current account norm (using CGER coefficients) at -5¾ percent of total
GDP. Estimations under this approach show a slight overvaluation of the REER of about 3½ percent.
•
External Sustainability Approach. A benchmark level of the net foreign asset (NFA) position is
estimated taking into account the profile of FDI, and the size of the REER adjustment calculated required to
close the gap between the NFA stabilizing current account and the underlying current account. Estimation
over 2010-28 shows this gap to be 2 percent of total GDP, implying the REER is overvalued by about
2¼ percent.

22.
Chad’s risk of debt distress is moderate and its overall public sector debt
dynamics appear sustainable (see Supplement 2). A preliminary version of the Debt
Sustainability Analysis (DSA) was discussed with the authorities. The oil windfall of recent
years has improved Chad’s debt ratios, with timely debt servicing and limited new
borrowing. 14 15 The debt outlook is favorable but risks include the possibility that oil revenue
spending does not produce the desired non-oil growth and fails to raise non-oil revenues. The
14

The problem of periodic, short-term arrears in payments to the Fund has been much reduced since the
introduction of an automatic payment mechanism with the BEAC in 2007.
15
Chad could have an external arrear to a private creditor of around $7 million deriving from a claim dating
back to 2002. This creditor prevailed in international arbitration and in a court case over its right to attach
Chadian government assets in the U.K.

18
authorities intend to continue their prudent approach to debt management. The mission urged
them to limit debt-financed state participation in various oil ventures. It commended them for
resisting offers of non-concessional financing since that would compromise Chad’s progress
to HIPC and MDRI debt relief, in which there remains a strong interest.
G. Improving Growth Prospects
23.
Beyond resolution of the conflict, strong growth will depend on sound
macroeconomic management and higher factor productivity. The authorities agreed that
Chad’s growth prospects depend critically on the effective use of its oil receipts to improve
its productive capacity. While an environment conducive to further exploration and
extraction might augment oil resources, the focus should be on enhancing opportunities for
non-oil private sector growth. This requires good governance and a stable investment
climate, areas where Chad languishes even relative to other low-income countries.16 Staff
supported the authorities’ major efforts to improve basic infrastructure in health, education,
roads, electricity, water, telecommunications, all critical to growth. Going forward the choice
of investments should observe sectoral absorption limitations and maximize poverty
reduction. Because of its poverty impact, the authorities are considering stepping up
investment in infrastructure supporting agricultural and livestock growth.
24.
The financial system is vulnerable and underdeveloped (Box 3), and as a
consequence constrains non-oil growth. Weak financial institutions operate in a shallow
system. Access to credit is problematic, with banking services virtually non-existent outside
major urban centers. Financial depth (measured by broad money to GDP) was only
12 percent in 2007, compared with 30 percent on average in African low income countries.
Low financial intermediation results from an unstable security situation, a poor legal and
economic environment, and the lack of deposit insurance. In response, a new national
microfinance strategy aims to boost such lending from the current equivalent of 3 percent of
banking system lending. The government is also contemplating a housing finance scheme,
funded from the budget, by donors and through a levy on salaries.

16

19

Box 3. Summary Assessment of Financial System Soundness
Chad’s banking system is subject to several vulnerabilities, stemming from its lack of depth, some
undercapitalization, and insufficient on-site supervision (see the CEMAC FSAP (www.imf.org) for
more details.) Asset quality has improved over recent years with gross non-performing loans lower
than the CEMAC average, although provisioning levels were also lower than the community
average. Some banks are capital deficient (on the basis of risk-weighted assets). Since 2004, several
banks (3 of 7) have persistently exceeded the single borrower limit (15 percent of equity). The
narrow credit market, comprising mainly government and a few large-size enterprises, raises
portfolio risk. Significant government involvement in the banking sector─as shareholder
(25 percent ownership overall) and customer─adds to those problems. However, because of limited
competition, the sector remains profitable, fairly stable and growing. More frequent on-site
inspections of banks are required. Supervision of microfinance institutions is virtually non-existent.

PROGRAM RELATIONS

25.
The authorities are keen on an SMP but staff stressed this is conditional on
progress in key areas. An SMP in 2009 would require a strong 2009 budget, agreement on a
feasible medium-term fiscal framework, evidence of adherence to budget controls, and
progress on the composition and quality of spending. The authorities would like an SMP to
start promptly in order to pave the way to a new PRGF, and eventually to HIPC and MDRI
debt relief.
V.

STAFF APPRAISAL

26.
The paramount challenge for the authorities is how to seize the development
opportunity offered by the next decade of oil revenues. The restoration of peace and
political stability are clearly critical. Despite insecurity, progress has been made during the
oil windfall years in priority sector spending, even though the development impact is still
awaited. Macroeconomic management must be sound in order to build on these
achievements. The effective use of oil revenues for poverty reduction and growth is even
more pertinent in today’s environment of weaker global demand and lower oil prices. Fiscal
policy must start urgently to follow a sustainable medium-term path, necessitating significant
reductions in the non-oil primary deficit.
27.
Fiscal policy should be tightened in 2009 and over the medium term. A lower
more realistic oil price assumption should be adopted in the 2009 budget. And the tighter
revenue outlook calls for more ambitious efforts to address non-security spending, such as on
the wage bill and transfers to public enterprises, and in raising the low non-oil revenue take.
These actions would avoid costly corrections later in the year.
28.
Strengthening public expenditure management continues to be key for
improving the growth and poverty impact of fiscal policy. Serious efforts must be made to
re-establish budget control and improve the efficiency of public spending. Chad’s largely
sound budget procedures need to be respected, with large extrabudgetary spending and the
use of exceptional procedures curtailed. An appropriate balance between investment
spending and the requisite recurrent inputs must be ensured. More competitive procurement
will help raise the quality and development impact of public spending, and enhanced fiscal
transparency—on military spending, financial statements of public enterprises, and in budget
execution—will aid accountability. Recent efforts to begin clearance of domestic arrears are
laudable, as is the government’s intention to continue eschewing non-concessional
borrowing.
29.
The capacity for collecting oil revenue needs to improve with the complexity of
the sector. Chad is to be commended for its effective and reasonably transparent oil revenue
collection system but should prepare for a more complex future, with more producers and
revenue streams. Rapid progress to becoming an EITI candidate country and publishing an

21
EITI report would usefully complement these efforts, and should be relatively simple given
the information already in the public domain.
30.
Raising economic growth, productivity and strengthening competitiveness
demand an acceleration of long overdue structural reforms. The current global crisis and
dramatic turnaround in oil revenue highlights again the urgency of diversifying the economy,
reform of key parastatals (electricity, water and cotton), and improving competitiveness
through a more attractive business climate, developing basic infrastructure, deepening the
financial sector, and improving governance.
31.
Serious data shortcomings hamper surveillance (see Supplement 1). The highest
priorities are the national accounts and balance of payments data. Sufficient resources should
be allocated to the National Statistics Institute (INSEED) and BEAC for statistical collection
and analysis.
32.
Staff recommends that the next Article IV consultation be held on the 12-month
cycle subject to the Board decision on consultation cycles (Decision No. 12794-(02/7) dated
July 15, 2002, as amended).

Assistance committed under the original framework is expressed in net present value (NPV) terms at the
completion point, and assistance committed under the enhanced framework is expressed in NPV terms at the
decision point. Hence these two amounts can not be added.

Under the enhanced framework, an additional disbursement is made at the completion point corresponding to
interest income earned on the amount committed at the decision point but not disbursed during the interim
period.
VIII. Implementation of Multilateral Debt Relief Initiative (MDRI): Not Applicable

IX.
Safeguards Assessments
The Bank of the Central African States (BEAC) is the regional central bank of the Central
African States. The most recent safeguards assessment of the BEAC was completed on
August 30, 2004. The assessment found that the Bank has implemented a number of
measures to strengthen its safeguards framework since the 2001 safeguards assessment, and
recommended further enhancements in the areas of external and internal audits, and financial
reporting. Latest monitoring results indicate the existence of certain vulnerabilities including
in the system of internal controls. These and other aspects of the BEAC safeguards
framework will be reviewed in the context of the 2008 update safeguards assessment of
BEAC that is underway.
X.
Exchange Rate Arrangement
The exchange system common to all members of the BEAC has been free of restrictions on
payments and transfers for current international transactions. The BEAC common currency is
the CFA franc, which was formerly pegged to the French franc. Repurchase of CFA franc
banknotes exported outside the BEAC was suspended on August 2, 1993. Effective

5
January 12, 1994, the CFA franc was devalued by 50 percent in foreign currency terms, and
the exchange rate was adjusted from F 1=CFAF 50 to F 1=CFAF 100. Since January 1, 1999,
the CFA franc has been pegged to the Euro at the rate of EUR 1=CFAF 655.957.

III—STATISTICAL ISSUES
(As of December 23, 2008)
I. Assessment of Data Adequacy for Surveillance
General: Data provision have serious shortcomings that significantly hamper surveillance.
1.
National accounts: The accuracy and reliability of key national aggregates are
seriously affected by weak source data due to inadequate funding for the National Institute of
Statistics, Economic and Demographic Studies (INSEED). Consequently, there is a high
degree of uncertainty regarding estimates of the level and growth rate of GDP and
expenditure components that impact on ratios scaled by GDP. Timeliness of the national
accounts also impacts on surveillance: since early 2007, with assistance from AFRISTAT
and Central AFRITAC, the authorities made a number of improvements and are currently in
process of finalizing the national accounts estimates for 2005. Sustained improvement in the
utility of the national accounts for surveillance will require a durable and substantial increase
in resources, as well as ensuring absorption and retention of know-how transferred through
technical assistance.
2.
Price statistics: In January 2008, the Harmonized Consumer Price Index (IHPC)
covering the capital replaced the dated CPI. However, significant work is still needed to
improve the reliability and visibility of the IHPC. An August 2008 Central-AFRITAC
mission agreed with INSEED a short-term program to improve timely production of the
IHPC using new software.
3.
Government finance statistics: reported for surveillance purposes include a quarterly
Tableau des opérations financières de l’État (TOFE) and monthly debt statistics. The TOFE
generally follows the presentational recommendations of the GFSM 1986, but is compiled by
a working group drawing source data from disparate administrative sources, resulting in
discrepancies between the central government operations and financing data.
4.
Monetary and financial statistics: Monetary statistics, interest rates, and exchange
rates are provided for surveillance purposes. The 2005 data ROSC mission found that the
coverage of monetary statistics is limited to the central bank and commercial banks, whereas
microfinance corporations, a growing source of finance in the country, are not covered by the
depository corporations survey. The monetary data on net credit to government frequently
can not be reconciled with the fiscal data, owing to differences in the institutional coverage
and grouping of units in general government and the public sector.

9

5.
In addition, the accuracy of monetary statistics may be affected by large cross-border
movements of banknotes among Central African Economic and Monetary Union (CEMAC)
member countries. About 40 percent of banknotes issued in Chad by the BEAC national
directorate circulate in Cameroon, while currency in circulation in Chad includes some
10 percent of banknotes from Cameroon and 5 percent of banknotes from the Central African
Republic.
6.
The BEAC started in mid-2007 a project to migrate monetary statistics of member
countries of the CEMAC to the methodology in the Monetary and Financial Statistics
Manual (MFSM). As part of this project, a regional workshop was organized by the BEAC in
December 2007 to finalize the mapping of source data from commercial banks to the MFSM
concepts and framework. STA participated in this workshop to provide guidance and advice. The
BEAC has yet to submit test data using the standardized report forms.

7.
External sector statistics: The poor quality of external sector statistics appears to be
related to inadequacies in staffing and in provision of material resources dedicated to
compilation. The foreign trade data, compiled by the INSEED on the basis of customs
declarations are known to be unreliable, and to suffer from coverage problems; in addition,
they are believed to be inconsistent with those used in the compilation of national accounts.
Consequently, they are not fully used by the BEAC national directorate in the compilation of
balance of payments statistics. Data on exports are estimated based on data provided by line
ministries. Even considering the difficulty of collecting data on informal border trade
between Chad and its neighboring countries, many improvements could be made to items
such as imports, cotton and cattle exports, freight, and public transfers. Tighter coordination
among the CEMAC, INSEED, and other agencies is required in order to improve the data
coverage.
II. Data Standards and Quality
8.

Chad participates in the General Data Dissemination System. A data ROSC was

published in August 2007.

III. Reporting to STA (Optional)
9.
Chad does not report government finance statistics for publication in the Government
Finance Statistics Yearbook or in International Financial Statistics (IFS). Balance of
payments statistics are not reported for publication in the Balance of Payments Statistics
Yearbook or IFS. Monetary and financial statistics, as well as international liquidity and
exchange rates are reported for publication in IFS.

INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION AND
INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND
CHAD
Joint Fund-Bank Debt Sustainability Analysis Under the Debt Sustainability
Framework for Low-Income Countries
Prepared by the staffs of the International Development Association and
the International Monetary Fund
Approved by Sudhir Shetty and Carlos Alberto Braga (IDA)
and Anthony Boote and Emilio Sacerdoti (IMF)
January 13, 2009
Based on the external Low-Income Country (LIC) Debt Sustainability Analysis (DSA),
Chad’s risk of debt distress is moderate although subject to important risks in the external
environment and the conduct of economic policy. The inclusion of domestic debt does not
alter the assessment of Chad’s risk of debt distress. 1
I.

BACKGROUND

Recent Developments in external debt
1.
Chad’s external debt situation has improved considerably over the past few years,
thanks to the strong growth in overall GDP stemming from the oil sector, reduced external
financing, and continued debt servicing. By end-2005—the basis for the last DSA 2 —the
stock of debt had already declined to below 30 percent of GDP, from over 60 percent at the
HIPC Initiative decision point. Since then, it has declined further to 23 percent of GDP at
end-2007. All of Chad’s external debt is public debt, and the bulk is owed to the multilateral
creditors IDA and the African Development Bank (AfDB) (see Text Table 1). Nominal debt
levels are sensitive to exchange rate changes, mainly through the Euro-dollar rate given that
the CFA franc has a fixed parity with the Euro (about one quarter of debt is denominated in
Euro or CFA). Debt levels have been reduced further because Chad made principal payments
as scheduled while contracting only moderate amounts of new debt. Moreover,
disbursements suffered when creditors started encountering problems in project execution. In
2008, the debt stock declined significantly after Chad prepaid to the IBRD the balance on the
loan that financed the government’s equity share in the oil pipeline plus to IDA the two
associated credits for capacity building (around CFAF 31 billion in total).
1

The DSA has been produced jointly by World Bank and Fund staffs in consultation with the staff of the
African Development Bank. The fiscal year for Chad is January through December.
2
The last DSA was submitted to the Boards of the WB and IMF on December 11, 2006. It can be found in the
Chad section of the IMF public website, www.imf.org., among the papers published in January 2007 for the
2006 Article IV Consultation.

2

2.
Chad’s debt management is guided by the framework adopted in March 2007 by the
Economic and Monetary Community of Central Africa (CEMAC) to which it belongs. 3
In that context, Chad’s debt management capacity has been significantly strengthened. A new
software introduced in 2008 permits the integration of domestic and external debt. It will also
be used to publish a new statistical bulletin, and the debt department is planning its own
website. Starting 2009, to get a better grip on treasury arrears (arrierés comptables) any
unpaid bills at the end of the complementary period of the budget year will be formally
recognized as debt and transferred to the debt department.
External debt relief—HIPC Initiative and MDRI
3.
Chad is eligible for the enhanced Heavily-Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) Initiative.
The decision point was reached on May 24, 2001, and HIPC Initiative debt relief was
estimated at US$170 million in 2001 NPV terms (of which US$68 million by IDA and
US$18 million by the IMF). Part was to be delivered as interim assistance with the remainder
at the completion point. Creditors delivering interim assistance to Chad include IDA, IMF,
AfDB, the Paris Club, and other bilateral creditors. However, in the seven years that elapsed,
most creditors have reached the limit of their interim relief (the IMF in 2005, the AfDB in
2006 and IDA in 2007). 4
4.
Macroeconomic performance and political obstacles have prevented Chad from
reaching the HIPC Initiative completion point. Specifically, Chad’s inability to meet agreed
fiscal targets and satisfactorily implement a program under the IMF’s Poverty Reduction and
Growth Facility (PRGF)—a key completion point trigger—has been the principal obstacle.
The 2005 PRGF expired in 2008 without any reviews being concluded. Subsequent efforts in
2008 to develop a policy track record to a new PRGF through a Staff-Monitored Program
were derailed by further fiscal slippages. The timing of the completion point will depend on
the authorities’ efforts to progress to a new PRGF arrangement, and satisfactory performance
under the PRGF-supported program. Besides this, the completion point requires one year
satisfactory implementation of the Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP), and meeting a
number of floating completion point triggers in governance and five Priority sectors. 5 The
Government of Chad adopted a new PRSP in April 2008.

5.
Upon reaching the HIPC Initiative completion point, Chad would also become
eligible for debt relief under the Multilateral Debt Relief Initiative (MDRI). MDRI relief
covers the full stock of debt owed to three multilateral creditors, IDA, IMF, and the African
Development Fund (AfDF) that remains at the time of the completion point on disbursements
before end-2004 in the case of IMF and AfDF and before end-2003 in the case of IDA. For
Chad, MDRI debt relief would be equivalent to approximately US$1 billion in nominal terms
over 45 years or US$567 million in end-2006 NPV terms.
Public domestic debt
6.
Chad has no public domestic debt instruments. CEMAC plans for creating a domestic
securities market have been slow in coming to fruition. Nonetheless Chad has a stock of
domestic debt resulting from past arrears. Building on the work of several government debt
commissions, an independent auditor identified in 2006 claims worth CFA 142 billion
(4.6 percent of GDP) as of end-2005, to be paid either immediately or upon further
verification. The debt is reported in three categories: treasury arrears (arrierés comptables),
from the current or previous budget years; rescheduled debt (debt conventionnées); and legal
obligations (engagements juridiques) (see Text Table 2).
7.
Since 2005, public domestic debt has fallen as a result of repayments even though
new debts were added. All domestic debt is in national currency. Only a small portion of the
rescheduled debt earns interest. The authorities view settlement of all verified arrears and
debts as an opportunity to improve the public sector’s credit standing and increase private
sector confidence. A partial domestic debt repayment plan envisaging payment of
CFAF 40 billion over 2008-10 was adopted in April 2008. In July 2008, a government
commission started to update the stock of debt as of end-2007 and complete the necessary
verification to enable the government to adopt a final arrears clearance and domestic debt
settlement plan in early 2009. No public debt guarantees are registered in the debt
department.

UNDERLYING DSA ASSUMPTIONS

8.
Over the 20 year period covered by the DSA, Chad’s macroeconomic performance
will be much affected by the gradual depletion of its current oil resources and the policy
reactions to its economic implications. The basic macroeconomic assumptions underlying the
baseline scenario are summarized in Text Table 3.

Oil is a critical determinant of Chad’s economic outlook. While exploration is
ongoing, Chad’s “proved” oil reserves have not changed since the commencement of
production in the Doba field. To be conservative, no new discoveries have been factored in.
Long-term oil production projections are therefore based on the gradual depletion of the
Doba field, with annual production declining from 46 million barrels in 2008 to 11 million in
2028. Due to its quality, Chad’s oil sells at a discount of $10-15 per barrel relative to
international reference prices such as Brent. For the medium term, the base line assumes the
reference oil price behaves in line with the latest IMF projections used for the World
Economic Outlook; for the long term, the baseline assumes oil prices will trend in real terms
towards the price level attained in 2006 of about $60 per barrel.6 For the outer years oil
revenue—the government “take”—is assumed to be 50 percent of gross oil revenues.
10.
As oil production trends down, non-oil real growth is assumed to pick up to
4-5 percent, resulting in overall GDP growth of 3-4 percent. This economic diversification
will have benefited from the productivity-enhancing investments in human and physical
infrastructure financed with the oil revenues. But it is also predicated on a general
improvement in the private sector business climate. The balance of payments reflects these
trends with growing non-oil exports gradually substituting for declining oil exports.
____________________

This is the International Energy Agency’s projection for oil prices 20 years ahead in its 2007 World Energy
Outlook.

6
11.
The assumed fiscal policy reaction to the decline in oil revenues is a combination of
adjustment—reducing expenditures—and financing—raising revenues through the
broad-based taxation of the growing non-oil sectors, targeting a non-oil primary deficit of
below 4 percent which a permanent income analysis suggests would be sustainable. It is
highly preferable that this adjustment comes about through a forward-looking medium-term
budget policy that respects the government’s anti-poverty objectives. If not, then a more
costly adjustment will be forced by the inevitable decline in oil revenue absent other
financing possibilities.
12.
Assumed in the baseline is that Chad, currently one of the ten poorest countries in the
world, will remain over the projection period, an IDA-eligible country. It should therefore
continue to receive external financial support through project and program grants and loans
on a concessional basis. Presently total grants and loans are at an unusually low level: in
terms of GDP, the 2007 level was only half that of 2004. As oil revenue declines and Chad
improves its governance and relations with development partners, this level is projected to
pick up somewhat. Of new borrowing, 70 percent is assumed to have a grant element of
around 60 percent (IDA terms) and 30 percent a grant element of 35 percent. The combined
effect of the grants and concessional borrowing is to raise the grant-equivalent financing to
3.6 percent of GDP in the outer years. Following the settlement of current domestic debt by
2010, a small build-up of new debt is projected, in line with CEMAC plans for stimulating
domestic government securities. In the absence of a PRGF arrangement, there is no target
date for the HIPC completion point, and the baseline therefore does not take into account
possible debt relief.
III.

EXTERNAL DSA
A.

Baseline

13.
A standard component of a LIC DSA is to assess the external debt burden indicators
in relation to policy-dependent thresholds because of the key empirical finding that LICs
with better quality policies and institutions can sustain a higher level of external debt. Policy
performance is classified as strong, medium and weak depending on the country’s rating on
the World Bank’s Country Policy and Institutional Assessment (CPIA). Chad’s rating is very
low, 2.77 on average for 2005-07, which puts it in the Weak Policy category. Moreover,
Chad’s CPIA declined from 2.9 in 2005 to 2.6 in 2007.7 The corresponding thresholds
together with Chad’s performance under the baseline are shown in Text Table 4; the debt
ratios are in present value (PV) terms. Under the baseline scenario the indicators of Chad’s
public- and publicly-guaranteed debt are always comfortably below the threshold values.
Moreover, the ratios are either stable or declining, suggesting the outlook is favorable.

Alternative Scenarios and Stress Tests

14.
The LIC DSA template subjects the baseline external debt projections to a number of
standard stress tests, namely two alternative scenarios and six bound tests (see Table 2a). The
charts in Figure 1 show how the ratios behave under the baseline and the most extreme of the
stress tests relative to the thresholds. The alternative “historical” scenario assumes key
variables stay at their historical averages. In Chad’s case this implies that the fairly large
current account deficits of the past—on account of oil sector imports—continue, financed
mostly by large foreign direct investment inflows, but still generating a debt build up. As a
result in Figure 1, panel c the historical ratio crosses the performance-based threshold. Given
that larger current account deficits could derive from several factors, including lower oil
prices, this scenario indicates the sensitivity of the baseline to balance of payments shocks.
15.
Five of the six standard bound tests involve “shocking” key variables in the first two
years of the projection period by setting them one standard deviation below their historical
average. The sixth test assumes a 30 percent depreciation in the first year only. The charts
show the test yielding the most extreme result, that is, the highest ratio, in 2018. In two
instances (Figure 1, panels c and e) this turns out to be “export growth,” and in three
instances (Figure 1, panels b, d, and f) the “depreciation” test. For two of the five ratios the
extreme bound tests cross the thresholds (see Figure 1, panels c and d). For the PV of
debt-to-exports ratio under the “export growth” test this reflects the high historical volatility
of Chad’s exports due to the coming on stream of oil production in 2003. The test assumes
minus 40 percent export growth in 2009 and 2010. This shock is severe but not impossible
given the extreme oil price volatility to which Chad is subject (e.g., the price Chad fetched
for its oil at end-2008 was 60 percent below the peak price of July 2008).

8
IV.
A.

PUBLIC DSA
Baseline

16.
All of Chad’s external debt is public debt, and domestic public debt is limited. The
baseline assumes repayment of the current stock of domestic debt by 2010, followed by a
small build-up of domestic debt (CFAF 5 billion per year) over the projection period as a
market for domestic securities is developed. Growth in non-oil revenue compensates for the
loss in oil revenue. On those assumptions, the analysis of the sustainability of public debt
under the baseline confirms broadly the conclusion of the previous analysis that Chad’s debt
outlook is favorable (see Figure 2). Peaking in 2009 due to the sudden sharp drop in revenue,
the three ratios show a slight steady decline over the projection period.
B.

Alternative Scenarios and Stress Tests

17.
In the LIC DSA, the baseline public debt projections are subjected to three scenarios
and five bound tests (see Table 2b). Figure 2 compares the ratios under these scenarios with
the baseline. As in the case of external debt, the “historical” scenario sets key variables at
their historical average. Under this scenario Chad will incur primary deficits over the
projection period, which generate additional debt, rather than the surpluses of the baseline.8
The result is a significant deterioration in all three ratios relative to the baseline over the long
term. The “historical” scenario indicates how sensitive the baseline is to the assumption that
growing non-oil revenue will compensate for declining oil revenue. Under the scenario “fix
primary balance” the unusually large primary surplus of 2008 continues and as a result all
debt is repaid rapidly.
18.
The most extreme bound test is the “lower long-run GDP growth,” which assumes
lower real GDP growth over the full projection period. For 2009-28 it implies an average
growth rate of 1.4 percent compared to 3.6 percent under the baseline. Under this test, the
three ratios move rapidly away from the baseline, with PV of debt-to-GDP reaching
100 percent in the outer years. The 1.4 percent rate is actually quite close to the overall real
GDP growth rate that would result if non-oil GDP growth did not accelerate as assumed
under the baseline to 4.8 percent per year but stayed at 3.6 percent, the rate achieved over
1988-97, the decade preceding the development of the oil sector. That lower non-oil GDP
growth rate, in combination with the decline in oil GDP, would result in overall real GDP
growth for 2009-28 of 1.3 percent per year on average. Hence, the worrisome trends of this
bound test expose the sensitivity of the baseline to the non-oil growth assumption.
_______________________
8

The baseline projects primary surpluses of 1.5 percent of GDP over 2008-13, thanks to oil revenue, whereas
the “historical” scenario assumes deficits of 1.1 percent of GDP over 2008-13. In Table 2b a negative number in
the line for “primary deficit” amounts to a surplus.

9
V. DEBT DISTRESS CLASSIFICATION AND CONCLUSIONS
19.
In the staff’s view Chad should be considered at moderate risk of debt distress based
on external debt burden indicators. The inclusion of domestic debt does not alter the
assessment of Chad’s risk of debt distress. This assessment, “moderate risk,” is justified by
the fact that while the baseline scenario does not indicate a breach of thresholds, the
“historical” scenario does and so do two of the bound tests. It is further justified by the fact
that the conduct of economic policy and debt management imply sizeable risks to the
baseline.
20.
This assessment of Chad’s debt situation is an improvement over the one in 2006. At
that time, staff judged Chad’s debt outlook to be fragile and the risk of debt distress high.
Prudent debt management and a more favorable balance of payments outlook account for this
improvement.
21.
An important risk borne out by the DSA is that a shock emanating from the external
sector could well push the ratios over the threshold. But probably the most important
long-term risk highlighted by the DSA is that non-oil GDP growth may stagnate at the low
rate prior to the advent of the oil era. The challenge is to use oil revenues effectively to
enhance the economy’s productive capacity, through efficient investments in human and
physical infrastructure, accompanied by structural reforms that improve governance and the
business climate. If the government fails to meet this challenge, it would thwart the baseline
strategy to offset decreasing oil export proceeds by increasing non-oil exports, and
decreasing government oil revenue by increasing non-oil revenue.
22.
As at the time of the 2006 DSA, there is a considerable risk that fiscal discipline will
not prevail in the near term, possibly leading to the accumulation of new domestic arrears.
Another risk is the temptation for the government to assume large debts in connection with
oil ventures, possibly collateralized against future oil income and on non-concessional terms.
On the other hand, Chad’s debt outlook could improve if the ongoing exploration results in
new significant oil or mineral discoveries. Finally, attainment of the HIPC Initiative
completion point would ensure debt sustainability even under more adverse circumstances.

Includes both public and private sector external debt.
Derived as [r - g - r(1+g)]/(1+g+r+gr) times previous period debt ratio, with r = nominal interest rate; g = real GDP growth rate, and r = growth rate of GDP deflator in U.S. dollar terms.
Includes exceptional financing (i.e., changes in arrears and debt relief); changes in gross foreign assets; and valuation adjustments. For projections also includes contribution from price and exchange rate changes.
Assumes that PV of private sector debt is equivalent to its face value.
Current-year interest payments divided by previous period debt stock.
Historical averages and standard deviations are generally derived over the past 10 years, subject to data availability.
Defined as grants, concessional loans, and debt relief.
Grant-equivalent financing includes grants provided directly to the government and through new borrowing (difference between the face value and the PV of new debt).

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
January 30, 2009

International Monetary Fund

Washington, D. C. 20431 USA

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2008 Article IV Consultation with Chad
On January 28, 2009, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded
the Article IV consultation with Chad. 1
Background
Chad is one of poorest countries in the world. It is landlocked and wracked by conflict and
political instability. Its main economic challenge is to seize the opportunity offered by oil
revenues to boost growth, diversify the economy and reduce poverty. The second poverty
reduction strategy paper (PRSP) adopted in 2008, sets out an economic strategy through 2011
which includes good governance and an environment conducive to growth as its main
objectives.
Economic developments since the late 1990s have been dominated by the lead up to, and
onset of, oil production in 2003, with sharp fluctuations in overall growth related to the oil sector.
Growth has been sluggish in 2007 and 2008 due to weak non-oil growth and declines in oil
production. A very difficult security situation has weakened economic activity. Real GDP in 2008
is expected to decline by ½ percent because of a further drop in oil production and the impact of
the 2008 February rebel attack on economic activity over the first half of the year. After falling
prices in 2007, inflationary pressures picked up in the first half of 2008 owing to rising food
prices, reaching 11¾ percent on a 12-month basis at end-November 2008. Steadily increasing
oil prices through mid-2008 have helped strengthen the external current account and official
reserves. Import cover is expected to rise to 10½ months of imports of non-oil goods and
1

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On
return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the
Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the
Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the
country's authorities.

services in 2008, from 5¼ months in 2006. However, the global economic crisis will seriously
affect Chad through lower oil prices, with major implications on the fiscal position.
The fiscal position has weakened significantly over the oil era. The non-oil primary deficit
deteriorated from 4 percent of non-oil GDP in 2004—the onset of oil revenues—to an expected
28 percent (commitment basis) in 2008. This mainly derives from higher spending in all areas,
but particularly in security and investment spending. Fiscal management has also been
problematic, with weak budget control manifested as bypassing of budget procedures,
extrabudgetary spending, and limited medium-term planning. Problems have also been
highlighted over absorptive capacity in some sectors, and over the composition, cost, and
quality of public spending.
As a member of the CFA franc zone, Chad has no independent monetary policy. Broad money
and private sector credit have been growing rapidly in 2008, driven by the build up of reserves.
The banking system is subject to some vulnerabilities, stemming from its lack of depth, some
undercapitalization, and the need to strengthen supervision. The fixed exchange regime has
provided an important nominal anchor for macroeconomic policies. However, the real exchange
has appreciated significantly (25 percent) since 2000, even though it depreciated over 2007-08.
The 2005-2008 PRGF arrangement went off track due to widening non-oil fiscal deficits,
inadequate poverty orientation of spending, and slow structural reform. The decision point under
the HIPC Initiative was reached in May 2001, and significant interim debt relief has been
provided since.
Executive Board Assessment
Directors emphasized the opportunities offered by Chad’s oil revenue to address the country’s
widespread poverty. They noted, however, that non-oil sector activity remains weak, despite
increased budgetary allocations to infrastructure and other priority sectors. Improvements in the
security environment, infrastructure and human capital, and the business climate will be
essential to lay the basis for sustainable growth. Directors noted that inflation is expected to
decline with an unwinding of the food price shock, but called for vigilance to ensure a rapid
return to the inflation target established by the Central African Economic and Monetary
Community.
Directors expressed concern over the large recent increases in the non-oil fiscal deficit, and
encouraged the authorities to improve long-run fiscal sustainability through a concerted
medium-term fiscal adjustment effort. They strongly supported the authorities’ fiscal strategy
built on improving public financial management, raising non-oil revenues, and improving the
targeting and efficiency of spending. A permanent income framework that relates fiscal policy to
Chad’s oil wealth, reducing the impact of short-term oil price volatility, will provide an
appropriate anchor for Chad. At the same time, Directors recognized that the fiscal adjustment
path should take into account the country’s large investment needs while being consistent with
absorptive capacity and financing constraints.

3

Directors commended the authorities for signaling their commitment to fiscal adjustment with
the 2009 budget, but called for stronger efforts. The current budget is exposed to considerable
risks, notably the optimistic oil price assumptions and dependence on large reductions in
security spending, which could lead to financing gaps in the course of the year. Directors
therefore noted the importance of issuing a revised budget premised on realistic oil revenues
and entailing stronger efforts to begin streamlining non-security outlays—such as the wage bill
and transfers to inefficient state-owned enterprises—that have grown rapidly over recent years.
Directors highlighted the critical importance of improving fiscal management to achieve
medium-term fiscal policy objectives, improve the quality of public spending, and eliminate
budgetary overruns. Efforts are also required to strengthen medium-term budgeting, cash
management, and procurement, and to enhance the role of line ministries in budget formulation
and execution—supported by further technical assistance. In this context, Directors commended
the authorities for starting to clear domestic arrears.
Directors expected Chad’s early participation in the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative,
building on its transparent oil revenue collection regime. The authorities should work closely
with the Fund and other partners in designing a new permanent oil revenue management
mechanism.
Directors observed that, although the real exchange rate has appreciated significantly since the
beginning of the decade, it does not appear inconsistent with external stability. As oil production
becomes more established, it will be important to monitor developments in the prices of nontraded goods. Directors stressed the critical importance of improved infrastructure—particularly
through reductions in transport and energy costs—as well as of strengthened governance,
financial sector development, and other structural reforms in order to enhance productivity and
competitiveness, and boost Chad’s weak export performance.
Directors noted that the oil windfall combined with prudent debt management has improved the
debt situation since the last Article IV consultation. Although the risk of debt distress is now
moderate, lower exports and growth remain important risks. Directors therefore welcomed the
intention to improve debt sustainability and take all actions to attain the HIPC Initiative
completion point as soon as possible, including by strengthening Chad’s relationship with key
partners. Several Directors encouraged the authorities to refrain from non-concessional
borrowing.
Directors noted the authorities’ interest in a staff-monitored program. They encouraged the
authorities to demonstrate the improvements in fiscal policy and management in 2009 to
proceed towards such a program as quickly as possible.
Directors emphasized that the serious shortcomings in Chad’s macroeconomic statistics
undermine effective surveillance. The authorities should provide adequate resources to the
National Statistics Institute, supported by further technical assistance in priority areas.

Statement by Laurean W. Rutayisire, Executive Director for Chad
January 28, 2009
1.
We are thankful to Management and the staff for the fruitful policy dialogue they
have maintained with the Chadian authorities. Against the backdrop of declining oil
production over the past few years, the Chadian authorities have been able to make
progress toward achievement of their policy objectives. The overall fiscal surplus in
percent of non-oil GDP is estimated to have increased threefold between 2007 and 2008,
as oil revenue augmented and the increase in total expenditures in percent of non-oil GDP
were maintained significantly below that of total revenue. The authorities also increased
the level of priority expenditures, notably on education and health. International reserves
remain at healthy levels although they have been affected by the decline in oil prices.
Between 2006 and 2008, gross official reserves are estimated to have doubled, reaching
about 10 ½ months of imports of non-oil goods and services.
2.
However, the difficult security situation which prevailed early last year has had a
big toll on recent economic performance and non-oil primary balance. As a result of its
adverse impact on non-oil GDP and the decline in oil production, real GDP growth has
remained low. The non-oil primary deficit increased, partly reflecting higher priority
spending. Inflation picked up sharply at the onset of the recent food price shock. This
shock prompted the authorities to take a number of temporary measures aimed at
mitigating the adverse impact, ranging from tax relief to temporary export suspension and
assistance to low-income public sector workers. In order to mitigate inflationary
pressures, the regional central bank, BEAC, adopted a tighter monetary stance notably
through the imposition of higher reserve requirements and policy rates.
3.
The authorities continue to attach high value to compliance with the convergence
criteria set forth by the CEMAC. All primary criteria but the one related to annual
inflation were met. It is noteworthy that in the absence of shocks, inflation is forecast to
return to a level consistent with the CEMAC criterion over the medium-term.
Economic Outlook and Policy and Reform Agenda
4.
Non-oil GDP growth is expected to rebound starting from 2009, fueled by
construction, service, and manufacturing. As a result of lower production, oil GDP is
expected to continue to decline this year—albeit at a much slower pace. As noted above,
inflation is forecasted to drop sharply this year and to be subdued going forward, barring
unexpected shocks.
5.
As stressed in the second PRSP, the authorities remain committed to preserving
fiscal sustainability, improving public financial management, and making effective use of
oil revenue while laying the foundations for sustained growth. The 2009 budget mirrors
the authorities’ determination to preserve fiscal sustainability, notably by programming a
reduction in the non-oil primary deficit of about 7 percentage points of non-oil GDP. The

2
authorities will be closely monitoring budget execution and are prepared to take
corrective actions that may be warranted. In particular, they intend to revise the budget
around mid-2009 in the event oil prices remain out of line with their projections.
6.
Going forward, the authorities remain determined to implement sound fiscal
policy. In support of their efforts to boost non-oil revenues, the authorities will benefit
from Fund technical assistance in the areas of tax and customs administration. We thus
call on Management to approve the request they have formulated in this regard. With
regard to oil revenues, the authorities remain committed to their effective use, notably
with the aim at diversifying the economy. They plan to carry out a comprehensive review
of the oil fiscal regime and work is underway to enhance monitoring of oil revenue
collection.
7.
The authorities will continue to strengthen public financial management, building
on recent improvements in the budget framework aimed notably at preventing
extrabudgetary spending and at better monitoring capital expenditures. In this endeavor,
my Chadian authorities request donor assistance in support of their action plan to
modernize public financial management (PAMFIP).
8.
Chad’s economy has not yet been affected by the current global financial turmoil
and economic slowdown. However, this could change should the financial crisis affect
indirectly domestic banks, and oil prices continue to decline and remain low for a
sustained period of time. At this current juncture, most financial sector soundness
indicators in Chad remain strong. In particular, the banking system continues to perform
well, with highly profitable banks, improving asset quality ratios of nonperforming loans
to banking loans, and adequate liquidity. Nevertheless, in recognition of the ample scope
for further developing Chad’s financial system, the authorities are determined to take
steps to strengthen the system and improve credit access. In particular, the new
microfinance strategy is meant to serve these purposes.
9.
On the structural front, the authorities will pursue their reform agenda for large
state-owned enterprises such as the cotton company, Cottontchad, and the water and
electricity company, STEE, which aims, in particular, to improve the efficiency of their
operations and reduce their fiscal costs. They have launched a financial and technical
audit of Cottontchad which will help determine the restructuring needs of the company
and the roadmap for the reform of the cotton sector. A restructuring of STEE is also
envisaged that entails notably the breakup of the company into two distinct water and
electricity entities.
10.
The authorities will continue to exercise prudence in managing public debt. They
are determined to safeguard public debt sustainability and make progress toward HIPC
completion point. With regard to domestic debt, the authorities have resumed last year

3
clearance of domestic arrears and are intent on continuing to make further progress on
this front.
11.
In conclusion, it is noteworthy that weak capacities and a fragile security situation
have been among the key sources of the policy challenges facing the Chadian authorities
over the past years, particularly on the fiscal front. In addressing these challenges, the
authorities will welcome donor assistance and Fund advice in particular. Fund assistance
to members under similar circumstances is proven to have added significant value. In this
connection, it is our view that the authorities will benefit greatly from close collaboration
with the Fund, especially in a program context. The authorities continue to express their
interest in an SMP with a view to facilitating access to a new PRGF arrangement. We
thus call on Management and staff to consider favorably the authorities’ request for an
SMP and to lay the foundations for a quick start of the implementation of such a
program.
