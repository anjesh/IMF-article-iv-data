STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2013 ARTICLE IV CONSULTATION
July 17, 2013

KEY ISSUES
Context: The Norwegian economy continues to perform well with mainland (i.e., non-oil)
GDP growing steadily at 2½–3 percent, low and stable unemployment at 3–3½ percent,
and core inflation running well below the 2.5 percent target. However, the continuing
buildup of assets in the sovereign wealth fund and the increasing share of the mainland
economy that is supplying goods and services to the oil sector are leading to
competitiveness pressures in other industries exposed to international competition. Other
risks to the economy relate mostly to a continuing housing boom and a large drop in oil
prices.
Fiscal policy: Norway’s fiscal institutions were designed to smooth spending from the oil
wealth and insulate the economy from Dutch disease. However, high oil prices have led to
steady rise in the fiscal impulse and the share of the mainland economy that is providing
supplies and services is increasing. The authorities should use the flexibility that they have
to reduce the rate of fiscal transfer from the sovereign wealth fund to the budget to lessen
the pressures on traditional industries.
Monetary policy: With inflation well below the 2.5 percent target, the authorities have
held the policy rate at 1.5 percent. The current stance is appropriate in balancing the
below-target inflation for an economy near potential. Overheating in property markets
should be addressed through financial sector policies.
Financial sector policy: The authorities’ plans to increase capital buffers even more
rapidly than required by Basel III and tighten prudential measures for mortgage lending
are good, but cooperation among the Nordic authorities is necessary for fully effective
macroprudential policy.
The Article IV discussions were coordinated with the Nordic Regional Report discussions;
the latter covers cross-border financial sector issues in the region and house prices and
household debt in a cross-country context.

RECENT DEVELOPMENTS
A. Macroeconomic Setting
Real GDP Growth
(Percent)

1.
The Norwegian economy continues to grow
steadily (Figures 1 and 2). Norway’s real GDP grew at 3
percent in 2012, with mainland and offshore (i.e., oil and gas)
activities growing at 3.3 percent and 1.8 percent, respectively.1
Mainland growth has been driven by private consumption and
investment, supported by rising house prices and low interest
rates. More recent data confirms that the robust growth
continued in the first quarter of 2013, supported by steady
private consumption growth.
2.
Despite strong domestic demand, inflation
remains subdued (Figure 3). Headline CPI inflation and
inflation excluding energy products and tax changes
(CPI-ATE) have been running at 2.0 percent and 1.4 percent,
respectively, well below the authorities’ target as of May
2013.2 Inflation has been held down mostly by declining
import prices in the face of an appreciating exchange rate;
inflation in imported consumer goods has been negative
for the past year while inflation in domestic goods has been
running at close to 2.5 percent.

3.
The buoyant domestic economy has supported employment (Figure 4). The
unemployment rate remains at around 3–3 ½ percent, although the participation rate is still below
pre-crisis peak levels. Wage growth has been strong in past years, but the recent bargaining
agreement for 2013 resulted in an average annual wage increase of 3.4 percent in nominal terms for
unionized industry and service workers in the private sector, a somewhat lower level than in 2012.

1

Norway’s offshore sector produces oil, natural gas, and other hydrocarbons, but the term “oil” is used as shorthand
for all hydrocarbons in the balance of this report.
2

The authorities have an inflation-targeting rule with a 2.5 percent target for consumer price inflation; stabilization of
output and employment are also included in the rule but as subordinate objectives (see Box 1).

Box 1. The Fiscal and Monetary Policy Rules
Norway introduced policy rules in 2001 that set quantitative targets for fiscal and monetary policy. The rules
provide for some flexibility and judgment in both cases to take into account the business cycle in the case of
the fiscal rule and output and employment stabilization in the case of the monetary policy rule.
The Fiscal Policy Rule—The fiscal policy rule provides that: “Fiscal policy is guided by the fiscal rule,
stipulating a gradual phasing-in of oil revenues in the Norwegian economy in line with the expected real
returns on the Government Pension Fund Global, estimated at 4 pct. The fiscal rule permits spending more
than the expected return on the Fund in a cyclical downturn, while the use of oil revenues should lie below
the expected return when capacity utilisation in the economy is high.”

1/

The fiscal policy rule constrains the non-oil deficit as a share of GPFG assets, but not as a share of GDP. To
the extent that the GPFG grows more rapidly than the economy as a whole over an extended period, the rule
permits a trend increase in the non-oil deficit as a share of GDP. Should GPFG assets decline relative to GDP,
the reverse would be true. The fiscal implications of the rule are also sensitive to the real rate-of-return
assumption. Real returns over the brief life of the fund have not generally met the 4 percent assumption,
and there is no automatic mechanism to recalibrate the rate-of-return assumption to experience.
The Inflation Targeting Rule—The price stability mandate of the Norges Bank provides that: “Monetary
policy shall be aimed at stability in the Norwegian krone's national and international value, contributing to
stable expectations concerning exchange rate developments. At the same time, monetary policy shall
underpin fiscal policy by contributing to stable developments in output and employment.” It also provides
that: “The operational target of monetary policy shall be annual consumer price inflation of approximately
2.5 per cent over time.” It also indicates how inflation should be measured in some detail: “In general, the
direct effects on consumer prices resulting from changes in interest rates, taxes, excise duties and
extraordinary temporary disturbances shall not be taken into account.” 2/
In practice, Norges Bank sets an interest rate path to maintain inflation close to 2.5 percent following the
three criteria: (i) the inflation target is achieved; (ii) the inflation targeting regime is flexible; and
(iii) monetary policy is robust. The first weighs on the current level of inflation. The second criterion gives
weight to avoiding excessive fluctuations in output and employment. The last criterion seeks to mitigate the
risk of a build-up of financial imbalances so that acceptable developments in inflation and output are also
likely under alternative assumptions about the economy. 3/

The 2012 fiscal outturn was in line with the authorities’ fiscal policy rule. The fiscal rule
limits the structural non-oil deficit to the expected trend income from the sovereign wealth fund, at

5.
Norway’s overall fiscal position continues to be
strong. The general government surplus was about
14 percent of GDP in 2012. The value of GPFG also grew
substantially in 2012 to 173 percent of mainland GDP.
6.
The overall current account remains in surplus,
supported by favorable terms of trade developments
(Figure 5). The overall current account surplus rose
to 19 percent of mainland GDP in 2012, reflecting robust
oil demand and high oil prices. However, the non-oil trade
balance worsened slightly in 2012, reflecting in part
weaker external demand and recent exchange rate
appreciation. More generally, non-oil exports have lost
market share over the past two decades, raising
competitiveness concerns.
7.
The exchange rate appears to be broadly in
line with fundamentals. The real effective exchange rate
(REER) based on the CPI is only slightly above the 10-year
historical average at end-2012. Results from External
Balance Assessment (EBA) are mixed, with the three
methods pointing to different directions. These results
suggest that there is no obvious sign of misalignment as
far as REER-CPI is concerned.

The authorities’ fiscal policy rule limits the non-oil deficit to the average income from its sovereign wealth fund—
the Government Pension Fund—Global (GPFG)—at an assumed real rate of return of 4 percent to help ensure “high
capacity utilization and low unemployment” (see Box 2).

Box 2. Government Pension Fund Global
Norway’s sovereign wealth fund, the (somewhat misleadingly-named) Government Pension Fund
Global – is believed to be the world’s largest or second largest such fund with total assets of
$713 billion at end–2012. The GPFG serves variously as a vehicle for investment or resource income for
future generations, a source of fiscal financing for the non-oil fiscal deficit according to Norway’s fiscal
rule (see Box 1), and as a means of insulating the economy from “Dutch disease.” Notwithstanding its
name, there is no direct connection between the GPFG and the state’s pension obligations.
History and governance—The governance of the GPFG partially insulates decisions about the
investment of oil income from political considerations. Oil production in Norway began in 1971, and
revenues from oil and gas were treated as fiscal ordinary revenue in the first decades of production.
The authorities adopted a new structure in 1990, establishing the GPFG under the ownership of the
government through the Ministry of Finance but managed by the Norges Bank. The Ministry sets the
investment strategy and broad asset allocations, but delegates the actual investment management to
the Norges Bank which is charged with achieving the highest possibly return, subject to the limitations
included in the investment strategy. The government also has guidelines to incorporate good
corporate governance and environmental and social concerns (e.g., creating an investment reservation
for “environment-related investments” on the order of 1 percent of the portfolio), and also to preclude
investment in firms engaged in certain activities (e.g., tobacco and nuclear weapons production). An
independent Council on Ethics advises the Ministry on the exclusion of specific firms.
Investment strategy—The value of the GPFG has grown rapidly on the strength of rising oil and gas
prices and increased production over the last two decades. The first transfers to the fund took place
in 1996 and assets were originally invested in a manner similar to central bank reserves. However, the
investment strategy rapidly evolved into something like a diversified global index fund with target
allocations of equities and fixed-income securities (and more recently real estate) across geographic
regions.
Income and “Dutch Disease”—The GPFG receives all of the government’s oil- and gas-related
income, including taxes, ownership shares, and the state’s dividends from the majority governmentowned Statoil. The transfers to the budget are not related to the inflows of oil- and gas-income but
instead to the value of the fund’s assets. As the stock of assets in the GFPG grows relative to the
inflows of new funds, the income from the GPFG will be influenced more and more by global asset
returns and less and less by oil prices or production volumes. Nevertheless, the indirect effects of oil
and gas production through employment and investment in oil production firms and the trend
increase in the non-oil deficit resulting from the fiscal rule both tend to create a real appreciation and a
loss of competitiveness.

However, the overall strength of the mainland economy masks divergent trends. A
strong and growing set of industries supplying goods and services to the offshore sector coexists
with a non-oil-related subset of the mainland economy under increasing cost and competitiveness
pressures. Indicators that distinguish between the oil-related (e.g., engineering industries) and other
parts of the mainland economy show strong growth in the output of the former with stagnant
output in the non-oil-related mainland economy. The divergence is also evident in cost pressures in
the context of rapidly rising unit labor costs; while the oil-related parts of the mainland economy
have had a falling wage share of value added over the last decade, the traditional industries that are
exposed to international competition have seen the wage share rise by roughly 20 percentage
points over the same period.4

Norway’s ULC-based real effective exchange rate gives a very different picture of
competitiveness, suggesting an erosion of long-term cost competitiveness. Reflecting strong
wage growth, the ULC-based REER appreciated by 60 percent over the past decade, and it is

significantly above its 30-year average. At the same time, the market share of Norway’s non-oil
exports have dropped substantially for the past two decades. The loss of non-oil market share is
largely explained by the decline in manufacturing exports, which lost almost 60 percent of its market
share during the same period (Figure 6).

B. Housing Markets and Financial Sector
10.
The housing boom continues raising
overheating concerns (Box 3 and Figures 7, 8, and 9).
Real house prices increased by almost 6 percent in 2012,
and household debt remains elevated at about 200
percent of disposable income. Household credit
continues to grow steadily. While rising house prices are
supported by high income growth, increasing
population due to immigration, low interest rates and
supply constraints, some households are highly
indebted and vulnerable to a possible house price
reversal.

11.
Financial sector balance sheets are improving
and the funding structure of banks has improved, but financial institutions are vulnerable to
property price reversals (Figures 10 and 11.) Banks have improved their resilience by raising capital
and are in the process of strengthening their capital further. Common Equity Tier 1 (CET1) capital
ratio reached 11 percent in 2012. Norway’s largest bank (DNB) had earlier fallen short of a 9 percent
CET1 ratio recommended by European Banking Authority (EBA), but the recommendation was met
as of June 2012 by using internal resources. Banks continue to rely on wholesale funding, but the
funding structure has become more robust recently; funding maturities have risen, and banks are
increasingly matching short-term wholesale funding with liquid assets. Nevertheless, banks could be
vulnerable in the event of a large property price correction or an interest rate shock given the high
level of household debt and banks’ credit exposure to the commercial property market.

Staff‘s estimates of house price valuation gaps based on an average of three methods, including a timeseries model consistent with IMF’s Vulnerability Exercise, indicates that house prices in Norway may be
overvalued by about 40 percent. While this estimate is subject to considerable uncertainty, a large house
price correction could significantly impact the economy, dampening consumption and residential
investment. The negative impact could be significant given the high level of household debt and the fact
that a certain segment of households is heavily indebted with debt to income ratio higher than 5 (see
Chapter 2 of the Selected Issues paper).
The authorities are gradually adopting measures to cool the housing market, including tighter
macroprudential guidelines. The FSA lowered the cap on the loan-to-value (LTV) ratio on mortgages to
85 percent in December 2011, along with other tightening measures. The LTV guideline is not legally
binding, but loans with LTV higher than 85 percent seem to be declining. Higher risk weights on residential
mortgages are also currently under consideration and banks have strengthened their capital significantly to
meet Basel III requirements. The government has also recently proposed an increase in taxation on nonowner occupied properties.

OUTLOOK AND RISKS
12.
Growth is likely to continue at a moderate pace. Mainland GDP growth is projected at
2.8 percent in 2013, largely supported by strong domestic demand. Growth is likely to remain
domestic-led in the near term, reflecting weak growth in major trading partners. The output gap is
estimated to be slightly positive for mainland economy, and growth is projected to rebalance
gradually as macroeconomic and macroprudential policies tighten, house price increases moderate
to a more normal pace, and external demand recovers.
13.
Inflation is expected to be below target for some time and gradually rise to the target
in the medium term, reflecting pressures from steady wage growth and a more stable
exchange rate. Staff expects inflation to return to the 2.5 percent target by 2018.
14.

Norway’s fundamentals remain strong, but the central scenario is subject to key risks.



A substantial and prolonged reduction in oil prices: This could occur if downside risks to the
global growth outlook materialize. This would undercut growth directly, through a reduction in
oil-related demand for mainland goods and services, and indirectly, through a possible
reduction in demand for housing due to confidence effects or a reversal of immigrant inflows.



A significant reduction in housing prices: Real house prices continue to increase in Norway
even as they have stabilized or declined elsewhere (Box 3). The price-to-income ratio stabilized
somewhat in 2012, but a composite indicator, based on multiple measures, suggests that
Norway’s real house prices were overvalued by about 40 percent in 2012. A house price
correction could be triggered by a reduction of oil prices or other shocks to demand or
confidence. Given the elevated level of prices and high household debt, such a decline would

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

11

NORWAY

likely reduce household consumption with adverse consequences for retail trade, construction,
commercial real estate, and lenders to those sectors.5
Re-emergence of financial stress in the euro area or slower emerging market growth:
Norway’s direct exposure to the euro area is limited, but stalled or incomplete implementation
of policy commitments by euro area countries could trigger a re-emergence of financial stress.
Norway’s export exposure to emerging markets is also relatively small, but these economies,
particularly China, drive changes in oil demand and thus oil prices in the world market. Slower
growth in the euro area or emerging markets could have negative impacts on oil prices and
demand for oil related exports.6 A re-emergence of financial stress in the euro area could also
reduce foreign funding for Norwegian banks and tighten lending conditions.



Authorities’ views
15.
The authorities broadly agreed with staff on the risk assessment but gave particular
emphasis to risks related to a protracted decline in oil prices. They see direct risks given the
increasing dependence of much of the mainland economy on providing supplies and services to the
oil sector. They also see indirect risks as a possible trigger for a house price correction, which could
further weaken private consumption and possibly undermine financial stability in light of elevated
household debt. They noted that recent policy measures such as the strengthening of bank capital
should mitigate the build-up of potential vulnerabilities.

POLICY DISCUSSIONS
Good fortune and good economic management have yielded strong economic performance, but
Norway also faces new economic challenges. Near-term prospects remain favorable, but
managing an overheating housing market will be challenging, especially in the context of high
household debt and below-target inflation.7 High wage costs are eroding competitiveness in the
traditional sector, and the mainland economy has become more exposed to oil prices as oilrelated activity in the mainland economy increased. Over the longer-term, the implementation of
the authorities’ fiscal rule might be reconsidered in light of its implication of rising non-oil
deficits, the optimism of the long-term real rate of return assumption, and a mismatch between
the timing of long-term fiscal needs and the path of fiscal financing implied by the fiscal rule.

House prices and household balance sheets are considered in Chapter 2 of the Selected Issues paper and in a
cross-country context in the Nordic Regional Report. Chapter 2 of the Selected Issues paper for the Nordic Regional
Report estimates the possible impact of a house price correction on macro variables and finds an average impact of
a house price reversal to the “equilbriium” level on consumption would be about -4 percent for Norway.
6

The IMF’s G35 model suggests that re-emergency of financial stress in the euro area would imply a simulated peak
output loss of 0.6 percent for Norway relative to the baseline.

Box 4. Authorities’ Response to Past IMF Policy Recommendations
The authorities’ macroeconomic policies for the last eighteen months are gradually shifting toward the
direction consistent with recommendations by the Fund at the time of the last Article IV consultations.
Monetary and financial sector policies—The Norges Bank reduced the policy rate by 25 basis points
to 1.5 percent in March 2012, against the background of continuing downturn abroad and a strong
krone that were keeping inflation low and weighing on growth in Norway. The 2011 Article IV
consultation recommended monetary tightening in absence of macroprudential tightening. The FSA
lowered the cap on LTV from 90 percent to 85 percent in December 2011, together with tightening
other mortgage lending guidelines. The LTV cap remains a soft cap, but the share of new residential
mortgage loans with LTV higher than 85 percent fell in 2012.
The authorities are also gradually moving toward further macroprudential tightening. In
December 2012, the Ministry of Finance requested the FSA to review macroprudential measures to
curve the risks stemming from the overheating of housing markets. The authorities are currently
considering various proposals for raising risk weights for residential mortgage, which was one of the
last Article IV recommendations.
Tougher capital requirements are also underway. A legislative proposal on new capital requirements
for credit institutions and investment firms was put forward in March 2013 to implement the Basel III
standards (CRD IV). It is proposed that a 9 percent CET1 capital requirement become effective from July
2013, and the requirements will be gradually increased. The authorities plan to target core capital
requirements of 10 percent by July 2014. For systemically important banks, which have yet to be
defined, this target will rise to 11 percent in 2015 and 12 percent in 2016. A counter-cyclical buffer of
as much as 2.5 percent is also proposed to be effective in July 2014.
Fiscal policies—Both 2012 fiscal outturn and 2013 budget are in line with the authorities’ fiscal rule,
(i.e. below 4 percent of the GPFG capital). The 2013 revised budget also entails a small positive fiscal
impulse while the 2011 Article IV consultation recommended fiscal tightening starting from 2013.
Gradually reducing tax subsidies for housing is a long-standing Fund recommendation. The tax code
remains biased toward owner-occupied housing, but the government recently announced a proposed
tax increase for non-owner occupied houses. The tax change is small, but it is in the right direction to
reduce incentives for housing investment

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

A. Fiscal Policy
16.
The 2013 revised budget envisages a mildly expansionary fiscal stance, but still in line
with the fiscal rule. The non-oil deficit is projected to be 5.4 percent of potential mainland GDP,
less than the full 4 percent of GPFG assets, while the general government surplus is projected to be
11 percent of GDP. The fiscal impulse is projected at 0.6 percentage points in 2013.

17.
The government has implemented its fiscal rule flexibly, with a structural non-oil
deficit closer to 3 percent of GPFG assets in 2011 and 2012 and plans to do so in 2013. Because
the fiscal rule sets the transfer to the budget as a share of expected trend earnings from the GPFG, it
stabilizes the non-oil deficit relative to GPFG assets but not relative to mainland GDP. The increase in
the size of the GPFG relative to the economy implies a large and rising stimulus to the economy that
would further add to wage and cost pressures. In light of this, a continuation of the cautious fiscal
stance would reduce the extent to which fiscal policies add to competitiveness pressures coming
from the expansion of the oil-related parts of the mainland economy (see also Chapter 1 of the
Selected Issues paper).
18.
A still lower rate of spending in the 2014 budget and beyond would be appropriate in
light of the wage pressures and other competitiveness concerns. This would also support the
current monetary policy stance, which is constrained by below-target inflation and exchange rate
appreciation pressures. The government has recently proposed new tax measures to scale back the
preferential tax treatment for residential investment and increase taxation of the oil sector. While
both proposed tax changes are small, they remove some of the relative disincentive for productive
investment in the non-oil related sector of the mainland economy. At the same time, tax preferences
for owner occupied houses remain generous. The staff urged the authorities to gradually reduce
these tax preferences by lowering interest deductibility over time.
19.
Norway’s fiscal institutions, in particular the GPFG and the fiscal rule, are models for
other natural resource-exporters. The avoidance of off-budget spending or special purpose funds

14

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

NORWAY

are also critical elements of the Norwegian model. However, these institutions are not sufficient to
fully contain the pressures on competitiveness of the non-oil economy, particularly given the
increased role of the mainland economy as a supplier of goods and services to the offshore sector.
There are risks to the current approach, including the 4 percent rate of return assumption, a possible
oil price decline, and the long-run costs associated with an aging population. 8


Non-oil deficit target: Because the fiscal rule stabilizes the non-oil deficit relative to GPFG
assets but not relative to mainland GDP, the likely path of GPFG assets implies a steady widening
of non-oil fiscal deficits over the medium-term and into the next decade. This would not bode
well for competitiveness in the mainland economy. The investments of oil and gas income in the
GPFG and the expenditure rule have helped to insulate Norway from “Dutch disease” effects, but
the insulation has not been complete. Private investment and employment are increasingly
concentrated in oil-related industries in the mainland economy and non-tradable services. While
this boom in the oil-related parts of the mainland economy is good for employment and
income, it is putting the non-oil-related parts of the economy under strain. Although fiscal
policy is not the main source of these pressures of the non-oil mainland economy, it represents
the best policy instrument to address it under the current conditions.



Real rate of return assumption: The expected
real return assumption of 4 percent is too
optimistic. The average rate of return over the
life of the GPFG has been below 3.2 percent,
and experience with similar asset portfolios also
indicates that returns are likely to be lower than
4 percent (see Chapter 3 of the Selected Issues
paper).

Uncertainty about oil prices: In the event of a prolonged decline in oil prices during the
remaining years of near-peak production, the total long-run assets of the GPFG could be
considerably lower than projected. The long-run value of the fund would be lower still to the

sharply, some additional measures will be needed to contain health and aging-related
expenditure. The recent pension reform is a substantial down payment on this very tall
challenge, but it will be many years before its full impact on spending and labor force
participation is clear.

Box 5. The Implications of the Fiscal Rule Under Different Assumptions
The implications of the fiscal rule for the ultimate size of the GPFG and the fiscal resources it can provide in
the long term are very sensitive to assumptions and parameter choices. The real rate of return, the size of
fiscal transfer from the GPFG, and other assumptions and parameters (e.g., oil prices) all have an important
effect on the long run value of the GPFG and the fiscal transfer (e.g., in the latter part of the century).
However, the size of the fiscal transfer over the next decade is only modestly affected by the true real rate of
return or the oil price assumption under plausible parameter values.
The various challenges posed by the fiscal rule are affected differently by different parameters. Because the
only variable that would have much effect on the size of the fiscal transfer over the next two decades is the
amount of the annual fiscal transfer itself as a share of GPFG assets, this parameter is the key to addressing
concerns about the effect of the fiscal transfer on the competitiveness of non-oil related parts of the
mainland economy. However, the true real rate of return becomes more important at longer time horizons,
and the difference between the real rate and the fiscal transfer would be more important in addressing
concerns related to intergenerational equity or aligning the fiscal transfers more closely with aging-related
costs. This is illustrated in a baseline projection and four alternative combinations of ex post rates of return
and annual fiscal transfers. These and other scenarios (e.g., varying oil prices) are discussed in greater detail
in Chapter 3 of the Selected Issues Paper.

20.
In light of the above considerations, a more conservative approach to implementation
of the fiscal rule would be desirable. Various aspects of the current rule could be reassessed,
including the realism of the 4 percent real rate of return assumption. However, the only change that
would make much difference for the fiscal impulse in the near- and medium-term would be a
change in the rate of fiscal transfer as a share of the GPFG’s assets. The authorities have sufficient
flexibility to reduce the rate of transfer so long as current conditions persist. This would help contain
pressures on competitiveness and promote long-run stability within the real economy.

Authorities’ views
21.
The authorities agreed with much of the staff’s stance, but had difference of emphasis
and degree, particularly as regards the fiscal rule. They shared the concerns about the long-term
competitiveness problem and high wage costs, and they had put particular emphasis on the
growing divide between oil- and non-oil-related parts of the mainland economy for that reason. For
the near term, the Finance Minister had signaled the intention to spend less than the expected longterm return on the GPFG in 2014 and announced a reduction of taxes on mainland businesses and a
slight increase of oil-related taxes recently.
22.
The authorities emphasized the success of the fiscal rule over the medium- and longer
term in containing and smoothing spending from oil-related revenues since its introduction in
2001. They also noted that the rule is not rigid, and allows for variation in the share of GPFG assets
transferred to the budget in light of economic conditions, as has been the case in recent years. They
did not disagree that the difference between the 3.2 percent real rate of return experienced thus far
and the assumed 4 percent would have large consequences if it persisted over the very long run;
however, they took the view that the observed difference thus far fell well short of statistical
significance given the high volatility of assets returns and the short history of the GPFG. They had
concerns that reopening it risked ending up with a worse outcome and one that would go in the
opposite direction from the staff’s advice. They agreed strongly that oil-related revenue would not
be the solution to aging-related expenditures. They also made the point that most of the wealth of
the Norwegian economy was in the human capital of Norwegians rather than oil or the proceeds
from its sale (Box 6).

B. Monetary Policy
23.
Norges Bank’s monetary policy stance has been unchanged since March 2012. The
policy rate is currently 1.5 percent. Wage growth, a positive output gap, and the stabilization of the
exchange rate appreciation should increase inflation gradually to the 2.5 percent target by 2018. The
staff agreed with the authorities that the current policy stance is appropriate in light of below-target
CPI inflation. While overheating in property markets is a concern, monetary policy is constrained by
the lower-than-target inflation and the appreciating exchange rate.

Authorities’ views
24.
The authorities reemphasized that the current monetary policy stance is appropriate in
light of low CPI inflation. The authorities noted that the current policy rate is higher than what
would have been implied by a rule that focused only on inflation and output, and vulnerabilities
stemming from rising house prices need to be addressed through macro prudential and other
financial sector policies.

C. Financial Sector Issues
25.
The proposed legislation to increase capital requirements for banks in line with, but
ahead of, the Basel III requirements, including the proposed counter-cyclical buffer is
welcome. The authorities are preparing to implement a counter-cyclical buffer rule in 2014 that will
require banks to build up additional capital in line with the draft EU banking regulations (CRD IV).
More capital to support exposures will strengthen banks and might help to appropriately tighten
lending standards, including for housing. This should not be disruptive to credit as banks have
already begun raising capital ratios in anticipation of higher capital requirements.

18

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

26.
Notwithstanding its strength, there
remain risks in the financial system. Banks’ and
their mortgage company subsidiaries have increased
securities issuance, including covered bonds. Twothirds of this is foreign debt. While this is largely
hedged against exchange rate movement, the
reliance on wholesale funding exposes the system
to a risk of a sharp rise in interest rates. Moreover,
the rapid rise of covered bonds creates incentives to
shift lending toward households rather than
corporates and increases risks to unsecured
creditors and depositors. The use of covered bonds
should be monitored closely and limits on issuance
should be considered for individual banks or the
banking system if the issuance of covered bonds
leaves too few unencumbered high-quality assets on
banks’ balance sheets or otherwise increases risks.
Some scaling back of the generous tax incentives for
housing would also help limit overinvestment in
housing relative to other assets.

tightened guidelines for residential mortgage
lending in December 2011, by lowering the maximum LTV on mortgages to 85 percent and
recommending that banks ensure borrowers can withstand an interest rate increase of 5 percentage
points when assessing borrower’s debt service capacity. Mortgage loans exceeding the
recommended 85 percent ceiling fell in 2012, even though they still accounted for 17 percent of
new loans. Interest-only mortgage loans have been close to 20 percent of all new loans for the past
few years. In light of already elevated household debt, the staff urged the authorities to consider
tighter limits on interest-only mortgage loans to limit risks.
28.
The staff welcomed the authorities’ proposals to reassess relatively low risk weights on
residential mortgages. These create creating incentives to shift lending toward households rather
than corporates. The size of risk weights on residential mortgages needs to be assessed in the
context of strengthening banks’ capital to minimize incentives for banks to reduce corporate lending
to meet the new capital requirement.

regulatory standards, would help minimize regulatory
arbitrage. The staff welcomed the ongoing Nordic cooperation on macroprudential and financial
supervisory issues, including a high-level working group to assess various aspects of the Basel
III/CRD IV framework in the Nordic context.

Authorities’ views
30.
The authorities considered that an early implementation of Basel III requirements,
including the counter cyclical capital buffer, would mitigate a build-up of financial
vulnerabilities in the near- and medium-term. While taking the view that tightening of risk
weights preferably should be done in a Nordic context to minimize regulatory arbitrage and ensure
a level playing field for all Nordic banks, they took the view that taking actions to increase capital
against housing and credit risks on their own was important. The authorities forcefully agreed with a
need for cooperation within the Nordic region on macroprudential measures to ensure foreign
branches in Norway to operate in line with Norwegian prudential requirements.

D. Other Structural Policies
31.
Work has been done to identify areas that offer potentially large gains from structural
reforms. These areas include labor and pension policies, competition and trade policies, and the
efficiency of public sector services. These have been subject to recent and thorough analysis by the
OECD and WTO, among others. The staff discussed with the authorities reforms taken in the areas
identified by the OECD and WTO, and prospects for future reforms.
Labor market and pensions: Participation rates remains high; however, total work hours are
low and sickness leave and disability-related early retirement are at levels that seem inconsistent
with Norway’s otherwise excellent health indicators. The recent pension reforms introduced an
adjustment of pensions for changes in life expectancy, flexible retirement starting at age 62
based on actuarial principles, and new rules for indexation of pensions. The full impact of the

reform is yet to be known, but Statistics Norway estimates that total man-hours will increase by
roughly 7 percent in 2050.11 The staff urged the authorities to complete the pension reform by
fully aligning the rules for public sector pensions with the principles of the recent pension
reform. Further reform to sickness and disability benefits should be considered, including
strengthening the monitoring of eligibility for sickness benefits.


Competition and trade policies: Norway’s trade policies compare favorably with peer
countries. However, trade policies for agricultural products competing with Norwegian farms are
more restrictive than those of the EU and have recently become still more restrictive for some
products. A recent study by Eurostat ranked Norway’s food costs as the highest in Europe.
Reduction of agricultural trade barriers could help contain the rising cost of living.



Public sector efficiency: There is scope for greater efficiency in the provision of public services,
including making more effective use of cost-benefit, quality assurance, and other methods of
assessing spending efficiency in prioritizing public current and capital expenditure.

Authorities’ views
32.
The authorities agreed the need for furthering reforms of pension, sickness, and
disability benefits given the long-run contingent obligations. They reported that there are no
plans to change policies for agricultural products although they agreed with the economic
assessment of their effects. They generally agreed with the importance of improving public sector
efficiency, but also noted that many assessment and evaluation tools are already in place.

STAFF APPRAISAL
33.
Norway’s economy continues to perform well. Over the last two years, mainland GDP has
grown steadily and looks likely to continue to do so over the medium term. Inflation is below the
2.5 percent target and unemployment has been low and stable at around 3 –3½ percent, and the
value of the krone seems broadly appropriate for current macroeconomic conditions.
34.
The monetary policy stance remains appropriate in light of below-target core CPI
inflation. Monetary policy is constrained by possible upward pressure on exchange rates and the
lower-than-target inflation rate. A tightening of policy might help cool housing markets, but at the
cost of likely exchange rate appreciation and additional pressure on the non-oil-related sectors of
the mainland economy. In this context, risks from house prices should be addressed instead through
macroprudential policies.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

21

NORWAY

35.
The government has used the flexibility in the fiscal rule prudently. A continuation of
the prudent fiscal stance would not offset the pressures on competitiveness, but it would limit how
much fiscal policies added to them. A lower rate of spending in the 2014 budget and beyond would
be appropriate in light of the wage pressures and other competitiveness concerns. In this regard, the
recently proposed tax measures to limit preferential tax treatment for residential investment and
increase taxation of the oil sector should help slow the erosion of competitiveness.
36.
Competitiveness concerns and future fiscal liabilities from an aging population also
argue for a slower rate of spending than the strictest interpretations of the fiscal rule would
suggest. A more conservative approach would not only guard against the risk to competitiveness
for sharply rising transfers to the budget from the GPFG but would also provision against long-run
downside risks. Further reform to sickness and disability benefits would likely improve the efficiency
and competitiveness of the economy, but they would also help contain the large fiscal liabilities
from an aging population. A slower rate of fiscal transfers from the GPFG would complement such
reforms by better aligning long-run spending obligations with fiscal transfers.
37.
The staff supports the proposed legislation to increase capital requirements for banks
in line with the Basel III requirements. Financial sector balance sheets are improving and the
funding structure of banks is now more robust, but they would still be vulnerable in the event of
property price reversals or a disruption to external wholesale funding. More capital to support
exposures will further strengthen banks and might encourage banks to appropriately tighten
lending standards, including for housing. In this context, the staff also welcome the proposal to
reassess risk weights for residential mortgages.
38.
There is also a need for more cooperation within the Nordic region on
macroprudential measures for banks. The Norwegian authorities can tighten risk weights and
other conditions for Norwegian banks (including subsidiaries of foreign banks), but a substantial
part of the banking system in Norway consists of branches of foreign banks. Regional cooperation is
needed to ensure that foreign-headquartered bank branches lend in line with Norwegian economic
conditions.
39.
Reforms in disability benefits, lower trade barriers, and more efficient public services
could improve cost competitiveness and improve the efficiency of the economy. In particular,
the pension reform needs to be completed by fully aligning the rules for public sector pensions with
the principles of the recent pension reform. Further reform to sickness and disability benefits are
needed, including strengthening the monitoring of eligibility for sickness benefits.
40.
It is recommended that the next Article IV consultation with Norway be held on the
24 month cycle.

● Slower European growth in an extended
time period would affect Norway, through
weaker non-oil exports and lower oil prices.
Lower asset prices would have negative
impacts on the rate of return to GPFG.

● A fall in house prices would dampen private
consumption and reduce residential
investment.
● The high level of household debt may cause
households to cut consumption sharply, and
reduced retail sales could lead to an increase
in default rates that would severely hurt banks'
balance sheets.

Medium
● Re-emergence of euro zone stress and an
associated slowdown in growth would affect
Norway via shaken consumer confidence,
lower non-oil exports, and falling oil prices.

housing due to confidence effects or a
reversal of immigrant inflows.

Note: The Risk Assessment Matrix (RAM) shows events that could materially alter the baseline path (the scenario most
likely to materialize in the view of IMF staff). The relative likelihood of risks listed is the staff's subjective assessment of
the risks surrounding the baseline. The RAM reflects staff views on the source of risks and overall level of concern as of
the time of discussions with the authorities.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
September 5, 2013

International Monetary Fund
Washington, D.C. 20431 USA

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2013 Article IV Consultation with Norway
On August 30, 2013, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF)
concluded the Article IV consultation with Norway.1
The Norwegian economy continues to perform well with mainland (i.e. non-oil) GDP
growing steadily at 2.5–3 percent, driven by private consumption, investment, and low
interest rates. Despite strong domestic demand, inflation remains subdued, running below the
2.5 percent target, mostly due to declining import prices. Unemployment remains low at
around 3–3.5 percent. The current account surplus was 19 percent of mainland GDP in 2012,
boosted by strong oil prices and production. The general government balance was in surplus
in 2012 and the non-oil structural fiscal deficit was 4.8 percent of mainland GDP or about 3.2
percent of the sovereign wealth fund (Government Pension Fund Global or GPFG) capital.
This is below the deficit permitted under the authorities’ fiscal policy rule, but it still implies
a slightly positive fiscal impulse due to the strong growth in GPFG assets.
However, the overall strength of the mainland economy masks divergent trends. A strong and
growing set of industries supplying goods and services to the offshore sector coexist with a
non-oil related subset of the mainland economy under increasing cost and competitiveness
pressures. This divergence is also evident in cost pressures especially because of rapidly
rising unit labor costs (ULC). Norway’s ULC-based real effective exchange rate appreciated
substantially over the past decade, suggesting an erosion of long-term cost competitiveness.
House prices are high and increasing, and household debt is also high. The authorities
tightened lending guidelines for mortgage loans in December 2011, and they are considering
options for further tightening macroprudential limits including by increasing risk weights on

1

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with members,
usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial information, and discusses
with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a
report, which forms the basis for discussion by the Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the
Managing Director, as Chairman of the Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary
is transmitted to the country's authorities. An explanation of any qualifiers used in summings up can be found
here: http://www.imf.org/external/np/sec/misc/qualifiers.htm.

2
mortgage loans. They are also consulting with other Nordic countries on how to regulate the
operations of bank branches operating in Norway but headquartered elsewhere in the region.
Growth in the mainland economy is projected to continue at a moderate pace, largely
supported by high activity in the petroleum sector and strong domestic demand. However,
this central scenario is subject to key risks. A substantial and prolonged reduction in oil
prices could undercut growth in the event that downside risks to the global growth outlook
materialize. Also, a correction in the buoyant housing market could reduce household
consumption with adverse consequences for retail trade, construction, commercial real estate,
and lenders to those sectors.
Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors appreciated the additional context provided by the Nordic Regional
Report. They welcomed Norway’s sound macroeconomic management, which has
underpinned steady growth and low unemployment in a difficult global environment.
Directors agreed that the main challenge is to maintain macroeconomic and financial stability
while containing vulnerabilities stemming from elevated house prices and high household
indebtedness. In the longer run, competitiveness pressures on the mainland economy and the
fiscal impact of population aging need to be addressed.
Directors concurred that the current monetary policy stance is appropriate. Inflation remains
below target and is likely to increase only gradually as the economy approaches its potential
and upward pressures on the exchange rate recede. Directors agreed that overheating in the
property market should be addressed by tightening macroprudential policies and reducing the
tax advantage of residential investment.
Directors welcomed the authorities’ prudent use of flexibility in the fiscal rule. Most
Directors considered that wage pressures and eroding competitiveness in the non-oil sector
argue for a slower rate of spending—in the 2014 budget and beyond—than the strictest
interpretations of the fiscal rule would suggest. In addition, a conservative approach would
help address future spending pressures connected with population aging.
Directors stressed the importance of further strengthening supervision and the regulatory
framework in the financial sector. They supported the proposed legislation to increase capital
requirements for banks in line with Basel III requirements. They also noted that more capital
would appropriately support exposures and hedge against risks such as property price
reversals or a disruption to external wholesale funding. In this context, Directors welcomed
the proposal to reassess risk weights for residential mortgages and the consideration of
measures to address risks related to covered bonds. In addition, they encouraged the
authorities to enforce tighter limits on loan-to-value ratios and interest-only mortgages.
Directors concurred that greater cross-border coordination on macroprudential measures—as

3
recommended by the Nordic Regional Report—is necessary to limit regulatory arbitrage and
ensure that foreign-headquartered bank branches lend in line with economic conditions in
Norway.
Directors agreed that structural reforms are needed to enhance the competitiveness of the
mainland economy. Priority areas include labor market, pensions, trade in agriculture
products, and public sector services. Sickness and disability benefits could be further
reformed to improve efficiency and help contain future pressures on government spending.

Statement by Audun Groenn, Executive Director for Norway
August 30, 2013
On behalf of my Norwegian authorities, I would like to thank staff for a very well-written
report on the Norwegian economy. Norwegian authorities broadly agree with staff’s findings
and analysis in the report, and welcome the recommendations.
Economic developments and main challenges
The description of current economic developments and the outlook for the Norwegian
economy are broadly in line with those of my authorities. Prospects for a balanced
development in the Norwegian economy in the medium run are indeed good. But, as staff
also notes, these are subject to some key risks. The risk assessment matrix presented on page
23 gives a good summary.
One main challenge for the Norwegian economy is an increased dependence of the Mainland
economy on providing supplies and services to the oil sector. While these sectors are
prospering, other industries exposed to international competition are under increasing cost
and competitiveness pressure. High wage cost levels and a strong krone exchange rate
constitute a threat to a balanced development in the years ahead. These challenges will
become even more pronounced some years from now, when oil investments are expected to
decline, or if prices should fall and remain low for an extended period.
Another challenge is high house prices and households’ high debt levels, thoroughly
addressed by staff in selected issues. House prices have increased steadily over the last two
decades, only interrupted by a slight decline starting in mid-2007 and ending in late 2008. In
recent months, however, house price increases have slowed down. Several factors have
contributed to the rise in real house prices; income has grown rapidly and the real interest
rate has been low for several years. Furthermore, since 2007 the supply of housing in
Norway has been lagging behind the number of households. Nevertheless, the risk that house
prices are substantially overvalued is significant. Norwegian authorities do share staff’s view
that household’s high debt burden could amplify a possible economic downturn, and they
stress the need to strengthen financial market regulation; see below.
Monetary policy
My Norwegian authorities generally concur with staff’s assessment of monetary policy.
Despite robust growth in the Norwegian economy, inflation has been low for a long time. In
the June 2013 Monetary Policy Report, Norges Bank’s baseline outlook was that the
Mainland economy will be growing at a somewhat slower pace than in previous years, but
still remain rather robust and close to its potential. Inflation is low and wage growth has
come down. It is primarily external factors that are holding down price and cost inflation in
the Norwegian economy. As long as the crisis in Europe persists and labor immigration
remains high, wage growth and inflation in Norway are expected to be dampened. In such a
situation, a pronounced decrease in the key policy rate is likely necessary to bring up
inflation more rapidly. Such an interest rate response may lead to a further acceleration in
house prices and debt, augmenting the risk that financial imbalances trigger or amplify an
economic downturn. This suggests a less pronounced response in interest rate setting.

2
Against this background, the Executive Board of the Bank was of the view that it is
appropriate to allow more time to bring inflation up to target. In the baseline outlook, there
are prospects of a gradual rise in inflation and a capacity utilization that is close to a normal
level through the period to 2016.
Fiscal policy
Norway’s fiscal institutions, including the Government Pension Fund Global (GPFG)
mechanism and the fiscal rule, support a stable development of the Mainland economy by
containing and smoothing spending of oil-related revenues. As emphasized in the staff’s
report, avoidance of off-budget spending or special purpose funds is a crucial element of the
fiscal framework.
The imbedded flexibility of the fiscal rule allowed for using fiscal policy measures to
dampen the cyclical downturn following the financial crises in 2008 and 2009. The validity
of the fiscal rule was confirmed by the subsequent fiscal restraint when growth and
employment picked up again, reducing structural non-oil deficits to well below 4 percent of
the GPFG in 2011, 2012 and 2013.
The large petroleum revenues necessitate a plan for how to handle them. Petroleum revenues
are set aside in the GPFG, while the fiscal rule links the development in the non-oil budget
deficit to the expected real return on GPFG assets. This feature makes it easier to
communicate how petroleum revenues are dealt with and how they benefit both current and
future generations. It has shown to be politically robust.
As noted in the report, the fiscal rule implies a gradual widening of non-oil fiscal deficits into
the next decade, however following a gradual and smooth path. The limiting of spending to
the expected real return accumulated in the GPFG, nevertheless gives a more prudent path
than those followed by other petroleum producers. Currently, spending is even lower than
this, since structural non-oil deficits are closer to 3 than to 4 percent of the GPFG.
As noted in the report, fiscal policy is not the main source of pressure in the non-oil
Mainland economy. Increased demand from the petroleum sector is the major growth driver.
With GPFG increasing as a share of GDP, the flexibility of the fiscal rule allows for
containing transfers from the GPFG relative to expected real rate of return as long as the
current high capacity utilization persists.
The substantial fiscal challenges associated with an ageing population cannot be dealt with
solely by increased savings in the GPFG. The ageing of the population mainly reflects that
we live longer and healthier lives. Measures aiming at providing incentives for work and
structural changes in expenditure arrangements are thus crucial for sustainable government
finances. The reform of old age pensions provides an important example of recent measures
in this direction, and we take note of reform proposals in other expenditure areas in the staff
report.
Future developments of GPFG value and transfers from the GPFG to the budget are uncertain.
This is illustrated in the report by means of applying alternative assumptions for oil price and
real rate of return. A comparison of the baseline projections in the report and national
projections presented in a recent white paper on long-term perspectives for the Norwegian
economy also illustrates how assumptions on GDP developments may influence projections.
In particular, assumptions related to domestic price developments seem to imply a higher

3
nominal GDP growth – and a less pronounced peak towards 2030 – in the national
projections compared to the baseline presented by the staff.
The report compares the real rate of return assumption of 4 percent in the fiscal rule with the
average real rate of return of 3.2 percent for GPFG for the period 1997 – 2012. Offering a
longer time perspective, the report also refers to an average real rate of return of 3.7 percent
earned by a global benchmark portfolio mix of 60 percent equities and 40 percent bonds for
the last 113 years. These calculations are however sensitive to country weights applied and
currency applied for measurement. For instance, a calculation carried out by the Ministry of
Finance, based on the same dataset, gives a real rate of return of approximately 4 percent for
a global portfolio mix of 60 percent equities and 40 percent bonds over the same period. This
calculation uses the global equity return series in USD and the country-specific bond return
series in local currency, the latter being GDP-weighted.
Financial sector issues
Norwegian financial institutions have continued to strengthen their solvency over the last
years, primarily by retaining profits and issuing equity. The institutions have also improved
their funding structure.
As already mentioned, the Norwegian authorities generally concur with staff’s assessment of
the risks and vulnerabilities associated with households’ indebtedness and a possible house
price reversal, as well as on financial institutions’ reliance on wholesale funding. Continued
low interest rates may influence expectations and contribute to further increases in housing
prices and household debt. This poses a significant risk to financial stability in Norway. New
rules on capital requirements in line with the Basel III standards were implemented on
July 1of this year, well ahead of international transposition dates. Today, there is a common
equity capital requirement of 9 percent, including buffer requirements. This combined
requirement will increase to 10 percent next year. For systemically important institutions the
common equity capital requirement will rise to 11 percent in 2015, and finally to 12 percent
in 2016. The Norwegian authorities are now drafting detailed rules and assessment
methodologies for the identification of systemically important institutions, in line with
recommendations of the Basel Committee.
The Norwegian authorities will shortly adopt a regulation on the use of the counter-cyclical
capital buffer requirement in Norway. The Ministry of Finance will set the buffer
requirement, based on policy advice, and a buffer guide and other relevant analysis produced
by Norges Bank. The central bank will, in the preparation of this analysis, exchange
information and assessments with the financial supervisory authority. As noted in staff’s
report, Norwegian IRB banks’ risk weights on residential mortgages are relatively low,
which may give further incentives for banks to shift credit supply towards residential
mortgages if the current Basel I floor rules are abolished. The Ministry of Finance has
recently conducted a public consultation on alternative draft rules for strengthening IRB risk
weights on residential mortgages. These draft rules may – like a possible continuation of the
Basel I floor rules for the whole capital requirement – subdue such a potential shift in lending.
The Ministry is also considering measures to address risks from the growing importance of
the covered bonds market as a funding source for Norwegian financial institutions.
My authorities are pleased to note that staff recognizes one of the most important financial
sector policy issues for Norway today, namely the need for more cooperation within the

4
Nordic region on prudential requirements for credit institutions. As I have explained, the
Norwegian authorities are taking important steps to improve the soundness of Norwegian
institutions. However, a substantial part of the banking system in Norway consists of
branches of institutions that are based in other Nordic countries and with weaker capital
requirements. Norway is therefore working together with the Nordic countries on the
possibility of establishing a greater degree of host country regulation, especially for mortgage
loan risk weights. The Norwegian authorities believe that different national circumstances
may require different prudential policy responses, and that a greater degree of host country
regulation will contribute to securing financial stability and leveling the playing field in
national credit markets.
