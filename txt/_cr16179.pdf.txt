IMF Executive Board Concludes 2016 Article IV Consultation with Iceland
On June 20, 2016 the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded
the 2016 Article IV consultation with Iceland.1
The outlook is positive. Growth is accelerating this year and is expected to exceed
4.5 percent, led by robust domestic demand and booming tourism. Growth will likely slow
thereafter as policies to dampen excess demand and inflationary pressures take hold.
Inflation, at 1.7 percent in May, is being contained by falling import prices and króna
appreciation. Given recent large wage awards, however, it is projected to breach the inflation
target of 2.5 percent later this year, peaking next year before coming down gradually. Wage
growth is expected to erode competitiveness over time, with the current account surplus
shrinking steadily. These processes, if not sufficiently restrained by macroeconomic policies,
could overheat the economy. This is the main risk for Iceland.
Executive Board Assessment2
Executive Directors commended the Icelandic authorities’ progress in addressing crisis
legacies, where recent milestones include the accords with the bank estates and the foreign
exchange auction for offshore króna holders. This, coupled with the favorable
macroeconomic conditions and outlook, should support the country’s reintegration into
global financial markets. Directors noted that, beyond uncertainties associated with the
imminent U.K. referendum on EU membership, the main challenge for Iceland is to avoid a
possible overheating of its economy and, in this regard, they also cautioned against any pre
election fiscal easing. Directors called on the authorities to exercise caution as they scale
back capital controls on residents, accompanying this with monetary and some fiscal

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with members,
usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial information, and discusses
with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a
report, which forms the basis for discussion by the Executive Board.

At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the Board, summarizes the views
of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the country's authorities. An explanation of any
qualifiers used in summings up can be found here: http://www.imf.org/external/np/sec/misc/qualifiers.htm.

tightening to cool demand, a framework to build reserves, and institutional reforms to anchor
wage bargaining on competitiveness and to further strengthen financial sector oversight.
Directors welcomed the new Organic Budget Law, which creates a rules based, multi year
fiscal planning framework, brings in the municipalities, and helps anchor fiscal discipline.
They emphasized that compliance with the new fiscal rules will be essential to maintain
credibility. Directors supported the authorities’ commitment to save the one off fiscal
receipts from the bank estates and the plans for a moderately tighter fiscal stance in 2017.
They encouraged the authorities to revisit public spending priorities over the medium term,
with a view to decompressing health, education, and capital spending, and to consider further
reforms of value added taxes to mobilize additional revenues.
Directors supported the central bank’s readiness to raise interest rates as needed. They
encouraged the monetary authorities to further articulate their exchange market intervention
policy, re emphasizing the primacy of the inflation target and distinguishing between reserve
accumulation and market stability objectives. Directors recommended a conservative
approach to reserve adequacy, especially while capital account liberalization is ongoing.
They welcomed steps to strengthen the macroprudential toolkit, and took note of recent
legislation laying the basis for a reserve requirement on specified debt capital inflows.
Directors emphasized that capital flow management measures should be transparent,
targeted, temporary, and preferably non discriminatory, and should not substitute for
warranted macroeconomic adjustment.
Directors advised that capital flow liberalization for residents should be executed cautiously.
They agreed that permitting more outward investment by pension funds is a logical first step,
albeit one that should be matched by actions to strengthen the Pension Fund Act. At the same
time, a comprehensive strategy should be drawn up to guide liberalization for households,
firms, and banks, embedding concrete commitments to further improve banking regulation
and supervision.
Directors underscored that with increased presence of the government in the banking system,
prudent management of the state banks is crucial while suitable disposal arrangements are
pursued. They recommended increasing the powers and independence of the financial
regulator. Given the involvement of both the financial regulator and the central bank in
banking oversight, Directors encouraged consideration of streamlining options, such as
unifying all prudential oversight of banks at the central bank; other options also warrant
study.

STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2016 ARTICLE IV CONSULTATION
June 3, 2016

KEY ISSUES
Iceland wants to reintegrate into world financial markets. There is little precedent for
adopting and abolishing full scope capital controls in the space of a decade, yet Iceland
seeks to do precisely this. After the recent accords with the failed bank estates, economic
conditions augur well for the liberalizing endeavor. Even so, what awaits is ultimately a
leap into the unknown. Iceland is determined to press forward.
Staff pointed to risks and challenges. Free capital mobility will bring benefits yet risks
also abound. In the very near term, there are the “Brexit” risks. Then there is the concern
that surging wages could overheat demand. Compounding this will be the challenges of
seeking to tailor local monetary policy to local conditions and of maintaining financial
stability in the face of potentially large and volatile cross border capital flows.
The authorities know that opening up calls for prudence, firmness, and innovation:
prudence in macroeconomic policy, in the determined pursuit of low debt and price
stability; firmness in financial sector oversight, intrusive and uncompromising; and
innovation in readying new macroprudential tools, including some to slow capital flows
at the gates as needed. These were the main topics of the 2016 consultation.
Staff made the case that sailing this voyage safely calls for stronger institutions.
The Organic Budget Law is an important step forward, introducing a rules based
medium-term fiscal framework that brings in the municipalities. Structural changes are
also needed in labor relations and in finance, to anchor wage bargaining on
competitiveness and to give banking supervision real teeth and independence.
When the saga is written, hopefully, it will tell of a smooth transition. Iceland’s new
economic model should meld sustainable tourism and fisheries with investment in
advanced technologies to harness and export its unique endowment of renewable
energy. Banking and finance must be servant, not master, under the ever watchful eye of
regulators that will not countenance a repeat of the boom-bust cycles of the past.

POLICY PRIORITIES AND RECENT INDICATORS
1.
Iceland wants to reintegrate into world financial markets. There is a mounting sense that
capital controls hurt growth prospects, repressing local financial markets, scaring foreign investors,
and impeding savings diversification, and that it is time for them to go. Recent settlements with the
bank estates are a huge step forward, improving already favorable macroeconomic conditions.
Popular sentiment, to be voiced at the polls in the coming months, wants action.
2.
Growth is strong. At 4 percent in 2015 and gaining pace, real GDP expansion is among the
fastest in Europe, opening up a positive output gap. The tourism boom goes on, with visitors
outnumbering residents 7:1, spurring airline expansion, hotel projects, and hospitality jobs. Surging
private consumption reflects growing employment, wages, and household net worth. Spirited
investment activity includes new silicon plants, ship and aircraft purchases, and construction.

Inflation remains controlled, helped by
import prices and appreciation. The inflation
rate is below the Central Bank of Iceland (CBI)
target of 2½ percent. Falling import prices
coupled with króna appreciation are cushioning
the effects of negotiated wage awards of about
25 percent for 2015–18 which, including estimates
for wage drift and pension contributions, could
increase wage costs by 30–35 percent over the
period. The CBI hiked its policy rate in June,
August, and November by 125 basis points in
total, to 5¾ percent, and has signaled readiness
for further tightening. The króna appreciated by
8.4 percent in nominal and 10.1 percent in real
effective terms in the 12 months to April 2016.

The general government recorded a deficit of ½ percent of GDP in 2015. Public sector
wage growth and municipal borrowing were important drivers. The structural primary surplus
contracted by some 0.7 percent of potential GDP, implying a substantial demand impulse. The
Organic Budget Law, developed with significant input from Fund staff, was passed in December.

Strong bank results benefited from revaluations and cheap deposits given capital
controls. The three main banks’ raw capital ratios were 19–24 percent at end 2015, and the
aggregate nonperforming loan ratio was near 8 percent. Credit is picking up from subdued levels.
Funding is dominated by deposits with nowhere else to go, resulting in a rich margin. Loan values
are still climbing from their deeply discounted original transfer levels, yielding valuation gains
equivalent to half of net interest income in 2015. The return on assets was an enviable 3.4 percent.

SETTLEMENT OF THE FAILED BANK ESTATES
7.
The recent settlements of the bank estates are a big achievement. The “composition”
agreements signed in late 2015 haircut further bank claims in default since 2008–09 (many of which
changed hands subsequently) as a quid pro quo for lifting capital controls on the estates. Back then,
Iceland carved new banks from the rumps of the old, taking assets at deep discounts and, for two
estates, providing equity in the successor banks as compensation. Now, one of those two banks is

given to the state, the other pledged, and more,
with the estates forswearing lawsuits. A major
crisis legacy is thus cleared, on terms beneficial to
Iceland, even if damage to future flows cannot be
excluded. Staff estimates the state has now gained
on its direct crisis support to the banks (Box 1).
8.
The flow of funds is massive. The estates
assign most of their króna assets to the state
(17 percent of GDP), distribute recoveries to the
CBI as a claimant (about 4 percent), term out their
domestic foreign currency deposits for seven years
(4 percent), and dip into their external assets to
refinance certain CBI and government claims on
the banks (2½ percent of GDP). They agree to
these actions so they may immediately distribute
liquid foreign assets worth some 35 percent of
Icelandic GDP to their predominantly foreign
claimants, with more to follow over time.

foreign currency liquidity coverage ratios (LCRs) and net stable funding ratios (NSFRs). Withdrawals
of the estates’ króna deposits lower total LCRs.
Box 1. Direct Costs of Iceland’s Banking Crisis
Direct state support to the financial sector during
the crisis amounted to some 34 percent of GDP.
Both the CBI and the banks had to be recapitalized,
with the former suffering large losses after its
emergency liquidity assistance claims on the banks
defaulted and collateral had to be written down. To
cover these losses, in 2009 the government gave the
CBI a bond worth 18 percent of GDP. In 2009–12 it
provided the banks a separate bond worth 15 percent
of GDP. Costs were limited by conservative valuations
on assets transferred and steadfast refusal to socialize
losses on the failed banks’ foreign operations.
Recoveries are estimated at 43 percent of GDP.
There are four parts: (i) bank equity and subordinated
debt taken in 2009 as consideration for
recapitalizations, the estimated value of which was
15 percent of GDP at end 2015; (ii) dividends and
coupons on those claims, cumulating to around
3 percent of GDP in 2010–15; (iii) the stability
contributions from the failed bank estates in the
context of the compositions, valued on an accruals
basis at 17 percent of GDP; and (iv) profits and
interest payments to the CBI by the asset
management subsidiary it established in 2009 to hold
its seized collateral, cumulating to an expected
8 percent of GDP over 2010–16.

Iceland has thus fared remarkably well in terms of direct costs, with the state estimated to have made
a net gain in excess of 9 percent of GDP. This compares favorably to many other crisis countries, a salutary
feat given the enormity of Iceland’s pre crisis banking system relative to its economy. Taxes lost or gained
are not part of this analysis. Nor is any attempt made to quantify the vast economic costs of the crisis.

capital controls on nonresidents with significant easing for residents is seen as a political imperative.
Figure 7. Balance Sheet Effects of Composition

West's Encyclopedia of American Law (edition 2, 2008) defines composition as “A contract made by an insolvent or
financially pressed debtor with two or more creditors in which the creditors agree to accept one specific partial payment of
the total amount of their claims, which is to be divided pro rata among them in full satisfaction of their claims.” In Iceland’s
case, strictly, the recent compositions are voted and binding agreements among claimants, estate by estate.

OUTLOOK AND RISKS
13.
The baseline has growth and inflation gaining pace before easing back. Monetary
tightening guides real GDP back to a potential growth rate of around 2½ percent. Private
consumption and investments in energy intensive sectors, housing, and hotels remain the main
drivers. With deleveraging having run its course and bank capital and liquidity supportive, credit
recovers, its rate of growth converging to that of GDP over the medium term. Inflation breaches the
target as wage increases feed through but does not break anchor. The CBI reacts with rate hikes,
returning inflation to target after three years without forcing a hard landing.

Falling competitiveness erodes the current account surplus. Commodity prices stabilize
while some potential tourists are deterred by high costs. Staff views Iceland’s external position as
broadly consistent with fundamentals and desirable policy settings, but this changes going forward
and the current account surplus is projected to shrink steadily (Box 2). Before factoring in flows
relating to capital account opening, reserves climb to a healthy $10 billion by 2021.
Box 2. Exchange Rate Assessment
The Fund’s macro balance assessment method
indicates modest exchange rate undervaluation. The
regression suggests the current account surplus in 2015
exceeded the level consistent with fundamentals and
desirable policies by about 2 percent of GDP. This, in
turn, suggests a real effective exchange rate (REER)
undervaluation of 5 percent, using a current account to
REER elasticity of about 0.33. The model fit is poor.
The REER approach, in contrast, points to modest
overvaluation, with a better fit. The regression
suggests an overvaluation of 4 percent, with a tighter fit
than in the macro balance approach.

On balance, staff views Iceland’s external position as broadly consistent with fundamentals and
desirable policy settings. The various exercises do not fully capture the effects of capital controls, however,
nor of structural breaks such as the tourism boom that followed the Eyjafjallajökull volcanic eruptions of
2010, nor of rising labor costs yet to be passed on to consumer prices. The sizeable real depreciation
following the 2008 crisis appears to have shifted the equilibrium REER to a new (lower) normal as
fundamentals also shifted to post crisis norms. These norms may shift again.

The biggest risk for Iceland is overheating. The large wage awards on top of already hot
economic readings speak to Iceland’s history of boom-bust. After years of expenditure restraint and
with parliamentary elections approaching, spending pressures could build. A fiscal easing while
wages surged would stoke domestic demand. If that were to coincide with rising import prices
feeding inflation, interest rates herding in hot money, and credit inflating asset prices, Iceland would
be left vulnerable to a sudden stop that itself could be triggered by outside factors.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

11

ICELAND

16.
Other risks range from policy errors to
trade shocks to natural events. Missteps could
occur in capital account opening, resulting in
potentially large outflows by residents. Iceland
could be hurt by trade, where the euro area for
instance buys 40 percent of its exports. And there
can always be shocks from disruptive volcanic
activity or upsides such as the arrival, from 2006,
of growing numbers of mackerel in national
waters potentially linked to climate change.

A U.K. vote to leave the EU would likely
dent Iceland’s exports. The United Kingdom
accounts for a tenth of Iceland’s service exports,
two thirds of which is tourism, and London is a
global financial center. If sterling depreciates
significantly and U.K. growth slows in a ”leave”
scenario, tourist arrivals and other demand for
Iceland’s exports from the United Kingdom could
weaken, while spillover effects could dent demand
from other countries. A “Brexit” vote could also
result in increased volatility in asset prices.

The authorities share staff’s views on the outlook and risks. They concurred current
conditions are positive. The CBI projects growth of 4½ percent this year, with a widening positive
output gap and inflation exceeding target at year end. Falling import prices and króna appreciation
are expected to continue to contain inflation until wage increases feed through more strongly in
2017. The authorities agree higher unit labor costs relative to trading partners will hurt the trade
balance. Like staff, the CBI shows the current account surplus shrinking steadily over the medium
term. There was strong agreement that overheating is the main risk.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

POLICY DISCUSSIONS
19.
Staff advised a cautious approach to capital account liberalization with supporting
institutional reforms. The wage framework should be revamped to prevent a replay of the recent
wage rounds. Lifting capital controls on residents will be delicate, calling for credibility, reserves, and
resilience. Staff suggested the right mix includes monetary and some fiscal tightening to cool
demand, a framework to build reserves, and a careful sequencing by sector, supported by steps to
build a solid microprudential foundation and an overlay of macroprudential tools.

A. Wage Bargaining
20.
Staff supported efforts to reform wage
setting. The share of compensation of employees
in GDP by factor cost has already reached its longrun average. Pointing out that the ratcheting wage
awards since early 2015 pose a challenge, it
supported efforts to anchor wage bargaining on
competitiveness and welcomed the new
Macroeconomic Council as a forum to bring
together social partners and policy makers.

The authorities view revamping the
wage bargaining framework as critical. They flag a risk that if price stability is maintained despite
the wage hikes—as they resolutely intend—the unions may downplay the external effects and again
push hard in the 2018 wage round. Seeking to head off such an outcome, the authorities have
signed an agreement with the unions and employers aiming to reach a labor market accord by end
2017. This will center on a new approach to wage settlement where the scope for changes in wages
will be determined by the competitive position of the export oriented manufacturing industries. The
authorities are cautiously optimistic that the Macroeconomic Council will help achieve consensus.

B. Fiscal Policy
22.
The Organic Budget Law is an important step forward. General government net debt,
conservatively defined as gross debt less deposits, may not exceed 30 percent of GDP; if it does, the
annual improvement in the net debt ratio may not be less than 1/20 of the excess. The rolling 5 year
sum of overall balances should never be less than zero, and the overall deficit may not exceed
2½ percent of GDP in any year. An escape clause allows the Minister of Finance to go to parliament
in the event of an extreme shock to seek authorization to deviate from the rules.
23.
The new fiscal rules are transparent and introduce a medium-term planning process.
Coupled with reforms underway that will lower taxes, they imply real spending growth well below
that of potential GDP. Consistent with saving the windfall from the estates and liquefying it over
time, a late amendment to the bill lowered the net debt ceiling from a previously envisaged

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

13

ICELAND

45 percent of GDP. The objective is sound, yet an
adjustor might have provided greater flexibility.
24.
Staff advised that the rules be
respected. Compliance will build credibility. The
authorities’ intention to use cash receipts from the
estates to pay down the CBI recapitalization bond,
with a remaining principal amount equivalent to
4 percent of GDP, is consistent with saving the
windfall. Noting that there is no calendar deadline
for meeting the net debt rule, staff cautioned
against any undue sense of haste in liquefying
state assets, especially the banks.

Figure 13. Fiscal Policy
Real General Government Expenditures

(Index, 2015=100)
140

26.
Staff called for firm budget execution in
2016 and a moderately tighter budget for
2017. Restraint is warranted from a cyclical
standpoint given the growing positive output gap.
The 2016 budget envisages a reduction in the
structural primary surplus relative to 2015 given
wage growth. A moderately tighter stance is
needed for 2017, where at a minimum the impulse
should not again be positive. While personal
income taxes fall, dividends from the state banks
and energy company climb and interest savings
should cumulate to about 1 percent of GDP in
2016–17. Room to cut spending is limited, but
further reforms of value added taxes could be
considered, including to increase the revenue take.
Iceland’s value added tax regime is among the
least efficient in the Nordic countries. The fiscal
plan for 2017–21, yet to be approved by
parliament, is broadly consistent with staff advice.

The 2016 budget includes an important
reform of the personal income tax system. The
main objectives of the reform are to increase labor
force participation and recalibrate the relative
importance of direct and indirect taxes. Personal
income tax rates will be reduced and the current
three rate bands harmonized into two, for an
annual revenue loss of about ½ percent of GDP.

Staff stressed the need for growth
enhancing expenditure reforms (Selected Issues).
These should seek to decompress education,
health, and capital spending by rationalizing
disability outlays, which have risen steadily, and
spending on social protection, which jumped
during the crisis and stays elevated despite job
creation. Education, health, and capital spending
remain below their real pre boom levels.
Discontent with medical service provision suggests
healthcare will be an election issue.

28.
The authorities broadly agreed with staff views. They regard the Organic Budget Law as a
game changer, bringing the municipalities into the planning framework and insulating fiscal policy
from the political cycle. They assured there is a political consensus to use the windfall from the
estates for debt reduction. There is no rush to sell the state banks, and dividend policy will be set at
arm’s length. They agreed fiscal policy should support monetary policy and suggested this is
reflected in the medium-term plan, which has a surplus of about 1 percent of GDP in 2017.
29.
The authorities acknowledged the need to reprioritize expenditures. The medium-term
fiscal plan has health and education expenditures rising, but not capital spending, where a new
hospital costing some 5 percent of GDP is to be offset by ambitious savings elsewhere. They were
also broadly in favor of further reforms of value added taxes, especially to limit exemptions, but
stressed there was little political appetite for further increases in the lower value added tax rate.

C. Monetary and Exchange Rate Policy
30.
Staff supported readiness for further rate hikes. Inflation expectations are elevated,
inflation is likely to breach target this year, the positive output gap is growing, and wages are
ratcheting upward. Falling import prices could prove transitory. With scope for countercyclical fiscal
policy limited by tax reforms and spending rigidities, and with CBI credibility at stake, more
monetary tightening will probably be needed. This should be done in measured, data driven steps.
The goal should be to keep inflation near target while finding a smooth glide path for the economy.
31.
Staff suggested the CBI develop an exchange market intervention policy consistent
with the inflation targeting (IT) framework. This should re-emphasize there is no exchange rate
objective, and distinguish between the separate goals of accumulating reserves and countering
disorderly market conditions. With further capital account opening high on the agenda, staff advised
a conservative approach to reserve adequacy, targeting perhaps around 1.5 times RAM, as before.
32.
Circumstances could arise where new capital flow management measures form part of
an efficient policy response. Capital flows into the long end of the (thin) Treasury bond market
have weakened policy transmission to long-term rates, distorting bond based measures of inflation
expectations and prompting concerns about a new carry trade. Staff pointed the authorities to the

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

15

ICELAND

Fund’s Institutional View, which takes the position
that capital flow management measures should be
transparent, targeted, temporary, and
nondiscriminatory and should not substitute for
warranted macroeconomic adjustment.
33.
The authorities stressed the primacy of
the price stability objective. The CBI Governor
describes a strengthened regime where IT coexists
with some foreign exchange intervention and
macroprudential policies. This framework, which
he calls “IT+”, will at some point formally succeed
the 2001 concordat on IT. The Governor sees
foreign exchange intervention as an instrument to
dampen excess volatility but not to target any
exchange rate level. The authorities regard recent
interventions as opportunistic and characterize
them as risk mitigating steps ahead of further
capital account liberalization. They acknowledged
a potential role for clearer communication on the
separate objectives of smoothing excess volatility
and building reserves, where developing a longterm policy on reserve accumulation remains a
work in progress. At the technical level, the CBI
subscribes to the IMF’s RAM methodology.

The authorities are working to develop

that interfere significantly with the domestic

requirements and direct levies on inflows were
mentioned as two options under the microscope

35.
Staff advised that steps to unlock restricted offshore krónur are best kept simple.
These blocked holdings, a legacy of the glacier bond era, are worth some 13 percent of GDP or
about 40 percent of reserves. Today, they mostly comprise bank deposits, Treasury securities, and
equity interests. The authorities plan one final offer to clear the overhang, with holdouts to be left in
special blocked accounts (Box 3). Estimating the balance of payments “space” available for both
offshore króna holders and residents by comparing projected reserves to levels consistent with
1.5 times RAM, staff pointed out tradeoffs but did not advise on parameters of the offer.
Box 3. One Final Offer to Offshore Króna Holders
The CBI has announced a final euro auction for
offshore króna holders, to be held on June 16, 2016.
All accepted bids will be offered to investors at the
same price. The auction exchange rate will be on a
sliding scale by size of total bid, with a best rate of
ISK 190:€1, implying a euro premium of roughly
27 percent over the current onshore market rate.
Participation is voluntary. Settlement will be on June 29.

until November 1 be eligible, however, for exit at ISK 220:€1 (about the weighted average rate of the
auctions held in 2011–15, a premium to the current onshore market rate of about 37 percent).
Ownership of the offshore króna assets, as now defined, has become more concentrated over time.
The four largest holders, all of which are major international asset managers, together own almost half of the
total. The auction terms are explicit that this “will be the last auction in which owners of offshore krónur will
be invited to purchase foreign currency before the authorities begin lifting controls on residents.”

36.
Staff urged a comprehensive plan be developed to guide capital account liberalization
for residents. Capital controls have been enforced exceptionally effectively. Their prolonged use,
however, is increasingly amplifying distortions, including for instance commercial real estate lending
by domestic pension funds via special purpose vehicles. Permitting significantly more outward
INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

17

ICELAND

investment by pension funds for portfolio
rebalancing purposes seems a logical first step,
including because such a quantity based approach
can be calibrated and controlled. Such exemptions
should be matched, however, by steps to
strengthen governance and risk management
provisions in the Pension Fund Act. A well
calibrated and comprehensive strategy should be
drawn up to sequence the subsequent easing of
restrictions on households and firms. One option
for households could be to allow outward
portfolio investments via mutual funds, where
overall amounts could be adjusted in light of
balance of payments conditions, mirroring the
approach applied to pension funds.
37.
Banking policies must animate the plan,
starting with the state banks. Strong bank
results will be tested as competitive pressures
intensify, with capital account liberalization
permitting alternatives to domestic deposits and
thus compressing net interest margins. The
government, with its overarching presence in the
system, must be a responsible steward. With the
state banks reporting sizable excess capital relative
to the regulatory capital floors, temptations to
extract large dividends will arise and must be
resisted, including to ensure that the liquidity rules
are respected. Bank disposal plans must look
beyond near-term fundraising, or even value
maximization, to finding the right owners.
Reputable foreign banks would be best, and
patience will be of the essence. In the interim,
arm’s length arrangements to ensure commercially
oriented management should be maintained.
38.
Concrete commitments are needed to
further improve microprudential oversight. The
IMF’s integrated approach to capital flow
liberalization ascribes considerable importance to
strengthening prudential regulation and
supervision. Iceland’s recent partial adoption of
the latest EU laws on bank supervision is a positive

step, albeit from a weak starting point. A 2014 assessment of Iceland’s observance of the Basel
Committee’s Core Principles for Effective Banking Supervision found Fjármálaeftirlitid (FME, the
banking, securities, and insurance regulator) lacking teeth and independence (Box 4). Noting the
forward steps taken since 2014, staff nonetheless urged the Act on Official Supervision of Financial
Activities be amended to increase supervisory powers and independence, even as work advances to
enhance the quality of risk based supervisory processes.
39.
A fundamental reform of the regulatory architecture could be considered. While the
primary reform objective must be to ensure that bank regulation and supervision have the requisite
legal powers and independence, there are also issues around the potential for conflicts, gaps, or
coordination failure given the involvement of two bodies in bank regulation—FME, responsible for
safety and soundness oversight, and the CBI, which applies the LCR and NSFR rules. Two earlier
official reviews, in 2009 and 2012, proposed centralizing safety and soundness oversight of banks at
the CBI. The 2012 review detailed a “twin peaks” model leaving regulation of nonbanks and markets,
as well as conduct of business oversight of banks (including consumer protection), at FME.
Box 4. Some Identified Challenges in Banking Oversight
Iceland’s banking crisis prompted calls, rightly, for a critical examination of bank regulation and
supervision. The first post crisis review, in 2009, made a number of far reaching recommendations, including
to reduce the number of ministries involved in financial market legislation; give more discretionary powers
to FME; and merge the CBI and FME. Some recommendations were implemented, yet many were not.
Persistent institutional weakness was confirmed by the Basel Core Principles assessment in 2014.
Among other things, the assessment identified several important legislative deficiencies.
The assessment pointed to insufficient rulemaking powers: “FME … is only allowed to issue rules if
explicitly commanded to do so by the legislation. This has seemingly led to the situation where FME relies
on the issuance of guidelines not only to clarify to the banks its supervisory expectations, but to detail and
interpret where law and regulation is too general. However, such guidelines are not legally binding.”
The assessment gave little comfort on regulatory and supervisory independence: “FME depends on the
Minister of Finance to put forward prudential legislation and regulation,” which “undermines the timeliness
of regulatory updates, and in practice may prevent FME from responding adequately if there are conflicting
interests between the government and prudential supervision.”
It also flagged a risk of coordination failure, especially in liquidity oversight: “While there is strong
cooperation between the CBI and FME, there are still gray areas regarding responsibilities … Whatever the
institutional arrangement decided by the authorities, it is important FME has the power … to supervise
individual banks’ liquidity risk compliance and management and apply adequate corrective actions early on.”

40.
One solution in the Icelandic context might be to unify safety and soundness oversight
of banks at the CBI. This, by placing prudential regulation and supervision of banks alongside the
lender of last resort function at the independent central bank, would limit the potential for conflicts,
gaps, or coordination failure and amount to a significant streamlining arguably well suited to a
country as small as Iceland. By leaving oversight of nonbanks, markets, conduct of business, and
consumer protection at FME, it would allow the CBI to focus on risks related to leveraged maturity
transformation while FME specialized in compliance and conduct. Staff acknowledged, however, that
change can be disruptive and that other solutions also warranted further study.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

19

ICELAND

41.
Other priorities include a stronger bank safety net. The recent Icesave settlement opens
the door to reforms of deposit insurance and bank resolution. Elements would include adopting the
EU guarantee limit of €100,000 per head (giving an insured deposit base of 40 percent of GDP),
clarifying emergency backstops, and ensuring the insurance fund is available to help finance bank
resolutions. The resolution statute should include early intervention powers, authority to replace
management and abrogate contracts, and the full range of intervention tools.
42.
Finally, staff encouraged further work on macroprudential policies and mooted
somewhat greater delegation of powers by parliament (Selected Issues). Systemic risks should be
understood to inform targeted use of tools, where resilience to exchange rate shocks should be a
core objective (Box 5). The CBI’s foreign currency LCR and NSFR floors are welcome steps, as are
recently adopted capital buffer requirements for banks. With loan to value caps for mortgages and
limits on unhedged foreign currency lending pending in parliament, staff suggested it could be
efficient if authority to introduce new instruments was delegated to the CBI and FME.
Box 5. Building a Macroprudential Toolkit
In Iceland, several macroprudential measures have already been adopted:
 Liquidity rules, by the CBI. LCR floors, both total and in foreign currency, took effect in December 2013,
followed by an NSFR floor, in foreign currency only, in December 2014. The LCR focuses on ensuring
adequate unencumbered liquid assets to fund liquidity drains over a 30 day horizon. The NSFR seeks to
encourage longer-term financing of long-term assets.
 Capital add ons, by FME. Phase ins are in train for a capital conservation buffer, a systemically important
financial institution buffer, a systemic risk buffer, and a countercyclical capital buffer. For the three main
banks, these will add up to 6 percent of risk weighted assets commencing April 2016, rising to
8½ percent by March 2017. This is in addition to the basic pillar 1 risk based regulatory capital floor of
8 percent and some of the (non public) pillar 2 supervisory capital requirements.
Work is ongoing to further augment the toolkit. Draft legislation currently before parliament proposes to
authorize loan to value and, possibly, debt service to income ceilings, as well as authority for the CBI, on the
recommendation of the Financial Stability Council, to limit foreign currency lending to unhedged parties.
Such instruments would help to address potential systemic risks arising from excessive credit growth and
asset price appreciation as well as credit risks specific to foreign currency lending.

43.
The authorities are offering offshore króna holders a last chance to exit. Agreeing with
staff on the merits of simplicity, they shall hold a targeted foreign exchange auction on June 16,
2016, after which their attention will resolutely turn to easing capital controls on residents.
Preparations, which include legislating a modified blocked accounts regime, were accepted as one
reason to not call parliamentary elections before the autumn. The authorities embrace a
conservative approach to reserve adequacy, which shapes the terms of their offer.
44.
There is commitment to lifting capital controls on residents. The authorities agree
liberalization should start with the pension funds, where exemptions would not require legislation
and significant easing could be effected over the summer. This could be followed by liberalizing
steps for households and firms starting in the autumn, although here Iceland would step beyond the
“comfort zone” of controllable processes, calling for a cautious strategy. Confidence will be central.
45.
The authorities agreed with staff on the importance of the financial sector legislative
agenda. They flagged that recent amendments to the Act on Financial Undertakings adopt most of
the new EU prudential rules for banks, with work underway to introduce provisions on supervisory
review and evaluation, authority to impose a leverage ratio, and definitions of related parties and
regulatory capital. It is hoped that the EU Bank Recovery and Resolution Directive can be transposed
by end 2016. FME thanked staff for advice to strengthen the Pension Fund Act and the Act on
Official Supervision of Financial Activities. It welcomed further study of options to reorganize the
architecture, reminding that until 1999 bank, market, and fund (but not insurance) oversight had
been in the CBI. FME opposed separating oversight of banks from that of funds, markets, and
insurance, however, arguing that keeping all under one roof offered synergies that would not be
available under a twin peaks structure.

STAFF APPRAISAL
46.
The outlook is for continued good performance, with growth accelerating initially,
then converging to around 2½ percent. Wage growth will probably lift inflation above target.
Further monetary tightening is assumed, striking a balance that keeps inflation in check and puts the
economy on a gently decelerating glide path. With eroding competitiveness and less favorable
terms of trade, the current account surplus shrinks steadily.
47.
The biggest risk is of another boom-bust. Popular demands for more fiscal spending are
becoming louder after years of restraint, and election season has arrived early. If the newly
reshuffled government, or indeed any successor administration, were to seek popularity through
spending, this would come on top of burgeoning wages and further stoke domestic demand at a
time when demand already risks being too strong. This would necessitate even larger interest rate
hikes than already envisaged. High interest rates, in turn, could attract carry trade inflows.
48.
Revamping the wage bargaining framework is important. The “dolphin leap” of
ratcheting wage awards since early 2015 increases the risk of overheating. The new Macroeconomic
Council, as a forum for discussions among social partners and policy makers, is a welcome step.
Reform efforts appropriately seek to anchor wage bargaining on competitiveness.
INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

21

ICELAND

49.
It is timely that the Organic Budget Law is in place to help maintain fiscal discipline.
Commitment to saving the receipts from the estates must remain firm. The new fiscal rules create a
multi-year guiding framework for fiscal policy, bringing in the municipalities. Compliance will build
credibility. Demand pressures call for a moderately tighter fiscal stance next year. Further reforms of
value added taxes should be considered to mobilize revenues and help adjust spending priorities.
50.
More monetary tightening will probably be needed. Iceland is enjoying an unusually long
period of price stability, giving the CBI increasing credibility. Irrespective of opposition from many
quarters, it is entirely correct that the Monetary Policy Committee should stand ready to raise
interest rates and consolidate this credibility. The economy is growing rapidly, wage growth will
likely push inflation above target, and ever-falling import prices cannot be assumed.
51.
The monetary policy framework would benefit from a clearly articulated intervention
policy. This should stress the primacy of the inflation target and re-emphasize there is no exchange
rate objective. Resisting appreciation can, perversely, generate market expectations of further
appreciation, so the best course is to focus squarely on inflation. It should also distinguish between
the separate goals of building reserves and countering disorderly market conditions. A conservative
approach to reserve adequacy is needed, especially while capital account liberalization is ongoing.
52.
Further capital account liberalization should be executed cautiously. The final effort to
resolve the offshore króna overhang is appropriate before attention turns to residents. Permitting
significantly more outward investment by pension funds is a logical first step for residents, and
should be matched by steps to strengthen governance and risk management provisions in the
Pension Fund Act. A strategy should be drawn up to calibrate the easing of restrictions on
households and firms. This should embed concrete commitments to further improve bank oversight.
53.
Policies need to adjust to the increased state presence in the banking system. It is vital
that the government be a responsible steward. Dividends should not unduly drain bank liquidity.
Privatization efforts should focus on finding high quality buyers. Legislative amendments should be
considered to strengthen FME. The involvement of two official bodies in bank regulation could be
revisited to address potential overlaps and gaps, bank liquidity and solvency being two sides of the
same coin. One solution in the Icelandic context might be to unify all safety and soundness
regulation and supervision of banks at the CBI, leaving oversight of nonbanks, markets, conduct of
business, and consumer protection at FME. This and other options warrant further study.
54.
Efforts to strengthen the macroprudential toolkit should press forward. Ideally bills
before parliament to establish loan to value caps on mortgages and limit unhedged foreign
currency lending would be passed soon. Work to develop effective capital flow management tools
should also proceed apace. In future, a more integrated approach could be considered where the
CBI and FME are given delegated authority to introduce new instruments by regulation.
55.
Staff recommends approval of the retention of Iceland’s exchange restrictions subject
to Fund jurisdiction under Article VIII, Section 2(a). The restrictions arise from the capital controls
regime Iceland continues to maintain which includes rules affecting the conversion and transfer of

22

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

ICELAND

(i) interest on bonds whose transfer the foreign exchange rules apportion depending on the period
of the holding, (ii) amortized principal on bonds, and (iii) the indexed portion of the principal on
bonds. Retention of the three restrictions was first approved by the Board on April 6, 2012 (Decision
No. 15133-(12/35)), with approval subsequently extended, most recently on March 3, 2016 (Decision
No. 15957- (16/19)). The authorities are of the view that retention of the measures is essential to the
continued success of their capital account liberalization strategy. Staff, finding these restrictions
necessary for balance of payments reasons, temporary, and nondiscriminatory, recommends their
retention be approved for a period of 12 months or until the completion of the next Article IV
consultation with Iceland, whichever is earlier.
56.
Staff recommends the next Article IV consultation with Iceland be held on the
standard 12 month cycle.

323 percent of GDP, which explains the step improvement in the net international investment position in 2015. In the IMF staff's methodology as used in the debt sustainability analysis, the bank
estates' external debt is calculated based on the assets of the estates (i.e., the write off is implicit in the external debt calculations).

Annex II. External Debt Sustainability Analysis
Iceland’s external debt path has improved sharply since the debt sustainability analysis (DSA) in the
Sixth Post-Program Monitoring review. The composition agreements among estate claimants,
which became binding in December 2015, eliminate the bulk of the old bank estates’ external debt.
Prior to the recent lifting of capital controls on the estates, debts attributed to
them formed about one third of Iceland’s external debt. The estates’ debts were calculated
by formula, apportioning their liquid assets (irrespective of location) as well as the “LBI
compensation bond” (a foreign currency claim of LBI on Landsbankinn) to their foreign creditors.
As of Q3 2015, the estates’ main remaining illiquid assets were Kaupthing and Glitnir’s shares in
Arion and Íslandsbanki, respectively. Staff’s previous baseline scenario assumed the disposal of
these holdings by 2016, increasing liquid assets and therefore external debt.

1.

The late 2015 composition agreements of the estates embedded write offs of about
80 percent of the face value of general claims. These write offs improve the net international
investment position by about 323 percent of GDP, but do not affect staff estimates of the estates’
external debt which are based, as noted, on the value of the estates’ assets. The “haircuts” for this
analytical concept of external debt are the “stability contributions” or the transfer of the estates’
domestic assets to the Icelandic state. As a share of the estates’ total assets, such haircuts were in
a range of 5–24 percent.
2.

The haircuts and asset distributions by the estates slash debt. With most of the
estates’ króna assets going to the government in 2016 and most of their foreign currency assets
abroad to be distributed to their predominantly foreign claimants in 2015 and 2016, the bulk of
their external debt is eliminated by 2017. What remains from 2017 on are the amortizing LBI
bond (issued in 2009) and two new bullet euro medium term notes (EMTNs) issued by Arion
Bank and Íslandsbanki to Kaupthing and Glitnir, respectively. The EMTNs reflect these two
estates’ decisions to refinance for up to seven years both their own foreign currency deposits in
the two banks and certain foreign currency claims of the state and the CBI on the banks.

3.

The balance of payments and external debt statistics record the impact of the
compositions based on the distribution profile of each of the estates. In practice, Glitnir
received its capital control exemption in December 2015 while Kaupthing and LBI received theirs
in January 2016. Impacts are best understood by asset type:
4.



Króna assets. Asset transfers from the estates to the government are worth about
15½ percent of GDP, in addition to which there are domestic costs and expenses
incurred by the estates during 2015 (including some 1.3 percent of GDP in financial levies
paid to the government). These so called stability contributions are recorded in Q1 2016
and are transactions that cut external debt but have no corresponding balance of
payments outflows (explaining the large residual in 2016). In addition, two of the estates
are permitted to exchange some 5½ percent of GDP worth of króna for foreign exchange

32 INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

ICELAND

to distribute abroad (the so called “foreign exchange credits”). These latter transactions
do show as balance of payments outflows.


Foreign assets. The release of liquid foreign assets to foreign claimants cuts debt
without any matching net outflow in the balance of payments. Some 95 percent of
Glitnir’s foreign assets were in liquid form when composition was agreed, that share
being closer to two thirds for Kaupthing and LBI. Only Glitnir actually distributed its liquid
foreign assets in 2015. Distributions by Kaupthing and LBI, including LBI’s final payment
to its priority creditors of about $1.6 billion, take place in 2016 (explaining the large
residual in 2016). The estates’ remaining illiquid foreign assets are assumed to be
liquefied and distributed (contemporaneously) to claimants over the medium term with
no further effect on external debt.

5.

Changes in the baseline debt path relative to the previous DSA are also driven by:



Prepayments of government debt during 2015. In Q3 2015, the Treasury bought back
almost half of the outstanding stock of its dollar denominated bond maturing in June
2016, equivalent to about $0.4 billion. In Q4, the CBI prepaid its outstanding obligations
to the IMF, about $0.3 billion, consolidating 11 separate repurchases that would
otherwise have fallen due October 2015–August 2016.



Improvements in macro assumptions. Relative to the Sixth Post-Program Monitoring
review, real growth over 2015–20 has been revised up by about 1 percentage point on
average. The path for the current account surplus over the same period is broadly
unchanged, reflecting strong service exports and broadly unchanged competitiveness
effects from the recent wage rounds. The projected króna–dollar exchange rate path
reflects a stronger króna compared to the previous report.

The noninterest current account balance needed to stabilize Iceland’s external debt
ratio is now a surplus of 1.6 percent of GDP, down from 5.1 percent of GDP previously.
External debt is thus expected to decline faster than previously projected, from 207 percent of
GDP at end 2014 to less than 100 percent of GDP by 2021. The debt structure is favorable, with
about 60 percent of the external debt of private debtors other than the failed bank estates
estimated to be FDI related as of end 2015.
6.

Stress tests suggest the projected downward path of total external debt is relatively
robust, although risks remain. With the exception of the depreciation scenarios, standard
shocks do not materially alter the trajectory. Remaining risks relate primarily to the ongoing
liberalization of capital controls and to any additional wage negotiations, where larger than
expected wage increases would hurt competitiveness, growth prospects, and debt sustainability.

1/ External debt includes recovered domestic and foreign assets of old banks.
2/ Derived as [r - g - r(1+g) + ea(1+r)]/(1+g+r+gr) times previous period debt stock, with r = nominal effective interest rate on external debt; r = change in domestic GDP deflator in US dollar terms, g = real GDP
growth rate, e = nominal appreciation (increase in dollar value of domestic currency), and a = share of domestic-currency denominated debt in total external debt.
3/ The contribution from price and exchange rate changes is defined as [-r(1+g) + ea(1+r)]/(1+g+r+gr) times previous period debt stock. r increases with an appreciating domestic currency (e > 0) and rising inflation
(based on GDP deflator).
4/ For projection, line includes the impact of price and exchange rate changes, inflows of extraordinary financing (and Fund repurchases), and external asset recovery of the old bank estates.
Unlike the last report, we no longer make assumptions on repayments to the old banks until we gain further clarity on the strategy to lift capital controls.
5/ Defined as current account deficit, plus amortization on medium- and long-term debt, plus short-term debt at end of previous period.
6/ The key variables include real GDP growth; nominal interest rate; dollar deflator growth; and both non-interest current account and non-debt inflows in percent of GDP.
7/ Long-run, constant balance that stabilizes the debt ratio assuming that key variables (real GDP growth, nominal interest rate, dollar deflator growth, and non-debt inflows in percent of GDP) remain at their levels
of the last projection year.
8/ Since interest payment projections exclude old bank related interest payments while the external debt stock includes old bank debt, this results in an understatement of the external interest rate.
Hence, for the computation of debt stabilizing current account we use the 2020 underlying interest rate that would exclude old bank debt stock as well.

Annex III. Public Debt Sustainability Analysis
Iceland’s public debt sustainability is projected to improve rapidly. The authorities are receiving
significant resources from the estates and are committed to saving them. With asset sales, net debt
should fall below the new statutory ceiling of 30 percent of GDP by around 2020. The debt
trajectory is robust to most shocks. In the case of a combined macroeconomic and contingent
liabilities shock, the debt ratio deteriorates in the short run before resuming its downward path.
Iceland’s debt sustainability indicators are projected to improve considerably over
the medium term. During the early part of 2016, the authorities expect to collect just over
16 percent of GDP from the bank estates, which will be used to reduce public debt. This will take
time, however, as a large share of these assets is illiquid. Iceland’s net debt ratio should fall below
the new statutory ceiling of 30 percent of GDP before the end of the projection period.
1.

Even excluding the large one off receipts from the estates, Iceland has in recent
years made impressive progress in unwinding liabilities accrued during the financial crisis.
Since the peak year of 2011, the gross debt ratio has fallen by around 30 percentage points of
GDP. At end 2015, the gross general government debt ratio was estimated to be just below
68 percent of GDP, compared to a pre crisis ratio of just below 29 percent in 2007.
2.

A significant share of recent government bond issuance has been used to build
foreign exchange reserves. Placing issuance proceeds at the CBI, the government has built up a
sizable stock of deposits. This is reflected in the widening difference between the gross and net
debt ratios over the last five years. At end 2015, net general government debt amounted to
51 percent of GDP. Going forward, the compositions of the failed bank estates will permit the
government to prudently reduce its deposits and thus accelerate the reduction of gross debt.
3.

During 2015, the government began to use its deposits to finance early repayment
of crisis related bonds. It accelerated the repayment of a large nonmarketable instrument that
was issued during the crisis to recapitalize the CBI. As of end 2015, the remaining balance on this
bond was ISK 90 billion (4 percent of GDP). It is expected that this will be paid in early 2016.
Separately, there is another nonmarketable bond, issued in 2009–12 to recapitalize financial
institutions. At end 2015, the balance on this bond was ISK 212 billion (10 percent of GDP). This is
projected to be paid in 2018 using government deposits and divestment proceeds.
4.

The structure of the public debt helps minimize fiscal risks. Around three quarters is
held domestically, mostly by banks and pension funds. Less than 2 percent is short term. Around
three quarters of central government debt is denominated in krónur, with most of the rest in
dollars or euros. About 85 percent of the stock carries fixed rates. The weighted average time to
maturity on central government debt is 6.7 years, or 4.4 years for the portion in foreign currency.
5.

However, a significant fiscal risk is posed by the large stock of government
guarantees issued to state owned enterprises. As of November 2015, the stock of state
guarantees was equivalent to about 50 percent of GDP, which is down from a peak of 81 percent

of GDP in 2009. Heightening fiscal vulnerabilities, around 84 percent of these guarantees are to
two entities, the Housing Financing Fund and Landsvirkjun (the national power company).
Landsvirkjun has been able to borrow without government guarantees.
The recently published medium term fiscal strategy has highlighted the importance
of addressing legacy pension issues. Iceland reformed its pension framework in 1997,
establishing a fully funded system for private sector workers and public sector workers hired after
1997. Serving public sector workers were given the option of moving to the newly established
fully funded system or remaining with the old pay as you earn system. The authorities estimate
that the old system has an unfunded liability of around 24 percent of GDP, which will need to be
met from 2030 onward. This liability, published annually by Statice and recorded as insurance
technical reserves in the general government balance sheet, is not included in debt
7.

Baseline and Realism of Projections
8.

This DSA uses staff’s macro framework and makes the following assumptions:



Fiscal outlook. In line with the new Medium Term Economic Program, the authorities
aim for a general government surplus of around 1 percent of GDP over the medium term.
This implies primary surpluses averaging 2½ percent of GDP in 2017–21. Coupled with
asset sales, drawdowns of government deposits, and a negative interest rate–growth
differential in most years, this puts the gross debt ratio on a firm downward trajectory.



Housing Financing Fund. The government makes sizable allocations to cover capital
shortfalls here, amounting to about 1 percent of GDP over four years.



Tax reform. In line with the 2016 budget, personal income tax reforms are assumed to
cost about ½ percent of GDP annually. The scenario also assumes modest cuts in social
security contributions and increased collections of excise revenues.



Debt management. Substantial divestment proceeds in 2016–21 are assumed to reduce
liabilities, with no rollover of outstanding domestic bonds as they come due.

The realism of staff’s baseline assumptions has improved over time. The median
forecast error for growth over 2005–13 was 0.3 percent. Staff tended to be overly pessimistic
about growth during the early years of this period and slightly optimistic during the crisis years.
More recent growth forecasts have been close to outturns. Inflation forecasts have been subject
to larger errors, particularly before and during the crisis. Again, recent forecast accuracy has
improved. The median forecast error for the primary balance shows a similar pattern of
pessimism turning to optimism with forecast accuracy improving in recent years.

9.

The heat map indicates that Iceland’s current debt levels do not pose high levels of
risk. The only potential area of concern is the external financing requirement, which shows
considerably above the upper threshold of the early warning benchmark. A large external bond
maturity in 2016 is assumed to be rolled over.

Shocks and Stress Tests
The DSA stress tests indicate a highly favorable medium-term outlook. Under all
shock scenarios, debt sustainability indicators recover relatively quickly. This is heavily
contingent, however, on the commitment to reduce liabilities using both government deposits
and the resources from the estates. This assessment also assumes that the commitment to fiscal
adjustment is sustained and the macroeconomic and external environment is relatively benign.
11.

Based on an asymmetric restriction of the shocks, the debt ratio peaks at around
80 percent of GDP with a 95 percent confidence interval. Six scenarios were considered:
12.



Growth shock. Real GDP growth is subjected to a one standard deviation negative
shock. Inflation is assumed to decline in line with lower growth, dropping ¼ percentage
point for every 1 percentage point decrease in growth. Reflecting higher risk premiums,
nominal interest rates rise by 25 basis points for every 1 percent of GDP worsening of the
primary balance. Under this scenario, the debt to GDP ratio remains broadly flat in 2017
but declines sharply thereafter as the authorities’ debt reduction strategy accelerates.



Interest rate shock. A 200 basis point increase in spreads is applied throughout the
projection period. The decline in the debt ratio decelerates modestly in 2017 relative to
the baseline but returns rapidly to its downward trajectory thereafter.



Real exchange rate shock. A 25 percent real exchange rate devaluation is applied in the
first year, coupled with a 25 basis point increase in interest rates for each 1 percent of
GDP reduction in the primary balance. The debt ratio increases slightly in 2017 but
returns to its downward trajectory thereafter. Overall, the impact of the shock is very
limited due to the large share of króna denominated debt.



Primary balance shock. A 2 percent of GDP decline in revenues is applied over two
years, coupled with a rise in nominal interest rates over the same period. The debt to
revenue ratio deteriorates but recovers quickly, with little deterioration in the debt ratio
relative to the baseline.



Combined macro fiscal shock. This scenario combines the shocks to real growth, the
interest rate, the real exchange rate, and the primary balance while eliminating double
counting of the effects of the individual shocks. The gross debt ratio spikes in 2017,
peaking at 72 percent of GDP, with the downward trajectory reestablished thereafter as
asset sales and privatizations go ahead as envisaged in the baseline.



Contingent liabilities shock. The assumption is that 10 percent of state guarantees are
called in 2016, with interest rates increasing by 25 basis points for every 1 percent of GDP
worsening in the primary balance. The primary balance deteriorates to a deficit of almost
7 percent of GDP in 2017 and interest rates increase by over 210 basis points, taking the
debt ratio to about 66 percent of GDP before it resumes its downward path thereafter.

Annex IV. Responses to Past Policy Recommendations
IMF 2014 Article IV Recommendations

Authorities’ Responses

Fiscal Policy

Consistent

Maintain Iceland’s core objectives of a balanced
budget and debt reduction. Proceed with value
added tax and personal income tax reforms. Enact
the proposed Organic Budget Law. Boost public
investment.

Monetary Policy
Stand ready to cut interest rates if imported
deflation persists. Conversely, be prepared to hike
rates if wage increases are larger than expected.
Continue reserve accumulation as conditions allow.
Maintain central bank independence.

Capital Controls
The updated liberalization strategy should be
comprehensive, conditions based, and with an
emphasis on a cooperative approach with
appropriate incentives.

The government recorded a small surplus in 2015. Large
receipts from the compositions of the estates will dominate the
fiscal position in 2016. However, small deficits will open up in
the outer years. The first of two stages of the value added tax
reform was completed in the 2015 budget. The personal income
tax reform will unfold in 2016–17. The Organic Budget Law was
passed in December 2015.
Consistent
The CBI raised rates in response to the large wage hikes, which,
together with significant imported deflation and currency
appreciation, has kept inflation below target. The CBI has
continued to build reserves amid favorable external conditions.
Proposed amendments to the CBI legislation as submitted by an
experts committee would preserve the current governance
structure and improve checks and balances.
Consistent
The updated liberalization strategy released in June 2015 takes
a staged approach. The bank estates were resolved first, in a
cooperative manner, which minimized legal and reputational
risks and won credit rating upgrades. The authorities are now
working to release offshore króna investments via an auction.
Residents will be addressed thereafter.

Financial Sector

Partly Consistent

Gaps in bank supervision and safety nets must be
addressed. Banks should continue to maintain
strong capital and liquidity buffers. The deposit
insurance, bank resolution, and emergency liquidity
assistance frameworks should be strengthened. The
Housing Financing Fund should be put in run off.

The authorities are stepping up efforts to improve supervisory
processes. However, major weaknesses persist, as detailed in
the 2014 Basel Core Principles assessment, with many rooted in
FME’s dependence on the Ministry of Finance. Banks are liquid
and well capitalized, although large dividends payouts are a
risk. The loss making Housing Financing Fund continues to lend
and draft housing bills propose it remain operational.
Partly Consistent

Structural
Follow through on plans to support productivity and
competitiveness.

44

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

Work by the Growth Forum continues to improve productivity.
However, the large wage hikes undermine competitiveness,
calling for a revamp of the wage bargaining framework.

Exchange Rate Arrangement and Exchange Restrictions:
The de jure exchange rate arrangement is free floating. In 2015, the Central Bank of Iceland (CBI)
continued to follow the strategy of increased foreign exchange market intervention as set forth by
the Monetary Policy Committee in May 2013. CBI transactions accounted for about 55 percent of
total market turnover in 2015, up from 43 percent in 2014, and total turnover increased by around
80 percent y/y. The objective of the intervention strategy is to mitigate short-term exchange rate

volatility and expand the CBI’s reserves as much as conditions allow. Exchange rate volatility
diminished significantly after the strategy was announced. The de facto exchange rate arrangement
is classified as a floating arrangement. The CBI publishes monthly data on its interventions in the
foreign exchange market. Iceland has accepted the obligations under Article VIII, Sections 2(a),
3, and 4 but maintains exchange restrictions arising from limitations imposed on the conversion and
transfer of (i) interest on bonds whose transfer the foreign exchange rules apportion depending on
the period of the holding, (ii) amortized principal on bonds, and (iii) the indexed portion of principal
on bonds. The retention of the three exchange restrictions was last approved by the Executive Board
on March 3, 2016 (Decision No. 15957-(16/19)). Iceland also has in place measures that constitute
exchange restrictions imposed for security reasons based on UN Security Council Resolutions.
Safeguards Assessment:
The 2009 Safeguards Assessment concluded that the overall control environment for the CBI was
broadly appropriate for a small central bank, with good controls in the areas of accounting and
financial reporting. The CBI's external and internal audit procedures were not found to be in line
with international practices, however, and the assessment noted that the foreign reserves
management area would benefit from further development. The authorities have since taken steps
to implement the recommendations, notably by appointing an international audit firm to conduct
annual external audits of the CBI in line with international standards, establishing an internal audit
function, and appointing a Chief Audit Executive per the board approved charter. New reserve
management guidelines were approved in 2012. Work on the remaining recommendation—
amendments to the Central Bank Act—remains in progress.
Last Article IV Consultation:
Discussions for the 2014 Article IV Consultation were held in Reykjavik during December 8–18, 2014.
The Staff Report (Country Report No. 15/72) was considered by the Executive Board on
March 9, 2015. Article IV consultations with Iceland are currently held on a 12 month cycle.

STATISTICAL ISSUES
A. Assessment of Data Adequacy for Surveillance
General. Data provision to the Fund is adequate for surveillance purposes. Iceland subscribed to
the Special Data Dissemination Standard (SDDS) in 1996, and is in observance of the SDDS
specifications for coverage, periodicity, and timeliness, although it uses a flexibility option on the
timeliness and periodicity for the production index and the producer price index. Data on a wide
range of economic and financial variables are provided to the Fund in a timely manner during
and between consultations. In addition to periodic press releases, statistical information in
English is disseminated to the public through a range of monthly, quarterly, and annual
publications by three main institutions (the CBI, the Ministry of Finance and Economic Affairs, and
Statistics Iceland), and is available on their internet sites.
The composition agreements reached by the bank estates in late 2015 had large impacts on the
fiscal, monetary, and external sectors. The estates’ “stability contributions” are recorded in the
general government data on an accruals basis in 2016. The monetary data have been affected in
both 2015 and 2016. In the external sector, the compositions entailed a large step reduction in
the estates’ foreign liabilities in December 2015, and a reclassification of their remaining foreign
assets and liabilities from “deposit money banks in winding up proceedings” (which no longer
exists as a category) to “financial holding companies”—both classified in the balance of
payments (BOP) and international investment position (IIP) under “Other sectors – other financial
corporations”.

National accounts. The existing methodological framework for producing national accounts
data was replaced in September 2014 with the new European System of Accounts (ESA) 2010 and
the data starting in 1997 were revised. The expenditure based GDP data are available by
component on a quarterly basis. Nonetheless, there is still scope for improvement of the national
accounts data:


Income accounts by sector are not sufficiently detailed and available only on an annual basis
with a significant lag; and



Production based GDP or gross value added by industry are available only on an annual basis
in nominal terms with a considerable lag.

Collection of the data on construction can be improved, because as of now the data is subject to
substantial data revisions, which complicates assessment of quarterly growth.
Price statistics. Data provision is adequate for surveillance.
Government finance statistics. The authorities publish a Treasury cash flow statement on a
monthly basis, quarterly data on general government operations, and annual data on general
government operations and financial assets and liabilities. Iceland reports government finance
statistics in accordance with the Government Financial Statistics Manual (GFSM) 2014 framework
in the Government Financial Statistics (GFS) Yearbook, and is an up to date contributor to the
International Financial Statistics (IFS).
Monetary and financial statistics. The concepts and definitions broadly conform to the
guidelines of the Monetary and Financial Statistics Manual (MFSM). The CBI reports detailed
monetary (CBI and deposit money bank) balance sheet data promptly on a monthly frequency.
Financial sector surveillance. Iceland does not report financial soundness indicators to STA.
External sector statistics. Since 2014, the CBI has compiled BOP and IIP data according to the
6th edition of the Balance of Payments and International Investment Position Manual (BPM6).
The BoP data do not provide a breakdown of services before 2013.
B. Data Standards and Quality
Subscriber to the SDDS since June 1996. Uses
SDDS flexibility options on the periodicity and
timeliness of the industrial production index.

A data ROSC was disseminated in November
2005.

STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2016 ARTICLE IV CONSULTATION—
SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION
Prepared by

European Department

This supplement updates the staff report (SM/16/126) and appraisal.
On June 2, 2016, the Althing legislated to permit the imposition of a reserve
requirement on selected capital inflows. Amendments to the Foreign Exchange Act
vest such authority in the Central Bank of Iceland (CBI). Selected flows may be subject to
a reserve ratio of up to 75 percent, with the resulting reserve amount to be deposited,
for a holding period up to five years, in a deposit institution in Iceland. The deposit
institution, in turn, shall deposit such amount in a reserve account at the CBI.
On June 4, the CBI issued rules activating the tool, which was announced as a
capital flow management measure (CFM). The reserve base, as further detailed,
comprises foreign currency debt flows entering Iceland after June 4, most of which come
through the New Investment Route introduced in late 2009 (these inflows are issued
with “yellow tickets” exempting them from capital controls). The special reserve ratio is
set at 40 percent, the holding period at 12 months, and the interest rate on the reserve
accounts at the CBI at nil. FDI, investments in listed and unlisted equities and in real
estate, and flows restricted under the capital control regime are unaffected.
The stated purpose of the action is to curb incentives for a new carry trade. By
taxing inflows, in effect, the authorities seek to temper them and influence their
composition, thereby reducing risks to macroeconomic and financial stability. Iceland
has telegraphed that, while it remains committed to lifting capital controls, it shall do so
on its terms—its priority is not foreign investment in a shrinking stock of public debt, but
rather steps to let out bottled up domestic savings, consistent with the current account
surplus. Seeing no sign of overlap between yellow ticket and FDI investors, the
authorities assess the impact on TFP enhancing inflows to be limited.
On timing, the authorities point to bitter past experience and argue an ounce of
prevention is better than a pound of cure. Characterizing recent inflows as significant,
they apprehend also that legacy offshore króna investments that exited via the CBI’s
auction could return using the yellow ticket route, replacing an immobilized overhang
with a dynamic and potentially flighty one, complicating the liberalization of capital
controls on residents. The auction has thus been one factor driving their timing.
The authorities have also been candid that there is a monetary policy dimension.
The recent capital inflows have hurt transmission to long-term rates. The CBI Governor
has argued for tools aimed at giving monetary policy more room for maneuver,

ICELAND

Staff also considers the reserve requirement a CFM
as defined in the Fund’s Institutional View. Staff had
noted circumstances could arise where CFMs form part
of an efficient policy response in Iceland, and had
pointed the authorities to the Institutional View. The
guidance therein emphasizes the central role of
macroeconomic policies in managing the risks
associated with inflow surges, yet notes CFMs can be
useful in certain circumstances. Such measures, if used,
should be transparent, targeted, temporary, and
nondiscriminatory and should not substitute for
warranted macroeconomic adjustment.

Separately, the latest national account and price data are consistent with staff’s baseline
projections. Real GDP expanded by 4.2 percent y/y in Q1, with domestic demand surging
8.3 percent y/y, led by private consumption (up 7.1 percent) and fixed investment (up 24.5 percent).
CPI inflation was 1.7 percent in May, with inflation excluding housing coming in at 0.3 percent.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

Statement by Kimmo Tapani Virolainen, Alternate Executive Director for Iceland
and Gudrun Soley Gunnarsdottir, Advisor to Executive Director
June 20, 2016
The Icelandic authorities appreciate the candid and constructive discussions during the 2016
Article IV Mission in Reykjavík and Akureyri.
My authorities broadly agree with the staff appraisal and recommendations. The economic
recovery has gained momentum in recent years. The economic slack created during the deep
recession that came in the wake of the financial crisis has disappeared and possible
overheating of the economy has become an important risk. The fiscal accounts are in surplus
territory and public debt as a share of GDP has been reduced substantially, helped by
economic growth, fiscal consolidation, and lately, stability contributions from the bank
estates that were intended to mitigate potential negative balance of payments effects. The
economy is relatively well balanced with a sizeable current account surplus and inflation
somewhat below target for over two years. However, inflation expectations, although falling,
are not yet anchored at the target. This partly reflects forecasts that indicate inflation might
rise above target next year as sizeable wage increases and a positive output gap have their
effect and international deflationary forces might be on the wane. As a result of the sizable
current account surpluses in the post-crisis period and the compositions of the bank estates,
the NIIP has greatly improved, towards about minus 6 percent of GDP at end 2015. The NIIP
will turn positive in the near future if current account surpluses continue to persist as
forecast.
Economic growth is projected to be between 4 and 5 percent this year and easing slightly
next year. A rapid increase in tourism has been the main engine of growth, also fueling
consumption and investment in hotels and tourist facilities. At the same time, the important
fishing sector enjoys high external demand and good catches, the tech sector enjoys robust
growth and investment in the energy sector continues at a measured pace. Financial system
resilience has continued to increase in tandem with private sector deleveraging and banks’
strengthening their capital positions. Downside risks to the outlook include, as staff points
out, effects from wage increases far in excess of the sum of productivity growth and the
inflation target, the impact of potential premature capital account liberalization, financial
imbalances, and weaker demand for exports in trading partner countries. However, the
authorities intend to manage the downside risks with planned reforms and prudential policies.
Fiscal policy
Fiscal easing in 2015 and 2016 calls for some tightening in 2017 and balance onwards in
accord with the newly introduced Organic Budget Law (OBL). Reforms of the personal
income tax system will continue and there remains scope to make the indirect tax system,
including the VAT, more efficient. Public investment is just below 3 percent of GDP and has
not reached the levels seen before the banking collapse. There is a need for infrastructure
investments, including in transport and the health care system. Some of this need arises from
the sharp increase in tourism and must be undertaken to build capacity to accommodate the

2
projected growth of the tourism sector. However, the authorities stand firm on not departing
from the policy to use the windfall from the settlement of the failed bank estates to lower
public debt. Consequently, the debt ceiling in the OBL was lowered from 45 percent of GDP
to 30 percent prior to the legislation being passed, which seems well within reach.
Staff mentions the rise in disability outlays and social protection spending. The Organic
Budget Law will in a way act as a ring fencer in this regard alongside actions to target
spending to those most in need. The largest municipality, Reykjavik, has already made
significant progress in reducing outlays for social protection, including through successful
rehabilitation programs. Sales of the state owned banks will proceed but the lessons from the
privatization of the banking system at the turn of the century are still in memory and the
lessons learned will be applied to ensure that the banks will be responsibly managed. The
Parliament has recently passed a new law that will help to remove bottlenecks in the housing
market where young people have been hard pressed to obtain suitable accommodation,
whether by renting or purchasing. The associated fiscal cost will be acceptable as more
choices for new entrants in the housing market will help to lower the risk of house price
imbalances, inter alia due to demand from the tourist sector.
Monetary policy and financial stability
Inflation expectations have become better aligned with the inflation target as inflation has
been at or below the target for over two years. Nevertheless, work is still needed to anchor
them more firmly. This is not surprising given the legacy of high and volatile inflation in
Iceland. The Central Bank of Iceland (CBI) will use the necessary means to achieve such
anchoring as it is a pre-requisite for successfully keeping inflation at target over the medium
term. The CBI has already signaled that a policy rate increase might be in the cards later this
year if inflation starts to rise.
There have been significant inflows of short term capital to take advantage of relatively high
interest rates in Iceland. Such flows proved to be very destabilizing in the period leading up
to the banking crisis, also interfering with the interest rate channel of monetary policy.
Recently passed legislation has given the CBI the power to apply a special reserve
requirement on specific capital inflows. From June 4th portfolio debt inflows, most of which
are registered as new domestic investment and receive a so-called “yellow ticket” making
them exempt from the capital controls, will be subject to a 40 percent one-year
unremunerated reserve requirement (max. 75 percent for five years according to the
legislation). This is structured to dampen the return on speculative short term investments
without deterring capital inflows directed into long term investment. The policy measure is
also intended to support other aspects of domestic economic policy, including monetary
policy, thereby contributing to economic stability.
The authorities agree with staff on the need to strengthen financial system regulation and
supervision. Capital requirements should be proportionate to the risk profile of individual
banks and take into account systemic risk factors through appropriate macro-prudential
policies. The macro-prudential toolkit is still being developed and staff´s suggestions are

welcome in this context. The implementation of the EU Capital Requirements Directive IV
and Capital Requirements Regulation is an ongoing process and capital buffers were
introduced into Icelandic legislation last winter. In January, the Financial Stability Council
(FSC) issued a recommendation to the Financial Supervisory Authority (FSA) regarding
imposing the Systemic Risk Buffer, the Buffer on Systemically Important Institutions and the
Countercyclical Capital Buffer. The FSA made a decision in accordance with the Council’s
recommendation and this will increase capital requirements for systemically important
financial institutions by up to 6.5 percentage points. Last year the FSA obtained new
supervisory powers, e.g. with regard to risk management, and bills of legislation have been
introduced before Parliament which would allow the FSA to set caps on loan-to-values for
mortgages and the CBI to set limits on unhedged foreign currency lending. Additionally, a
working group consisting of representatives from the Ministry of Finance, the FSA and the
CBI has been established to review the Law on Financial Undertakings with the objective of
reducing systemic risk resulting from universal banks and systemically important financial
institutions.
Capital account liberalization
Capital account liberalization is proceeding according to plan. The offshore króna overhang
from the glacier bond era now constitutes around 13 percent of GDP. To prevent
destabilizing rapid outflow of these assets, offshore króna assets were ring-fenced with
special legislation. Tomorrow, the CBI will hold one final auction to give the offshore króna
holders the option of an exit before the Icelandic authorities turn to lifting capital controls on
domestic residents. Offshore króna holders who choose not to participate in the auction will
continue to face limited investment options consisting of bank deposits, Central Bank
certificates of deposits and treasury bills. Following the demarcation of the offshore krónas
and the containment of the overhang, the process towards full liberalization of capital
controls on domestic parties will be executed in carefully measured steps. The authorities
welcome the discussion in the Selected Issues paper that gives consideration to some of the
problems related to capital flows, financial stability, and monetary policy.
The labor market and structural reforms
Staff correctly associates the very high wage increases last year with possible overheating
and inflation pressures. A new Macroeconomic Council with labor market participants and
fiscal and monetary authorities represented will help to create consensus on rational wage
setting based on competitiveness in the future.
With the progress made towards lifting capital controls through the composition agreements
of the estates of the fallen banks and by containing the offshore króna overhang the
authorities can turn to structural reforms in various sectors of the economy. These include the
educational and health systems as well as the rapidly growing tourist sector where
environmental considerations and capacity developments must go hand in hand. The
authorities welcome the discussion and proposals in the Selected Issues paper covering
expenditure policies related to the above issues.
