ECF arrangement: The Executive Board approved Ghana’s three-year ECF arrangement on July 15,
2009, with access of SDR 387.45 million (105 percent of quota). First and second reviews under the
arrangement were concluded on June 9, 2010.
Outcome of the 3rd and 4th ECF Reviews: Quantitative performance targets were met throughout 2010
for net international reserves, external arrears, inflation, and new external nonconcessional borrowing.
However, the cash deficit and domestic arrears targets were missed for December 2010. Seven of the
twelve structural benchmarks applicable since June 2010 were implemented, with the other five partially
implemented or delayed. Despite fiscal slippage, the ECF contributed significantly to adjustment and
reform achievements. With reinforcement of the fiscal program and a favorable first quarter 2011 outturn,
staff recommends completion of the 3rd and 4th reviews.
Discussions: Discussions for the ECF reviews were held in Accra during September 20–October 1 and
December 8–16, 2010, and completed with the discussions for the 2011 Article IV consultation during
February 16–March 1, 2011. The staff team comprised Messrs. Allum (head), Kovanen, Kpodar, and
Lonkeng Ngouana (AFR), and Jarmuzek and Ms. Nkhata (SPR). The mission was supported by
Mr. Mitchell (resident representative). Mr. Mojarrad (ED) and Ms. Hagan (advisor to ED) joined the
discussions. The missions met with President Atta Mills (December 2010), Vice President Mahama
(September 2010), Minister of Finance Duffuor, Bank of Ghana Governor Amissah-Arthur, other senior
officials, members of parliament, and representatives of the private sector, academia, civil society
organizations, and the donor community. Press releases were issued at the end of the September 2010 and
February 2011 missions.
Exchange regime: Ghana maintains a floating exchange rate regime and an exchange system free of
restrictions on payments and transfers for current international transactions. Ghana has accepted the
obligations of Article VIII, Sections 2, 3, and 4.
Publication: The Ghanaian authorities have consented to publication of this staff report, and their letter of
intent and memorandum of economic and financial policies.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
The economy recovered in 2010, expanding by 5½–6 percent after a temporary slowdown in 2009.
Exports were buoyant, as were construction and service activities. Inflation has been close to 9
percent since mid-2010, down from over 20 percent in 2009. Developments in Côte d’Ivoire and
Libya have had only a limited impact on Ghana’s economy, so far.
The start of oil production is projected to underpin 13 percent real GDP growth in 2011. Strong
non-oil activity would contribute to 6–7 percent growth in 2012 and beyond. Inflation is projected to
remain in single digits, provided fiscal and monetary policies are supportive.
The adjusted target for the cash fiscal deficit was missed by 0.8 percent of GDP in 2010. This
was largely due to expenditure overruns, which also contributed to an accumulation of payment
arrears equivalent to nearly 2 percent of GDP.
The implementation of structural reforms has been uneven. Debt management was strengthened
and the program’s external borrowing targets were met. At the same time, progress has lagged in
strengthening revenue administration, and expenditure and payroll management.
The government relaunched the fiscal consolidation effort in 2011. The program aims to reduce
the deficit to 4½ percent of GDP in 2011 and about 2½ percent of GDP beyond. A portion of Ghana’s
initial oil revenues is being saved and steps are being taken to strengthen tax collection and
expenditure management. Petroleum pump prices were increased to reflect higher costs. A strategy to
regularize payment arrears is being developed and a comprehensive database will be established to
facilitate monitoring of payment arrears. The March 2011 fiscal data are consistent with achieving the
planned full-year fiscal consolidation.
Article IV discussions focused on the conduct of monetary and exchange rate policies in the
context of a strong balance of payments. Staff supported Ghana’s intention to maintain its inflation
targeting and flexible exchange rate regimes; the currency was found to be broadly in line with
fundamentals. Monetary policy needs to be alert to upside inflation risks from resumed strong
liquidity growth, global commodity price increases, and rising domestic activity.
Significant progress has been made in implementing recommendations of the 2010 FSAP
update. Payments to clear domestic arrears and energy sector debts have reduced immediate stability
risks and instances of bank undercapitalization have been significantly reduced. But key sources of
vulnerability identified by the FSAP remain. Efforts are needed to resolve weak banks, ensure
compliance with regulations, improve corporate governance in banks, and strengthen banks’
accounting and risk management practices.
Key risks under the program relate to the planned fiscal adjustment. Efforts underway to
strengthen expenditure controls will need to be sustained. With rising global commodity prices,
domestic energy pricing needs to be kept under close review, to avoid the re-emergence of costly
subsidies.

I. INTRODUCTION
1.
Ghana has been implementing adjustment policies under the Extended Credit
Facility (ECF) since the July 2009 Article IV consultations. External adjustment was
achieved relatively early in the program, supported by fiscal tightening and currency
adjustment during 2009. Buoyant cocoa and gold prices helped Ghana ride out the global
financial crisis and, over the past year, financing constraints have eased as nonresident
demand for domestic currency bonds re-emerged. The start of oil production in late-2010
has further reinforced the fiscal and external outlook. The emphasis in the remainder of
Ghana’s ECF-supported adjustment program is on relaunching the fiscal adjustment effort
after slippages in 2010, tackling long-standing weaknesses in fiscal institutions, and
addressing vulnerabilities that have emerged in the banking sector.
2.
Implementation of the adjustment program has not been straightforward. The
first ECF review was completed with the second review only after additional measures were
identified in early-2010 to reinforce that year’s budget, and the third review was delayed and
is being combined with the fourth review only after policies were agreed to strengthen fiscal
policies for 2011 and beyond. Box 1 summarizes Ghana’s responsiveness to the
2009 Article IV recommendations.

Box 1. Responses to Fund Advice
Fiscal policy: The 2009 Article IV consultation urged fiscal consolidation through revenue
mobilization and expenditure restraint, with steps to control public wage growth and
increase power tariffs. Goals for revenue collections and power tariffs were met, but
spending ran ahead of plans and the wage bill was increased by a new pay structure. A
large part of initial oil revenues is being saved, as recommended in the 2009 Article IV.
Monetary and exchange rate policy: In line with Fund advice, the authorities further
tightened monetary policies during 2009 and banking sector surveillance was the focus of
the 2010 FSAP update. Currency flexibility was maintained, as advised.
Structural reforms: Structural fiscal reforms were launched in 2009 as recommended, but
progressed more slowly in 2010 for diverse reasons.

II. RECENT DEVELOPMENTS AND PROGRAM PERFORMANCE
3.
Growth is recovering, and incomes per capita have been substantially revised.
On rebased national accounts data,1 the economy is estimated to have expanded by 5½–
6 percent in 2010, after a period of slower growth (4.7 percent) in 2009. Growth is being
driven by buoyant commodity exports and increased construction and service activities. In
the rebased accounts, recent annual growth rates have been revised up by an average of
1 percent, in part reflecting the rapid growth of services that now account for one-half of the
economy. The level of incomes has been dramatically revised, increasing by an average of
65 percent for 2006–09, putting Ghana into the lower-middle income country grouping
(Figures 1 and 2).
4.
External performance has been favorable. Total exports grew by US$2 billion in
2010, with cocoa and gold exports benefiting from high global commodity prices. Imports
also staged a strong recovery after a decline in 2009, partly reflecting capital goods imports
by the oil sector. The current account deficit of 7.2 percent of GDP in 2010 was more than
financed by strong capital inflows, including foreign direct investments in the oil sector and
bond purchases by nonresident investors. Net international reserve targets were met by wide
margins, and gross reserve cover rose to 3.2 months of import cover at end-2010 (Figure 3).
5.
A stable currency has helped the disinflation process. With a strong balance of
payments, the cedi has traded in a relatively narrow range since mid-2009. This, together
with the lagged effects of monetary tightening in 2009 and favorable crop yields, contributed
to a decline in inflation from a 20 percent annual rate in 2009 to about 9 percent from mid2010, close to the center of the ECF target band. With inflation remaining higher than in
partner countries, the real effective exchange rate appreciated by 6 percent during 2010.
6.
Cash fiscal deficit and domestic financing targets for end-December 2010 were
missed. The fiscal deficit (measured from financing side) exceeded the adjusted program
ceilings by 0.8 percent of GDP. Tax revenues exceeded programmed levels, but nontax
revenues and grants fell short, and expenditures exceeded program targets, mainly due to
higher capital spending. Poverty-reducing expenditure was safeguarded, with indicative
targets met throughout the year. The government raised new revenues in an effort to reduce
the end-year cash deficit slippage to less than 0.2 percent of GDP, but the incomes were

realized in January 2011, rather than in December 2010 as planned.2 The end-year indicative
target on net domestic financing of the budget was missed by 0.8 percent of GDP, in part
reflecting a slippage of a World Bank loan disbursement ($215 million, or 0.6 percent of
GDP) from 2010 into early 2011.
7.
Fiscal pressures also gave rise to expenditure arrears. On a full-year basis, arrears
were accumulated in 2010 in a net amount equivalent to 1.9 percent of GDP, compared to a
targeted reduction of 0.2 percent of GDP under the program, breaching the December
performance criteria on domestic arrears.3 The estimated commitment basis fiscal balance,
which adjusts the cash deficit for arrears accumulation, rose from 6.4 percent of GDP in 2009
to 8.4 percent of GDP in 2010, exceeding the adjusted program by 2.9 percent of GDP
(Figure 4).4
8.
Public debt ratios continued to edge higher in 2010. Total public debt was an
estimated 39 percent of GDP at end-2010, up 3 percentage points from 2009. Two-thirds of
this increase comprised higher domestic debt. The debt data exclude expenditure arrears and
central government liabilities for unpaid SOE debts, estimated at 9 percent of GDP at
end-2010.
9.
The monetary policy stance has been unchanged since mid-2010. With stable
inflationary pressures, the Bank of Ghana (BoG) policy rate has been held at 13.5 percent
since July 2010, following an easing from 18.5 percent in late-2009. Liquidity growth picked
up strongly in 2010, as the strong balance of payments boosted central bank NFA, despite
partial sterilization. Reserve money expanded 35 percent in 2010, while broad money rose
46 percent, both well above year-ago outturns. Private sector credit also picked up towards
end-2010 (Figure 5).

The government sold shares in a gold mining company received in lieu of royalty payments for an amount
equivalent to 0.7 percent of GDP.
3

Settlements of past arrears in 2010 (1.4 percent of GDP) were considerably exceeded by an additional
accumulation of arrears (3.3 percent of GDP).
4

The commitment basis deficit was almost 4 percentage points higher than the unadjusted 2010 target, i.e.,
before adjusting for higher-than-programmed foreign financed capital spending (see TMU adjusters).

10. The 2010 FSAP Update found that financial stability risks have heightened since
the 2003 FSAP. While, in the aggregate, the banking system is profitable and liquid with
high capital levels, NPL ratios are elevated, in part due to government payment arrears. The
2010 FSAP Update highlighted risks from extensive state involvement in the banking sector
and deficiencies in commercial banks’ risk management and accounting practices, shortfalls
in BoG supervision and systemic risk analysis, and weak enforcement of creditor rights.
11. Significant progress has been made in implementing the recommendations of the
2010 FSAP Update. Immediate stability risks have been reduced since mid-2010 by the
issue of government bonds to retire TOR exposure to GCB and by payments to partially
settle government arrears to contractors. At the same time, the incidence of bank
undercapitalization has been addressed, with banks raising capital or merging with stronger
banks to comply with the increased statutory minimum capital requirement that became
effective at end December 2010. Management of state owned banks has been strengthened
to improve corporate governance, and some progress has been made in strengthening micro
and macro prudential regulation and supervision. In addition, the Financial Sector Strategic
Plan is being updated to integrate the recommendations of the FSAP into a comprehensive
reform program. Nevertheless, key sources of vulnerabilities remain and a sustained and
comprehensive reform effort is needed to achieve long term financial stability.
12. Seven of twelve structural benchmarks for the pending ECF reviews were fully
implemented (MEFP, Appendix Table 3). These covered VAT administration and oil and
gas revenue management, debt management, power pricing, and public sector reform
(subvented agencies and the state oil refinery). A remaining five benchmarks were delayed
or partially implemented, covering computerization of payrolls and the broader budget,
revenue authority modernization, strengthening of GCB’s balance sheet, and a review of tax
exemptions and waivers.
III. POLICY DISCUSSIONS AND THE 2011 PROGRAM
A. Growth Prospects
External and growth prospects are favorable, driven by high commodity export prices and
the start of oil production. Spillovers from regional conflicts have been manageable, so far.
13.
The medium-term outlook is generally good, assuming that fiscal vulnerabilities
are addressed. Ghana emerged as a new oil producer in late-2010, and yields from the
current Jubilee field are projected to stabilize at about 110,000 bpd during 2011–15
(implying annual export earnings of about $4 billion, at current oil prices). If two other fields
prove commercially viable, oil production could rise further after 2015, which, together with
the commercial exploitation of gas reserves, could imply stronger growth and exports than in
the baseline for this report. With non-oil growth in the 6–7 percent range, the start of oil
production is projected to boost growth temporarily to the 13 percent range in 2011. Inflation

14
is projected to edge lower over the medium term, supported by the Bank of Ghana’s inflation
targeting regime (Text Table 1).
14.
Continued external strength is anticipated. Current account deficits are projected
to narrow over the medium term reflecting the projected fiscal consolidation, rising oil
production, and high global commodity prices for gold and cocoa. Gross reserve cover could
rise to 6 months of imports by end-2015, providing an increased cushion to manage growing
transactions on the capital account.
15.
Risks to growth largely stem from the budget. Unless arrears are successfully
regularized, they would pose risks to corporate liquidity and banking portfolios. Equally, if
fiscal imbalances are not addressed, large financing needs could fuel inflation and currency
instability; these, in turn, would undermine the business climate and prospects for attracting
new investments to diversify Ghana’s economic base.

Assuming no further accumulation of new arrears from 2011 and clearance of existing arrears by 2014.
Net debt declines more significantly than gross debt during 2011-2015 due to the accumulation of savings in
an oil stabilization fund and future generations fund.

16.
The government has adopted a new growth and development strategy for
2010-13. The Ghana Shared Growth and Development Agenda (GSGDA) focuses on support
for agriculture, private sector development, infrastructure, human development, and natural
resource management. The potential 4-year implementation of the GSGDA has been costed
at 67 percent of GDP, with about one-half of this amount unfunded under the medium-term
budget. It will be difficult to fill the resource gap from external sources, and even if this were
achieved, it would have significant implications for macroeconomic stability and inflation.5
5

In the context of a scaling-up exercise for Ghana that was conducted in 2009, a 4½ percent of GDP per year
increase in foreign aid inflows was assumed, roughly half of what is envisioned in the GSGDA. In the analysis
the impact of the higher aid inflows was considered manageable.

15
Therefore, prioritization of the GSGDA program will be needed to ensure that the poverty
strategy is consistent with sound macroeconomic policies.
B. Fiscal Strategy and Risks
Discussions focused on how to re-launch Ghana’s fiscal consolidation program, after a
setback in 2010.
17. The program seeks a substantial fiscal correction in 2011. The program targets a
fiscal correction of 5 percentage points of GDP on a commitment basis in 2011, up from the
3 percentage points envisaged in the last review (Text Figure 1 and Text Table 2). Despite
this, both the cash and commitment basis deficits in 2011 would be 2 percentage points of
GDP higher than anticipated earlier, owing to the 2010 fiscal slippage (Text Table 1). Box 2
describes how arrears payments are incorporated in the fiscal projections.

Other potential liabilities. No provision has currently been made for SOE liabilities tentatively
estimated at 2.3 percent of GDP in 2011. This amount is an upside risk to the baseline fiscal deficit
and debt projections, though these liabilities could be substantially reduced as a result of audits, or by
payments by the SOEs themselves.

17
18. The government’s fiscal adjustment strategy hinges on relatively strong gains
from improved tax administration and much more effective spending control. On the
revenue side, oil revenues have been revised down for 2011 since the last review
(Text Table 2), but only a small part will be reflected in additional spending, contributing
importantly to the 2011 fiscal adjustment. The program also seeks to boost non-oil incomes
through new tax measures and a reinforced emphasis on revenue administration (see
Section III.C). Non-tax revenues also benefit from gold shares sold in early-2011. Based on
much tighter expenditure management (Section III.D), the program seeks sizeable savings in
investment outlays, focused on those projects that have previously given rise to expenditure
arrears. With an end to arrears-based financing of investment programs in 2011, spending is
reduced by a projected two percentage points of GDP on a commitment basis. Savings in
recurrent spending are no longer in prospect for 2011, because of an upward revision in
transfers due to the social security system.
19. For 2012–13, the program targets primary surpluses. With further increases in oil
incomes, tight expenditure control, and declining arrears payments, the program aims to
reduce the cash basis deficit from 4½ percent of GDP in 2011 to the 2–2½ percent of GDP
range in 2012–13, consistent with primary surpluses of about 1 percent of GDP. This would
steadily reduce both net and gross public debt levels in relation to GDP (Text Table 1).
20. Staff highlighted the risks of basing fiscal adjustment plans in large part on
strengthened revenue administration and spending control. The latter, in particular, has
underperformed in the past, and reforms are at an early stage. During discussions, the
mission urged, instead, a stronger reliance on tax increases, where the fiscal impact was
more predictable. In particular, staff saw merit in higher taxation of petroleum products
(where taxes are lower than in neighboring countries, and where Ghanaian collections have
fallen by 1.5 percentage points of GDP between 2006 and 2010); alternatively,
consideration could be given to raising the VAT rate from 15 to 18 percent, in line with
many African countries.
21. The authorities noted that the March 2011 fiscal outturns are consistent with
full-year goals for fiscal consolidation. Accordingly, they did not see a need for substantial
new taxes at this stage. Non-oil tax revenues surged 40 percent in the year to the first quarter
of 2011, substantially exceeding the 24 percent program target for 2011 as a whole. The
strong growth mainly reflected higher customs collections of VAT and trade taxes after tax
administration was strengthened. Over the same period, non-interest current expenditure
rose by 8.5 percent, well below the provision for 18 percent growth for 2011 as a whole. As
a result, the cash basis deficit stood at 1.1 percent of GDP in the first quarter of 2011
(4½ percent annual rate), down from 2.1 percent of GDP in the first quarter of 2010
(8½ percent annual rate).
22.
The government also warned that substantially higher taxes could undermine
social cohesion. The government noted the domestic political realities (the 2008 election

18
results were close, primary elections are held this summer, and national elections in 2012).
Moreover, although Ghana has not been severely affected by rising global food prices, social
tensions have been inflamed by higher oil prices, with protests after a 30 percent step
increase in petroleum pump prices in January 2011 (from the equivalent of $2.90 to
$3.80/gallon). Moreover, conflict in neighboring countries and North Africa has influenced
the political and economic debate—though economic spillovers have been limited so far
(Box 3).
Box 3. Spillovers from Conflict in Côte d’Ivoire and Libya and Global Developments
Cote d’Ivoire. As of mid-April, more than 11 thousand Ivorian refugees had sought refuge in
Ghana, and Ghana is working with the UNHCR to identify funding. Broader economic spillovers
from the conflict have been limited. Côte d’Ivoire represents less than one percent of Ghana’s total
export market, and financial ties are weak. Ghanaian banks have no correspondent relationships
with Ivorian banks, and have been largely unaffected by their closure.
Libya. By late-March, more than 16 thousand Ghanaians had been evacuated from Libya. The
repatriation could reduce Ghana’s remittance earnings, which exceeded 6 percent of GDP in 2010.
Support for reintegrating expatriate workers into the Ghanaian economy is being sought from
development partners, including humanitarian agencies.
Global developments. Favorable harvests have sheltered Ghana from rising global food prices so
far. Ghana’s cocoa sector is benefiting from the surge in global cocoa prices, with the increase
between December 2010 and February 2011 boosting projected 2011 exports by more than
$250 million (0.7 percent of GDP).

23. The risks to the fiscal program require more quick-acting contingency plans
than were in place in 2010. Accordingly, the government has established an unallocated
reserve equivalent to 1 percent of GDP within the expenditure program; this will be the first
source of savings, if cuts are needed (MEFP ¶37). The government underlined that further
savings could be achieved, as necessary, by delaying or scaling back investment projects.
On the revenue front, the government is well advanced in discussions on mining operations
that could yield non-tax revenues of 0.3 percent of GDP or more, and anticipates substantial
incomes from the transfer of mining and drilling rights during 2011. These revenues have
not been included in the baseline fiscal framework, and will be saved as they accrue, to
create a further cushion against fiscal shocks.
C. Steps to Improve Tax Collections
Discussions focused on how tax policy and revenue administration could help close the gap
between tax collections in Ghana (14 percent of GDP) and peer countries (around
20 percent of GDP).

19
24. The government is redoubling efforts to boost Ghana’s low tax yields in 2011
(MEFP, ¶20–24). A number of steps were taken in the 2011 budget. The national
stabilization levy (a temporary profit tax) was extended through 2011 and the coverage of
the communication service tax was extended (combined yield of 0.2 percent of GDP). As
supplementary measures, the government will seek parliamentary approval to extend the
VAT to fee-based financial services effective from July 2011, based on legislation
submitted to parliament in May 2011 (submission is a prior action for the completion of the
third and fourth ECF reviews). It is also tightening tax enforcement and raising the
presumptive taxation of the self-employed. The VAT extension and enhanced taxation of
the self-employed have a combined full-year yield of 0.2 percent of GDP).
25. Oil windfall earnings in 2011 will largely be saved. The 2011 budget oil price
assumption of $70/bbl for 2011 has been increased to $100/bbl, in line with global trends;
this generates a revenue windfall of 1.3 percent of GDP. Consistent with the new Petroleum
Revenue Management Bill adopted by Parliament in March 2011, this windfall will largely
be saved.6
26. Tax administration is also being reinforced (MEFP, ¶21–23). Tax exemptions were
streamlined in the 2011 budget,7 customs procedures have been tightened in the wake of
reported governance abuses at the port, and a task force has been established to tackle weak
tax filing by the self-employed. The 2011 fiscal framework projects that improved tax
administration and streamlined exemptions will raise collections by 0.8 percent of GDP in
2011; the authorities are confident that they can exceed this goal. Direct tax collections have
risen steadily relative to GDP in recent years, partly reflecting initial computerization, and
further gains are projected for 2011 and beyond. Strong growth in customs collections
boosted overall tax receipts through March 2011 (para. 21).
27. Consistent with the government’s strategy, staff urged faster progress in
modernizing the Ghana Revenue Authority (GRA). The authorities noted that the
pending deputy commissioner appointments were provisionally assigned in March 2011
(June 2010 benchmark) and had been forwarded for public service ratification (MEFP, ¶20).
Establishment of criteria for corporate coverage by the Large Taxpayer Unit (LTU)
(June 2010 benchmark) will be completed following the relocation of the LTU in May 2011
(MEFP, ¶22).

6

The bill approved by parliament is not yet available; it is being redrafted to include amendments, ahead of
presidential signature and publication.
7

The budget repealed the power of the Ghana Investment Promotion Council (GIPC) to extend tax exemptions
and took steps to streamline tax exemptions for real estate developers.

20
D. Steps to Manage Public Spending
The government is reinforcing expenditure controls to support fiscal consolidation and
avoid further domestic arrears.
Expenditure management systems
28. Spending targets were missed in 2010. Discussions focused on the need to better
manage non-interest spending, which rose 13 percent faster than programmed in 2010,
notably in the area of goods and services and investment programs.8 The government
emphasized that much of this pressure (and the associated arrears) related to spending on
projects that were launched in the final year of the preceding administration. Moreover,
while underlining their determination to reinforce spending discipline, the government noted
the widespread view that public spending had helped Ghana weather and subsequently
recover from the global financial crisis. Staff noted the importance of a clear message that
fiscal stimulus cannot deliver sustained improvements in growth and living standards.
29. The government sought Fund advice on institutional reforms to ensure effective
spending restraint. A February 2011 TA mission identified systemic weaknesses in
spending controls dating back to the mid-1990s, including weak PFM systems and
processes, ineffective warrant and release mechanisms, and patchy compliance with
commitment controls. The authorities indicated their resolve to adopt the key
recommendations of this mission.
30. The government has already taken steps to better control spending discipline.
After spending pressures were identified as a continuing obstacle to fiscal consolidation in
the administration’s second year, the president issued in October 2010 a directive to
spending units to strictly comply with Ghana’s commitment control regime; this was
reiterated in the January 2011 budget instructions (MEFP ¶30). The authorities report that
this is having an important impact on spending levels. Cash domestic and foreign financed
capital spending was up 8 percent on a year earlier in the first quarter of 2011, compared to
budgeted spending growth of 11 percent for the full year. The effectiveness of spending
discipline will be more clearly established with the first quarterly report on arrears for
June 2011 (MEFP ¶34), where the authorities aim at no new arrears, in contrast to the
accumulation of arrears to contractors of 1.8 percent of GDP in 2010.
31. Consistent with the February 2011 TA recommendations, the planning and
monitoring of spending is being strengthened. This involves developing more strategic
and realistic expenditure budgets, and reinstating quarterly ceilings for managing spending,
8

Measured including expenditure arrears, but excluding higher than programmed foreign financed capital
investments.

21
and warrant and expenditure control mechanisms for adoption within Ghana’s Integrated
Financial Management Information System (GIFMIS) (MEFP ¶26–28). The GIFMIS roll
out to 14 pilot ministries (March 2011 benchmark) was not possible due to financial and
technical issues; instead, the system will be rolled out comprehensively to all spending units
from January 2012 (MEFP ¶27).
Managing the public wage bill
32. Ghana’s public wage bill has been a source of expenditure pressure. Between
2007 and 2010, the wage bill rose from 6 to more than 7 percent of GDP, a level higher than
in many peer countries. A further rise in the wage bill to 7½ percent of GDP is projected for
2011, as a result of the new “single spine” pay structure. The precise cost of the new pay
regime will depend on a service-by-service pay mapping exercise. To prevent any budget
overruns, the migration to the new system will be phased to fit within the pay envelope
(MEFP, ¶38–40). To ease budget planning, staff urged that public sector pay negotiations be
conducted before the start of the budget year, rather than mid-year, as at present.
33. Better staffing oversight is needed.9 The ongoing migration of public agencies to a
central payroll database is beginning to provide better oversight of outlays. Comprehensive
migration has been delayed by some groups seeking to protect contested allowances, but
with renewed high level support the migration is targeted for completion by mid-2011
(MEFP, ¶39). Control of the pension payroll will be strengthened through the introduction
of biometric identification technology, to be extended later to the wage payroll subsequent
to the audits conducted on the Health and Education Services (MEFP, ¶40). Subvented
agencies to be commercialized or liquidated have been identified with independent
consultant support, with the list submitted to Cabinet for decision in March 2011 (delayed
from the December 2010 benchmark).
Other spending rigidities
34. A large part of revenues is allocated inflexibly. In 2010, about 20 percent of tax
revenues accrued to statutory funds based on mandatory revenue-sharing rules, while
departments retained internally-generated funds for their own use equivalent to a further
11 percent of tax revenues. These procedures can result in resource misallocations. The
government took an initial step toward greater flexibility by agreeing with the statutory
funds that, starting in 2011, 30 percent of their earmarked revenues would finance social
programs that would otherwise have required funding from the budget. Staff recommended
that internally generated funds be transferred to the consolidated fund, and departmental
operations be financed instead with appropriated resources.
9

World Bank analysis suggests that the large real wage increases in recent years were a response to earlier
under-compensation, and that the priority is to tackle the size of Ghana’s public sector workforce.

22
E. Tighter Control Over Expenditure Arrears and Debt
Arrears and debt need to move center-stage as key issues of fiscal management.
Arrears management
35. Staff urged stepped-up efforts toward regularizing expenditure arrears. Progress
has been hampered by a lack of comprehensive data on arrears and clear responsibilities for
arrears monitoring and policies within the Ministry of Finance. Following TA advice,
responsibility for monitoring the arrears position is being better defined, and a stocktaking
exercise and audits (where necessary) will be conducted. This will provide the required
information to design later in 2011 a comprehensive strategy for regularizing arrears using a
mix of bonds and cash (MEFP ¶36). With a number of priority projects jeopardized by
nonpayment, cash payments to settle arrears equivalent to 1.1 percent of GDP were made in
early 2011, while a second tranche of public bonds amounting to 1.1 percent of GDP was
issued to clear TOR’s debts to the Ghana Commercial Bank (GCB).10
Debt management
36. Good progress has been achieved in deepening debt management skills and
policies in 2010. Both 2010 structural benchmarks were met, and commercial borrowing
has been tightly managed, with a large loan renegotiated before signature when updated
calculations showed that it fell short of the required grant element. Further advances in debt
management are planned for the year ahead, including through issuing a second annual debt
management strategy (MEFP ¶49).
37. The updated debt sustainability assessment (DSA) shows lower risks of debt
distress than in the scenarios developed a year ago. External debt indicators are projected
to remain well below relevant thresholds, even under adverse shock scenarios (Debt
Sustainability Analysis, Supplement 1).11 This outcome reflects the upward revision to GDP
(which affects debt- and debt service to GDP ratios) and lower projections for commercial
financing, consistent with the recent cautious pace of such borrowing. The favorable DSA
depends critically on sustained fiscal consolidation and continuing robust economic growth.
38. Rising rollover risks should be monitored closely. Fiscal financing was eased in
2010 by resumed nonresident purchases of 3-year treasury bonds, in an amount equivalent
to nearly 2½ percent of GDP. As a result, the share of domestic debt held by nonresidents
rose to 19 percent at end-2010, up from 8 percent a year earlier. Continued reliance on
financing at this level carries risks, and consistent with goals to reduce reliance on such
10

Debt service on these bonds is covered by a levy on petroleum products.

11

See IMF Country Report No. 10/178, Appendix II.

23
short-term external funding, the adjustment program is designed to be sustainable with
nonresident inflows at half this level or less (Table 2B). This would be broadly offset by
increased commercial borrowing, albeit at generally longer maturities. Based on Ghana’s
improved debt management performance and the more favorable DSA, the program
provides for an increase in the untied commercial borrowing ceiling for projects outside the
oil and gas sectors from $300 million in 2010 to $500 million annually for 2011–12
(MEFP ¶52).
F. Energy Sector Issues
Progress in adjusting energy prices to market conditions should continue.
39. The cost-recovery power tariffs established in 2010 are being protected by
quarterly tariff reviews. In the first review, effective March 2011, the regulatory
commission authorized a 17 percent average tariff reduction based on cheaper natural gas
imports from Nigeria and stepped up hydro production. Staff noted the importance of
keeping costs closely under review, and being ready to raise tariffs, as needed.
40. Petroleum pump prices were raised 30 percent in January 2011 to cost recovery
levels after a rise in global prices in late-2010. Hedging operations conducted since
October 2010 have provided protection from global price increases since January. With the
benefits of hedging, pump prices can be maintained at current levels through mid-2011. If
global prices remain at current levels, a pump price increase of 15 percent or more would be
required at that time. The government is determined to ensure that petroleum pricing does
not result in a new fiscal burden, and the need for pricing adjustments will be revisited
ahead of the next review (MEFP ¶45). Staff recommended smaller and more frequent
petroleum pricing adjustments, to avoid large adjustment shocks.
41. The bulk of TOR’s bank liabilities were cleared through public debt issues
(paragraph 35). As a result, it has regained operational independence.12 Plans to modernize
the refinery and strengthen its longer-term commercial viability have been developed and
will be shared with the World Bank for its assessment (MEFP ¶46).
G. Monetary, Exchange Rate and Financial Policies
Upside inflation risks will require close attention, and actions to address banking sector
vulnerability need to continue.

12

TOR’s financial viability will depend on its future investment needs, and how these would be financed. This
will be addressed in the modernization plan.

24
Monetary and exchange rate policy
42. Discussions focused on how to manage the monetary implications of Ghana’s
strong balance of payments. Although inflationary pressures from rising petroleum prices
and strong domestic growth have been offset, so far, by the beneficial impact of broad
currency stability, risks are on the upside. Strong capital inflows could also pose a challenge
for liquidity and exchange rate management, with implications for price stability. The BoG
indicated that policies would continue to aim at keeping inflation within a narrow band
around the target rate. Staff recommended that the BoG stand ready to tighten policies, if
needed, to counter emerging pricing pressures.
43. The authorities remain committed to exchange rate flexibility in support of their
inflation targeting regime. In practice, the BoG has taken advantage of balance of
payments surpluses to strengthen reserve cover, while maintaining broad currency stability
against the dollar. Staff supported the buildup of Ghana’s reserve cover, which remains
modest, particularly in light of growing portfolio capital flows. The authorities were alert to
the liquidity consequences of the projected reserve accumulation, and arrangements to share
the cost of sterilization operations with the budget have been developed. Staff recommended
that the BoG’s systems and tools for exchange market monitoring and intervention be
further developed, to reflect the BoG’s evolving role at the center of the currency market as
portfolio and other capital flows increase. The BoG intends to request TA in these areas.
44. The staff’s analysis suggests that the valuation of Ghana’s currency is broadly in
line with fundamentals (Appendix I). This is consistent with the continuing strong growth
of non-traditional exports (albeit from a low base). The authorities indicated their
commitment to a floating exchange rate policy supportive of the inflation targeting regime.
They concurred that currency valuation is not a pressing issue, while underlining the need to
keep competitiveness under close review, given tensions between Ghana’s recent broad
currency stability and its inflation premium over trading partners. Non-price factors were
identified as a core challenge for competitiveness. Ghana’s business climate out-performs
many regional commodity exporting peers, but is not competitive with more successful
manufacturing exporters like South Africa.
Financial Sector Issues
45. The FSAP update and Article IV consultation missions discussed weaknesses in
credit intermediation by Ghanaian banks. Banks’ interest rate spreads are wide (as much
as 20 percentage points between deposit and lending rates), reflecting high overhead and
staffing costs and the current burden of high NPLs. The expansion from 16 to 26 banks
between 2000 and 2010 has bid up funding costs rather than reducing loan rates. There are
wide variances in credit terms between high and low-tier borrowers, owing to differences in
the pricing of credit risk and intense competition for top tier borrowers. Reforms to
strengthen institutional and legislative frameworks for insolvency and creditor protection

25
have been implemented in recent years, including the establishment of a credit reference
bureau, but these reforms need to take hold. Due to a weak legal framework and
enforcement, banks’ accounting practices do not comply with best international standards.
Majority state ownership in some banks has also contributed to weak risk management
practices, as well as overexposure to certain sectors and borrowers.13 The authorities see
prospects for improved industry performance, as higher minimum capital requirements
encourage consolidation.
46. The BoG is addressing banking sector vulnerabilities drawing on the
recommendations of the 2010 FSAP Update mission. The BoG is strengthening banking
supervision, including through coordination on cross-border supervision of banks with other
regional central banks, and is taking steps to promote stronger risk management practices in
the industry and addressing corporate governance in state banks. A strategy for weak banks
is being developed, which would comprise audits of some of the banks to establish their true
financial position. The BoG is reviewing the banking laws to enhance its ability to address
troubled institutions, and plans to relinquish its ownership interest in two domestic banks
where there is a potential conflict of interest with its role as supervisor (MEFP ¶56).14
47. An unresolved issue is the role of the social security trust (SSNIT) within the
financial system. Being a majority shareholder in several banks and a large depositor with
others conflicts with its role as a manager of pensions and distorts the operations of the
financial system. The authorities recognized the importance of the issue and intend to
explore options for an exit strategy for SSNIT as a majority shareholder in financial
institutions.
48. The BoG is strengthening its AML/CFT supervisory framework and capacity.
The recent IMF technical assistance mission identified several areas where further progress
is needed, in particular related to the capacity of the Banking Supervision Department and
the recently established Anti-money Laundering Office.
IV. PROGRAM DESIGN AND FINANCING
A. Program Design
49. Quantitative targets through end-June 2012 are presented in Appendix Table 2 of
the MEFP. Given the priority of expanding Ghana’s tax base, the program includes a new
indicative target for non-oil tax revenue collections. Reflecting Ghana’s more open capital
account and financial market integration, and its strengthened debt management capacity, a
13

The state has a controlling interest in five banks accounting for 30 percent of the banking system assets. See
the Financial System Stability Assessment (FSSA) report for further details.

14

In the interim, these banks have been placed in an independent trust.

26
change from residency to currency criterion (where any borrowing denominated in foreign
currency is considered external) has been introduced to better monitor borrowing in foreign
currencies under the program (TMU ¶27).
50. Structural benchmarks through June 2012 focus on strengthening revenue
administration, reinforcing the management of public expenditures, arrears, and debt,
establishing pay comparability data, pricing of energy products, and addressing banking
sector vulnerability (MEFP; Appendix Table 3).
B. Program Financing
51. Financing for the 2011 adjustment program includes $215 million of World
Bank support. The World Bank credit was approved in January 2011, informed by an IMF
assessment letter. While the government continues to seek concessional resources to
accelerate its arrears repayments, the program does not give rise to any fiscal financing gap
beyond the disbursed World Bank resources and other funding already included in the fiscal
baseline.
52. Balance of payments financing of about $187 million is provided by the ECF
arrangement in 2011, with a further $186 million in 2012. A proposed change to the
phasing of ECF disbursements would back-load resources from the third and fourth reviews
to the remaining program period, consistent with Ghana’s stronger-than-programmed
external performance and revised policy commitments.15
V. STAFF APPRAISAL
53. Although some important gains were achieved in 2010, a valuable opportunity
for fiscal adjustment was missed. Ghana experienced an unusually favorable external
environment, including strong terms of trade, good rainfalls, and a recovery of nonresident
demand for domestic bonds. This underpinned important achievements: rising growth,
increased reserve cover, a currency that held its value, and lower inflation. But a failure to
maintain the momentum of fiscal adjustment was a significant setback under the program.
Although electricity tariffs were substantially increased to eliminate subsidy burdens and tax
revenues met budget goals, the budget proved to be over-reliant on non-tax revenues and the
government did not adequately rein in spending pressures. Weak institutions and
insufficiently robust policy implementation both played a role.
54. More robust fiscal management is needed in 2011. The environment remains
supportive, reinforced by the launch of oil production at very favorable prices. This provides
15

Gross reserve cover at end-2010 was $4.7 billion (3.2 months of import cover), compared to a programmed
$3.7 billion (2.9 months of import cover).

27
a window of opportunity to strengthen non-oil tax collections and expenditure control. A
welcome start was made by adjusting petroleum pump prices to avoid new subsidy burdens,
and by deciding to save a large part of Ghana’s initial oil incomes. Continued decisive
implementation of the fiscal program will be needed to restore budget space over the
medium term to fund development programs and infrastructure modernization.
55. Structural reforms should be accelerated. Fiscal imbalances reflect, in part,
institutional weaknesses: inefficient and leaky tax administration; opaque payroll
management; an overly large public service; and patchy compliance with commitment
controls by spending ministries. Good progress has been made in strengthening debt
management practices, and it will be important to move forward more robustly with other
elements of the reform agenda.
56. Clear and transparent management of oil revenues is a priority. With the
petroleum revenue management bill only recently approved by parliament, procedures are
still being refined for how to treat oil-related operations in the fiscal accounts and BoG
balance sheets. It will be important that incomes, expenditures, and savings associated with
oil wealth be transparently and comprehensively recorded for dissemination, analysis, and
audit purposes.
57. Energy pricing remains an area of risk. With public institutions playing an
important role in power production and sourcing petroleum products, pressures to limit
pricing pass-through remain strong. The adoption of quarterly power tariff reviews is
welcome. For petroleum products, more frequent, smaller pricing adjustments in line with
market trends would help depoliticize the pricing process.
58. Monetary policy implementation will need to remain vigilant. Rising global
commodity prices and strong domestic liquidity expansion present upside risks to inflation,
and the BoG should stand ready to tighten policies in support of the inflation target, if
needed.
59. Ghana’s flexible exchange rate policy remains appropriate, and the currency’s
valuation is estimated to be broadly in line with fundamentals. Sterilized intervention
has helped limit the liquidity impact of the strong balance of payments, and the associated
reserve buildup provides a cushion to manage the potential risks from portfolio financing
flows. The BoG is encouraged to give a high priority to developing its capacity to monitor
balance of payments developments and its policies and tools for currency market
intervention.
60. The authorities have made good progress in reducing immediate stability risks
in the banking sector, but long term financial stability will require a sustained and
comprehensive reform effort. Priority should be given to updating Ghana’s financial
sector strategy and to reviewing the current extent of state involvement in the banking
industry. A concerted effort is needed to resolve vulnerable institutions, strengthen risk

28
management in banks, enhance supervisory capacity and enforcement of prudential
regulations, as well as strengthen corporate governance, accounting standards, and creditor
rights.
61. Based on Ghana’s performance and the strength of the program for 2011–12,
staff recommends completion of the third and fourth reviews under the ECF
arrangement. Given steps to strengthen fiscal performance drawing on the lessons from
2010, including new fiscal measures for 2011, reforms to tax administration and expenditure
and arrears management, staff supports the requested waiver on the nonobservance of the
performance criteria on the net change in domestic arrears and on the overall fiscal balance
at end-December 2010. At the same time, there are substantial risks under the program and,
to mitigate these risks, the authorities will need to implement the program with much greater
determination than in the past.
62. Staff proposes that the next Article IV consultation take place within 24 months,
in accordance with the decision on consultation cycles in program countries.

APPENDIX I. GHANA: EXCHANGE RATE ASSESSMENT
AND NON-PRICE COMPETITIVENESS
1.
This note is an updated assessment of Ghana’s currency valuation and non-price
competitiveness. The exchange rate of the Ghanaian cedi was broadly in line with the
country’s macroeconomic fundamentals in 2010, an assessment shared by the authorities.
Broader measures of business competitiveness based on Ghana’s business climate point to
the importance of strengthening macroeconomic management and addressing infrastructure
bottlenecks.
I. Exchange Rate Assessment
A. Developments since the 2009 Article IV Assessment
2.
Two years ago, the 2009 Article IV report pointed to “signs of possible modest
overvaluation”. This guarded assessment of the cedi’s value reflected divergent analytical
results: the macroeconomic balance (MB) and external sustainability (ES) approaches
pointed to an overvaluation in the 7–12 percent range, whereas the equilibrium real effective
exchange rate (EREER) approach, based on econometric estimates that were unstable and
potentially unreliable, suggested an undervaluation of 30–40 percent.
3.
The real exchange rate is back at 2009 levels. The real effective exchange rate
depreciated by some 8 percent in 2009, subsequently appreciating in 2010, returning to close
to the level examined in the 2009 Article IV (see Appendix Figure A.1). The real
appreciation during 2010 has been driven by a combination of higher inflation than in partner
countries and broad stability in the nominal effective exchange rate.
B. Approaches used for the 2011 Currency Analysis
Current account-based measures
4.
The macroeconomic balance and external sustainability estimates have been
updated. As in the 2009 Article IV, the MB and ES approaches point to a modest
overvaluation, though the scale is smaller on current data (about 2–5 percent). The current
account norm using the MB approach is estimated at a deficit of 3 percent of GDP, while the
computed NFA-stabilizing current account deficit under the ES approach is calculated at
2 percent of GDP. As the underlying current account deficit is projected at around 6 percent
of GDP, this implies the need for a modest depreciation to close the gap. The estimated
overvaluation is slightly smaller than in the 2009 exercise due to a stronger medium-term

38
current account deficit than earlier projected, and due to a stronger real exchange rate
elasticity of the trade balance than in the 2009 exercise.1
Econometric approaches
5.
An alternative econometric approach was considered for this exercise. Efforts to
develop econometric results that are statistically stable and convincing using the EREER
approach have not been successful. As an alternative, the Capital-Enhanced Equilibrium
Exchange Rate (CHEER) approach was explored. The CHEER approach is grounded on the
idea that current account imbalances must be financed through the capital account (see
Juselius (1995); Juselius and McDonald (2004)). It nests the Purchasing Power Parity (PPP)
theory (long run equilibrium in the goods market), and the Uncovered Interest parity (UIP)
condition (short run equilibrium in the financial market).
6.
The CHEER approach seems appropriate in the case of Ghana for three
reasons: (i) Ghana has witnessed considerable capital inflows over the past few years (see
Appendix Figure A.2), reflecting an increasingly open capital account; (ii) the CHEER
approach is convenient where country circumstances and policies are changing rapidly, as the
use of high frequency data allows estimates to be developed with relatively short data sets;2
and most importantly (iii) the approach seems to be supported by data, as departures from
PPP in Ghana tend to be correlated with real interest rate differentials (see
Appendix Figure A.3).
7.
The CHEER specification is estimated by applying a Vector Error Correction
(VEC) model to monthly data from January 1995 to December 2010. Using the Johansen
cointegration method, we find a significant and asymmetric influence of domestic and
foreign prices on the cedi exchange rate, with the latter playing a stronger role. The exchange
rate is also significantly influenced by foreign interest rates, which represent the return on
investing abroad; a lower foreign interest rate tends to strengthen the cedi.

1

The 2009 assessment used a trade elasticity of -0.23 from the CGER whereas this note uses Ghana-specific
estimate of -0.68 from Tokarick (2010).

2

In fact the standard equilibrium approach might have failed to be conclusive because Ghana went through
several structural changes over the past few decades that estimations of the standard equilibrium method usually
cover.

39
8.
The CHEER method suggests an overvaluation of less than 5 percent in 2010
(see Appendix Figure A.4). This result points to the same direction as the MB and ES
estimates. It suggests that the cedi was slightly more appreciated in 2010 than would have
been expected given interest rate differentials and inflation trends.3 Restricting estimations to
historical data up to 2009, the CHEER approach suggests that the cedi was undervalued by
some 12 percent in 2008. This is in the same direction, but significantly smaller in magnitude
than the standard equilibrium exchange rate approach which was used in the 2009 Article IV
report.
Conclusions
9.
Given the analytical margin of uncertainty, the cedi is assessed to be broadly
appropriately valued in 2010. More weight is given (as in the 2009 assessment) to the
results from the MB and ES approaches. The small size of the estimated overvaluation on
these approaches (2–5 percent) is within the range typically seen as consistent with economic
fundamentals. This conclusion was shared by Ghanaian authorities.
II. Non-Price Competitiveness
10.
Ghana’s favorable economic outlook is attracting new investments. With the start
of oil production and a generally attractive business climate, Ghana is attracting increasing
foreign investment inflows (see Appendix Figure A.2). These developments, while welcome,
risk creating inflationary pressures contributing to Dutch disease effects, in which
appreciation of the real exchange rate leaves domestic producers uncompetitive. Risks of this
nature to competitiveness can be addressed by structural reforms that seek to strengthen the
business climate.
Survey-based competitiveness assessments
11.
Ghana compares well to “factor-driven economies”. According to the Global
Competitiveness Report (GCR) 2010–11, Ghana matches or out-performs the average
“factor-driven economies” on a range of measures, including education, training, labor
markets, and infrastructure. The main shortcoming is in terms of its macroeconomic

3

The extent of overvaluation is larger when the domestic interest rate is included among the regressors. This is
because the Ghanaian T-bill rate has a depreciating impact on the equilibrium exchange rate. There are two
potential reasons behind this puzzling result: (i) we use 90 days T-bill rates instead of 3–5 years bond rates—
due to data availability—which is likely to distort the UIP condition as foreign investors are not allowed to
invest in Ghanaian T-bills, but in bonds of 3-years maturity and beyond; (ii) the coefficient on the domestic Tbill rate may be capturing the Ghanaian risk premium which is missing in the model’s specification. The
CHEER approach appears promising and will be explored further, particularly as a longer time series on
Ghana’s sovereign bond yields provides more data on trends in Ghana’s risk premium.

40
environment. This comparison is not very demanding, however, since the GCR sees factordriven economies as in the first of three stages of economic development.
12.
Ghana’s performance is more mixed by the standards of “efficiency-driven
economies”. These countries are viewed by the GCR as in the second stage of economic
development. Following Ghana’s reclassification as a lower-middle income country, this peer
group, which includes Namibia, Mauritius, and South-Africa, appears relevant. Ghana
matches the peer group average in terms of market efficiency and size, higher education and
training, financial development, and technology readiness, but lags behind in the supply of
infrastructure, institutional quality, and, again, macroeconomic management.
13.
A further perspective is provided by the World Bank’s Doing Business report. In
a comparison with South Africa (appropriately relatively ambitious peer comparison), Ghana
lags in seven out of ten categories (Appendix Figure A.6). Areas in which Ghana lags by
large margins include relatively burdensome procedures for starting and shutting down
businesses, obtaining construction permits, and filing taxes; access to credit is also more
limited. On a positive note, Ghana is cited in Doing Business 2010–11 as the country most
improved in terms of access to credit during 2009–10.
Conclusions
14.
Macroeconomic management, access to financing, and infrastructure quality are
seen as leading impediments to business in Ghana. To some extent, these factors are interrelated. For example, stronger macroeconomic policies that address the problem of
expenditure arrears and SOE debts will help reduce non-performing loans in the banking
industry and improve access to and the cost of credit. Stronger public expenditure
management can also play an important role in better prioritizing infrastructure projects and
achieving value for money in these investments. These areas, rather than currency valuation,
appear to be the most productive approaches to boosting Ghana’s international
competitiveness.

APPENDIX II—LETTER OF INTENT
May 12, 2011
Mr. Dominique Strauss-Kahn
Managing Director
International Monetary Fund
Washington, DC 20431
Dear Mr. Strauss-Kahn:
After a temporary slowdown, buoyant exports and increased construction and service sector
activities have helped the economy to recover. Growth is estimated at 6.6 percent this year,
up from 4.7 percent in 2009. Fiscal and monetary policy tightening and currency stability
have eased inflationary pressures and inflation has remained in single digit level since mid2010. Medium-term prospects look promising and will be boosted by rising oil production.
Despite good progress in stabilizing the economy, policy implementation faced important
challenges. In particular, adjustments to electricity and fuel tariffs to cost-recovery levels
were implemented despite strong public resistance. Furthermore, the conflicts in Côte
d’Ivoire and Libya are impacting the economy as people have sought refuge in Ghana and
more than 16 thousand Ghanaian migrant workers have been evacuated from Libya.
Consequently, we anticipate a reduction in Ghana’s remittance earnings, an important source
of foreign exchange, and an increased burden on public service deliveries.
The attached Memorandum of Economic and Financial Policies (MEFP) reports on Ghana’s
recent economic developments and implementation of Ghana’s economic program under the
three-year Extended Credit Facility (ECF), which was approved by the IMF Executive Board
on July 15, 2009.
All quantitative performance criteria for end-June 2010 and end-December 2010 were met
except those for the net change in the stock of domestic arrears and the overall deficit of the
government (missed in end-December). The fiscal deficit target at end-December 2010 was
only narrowly missed, and the shortfall would have been just 0.1 percent of GDP if a
measure involving the sale of gold company shares received in lieu of royalties had been
completed in December 2010, rather than slipping to January 2011. The government views
the accumulation of domestic arrears as the central challenge to its fiscal adjustment
program. To address the issue, it is improving the monitoring of arrears and conducting a
stock-taking exercise to determine the actual size of outstanding arrears. With a number of
priority projects being jeopardized by non-payment, the government has settled arrears
totaling 2½ percent of GDP in 2010 and further arrears of a similar magnitude in relation to
GDP in the first quarter of 2011.

44
Progress in implementing the program’s structural benchmarks was mixed. Debt
management policies and performance was strengthened, which contributed to meeting the
performance criterion on external borrowing. However, the implementation of several
benchmarks was delayed and the government gives importance to implementing them as
soon as possible. The ongoing modernization of Ghana’s revenue administration that started
in 2009 has improved tax collections. Expenditure management is being strengthened with
support from Ghana’s development partners and efforts are underway to better monitor the
public sector wage bill and pension payments.
These and other components of the government’s economic stabilization and reform program
are described in the MEFP. Based on these policies, the government requests that the IMF’s
Executive Board grant a waiver for the missed performance criteria on the overall fiscal
deficit of the government and on the net change in the stock of domestic arrears for endDecember 2010. The government also requests approval of proposed new structural
benchmarks for the period through June 2012 and adjustments to June 2011 performance
criteria and the establishment of performance criteria through March 2012.
In support of its policies, the government requests that the IMF’s Executive Board complete
the third and fourth reviews of Ghana’s ECF arrangement and approve disbursement of the
fourth and fifth tranches of the loan, based on proposed rephasing of disbursements as set
forth in the attached schedule to the MEFP. The fifth review is expected to be completed
before end-December 2011, and the sixth and seventh reviews are expected to be completed
by end-April and end-June, 2012, respectively.
The Government of Ghana will provide such information as the Fund may request in
connection with progress in implementing its economic and financial policies. The
government believes that the policies set out in this letter are adequate to achieve the
objectives of its program, but it will take any further measures that may become appropriate
for this purpose. The Government will consult with the Fund on the adoption of these
measures, and in advance of revisions to the policies contained in the MEFP, in accordance
with the Fund’s policies on such consultations. We have no objection to publication of the
staff report for the third and fourth reviews under the ECF arrangement, this letter of intent,
and the attached memorandum of economic and financial policies and technical
memorandum of understanding.

APPENDIX II—ATTACHMENT I
MEMORANDUM OF ECONOMIC AND FINANCIAL POLICIES, 2011–13
I. RECENT DEVELOPMENTS AND 2010 PROGRAM PERFORMANCE1
A. Growth and Inflation in 2010
1.
The economy is recovering from a temporary slowdown in 2009. After growth of
4.7 percent in 2009, the Government Statistical Service is projecting a 6.6 percent expansion
in 2010, underpinned by buoyant commodity exports, construction, and services. Business
and consumer confidence have improved with greater macroeconomic stability in Ghana, the
global recovery, and Ghana’s transition to oil producer status.
2.
Rebased national accounts show Ghana as richer and growing faster than earlier
perceived. In the rebased accounts, income levels and income per capita are almost
70 percent higher than earlier estimates, lifting Ghana into lower-middle income status. The
latest growth estimates for 2007–09 are also about 1 percent higher than earlier estimates.
Recent growth has been particularly rapid in the service sector, which now accounts for close
to half of the overall economy.
3.
Inflation rates have declined. Annual consumer price inflation has been in single
digits since mid-2010, with a year-on-year outturn of 8.6 percent in December 2010, down
from 16.0 percent a year earlier. The slower pace of inflation reflects earlier monetary policy
tightening, broad exchange rate stability, and favorable crop yields. Inflation is currently at
the middle of the inflation target range.
B. Fiscal Performance Through end-2010
4.
The fiscal deficit target was only narrowly missed in 2010. While revenue
collections were broadly as programmed, grant receipts fell short and spending overruns
were recorded, notably for recurrent goods and services where the program allocation was
very tight. The fiscal deficit (cash basis, measured from financing side) was 6.7 percent of
GDP in 2010, compared to 5.6 percent of GDP in 2009, and an adjusted 2010 program target
of 5.9 percent of GDP. The government adopted corrective actions as deficit pressures
emerged in 2010 to bring the deficit back on track, but the sale of gold company shares
received by the government in lieu of royalties slipped into the early days of January 2011,
rather than being finalized in 2010, as planned. If this revenue (equivalent to 0.7 percent of
1

2010 program performance is summarized in Appendix Table 1.

46
GDP) had been collected in 2010, the slippage relative to the program target would have
been less than 0.2 percent of GDP.
5.
Fiscal pressures continued in respect of domestic arrears. Arrears were
accumulated in 2010 to contractors for investment projects, where spending ran above
appropriated levels, and to statutory funds, where fiscal resources were not adequate to make
earmarked revenue transfers. As a result, while the program had sought a net reduction in
arrears equivalent to 0.2 percent of GDP in 2010, arrears increased, in net terms, by
1.9 percent of GDP. A review of these arrears indicates that the large majority relate to a
surge in spending commitments in 2007–08 for projects which are now being completed and
invoices submitted. The combined fiscal slippage, taking into account both cash transactions
(the cash deficit) and unpaid bills (arrears), was equivalent to 2.6 percent of GDP, and would
have been less than 2 percent of GDP, had the additional revenue measure noted above been
completed in 2010, as planned.
6.
The domestic financing ceiling was narrowly missed due to delays in revenue
and loan financing. Although foreign credits performed well, net domestic financing of the
cash deficit was 0.8 percent of GDP higher than the adjusted program target for end-2010. A
substantial portion of this financing was raised by selling Treasury bonds to nonresident
investors, which ensured that financing from the domestic banking system was kept below
programmed levels. Had the additional revenue effort been completed in 2010, the slippage
relative to the adjusted domestic financing ceiling would have been less than 0.2 percent of
GDP. Moreover, a World Bank loan disbursement of $215 million had been long-planned for
2010, but was approved only in January 2011. If the Bank financing had been on the original
timetable, the NDF targets would have been met. Although public debt rose to an estimated
41½ percent of GDP at end-2010, nonconcessional external borrowing was managed tightly,
and remained within program limits.
C. Monetary and Financial Sector Developments
7.
Falling inflation allowed an easing of monetary policy in 2010. The Bank of
Ghana (BoG) has held its policy rate at 13½ percent since July 2010, down from a peak of
18½ percent in mid-2009. Market interest rates responded more than one-to-one to the BoG
easing, with interbank rates at end-2010 reduced by 11 percentage points from their 2009
peak, and Treasury bill rates down by 13–16 percentage points on the same basis. Bank
lending rates have adjusted by less, remaining well above 25 percent, reflecting a historic
pattern of slow adjustment to policy rates as well as the adverse impact of high nonperforming loans.
8.
Liquidity conditions also reflect strong reserve accumulation. With a large rise in
net international reserves (exceeding program targets), the BoG’s net foreign asset position
boosted reserve money growth by 45 percent during 2010; broad money growth was equally

47
strong. After sluggish private sector credit growth in the first half of 2010 (with declines in
real terms), the pace of lending recovered briskly toward year-end.
9.
While nonperforming loans declined by year-end, some banks are still burdened
by them. Banks remain profitable on average, and the industry is generally well capitalized
(due, in part, to higher minimum statutory capital requirements). Nonperforming loans were
high at 17.6 percent in December 2010, but fell from a peak of 20.0 percent in February.
D. External Sector
10.
External performance was strong in 2010. Exports rose by $2 billion in 2010, with
cocoa and gold exports benefiting from high global commodity prices. This broadly offset a
strong recovery in imports after a decline in 2009, leaving the current account deficit broadly
unchanged at 6 percent of GDP. This was more than financed by strong capital inflows,
including foreign direct investments in the oil sector and bond purchases by nonresident
investors. Gross international reserves totaled more than $4.7 billion at end-2010 (3.3 months
of import cover).
11.
Currency stability was maintained through 2010. The cedi traded through the year
at a little under GH¢ 1.45 per dollar, with the real effective exchange rate remaining its range
over recent years.
II. MACROECONOMIC FRAMEWORK
12.
The government’s economic program aims at sustained robust growth. Real
GDP growth is projected to exceed 13 percent in 2011, reflecting the start of oil production.
Beyond 2011, growth would be 6–7 percent or higher, reflecting strong expansion in the nonoil economy and steady rates of oil extraction. The growth forecast assumes that Ghana’s
favorable business climate will be preserved and strengthened, while infrastructure bottlenecks will be addressed through targeted public investments and public-private partnerships.
Steps to address the problem of government arrears will also strengthen bank balance sheets,
contributing to improved credit conditions.
13.
Financial policies will be geared at single-digit inflation. Under the inflation
targeting regime, the target band for inflation is centered on 9 percent at end-2011. A gradual
further reduction is assumed for the medium term.
14.
Fiscal deficits will be reduced to levels that can be prudently financed. The
government’s goal is to reduce the fiscal deficit to levels that can be comfortably financed
without crowding out private sector credit, and with the goal of progressively reducing debtGDP ratios over the medium term.
15.
With better control over the budget deficit and the start of oil production,
current account deficits are projected to narrow over the medium term. Gross reserve

48
cover is projected to rise to 3½ months of import cover at end-2011, supporting Ghana’s
flexible exchange rate regime in the context of an increasing openness to portfolio capital
flows.
III. ACCELERATING FISCAL CONSOLIDATION
16.
The key budget priority for 2011 is to accelerate the fiscal consolidation
program. Policies will be informed by experience in 2010. For 2011, the government is
resolved to limit the fiscal deficit to 5.7 percent of GDP (cash basis, financing measure).
Within this deficit, the government is designing an arrears payment strategy, which would
include cash payments to clear arrears of about 2.5 percent of GDP in 2011, while seeking to
avoid any new arrears accumulation. Revenue measures have been incorporated in the 2011
budget to strengthen fiscal performance in that year. The debt-to-GDP ratio would reach
46 percent of GDP at end-2011, partly due to the issue of Treasury bonds to settle public
enterprise debts to the banking system.
17.
In 2012–13, continued fiscal consolidation would reduce the fiscal deficit to
2½-3 percent of GDP. This further fiscal adjustment will be driven by rising oil revenues,
strengthened revenue administration, and tight expenditure control. Deficits in this range
would allow a steady, albeit gradual reduction in the debt-GDP ratio.
18.

As discussed below, the government’s fiscal strategy has three pillars:



Strengthened revenue mobilization;



Reinforced expenditure control; and



A program to regularize arrears and other unmet claims.
A. Strengthened Revenue Mobilization

Background
19.
Ghana’s tax revenue base needs to expand. When the government’s adjustment
program was launched in mid-2009, tax revenues were estimated as equivalent to 20 percent
of GDP. Under the rebased and revised national accounts, Ghana’s tax yield is now
calculated as 13-14 percent of GDP.
20.
This elevates the priority to be given to strengthening Ghana’s tax performance.
The government’s economic program sought to combine an increase in tax yields from more
efficient revenue administration, new tax measures, and cuts in tax exemptions. Progress is
continuing on each front:


Modernizing revenue administration is continuing. A good start was made in
establishing the integrated Ghana Revenue Administration (GRA) by end-2009,
bringing together the separate customs, VAT, and direct tax services. External

49
support for GRA reforms was put in place by development partners and the World
Bank, while the IMF has provided TA and a resident advisor. After appointing the
GRA’s Commissioner General in March 2010, the process of appointing
commissioners and their deputies by end-June 2010 (structural benchmark) lagged;
all commissioners were appointed by end-December, while deputies were appointed
in early-March 2011 subject to Public Service Commission approval. These delays
unfortunately slowed the broader reform effort. The effectiveness of the Large
Taxpayer Unit (LTU), including filing compliance, remains to be fully established.
The process of developing criteria for coverage of the LTU (June 2010 structural
benchmark) and reassigning companies to the LTU is now expected to be completed
by June 2011. More broadly, further progress is needed in integrating VAT and direct
taxation within the domestic tax department. As a result, tax administration has not
yet fully benefited from the modernization that was envisaged with the launch of the
GRA.


Tax exemptions remain a burden. Despite efforts to tighten procedures for granting
tax exemptions in early-2010, foregone revenues on account of exemptions amounted
to 10.8 percent of indirect tax collections in 2010, little different from the
11.8 percent figure for 2009. Due to the heavy work load on revenue administration
and tax reform, plans for a comprehensive review of the scope of tax exemptions and
discretionary waivers were delayed from September 2009 to September 2010 (revised
structural benchmark). This project was partly achieved through completion of a
consultant report on import tariff exemptions prepared by end-2010. The review of
the status of other exemptions and waivers will be conducted by June 2011 (structural
benchmark).

Policy measures
21.
The pace of tax administration reform will be accelerated. To ensure strong
leadership of the GRA’s reform program, the confirmation of the appointed deputy
commissioners remains a priority. In the year ahead, the focus in GRA will be on effectively
integrating VAT and income taxation in a single domestic tax department, and adopting an
organizational structure based on taxpayer size. Eleven pilot offices in the Greater Accra area
will integrate VAT and direct taxation under single office heads and with common audit
processes; this pilot will be launched by end-2011(structural benchmark). With the roll-out of
the E-Gov computerization process scheduled for 2011-12, these offices will also move to
unified IT systems for VAT and direct tax administration.
22.
As a first step toward its modernization, the large taxpayer unit will be moved to
new premises. The relocation, expected to be completed by end-May 2011, would provide a
more transparent, user-friendly tax environment, and will be followed by an update of the
criteria for corporate coverage by the LTU. In the next phase of reforms, medium- and small
taxpayer offices will be established. Initially, one medium taxpayer office will be established

50
in Accra to assess business processes. The process of self-assessment for tax purposes will be
extended to all medium- and large taxpayers by mid-2012 (structural benchmark).
23.
To focus VAT administration, the turnover threshold for VAT reporting was
increased in the 2011 budget from GH¢ 10,000 to GH¢ 90,000 (from about $6,500 to
$60,000). Over time, this will focus VAT administration on the 3,000 VAT filers (out of
23,000) who account for over 95 percent of VAT collections. As an interim approach, the
20,000 taxpayers excluded from the core VAT regime are now subject to a new VAT regime
with a 3 percent rate (for which refunds cannot be claimed) in addition to a 2 percent income
tax rate. GRA plans to develop by mid-2011 plans for a successor small taxpayer regime
(structural benchmark), to be adopted in the 2012 budget. This will be based on options
identified by a February 2011 Fund TA mission, with taxpayers moving to the income tax
regime, and paying taxes based on imputed profits calculated using 2 or 3 rates applied to
reported turnover.
24.
Given budget pressures, the government intends to boost non-oil tax collections
to GH¢ 7.7 billion in 2011 (14.9 percent of GDP). The government is confident that this
goal (a new indicative target under the program) can be exceeded through the following
components of an intensified focus on revenue mobilization:


Revenue measures in the 2011 budget. Collections will benefit from extension
through 2011 of the temporary national stabilization levy (corporate profit tax) as
well as the extended coverage of the communications service tax;



Extension of VAT to fee-based financial services. As a supplementary budget
measure, the government is seeking early parliamentary approval of an extension of
VAT to the fee-based incomes of banks and other financial institutions. The required
legislation will be submitted to parliament in May 2011 ahead of the completion of
the third and fourth ECF reviews (see Appendix Table 3). Based on projected
implementation by mid-2011, the yield is estimated at GH¢ 53.6 million in 2011, with
a full-year yield of GH¢ 107 million;



Taxation of the self employed. The government has established a task force staffed
from the GRA and Ministry of Finance’s Tax Policy Unit to tackle a long-standing
problem of weak filing compliance by Ghana’s self-employed taxpayers. A unique
desk for the self-employed will be created, and filing compliance will be checked
against professional organizations’ registers of accountants, lawyers, consultants, etc.
Consideration is being given to establishing a list of professionals in ‘good standing”
with regard to tax filing; evidence of good standing would then be required for
participation in government contract work. The presumptive tax levied on lowerincome self-employed (taxi operators, stallholders, etc) is also being reviewed. The
current fiscal yield from taxation of the self-employed is GH¢ 60–70 million, and a

51
more dedicated focus and a revised presumptive tax is projected to yield at least an
additional GH¢ 30 million in 2011;


Streamlined tax exemptions. In the 2011 budget, the government eliminated the
authority of the Ghana Investment Promotion Council (GIPC) to grant tax
exemptions, except with the approval of the Minister of Finance. The budget also
limited tax exemptions for real estate developers to projects which provide affordable
housing in partnership with the Ministry of Water Resources, Works and Housing.
The goal is to reduce tax exemptions from the 2010 figure of 11 percent of tax
collections.



Strengthened revenue administration. Oversight over tax collections at the Tema
port and other key customs locations has been strengthened. This oversight is being
reinforced by the required use of computerized valuation systems and other
automated procedures that limit administrative discretion. The use of bonded
warehouses is also being more closely monitored, following indications that goods
admitted duty free for re-export were being released into the domestic market.
Following initial steps to strengthen oversight and enforcement, tax yields have
already risen sharply. For example, customs collections in the first quarter of 2011
were 65 percent higher than a year earlier. Positive trends are also seen in the area of
direct taxation, through the use of technology to improve PAYE compliance.
B. Reinforced Expenditure Control

Background
25.
Further progress is needed in strengthening public expenditure control.
Notwithstanding the launch of a broad-based Public Financial Management Reform Program
(PUFMARP) in the mid-1990s, recent experience has highlighted the limited extent of the
progress achieved. Weaknesses in procedures for tracking and controlling commitments and
associated spending continue to give rise to overruns in the fiscal deficit and to payments
arrears. Issues that remain to be addressed include the credibility of budget appropriations,
expenditure rigidities, and procedures for within-year expenditure control and cash release.
Partly reflecting these problems, Ghana’s outlays on recurrent goods and services in 2010
were 50 percent higher than budgeted, while the sum of paid and unpaid bills (arrears)
relating to the discretionary domestic investment budget were almost three times higher than
the 2010 budget appropriation.
Status of structural reforms launched in 2009–10
26.
Initial efforts to strengthen public financial management focused on
computerizing Ghana’s budget systems. The former Budget and Public Expenditure
Management System (BPEMS) had effectively stalled after being rolled out to 8 pilot

52
ministries. An implementation strategy for a successor Ghana Integrated Financial
Management Information System (GIFMIS) was developed with IMF technical assistance
based on a review of existing public financial management processes and guided by the
systemic weaknesses identified in the Public Expenditure and Financial Assessment (PEFA)
process. The project is being managed under the Steering Committee chaired by a Deputy
Minister of Finance, and development partner financing has been identified.
27.
The timetable for rolling out GIFMIS to 14 pilot ministries, departments, and
agencies (MDAs) has been updated. The pilot roll out was scheduled to be completed by
March 2011 (structural benchmark), but was delayed pending resolution of conflicts between
planned software and existing hardware, and by delays in securing external funding. The
revised plan is now to pilot the GIFMIS within the CAGD from July 2011, with a roll out to
ministries in January 2012.
28.
In the run up to GIFMIS, parallel efforts have been underway to strengthen
cash management and commitment forecasting and control. Since May 2009, cash
management committee meetings have been held on a weekly basis, involving the Ministry
of Finance, Controller and Accountant General’s Department (CAGD), and BoG. This
intensified monitoring of revenues, cash balances, and expenditures has helped in setting
quarterly expenditure ceilings and monthly cash limits for spending units. The effectiveness
of this cash planning was undermined, however, by weak information about the commitment
pipeline and prospective spending claims. To address this gap, the cash management
committee, using a module in the existing budget preparation software, has been
strengthening data collection on past commitments and contracts for capital expenditure. The
requirement for ministries to obtain commencement certificates was also tightened in
mid-2010 by removing exemptions from the system extended to a few ministries managing
priority programs.
29.
Cash management within the banking system is also being tackled. To address
delays in transferring revenue collections by commercial banks to the government’s accounts
at the BoG, tax and other payments to government are now credited directly to BoG accounts
rather than to commercial banks, except in rural areas. This measure has led to a significant
improvement in government cash flows. Steps are also being taken to better utilize the
government’s cash balances, which extend to 2,500 accounts at the Bank of Ghana with some
further accounts in commercial banks. A number of ministerial, departmental, and agency
accounts at the BoG have been closed, and remaining accounts are now monitored daily by
the BoG to inform the work of the cash management committee. Idle cash balances will be
reallocated to finance expenditures, reducing the need for new domestic debt issuance. Over
time, the Ministry of Finance and CAGD will gain computer access to monitor these
accounts directly.

53
Steps to further enhance expenditure control
30.
Following discussions with staff during the September 2010 mission on emerging
fiscal slippages, the government’s commitment to strict expenditure control was
reinforced at the highest level. A presidential memo was sent in October 2010 to all MDAs
requiring them to seek authorization from the Ministry of Finance and Economic Planning
(MoFEP), through Commencement Certificates, before undertaking any capital spending.
This message was reiterated by MoFEP in its Budget Implementation Instruction in
January 2011. Indications in the opening months of 2011 are that this is having an important
impact on the pace of spending.
31.
The government’s commitment to expenditure control will be supported by
reforms to the budget process. As highlighted in a recent review by IMF experts, stronger
expenditure control requires a range of short and medium-term measures, and spans a
number of topics. Within a broadened program to strengthen PEM, the government intends to
give the following priority:


More strategic and realistic expenditure budgeting. Under past budgets, ministries
submitted unconstrained spending proposals in August, and were required to develop
constrained budgets only in October (one month ahead of the budget’s submission to
parliament). This process provides little incentive or opportunity for ministries to
develop realistic, prioritized spending plans. For the 2012 budget, the Cabinet will
identify program priorities in April/May 2011. These priorities will be communicated
to MDAs with indicative spending ceilings in the July budget preparation guidelines.
This process is identified as a structural benchmark under the program.



Quarterly expenditure ceilings. The adoption of monthly cash limits for MDAs
(above) has helped cash management by MoFEP at the expense of operational
flexibility for MDAs. Given the time required to obtain funds releases (warrants), the
monthly cash ceiling provides MDAs with very limited scope to plan and manage
their spending and commitments. A return to quarterly expenditure ceilings which
will be used as a ceiling for approving commitments will restore this flexibility, and
will be backed by high-level political commitment to ensuring that all MDAs respect
appropriation ceilings.



GIFMIS design. It is critical that GIFMIS support the strengthened expenditure
control targeted above. In this regard, the GIFMIS team will review the warrant
(funds release) and expenditure control mechanism, and simplify it for adoption
within GIFMIS. The new computerized regime will allow MDAs to record
commitments when issued and invoices when received, and not just as funds are
available.

C. Regularizing Arrears and Other Claims
Background
32.
The budget continues to experience payments arrears following the
intensification of budget imbalances in the run up to the 2008 elections. As noted above,
the stock of budgetary arrears continued to increase in 2010. As a result, outstanding claims
in respect of budget arrears and public liabilities for SOE debts were estimated at 9.4 percent
of GDP at end-2010. The government gives a high priority to regularizing these claims. A
holistic approach is being adopted to tackle the arrears situation, drawing on technical
assistance provided by the IMF in early 2011.
Policy measures
33.
Avoiding new arrears. A first step will be to stem the emergence of new arrears.
This will require strengthened expenditure control, as described above.
34.
Monitoring arrears. Currently, the monitoring of expenditure arrears and other
claims is the responsibility of different MoFEP departments. Data tracking is limited (in
terms of stocks, payments, and new liabilities) and it is not straightforward to monitor the
extent of the arrears situation, or to track new trends. To address this situation, the MoFEP
Budget Department has been assigned overall responsibility for building and maintaining a
comprehensive database to track the full breadth of stocks and flows of arrears and other
claims on a monthly basis (program structural benchmark). Monthly reports will be prepared
to facilitate close monitoring, and quarterly reports will be provided to the cabinet, starting in
June 2011.
35.
Stock take and audits. To ensure that the above database is comprehensive and
accurate, the recent instruction to MDAs to report all claims as of end-2010 will be
reiterated, and MoFEP will instruct MDAs to report potential liabilities of state owned
enterprises. Where claims cannot be verified using normal budget validation procedures, an
independent audit will be sought; this is expected to be particularly important for the reported
liabilities of state-owned enterprises.
36.
Strategy to regularize arrears. A strategy for regularizing arrears will be developed
in the coming months, based on the enhanced claims database discussed in paragraph 34
above. Cash payments will need to be consistent with available fiscal space, and a large part
of the existing stock of liabilities will need to be regularized through the issue of special
purpose bonds or promissory notes that will spread the payment profile over 2012 and the
medium term. The macroeconomic framework is currently consistent with cash payments of
no more than GH¢ 1,290 million in 2011, and payments will not exceed this amount, unless
an updated fiscal framework based on strengthened fiscal performance is developed with the
IMF showing enhanced payment capacity. Priority in making 2011 cash payments is being

55
given to road contractors (to restart critical highway projects), the health and education funds
(where social projects have suffered), and to the district assembly common fund (critical for
rural development).
D. Managing the 2011 Budget
37.
The government is determined to strictly enforce its budget plans for 2011. The
budget continues to be subject to important risks. As a result, the government is taking steps
to ensure that its fiscal plans are achieved in 2011.


Fiscal monitoring is being strengthened. The government will monitor monthly
fiscal developments closely, with a particular focus on areas subject to slippages in
2010, such as recurrent expenditure on goods and services and discretionary domestic
investment spending. Adverse deviations from monthly budget projections will be
assessed to establish whether additional fiscal adjustment measures need to be
adopted. A new indicative target under the program has been established for non-oil
revenue collections. The planned monthly monitoring of the arrears situation will also
help with expenditure control.



New expenditure commitments will be strictly limited. Additional obligations will
be considered only where they are consistent with the government’s goals for fiscal
consolidation described in this memorandum and letter of intent.



Fiscal contingency plans have been identified. The fiscal framework for 2011 has
been designed to ensure that program targets for fiscal correction are achieved. A
contingency element equivalent to 1 percent of GDP within the expenditure budget
has not been appropriated to spending units. This will be a first source of savings, in
the event of fiscal slippages. If these savings are not sufficient, investment programs
will be downsized or deferred, where possible. In addition, a number of anticipated
revenues have not been included in the budget framework. These include receipts
from a gold mining company in lieu of royalty payments currently under negotiation,
which is expected to yield at least 0.2 percent of GDP, as well as tax receipts that
would accrue in the event of a transfer of oil production rights between Jubilee field
investors (which could significantly exceed 1 percent of GDP). Based on trends
through March, the government also intends to exceed the program’s tax collection
targets. As these additional revenues are realized, they will be set aside as a fiscal
contingency fund.

56
IV. OTHER STRUCTURAL FISCAL REFORMS
A. Public Sector Reform and Payroll Management
38.
Ghana has started to migrate its public workforce onto a new public pay
structure, a process that will ensure pay equity and simplify future pay negotiations.
Some previously low-wage employees have seen large pay increases; for others, the impact
on salaries will be more limited. The cost of the new pay regime will be determined once the
520,000 public sector employees have been mapped from the old to the new pay structure
and after determining the treatment of some former allowances, which will be integrated into
base pay. The government has estimated that the cost of completing the migration to the new
pay structure at GH¢ 420 million per annum (about 0.8 percent of GDP). The migration of
the Education Service has been completed in March 2011, with an estimated full-year cost of
GH¢ 300 million. The government will manage the remaining 2011 migration to the single
spine within the allocated budget.
39.
The process of migrating all remaining non-security subvented agencies to the
Integrated Personnel and Payroll Database (IPPD) remains to be completed (structural
benchmark for September 2009, extended to July 2010). The slippage relative to earlier
migration plans was partly due to a push-back from some agencies, difficulties in
harmonizing allowance rates within some subvented agencies, and the need to review some
agency-specific allowances. As of February 2011, 97 out of 137 subvented agencies have
been migrated onto the IPPD. The priority of completing the IPPD migration has been
enhanced by the use of this platform for the payroll audit being conducted by an external
consultant. Given this, the government plans to complete the migration of all non-security
subvented agencies by June 2011. The current stand-alone IPPD database will be integrated
and upgraded into the GIFMIS once roll-out of the latter has been completed. Pending this
integration, for agencies already on the payroll database, new recruitments are verified by the
CAGD on a continuous basis to ensure appropriate budget authorization. As part of the
reforms to contain the wage bill, independent consultants were contracted to review which
subvented agencies should stay on government subvention, liquidated, partially or fully
commercialized. The report recommended that 12 out of the 132 subvented agencies assessed
should be closed, 71 should remain on government subvention, while 16 could be partially or
fully commercialized. The lack of adequate information prevented the report to make a
recommendation on the remaining subvented agencies. The list was submitted to Cabinet for
decision in March 2011 (structural benchmark for December 2010).
40.
Efforts are underway to better monitor public wage and pension payments. The
government conducted its own payroll audits of the two largest public employers, the Health
Services in 2007, and the Education Services in 2010, eliminating about 2,000 ghost workers
in the first and 10,000 in the second. The process of migrating staff to the new computerized
single spine pay structure is also helping to confirm staffing numbers. To strengthen controls
over payrolls and public pensions, a pilot program will introduce biometric identification

57
technology. A pilot program covering more than 100,000 public pension recipients is planned
for completion by August-September 2011. An initial review of the pension records for this
exercise has revealed an implausible number of recipients, confirming scope for savings from
cleaning the system. This process will subsequently be extended to all public sector
employees.
B. Energy Sector Reforms
41.
The government is committed to cost-recovery pricing of energy products.
Earlier efforts to shelter consumers from increases in global energy costs resulted in large
losses to public utility companies that remain a drain on the budget.
Electricity sector
42.
Electricity tariffs were raised to cost-recovery levels in June 2010. World Bank
has reviewed this new tariff structure, including the impact of an August 2010 downward
revision in some tariffs. In its assessment, the new tariff structure is consistent with a return
to financial viability in the power sector. Quarterly reviews of the tariff structure will be
conducted to ensure continuing cost-recovery pricing. Based on access to relatively cheap
natural gas as a result of the reopening of the West Africa Gas Pipeline (WAGP) power
generation costs are calculated to have fallen; as result, the Public Utilities Regulatory
Commission, has calculated that the tariff structure should be reduced by a weighted average
of 17 percent, effective March 1, 2011. The cost structure will be reassessed with a view to
setting a new tariff effective June 1, 2011.
Refined petroleum products
43.
Petroleum product prices were adjusted in early-January 2011. Petroleum pump
prices were increased by 30 percent to full cost-recovery levels; gasoline prices rose to the
equivalent of $3.81/gallon, up from a preceding $2.93/gallon. This increase was sustained
notwithstanding widespread protests.
44.
A hedging scheme using call options adopted from October 2010 provides
temporary protection against further upward movements in oil prices. The government
has purchased monthly call options that generate revenues in the event of upside shocks to
global oil prices; under these conditions, the revenues will be used to cover temporary delays
in adjusting domestic petroleum product prices to higher cost-recovery levels. The hedging
operations are calculated to cost around GH¢140 million (0.3 percent of GDP) on an annual
basis; this cost is included in the budget, and will not be exceeded.
45.
Hedging incomes will provide temporary relief from the global rise in petroleum
product prices during 2011. Following further increases in global oil prices, the prices
established for petroleum products in January are no longer at cost recovery level. As

58
envisaged under the hedging scheme, the accumulated and anticipated revenues accruing
from call options will be used to provide temporary relief from higher market prices.
Hedging revenues, together with a small windfall income from Ghana’s oil export activities,
are estimated at 0.3–0.4 percent of GDP. With this support, it is anticipated that petroleum
pump prices can be maintained at current levels through at least mid-2011 without the need
for a price increase. Closer to that date, the need for an adjustment in pump prices will be
assessed, based on trends in global prices, the operations of the hedging scheme, and the
broader fiscal situation. The continued appropriateness of petroleum pump prices within this
context will be a focus for the next ECF review.
46.
Past under-pricing of petroleum products saddled the Tema Oil Refinery (TOR)
with large losses. As a result of its weak balance sheet, the refinery was idled for a portion of
2010, and a strategy for financial and commercial viability was needed (December 2010
structural benchmark). This was partly achieved by clearing TOR’s large overdraft liabilities
to GCB through cash payments from the budget and, more importantly, issuance of
government bonds to GCB in exchange for its TOR claims. Following these steps, TOR has
regained the financial viability to operate in the petroleum market without ongoing
government support. Looking further ahead, TOR still has issues of efficiency and
competitiveness as well as some long term debt obligations that may need to be refinanced.
TOR has developed its own proposals for this commercial modernization. A task force
established by the Ministry of Energy is reviewing these plans, and they will be provided to
the World Bank for its assessment.
C. Oil Revenue Management
47.
The government remains committed to establishing a transparent framework
for managing petroleum and gas revenues. Drawing on international experience, a draft
Petroleum Revenue Management Bill was submitted to parliament in 2010 (structural
benchmark) and approved in March 2011. Receipts will be managed through a dedicated
Petroleum Account, to be established at the Bank of Ghana, with full fiscal reporting to
Parliament and the public, subject to stringent requirements for auditing of account
transactions. Quarterly audits of petroleum accounts will be conducted by the BoG, and
annual external audits will be carried out by the Auditor General or an auditor contracted by
him. Portions of oil revenues will be used to finance budget expenditure; the remainder will
be saved in two funds—one for “future generations” and the other for smoothing
expenditures in the face of commodity price or production shocks. Consistent with the bill,
funds allocated to GNPC for its investments will be incorporated in the budget. The creation
of these funds would improve medium term budgetary framework of the country.

59
D. Public Debt Management
48.
Good progress is being achieved in strengthening the government’s debt
management framework. The debt management division is being reorganized with units
specialized by functional areas. A head of unit will be identified for each of the four units:
domestic debt unit, external debt unit, on-lending and guaranteed unit, risk management and
policy analysis unit. With the support of the World Bank, a functional review of the debt
management division will be conducted with the objective of identifying skill needs, and
ensuring effective coordination of the various units. Monitoring of SOEs’ borrowing has
been intensified. Quarterly meetings are held with major SOEs to review their operational
activity and balance sheets, in order to identify risks of delayed payments or defaults.
49.
Debt management reforms. A debt management strategy was developed with
technical support from the IMF and World Bank, and published on the MoFEP website in
December 2010 (structural benchmark). This strategy will help the government better
analyze the implications of alternative borrowing options within a coherent framework taking
into account the cost and risk implications of various borrowing options. The next version of
the strategy, to be developed by end-2011, will take stock of emerging debt management
risks and policies to address them. Guidelines have been developed and published for the
appraisal and selection of projects financed by nonconcessional external financing (structural
benchmark).
50.
In 2010, the government contracted new external loans totaling about
$2.8 billion. These focused on its sectoral priorities in health, agriculture, rural development,
highways, and communication. The new loans included a $1.5 billion lending arrangement
with a Korean company, providing financing on concessional terms for the construction over
five-year period of housing for public sector employees. Commercial external borrowing in
2010 amounted to $329.2 million and was below the ceiling under the ECF arrangement.
51.
Borrowing plans will be tailored to debt sustainability. Based on the latest debt
service indicators calculated using Ghana’s rebased national accounts, Ghana’s risks of debt
distress have declined. Public debt at end-2010 was equivalent to 43 percent of GDP, and
new borrowing will be carefully calibrated to levels that can be serviced over the medium
term.
52.
In 2011, commercial borrowing will not exceed $800 million. GNPC envisages a
commercial borrowing need of $300 million, in large part to cover its share of investments in
the oil and gas sectors. Outside the oil and gas sectors, the government plans to limit new
commercial borrowing to $500 million. The process of prioritizing projects is continuing;
goals include ensuring that public services have up-to-date equipment, and financing
machinery for rural development.

60
IV. MONETARY, FINANCIAL, AND EXCHANGE RATE ISSUES
A. Monetary and Exchange Rate Policy
53.
Monetary policy will continue to be guided by the Bank of Ghana’s inflation
targeting regime. The successful convergence of inflation in 2010 to the BoG target
reflected the lagged impact of earlier policy tightening, exchange rate stability, and the
impact of favorable crop yields on food prices. Looking forward, the BoG intends to seek a
modest further reduction in inflation, with the centre point of the target band reduced from
9½ percent in December 2010 to 9 percent in December 2011.
54.
Policies will be alert to upside inflation risks. Over the coming year, further
disinflation will be complicated by possible domestic spillovers from higher global
commodity prices and a gathering momentum of domestic activity. Domestic liquidity also
rose strongly in 2010, driven by a balance of payments surplus and reserve build-up. The
Bank of Ghana is monitoring conditions closely, and stands ready to tighten monetary
policies, as needed, to head off any resurgence in inflationary pressures.
55.
The Bank of Ghana will continue to maintain a flexible exchange rate regime.
Exchange rate policy is designed to support Ghana’s inflation target. Over the year ahead, the
balance of payments is projected to remain in surplus, reflecting high commodity export
prices, the start of oil production, and continuing portfolio capital inflows. Under these
circumstances, the Bank of Ghana expects to build further its reserve cover to provide a
larger cushion to manage potential external volatility, including in nonresident portfolio
investments. Inflationary risks arising from the liquidity impact of reserve accumulation will
be mitigated by sterilization actions using domestic paper.
B. Financial Sector Policies
56.
In the financial sector, the priority is to continue with efforts to strengthen
banks. Several specific areas of action are underway or envisaged:


TOR debts and Ghana Commercial Bank. In early 2011, the government provided
Ghana Commercial Bank (GCB) with interest-bearing government securities
equivalent to GH¢ 570 million (1 percent of GDP) to clear virtually all of TOR’s
remaining liabilities to GCB. Outstanding is a US$ 50 million (equivalent to
GH¢ 75 million) loan to BOG that was extended to GCB and the on-lent to TOR. In
the coming months, GCB will submit to the Bank of Ghana an updated business
model, covering among other topics its plans for further broadening its customer base
and strengthening risk management.



Audit of banks. A group of banks will be selected for independent external audit,
including banks considered most at risk from impaired portfolios. External

61
consultants are being selected to help draft the terms of references for these audits,
and the audits should be completed by November 2011. The outcome of the audits
will inform the strategy for addressing problem institutions.


Bank supervision. Efforts would focus on developing new supervisory guidelines
and strengthening the technical capacity of supervisors. The recent hiring of over
40 new staff in the supervision department is aimed to address the imminent
succession problem due to retirements. A training program is being developed for
these and existing staff, aimed at bringing BoG’s supervisory approaches into line
with the financial reforms and structural changes in Ghana’s banking industry.



Central bank resolution powers. The recent FSAP update identified some gaps in
the Bank of Ghana’s legal arsenal for resolving troubled institutions. Legal language
is being developed, with a view to parliamentary submission by end-March 2012.



Bank of Ghana ownership of banks. As an interim measure to address the potential
conflict of interest as supervisor and part-owner of the two banks and to pave way for
the disposal of BoG’s shareholdings in these two banks, the ownership interests were
transferred by a Deed of Transfer to an independent Financial Investment Trust. The
Trust is registered with the Registrar of Companies and has an independent Board of
Trustees and the returns accruing on the investments are to be used for social projects.
A full exit strategy from BoG shareholding in these two banks is being considered,
drawing on Fund technical advice.
VI. OTHER PROGRAM ISSUES

57.
Ghana’s Shared Growth and Development Agenda (GSGDA) has been
published as an updated poverty reduction strategy for 2010–13. It emphasizes structural
transformation of the Ghanaian economy, based in part on industrialization in the agricultural
and natural resource sectors. The cost of meeting the GSGDA’s objectives was calculated in
close collaboration with affected spending units. The aggregate cost significantly exceeds
Ghana’s projected fiscal space, and the financing gap will guide efforts to identify additional
funding and use public private partnerships to meet infrastructure needs.
VII. PROGRAM DESIGN AND MONITORING
58.
Program targets and benchmarks. Quantitative program targets are documented in
Appendix Table 2. Structural benchmarks are documented in Appendix Table 3. A few minor
modifications have been made to the program design, as described further in the Technical
Memorandum of Understanding (TMU):

62


Indicative target on revenue mobilization. To monitor progress toward the
government’s goal for boosting tax collections, the ECF arrangement will include a
new indicative target for quarterly non-oil tax collections.



External nonconcessional borrowing limits. For greater clarity, the limits on
contracting or guaranteeing external nonconcessional debts have been redefined on an
annual basis, rather than as before on a cumulative basis from the beginning of the
program.



Definition of external debt/borrowing. This covers now any debt/borrowing that is
denominated in foreign currency, as oppose to the earlier residency criterion.



External arrears have been more precisely defined in the TMU to clarify coverage
and simplify monitoring.

59.
Phasing of disbursements under ECF arrangement. Total disbursements under the
ECF arrangement would be unchanged (Appendix Table 4), though some financing would be
deferred from 2010–11 to 2012. This is consistent with Ghana’s stronger-than-expected
international reserve position.

APPENDIX II—ATTACHMENT II
TECHNICAL MEMORANDUM OF UNDERSTANDING
Arrangement Under the Extended Credit Facility 2011–12
1.
This technical memorandum of understanding (TMU) defines the variables subject to
quantitative targets (performance criteria and indicative targets), as specified in the
authorities’ Letter of Intent (LOI) [date]. It also describes the methods to be used to assess
the program performance and the information requirements to ensure adequate monitoring of
the targets. The authorities will consult with the Fund before modifying measures contained
in this letter, or adopting new measures that would deviate from the goals of the program,
and provide the Fund with the necessary information for program monitoring.
2.
Program exchange rate: The exchange rates for the purpose of the program of the
Ghanaian cedi (GH¢) to the U.S. dollar will be GH¢1.5 per US$1, which is calculated as the
average of buying and selling exchange rates reported by banks to the Bank of Ghana. The
exchange rates to other currencies will be calculated as the average of buying and selling
exchange rates against the U.S. dollar.
I.

Quantitative Program Indicators

3.
For program monitoring purposes, the performance criteria are set for end-June 2011,
end-December 2011, and end-March 2012, while indicative targets are set for end-March
2011, end-September 2011, and end-June 2012. Performance criteria, indicative targets, and
adjusters are calculated as cumulative flows from the beginning of the calendar year.



5.

72
6.
A target is set for the twelve-month rate of consumer price inflation, with triggers on
discussions or consultations with the Fund if inflation moves outside specified inner and
outer bands.
A. Government
7.
Definition: The government is defined as comprising the central government, all
special funds (including the Education Trust Fund, the Road Fund, the District Assembly
Common Fund, and the National Health Insurance Fund), and all subvented and other
government agencies that are classified as government in the Bank of Ghana (BoG)
Statement of Accounts (SOA). The Social Security and National Insurance Trust (SSNIT)
and public enterprises, including Cocobod, are excluded from the definition of government
8.
The government’s total tax revenue includes all revenue collected by the Ghana
Revenue Authority (GRA) (direct taxes, indirect taxes, trade taxes) whether they result from
past, current, or future obligations. Receipts are recorded on a cash basis.
9.
Oil tax revenue is defined as the government’s net proceeds from the sale of oil,
including corporate tax and royalties paid by oil companies, excluding any revenue
associated with GNPC’s carried interests in oil fields.
10.
Non-oil tax revenue will be measured as total government tax revenue less oil tax
revenue (as defined in paragraph 9).
11.
The fiscal deficit is measured as total financing extended to the government (as
defined in paragraph 7 above), comprising the sum of net foreign borrowing (as defined in
paragraph 15 below), net domestic financing (defined in paragraph 14 below), exceptional
financing (including HIPC and MDRI relief against loan repayments falling due), and
receipts from net divestitures.
12.
Domestic payments arrears will be measured as the sum of three components. The
first component, arrears to the government’s statutory funds, represents any delay of more
than one month in revenue transfers to these statutory fund, relative to the normal payment
schedule (typically monthly or quarterly, and defined as a specific percentage of the previous
month or quarter’s revenue collections).1 The second component, arrears to contractors, is
defined as payments in local and foreign currencies that are due and not settled within
30 days after the end of the fiscal year. The third component, wages and pensions arrears, is
defined as payments outstanding after the agreed date for payment to staff or the social
security fund. In the case of pay awards, arrears are calculated as the amount outstanding at
1

Transfers to the statutory funds are scheduled as follows: (i) District Assemblies Common Fund—quarterly,
with a one-quarter lag; (ii) Social Security Fund, National Health Fund, Ghana Education Trust Fund, Road
Fund, Petroleum-related Fund,—monthly, with a one-month lag.

73
the date at which the award specifies the first payments should be made. Net changes in the
stock of arrears to contractors at end-March 2011 are as defined in the TMU attached to the
Letter of Intent of May 13, 2010. Starting at end-June 2011, the net change in the stock of
arrears to contractors will be measured at each end-quarter as the accumulation of arrears
within the current fiscal year, less amounts settled in the current fiscal year in respect of the
claims accumulated in previous fiscal years.
13.
The government will continue to report poverty-related expenditures, including
the use of funds from the enhanced Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) Initiative.
Budgeted poverty spending for these categories will be taken from each year’s final
appropriations bill and will include spending financed by the government or donors or from
internally generated funds. Actual poverty-related spending will be identified using the last
3 digits of the 15-digit chart of accounts of the CAGD’s current NETS and the subcomponent
that is financed through HIPC Initiative debt relief. This data will be supplemented with that
proportion of transfers to the District Assembly Common Fund, the Ghana Educational Trust
Fund, and the Road Fund, which the government considers as poverty-related. Accordingly,
actual poverty spending will exclude some donor-supported expenditure not currently
captured by the CAGD.
14.
Net domestic financing of government is defined as the change in net credit to
government by the banking system (i.e., the Bank of Ghana plus deposit money banks) plus
the net change in holdings of treasury bills and other government securities by the nonbank
sector, excluding divestiture receipts. Such credit will also exclude treasury bills issued for
open market operation purposes from January 1, 2003 onward (the holdings of which are
excluded from the BoG Treasury Department’s Debt Registry of central government
securities, and the proceeds of which are sterilized in deposits held as other BoG liabilities,
as defined in the monetary template provided to the IMF on December 3, 2003).
15.
Net foreign financing of government is defined as the sum of project and program
loans by official donors, commercial external borrowing, minus amortization due.
16.
Outstanding net credit to the government by the Bank of Ghana comprises the
sum of claims on government (SOA codes 0401 and 050101-4), including overdrafts of the
government with the BoG, less government deposits (1101 including the main HIPC
Initiative receiving account, and 1202) as defined in the monetary template.
17.
Outstanding net credit by deposit money banks comprises deposit money bank
(DMB) holdings of government securities at cost of purchase value, as reported by the BoG
Treasury Department’s Debt Registry, plus overdrafts less government deposits as reported
by DMBs in the revised BSD2 report forms (and defined in the Monetary Template), plus
deferred accrued interest on their holdings of inflation-indexed bonds.
18.
Nonbank financing is the difference between total net cash receipts to the treasury
main cash account (issues/redemptions account when it becomes operational) from the

74
sale/repurchase of government securities, less the corresponding net cash value received from
the BoG and DMBs as indicated on the Debt Registry by holder at discount value, plus
deferred accrued interest on their holdings of inflation-indexed bonds. For each test date, any
adjustment by the BoG to the data reported by individual DMBs, on account of their
misclassification of government or for other reasons, will be reported to the Fund.
B. Consultation Mechanism on Inflation
19.
A consultation mechanism adopted for the twelve-month rate of inflation.
Inflation is measured by the headline consumer price index (CPI) published by the Ghana
Statistical Services. Quarterly consultation bands are specified in Appendix Tables 1 and 2
attached to the memorandum of economic and financial policies. The bands are defined for
each quarter and apply to the three month inflation outturns in each quarter. Appendix Tables
1 and 2 attached to the memorandum of economic and financial policies show the relevant
bands for each quarter. Whenever the twelve-month rate of CPI inflation moves outside a
specific band, this would trigger a consultation/discussion with the Fund.
20.
Breach of the outer band. The authorities will complete consultations with the
Executive Board of the Fund on the proposed policy response before requesting further
disbursements under the program when the observed twelve-month rate of CPI inflation
moves outside the outer band as specified for each quarter in Appendix Tables 1 and 2 of the
memorandum of economic and financial policies. The authorities will not be able to request
any further disbursements under the ECF arrangement if the observed twelve-month rate of
CPI inflation moves outside of the outer band until the consultation with the Executive Board
has taken place. In line with our accountability principles, we are committed to report to the
public the reasons for any breach of the outer bands, and our policy response.
21.
Breach of the inner band. The authorities will conduct discussions with the Fund
staff when the observed twelve-month rate of CPI inflation falls outside the inner band as
specified for each quarter in Appendix Tables 1 and 2 of the memorandum of economic and
financial policies.
C. Bank of Ghana
22.
Net foreign assets are defined in the monetary survey as short- and long-term foreign
assets minus liabilities of the BoG that are contracted with nonresidents. Short-term foreign
assets include: monetary gold (valued at the spot market rate for gold, US$/fine ounce,
London), holdings of SDRs, reserve position and HIPC Initiative trust investment in the IMF,
the HIPC Initiative Umbrella SDR account (all as reported by the IMF), foreign notes and
travelers checks, foreign securities, positive balances with correspondent banks, and other
positive short-term or time deposits. Short-term foreign liabilities include foreign currency
liabilities contracted by the BoG at original maturities of one year or less (including
overdrafts), outstanding liabilities to the IMF, and deposits of international institutions at the

75
BoG. Long-term foreign assets and liabilities are comprised of: other foreign assets (BoG
statement of accounts code 303), investments abroad (a subset of 60201), other long-term
liabilities to nonresidents (a subset of 1103), and bilateral payment agreements (305). All
values not in U.S. dollars are to be converted to U.S. dollars at the program exchange rate
defined in paragraph 2. A more detailed listing of accounts to be included in the measure of
net foreign assets is contained in the monetary template referred to in paragraph 14 above.
23.
Net international reserves of the BoG are defined for program monitoring purposes
and in the balance of payments as short-term foreign assets of the BoG, minus short-term
external liabilities. To the extent that short-term foreign assets are not fully convertible
external assets readily available to and controlled by the BoG (that is, they are pledged or
otherwise encumbered external assets, including, but not limited to, the HIPC umbrella SDR
account), they will be excluded from the definition of net international reserves. Net
international reserves are also defined to include net swap transactions (receivable less
payable) and exclude all positive foreign currency deposits at the BoG held by resident
deposit money banks, public institutions, nonfinancial public enterprises, other financial
institutions, and the private sector. All values not in U.S. dollars are to be converted to
U.S. dollars at the program exchange rate defined in paragraph 2. A more detailed listing of
accounts to be included in the measure of net international reserves is contained in the
monetary template referred to in the paragraph 14 above.
24.
Net domestic assets of the Bank of Ghana are defined as the difference between
reserve money and net foreign assets of the BoG, excluding the HIPC Umbrella SDR
account, converted from U.S. dollars to cedis at the program exchange rate.
D. External Debt and Debt Service
25.
For the purposes of this technical memorandum of understanding, the definition
of debt is set out in point 9 of the Guidelines on Performance Criteria with Respect to
External Debt (see below). It not only refers to debt, but also to commitments contracted or
guaranteed for which value has not been received. The definition of debt is as follows:
9 (a) For the purpose of these guidelines, the term “debt” will be understood to mean
a current, i.e., not contingent, liability, created under a contractual arrangement
through the provision of value in the form of financial and nonfinancial assets
(including currency) or services, and which requires the obligor to make one or more
payments in the form of assets (including currency) or services, at some future
point(s) in time; these payments will discharge the principal and/or interest liabilities
incurred under the contract. Debts can take a number of forms, the primary ones
being as follows:
(i) loans, i.e., advances of money to the obligor by the lender made on the
basis of an undertaking that the obligor will repay the funds in the future

76
(including deposits, bonds, debentures, commercial loans and buyers’ credits)
and temporary exchanges of assets that are equivalent to fully collateralized
loans under which the obligor is required to repay the funds, and usually pay
interest, by repurchasing the collateral from the buyer in the future (such as
repurchase agreements and official swap arrangements);
(ii) suppliers’ credits, i.e., contracts where the supplier permits the obligor to
defer payments until some time after the date on which the goods are
delivered or services are provided; and
(iii) leases, i.e., arrangements under which property is provided which the
lessee has the right to use for one or more specified period(s) of time that are
usually shorter than the total expected service life of the property, while the
lessor retains the title to the property. For the purpose of the guideline, the
debt is the present value (at the inception of the lease) of all lease payments
expected to be made during the period of the agreement excluding those
payments that cover the operation, repair, or maintenance of the property.
(b) Under the definition of debt set out in point 9(a) above, arrears, penalties, and
judicially awarded damages arising from the failure to make payment under a
contractual obligation that constitutes debt are debt. Failure to make payment on an
obligation that is not considered debt under this definition (e.g., payment on delivery)
will not give rise to debt.

77
26.
For the purposes of the ceiling on the contracting or guaranteeing of new nonconcessional external debt, external debt is any debt as defined in paragraph 27, which is
denominated in foreign currency, i.e., currency other than Ghanaian cedis (GH¢). Similarly,
external borrowing is borrowing denominated in foreign currency.2
27.
Nonconcessional medium- and long-term external debt is defined as external debt
contracted or guaranteed by the government (defined in paragraph 7), the BoG, and specific
public enterprises (defined in paragraph 31) on nonconcessional terms (see paragraph 34) and
denominated in foreign currencies, with an original maturity of more than one year, provided
that debt maturing within one year which has been extended beyond one year from its
original date, pursuant to the contract which allows for maturity extension, would be
considered medium to long term. Medium- and long-term external debt and its
concessionality will be reported by the Aid and Debt Management Unit of the Ministry of
Finance and Economic Planning, and will be measured in U.S. dollars at current exchange
rates.
28.
For the purpose of the ceiling on the accumulation of external payment arrears,
external payment arrears will accrue when undisputed payments such as interest or
amortization on debts of the government (as defined in paragraph 7) to non-residents are not
made within the terms of the contract.
E. Ceiling on the Contracting or Guaranteeing of New
Nonconcessional External Debt
29.
A ceiling applies to the contracting and guaranteeing of new medium-to-long term
nonconcessional external debt by the government and the BoG, and the following public
enterprises: (i) Tema Oil Refinery; (ii) Ghana National Petroleum Corporation; (iii) Bulk Oil
Storage and Transport Corporation; (iv) Volta River Authority; and (v) Electricity Company
of Ghana. The ceiling applies to debt and commitments contracted or guaranteed for which
value has not yet been received.
30.
The ceiling on the contracting or guaranteeing of new nonconcessional external debt
(US$800 million) comprises the following two subceilings: (i) A subceiling for the maximum
amount of nonconcessional external debt in the oil and gas sector that can be contracted or
guaranteed for oil and gas exploration and production projects in Ghana and to acquire equity
stakes in companies undertaking oil and gas exploration and production in Ghana
2

(A) The term “debt” has the meaning set forth in point No. 9 of the Guidelines on Performance
Criteria with Respect to Foreign Debt (see paragraph 25). This includes overdrafts on accounts with
correspondent banks. (B) Excluded from this performance criterion are normal import-related credits,
pre-export financing credits of public enterprises, cocoa loans collateralized by cocoa contracts, and
individual leases with a value of less than US$100,000.

78
(US$300 million); and (ii) A subceiling for the maximum amount of nonconcessional
external debt that can be contracted or guaranteed in any sector other than the oil and gas
sector (US$500 million).
31.
Excluded from the ceiling are (i) the use of Fund resources; and (ii) lending from the
World Bank, the African Development Bank, and the International Fund for Agricultural
Development.
32.
For program purposes, a debt is concessional if it includes a grant element of at least
35 percent, calculated as follows: the grant element of a debt is the difference between the
net present value (NPV) of debt and its nominal value, expressed as a percentage of the
nominal value of the debt. The NPV of debt at the time of its contracting is calculated by
discounting the future stream of payments of debt service due on this debt. The discount rates
used for this purpose are the currency specific commercial interest reference rates (CIRRs),
published by the Organization for Economic Cooperation Development (OECD). For debt
with a maturity of at least 15 years, the ten-year-average CIRR will be used to calculate the
NPV of debt and, hence, its grant element. For debt with a maturity of less than 15 years, the
six-month average CIRR will be used. To both the ten-year and six-month averages, the same
margins for differing repayment periods as those used by the OECD would continue to be
added (0.75 percent for repayment periods of less than 15 years, 1 percent for 15 to 19 years,
1.15 percent for 20 to 29 years, and 1.25 percent for 30 years or more). Loans provided by a
private entity will not be considered concessional unless accompanied by a grant or grant
element provided by a foreign official entity, such as both components constitute an
integrated financing package with a combined grant element equal to at least 35 percent.
F. Adjustors to the Program Targets
33.

Program’s quantitative targets are subject to the following adjustors:

Overall fiscal deficit of the government
34.
The deficit ceilings for 2011–12 will be adjusted for excesses and shortfalls in loans
and grants as defined below, relative to the program assumptions in the table below. The
fiscal deficit will be adjusted:
(i)

3

Upward (or downward) for the full amount of any excess (or shortfall) in
concessional project loans. Thus, foreign-financed investment projects, which
are not under the short-term control of the government, would be unconstrained,
varying in line with project loan financing.3

No adjuster is needed for project grants, as shortfalls/excesses in project grants are precisely offset by
shortfalls/excesses in foreign-financed capital spending, leaving the fiscal deficit unaffected.

79
(ii)

Downward by 50 percent of any shortfall in concessional program
loans of GH¢150 million or less, and downward by the full amount of any
shortfall beyond this amount. Thus, for shortfalls of up to GH¢150 million in
external loans, the government would have the option of balancing cuts in
expenditures with resort to additional domestic financing. The possible resort to
additional domestic financing from this adjuster is effectively capped at GH¢75
million, limiting potential crowding-out of private sector credit;
4

(iii)

Upward for the full amount of any excess in concessional program loans,
where these are used to repay outstanding domestic arrears at a more rapid pace
than programmed.5

(iv)

Upward by 50 percent of any shortfall in program grants of
GH¢150 million or less, with no adjustment for any shortfall beyond this
amount. As with adjuster (ii), this gives the option of balancing cuts in spending
with additional resort to domestic financing. The latter is capped, again, at
GH¢75 million;6

(v)

Downward by the full amount of any excess of program grants, less any
use of program grants to repay outstanding domestic arrears at a more rapid
pace than programmed; and

For the net international reserve (NIR) floors will be adjusted upward for any excess
of budget grants and loans relative to the program baseline (see paragraph 25), except where
this financing is used to repay outstanding domestic arrears at a more rapid pace than
programmed.
4

Program grants and loans are also referred to as budget grants and loans.
Adjusters (iv) and (v) ensure that higher than programmed budget support (grants or loans) are used to repay
domestic expenditure arrears as a first priority.
6
The combined scope for additional domestic financing from adjusters (ii) and (iii) is thus GH¢150 million.
5

80
Net domestic financing of the government
36.
The ceiling on net domestic financing (NDF) will be adjusted upward by 50 percent
of any shortfall in concessional program loans and grants relative to the program (see
paragraph 37), up to a maximum adjustment of GH¢75 million for shortfalls in each of
program loans and grants (and a maximum combined adjustment of GH¢150 million). For
higher than programmed loans and grants, the ceiling will be adjusted downward by the full
amount, except where these loans or grants are used to repay outstanding domestic arrears at
a more rapid pace than programmed. The ceiling will also be adjusted upward by the full
amount for a reduction in net arrears paid through bond issuance.
F. Provision of Data to the Fund
37.
Data with respect to the variables subject to performance criteria and indicative
targets will be provided to Fund staff on a monthly basis with a lag of no more than eight
weeks (except for select data for which the reporting lag is explicitly specified in Table 1).
The authorities will transmit promptly to Fund staff any data revisions. For any information

(are) not specifically defined in this memorandum, the authorities will consult with Fund
staff.

INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND
GHANA
Joint IMF and World Bank Debt Sustainability Analysis
Prepared by the staffs of
the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank
Approved by Michael Atingi-Ego and Dominique Desruelle (IMF)
and Marcelo Giugale and Jeffrey Lewis (World Bank)
May 12, 2011
Given risks to the fiscal outlook and the potential external spillovers of a less favorable fiscal
outcome, Ghana’s risk of external debt distress is assessed to remain at a moderate level,
unchanged from the 2010 debt sustainability assessment. However, Ghana’s debt burden
indicators have improved since the June 2010 assessment. External debt burden indicators
are projected to remain well below their respective indicative thresholds, provided that the
programmed fiscal consolidation is achieved and external public sector borrowing is
restrained. At the same time, overall public sector debt is projected to increase moderately in
relation to GDP over the long term. If the planned fiscal consolidation is achieved without a
substantial further debt build-up, an improved rating of low risk of debt distress could be
considered in a future assessment.
I. BACKGROUND
1.
This debt sustainability analysis (DSA) was prepared jointly by the staffs of the
World Bank and IMF, based on debt data provided by the Ghanaian authorities. It
updates the June 2010 debt sustainability assessment prepared by IMF staff for the combined
first and second reviews under the Extended Credit facility (ECF).1
Recent debt developments
2.
Public debt at end-2010 was higher than in the 2010 DSA (Text Table 1). Total
public debt at end-year was an estimated 39 percent of GDP, 1 percentage points higher than

1

Appendix II, IMF Country Report No. 10/178, June 2010.

84
projected in the 2010 DSA.2 This reflected a larger-than-programmed fiscal deficit and
associated increases in domestic financing.

3.
The government continued to accumulate domestic payment arrears in 2010. At
end-year, the outstanding stock of arrears and public liabilities in respect of SEO debts was
estimated at 9 percent of GDP, which was not reflected in the public debt data. About onethird of these liabilities will be cleared in 2011 through a 2-to-1 mix of cash payments and
bond issues. This element of arrears therefore adds to the debt balance at end-2011. The
residual arrears balance is assumed to be regularized through cash outlays or bond issues in
2012–13, adding to the debt burden over this period. The authorities’ program includes
policies to avoid the reoccurrence of arrears.
4.
Ghana’s external debt stock has risen substantially since its MDRI debt relief.
External debt totaled US$6.1 billion at end-2010, up from US$2.1 billion in 2006 after debt
relief under the Multilateral Debt Reduction Initiative (MDRI).3 The increase largely reflects
borrowing from bilateral and multilateral institutions, including under the IMF ECF program.
Non-concessional borrowing includes Ghana first sovereign bond issued in 2007
(US$750 million, maturing in 2017); subsequently, commercial borrowing has been at a
more modest pace (Text Table 2).4

2

Data for state-owned enterprises are not available while private sector debt data are inherently weak. The data
also exclude the outstanding stock of domestic payment arrears, which is discussed further below.

It has doubled as a percentage of GDP during this period.

Non-resident holdings of government securities issued in the local currency are part of domestic public debt.

Box 1: Rebasing of National Accounts
Rebased national accounts for 2006–09 were adopted in November 2010. The revisions included
improved data sources, a change in the base year from 1993 to 2006, and updated compilation
methodologies (the 1993 system of national accounts, and the latest version of the industrial
classification standards, ISIC version 4).
Under the new data, national incomes have been revised up by an average of 65 percent during
2006–09, while the average real growth rate for these years is about one percentage point higher
than earlier estimated. On the rebased data, the gross national income per capita is estimated to
have reached US$1,240 in 2010 (using Atlas method), making Ghana a lower middle income
country.
The updated accounts reflect better the sectoral composition of economic activity, and capture
more effectively service sector and informal activities. The revised data highlight the increasing
importance of the service sector, which accounts for about one-half of the economy and explains
in part the faster growth rate in the sample period (particularly in the information/communication
and financial services).

II. ASSUMPTIONS UNDERLYING THE DSA
Baseline macroeconomic assumptions
5.
The current DSA macroeconomic assumptions are broadly in line with the 2010
exercise (Text Table 3 and Box 2). Key differences between the 2010 and 2011 exercises are
a somewhat weaker initial fiscal position and changes in the assumptions regarding the mix
of external borrowing (concessional vs. non-concessional) and the terms of financing. The
projected real interest rate on public debt would be lower by about 0.5 percent per annum. It
reflects a downward revision of interest payments on existing external borrowing, which
more than offsets a higher projected interest rate on domestic debt. The rebased nominal
GDP also affects a number of debt ratios.
6.
The DSA depends importantly on successful fiscal consolidation in 2011–12. The
primary fiscal balance is assumed to be close to zero during 2010–15, which will require a
fiscal correction of about 4 percentage points of GDP from 2010 levels (Text Table 3).

Box 2: Baseline Macroeconomic Assumptions
Real GDP growth: After a slowing of growth to below 5 percent in 2009, growth recovered to an
estimated 5.7 percent in 2010. It is projected to accelerate to 13.7 percent in 2011, boosted by rising oil
production and robust expansion of the non-oil economy. Over 2012–31, non-oil growth is cautiously
projected to average 5–6 percent.
Inflation: Consumer price inflation slowed to 8.6 percent by end 2010, helped by tighter monetary policy
and slowing demand, after exceeding 20 percent in 2009. Over the medium term, with supportive fiscal
and monetary policies, inflation is expected to converge to the middle single digit range.
Government balances: Following the widening of the primary deficit to 4.4 percent of nonoil GDP in
2010, a balanced primary position is assumed over the long term. This reflects a significant increase in
revenue mobilization of up to 5 percent of GDP (partly due to oil production) as well as a small decline in
expenditures in relation to nonoil GDP over the medium-to-long term. Within the overall expenditure
budget, there is an assumed emphasis on growth-oriented infrastructure investments. Foreign grant
receipts are projected to fall significantly (relative to nonoil GDP) over the projection period as Ghana
benefits from oil income.
Current account balance: Ghana’s external balances have benefitted from strong cocoa and gold export
prices in recent years. In the medium-to-long term, the current account deficit is projected to narrow to
around 3–4 percent of GDP. Exports are projected to peak at 34–35 percent of GDP in 2011, boosted by
commodity exports. After that, declining oil exports are partly offset by rising non-mineral exports,
leaving exports at 30–31 percent of GDP over the medium-to-long term. Imports are projected to stabilize
around 35–36 percent of GDP, comprising equipments for new oil fields as well as projected government
infrastructure investment projects. The current account balance is projected at slightly under 4 percent of
GDP over the long term, broadly in line with the current account norm produced by the macroeconomic
balance approach.
Financing flows: In the capital account, non-debt creating inflows (largely comprising foreign direct
investment) averaged 6.3 percent of GDP in 2010, largely reflecting oil and gas sector investments. Under
the baseline which assumes that oil extraction is limited to the Jubilee 1 field, oil-related investments are
projected to decelerate, with foreign direct investment stabilizing at around to 3–4 percent of GDP over
the medium-to-long run, in line with the average for Sub-Saharan African countries. Official financing is
assumed to remain broadly stable at around 3 percent of GDP per annum, while financing is projected to
become increasingly non-concessional over the medium-to-long term, and is expected to represent 85–
90 percent of total official borrowing by the end of the projection period. The shift would be consistent
with Ghana’s improving wealth and lower middle-income status.
Commercial borrowing: The projected rise in commercial borrowing is more modest than in last year’s
DSA, and is consistent with Ghana’s prudent pace of external borrowing in 2010 (roughly 0.7 percent of
GDP) and its continuing intention to rely on concessional financing where possible (Text Table 4). Nonconcessional borrowing is projected to gradually rise as a share of external official financing and average
2 percent of GDP during 2016-30, compared to 3 percent of rebased GDP in the 2010 DSA. Furthermore,
the DSA assumes that the ECF program limits on contracting non-concessional external debt will be fully
utilized during 2011–12, leading to an upturn in commercial disbursements. There is some downside
potential to this assumption, given that the ECF borrowing limit was not fully utilized in 2011.

III. EXTERNAL DSA
Baseline scenario
7.
Under the baseline scenario, Ghana’s debt indicators are well below the relevant
indicative debt distress thresholds. The projected level and composition of external debt is
associated with only a small deterioration in the various debt burden indicators, with all
remaining well below their respective thresholds (Text Table 5, Tables 1 and 2, and
Figure 1).5 The baseline external debt burden trajectories are more favorable than in the 2010
DSA, reflecting the more conservative assumptions regarding external borrowing on nonconcessional terms (see last paragraph, Box 2) and rebased GDP data.6

5

These thresholds are applicable to public and publicly guaranteed (PPG) external debt. External debt stock is
measured on gross basis.
6

The peak in Figure 1 relates to the repayment of the 2007 sovereign bond. Non-concessional external
borrowing is assumed to have a ten-year maturity, with four years grace, and an average interest rate of
8 percent per annum.

Standard stress tests
8.
Standard stress tests show limited risks of debt distress as all indicators remain
well below their thresholds under most extreme scenarios. Keeping key variables at their
historical levels only increases debt burden indicators marginally.7 However, using historical
averages does not account for the impact of the start of oil production in 2010–11, which will
increase exports and GDP levels. A permanently higher nominal interest rate on new external
borrowing has a limited impact on debt burden indicators.8
9.
The bound tests show the effects of transitory shocks. In all cases, the debt burden
indicators remain well below their indicative thresholds. The strongest impact on the debt7

In the historical scenario, key variables kept at their 2001–10 levels are output growth, inflation (measured by
GDP deflator and valued at U.S. dollar terms), non-interest current account balance as a percent of GDP, and
non-debt creating external (FDI) financing flows.
8

The standard stress test assumes that the interest rate on new borrowing is two percentage points higher than in
the baseline scenario. Even with a larger increase of 4 percentage points, debt indicators remain well below the
indicative thresholds.

91
to-GDP, debt-to-revenue, and debt service-to-revenue ratios arises from a 30 percent
depreciation of the Ghanaian cedi in 2012. For the debt-to-exports and debt service-toexports ratios, a shock to net non-debt creating flows is most significant.
Customized stress tests
10.
A range of customized stress tests were conducted to assess Ghana’s resilience to
country-specific shocks. Ghana’s has become increasingly reliant on non-resident purchases
of domestic currency bonds, but the outstanding stock remains modest in relation to GDP. If
these debts were treated as foreign debts for assessment purposes, external debt and debt
service ratios would increase slightly, but overall debt sustainability would not be
significantly impacted. As noted above, significantly higher costs of external borrowing can
also be sustained without breaching the debt sustainability thresholds.
11.
An alternative scenario was developed to explore the implications of an increase
in commercial borrowing. It was assumed that external commercial borrowing would be
2 percent of GDP annually higher that in the baseline scenario (raising commercial
borrowing to 5 percent of GDP in 2031). Debt-to-GDP and debt-service ratios are projected
to increase significantly relative to the baseline, but remain below their relevant thresholds
(Text Table 6 on the following page). The less favorable debt indicators highlight the risks of
increased use of commercial borrowing, while suggesting some room for maneuver relative
to the baseline.
12.
Ghana is potentially vulnerable to higher than projected current account
deficits. This could reflect lower export revenues, higher import costs, or a deterioration in
the outlook for foreign direct investment. With a non-interest current account deficit
averaging 6.6 percent of GDP during 2017–31 (compared to a baseline projection of
3.0 percent of GDP, and a historic average of 4.2 percent of GDP), the larger financing needs
would lead to a steady rise in debt and debt service indicators toward the threshold levels by
the end of the projections period.
13.
These vulnerabilities could emerge if the assumed fiscal consolidation is not
achieved. A customized scenario has been developed to assess potential spillovers to
external debt sustainability from a serious shortfall in fiscal consolidation (see Table 2,
Customized scenario A3; and Figure 1). This scenario assumes that public sector finances
under-perform and lead to a deterioration in the non-oil fiscal balance. Higher spending is
projected to result in higher imports by 3 percentage points of GDP, which is sustained
through the projection period. The fiscal situation is further aggravated by the projected
shortfall in oil incomes associated with a halving in global oil prices. With lower public
saving, there will be a need for higher external financing, which would result in a steady

92
deterioration in debt- and debt service ratios (Figure 1, Customized scenario).9 In this
scenario, all debt indicators and the debt-service-to-revenue ratio would breach their
indicative thresholds, while the debt service-to-export ratio could stay below its indicative
threshold.

The scenario assumes that the external current account deficit would be 3 percent of GDP higher that in the
baseline. This results from a combination of lower export revenues (owing to lower global oil prices; net of oil
imports), and higher imports by the government.

93

IV. PUBLIC SECTOR DSA
Baseline scenario
14.
The baseline shows a slow increase in overall public debt relative to GDP over
the projection horizon. Until 2015, public debt-GDP ratio is projected to fall, benefitting
from primary fiscal surpluses in the next few years, and bottom out at 34 percent of GDP.10
With the fading of primary surpluses in the subsequent years, public debt ratios are projected
to gradually rise and the debt stock would reach 41 percent of GDP at the end of the
projection period (Text Table 7, Table 3 and 4, and Figure 2).11
15.
Debt service cost to revenues rises due to higher external borrowing at
commercial terms (Text Table 7). With the assumed increase in external borrowing at
commercial terms over the projection period, the average maturity of external debt would
become shorter (see para. 7) and the rollover of external debt would become more frequent.
The amortization of external public debt also increases as a share of total debt service costs
(reaching 70 percent by 2031, when a large portion of external borrowing is at commercial
terms).

10

Primary surplus is projected to reach 1.4 percent of GDP in 2013 and narrow during the subsequent years.
After 2018 the primary position is projected to remain broadly balanced (Table 3).

11

Public debt is measured on net basis. The accumulation of oil assets to the government, starting in 2011, will
reduce public sector debt to GDP ratios in Table 3.

16.
Fiscal consolidation is key to public debt sustainability. In the 2010 DSA, the
debt-to-GDP ratio was projected to decline during the forecast period, to about 25 percent of
rebased GDP. However, debt projections over a long duration are sensitive to variations in
the underlying macroeconomic assumptions.
17.
Overall public debt dynamics remain sensitive to assumptions regarding growth
and fiscal consolidation (Figure 2). Under the status quo scenario in which the primary
deficit remains at the projected 2011 levels totaling 1.3 percent of GDP (rather than shifting
to surplus until 2017 and remaining balanced thereafter), the debt-GDP ratio increases by
about 20 percent of GDP by 2031, relative to the baseline, to around 63 percent of GDP
(Table 4, test A2). Similarly, debt dynamics are sensitive to growth rates; a one-third of one
percentage point reduction in average growth over 2011–31 increases the projected debt-toGDP ratio by 12 percentage points by 2031 (Table 4, test A3).
18.
Although public debt levels are projected to increase over the coming decades,
growth in domestic savings will help meet these financing needs. Ghana’s financial
savings base is small relative to other lower middle-income countries but expanding steadily
(as measured, for example, by the M2-GDP ratio). Projected growth in domestic savings over
the projection period appears to be adequate to sustain higher levels of debt in relation to
GDP.
V. DEBT MANAGEMENT CAPACITY
19.
Improvements in debt management capacity are under way. Ghana’ policies and
institutions, as measured by the World Bank’s Country Policy and Institutional Assessment
(CPIA), averaged 3.89 over the period 2007–2009, placing it as a “strong performer.” Efforts
to strengthen Ghana’s debt management capacity include publication of a debt management
strategy in December 2010 together with improvements in analyzing alternative borrowing

95
options and their cost and risk implications in a coherent framework. Guidelines have also
been prepared and published to help in project selection and appraisal. Consistent with the
ECF program limits for nonconcessional borrowing, borrowing plans of the key state-owned
enterprises are being monitored closely. Better monitoring will also help to eliminate the data
gap related to SOEs debts . Furthermore, the debt management division has been reorganized
with units specialized by functional areas, and training is provided to staff on monitoring and
risk-management techniques. Plans are being prepared to monitor domestic debt flows more
closely.
VI. CONCLUSIONS
20.
The baseline DSA is more favorable than a year ago. The improvements in debt
burden trajectories reflect more moderate external borrowing assumptions as well as upward
revisions to the national accounts. As a result, the trajectories of all external debt burden
indicators remain well within their respective thresholds, while overall public debt ratios
increase only modestly over the projections period.
21.
Risks of debt distress are assessed to remain moderate, in line with the 2010
DSA. If the planned fiscal consolidation is achieved without a substantial further debt buildup, an improved rating of low risk of debt distress could be considered at a future date.
22.
Successful fiscal consolidation will be essential for achieving the projected debt
outcomes. The customized scenario highlights possible spillovers from deteriorating public
finances to the external sector that could lead to higher debt distress.
23.
Robust growth is also important. Without sustained strong growth, debt and debt
service ratios are likely to be higher as shown by some of the stress tests undertaken in the
context of public debt. This is an important consideration for the use of commercial financing
to fund new project investments. If these investments do not deliver a high economic return,
Ghana’s debt vulnerabilities could increase significantly.
24.
Continuing improvements should be sought also in debt management capacity.
Good progress made during 2010 should be carried forward in the periods ahead, particularly
given Ghana’s growing access to market financing. Although Ghana has some flexibility in
managing its borrowing at commercial terms, it will be essential that new debts are managed
carefully, including extending the maturity of external commercial debt so that the rollover of
this debt remains manageable.

Includes both public and private sector external debt.
Derived as [r - g - ρ(1+g)]/(1+g+ρ+gρ) times previous period debt ratio, with r = nominal interest rate; g = real GDP growth rate, and ρ = growth rate of GDP deflator in U.S. dollar terms.
Includes exceptional financing (i.e., changes in arrears and debt relief); changes in gross foreign assets; and valuation adjustments. For projections also includes contribution from price and exchange rate changes.
Assumes that PV of private sector debt is equivalent to its face value.
Current-year interest payments divided by previous period debt stock.
Historical averages and standard deviations are generally derived over the past 10 years, subject to data availability.
Defined as grants, concessional loans, and debt relief.
Grant-equivalent financing includes grants provided directly to the government and through new borrowing (difference between the face value and the PV of new debt).

Sources: Ghanaian authorities; and staff estimates and projections.

1/ Variables include real GDP growth, growth of GDP deflator (in U.S. dollar terms), non-interest current account in percent of GDP, and non-debt creating flows.
2/ Assumes that the interest rate on new borrowing is by 2 percentage points higher than in the baseline., while grace and maturity periods are the same as in the baseline.
3/ Exports values are assumed to remain permanently at the lower level, but the current account as a share of GDP is assumed to return to its baseline level after the shock
(implicitly assuming an offsetting adjustment in import levels).
4/ Includes official and private transfers and FDI.
5/ Depreciation is defined as percentage decline in dollar/local currency rate, such that it never exceeds 100 percent.
6/ Applies to all stress scenarios except for A2 (less favorable financing) in which the terms on all new financing are as specified in footnote 2.

IX. Safeguards Assessment
Under the Fund's safeguards assessment policy, the Bank of Ghana (BoG) has been subject to
an update assessment with respect to a new PRGF arrangement approved July 15, 2009; the
assessment, completed on December 2, 2009, followed an initial safeguards assessment from
2

Assistance committed under the original framework is expressed in net present value (NPV) terms at the
completion point, and assistance committed under the enhanced framework is expressed in NPV terms at the
decision point. Hence these two amounts ca not be added.
3

Under the enhanced framework, an additional disbursement is made at the completion point corresponding to
interest income earned on the amount committed at the decision point but not disbursed during the interim
period.
4

The MDRI provides 100 percent debt relief to eligible member countries that qualified for the assistance.
Grant assistance from the MDRI Trust and HIPC resources provide debt relief to cover the full stock of debt
owed to the Fund as of end-2004 that remains outstanding at the time the member qualifies for such debt relief.

106
October 2003. The update assessment found that while the safeguards framework of the BoG
has been strengthened in several areas since then, new risks in governance oversight emerged
with the removal of the former Board in January 2009, and a delay, due to a legal challenge,
in the start of the successor Board. Pending the resumption of Board activities some interim
measures have been introduced to provide an independent oversight mechanism. These
include the introduction of an Advisory Panel comprised of three outside members
responsible for the external and internal audit and controls systems. In March 2010, the
authorities have advised staff that a new Board has been appointed. They have also either
committed to or implemented all measures proposed by staff.
X. Exchange Rate Arrangement
On February 2, 1994, Ghana accepted obligations under Article VIII, Sections 2(a), 3, and 4,
of the Fund’s Articles of Agreement. The exchange rate regime is classified as a managed
float with no pre-determined path. The system is free of restrictions on payments and
transfers for current international transactions. At the end of March 2011, the average
exchange rate for transactions in the interbank market was GH¢1.50 per U.S. dollar.
XI. Article IV Consultation
The 2009 Article IV consultation discussions were held in Accra during May 11–22, 2009.
The staff report (Country Report No. 09/256) was discussed by the Executive Board on
July 15, 2009 and is posted on the IMF website.

Ghana participated in the FSAP in 2000–01. FSAP update was completed in December 2003

APPENDIX III. GHANA: STATISTICAL ISSUES
I. Assessment of Data Adequacy for Surveillance
General: Data provision has some shortcomings, but is broadly adequate for surveillance.
The quality and timeliness of certain data need to be improved. There are notable
deficiencies in the dissemination of statistical information to the public, although the
situation has improved recently with the publication on the Bank of Ghana’s (BOG) website
of the Monetary Policy Committee Statement, Statistical Releases, and monthly monetary
series for 2001–10.
National Accounts: The IMF’s Statistics Department (STA) has provided TA on national
accounts (NA) since 2001. A “bundled” TA mission visited Accra during March 12–26,
2008, with a follow-up mission in February 2009. The main objectives of these missions
were to assist the Ghana Statistical Service (GSS) in (a) developing a plan to adopt the
System of National Accounts 1993 (1993 SNA); (b) rebasing the national accounts—currently
dating from 1993; and (c) ensuring that plans are in place for a comprehensive data collection
program to improve the source data.
Improving the source data by creating a statistical system built on a regular survey program
is a priority for increasing accuracy and reliability. In this regard the following areas require
action: (i) design and building a business register that has a minimum of information on
output values, if possible input values, and the number of employees. The 2003 National
Industrial Census 2004/2 (NIC) serves as a good starting point, but must be maintained and
extended to also cover service industries; (ii) create a national statistical system containing
regular business surveys for manufacturing, construction, transport and communication, and
other service industries (surveys on retail trade and NPISH are urgently needed); (iii) create a
system for annual household surveys that is less comprehensive than the current Living
Standards Survey (round 5) 2005/06 (GLSS) which could be carried out on a more frequent
basis; and (iv) carry out an agricultural census.
The February 2009 mission also pointed out some minor areas where changes to the
estimates should be undertaken. There are still some concepts and methods that need to be
addressed to insure compliance with the 1993 SNA. Incorporation of new data sources and
rebasing of the national accounts to 2006, led to a significant upward revision of estimates of
GDP, which were published in November 2010.
Ghana is one of the countries participating in the National Accounts Module of the Enhanced
Data Dissemination Initiative (EDDI) supported by the United Kingdom Department for
International Development (DFID). The first mission under this project, which aims to
develop and improve quarterly national accounts estimates, took place in September 2010.
The mission reviewed existing methodology, made recommendations for methodological
improvements to and provided training on the quarterly national accounts. It is expected that
quarterly estimates in current prices and volume terms based on the new annual estimates
will be published in October 2011.

Labor statistics: The scarcity of labor statistics is a cause for concern. Labor statistics are
almost nonexistent, although some wage indicators are available from the Social Security
National Insurance Trust (SSNIT). The Ministry of Employment has been receiving technical
assistance from the United Nations Development Program and the International Labor
Organization in the design and compilation of labor statistics.
Government finance statistics: Steps have been taken to improve fiscal data. The Controller
Accountant General Department (CAGD) currently compiles monthly budget
implementation reports, and the data are available within six weeks, although some factors
undermine their reliability. There is a need for comprehensive and timely reconciliation of
monthly treasury data with bank accounts. To address these shortcomings, the government
has formed a committee to define the nature of “broad” and “narrow” government; moved to
a system of immediate booking for “direct debits” and more frequent reporting of
government account balances; and is implementing a new automated Budget and Public
Expenditure Management System (BPEMS). The BPEMS covers ministries, departments,
and agencies. Several GFS missions worked with the authorities to improve the economic
classification of data in accordance with the requirements of GFSM 2001. In 2009, an STA
mission also provided guidance on the compilation of a partial financial balance sheet for
budgetary central government, and proposed that information on debt stocks that is available
on a monthly basis be reported for the inclusion in the International Financial Statistics
(IFS).
The coverage of transactions is uneven. There are also difficulties in accounting for expenses
paid by extrabudgetary funds. The operations of special funds, such as the SSNIT (currently
regarded as a public financial corporation by the authorities), the Ghana Education Trust
Fund (GETF) and the District Assemblies Common Fund (DACF), are not yet covered in the
fiscal accounts. Although the majority of local government expenses are directly met from
budgetary accounts, the revenue of local governments and related spending, and transactions
financed from the DACF are not yet covered. Extending the coverage of fiscal data to general
government is strongly encouraged.
Comprehensive solutions to some of the data problems may have to await full
implementation of the BPEMS system and incorporation of Fund technical advice. Various
missions from FAD have suggested short-term temporary solutions to alleviate current data
quality problems.
Monetary and financial statistics: While BOG had made significant progress on
implementing the previous missions’ recommendations on monetary and financial statistics,
continued efforts are needed to improve the methodological soundness of the data.
The April-May 2009 mission concluded that the implementation of earlier advice was
uneven. While substantial progress was made in strengthening the source data for the BOG
and expanding institutional coverage of the ODCs to include rural banks and savings and
loans companies, the progress in improving data collection and compilation from the OFCs

112
had been slow. To enhance coordination among financial regulatory agencies and improve
data collection on the OFCs, the authorities agreed to establish an inter-agency committee.
The mission helped the BOG to implement the SRFs and expand the institutional coverage
(see above).
Debt statistics: The responsibility for external debt recording and payment is divided among
three agencies. The Ministry of Finance and Economic Planning (MOFEP), through its Aid
and Debt Management Unit (ADMU), maintains the external debt database. It is responsible
for recording debt payment obligations, issuing payment requests, and tracking HIPC debt
relief. The CAGD confirms the legality of the payment and authorizes the release of public
funds. It is responsible for accounting for debt payments and rendering reports to parliament.
The BOG as the payment agent for the government verifies payments made to ADMU and
CAGD.
To enable systematic comparison of the budget, the balance of payments and the BOG cashflow data, the authorities should clearly identify the government subsectors for which data
are reported and prepare a clear classification of financing, outstanding debt, and guarantees
issued.
Balance of payments Statistics: The Balance of Payments Office (BPO) of the Research
Department of the BOG is responsible for the compilation and dissemination of balance of
payments data for Ghana. Ghana participates in the external sector module of EDDI. and has
benefited extensively from technical assistance in developing and undertaking enterprise
surveys of cross-border financial flows and stocks (Foreign Private Capital Flows (FPCF)
surveys) with a view to improve the quality of balance of payments statistics and develop IIP
statistics.
In May 2010, an STA mission complemented the EDDI efforts by undertaking a
comprehensive assessment of institutional arrangements, data sources, methodology,
compilation, and dissemination practices for the overall BOP statistics, and advising on areas
for further improvement. The mission also provided technical advice on the compilation of
IIP statistics. Despite the progress achieved in improving the data sources and compilation
techniques, substantial work is still needed to (i) strengthen existing, and develop new data
sources to improve the accuracy and reliability of the current and capital account, and (ii)
achieve an adequate use of the existing data sources for the financial account. The mission
urged the BPO to work towards closing major remaining data gaps by making the
International Transactions Reporting System (ITRS) a reliable data source to the extent
possible, and use it, for the time being, at its full potential and as a cost-efficient way to
receive information for the current, capital, and financial account. With the results of the
FPCF, the BPO, in principle, has all building blocks available for compiling IIP statistics.
The next mission will take place in FY 2012.

113

Trade statistics
Currently, the GSS is not publishing timely monthly trade statistics, although the data are
available from the Customs, Excise, and Preventive Service (CEPS). The staff has
recommended that the GSS collaborate with the CEPS to process customs data within six
weeks and with the Ministry of Trade and Industry (MOT) and the BOG to identify and
reduce discrepancies in trade statistics and to ensure that imports into bonded warehouses are
not double-counted. Data collection procedures of the CEPS need to be improved, and there
is also room for improving trade volume data collected by the CEPS through customs
invoices, which would help the GSS to extract meaningful import and export unit values. The
May 2010 STA mission found that BPO treats goods that are temporarily imported into
Ghana without passing the customs authorities (i.e. not yet captured by customs) and then
sold to enterprises in the free zone as exports. This treatment would imply that free trade
zones are treated as located outside the Ghanaian economic territory, which should not be the
case.
Fund staff has recommended that the GSS produce export unit values for major export
commodities, such as gold and cocoa. A high coverage of the country’s export bundle can be
obtained from just three major exports—cocoa, gold, and unwrought aluminum. In contrast,
deflation of imports is likely to require an iterative procedure to strike a balance between
coverage of the index and its stability, owing to the heterogeneity of the basket.

III. Reporting to STA (Optional)
STA found some major issues in the March 2010 data for the Central Bank and the February
2010 data for the ODCs that the authorities submitted in April 2010 for publication in the
IFS. For this reason, STA thoroughly reviewed the entire mapping of source data to the SRFs
and several misclassifications were fixed. As a result, the updating of the IFS page for Ghana
was resumed in March 2011 after a long delay. The latest data published in the IFS are for
December 2010. Data for publication in the IFS on international transactions were last
reported for 2009, quarterly government finances for March 2010, and national accounts for
1997. No quarterly balance of payments data are currently reported for publication in the IFS.
The latest available data reported for publication in the Government Finance Statistics
Yearbook (GFSY) are for 2009. However, these data cover only the cash revenue and expense
transactions of the budgetary central government.

IMF Executive Board Concludes Article IV Consultation with Ghana
On May 25, 2011, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF)
concluded the Article IV consultation with Ghana.1
Background
Ghana’s economy grew by 7.7 percent in 2010, after a temporary slowdown in 2009,
reflecting continued buoyancy of commodity exports as well as stronger construction
and service sector activities. Spillovers from instability in Côte d’Ivoire have been limited.
The rebasing of Ghana’s national accounts in 2010 showed the country as having a
higher income level and growing faster than earlier recorded. With an upward revision to
per capita incomes of about 70 percent, Ghana moved into the lower-middle income
country grouping.
The fiscal deficit rose to 7.7 percent of GDP in 2010, compared to 5.8 percent of GDP in
2009. While tax revenue collections were broadly in line with the budget, non-tax
revenues and grants fell short of targets and capital spending was larger than
anticipated. Spending commitments discovered in 2010 also led to the accumulation of
payment arrears, equivalent to 1.9 percent of GDP. The combined fiscal slippage in
1

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies.
On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion
by the Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as
Chairman of the Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is
transmitted to the country's authorities. An explanation of any qualifiers used in summings
up can be found here: http://www.imf.org/external/np/sec/misc/qualifiers.htm.

117
relation to the 2010 program, taking into account both cash transactions (the fiscal
deficit) and unpaid bills (arrears), was equivalent to 2.6 percent of GDP.
External performance was strong in 2010. Exports grew by $2 billion, with cocoa and
gold benefiting from high global prices. While imports staged a strong recovery after a
decline in 2009, the current account deficit of 7.2 percent of GDP in 2010 was more than
financed by strong capital inflows, including direct investments in the oil sector and
Treasury bond purchases by nonresidents. Gross reserve cover rose to 3.2 months of
import cover at end-2010.
Reflecting the strong balance of payments, the cedi has traded in a relatively narrow
range against the U.S. dollar since mid-2009. This currency stability, combined with the
lagged effects of earlier monetary tightening, contributed to a decline in inflation from
around 20 percent in 2009 to close to 9 percent since mid-2010. Favorable harvests
have sheltered Ghana from rising global food prices so far.
The Bank of Ghana’s policy interest rate which had been kept at 13.5 percent since July
2010 was reduced by 50 basis points in May, reflecting the stability of inflation in recent
months, the continuing strength of the cedi, and a slight slowing of credit growth in early
2011. Despite a partial sterilization of Ghana’s balance of payments surpluses, reserve
money grew by 35 percent in 2010 and broad money by 46 percent, considerably more
rapidly than in 2009. Private sector credit also picked up towards end-2010.
The mid-2010 Financial Sector Assessment Program (FSAP) Update found that
financial stability risks have heightened since the 2003 FSAP. While, in the aggregate,
the banking system is profitable and liquid with high capital levels, nonperforming loan
ratios are elevated, in part due to government payment arrears. Risks also relate to
extensive state involvement in the banking sector, shortcomings in commercial banks’
risk management and accounting practices, gaps in supervision and systemic risk
analysis, and weak enforcement of creditor rights. Immediate stability risks have been
reduced since mid-2010 by clearance of substantial government arrears and state
enterprise debts. The incidence of bank undercapitalization has also declined, with
banks raising capital or merging with stronger banks, and progress has been made in
strengthening regulation and supervision. Nevertheless, key sources of vulnerabilities
remain and a sustained and comprehensive reform effort is needed to achieve long term
financial stability.

118

Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors welcomed Ghana’s strong growth and favorable medium-term
outlook, underpinned by high commodity export prices, the start of oil production, and
strong non-oil activity. International reserves have increased, the currency remains
stable, and inflation has declined to single digits. To maintain the growth momentum and
to meet the country’s development objectives, Directors stressed the need to address
Ghana’s fiscal vulnerabilities and further advance the structural reform agenda.
Directors regretted that fiscal consolidation goals were not achieved in 2010, reflecting
in part the delays in fiscal reforms. Going forward, they emphasized the importance of
stronger fiscal management and called for rigorous implementation of the authorities’
plan to reduce the cash deficit and avoid further domestic arrears. They highlighted that
this would require improved expenditure control, a prudent roll out of the new pay
structure, and determined efforts to boost tax collections in relation to GDP. Directors
urged the authorities to take additional measures to strengthen the budget, should the
need arise.
Directors stressed the importance of maintaining the momentum of structural fiscal
reforms, notably for tax administration, payroll management, and expenditure control.
While welcoming the improvement in Ghana’s debt sustainability outlook, they
underscored the need for continued improvements in debt management and prudent
borrowing strategies.
Directors welcomed the recent approval of an oil revenue management bill, as well as
the authorities’ intention to ensure that oil-related incomes, expenditures and savings be
transparently and comprehensively recorded for dissemination, analysis, and audit
purposes.
Directors observed that cost-recovery pricing of energy products is crucial for sound
fiscal management. They welcomed the recent sizable adjustment of domestic
petroleum product prices and encouraged the authorities to closely monitor
developments in this area to ensure that domestic prices remain in line with market
trends. Directors welcomed the move to quarterly cost-based reviews of electricity
tariffs.
Directors concurred that monetary policy implementation should remain alert to
inflationary pressures. Should circumstances warrant, the Bank of Ghana (BoG) should
stand ready to tighten policies in support of the inflation target. Directors noted the
assessment that the exchange rate is broadly in line with fundamentals, and welcomed
the authorities’ intention to sustain this through a flexible exchange rate regime. They
supported the BoG’s plans to further strengthen its monitoring of the balance of
payments as well as its tools and policies for foreign exchange market intervention.

119

Directors noted that banks are profitable and liquid with high capital. They welcomed the
steps taken by the authorities to address stability risks in the banking sector identified by
the recent Financial Stability Assessment Program Update. They agreed that stronger
measures will be necessary to tackle the elevated non performing loans. Further
progress needs to be made to resolve vulnerable institutions, strengthen risk
management in banks, enhance banking supervision, and enforce prudential regulation.

Public Information Notices (PINs) form part of the IMF's efforts to promote transparency of the IMF's
views and analysis of economic developments and policies. With the consent of the country
(or countries) concerned, PINs are issued after Executive Board discussions of Article IV consultations
with member countries, of its surveillance of developments at the regional level, of post-program
monitoring, and of ex post assessments of member countries with longer-term program engagements.
PINs are also issued after Executive Board discussions of general policy matters, unless otherwise
decided by the Executive Board in a particular case.

IMF Executive Board Completes Third and Fourth Reviews Under ECF Arrangement
with Ghana and Approves US$94.3 Million Disbursement
The Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) completed on May 25 the
third and fourth reviews of Ghana’s performance under the economic program supported by
the Extended Credit Facility (ECF). The completion of the reviews will enable an immediate
disbursement of an amount equivalent to SDR 59.58 million (about US$94.3 million),
bringing total disbursements under the arrangement to SDR 208.73million (about US$330.3
million).
In completing the reviews, the Board also approved a waiver for the non-observance of the
end-December 2010 performance criteria on the overall fiscal deficit and on the net change in
the stock of domestic arrears. The Board also approved a rephasing of disbursements.
The three-year ECF arrangement was approved on July 15, 2009, with access of SDR 387.45
million (about US$613.1 million or 105 percent of quota).
Following the Executive Board’s discussion on Ghana, Mr. Naoyuki Shinohara, Deputy
Managing Director and Acting Chair issued the following statement:
“Ghana’s economy rebounded in 2010, with strong growth and external performance.
International reserves increased, the currency remained broadly stable, and inflation declined
to single digits. Fiscal performance, however, deteriorated with a rise in the cash deficit and
accumulation of domestic arrears.
“The authorities’ 2011 economic program focuses appropriately on restoring the momentum
of fiscal consolidation. The budget target for this year is ambitious and will require that a
portion of Ghana’s initial oil production revenues be saved. Contingencies identified by the
authorities will be important to ensure that the 2011 fiscal goals can be achieved.

122
“Structural fiscal reforms should be accelerated. Priorities are to reinforce tax administration
under a revamped Ghana Revenue Authority, strengthen expenditure monitoring and control
including through a new budget management system, and regularize Ghana’s domestic
payments arrears. Adopting transparent procedures for oil revenue management, as stipulated
in the Petroleum Management Act, will also be important.
“The adoption of quarterly electricity tariff reviews is an important step towards addressing
risks to the budget from energy pricing. For domestic petroleum products, it will be
important to avoid losses to the budget when protection provided by hedging ends.
“Ghana faces inflation risks from rising global commodity prices, robust domestic growth,
and rapid liquidity expansion. The Bank of Ghana should stand ready to tighten monetary
conditions, as needed. A further build up in reserve cover would be appropriate within a
flexible exchange rate regime.
“Steps have been taken to address immediate vulnerabilities in the banking system. However,
further steps are needed to review the appropriate extent of state involvement in the banking
industry, strengthen risk management by banks, enhance supervisory capacity, enforce
prudential regulations, and strengthen corporate governance, accounting standards, and
creditor rights,” Mr. Shinohara said.

123

Statement by Jafar Mojarrad, Executive Director for Ghana
and Alberta Hagan, Alternate Executive Director
May 25, 2011

We would like to convey the Ghanaian authorities’ gratitude to the Executive Board and
management for their continued support. Our authorities also express appreciation to the staff
team headed by Mr. Peter Allum for the candid and constructive dialogue under the threeyear Extended Credit Facility and during the Article IV discussions. They also thank the IMF
and World Bank staffs for the useful FSAP Update.
Ghana’s performance improved in 2010. Growth has rebounded, driven by high
commodity exports, good rainfalls, and sustained non-oil activity. Revised estimates by the
Ghana Statistical Service show economic growth of 7.7 percent in 2010. Inflation continually
declined from 20.7 percent in June 2009 to 8.6 percent at end-December 2010. Developments
in the external sector were also favorable, with exports growing by more than a third, the
current account deficit being financed mainly by foreign direct investment and official capital
flows, reserves increasing significantly to the equivalent of 3.2 months of imports, and the
currency stabilizing, reflecting business confidence.
The authorities are resolutely implementing the ECF-supported program, carrying out
challenging reforms and promptly taking corrective actions in few areas where progress has
been slower than expected. All performance criteria for end-June and end-December 2010
were met, except those for the overall fiscal deficit, which was missed by a small margin, and
the stock of domestic arrears at end-December. Structural reform implementation was
satisfactory in many areas, as outlined in the Memorandum of Economic and Financial
Policies (MEFP). The authorities request waivers of the missed performance criteria and
completion of the third and fourth reviews under the ECF.
Ghana’s growth story has changed dramatically. The rebasing of national accounts in
2010 revealed that overall growth and per capita income were growing much faster than
estimated earlier, thereby moving Ghana to a lower-middle income country status, with per
capita GDP estimated at US$1343 in 2010. Oil production began in late 2010, at about
40,000 bpd, and is expected to peak at about 115,000 bpd by August this year. Together with
continued strength of non-oil activity, real GDP growth is projected to accelerate to
14 percent in 2011 and to average close to 8.0 percent a year in 2012-13, which should place
the economy on a higher growth trajectory while achieving the MDGs—the overarching goal
of the Ghana Shared Growth and Development Agenda, 2010–13.

Fiscal Policy
Despite some spending overruns, the cash fiscal deficit in 2010 was missed by only a
small margin (0.8 percent of GDP), as a result of the corrective measures taken by the
authorities. Moreover, the revenue from the sale of gold company shares (0.7 percent of

124
GDP), which was planned for end-December 2010, slipped into January 2011. Had this
operation taken place as planned, the fiscal target would have been missed by less than
0.2 percent of GDP. However, while outstanding arrears as of end-2009 were partially settled
in 2010, new arrears, mainly linked to a surge in spending commitments during 2007-08,
were identified in 2010, so that the stock of arrears increased instead of declining. Domestic
borrowing also exceeded the program indicative target, reflecting a delay in a World Bank
loan disbursement
Looking forward, fiscal consolidation remains a top priority. While the program’s
targeted fiscal correction of 5 percentage points of GDP in 2011 (on a commitment basis) is
very ambitious by any standard, especially given Ghana’s sustainable debt position, the
authorities are determined to achieve this target and to reduce the deficit further to 2½ 3 percent of GDP in 2012-13, regularize all arrears, and use part of oil revenue to build fiscal
savings. In doing so, they will place greater weight on revenue mobilization and expenditure
control while preserving growth-enhancing spending on infrastructure and social programs.
The March 2011 fiscal outturn is indicative of the good progress being made in fiscal
consolidation, including in reducing domestic arrears.
The 2011 Budget features strong revenue measures, and additional measures are being
developed. These include, in particular, raising the withholding tax rate and threshold,
extending the communication service tax to the entire industry, raising the airport and vehicle
income tax rates, and extending the national stabilization levy through 2011. The Budget also
introduces monthly rather than quarterly payments of mining royalties, discontinues the
practice of two-year warehousing of imports before taxation and of deferred payments of
VAT, and reduces the scope for tax exemptions. Additional tax measures are being
developed, including imposing VAT on fee-based services of banks and other financial
institutions and on the sale of new properties by estate development firms; raising property
tax rates; and negotiating more beneficial agreements with mining companies.
The authorities are also strengthening revenue administration, as highlighted in the
MEFP. Progress is being made with setting up the Ghana Revenue Authority (GRA) as an
integrated revenue authority; the Large Taxpayer Office is being restructured in line with
Fund TA recommendations; and the VAT threshold has been raised and a flat 3 percent VAT
rate established for the 20,000 taxpayers that fall below the new threshold.
The recently-approved Petroleum Revenue Management Act provides a transparent
framework for the collection, allocation, and management of petroleum revenue for the
benefit of all Ghanaians. The Act provides for the opening of a Petroleum Holding Fund—a
transit account at the central bank—to receive all upstream petroleum revenues which will be
used in part for budget support, and the remainder saved in two accounts, one for smoothing
expenditures in the face of shocks, and the other as an endowment for future generations.
The authorities, including at the highest level, have reaffirmed their strong commitment
to enhance expenditure management and control. Wide ranging measures will be
deployed to this effect, as detailed in the MEFP, encompassing reform of the budget process,
upgrading the computerization and infrastructure of expenditure management and control,

125
and strengthening cash management. In addition, a new public service pay policy, the single
spine pay, has been adopted to help streamline the public sector payroll. So far, 60 percent of
public service employees have been migrated onto the new system, with the remainder to be
migrated in line with budget appropriations.
The authorities recognize the challenges associated with arrears accumulation, which
complicates fiscal management and poses risks to the banking sector. They are committed to
arrears control and elimination and are developing a comprehensive strategy to address the
issue. This strategy includes developing an elaborate database to capture government
contractual obligations; ascertain the validity of claims and potential liabilities of state owned
enterprises (SOEs); and regularize arrears through cash payments and the issue of special
purpose bonds in line with the program targets. Moreover, ongoing measures to prevent
arrears accumulation include strengthening planning and expenditure controls (for example,
all spending units are required to obtain commencement certificates from the Ministry of
Finance before embarking upon any capital spending), monthly monitoring of arrears, and
improved cash management. The authorities intend to draw on the recommendations of the
recent Fund TA in implementing their strategy. They have accelerated arrears payment, and
by end-March this year, a substantial part of the arrears owed to contractors and statutory
funds were settled.

Monetary, Exchange Rate, and Financial Sector Policies
The primary objective of monetary policy remains price stability. Inflation-targeting
continues to be the main framework for monetary policy, with liquidity management
implemented using market-based instruments. Substantial gains have been made in
containing inflation. However, the authorities are aware of potential risks stemming from the
strong balance of payments position and buoyant domestic activity. Thus, they remain
vigilant and stand ready to take preemptive measures using the full range of monetary policy
instruments to curb inflationary pressures, as needed, while mindful of the growth objective.
The authorities’ remain committed to a floating exchange rate regime and are attentive
to current account sustainability and competitiveness. They consider external
competitiveness important in light of the start of oil production and increased investor
interest which could stoke appreciation pressures and hurt non-oil exports and domestic
production. While agreeing with staff assessment that the valuation of Ghana’s currency is
broadly in line with fundamentals, they are also of the view that addressing non-price factors
is key to strengthening competitiveness. They will continue to build foreign reserves as a
buffer against external shocks.
The FSSA recognizes the significant development of Ghana’s financial system and the
important progress made by the authorities in strengthening regulatory and
supervisory framework and financial infrastructures, with the aim of enhancing
financial stability. It also finds that the banking sector is liquid, profitable, and highly
capitalized. The authorities share many of the conclusions of the FSAP Update, even though
they do not share staff’s assessment that all state banks perform poorly. This

126
notwithstanding, they have made significant progress in implementing the recommendations
and have incorporated them into their comprehensive reform program.
The authorities remain strongly committed to strengthen supervision and closely
engaged with banks to increase banking sector resilience and further reduce NPLs. In
addition to measures taken to enhance capacity of the Supervision Department of the BOG,
and to enable timely assessment of the industry as a whole, consolidated monthly banking
industry reports and quarterly financial stability reports are being prepared. Furthermore, the
authorities undertake bimonthly stress testing of the banking industry while banks are
required to do same monthly. A Financial Stability Department to provide supportive
systemic risk analysis has been established. The AML/CFT framework is being strengthened
following the establishment of the Financial Intelligence Center and the Anti-Money
Laundering Office.
The setting up of asset recovery companies, increased use of Commercial and Fast Track
courts, more rigorous monitoring of loan portfolios, and intensified supervision are helping
lower NPLs, even though the impact of these measures will take time. Measures being taken
to reduce banks’ exposure to SOEs and settle government arrears have reduced associated
risks. In addition, good progress has been made towards bridging gaps in bank resolution and
crisis management frameworks, in cross-border supervision, as well as in improving banks’
corporate governance and risk management. The authorities will consider carefully available
options for establishing a deposit insurance scheme in line with best international practices.

Debt Sustainability and Competitiveness
Our authorities’ affirmed commitment to fiscal consolidation, their determination to observe
the program limits on nonconcessional borrowing and restrict such borrowing to highpriority and high-return projects, together with continued prudent public debt management
would preserve public debt sustainability. To this end, the recent restructuring of Tema Oil
Refinery and the clearing of its outstanding liability through public debt issuance has reduced
this source of contingent liabilities.
Our authorities are also forging ahead with structural reforms aimed at improving the
economy’s competitiveness. The reforms target enhancing institutional capacity and market
efficiency, accelerating procedures for business starting and closing and tax filing, and
further deepening the financial system. The reforms are also directed towards infrastructure
development, raising the quality of education and the quantum of highly trained manpower,
as well as improving access to technology.

Conclusion
After a temporary economic slowdown in 2009 and the unanticipated cost of the political
conflicts in Côte d’Ivoire and Libya, which has been well managed, our Ghanaian authorities
are moving ahead with their development agenda. The main focus of this agenda is to expand
opportunities for inclusive long-term growth and poverty reduction, through prudent

127
macroeconomic policies supported by structural reforms. Our authorities value their
engagement with the Fund in their quest for prosperity, and are grateful for continued Fund
support.
