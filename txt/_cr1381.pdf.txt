STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2013 ARTICLE IV CONSULTATION
March 7, 2013

KEY ISSUES
Outlook and risks. Significant macroeconomic rebalancing has taken place since the
2008–09 crisis and the recovery is well underway. But growth is expected to moderate to
3 percent in 2013 (from 3.6 percent in 2012), as the effects of a bumper harvest unwind.
Over the medium term, growth should gradually rise toward its potential of around
3¾ percent, but this hinges on a recovery in investment. Risks have moderated, but remain
on the downside as renewed financial stress or weak growth in Europe would adversely
affect Lithuania.
Fiscal policy. The fiscal deficit has declined significantly, from 9½ percent of GDP in 2009 to
an estimated 3 percent of GDP in 2012. The 2013 budget—with a deficit target of
2½ percent of GDP—appropriately balances supporting the recovery with the need for
further consolidation. Going forward, further fiscal consolidation is needed to fully rebuild
fiscal space. But, the composition of adjustment should shift to the revenue side, given
Lithuania’s low revenue-to-GDP ratio and substantial scope to increase wealth taxation.
Financial stability. The mostly foreign-owned banking system is, overall, well-capitalized
and liquid, but weaknesses in some domestically-owned banks had to be forcefully
addressed. The Bank of Lithuania’s intervention of two domestically-owned banks and two
credit unions underscores the importance of effective supervision.
Credit growth. The financial sector has an essential role to play in enabling sound credit
expansion to support economic growth. While a balanced approach to credit policies is
clearly important to avoid the excesses of the boom years, adequate credit expansion is
needed to support investment. Reducing obstacles to the resolution of non-performing
loans could help ease constraints on credit supply.
Competitiveness. Reaching potential growth will require that competitiveness gains since
the crisis are preserved. Going forward, it will be critical to boost investment through
improvements in the business climate and to address challenges in the labor market
through training and active labor market policies.
Political situation. A new government took office in late 2012 and has advocated greater
social inclusion, job creation, higher pensions and wages, and enhanced tax progressivity.

ratio has dropped markedly.
GDP per capita has recovered to its pre-crisis peak, although Lithuania’s shrinking population also
contributed to this.
2.
The main policy challenge is to complete the adjustment to secure robust and
sustainable growth. With the unemployment rate still high (albeit much lower than its peak level),
sustaining growth will be essential for job creation, which would help stem outward migration,
especially of young and highly skilled labor. Meanwhile, the fiscal deficit and public debt still need to
be further reduced to create space for fiscal policy to play its countercyclical role going forward. In
the banking sector, nonperforming loans (NPLs)—a legacy of the crisis—have contributed to
cautious lending. Going forward, boosting credit growth will be especially important as a rebound in
investment is needed to sustain the recovery and preserve competitiveness.
3.
A new government took office in late 2012. The authorities are still in the process of fully
articulating their policy agenda, but the government program stresses social inclusion, job creation,
higher pensions and wages, and greater tax progressivity. The government has publicly announced
its goal to adopt the euro in 2015. Lithuania will hold the EU presidency in the second half of 2013.

Labor market conditions continued to improve. The unemployment rate fell to

exports, which were further boosted by a bumper harvest (the harvest is estimated to have
contributed about ¼ percentage point of GDP growth). Lingering uncertainty about the external and
domestic environments kept investment low. As a result, capacity utilization is now above its
long-term average.

6.
Inflation declined as the effects of rising global commodity prices moderated. The
pass-through of higher food and energy prices continued in 2012, notably with a large increase in
the heating price in July 2012. But this effect waned in the second half of the year, and energy
prices even fell in late 2012. As a result, average inflation dropped from 4.1 percent in 2011 to
3.2 percent in 2012. Core inflation remained fairly subdued at 2 percent at end-2012.
7.

The external position has improved, but debt remains high and reserve coverage low.



The trade balance turned positive and the current account improved. Strong exports, a
bumper harvest, and an improvement in the terms of trade—lower oil prices and high cereals
prices—turned the trade balance (goods and services) slightly positive in 2012, from a deficit of
2.6 percent of GDP in 2011. This reduced the current account deficit, which was broadly offset by
lower FDI (the highly profitable manufacturing sector paid out dividends rather than fully
reinvest profits), lower net portfolio inflows, and repayments of parent bank loans in the first half
of 2012. 1 The latter reflects the migration of deposits (about 3½ percent of GDP) from the
intervened Snoras bank to foreign-owned banks, which used the extra funding to repay parent
loans (Annex I, ¶10 and ¶22).



The real effective exchange rate is estimated to be broadly in line with fundamentals. The
CGER results are based on the CPI, while manufacturing ULCs have risen more moderately.

1

Data and methodological improvements led to an upward revision in the current account deficit for 2009–10 of
about 1 percentage point on average, implying that the external adjustment was initially slightly weaker, but this was
fully financed through revisions in the financial account without materially affecting gross external debt or the IIP.



External debt remains high and reserve coverage is low. Reserves at end-2012 (€6.5 billion)
were about 3 months of imports, 60 percent of short term external debt, and about €1.9 billion
below the new reserve adequacy metric. Gross external debt (72 percent of GDP) and net
international investment liabilities (48 percent of GDP) are still high, reflecting still significant
parent bank loans and foreign-held government debt, as well as the importance of net inward
FDI. The debt sustainability analysis suggests that external debt is sensitive to current account
and growth shocks.

8.
Financial market conditions have been favorable. The government successfully issued
about €1¾ billion in Eurobonds in 2012 and a 5-year €0.4 billion Eurobond at a yield of 2.6 percent
in early 2013. Five year sovereign CDS spreads reached post-crisis lows, at about 100 bps.

B. The Banking System
9.
The largely foreign-owned banking system is, overall, well capitalized and liquid.
Banks’ capital was further strengthened in 2012 as dividends were not paid out: regulatory capital to
risk-weighted assets improved from 13.9 percent at end-2011 to 14.2 percent at end-2012. The
banking sector’s liquidity ratio stood at 40.4 percent, well above the regulatory minimum
(30 percent). Preliminary calculations by the Bank of Lithuania (BoL) indicate that banks are
compliant with future Basel III requirements, with the Tier 1 capital ratio at 11.5 percent, leverage
ratio at 8.6 percent, liquidity coverage ratio at 192 percent, and net stable funding ratio at
161 percent. NPLs fell to 13.9 percent at end-2012, down from 16.3 percent a year before. At the
same time, bank profitability declined amid excess liquidity, slow credit growth, and low net interest
margins. Return on equity fell from 15.2 percent at end-2011 to 6.6 percent at end-2012.
10.
But four credit institutions were intervened since the last Article IV Consultation amid
rising loan losses. Snoras bank—at the time the largest domestically-owned bank, third largest
bank by deposits, and fifth largest by assets (10 percent of system assets)—was liquidated in late
2011, as the bank became insolvent due to alleged fraud and misappropriation of assets (Annex I).
The government financed the payout of insured deposits through a loan to the deposit insurance
agency, but is expected to be largely reimbursed by Snoras’ bankruptcy estate. In late 2012/early
2013, two small credit unions were closed as rapid lending growth and some related-party lending
had given rise to large loan losses and insolvency. On February 12, 2013, another domesticallyowned bank (the largest after the liquidation of Snoras, with about 5 percent of system assets) was
intervened and subsequently declared insolvent, after it was unable to raise sufficient capital to
absorb losses and address problems of related-party lending. After an initial report by the

6

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

REPUBLIC OF LITHUANIA

temporary administrator, a domestically-owned bank with significant EBRD participation signed an
agreement to take over a portion of the intervened bank’s assets (the “good” assets) and liabilities
(insured deposits) and to resume banking services by March 5, 2013. The value of the assets that
were taken over was based on an external auditor’s initial report. A more comprehensive asset
valuation exercise will be undertaken, with results expected in three months. The government is
expected to provide a loan to the deposit insurance agency to cover the shortfall between good
assets and insured deposits, which could amount to ¾ percent of GDP. In all cases, confidence in
the banking system was maintained, largely as a consequence of the authorities’ clear and careful
communication to the public and swift action to provide depositors with access to their funds.

Over the medium term, growth should gradually rise toward its potential of around
3¾ percent. This hinges on a recovery in investment and a modest pick-up in consumption
(supported by falling unemployment and moderate real wage increases) in the coming years. The
contribution of net exports is projected to turn negative in the near term, as stronger domestic
demand boosts imports. However, as the payoff from investment bears fruit later on, export growth
should rise. The output gap is expected to close in 2014, but structural unemployment is expected
to remain high, reflecting skill mismatches. The current account deficit is projected to remain
relatively contained over the medium term, reaching about 2 percent of GDP, and financed mostly
by FDI.

Risks to the outlook have moderated, but remain tilted to the downside. Financial
conditions—both globally and in Lithuania—have improved markedly in the past six months, but
risks continue to emanate from both external and domestic sources. Renewed financial stress or
weak growth in Europe, which accounts for about two thirds of Lithuanian exports, would adversely
affect Lithuania through trade and financial channels. A growth slowdown in other trading partners,
such as Russia, would also weigh on Lithuania’s exports. While risks of a renewed bout of parent
bank funding withdrawal have moderated, Lithuania’s largely foreign-owned banking system still
has a LTD ratio of 120 percent on average. Econometric analysis confirms that the impact of shocks
to trading partner growth and parent bank funding is quite sizeable (Box 1). Continued strong policy
implementation can help ensure that Lithuania is well-placed to deal with these risks should they
materialize. On the domestic side, the projected pickup in investment could fail to occur (possibly
because credit does not recover as anticipated under the baseline) or competitiveness gains could
be eroded by wage growth outpacing productivity growth—both of which would hamper the
recovery.

This box assesses the impact of shocks to trading partner growth and parent bank funding. A Bayesian
Vector Autoregression (BVAR) (Villani, 2009) was used, with a sample covering 1998Q1-2012Q3. The BVAR has the
advantage of improving the estimation efficiency and, given the short sample period, is particularly appropriate.

Trading partner growth has a strong impact on
Lithuania’s GDP, mainly through trade and financial
channels. Econometric analysis suggests that a one
percentage point adverse shock to trading partner growth
would cause Lithuania’s growth to decline by 1¼ percentage
points, with the spillover impact peaking after four quarters.
Trade linkages explain a major part of the spillovers during
the first four quarters immediately after the shock, with the
financial (credit) channel playing a dominant role thereafter.
FDI and fuel price channels have a more limited impact.
A shock to parent bank funding also has a strong impact
on growth, mainly through financial and FDI channels. A
one percent of GDP drop in quarterly parent bank funding
flows causes GDP growth to drop by 0.8 percentage point,
with the impact peaking after four quarters.
These econometric results need to be interpreted with
some caution. Due to the short sample period, the
econometric results here may also capture the boom and
bust cycle and hence may overestimate the impact of
spillovers.

would be adversely affected by a
protracted growth slowdown in
Europe. The effects could be partly
mitigated by the diversification of
Lithuania’s export base.

Medium
Uncertainty could raise borrowing
costs and dampen export prospects.
Nordic parent banks could
deleverage more quickly, hampering
credit, investment, and growth.
Medium
A renewed bout of deleveraging
could stall the economic recovery by
further reducing credit expansion.

Medium
Lithuania’s energy intensity is
relatively high, suggesting that an
oil shock would have adverse effects
on inflation and growth. A
mitigating factor would be the
impact on Lithuania from stronger
growth in Russia.
Medium
Lithuania’s economic recovery
would be adversely affected, as
exports would suffer.

A loss in competitiveness would
undermine the macroeconomic
rebalancing that has taken place to

Authorities’ views
15.
The authorities broadly agreed with staff’s assessment of the outlook and risks. They
shared the view that growth and inflation would moderate this year. Their growth forecasts were
similar to staff’s, and they agreed that investment would need to become the driver of growth.
However, they viewed credit to be less of a constraint on investment, given the availability of EU
funds and large liquidity buffers in the corporate sector. On inflation, the authorities’ projections
were slightly higher than staff’s, given uncertainty over how fast falling global commodity prices
would translate into lower inflation and how higher minimum wages would affect core inflation.

POLICY DISCUSSIONS
A. Securing Fiscal Space
16.
The fiscal deficit is expected to decline to 3 percent of GDP in 2012, down from
9½ percent of GDP in 2009. This also represents a decline of some 2½ percentage points of GDP
compared with 2011, mainly owing to the continued freeze of public sector wages and other cuts in
primary expenditure. Large one-off dividend payments from state-owned enterprises (SOEs) also
helped, and over-performance of CIT partly offset lower-than-expected VAT and excise duties (likely
the result of tax administration weaknesses).
17.
The authorities’ deficit target of 2½ percent of GDP in 2013 is appropriate, but staff
underscored the need for high quality measures. Given that the recovery is slowing, the deficit
target balances the need for further deficit reduction and support for the recovery. This translates
into a structural adjustment of about ½ percent of GDP (taking into account the one-off measures
on SOE dividends in 2012). However, the quality of fiscal measures has weakened over time and the
consolidation in 2013 relies mainly on extensions of temporary measures (Box 2).
18.
Fiscal consolidation should continue over the medium term to fully rebuild fiscal
buffers. Lithuania is a small, open economy that is highly susceptible to external shocks. Moreover,
it lacks monetary policy tools under its Currency Board Arrangement (CBA) and, thus, must rely on
fiscal policy to provide support to the economy during downturns. It is, therefore, important that the
structural fiscal deficit and public debt ratio continue to be reduced. This would bolster fiscal buffers
and create space to allow automatic stabilizers to operate during future periods of weak growth. It
will also help address external vulnerabilities by reducing reliance on foreign financing. The pace of
consolidation going forward should balance supporting the recovery with the need to reach the
authorities’ medium-term objective (MTO) of a small structural surplus.
19.
Staff welcomed the authorities’ focus on tax reform, and emphasized that the
composition of fiscal adjustment should shift to the revenue side. There is significant scope to
implement high quality revenue measures to complete the fiscal adjustment in the medium term.
The authorities have established working groups on tax policy and revenue administration to
develop options for tax reform. The wide-ranging membership of the working groups, which include
social partners and business representatives, could help achieve broad support for reforms. Staff
INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

11

REPUBLIC OF LITHUANIA

supported the creation of the working groups, and underscored that the case for shifting the
composition of adjustment to revenue side is strong, based on the following points.


There is scope to increase revenue in Lithuania. So far, most of the fiscal consolidation has
taken place on the expenditure side. Partly as a result of this strategy, Lithuania’s revenue- and
expenditure-to-GDP ratios were the lowest in the EU in 2011. Hence, future fiscal adjustment
should aim to raise revenue.



Capital and wealth taxes and further base broadening can generate additional revenue. A
comparison of Lithuania’s tax system with EU averages shows that the share of capital and
wealth taxes in total tax revenue is very low in Lithuania (9 percent), compared with EU averages
(20 percent). This suggests that Lithuania has significant room to expand these taxes in order to
generate additional revenue. Also, within the current system, there is scope to broaden the
bases for corporate and personal income tax by removing exemptions and closing loopholes.



Apart from raising revenue, these tax changes have added benefits, including their
potential to better protect lower-income earners. Wealth and capital taxes are less
distortionary, less cyclical, and can be designed to ensure that higher-wealth and higher-income
individuals contribute most to revenue generation, hence improving the progressivity of the tax
system. Staff analysis suggests that the social benefits system contributes far more to the
reduction in inequality than the tax system. At the same time, Lithuania’s income inequality, as
measured by the Gini coefficient, remains one of the highest in the EU, suggesting that it is
possible to complement the progressivity in the social security system with added progressivity
in the tax system (see Box 3).



To reap the benefits of this strategy, staff urged the authorities to improve tax
administration. This would help ensure that any changes in taxation ultimately bear fruit in
terms of revenue generation and boost tax compliance more broadly. Recent legislative
amendments to allow faster collection of tax arrears and reduce the ability to pay taxes in cash
are welcome, as are efforts to enforce the use of cash-registers and reduce border smuggling.



Expenditure growth should remain prudent. To ensure that the fiscal adjustment is
completed, expenditure growth should be consistent with achieving the MTO after taking into
account the impact of measures to increase revenue.

Box 2. The Composition of Fiscal Consolidation in Lithuania1
Lithuania’s fiscal adjustment since 2009 has mainly relied on expenditure measures. Although the role
of revenue measures has risen over time, expenditure cuts accounted for around 70 percent of the total
adjustment. As a result, Lithuania has one of the lowest expenditure- and revenue-to-GDP ratios in the EU.

While expenditure measures have been broad
based, this was not so for revenue measures.
Spending cuts were roughly proportional to the
importance of each spending category. However, on
the revenue side, measures focused mainly on indirect
taxes and one-off measures, while direct taxes,
especially wealth taxes, were virtually untouched. The
exceptions were a base broadening of social security
contribution and a reduction of the PIT. The latter was
partly offset by an increase in health insurance
contributions, the burden of which is now shared
between employee and employer.

Box 3. The Scope for Raising Revenue in Lithuania1
Given the need and desirability to shift the burden of fiscal adjustment to the revenue side, a key
question is how to best raise revenue in Lithuania. This box takes a close look at Lithuania’s tax system,
which suggests there is scope for raising revenue by increasing wealth taxation. At the same time, tax
administration improvements should ensure that taxpayers cannot easily evade taxes and that tax collection

Post-public transfer Gini index

Taxes in Lithuania appear to play a limited role in
income redistribution, especially of late. This is
apparent when comparing pre- and post-benefit and
pre- and post-tax Gini coefficients. While social
benefits helped reduce the Gini by about 50 percent in
2010, the tax system only reduced the Gini by
8 percent. Overall, the Gini after transfers (both taxes
and benefits) remains among the highest in the EU.
Recent Fund research suggests that societies with
lower income inequality tend to experience more
inclusive and sustainable growth.

Post-public transfer Gini index

Taxes on labor and consumption exhibit limited or no progressivity for higher incomes, and the
limited taxation of wealth reinforces this trend. The personal income tax does not feature any strong
progressivity beyond the lowest income deciles. This reflects tax exempt thresholds for low income
earners and the uniform flat tax for all others. Similarly, social security contributions are a uniform tax rate on
the wage. The near-absence of wealth taxation further reinforces the trend of an overall tax system with
limited progressivity. At the same time, it is important to note that Lithuania’s social security contributions
are not capped while benefits are capped, thus

Box 4. Tax Policy Recommendations1
 Wealth tax. Introduce an annual motor vehicle tax, graduated per engine capacity (or by weight)
in line with international best practice (0.4 percent of GDP).


Property tax. Expand property taxes to include all residential properties (0.4 percent of GDP).

 PIT base broadening. (i) Eliminate tax exemptions on interest income (0.1 percent of GDP).
(ii) Restrict the exemption from capital gains tax on housing only for the sale of primary residences
and subject all short-term gains on financial assets (realization within three years of acquisition date)
to a withholding tax at a rate of 15 percent. (iii) Subject all pension payments to income tax
(0.5 percent of GDP).
 CIT base broadening. Consolidate reduced/preferential CIT rates on small companies and
realized gains on security transactions up to three years into the standard 15 percent rate; remove CIT
exemptions/preferential rates on investment incentives and tax holiday schemes in free economic
zones (0.5 percent of GDP).

20.
Deepening fiscal reforms would be desirable. A simple, clear, and comprehensive fiscal
rule, alongside a fiscal council, would strengthen the fiscal framework. The rule could usefully
enhance the counter-cyclicality of the existing expenditure rule, while also ensuring that debt is
reduced. Further reform of the pension system to ensure its long-term sustainability is also needed,
especially in light of rapid population ageing. Parametric pension reforms could usefully link future
benefits to demographic factors, separate basic pensions from other pensions (to de-link the
redistributive role of basic pensions from the insurance role of other pensions), and means test
qualification for basic pensions.
Authorities’ views
21.
The authorities emphasized their commitment to continued fiscal prudence. They
agreed that the composition of adjustment should shift to the revenue side, and stressed the
importance of the working group on tax reform to provide options in this regard. They underscored,
however, that job creation was a key priority and that they were still in the process of elaborating
their policy agenda, including the future path for fiscal policy.

B. The Financial Sector—Playing its Supportive Role in Enabling Growth
22.
Supervisory interventions have forcefully addressed weaknesses in some domesticallyowned banks, thereby strengthening financial stability. The intervention of Snoras bank
removed a major threat to financial stability, and the recent steps to rapidly address problems in two
troubled credit unions and another domestically-owned bank underscore the importance of
effective financial sector supervision. The BoL’s stepped-up onsite inspections, careful monitoring of
banks’ loan loss provisions and ongoing efforts to strengthen the supervision of credit institutions
INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

15

REPUBLIC OF LITHUANIA

are essential for the continued health of the banking system. In this context, steps to strengthen
Lithuania’s AML/CFT regime are welcome, including additional dedicated supervisory staff at the
BoL, more risk-based inspections, and new BoL guidelines for customer due diligence. In line with
international standards, the operational independence and resources of the Financial Intelligence
Unit should be strengthened.
23.
The banking system as a whole appears resilient to shocks. BoL stress tests show that,
under severe conditions—including large declines in exports (-20 percent) and output (-13 percent)
and increases in interest rates (+370 bps)—aggregate capital adequacy would still remain at
11 percent, well above the regulatory minimum (8 percent). While provisions-to-NPL ratios are
somewhat below regional peers, this partly reflects the BoL’s more stringent definition of NPLs.3
24.
The financial sector has an essential role to play in enabling sound credit expansion to
support the recovery. Econometric analysis suggests that credit demand and credit supply have
been weak in recent years, although supply side factors dominate somewhat in 2012 (Box 5). Given
available liquidity in banks, supply constraints seem to emanate mainly from NPLs and banks’
rebalancing of funding toward domestic sources, which have given rise to tight lending standards.
While a balanced approach to risks and returns in new credit extension is clearly important to avoid
the excesses of the boom years, sound credit growth is needed to support investment and the
reallocation of resources to the tradable sector.
25.
In this regard, staff urged the authorities to reduce obstacles to NPL resolution. A
comprehensive review could usefully identify any legal, regulatory, or other obstacles to NPL
resolution. In this context, the implementation of the new household insolvency regime in early
2013 is an important step. Recent changes to the corporate bankruptcy and restructuring regime
have been helpful in simplifying procedures and allowing company’s boards to initiate
restructurings. But these changes have not yet been able to speed up lengthy delays—anecdotal
evidence suggests that bankruptcy proceedings take significantly longer in Lithuania than in
regional peers. In this regard, new proposals for appointing bankruptcy administrators, an area
where appeals are common, are a step in the right direction.
26.
Staff welcomed the consolidation of competencies under the BoL. The unification of
financial supervision, in place since early 2012, is paying off, and further steps to bring
macro-prudential policy under the competency of the BoL is welcome. In this regard, the BoL is
preparing draft amendments to the BoL law. Going forward, it will be important to monitor the
resource implications of increased responsibilities for the BoL.

3

The BoL defines NPLs as loans that are impaired or 60 days past due. Many countries define NPLs as loans that are
90 days past due.

16

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

REPUBLIC OF LITHUANIA

Authorities’ views
27.
The authorities broadly agreed with staff’s assessment of the financial sector. They
underscored that the interventions of the two banks and two credit unions were necessary to
safeguard financial stability, and that confidence had been maintained. The BoL emphasized that it
would continue its stepped-up monitoring of the financial sector to help ensure that risks were
contained going forward. On NPLs, the authorities noted that improvements in the insolvency
regime for households and corporations were important steps toward NPL resolution. On credit,
they stressed that lending standards were too lax in the pre-crisis period and that some risk aversion
by banks is welcome. In their view, ample liquidity suggested that banks did not face funding
constraints.

C. Competitiveness—a Driver for Longer-Term Growth
28.
Going forward, reaching potential growth requires that competitiveness gains are
locked in. This will depend critically on boosting investment and addressing challenges in the labor
market. It will also help avoid a resurfacing of large current account deficits and the related build-up
of external debt.


Steps to improve the business environment can help spur investment. Administrative
burdens and zoning restrictions make doing business more difficult. The authorities’ intention to
review territorial planning regulations is welcome in this respect. Ongoing efforts to facilitate
compliance with administrative regulations, allow waivers of fines for immaterial breaches on
regulations for recently created companies, and coordinate inspections across several agencies
are also valuable steps. Energy sector reforms continue to be important to reduce costs and
improve efficiency in this sector.



Addressing high unemployment remains a key objective. There is a need to help reduce
structural unemployment. According to the latest census, Lithuania’s population contracted by
some 12 percent over the last decade, of which 75 percent was due to emigration (and over 60
percent of emigration is accounted for by 15–34 year olds). As a result, the average age of the
population increased by four years. Outward migration is now slowing, but retaining young and

Box 5. Does Low Credit Growth Reflect a Lack of Demand or Supply?1
While deleveraging and credit contraction have occurred in tandem in Lithuania, it is difficult to
disentangle whether the observed credit contraction reflects credit demand or supply factors. Since
early 2009, parent bank loans have fallen by nearly 50 percent while credit has contracted by almost
20 percent. On the one hand, the withdrawal of parent funding may have caused the credit contraction. On
the other hand, a lack of demand for credit may have caused subsidiaries to use their excess liquidity to
repay parent funding.
A disequilibrium model was used to identify whether demand or supply constraints drive low credit
growth. A system of demand and supply equations for credit were estimated using maximum likelihood
estimation, and actual credit is assumed to be the lesser of estimated demand or supply. Both price and
non-price factors are allowed to play a role in the equations. Credit demand is modeled as a function of the
cost of credit (interest rate), asset prices, future economic prospects (confidence, new orders,
unemployment), economic and political uncertainty (variability of economic growth forecasts) and some
proxies for borrowers’ financial and profitability situation (credit constraints reported in industry surveys and
corporate profit margins). Credit supply is estimated as a function of return on credit, lending capacity
(deposits and parent funding), the quality of banks’ loan portfolio (NPLs), status of the overall economic
environment, future economic prospects and a Snoras dummy. Most explanatory variables are lagged by
one period. Monthly data were used for the period 2006M10 – 2012M10. Quarterly available data were
linearly interpolated. Credit is defined as the volume of new lending, expressed in real terms.
The model estimation intuitively captures the boom and deleveraging period, and suggests that
credit supply may be constrained. Up to 2008Q4, there was strong excess demand, as supply could not
keep pace with demand growth. The bust that started at end-2008 led to sharply falling demand. While
some deleveraging took place in 2009, it was initially moderate, resulting in excess supply. Deleveraging
subsequently accelerated in 2010 but demand was falling as well. For the recent period, the model identifies
demand not to be the constraining factor, but rather supply. The lack of supply identified by the model
coincides with ample liquidity in the banking sector, but since the model allows for non-price factors, this
can be interpreted as tight lending standards or banks’ high risk aversion, possibly on account of high NPLs.

Wage growth should reflect productivity growth. While the recent large increase in the
minimum wage can probably be accommodated given past productivity gains, there is a risk
that it will feed into general wages and inflation, and erode competitiveness. More generally, it
will be important that wage growth does not outpace productivity growth going forward.

Authorities’ views
29.
The authorities shared the view that it was important to lock in competitiveness gains.
They attached high priority to job creation and addressing high unemployment. They also saw a
need to boost investment to sustain the recovery. On minimum wages, they stressed that an
increase was warranted as inflation had increased by over 20 percent since the beginning of 2008
while the minimum wage had remained flat until mid-2012. They were confident that the increase
could be accommodated, given past productivity gains.

D. Euro Adoption
30.
Euro adoption remains an important goal. The CBA withstood the 2008–09 crisis and
liquidity pressures have fallen with reduced vulnerabilities in both foreign and domestic banks.
However, euro adoption remains desirable to complete the path toward full EU integration, ensure
an orderly exit from the CBA in the light of high euroization, reap benefits of lower borrowing costs,
and gain access to ECB liquidity. Therefore, macroeconomic policies should continue to align with
the Maastricht criteria to afford Lithuania the best chance of meeting all criteria for euro
membership, taking into account the limited room to directly influence inflation.
Authorities’ views
31.
The authorities are firmly committed to the goal of euro adoption. They publicly stated
their commitment to seek to join the euro area in 2015. A working group on euro adoption has
been established to review potential impediments, highlight remaining issues, and prepare for a
smooth transition.

STAFF APPRAISAL
32.
Much has been achieved in Lithuania since the crisis of 2008–09. Significant rebalancing
has taken place: the current account and fiscal deficits have been substantially reduced and banks’
dependence on foreign funding has declined notably. A drop in unit labor costs led to quick
competitiveness gains and laid the foundation for an export-led recovery. Debt has declined across
most sectors of the economy.
33.
Locking in these gains is essential for a robust and sustainable recovery. Despite a
difficult external environment, the economy expanded strongly in the last two years, unemployment
has fallen, and exports have grown rapidly. The recovery is expected to continue in 2013, but at a
somewhat slower pace. Risks around this outlook have moderated but remain tilted to the
downside, as renewed financial stress or weak growth in Europe would adversely affect Lithuania
INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

19

REPUBLIC OF LITHUANIA

through trade and financial channels. Looking farther ahead, growth should gradually rise toward its
potential of around 3¾ percent, but this requires that recent competitiveness gains are preserved
and that investment continues to recover.
34.
Completing the fiscal adjustment is important to rebuild Lithuania’s fiscal buffers. In
light of the limited macroeconomic policy tools available under the CBA and Lithuania’s vulnerability
to external shocks, the structural fiscal deficit and public debt ratio should be further reduced. The
2013 budget appropriately targets a further reduction in the deficit to 2½ percent of GDP. Looking
ahead, further reductions in the structural fiscal deficit will be needed in the medium term. To
bolster the fiscal framework, a simple, clear, and comprehensive fiscal rule, alongside a fiscal council,
should be considered. Further reform of the pension system to ensure its long-term sustainability is
also needed.
35.
The composition of fiscal adjustment should shift to the revenue side. So far, most of
the fiscal consolidation has taken place on the expenditure side, while Lithuania’s revenue-to-GDP
ratio is the lowest in the EU. Therefore, taxation of wealth—notably real estate and motor vehicles—
could be expanded to raise additional revenue. There is also scope to broaden the bases for
corporate income tax and personal income tax by reducing exemptions. At the same time, it is
essential that tax administration be improved to ensure that revenue collection does not continue to
fall short.
36.
Recent interventions have forcefully addressed weaknesses in domestic banks. The
intervention of Snoras bank removed a major threat to financial stability, and the recent steps to
rapidly address problems in two troubled credit unions and in another domestic bank underscore
the importance of effective financial sector supervision. In this context, the BoL’s stepped-up onsite
inspections, strict stress testing, and careful monitoring of banks’ loan loss provisions are essential
for the continued health of the banking system. Ongoing efforts to strengthen the supervision of
credit institutions are welcome.
37.
The financial sector has an essential role to play in supporting a robust and sustainable
recovery. The banking system as a whole is well-capitalized and liquid, but NPLs remain high. While
Lithuania has so far been able to continue its economic recovery despite negative private sector
credit growth for nearly four years, it is important that credit is not unduly constrained going
forward. In this regard, a review of obstacles to timely NPL resolution would be a welcome step
toward ensuring that credit supply is not constrained. The new household insolvency regime and
recent proposals to modify the corporate insolvency regime are welcome.
38.
Reducing unemployment and boosting investment are essential for medium-term
growth. Job creation should be supported through training and active labor market policies,

1/ Excluding foreign bank branches.
2/ Total profits (losses) after tax. Interim quarterly results are annualised.
3/ From end-2005 to Q1-2008, NPLs are loans overdue more than 60 days. Untill 2004 NPLs are loans in Substandard, Doubtful and Loss loans categories.
4/ Starting June 2008, non-performing loans are defined as the sum of impaired loans and non-impaired loans that are overdue more than 60 days.
5/ Large exposure means loans granted to the borrower the net value of which equals to, or exceeds, 10 per cent of bank capital.
6/ Credit registry data from 2005. According to Nace 1. Due to ongoing revisions to Nace 2, no data available for 2011-12.
7/ Composition of liquid assets and current liabilities is defined in the Liquidity Ratio Calculation Rules approved by Resolution No. 1 of
the Board of the Bank of Lithuania of 29 January 2004.
8/ Data as of the end of period.
9/ As defined in Rules for Calculation of Capital Adequacy approved by Bank of Lithuania Board Resolution No. 138 of 9 November 2006.
10/ Information is based on interbank deals of all maturities (mostly overnights) made between resident banks in national currency within the last quarter of the period.
11/ The large majority of foreign currency loans and foreign currency liabilities are in euros, to which the national currency is pegged via a currency board arrangement.
12/ Specific provisions include provisions against general portfolio risk until end-2004. From end-2005, due to the change in definition of NPLs, specific
provisions are not directly attributable to the NPLs. Therefore, the ratio may be negative.
13/ Specific provisions include allowances for both individually and collectively assessed loans.

1/ Derived as [r - g - (1+g) + (1+r)]/(1+g++g) times previous period debt stock, with r = nominal effective interest rate on external debt; = change in domestic GDP deflator in US dollar terms, g = real GDP growth rate,
 = nominal appreciation (increase in dollar value of domestic currency), and  = share of domestic-currency denominated debt in total external debt.
2/ The contribution from price and exchange rate changes is defined as [-(1+g(1+r1+g++g) times previous period debt stock. increases with an appreciating domestic currency (> 0) and rising inflation (based on GDP deflator).
3/ For projection, line includes the impact of price and exchange rate changes.
4/ Defined as current account deficit, plus amortization on medium- and long-term debt, plus short-term debt at end of previous period.
5/ The key variables include real GDP growth; nominal interest rate; dollar deflator growth; and both non-interest current account and non-debt inflows in percent of GDP.
6/ Long-run, constant balance that stabilizes the debt ratio assuming that key variables (real GDP growth, nominal interest rate, dollar deflator growth, and non-debt inflows in percent of GDP) remain at their levels
of the last projection year.

Appendix: The Rise and Fall of Snoras Bank1
1.

Snoras was an important domestic player in the Lithuanian banking sector. In a market

dominated by foreign-owned banks, Snoras was the largest domestic bank, with majority stakes
taken by the bank’s two principal owners (68 and 25 percent of the banks ownership). Snoras used
its unique network of over 230 kiosk-style mini-banks to expand into areas not serviced by foreignowned banks and attract a wide depositor base. As such, the bank grew from a small regional bank
in the early 1990s to the 3rd largest bank by depositors and 5th largest by assets as of September
2011 (assets amounted to 7¾ percent of GDP and 9¾ percent of system-wide assets). The bank was
a leading market player in retail lending and credit card issuance, with more than 1,000 employees.
Among its subsidiaries were the Lithuanian Finasta bank and the Latvian Krajbanka.

While an investigation is ongoing, preliminary findings are that misuse and

misappropriation of assets caused the bank’s insolvency. Suspicions of fraud and money
laundering came to light as the Bank of Lithuania (BoL) sought to verify the value of some financial
assets that Snoras reportedly held abroad, but which appeared to be missing. While investigations
are ongoing, some preliminary findings are that (i) various assets recorded in Snoras’ balance sheet
had been transferred out of Snoras ownership; (ii) Snoras’ assets had been provided to other banks
as collateral for loans to companies allegedly related to key individuals related to Snoras (this
collateral was called upon at the time Snoras entered bankruptcy, causing significant loss); and
(iii) certain assets had been purchased at above market value from companies allegedly related to
key individuals related to Snoras, thereby overstating the value on Snoras’ balance sheet. As a result
of this, the bankruptcy administrator’s adjustments as of December 7, 2011 to account for fair value
of assets brought the bank’s equity down from LTL 804 million pre-bankruptcy to LTL -3,303
million—a loss of about €1.2 billion—implying that the bank was insolvent.
3.

The authorities intervened the bank on November 16, 2011. While the authorities had

been taking several steps to address their concerns around Snoras bank since early 2011—these
included, among others, imposing a time limit for increasing capital—intervention was accelerated
by press leaks on November 15, 2011 about problems in domestic banks. The authorities intervened
the next day, imposed a moratorium, and appointed a temporary administrator. Depositor accounts
were frozen for about one week, but small withdrawals were allowed after that. The authorities
considered several restructuring options, and even passed additional legislation in December 2011
to allow for a good bank-bad bank approach. However, in the light of the criminal allegations facing
the bank, and the authorities’ assessment that a merger or P&A would unlikely be successful,

especially not under the given time constraint, the authorities chose liquidation, and on
November 24, Snoras’ banking license was revoked. This triggered the activation of the deposit
insurance, and depositors were paid out up to the guaranteed LTL 345,280 (€100,000) from
December 14 onward for a total of LTL 4 billion (€1.2 billion or 4 percent of GDP). The government
financed this by tapping into the reserves of the Deposit and Investment Insurance (DII) which
amounted to LTL 1.7 billion, and by using cash reserves supposed to pre-finance an early 2012
government bond redemption, which were on-lent to the DII for a total of LTL 3.1 billion. The loan of
the government to the DII is for 6 years at zero interest. After a lengthy juridical process, the final
decision on bankruptcy was made by the creditor committee on July 19 and approved by court on
August 22. A detailed overview of the events is elaborated in the timeline below.
4.

The banking system showed marked resilience immediately following the intervention.

While there were some initial depositor withdrawals, mostly but not exclusively in domestic banks,
banking system confidence was generally maintained. As soon as Snoras’ depositors were paid out
(about 77 percent of deposits were transferred to the accounts in banks and only 23 percent of
them were paid in cash, reflecting continued trust in the banking system), foreign-owned banks
absorbed the majority of this liquidity, while domestic banks also gradually restored deposits to preSnoras intervention levels. CDS and government bond spreads rose only moderately and soon
returned to pre-intervention levels. From mid-December onward, the BoL temporarily engaged in
open market operations to tackle temporary liquidity imbalances across the banking system. These
operations consisted of liquidity-absorbing term deposit auctions, liquidity-providing repo auctions
and auctions for outright purchases of eligible securities. The size of these interventions was small
and any liquidity provision was well within the precautionary buffer that the BoL has for liquidity
provision under the currency board arrangement. These temporary operations ended by mid-April
2012.

The intervention impacted the financial landscape, but had also other repercussions.

With Snoras gone, the banking system became 90 percent foreign-owned, with no single domestic
player accountable for more than 5 percent of system deposits. With the removal of Snoras’ banking
license in November 2011, the monetary accounts do not take into account any Snoras assets or
liabilities from December 2011 onward. In terms of fiscal accounts, the intervention is expected to be
treated as a below the line operation whereby the government’s increase in liabilities to facilitate the
depositor payout is matched by an increase in assets, consisting of the loan to the DII. The
repayment of this loan is expected through the DII’s claims on Snoras bank.
6.

Asset recovery may fall slightly short of compensating priority claims, including the

depositor insurance. Recovery prospects are uncertain at this stage, being largely dependent on
default levels on the loan book, the cost of realization of the loan book, the outcome of the asset
sale process and of financial assets under investigation for misappropriation, and the costs of the
bankruptcy process itself. However, based on preliminary data, the value of total assets just about
covers the claim of the depositor insurance, i.e. before the costs of the bankruptcy process are taken
into account.

The currency of Lithuania is the litas. From April 1, 1994 to February 1, 2002, the litas was pegged to
the U.S. dollar at LTL 4 per U.S. dollar under a currency board arrangement. Since February 2, 2002 the
litas has been pegged to the euro at LTL 3.4528 per euro. Lithuania joined the European Union (EU)
on May 1, 2004, and ERM II on June 28, 2004. Lithuania has accepted the obligations of Article VIII of
the Fund’s Articles of Agreement and maintains an exchange system free of restrictions on the making
of payment and transfers for current international transactions except for those maintained solely for
the preservation of national or international security and which have been notified to the Fund
pursuant to Executive Board Decision No. 144-(52/51).

Anti-Money Laundering and Combating Financing of Terrorism: Lithuania’s compliance with the
international AML/CFT standard, the Financial Action Task Force’s (FATF) 40+9 Recommendations,
was assessed by MONEYVAL, the FATF-style regional body of which it is a member, in January 2006.
The assessment report indicated several deficiencies and the authorities have taken steps to address
them. A new assessment by MONEYVAL is expected to be published in early 2013.

REPUBLIC OF LITHUANIA

STATISTICAL ISSUES
General: Over the past several years, Lithuania has made good progress in establishing a macroeconomic
database. Official data for all sectors are adequate for surveillance purposes. Lithuania subscribed to the
Special Data Dissemination Standard (SDDS) in May 1996, and its metadata have been posted on the Fund’s
Dissemination Standards Bulletin Board (DSBB) since April 1997. Lithuania meets the SDDS specifications for
coverage, periodicity and timeliness of the data, and for the dissemination of the advance release calendars. A
significant amount of economic and financial information is now available on various websites through the
Internet (see section on Dissemination of Statistics, below). A ROSC data module was published in November
2002.
National Accounts: The national accounts are compiled by Statistics Lithuania (SL) (the former Department of
Statistics) in accordance with the guidelines of the European System of Accounts 1995 (ESA 95). Quarterly GDP
estimates at current and at constant prices are compiled using both the production and expenditure
approaches. GDP estimates by production are considered to be more reliable than the corresponding
estimates by expenditure, but no statistical discrepancies between these two estimates are shown separately in
the published figures as the discrepancies are included in the estimates of changes in inventories. The annual
and the quarterly national accounts are compiled at previous year prices and chain-linked to 2000. In general,
good data sources and sound methods are used for the compilation of the national accounts, but measuring
activity during the volatile environment of the 2008/09 crisis proved challenging. Moreover, difficulties remain
in measuring the economic activity of the informal sector. These estimates are compiled at detailed levels of
economic activity using fixed coefficients derived from a benchmark surveys conducted in 1996 and 2003, and
updated in 2006, and in 2011. According to the most recent updates, the informal sector was estimated to be
13 percent of GDP in 2008.
Price Statistics: Since December 1998, CPI weights have been updated annually. The monthly CPI is available
in the second week following the reference month. The producer price index is calculated according to the
chain-linked Laspeyres formula with weights updated every year.
Government Finance Statistics: Data on the central government budget execution are available at a monthly
and quarterly frequency, although these data are subject to frequent revisions. The ongoing treasury project is
expected to improve fiscal data quality substantially. However, further work is needed to clarify the treatment
of public health care providers and of EU transactions, and the consolidation procedure for government
operations. A new classification, incorporating the GFSM2001 was approved in mid-2003. Since then, the MoF
has been reporting to STA general government’s annual data on an accrual and cash basis (except for local
governments, which are still on a cash basis) for publication in the Government Finance Statistics Yearbook
(GFSY). In addition, the MoF has been reporting quarterly and monthly data in the GFSM 2001 format for
publication in the IFS.
Monetary Statistics: The Bank of Lithuania (BoL) reports monetary and financial statistics (MFS) to STA on a
timely and regular basis. The scope, concepts and definitions of the MFS are broadly in line with the guidelines
of the Monetary and Financial Statistics Manual (MFSM). Following Lithuania’s accession to the European
Union, the BoL implemented the ECB framework for compiling and reporting monetary data reflecting the ECB
regulations and ESA 95 on sectorization, valuation and classification of financial instruments.
6

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

REPUBLIC OF LITHUANIA

Balance of Payments: The BoL is responsible for compiling balance of payments, international investment
position (IIP), external debt and international reserves statistics. The BoL reports quarterly data on balance of
payments, IIP and monthly international reserves to STA on a timely and regular basis. Balance of payments
data (on a monthly and quarterly basis) are compiled using the format recommended in the Balance of
Payments Manual, fifth edition (BPM5). The monthly data correspond to several key balance of payments
components, compiled on the basis of a sample survey covering the public sector, commercial banks, and
some nonfinancial private sector institutions. The Data Template on International Reserves and Foreign
Currency Liquidity is disseminated monthly according to the operational guidelines and is hyperlinked to the
Fund’s DSBB. Since late 2004, the BoL disseminates quarterly external debt data in the World Bank’s Quarterly
External Debt Statistics (QEDS) database.
Data Standards and Quality: The authorities publish a range of economic statistics through a number of
publications, including the SL's monthly publication, Economic and Social Developments, and the BoL's
monthly Bulletin. A significant amount of data are available on the Internet:


metadata for data categories defined by the Special Data Dissemination Standard are posted on the
IMF’s DSBB (http://dsbb.imf.org);



the BoL website (http://www.lb.lt/statistical_data_tree) provides data on monetary statistics, treasury
bill auction results, balance of payments, IIP, external debt and other main economic indicators;



the SL website (http://www.stat.gov.lt/lt/) provides monthly and quarterly information on economic
and social development indicators;



the MoF (http://www.finmin.lt) home page includes data on the national budget, as well as
information on laws and privatization; and government finance statistics (deficit, debt).



NASDAQ OMX Baltic website (http://www.nasdaqomxbaltic.com/market/?lang=en) includes

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2013 Article IV Consultation with
Republic of Lithuania
On March 22, 2013, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded
the Article IV consultation with Lithuania. 1
Background
Since the 2008-09 crisis, significant progress has been made in reducing macroeconomic
imbalances, and the economic recovery is well underway. Growth registered 3½ percent
in 2012, supported by strong exports and a bumper harvest. Private consumption was also
robust, reflecting rising consumer confidence and improving labor market conditions.
Unemployment fell to 13.2 percent and has been on a declining trend for both youth and the
long-term unemployed. Inflation slowed to 3.2 percent in 2012 as the effects of rising global
commodity prices moderated. Core inflation, meanwhile, remained fairly subdued at 2 percent.
Strong export growth and an improvement in the terms of trade helped reduce the current
account deficit to 0.9 percent of GDP in 2012.
The fiscal deficit narrowed from 9½ percent of GDP in 2009 to 5½ percent of GDP in 2011, and
to an estimated 3 percent of GDP in 2012. The government successfully raised about
€1¾ billion in international markets in 2012 and redeemed €1 billion maturing in early March.
The largely foreign-owned banking system, overall, remained well capitalized, liquid, and
profitable. Credit growth remains weak and nonperforming loans, while declining, are still high.
Along with falling interest rate margins, this led to a decline in bank profitability.
Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On
return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the
Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the
Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the
country's authorities. An explanation of any qualifiers used in summings up can be found here:
http://www.imf.org/external/np/sec/misc/qualifiers.htm.

Four credit institutions were intervened since the last Article IV consultation—two domesticallyowned banks and two credit unions—due to insolvency. This has removed an important threat
to financial stability and strengthened the overall soundness of the financial system, while
accesses to guaranteed deposits and financial stability have been maintained.
The government has announced its intention to seek euro adoption in 2015.
Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors welcomed the ongoing recovery and the impressive macroeconomic
rebalancing since the 2008–09 crisis. The reduction in the fiscal and current account deficits
has significantly reduced vulnerabilities, and competitiveness gains have laid the foundation for
an export-led recovery. Directors agreed that investment and continued structural reforms will
be critical to sustain competitiveness gains, reduce unemployment, and support growth in the
medium term.
Directors commended the strong fiscal adjustment undertaken to date. They noted that
the 2013 budget balances the need to support the recovery with further consolidation. Looking
ahead, Directors agreed that further reductions in the structural fiscal deficit will be needed to
rebuild buffers. They encouraged the authorities to shift the composition of fiscal adjustment to
the revenue side, and stressed the importance of high quality measures to ensure sustainability
while reducing income inequality. They saw merit in expanding wealth and property taxes and
broadening the tax base, noting that improvements in tax administration should accompany any
new revenue measures. Directors also called for strengthening the fiscal framework and further
reform of the pension system.
Directors commended the authorities for the intervention in four insolvent credit institutions
which has strengthened the overall soundness of the financial system. They underscored the
importance of continuing enhanced supervision, including stepped-up on-site inspections, strict
stress testing, and close monitoring of banks’ loan loss provisions. Directors agreed that the
financial sector has an essential role to play in supporting growth and investment, and
emphasized that credit should not be unduly constrained going forward. To foster sound credit
growth, they supported a review of obstacles to timely resolution of nonperforming loans and
welcomed steps to improve the insolvency framework.
Directors stressed that maintaining competitiveness, addressing labor market inefficiencies, and
enhancing the business and investment environment will be key to sustain growth and reduce
unemployment over the medium term. They underscored that future wage growth should not
outpace productivity growth. They encouraged the authorities to support job creation through
training, active labor market policies, and addressing any disincentives to work in the benefits
system. Efforts are also needed to reduce administrative burdens and improve energy

3
efficiency. Directors welcomed the authorities’ goal of joining the euro area in 2015 from a
strong and sustainable base.

Statement by Mr. Audun Groenn, Executive Director on Republic of Lithuania
and Ms. Ramune Arust, Advisor to Executive Director

My Lithuanian authorities thank staff for the frank and constructive discussions as well as
valuable policy advice. The authorities broadly agree with staff’s findings and analysis in
the report and thoroughly consider the recommendations.
The GDP growth remains strong
Lithuania’s economy has, after the vibrant recovery in 2011, returned to a more
sustainable growth path. Nevertheless, the real GDP growth rate at 3.6 percent in 2012
remained the second highest in the EU. The solid economic growth has been led by the
export sector supported by improving competitiveness and adjusting unit labour costs.
Lithuania’s relative advantage is its diversified export base. Two thirds of Lithuanian
exports go to the EU partners, mostly more robust economies, such as Germany, Poland,
the Netherlands, and the Baltic peers; about one third of trade is with the CIS countries.
The contribution of investment to economic growth was moderate in 2012, but it is
expected to strengthen with increasing manufacturing capacity utilization and stabilising
expectations. The industry survey shows that the industrial companies now use a
historically large share – about three quarters – of their production capacity and some
businesses are starting to face shortage of inventories. However, the non-financial
corporate sector still remains cautious about making new investments and follows news
regarding global financial uncertainties.
The growth in 2013 is expected to slow down, but will remain among the strongest in the
EU. In line with IMF and other international financial institutions, the Ministry of
Finance (MoF) and the Bank of Lithuania (BoL) projects that the real GDP growth will
be at about 3 percent in 2013. The deteriorating export growth prospects are behind the
expected deceleration of economic growth.
Inflation is slowing down
The average annual inflation rate declined from 4.1 percent in 2011 to 3.2 percent in
2012. The decrease in inflation was driven by external factors, foremost by slower
growth of food and fuel prices in international markets. The prices of industrial goods
and market services, which mostly depend on domestic factors, slightly increased but had
an insignificant influence on inflation. For 2013, the forecast is for headline inflation to
decline to 2.4 percent, though subject to developments in global commodity prices.
The Government expects that the minimum wage increase will have a minimal effect on
inflation and competitiveness due to a substantial increase in productivity over the past
years. The decision to raise the minimum wage was made only after extensive
consultations with employers, who did not see major difficulties for the increase. Only

2
SMEs were more concerned, therefore, the Government has foreseen support measures
for SMEs at the initial stage.
External sector balances improved
Lithuania’s export development has positively affected the current account balance. As
export growth outpaced import growth, the trade balance has become positive in 2012.
Only larger reinvested earnings of the foreign capital enterprises led to an income
account and subsequently to a current account deficit.
Gross foreign reserves increased by 1.4 percent in 2012 and accumulated by more than
40 percent since the 2008 crisis. Foreign reserves (in absolute terms) are currently at their
highest historical level. In 2012, the reserve coverage in percent of short-term debt
increased by 9 percentage points, surpassing 60 percent.
The unemployment and business environment has been improving
Strong growth in the domestic economy in the past two years led to an improvement of
the labor market. In 2012, the unemployment rate stood at 13.2 percent or 2.1 percentage
points lower than a year earlier. Employment has been growing mainly due to a rise in
the number of employed persons in the private and, in particular, the tradable sector.
Public sector employment remains almost unchanged. Long-term unemployment has
been decreasing for more than a year, however, about half of the unemployed are longterm and this ratio has not changed since the end of 2010.
The reduction in unemployment, with a particular focus on youth unemployment,
remains the Government’s top priority. For this reason, the Government has started a
revival of the housing renovation program. The expected benefits of the housing
renovation program are not only a reduction of imported energy consumption, but also
creation of jobs and at the same time stimulation of the construction sector, which
suffered the most during the crisis. The longer-term measures aimed at reducing
unemployment and youth unemployment, in particular, focus on improving the balance
between the specialist supply and labor market demands, increasing vocational training,
providing support for self-employed and start-ups, as well as increasing flexibility in
labor regulation.
In addition, the Government is revising the rules for registering business and territorial
planning, as well as insolvency procedures to improve the business environment. The
initiated energy sector reforms also play an important role here. Therefore, it is expected
that these measures, alongside with continuing economic growth, will gradually improve
the situation in the labor market.
Responsible fiscal policies are oriented towards growth
During the last three years Lithuania has undertaken substantial fiscal consolidation
measures, bringing the general government deficit from 9.4 percent of GDP in 2009 to
the expected 3 percent of GDP in 2012. The 2013 budget aims to reduce the deficit to

3
2.5 percent. Fiscal consolidation was focused on the expenditure side, including sizable
cuts in wages. These measures were necessary to restore market confidence, regain
competitiveness, and to put the public finances on the sustainable path.
The Government remains committed to strictly adhering to the Law on fiscal discipline
adopted in 2007 and observing medium-term fiscal targets as set in the 2012
Convergence Program. However, the Government’s key priorities now are to encourage
economic growth, reduce unemployment and to put the economy on a strong and
sustainable growth path. To achieve these goals, the Government intends to pursue active
investment policies. For this reason, in addition to improving the business environment,
the Government intends to intensify the use of available EU funding and financing
provided by the international financial institutions as well as to devote more budget funds
for investments.
The Government agrees that further fiscal consolidation should shift from the expenditure
to the revenue side. In this regard, the authorities are determined to improve the tax
administration and compliance measures as well as to revise the tax system. A working
group for this purpose has been established with the task to prepare recommendations on
the tax system reform by June of this year. The Fund’s suggestions will be considered.
The resilience of the financial sector has been tested and strengthened
The resilience of the banking system continued to improve. The NPLs have been
decreasing and the quality of the loan portfolio has improved. The capital adequacy and
liquidity ratios have strengthened and are above the Basel III requirements. The loan-todeposit ratio is gradually approaching 100 percent due to a considerably faster growth in
deposits, compared to a subdued rebound of the loan portfolio. Low interest rates and an
improving financial position of the private sector are expected to strengthen credit
demand. The recent bank lending survey shows that the demand for credit is expected to
increase and banks do not plan on tightening their lending conditions.
The depositors’ confidence was maintained during the authorities’ interventions in two
smaller size banks. The interventions addressed the residual risks, strengthened the
financial sector going forwards, and testified to the authorities’ supervisory vigilance.
The effects on confidence indicators were only very limited. The interbank rates
continued to decrease and the CDS rates stand at the pre-crisis levels. There was no
impact on the real economy. SNORAS bank was announced insolvent and liquidated,
whereas the healthy share of UKIO bank assets with matching liabilities was transferred
to another bank operating in Lithuania.
During the last three years, the authorities have carried a complete overhaul of the
institutional set-up for micro- and macro- prudential supervision. Both tasks are planned
to be assigned to the BoL. Microprudential supervision of banking, insurance and
financial markets have already been consolidated and enhanced by customers’ rights
protection. To strengthen the macroprudential supervision, a new Financial Stability
Department, with more analytical capacities, has been established at the central bank and

4
has been in operation since May 2012. To entitle legal powers to the BoL for
macroprudential supervision, an amendment to the Law of the BoL is foreseen for 2013.
With that, the reforms to the micro- and macro- prudential institutional set-up will be
fully completed.
The authorities continue to enhance micro- and macroprudential policies in order to
strengthen financial stability. At the end of 2011, the BoL adopted the Responsible
Lending regulations and defined the mandatory limit on loan-to-value and debt-toincome ratios. Currently, a number of measures, such as requirements for the
qualification of the heads of credit unions, limitations on maximum loan per borrower,
tightening the liquidity and the capital adequacy ratios, were introduced to strengthen the
credit union sector.
Preparations for euro adoption are ongoing
The authorities remain committed to introduce the euro from a strong and sustainable
base after the convergence criteria are fulfilled. The newly elected Government has
reconfirmed the euro introduction target and re-launched the necessary preparatory
work.
