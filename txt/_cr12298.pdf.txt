SUDAN
STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2012 ARTICLE IV CONSULTATION
September 7, 2012

KEY ISSUES
Context. The secession of South Sudan in July 9, 2011 translated into the loss of a sizeable
portion of Sudan’s economic potential and a daunting challenge of adjusting to a permanent
external and fiscal shock.
Recent developments. In the aftermath of the South Sudan’s secession, the economic
situation deteriorated. Nonoil real GDP growth decelerated, inflation picked up, the overall
fiscal balance widened, and the exchange rate depreciated considerably.
Recent economic reforms. The authorities adopted in late June 2012 a reform program
centered on fiscal adjustment and exchange rate reform to address the monetary, fiscal, and
external imbalances that have resulted from the secession of South Sudan.
Focus of the discussions. The discussions focused on the appropriateness of the recent
economic reforms to address Sudan’s economic problems and promote sustainable and
inclusive growth.
Outlook. Strong implementation of reforms is key to maintaining macroeconomic stability
and improving medium-term economic prospects. There are also downside risks from the
unstable security situation, including tensions with South Sudan.
Policy recommendations. Action is needed on four fronts: (1) consolidating public finances;
(2) unifying the foreign exchange rates and markets; (3) tightening monetary policy and
strengthening the banking system; and (4) further liberalizing the economy and improving
the business climate.

INTRODUCTION
1.
Deep-seated security issues have for
years posed serious challenges to Sudan’s
economic prosperity. Sudan has experienced
an alternation of civilian and military
governments and two protracted North-South
wars that took a heavy toll on human life and
economic resources. The Comprehensive
Peace Agreement (CPA), signed on
January 9, 2005 by the government of Sudan
and the Sudan People’s Liberation
Movement/Army (SPLM/A) and the secession
of South Sudan in 2011, have created a
window of opportunity for peace and stability.
However, further efforts are needed to address
ongoing conflicts in bordering states.

2.
The 2012 Article IV consultation is
taking place at a unique juncture in the
history of Sudan, following South Sudan’s
secession in July 2011. The secession resulted
in Sudan losing some three-quarters of its oil
production, half of its fiscal revenues, and
about two-thirds of its international payment
capacity (Figures 1 and 2, and Box 1). Adjusting
to a permanent shock of such magnitude is a
daunting challenge and requires a strong
policy response at a time when international
financial support is very limited (Figure 6).
Sudan’s unstable security situation adds to this
challenge.

2012 ARTICLE IV REPORT

Box 1. Impact of the Secession of South Sudan
The secession of South Sudan is having a
significant impact on the Sudanese economy.
While Sudan’s economy is relatively diversified and
open, it has developed since 1999 a marked
dependency on the oil sector that has substantially
increased its vulnerability to external and fiscal
shocks. The oil sector‘s contribution to GDP has been
modest, hovering around 15 percent. However, it
provided sizeable budget revenues and contributed a
major share of the country’s foreign exchange
receipts. The economic and financial losses related to
South Sudan’s secession are substantial and have
affected all the sectors of the economy.



External sector: The main impact is related to
the loss of oil exports estimated at about
US$6.6 billion (12.9 percent of GDP) in 2012.

3.
After a year of uncertainty, the
authorities approved in late June 2012 a
comprehensive reform program to address
the deterioration of the country’s economic
and financial situation. The program—which
builds on the authorities’ Three-Year

Emergency Program1—includes an exchange
rate devaluation of about 66 percent, an
increase in key taxes, a sharp reduction in fuel
1

In mid-2011, the authorities adopted a Three-Year
Emergency Program for 2012–14, which outlines a
comprehensive strategy to address the economic and social
challenges posed by the secession. Its objectives are to
maintain fiscal and external sustainability, boost inclusive
growth, and gradually reduce unemployment.

The response to past IMF advice has
been broadly satisfactory. Sudan
implemented reforms under a series of
13 Staff-Monitored Programs (SMPs)
between 1997 and 2011. Notable
achievements include progress in restoring
macroeconomic stability, liberalizing the
economy, and improving economic
management capacity. However, weaknesses
persist in financial management, revenue
mobilization, and monetary management.The
Fund continues to support the authorities
reform efforts through technical assistance and
policy advice (Box 2).

5.
The political situation remains
fragile owing to persisting, albeit low
intensity, protests following the
announcement of government reforms, and
the volatile security environment. Since
South Sudan’s secession, tensions and military
skirmishes between the two countries have
persisted. African Union–sponsored
negotiations have recently led to a tentative
agreement on oil-related issues.
Implementation of this agreement is, however,
contingent on reaching an agreement on
borders security issues (Box 3).

Box 2. The Fund’s Role in Sudan Since South Sudan Secession
Since the secession of South Sudan, Fund
support to Sudan has consisted of the following:




6

Intensive economic advice and technical
assistance on policies to address the impact
of the South’s secession.
Co-chairing with the World Bank the
Technical Working Group on Sudan’s
external debt (see paragraph 49).

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND



Providing economic advice to the African
Union High Implementation Panel (AUHIP)

South Sudan.



on Sudan prior to the secession of South
Sudan.

SUDAN

2012 ARTICLE IV REPORT

Box 3. Oil-Revenue Agreement Between Sudan and South Sudan
Sudan and South Sudan reached in early August 2012 a

preliminary agreement on oil-revenue sharing.
Implementation of this agreement is, however,
contingent on reaching an agreement on borders
and other security issues. The agreement covers a
period of 3 ½ years, starting from the resumption of
oil production in South Sudan. It includes both a
transitional financial arrangement (TFA)—a transfer
from South Sudan—and pipeline-related fees. Under
the agreement South Sudan will:



Pay pipeline-related fees averaging US$9.7/bl.
These fees were also negotiated for this
3½ year period. Although—unlike the TFA
payments—these will continue after the
3 ½ year period, after being renegotiated.

In addition, it was agreed that Sudan and South
Sudan would initiate a joint outreach campaign to
the international community, with four objectives:
mobilize financing to compensate for Sudan’s
loss of oil revenue;
garner support for debt relief for the two
Sudans, in the context of the Zero Option (see
paragraph 50);
encourage financing for South Sudan’s
development needs; and
lifting of sanctions on Sudan





Provide a TFA payment that totals
US$3.028 billion over 3½ year period. The TFA



payment is expressed in per barrel terms, as
US$15/bl, based on the South Sudan’s projection
of an average of 150,000 bl/day of oil
production. If production is higher, payments will




be made at the rate of US$15/bl until cumulative
payments reach US$3.028 billion.

RECENT DEVELOPMENT, OUTLOOK AND RISKS
A. Developments in 2011 and the First Half of 2012
6.
Sudan’s economic conditions
deteriorated considerably in 2011 in the
aftermath of South Sudan secession. Nonoil
real GDP growth decelerated to 3.4 percent
and inflation picked up at about 18.5 percent
(Figure 5 and Table 1). The overall fiscal deficit
reached 1.3 percent of GDP (Table 3) and was
mostly financed by the banking system, which
resulted in reserve money growing 28 percent;
credit to the economy was subdued at
8 percent (Tables 4 and 5). There was a
contraction in the balance of payments with
exports declining by 13 percent, reflecting the
drop in oil exports which was only partially
offset by the increase in gold exports. Imports
declined by about 8 percent. This restructuring

of the trade balance resulted in a current
account deficit of about 0.5 percent of GDP
(Table 2).
7.
Economic conditions continued to
deteriorate in the first half of 2012. The
fiscal position weakened as revenue underperformed by some 30 percent,2 compared to
an execution rate of over 95 percent for
spending. Reserve money and broad money
grew 24 percent and 25 percent, respectively,
much higher than in the first half of 2011
2

This is mainly due to the fact that no agreement could be
reached with South Sudan on oil transit fees, which
represented almost 30 percent of total revenues in the
original budget.

8.
In order to stop the erosion of the
country’s international reserves, the
authorities introduced in 2011 some
administrative restrictions. These include
rationing foreign exchange, imposing
restrictions on banks’ excess reserves in
foreign currency and on bank deposits in
foreign currency. By year-end, official reserves
stabilized at about US$1.3 billion (1.8 months
of imports).4
9.
Pressures on the Sudanese pound
intensified pushing the premium on the US
dollar to above 100 percent, and induced
the authorities to devalue the exchange
rate of the pound (Figure 4). At end-June,
3

The increase is mainly due to the effects of the devaluation
of the official exchange rate on the monetary aggregates.
Excluding this effect, both reserve money and broad money
would have grown by about 13 percent.

4

Gross official reserves were recently revised to correct for a
misclassification that involved the inclusion on the assets side
of liability items corresponding to short-term external
commitments. The new classification is consistent with the
recommendations of the 2012 IMF multisector statistics
technical assistance mission.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

10.
Sudan’s monetary system is
characterized by moderate dollarization,
with a dynamic curb foreign exchange
market. Last year, foreign currency deposits as
a ratio to broad money (M2) were on a
downward trend from a peak of 16.5 percent
in the first half of 2011 to reach a low 14
percent by end-May 2012, just before the step
devaluation of the pound. The share of loans
in foreign currency in total bank credit was
about 10–15 percent. As a result of the
devaluation, the balance sheets of the central
bank and the commercial banks inflated by
about 40 percent and 20 percent, respectively,
and the share of loans in foreign currency rose
to about 23 percent.
11.
Financial sector indicators were
mixed in the last two years. While the capital
adequacy ratio rose from 10 percent in 2010 to
11 percent in March 2012, nonperforming
loans (NPLs) remained high at 14 percent
(Table 8). Also:


Banks’ liquidity remained high
(37 percent).

SUDAN



Commercial banks’ profitability was
adversely affected by the high share of
NPLs and the holding of large
unremunerated excess reserves; the less
liquid banks suffered also from the rising
reserve requirements.



Banks maintained large interest rate
spreads and prudent lending reflecting
rising risk aversion exacerbated by
deteriorating economic conditions.



Between December 2010 and March 2012,
the return on assets dropped from

B.

2012 ARTICLE IV REPORT

3.9 percent to 1.4 percent and the return
on equity from 26½ percent to 8.1 percent.
12.
The devaluation of the Sudanese
pound is expected to have a notable impact
on the banking system. Staff’s preliminary
estimates show that the capital adequacy ratio
could fall below 10 percent and the NPLs ratio
could exceed 15 percent. The NPLs ratio could
deteriorate further during the next 12 months
when the bulk of banks’ loan portfolio in
foreign currency reaches maturity.

Outlook and Risks

A fragile path to recovery



13.
The economic situation is expected
to continue to be difficult during the next
18 months (2012–13), clouded by the
impact of South Sudan’s secession and tight
financing constraints:

The overall fiscal balance is expected to
reach 3.7 percent of GDP in 2012 before
narrowing to 3.2 percent of GDP in 2013,
reflecting an improved non-oil primary
balance.



The current account deficit is expected to
average 6.9 percent of GDP in 2012–13,
with imports contracting by a
cumulative 20 percent, and capital inflows,
including FDI, dropping by an estimated
50 percent.





Non-oil GDP is expected to decline slightly
in real terms, mostly reflecting a reduction
in domestic absorption consistent with the
fiscal adjustment, and the absence of
offsetting gains on non-resource exports.
The authorities expect an overall GDP
growth of 2 percent in 2012 driven by a
strong performance in the agriculture and
gold sectors.
As a result of the gradual fiscal
consolidation, inflation is expected to
average about 30 percent in 2012, before
easing to 17 percent in 2013.

Medium-term outlook slightly positive,
but with risks
14.
The authorities’ reform package of
June 2012 is an important step toward
restoring macroeconomic stability and
reducing the economy’s dependence on oil
(Box 3). They would allow macroeconomic
conditions to improve gradually starting
in 2014, with non-oil growth picking up to
about 4.5 percent, inflation declining to single
digits, and the fiscal deficit dropping to about
1.5 percent of GDP.

15.
Risks to the outlook are tilted to the
downside. Increased tensions along the
borders with South Sudan could lead to an
increase in military spending, which would add
pressure on the budget. Additional risk relates
to a reform slowdown resulting either from a
pickup in oil and gold production or social
resistance to further reforms (Box 4). On the
upside, the implementation of the recent
tentative agreement with South Sudan on oil
related issues or commitment from the
international community to provide Sudan
debt relief would lessen the country’s fiscal
and external constraints and facilitate the
adjustment process.

10

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

Authorities’ Views
16.
The authorities broadly agreed with
staff’s assessment of the economic outlook
and risks. While emphasizing the difficulty of
the recently adopted reforms, they thought
that these policies were needed to address the
prevailing imbalances. They also
acknowledged the need to sustain the reform
process over the medium term.

POLICY DISCUSSIONS
Policy discussions took place in the context of difficult social, political and security
conditions, and focused on the scope of the government’s policies to address the impact
of South Sudan’s secession and their ability to stabilize the economy and support
economic recovery.
17.
Adjusting to the large economic
shock incurred by Sudan is highly
challenging. It requires the implementation of
a two-tier reform strategy centered on:
(i) short-term adjustment measures to mitigate
the deterioration of economic conditions, and
(ii) a medium-term reform program to refocus
the economy on its non-resource sector.

severity of the fiscal and external shock
compounded by the country’s limited access
to external financing will require additional
efforts over the medium term in order to
restore fiscal sustainability and improve

18.
Sudan’s reform program aims to
address the near-term challenges. Its
underlying policy mix combines fiscal
adjustment, increased exchange rate flexibility
and a tightening of the monetary stance.
Restoring macroeconomic stability and
reinforcing economic conditions would require
however strong and determined
implementation of the reforms. Also, the

Exchange rate reform: The new foreign exchange
regime is centered on four rates:



Increase the VAT from 15 to 17 percent



Increase the development tax from 10 to
13 percent



Increase the Business profit tax on the banking
sector from 15 to 30 percent



Increase stamp duties on financial transactions
and international flights



Repeal the negative list used to limit imports and
impose instead import tariffs



Enhance revenue collection and lift discretional
tax exemptions

Expenditure measures



Phase out fuel subsidies and strengthen social
safety nets



Liberalize the price of sugar



Consolidate ministries at all levels of government

Social spending



Raise the salary of civil servants and pensioners
by 100 SDG per month (about 40 percent of
minimum wage)



More than doubling spending on social benefits



Lower custom duties on main staples and
exempt medicine



A central rate of SDG 4.42 per US dollar that
applies also to the importation of fuel products,
the payment of government obligations, and
valuation assessment at customs;



A subsidized rate for wheat of SDG 2.9 per
US dollar;



A gold exchange rate used by the central
bank in its gold transactions; and



A commercial banks rate that applies to all
other transactions and has three components:
(i) an indicative rate;1 (ii) a variable incentive
premium set by the central bank (currently
15 percent); and (iii) a flexibility factor that
allows banks to deviate from the sum of the
indicative rate and the incentive by a range of
±4 percent.

Monetary policy: Increase the reserve
requirement ratio from 15 percent to
18 percent and roll back CBOS deposits in
commercial banks.

A. Containing the Deterioration of Economic Conditions
The revised 2012 budget goes a long way toward reducing near-term fiscal imbalances;
however, reaching fiscal sustainability will require a determined continuation of the
reform momentum.
20.
Fiscal policy is confronted in the
near term with the major challenge of
adjusting to the loss of about 50 percent of

government revenues. In view of Sudan’s
limited access to external financing and the
need to contain monetary financing, achieving

this objective requires bold action on both the
revenue and expenditure sides.
21.
The authorities’ efforts to enhance
revenue collection are encouraging. Given
the pressing budgetary needs, the moderate
tax increases are likely to be the most feasible
course, although a concerted effort to expand
the tax base through tax policy and
administration measures is needed to raise
revenues on a more sustainable basis. Staff is
of the view that a diligent implementation of
the revenue measures could yield additional
revenues of about 1 percent of GDP higher
than envisaged in the revised budget. It
encouraged the authorities to provide the tax
and customs directorates with adequate
resources, while enhancing tax and customs
administration in line with Fund technical
assistance recommendations.

profit tax on their commission. While gold
producers currently pay a 7 percent royalty,
staff recommended subjecting them to the
business profit tax.
23.
Staff welcomed the replacement of
the negative list by import tariffs, which
will boost revenues. Over the medium term, it
recommends a gradual reduction in the tariffs
to reinforce the openness of the economy.
24.
The authorities’ reduction in fuel
subsidies and the strengthening of social
safety nets are important reforms.6 The
reduction in subsidies will create space for
additional priority spending. Staff underscored,
however, that the budgeted increase in social
safety nets is not targeted, which could limit
their efficiency, whereas the general wage
increase in the civil service could be
inflationary, due to its contagion effects on the
rest of the economy. Finally, staff advised
limiting transfers to states to 30 percent of
total revenues, in line with constitutional
provisions.
25.
Staff encouraged the authorities to
strengthen the government development
budget. This budget has been reduced by
17 percent in nominal terms, which entails a
large drop in real terms. Staff recommended:
(i) a comprehensive appraisal of the
investment budget, including procedures and
project selection, to ascertain that priority
projects are correctly funded; and (ii) the
establishment of quarterly monitoring to
improve the efficiency of execution.

The price increases are 47 percent for gasoline, 23 percent

SUDAN

Authorities’ Views
26.
The authorities broadly agreed with
staff’s assessment. They considered their
revenue projections to be realistic in light of
the limited scope for raising revenue and in
order to avoid undue spending pressure from
other ministries. On gold taxation, they argued
that taxing producers would be
counterproductive as it would reenergize
smuggling. They expressed their determination
to phase out the fuel subsidy by end-2014
(SIP, Chapter 1). They also expressed their
intention to streamline exemptions granted by
law, and to gradually reduce transfers to states
while developing better revenue collection at
lower levels of government.

Monetary policy
27.
In recent years, monetary conditions
in Sudan have been mostly determined by
the fiscal stance and market exchange rate
developments (SIP, Chapter 2). This situation
has been exacerbated by the adverse effects of
the secession of South Sudan: the abrupt rise
in government financing needs, the loss in oil
export proceeds, which affected the central
bank’s foreign reserves accumulation, and the
marked erosion of the domestic currency in
the curb market.
28.
The deterioration of Sudan’s
external and fiscal accounts has affected
the work of the banking system and
weakened CBOS’s independence. Monetary
developments since South Sudan’s secession
were mostly driven by the need to
accommodate the government financing
requirements. The increased monetization of a
fast growing fiscal deficit has adversely
affected the ability of the central bank to
contain inflation, resulting in core inflation

2012 ARTICLE IV REPORT

rising by 44 percent in the 12-month period
through July. The decision by the CBOS to
reschedule about SDG 4 billion (about
2.3 percent of GDP) of its temporary advances
to the government over a 100-year period has
given more space to deficit monetization and
circumvented existing laws.7 At the same time,
credit to the economy was hampered by the
segmentation of the foreign exchange market,
and by an increased risk aversion by banks,
which prefer to lend to state owned
enterprises, or invest in government securities
whose interest rate although negative in real
terms remains well above the level charged by
banks and are in high demand.
29.
The CBOS has taken steps in an
attempt to lessen pressure on the exchange
rate and safeguard external reserves. It has
increased the required reserve ratio from
10 percent to 18 percent since the beginning
of the year, and put in place administrative
measures to tighten controls on banks and
accommodate the government’s financing
requirements. All these measures have proven
inefficient and counter-productive.
30.
Staff underscored the importance of
enhancing monetary management by the
CBOS given the large bank excess liquidity.8
Excess liquidity weakens the monetary
transmission mechanism and undermines the
use of monetary policy for stabilization
purposes. Accordingly, staff recommended
that the authorities:

7

The existing Public Finance Law sets the central bank
financing of the fiscal deficit at a maximum of SDG 1.5 billion.

8

Excess liquidity in Sudan is a systemic problem that dates
back to 1996 at the beginning of the exploitation of oil and
has been persistent since then. It is the direct result of the oilrelated fiscal expansion combined with the country’s low
financial deepening.

SUDAN



Tighten the monetary stance by:
(i) containing credit to the government,
(ii) unwinding the CBOS deposits with
commercial banks, and (iii) refrain from
providing credit to the economy;



Use reserve money rather than the
exchange rate as an anchor to keep
inflation under control;



Refrain from raising the reserve
requirements to stabilize the exchange
rate. This measure increases taxes on
banks and adversely affects their
profitability. Also, in Sudan’s context it has
limited effects on exchange rate
movements, which have their root in the
expansionary fiscal policy and the
increasing monetization of the deficit.



Restore the monetary transmission
mechanism by giving to commercial banks
the appropriate opportunities to recycle
their unused deposit liabilities. This could
be achieved through the organization of a
competitive auction system of CBOS
securities and the reactivation of the
interbank market as a first step toward the
development of open market operations.

31.
Financial stability remains key in
ensuring the success of the government’s
economic and financial reforms. In that
respect, staff recommended a comprehensive
assessment of Sudan’s banking system to
determine the short and medium term effects
of the financial and economic implications of
South Sudan’s secession on banks’ balance
sheets and vulnerability. Such assessment
would help identify the reforms that are
needed to improve the sector’s
competitiveness, efficiency and resilience, and
enhance its development.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

32.
The CBOS’s current role in the gold
market is a burdensome distraction from its
core and demanding responsibility of
maintaining price stability. Prior to the
CBOS’ intervention in the gold market in
early 2011, a significant part of the gold was
smuggled abroad and sold at sub-value. The
CBOS is the sole exporter of gold and has
recently built a gold refinery to increase the
value added of gold and boost its international
reserves. Staff urged the CBOS to gradually
withdraw from this activity.
Authorities’ Views
33.
The authorities concurred with staff
on the need to tighten the monetary stance.
They indicated that they will gradually reduce
the monetization of the deficit as the
government revenue base improves. With
respect to gold, they argued that the CBOS will
continue to play an active role until this
industry is well established and the mining
industry’s regulatory framework finalized.

Exchange rate policy
34.
In recent years, the curb market
exchange rate has gradually become very
important. Following South Sudan’s secession
and the subsequent drop in the oil revenues,
this role became preponderant, heavily
influencing overall economic conditions,
including external trade flows and the
domestic inflation dynamics. This also resulted
in the depreciation of the equilibrium real
exchange rate. Based on available data up to
June 2012, various indicators suggest that the
exchange rate is overvalued, though the

SUDAN

magnitude of the overvaluation remains
uncertain (Box 6).9
35.
In this context, the recent large
devaluation of the official exchange rate
reveals the strong determination of the
monetary authorities to move to a more
flexible exchange rate regime and bridge
the gap with the curb market.10 While staff’s
preliminary qualitative assessment, conducted
prior to the recent devaluation, has found
major vulnerabilities that threaten external
stability and competitiveness, staff strongly
recommended unifying the official market by
eliminating the other three rates (central rate,
subsidized rate, and gold rate), a measure
which would likely facilitate convergence with
the curb market rate (SIP, Chapter 3). Such an
option is consistent with the authorities’ strong
preference for a managed float regime and
could be envisaged provided the commercial
banks rate is kept flexible enough to remain in
line with economic fundamentals; such
increased flexibility is warranted, as evidenced
by the end-July increase in the gap between
the two rates to about 10–15 percent, after
narrowing considerably when the new regime
was introduced in late June. Staff pointed that
the exchange regime and administrative
restrictions could give rise to multiple currency
practices and exchange restrictions under
Article VIII.

2012 ARTICLE IV REPORT

Authorities’ Views
36.
The authorities agreed with staff’s
assessment and the need for greater
exchange rate flexibility. They indicated that
they will continue to monitor market
conditions to ensure that convergence with
the curb rate is achieved. They justified the
existence of special rates by the need to limit
the burden of the devaluation on the
government’s obligations. With respect to the
special rate for gold, they indicated that they
will gradually bring it in line with the
commercial banks rate.

Data problems related to the secession of South Sudan
prevent a meaningful application of quantitative methods,
including CGER procedures.

While the devaluation of the central bank’s indicative rate is
about 66 percent, the effective devaluation of the commercial
banks rate is about 88 percent.

Against this background, on June 25, the authorities have allowed
for a corrective outright exchange rate depreciation of the CBOS
indicative rate from 2.67 to 4.42 SDG/USD and of the commercial
banks rate from 2.88 to 5.45 SDG/USD. This reduced the gap to
the curb rate from over 100 to 23 and 93 to 3 percent (Box
Figure 1) and undid a major part of the REER overvaluation (Box
Figure 2). Until end-July, however, the gap has widened again to
40 and 15 percent, respectively, making the case for continued
exchange rate flexibility to assure that the official rate goes in line
with fundamentals.

The secession of South Sudan resulted in a structural shift in the
balance of payments dynamics. Over the past decade, the current
account was driven by developments in the oil sector—both
exports and FDI. For the medium-term, the BoP is expected to
shrink as a result of the drop in oil exports and limited alternative
source of financing. Accordingly, the current account will depend
on Sudan’s ability to develop its non-oil export base.

Medium-term reforms should aim to refocus the economy on its non-resource sector
by strengthening economic fundamentals and improving the business environment
and growth inclusiveness.

The authorities’ development
strategy outlined in the three-year
economic plan projects a relatively fast
economic recovery. The plan identifies
potential sources of growth and assumes a
timely implementation of comprehensive
reforms that would significantly enhance
economic performance.
38.
In staff’s view, Sudan’s mediumterm challenge is to regenerate most of the
lost economic and financial potential while
minimizing the adjustment cost on the
economy. This would require a gradual
transformation of the economy into a more
competitive economy that could generate the
foreign exchange it needs to cover its imports
requirements and expand, and to deliver the
tax revenues that the government needs to
operate.

service; and (iii) the overhaul of state finances
(SIP, Chapter 4).

safety nets and the investment program..11
Also, subjecting public enterprises to hard

infrastructure investment. This strategy would
limit inflationary financing in the short- and
medium-term, while keeping the non-oil
primary deficit at about 5 percent of GDP, and
ensure progress toward fiscal sustainability in
the long-term. The fiscal reforms should be
centered on: (i) a revision of the government

Promoting competitiveness and inclusive growth will require reforms on a number of

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

In order to boost the economy and ensure
sustained and inclusive growth, government
policies need to remove impediments to
private sector investments and promote a
wage policy linking wages to the economy’s
productivity. Also, encouraging exports would
contribute to rebalance the country’s external

SUDAN

accounts. While active internal demand
management policies would help increase the
country’s export potential, they would need to
be accompanied by supporting policies,
including provision of advice and services to
exporters that could be provided by
specialized agencies and banks.
43.
Staff emphasized the importance of
strengthening small- and medium-size
enterprises (SMEs) and opening up the
economy. SMEs could be a key driver in
promoting economic diversification. Opening
up the economy to foreign investors would:
(i) attract external resources to finance badly
needed investments that would increase
employment and the country’s economic
potential; and (ii) enhance the local knowhow, the best recipe for private sector
development. To support these actions, the
government should focus on developing the
physical infrastructure and human capital, and
improving basic public services. These actions
would generate over time productivity gains,
reduce policy uncertainty and bolster investor
confidence.
44.
Unemployment remains high
(above 20 percent, mostly affecting youth
and women) and poverty is widespread. The
UNDP estimates that currently, about 47
percent of Sudan’s population lives below the
poverty line of less than one U.S. dollar a day.
While Sudan has made progress in each of the
Human Development Indicators, it remains
classified amongst the bottom of developing
countries and lags behind in achieving the
Millennium Development Goals. Staff urged
the authorities to begin to address labor
supply issues by: (i) conducting a skills
assessment aimed at identifying market needs;
and (ii) reforming technical and vocational
training programs and enhancing the quality

of general and technical education (SIP,

45.
Sudan’s membership in the Common
Market for Eastern and Southern Africa and
the Greater Arab Free Trade Area has been
beneficial and is an important step towards
its integration into the world economy.
Also, a greater economic integration with
South Sudan in the form of a common market
would boost trade and economic productivity
of the two countries. Such project would
require however a close coordination at the
policy and institutional levels including the
harmonization of economic policies, and the
integration of the countries’ transportation
infrastructure and network.
Authorities’ Views
46.
The authorities agreed with the
staff’s assessment. They noted that their
current strategy aims to accelerate structural
reforms in order to create new sources of
growth and income to compensate for the loss
of oil revenues. In addition to revitalizing the
agriculture sector, which remains the
backbone of Sudan’s economy, they are
placing greater emphasis on the large
untapped potential of the mining sector as
evidenced by the sharp increase in gold
production.12 They also believe that oil
production could increase over the mediumterm through enhanced recovery of existing oil
wells and the discovery of new ones.

12

Gold production has increased nearly seven fold, from 4
tons in 2008 to 29 tons in 2011, and is projected to further
increase to 50 tons in 2012.

Sudan is in debt distress with the
bulk of its external debt in arrears. A debt
sustainability analysis (DSA) based on the joint
IMF-WB LIC debt sustainability framework and
discussed with the authorities indicates that at
end-2011, all debt indicators exceeded their
thresholds (Annex 1).13 Arrears clearance and
debt relief will be needed to bring Sudan’s
external debt to a sustainable level and gain
access to external financing. Staff strongly
recommended to: (i) establish broad support
for debt relief under the Enhanced HIPC
Initiative, which requires enhancing its
dialogue with creditors and donors;
(ii) continue to cooperate with the IMF on
economic policies; and (iii) limit borrowing on
non-concessional terms as much as possible.

developed debt relief scenarios.
Authorities’ Views
50.
The authorities agreed with staff’s
assessment and advice. However, they
expressed frustration that the debt relief
remains an elusive goal, and feel subject to
unfair treatment by the international financial
community. They stressed that as a result of
the slow progress of negotiations with South
Sudan, they may consider the fallback debt
option of apportioning the debt between the
two countries.15

Sudan’s arrears to the Fund totaled
SDR 983.3 million at end-July. Staff
welcomed the payments made so far in 2012
totaling US$6.7 million against obligations
falling due of SDR 2.49 million (or
US$3.85 million). Staff strongly encourages the
authorities to continue making payments to
the Fund, to make them on a regular basis, and
to increase them as their payment capacity
improves.

The technical group on Sudan’s
external debt (TWG) co-chaired by the Fund
and the Bank was created in late 2010 to
advance the technical work on debt relief.
Since then it met five times. It facilitated the

Prior to South Sudan’s secession, the two countries had
reached an agreement on the so-called “zero option,” under
which Sudan would retain all the external liabilities after the
secession of South Sudan, provided that: (i) South Sudan
joined Sudan in outreach efforts for debt relief for Sudan, and
(ii) the international community gave firm commitments to
the delivery of debt relief within two years. Absent such a
commitment by July 2013, Sudan’s debt would be
apportioned between the two countries.

by the Parliament in late June 2012. The

54.
The authorities expressed an interest
in a successor SMP. Staff pointed out that the
recent economic measures could form the
basis for initiating discussions on a SMP. These
discussions could start later this year.

53.
Sudan’s current statistical database
is broadly adequate for surveillance and
program monitoring, but needs further
improvements. Staff urged the authorities to
enhance the status and resources of the
Central Bureau of Statistics, giving the Bureau
the authority to produce and disseminate
official statistics and coordinate the national
statistical work program.

STAFF APPRAISAL
55.
Against the backdrop of internal
tensions and conflicts, Sudan managed in
the past 15 years to promote economic
growth and improve economic conditions.
The 2011 Assessment of Engagement Under the
SMPs confirmed Sudan’s satisfactory
macroeconomic performance and its progress
on key structural reforms under successive
SMPs.
56.
The secession of South Sudan has
translated into a severe economic shock
that resulted in the loss of a sizeable
portion of the country’s economic potential
and international payment capacity. To deal
16

These include rationing foreign exchange and earmarking
it to selected sectors, and introducing restrictions on banks’
excess reserves in foreign currency with the central bank and
on bank deposits in foreign currency.

appropriately with this shock, staff encourages
the authorities to: (i) stabilize the
macroeconomy in the near term; and (ii) over
the medium term recalibrate the economy in
line with the country’s reduced economic and
financial potential. In view of Sudan’s limited
access to international markets, this strategy
will need to rely mainly on domestic resources.
57.
The authorities’ reform program and
the underlying policy mix is a positive step
towards consolidating economic conditions
and curbing inflation. Over the mediumterm, the challenge remains to sustain these
adjustment efforts in order to regenerate most
of the lost economic potential by gradually
building a more competitive and self-reliant
economy.

Staff welcomes the policies
underlying the revised 2012 budget. It
commends the authorities’ decision to
substantially reduce fuel subsidies, and
strongly supports the reinforcement of the
social safety nets and the marked reduction in
non-priority spending. On the revenue side,
staff considers the increase in tax rates as
appropriate given the pressing need to
mobilize revenues, but urges the authorities to
step up efforts to widen the tax base.
59.
Staff urges the authorities to
develop a medium-term budget framework,
to strengthen budgetary execution and
control, and to overhaul and reform state
finances. Staff recommends enhancing tax
policy and revenue administration by reducing
tax exemptions and improving tax compliance.
Given the government’s leading role as the
wage setter in the economy, it advises linking
the average wage in the civil service to the
nonoil economy’s productivity, a measure that
would gradually boost competitiveness and
improve the external trade balance. Staff also
encourages the authorities to pursue the
phasing-out of subsidies and develop a well
targeted safety net system. It also
recommends imposing a profit tax on gold
producers as the sector develops.
60.
Enhancing the effectiveness of
monetary policy necessitates a better
coordination between the monetary and
fiscal authorities. Bringing inflation under
control will require greater de facto central
bank independence in order to contain and
gradually reduce the monetization of the fiscal
deficit.
61.
Staff underscores the importance of
enhancing monetary management at the
CBOS. Staff recommends using reserve money
as an anchor to tighten credit to the
government and ensure sufficient credit to the
24

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

private sector, eventually bringing inflation
under control. Noting the systemic nature of
bank excess liquidity, it recommends refraining
from raising the reserve requirements ratio as
the latter is largely ineffective, and could only
adversely affect banking intermediation and
profitability. To restore the monetary
transmission mechanism, staff advises the
CBOS to provide the commercial banks with
the appropriate opportunities to recycle their
unused deposit liabilities, which could be
achieved through the organization of a
competitive auction system of CBOS own
securities.
62.
The authorities' step devaluation of
the official exchange rate is welcome. staff
notes that the commercial banks rate is less
overvalued than other official rates and is thus
closer to market conditions. Staff strongly
recommends to unify the existing four official
rates and to extend the commercial banks rate
to all transactions. Staff advises, however, that
greater exchange rate flexibility will be an
important element in facilitating the required
adjustment and safeguarding foreign
exchange reserves. It encourages the
authorities to end the use of the premium
incentive practice and gradually repeal all the
existing administrative restrictions.
63.
Stepping up structural reforms will
help address the underlying structural
challenges facing the economy. Key reforms
include: (i) a comprehensive civil service
reform, (ii) banking sector restructuring,
(iii) ambitious privatization program, and
(iv) improving governance.
64.
Sudan is in debt distress and its
arrears continue to constrain access to
external financing. The authorities should
continue to contain the contracting or
guaranteeing of non concessional external
borrowing, and reach out to donors to garner

SUDAN

support for debt relief. Staff encourages the
authorities to continue to strengthen their
cooperation with the Fund on policies and
payments.
65.
The support of the international
community is critical to the success of
Sudan’s reform strategy. Its absence could
jeopardize the maturing of the economy, cap
its growth potential, and worsen its poverty
profile. Staff strongly encourages the
authorities to enhance their dialogue with

2012 ARTICLE IV REPORT

creditors and donors. Also, the authorities’
implementation of sound macroeconomic
policies would be critical in catalyzing much
needed support by assuring donors that their
resources are being put to effective use.
66.
It is recommended that the next
Article IV Consultation with Sudan takes place
on the standard 12-month cycle.

Exchange Rate Arrangement
The legal tender is the Sudanese guinea, which
replaced the Sudanese dinar in proportion
SDG 1=SDD 100 in mid-2007. After the
completion of a currency conversion to the
new Sudanese guinea the Bank of Sudan (BOS)
has allowed greater exchange rate flexibility
than in 2006 and early 2007, suggesting a
return to a floating exchange rate
arrangement. Sudan maintains (i) an exchange
restriction and a multiple currency practice
arising from the imposition by the government
of a cash margin requirement for most imports
and (ii) an exchange restriction arising from
the imposition of an absolute ceiling on
foreign exchange for travel, subject to Fund
approval under Article VIII, Sections 2(a) and 3.
These restrictions were approved by the Board
to end-June 2010. In addition, Sudan has
recently introduced additional exchange
measures and staff is currently assessing these
measures to determine their compliance with
Article VIII.

SUDAN

ANNEX II. SUDAN: RELATIONS WITH THE WORLD
BANK
(As of July 31, 2012)
1.
The World Bank’s International
Development Association (IDA) has no active
lending portfolio in Sudan because of the
country’s default on its financial obligations to
IDA, which led to the suspension of
disbursements in April 1993. After discussions
between the World Bank and the Sudanese
authorities on the need for Sudan to take steps
toward normalizing its relations and
establishing a track record with the World
Bank, the authorities have been making small,
intermittent debt service payments since mid1999. The amount of payments has not been
sufficient to prevent a continued accumulation
of arrears, which currently stand at about
US$ 695.6 million and are growing.
2.
The World Bank was a major player in
the reconstruction of Sudan following the
Addis Ababa peace agreement of 1972, but
was mostly absent from Sudan between 1993
and 2002. As the prospects for peace with the
South rose in 2003, the World Bank formulated
a strategy for a potential reengagement.
Following the signing of the Comprehensive
Peace Agreement (CPA) on January 9, 2005 by
the Government of Sudan and the Sudan
People’s Liberation Movement, the World Bank
became the administrator for two large MultiDonor Trust Funds (MDTFs) that support the
CPA, and built up its program of non-lending
support. Fifteen MDTF partners1 have
1

Partners having paid in funds to the MDTFs are:
Netherlands, Norway, United Kingdom, European
Commission, Canada, Sweden, Germany, Finland,
Spain, Denmark, Italy, Egypt, Iceland, Greece, and the
World Bank. The World Bank contributed (from IBRD
surplus) US$5 million to each of the MDTFs.

6

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

contributed US$ 790 million in paid-in funds to
the MDTFs. MDTF-supported projects initially
experienced implementation challenges, as
have all development and recovery programs
in Sudan, but performance has steadily
improved. Significant results are being seen
on the ground, including the successful MDTFsupported launch of the CPA-mandated new
national currency and the completion of the
5th Population Census, though daunting
challenges remain—most notably low capacity,
especially at the state level and in the South.
3.
The World Bank’s Interim Strategy
Note (ISN) for Sudan was discussed by the
World Bank’s Board in April 2008. The ISN aims
to support the Government of National Unity
and the Government of Southern Sudan to
sustain peace and reduce conflict by meeting
the commitments contained in the CPA, Darfur
Peace Agreement, and the Eastern Sudan
Peace Agreement—particularly in war-affected
and marginalized areas and in the fields of
governance, basic services, and pro-poor
economic growth. The ISN aims to help Sudan
take important steps toward the achievement
of the longer-term strategic vision enshrined in
the CPA: promoting peace in Sudan by making
it attractive through development, shared
prosperity, and a reformed system of
governance which serves all Sudanese.
4.
The entry points for World Bank
support—through management of the MDTFs
and non-lending activities—vary according to
the diverse conditions facing different regions
of Sudan. At the National level, a focus on
stabilizing peace entails a major role for

SUDAN

analytical work and policy dialogue on
implementing key provisions of the CPA (propoor growth, good governance and
decentralization, empowerment), and—in the
Three Areas and the East—on pro-peace
development projects and building capacity
for community-driven development and local
service delivery. In Darfur, the World Bank
works with partners, as security allows, to
assess development and recovery needs and
to make ready rehabilitation and development
programs to be implemented in the event of
peace. In the South, the main focus is on
helping to build a competent, responsive and
stable government based on good
governance, rule of law, and transparency,
while promoting efforts to empower and
decentralize service delivery to the states,
counties, and communities. Another key
objective is to help Southern Sudan develop a
long-term strategy to transform itself into a
well-integrated, self-reliant, and viable
economic unit that begins to harness its vast
and rich natural resources for the welfare of its
people. The substantial financial support
through the MDTFs and the World Bank’s
analytical and advisory services will be
mobilized to meet these objectives.
5.
With national elections recently
completed, the focus of CPA implementation is
now on preparations for the referendum in
Southern Sudan due in early 2011.
6.
IDA’s financial reengagement requires
clearance of Sudan’s outstanding arrears. The
clearance of these arrears can only be
undertaken once a firm and comprehensive
agreement among preferred creditors is in
place. Such an agreement would also include

2012 ARTICLE IV REPORT—INFORMATIONAL ANNEX

significant reductions in bilateral debts, so as
to make the total debt service obligations
sustainable. Following the eventual clearance
of IDA arrears, an exceptional IDA allocation
for Sudan as a post-conflict country would be
sought, and the World Bank would prepare
another strategy document which would
include, inter alia, a pipeline of projects.
7.
The World Bank has completed a series
of major non-lending products since the CPA,
including a Public Expenditure Review,
Diagnostic Trade Integration Study (on behalf
of its Integrated Framework partners) and
most recently a Country Economic
Memorandum on sustainable and broadbased growth. Major non-lending products
planned to be completed and delivered by the
end of calendar 2010 include an Investment
Climate Assessment focusing on the needs of
small firms, an Environment and Natural
Resources study, a Country Integrated
Fiduciary Assessment, and for Southern Sudan
studies on strengthening good governance
and on States’ own revenue potential.
To enrich this menu of policy and analytical
support, the World Bank will seek to deepen
dialogue—and open up space for civil society
participation in such dialogue—in areas such
as: developing a Darfur reconstruction and
development strategy; making decentralization
work; transforming Southern Sudan into an
integrated and viable economic unit; and local
area development. The World Bank’s Financial
Market Integrity Unit will continue its technical
support to build capacity to combat money
laundering through a proposed multi-phase
program.

ANNEX III. SUDAN: RELATIONS WITH THE AFRICAN
DEVELOPMENT BANK
(As of July 31, 2012)
Group’s Portfolio and Arrears
1.
Since its first intervention in 1971 in
Sudan, the Bank Group (AfDB) has approved to
date 33 operations amounting to a total net
commitment of UA291 million.1 The Bank also
approved grants for emergency assistance
under the Special Relief Fund in 2001, 2003
and 2008 amounting to a total of USD2.0
million. In terms of sector distribution, the
portfolio is dominated by agriculture (54%),
followed by infrastructure (28.6%), multi sector
(8.9%), finance (6%) and social sectors (2.5%).
2.
The Bank ongoing operation is the
Institutional Capacity Building for Poverty
Reduction and Good Governance Project
(ICBPRGGP), approved in March 2007 for
US$15 million in the form of a grant. Expected
to be closed by end-2012, a major
accomplishment of the ICBPRGGP was the
completion in 2010 of the Sudan Baseline

The Bank has maintained field
presence and sustained policy dialogue with
the Government of Sudan and Development
Partners. It has conducted technical assistance
and capacity building activities, using grant
resources that are not affected by the arrears
situation of the country.
5.
Given the arrears situation of Sudan,
the Country Brief serves as the appropriate
programming document. The last Country
Brief was approved in November 2010. The
new Country Brief 2012/2013 is under
preparation, based on the Interim Poverty
Reduction Strategy Paper 2011-2013. It is
expected to be presented to the Board in
September 2012. Sudan is eligible to resources
of ADF-12 (2011-2013) and the Supplemental
Support Window (Pillar 1) of the Fragile States
Facility (FSF), conditional upon arrears
clearance.

In the last couple of years, the Bank’s
strategic engagement with Sudan has focused

SUDAN

on: (i) accelerating a peaceful settlement of
critical post-referendum economic issues with
South-Sudan, by providing technical assistance
to the African Union High-Level
Implementation Panel (AUHIP); (ii) technical
assistance, capacity building and donor
coordination aimed at accelerating the process
arrears clearance and debt relief for the
reengagement of Sudan with the international
community; and (iii) sustaining dialogue and
conducting analytical work to prepare the
ground for effective full-fledged support in
addressing the development challenges of
Sudan.

ANNEX IV. SUDAN: STATISTICAL ISSUES
(As of July 31, 2012)
Assessment of Data Adequacy for Surveillance
General: Sudan’s current statistical data base appears broadly adequate for surveillance and
program monitoring, but needs further improvements, including upgrading the base year,
coverage, periodicity and timeliness of national accounts data; improving labor market and direct
investment data; and more detailed and comprehensive fiscal accounting. Enhancing the status
of the Central Bureau of Statistics (CBS) with the authority and resources to compile and
disseminate official statistics and coordinate the national statistical work program is important
for further statistical improvements, and should be addressed within the context of the ongoing
work in developing a five-year National Strategy for the Development of Statistics (2012-16).
Retooling of the CBS’ computing infrastructure should also be accorded high priority.
National accounts: The CBS lacks a comprehensive data collection program, and relies largely
on administrative reporting which is not optimal for national accounts compilation. Economic
surveys were last conducted in the 1970s and 1980s, and the benchmarks derived from these
surveys inform current estimates of value added. The compilation of GDP by activity depends
heavily on indirect indicators of growth rates and price indicators that are less appropriate.
Informal activities are not covered, and are likely to be significant in areas such as retail trade and
construction. Sudan’s national accounts data are based on the System of National Accounts 1968
(SNA 1968), and the base year of the existing GDP constant price series (by activity and by
expenditure) is 1981. National accounts statistics are compiled with a lag exceeding three years;
and there are no national accounts or industrial production data at sub annual frequencies. On
the expenditure side, data are lacking on final consumption by households, investment, and
changes in stocks.
The adoption of updated statistical guidelines (SNA 2008), rebasing of the national accounts, and
developing procedures to improve the timeliness of GDP estimates should be among the core
medium-term objectives of Sudan’s national accounts work program. There is an urgent need to
increase funding to the CBS and to rebuild its capacity for conducting household, agricultural
and enterprise surveys.
Price statistics: Practices in the production of the Consumer Price Index (CPI) are good. Monthly
CPI data (base year=2007) are provided shortly after the end of each month. However, the CBS
should begin developing plans for a new household expenditure survey to facilitate weight
updates to the existing CPI. The CBS is developing for the first time, a quarterly producer price
index (PPI) for manufactured goods. STA’s recent multisector statistics mission (April 2012)
conducted a preliminary assessment of the methods and procedures for compiling the PPI; and
issues regarding the frame and the sample size were raised with the authorities. The mission also
advised on how the base year weights would need to be adjusted to reflect the reduced
contributions of oil to the Sudan economy.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

SUDAN

2012 ARTICLE IV REPORT—INFORMATIONAL ANNEX

Government finance statistics: Government finance statistics reported to MCD are broadly
adequate for program monitoring, with the main revenue, expenditure, and financing items
reported on a monthly basis with a lag of about one month. The reported statistics are for the
central government only, and do not include the states and publicly owned corporations. Data
are submitted using an economic classification and, while the allocation of resources by MOFNE
to the various ministries is reported, their actual expenditures are not.
STA’s recent multisector statistics mission (April 2012) noted that there has been no significant
progress in implementing GFS classifications at the level of state governments and all other subnational governments and extra budgetary funds. The responsibility for GFS compilation and
dissemination is not assigned to any specific unit within the MOFNE. The mission also found that
there are no comprehensive data reconciliations on government claims on and liabilities to the
banking system; and the recording of “arrears securities” is not in line with the GFSM guidelines.
The compilation of consolidated GFS for the general government with the objective of producing
the statement of government operations should be a key priority.
Monetary and financial statistics (MFS): Sudan has received significant technical assistance to
improve the collection, compilation, and dissemination of monetary and financial statistics. STA’s
recent multisector statistics mission (2012) found that all major recommendations made by the
previous MFS mission in 2007 have been implemented. The current coverage of Sudan’s
monetary statistics includes the CBOS and 32 commercial banks, which constitute the other
depository corporations (ODCs). Due to South Sudan’s secession, the Bank of South Sudan
(BOSS) and the conventional banks operating in South Sudan were excluded from the coverage
of the CBOS and the ODCs, respectively, beginning with July 2011 data. The revised monthly
statistical return has been used by all commercial banks to report data for compiling monetary
statistics. However, stronger efforts are needed to improve the consistency in reporting of interbank data and the timeliness of data reporting and dissemination. The STA 2012 mission also
identified areas for further improvement.
Going forward, the CBOS should also develop a work program for collecting and compiling data
on insurance corporations and pension funds for inclusion in Sudan’s monetary statistics.
External sector statistics: Daily exchange rate data are posted on the CBOS’ web page with
minimal lags. There are several areas for improvement in the external accounts, particularly with
regard to direct investment (DI), remittances, goods and services, capital transfers and oil
statistics. The lack of survey data continues to affect the compilation of important balance of
payments and IIP items such as direct investment. The BOS’s foreign exchange balances include
reserves earmarked for particular purposes such as medicine, oil, and spare part imports, but the
composition of these reserves and their potential usability in the event of a balance of payment
need is not clear There is a need for clarification on items that qualify as reserves assets in
general, and those earmarked reserves in particular. Compilation of the data template on
international reserves and foreign currency liquidity should be initiated.
Medium-term oil production projections and data on amortization of private sector debt need
substantial improvement. The authorities have made some progress in improving oil projections,
but appear reluctant to provide more detailed information on the phasing-in and expected

production levels of new blocks and on amortization of debt in the oil sector.
STA’s recent multisector statistics mission assisted the CBOS in improving the compilation of a
number of balance of payments and IIP items, including in particular, the calculation of reserve
asset positions that were incorrectly recorded with a negative sign for some months in 2011. The
mission also advised on the treatment of external debt arrears in the balance of payments and
the IIP, and recommended steps for initiating the collection of data on capital transfers. METAC is
providing ongoing support in the implementation of the DI survey.
Data Standards and Quality
Sudan participates in the General Data Dissemination System (GDDS) since August 2003. GDDS
metadata and plans for improvement need to be updated. No data ROSC is available.
Reporting to STA
Annual data reported for the Government Finance Statistics Yearbook cover only budgetary
central government up to 1999. No monthly and quarterly fiscal data are reported for the
International Financial Statistics (IFS). The reporting of external trade statistics for inclusion in the
Direction of Trade Statistics (DOTS) database is done with significant lags. National accounts data
are not provided for publication in the IFS. The CBOS has compiled and reported to STA for
publication in the IFS, the Standardized Report Forms (SRFs) 1SR for the central bank and 2SR for
ODCs. However, timeliness of data reporting and dissemination should be improved. The CBOS
also reports to STA, quarterly balance of payments and annual IIP data. As a follow up the STA’s
recent multisector statistics mission, the authorities should submit updated GDDS metadata for
dissemination on the Dissemination Standards Bulletin Board.

STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2012 ARTICLE IV
CONSULTATION—DEBT SUSTAINABILITYANALYSIS

September 7, 2012

Approved By

Adnan Mazarei and
Christian Mumssen (IMF)
and Jeffrey D. Lewis (IDA)

Prepared by the staffs of the International Monetary Fund
(IMF) and the International Development Association (IDA)

The 2012 debt sustainability analysis (DSA) confirms that Sudan continues to be in debt
distress.1 External and domestic debt ratios have continued to worsen owing to further
accumulation of new external arrears, increased domestic borrowing and the permanent
deterioration of macroeconomic fundamentals after the secession of South Sudan in
July 2011. Debt dynamics under the baseline scenario are projected to remain
unfavorable—with all debt ratios but one breaching their indicative thresholds even
through the long term. It will thus be critical for Sudan to follow sound economic policies
consistent with a prudent borrowing strategy, and to garner support for debt relief.

1

The DSA was prepared jointly by IMF and World Bank staffs and discussed with the authorities. It uses the joint Fund-Bank
Low-Income Country (LIC) Debt Sustainability Framework (DSF). Sudan’s fiscal year runs from January 1 to December 31.

2012 ARTICLE IV REPORT—DEBT SUSTAINABILITY ANALYSIS SUDAN

BACKGROUND
1.
2011 marks a watershed for Sudan. The secession of South Sudan has translated into a sharp
contraction of Sudan’s revenue and export base, exacerbating an already difficult economic situation. This
permanent shock is severely affecting Sudan’s macroeconomic outlook, sharply reducing its debt servicing
capacity. Prior to South Sudan’s secession, the two countries have reached an agreement on the so-called
zero option, under which Sudan would retain all the external liabilities after the secession of South Sudan,
provided that (i) South Sudan joined Sudan in outreach efforts for debt relief for Sudan, and (ii) the
international community gave firm commitments to the delivery of debt relief within two years from the
secession. Absent such a commitment by July 2013, Sudan’s external debt would be apportioned based on
a formula to be determined. Agreement on any debt apportionment, however, would likely require a
consensus view from Sudan’s entire pool of creditors, which spans multilateral, Paris Club bilateral, nonParis Club bilateral, and commercial lenders. This would require extensive negotiations and may prove to
be very difficult.
2.
Sudan is potentially eligible for debt relief under different initiatives—including the Heavily
Indebted Poor Countries Initiative (HIPC) Initiative, since it is included in the list of ring-fenced countries.
Sudan has made good progress toward finalizing the technical work required to advance towards the
decision point of the HIPC Initiative. The government has taken three important steps: (i) it has reconciled
over 90 percent of the end-2010 external debt stock in collaboration with creditors; (ii) Parliament has
approved an ambitious interim-PRSP in June 2012; and (iii) Sudan has implemented 13 Staff-Monitored
Programs (SMPs) with the Fund since 1997, establishing a sound track record of cooperation on economic
policies and payments. Furthermore, Sudan has indicated its desire to continue demonstrating a strong
commitment to cooperation with the Fund on policies and the payment of arrears, also formally in the
framework of a new SMP (for which negotiations could start later this year). Meanwhile, the government is
collaborating with the World Bank on an Interim Strategy Note, which would determine the development
objectives for the next two years.
3.
Re-engagement with key development partners is a necessary step towards a
comprehensive arrears clearance and debt relief strategy. This is important because even after
traditional debt relief according to Paris Club Naples Terms,2 HIPC Initiative and debt relief under the
Multilateral Debt Relief Initiative (MDRI) on remaining eligible debt of IDA and the African Development
Fund (AfDF),3 Sudan will likely be left with a sizeable stock of external debt. This debt will either need to be

2

Paris Club members provide a reduction of pre-cutoff date bilateral non-official development assistance and commercial debt up
to 67 percent in present value terms. Other non-multilateral creditors generally join with comparable actions.
3

MDRI is provided by the IDA, AfDF, and IMF at the HIPC Initiative’s completion point. Eligible for MDRI assistance are debt
obligations contracted before end-December 2003 for IDA and end-December 2004 for the IMF and AfDB that are still outstanding
at the HIPC Initiative’s completion point date. All of Sudan’s current debt to IDA and the AFDF qualifies for MDRI since it has been
contracted prior to the cut-off date.

serviced or addressed through further debt relief (MDRI-like4 or beyond-HIPC debt relief).5 It thus
remains critical to secure comprehensive support from the international community for debt relief.
The qualification for debt relief will be announced at the appropriate time.

STRUCTURE OF DEBT
EXTERNAL DEBT
4.
At end-2011, Sudan’s stock of external debt amounted to about US$41.5 billion in nominal
terms (65 percent of GDP), of which 84 percent was in arrears (Figure 1 and Table 4). The structure of
external debt had not changed since the early 2000s. The bulk of the external debt is public and publicly
guaranteed (PPG) (adding to US$39.9 billion, with 87 percent in arrears). From this total, Sudan owns
73 percent to bilateral creditors (roughly equally divided between Paris and non-Paris Club creditors) and
13 percent to multilateral and commercial creditors. Private external debt to suppliers amounted to
US$1.6 billion.

5.
The present value (PV) of Sudan’s total external PPG debt at end-2011 stood at
US$71 billion, or the equivalent of 112 percent of GDP, 605 percent of exports and 625 percent of
revenues (Table 4). Note that the 2012 deterioration of almost all external debt indicator ratios is a
denominator effect, reflecting the sharp drop in GDP, exports and government revenues as a result of the
secession, as well as the substantial currency depreciation.6

4

None of Sudan’s debt to the Fund would be eligible for MDRI debt relief. However, following the approach developed for Liberia’s
debt relief, “MDRI-like” debt relief could be provided if the necessary financing is secured at the appropriate time.”
5

Paris Club members can provide debt relief on a voluntary basis.

6

The official rate was depreciated by 66 percent at end-June alone, which explains the large residual BOP financing in 2012 (also
see footnote 3 in Table 4).

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND 3

2012 ARTICLE IV REPORT—DEBT SUSTAINABILITY ANALYSIS SUDAN

6.
The core of Sudan’s debt strategy was to keep new nonconcessional external borrowing
under the US$700 million ceiling in line with the last SMP. In 2010 and 2011, Sudan indeed only
contracted US$419 and US$857 million of new PPG loans, of which 64 and 77 percent, respectively, were
nonconcessional. New debt was mainly directed to projects in the agriculture, services and energy sector
(Table 1) and mainly provided by either multilateral or non-Paris Club creditors (Table 2). There has not
been any new private external debt in decades.

7.
Repayments on outstanding debt continued to a few selected creditors giving new loans,
leading to a further accumulation of external arrears. For some time now, debt repayment has been
partial even in the case of creditors providing new loans. In 2010 and 2011, Sudan’s total actual PPG debt
service amounted to US$395 and 288 million, respectively, which only partially covered total due PPG debt
service of US$2.2 and 2.1 billion (including late interest and penalties on arrears). The PPG disbursements
amounted to US$575 and 606 million, respectively, and no private external debt was serviced.

DOMESTIC PUBLIC DEBT
8.
Domestic public debt is relatively small (11.5 percent of GDP at end-2011), but has been
increasing. It increased from SDG 2.1 billion in 2000 to SDG 6.3 billion in 2005 and SDG 19.8 billion
in 2011, mainly due to primary deficits continuously financed by domestic resources. In 2011, about
66 percent of domestic debt arose from medium-term obligations, while long- and short-term debt
accounted for 19 and 15 percent of total, respectively.

TOTAL PUBLIC DEBT
9.
All in all, total public debt continued to increase in recent years. It reached SDG137 billion
(74 percent of GDP) at end-2011, from SDG65 billion in 2005, and SDG49 billion in 2000 (Figure 2). This
increase in total public debt was mainly the result of an increase in the stock of debt denominated in
foreign currency, including a devaluation effect. Hence, at end-2011, the PV of public sector debt-to-GDP
ratio stood at 124 percent of GDP (Table 6).

UNDERLYING ASSUMPTIONS
10.
This DSA reflects the secession-induced reduction of Sudan’s economic potential, whilst
extrapolating the current debt dynamics (Box 1). Data underlying this DSA was provided by the
Sudanese authorities or estimated and projected by Fund and World Bank staffs. The external debt data
for 2010 and onwards were reconciled with information obtained during the 2011 debt reconciliation
exercise. This DSA refrains from presenting alternative scenarios based on speculations about the
magnitude of possible external debt relief (which are crucially dependent on export prospects that are
currently very volatile) or apportionment settlement between Sudan and South Sudan.
11.
The macroeconomic and debt outlooks underlying this DSA differ widely from the previous
DSA. This difference is mainly on account of: (i) substantially deteriorated post-secession fundamentals;
(ii) natural resource projections accounting for the post-secession oil potential and the sharp increase of
gold exploitation; (iii) updated debt evolution based on the reconciled end-2010 debt stock; and
(iv) assumption of Sudan remaining current on debt service falling due on disbursed outstanding debt
(DOD), and not on the creditors that still disburse only. Ample exploration studies on the country’s mineral
deposits are currently under way that might change the natural resource outlook in future DSAs.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND 5

2012 ARTICLE IV REPORT—DEBT SUSTAINABILITY ANALYSIS SUDAN

Box 1. Macroeconomic Assumptions 2012–32
Natural resources. With the secession-induced loss of ¾ of oil production, the oil sector’s dominance of
the Sudanese economy abated significantly. Oil now accounts for only 3 to 5 percent of GDP, 20 to
25 percent of government revenue, and 35 to 40 percent of exports. At the same time, there has been an
increase in gold production, with gold exports having tripled since 2009.
- The production outlook is informed by discussions with the Ministries of Oil and Mining. As for oil,
owing to waning mature fields (higher quality Nile blend) and other technical production problems, 2012
production is expected to sharply decline by 60 percent to 117 to 120 thousand barrels per day (bpd).
Enhanced recovery in existing fields and further exploration will likely help production to increase again
starting in 2013, with a peak expected in 2020 at near 240 thousand bpd, before a gradual decline to
about 144 thousand bpd begins in 2030. Meanwhile, annual production of gold is projected to increase
by 3 percent per year until 2020 and to decline by 3 percent after 2026.
- The price outlook is guided by the IMF’s latest World Economic Outlook (WEO) figures for the medium
term and the World Bank’s Commodity Market Review for the longer term. Overall, prices are expected
to remain stable and average around US$83 per barrel for Sudanese crude over the medium term before
settling to around US$79 per barrel in the longer term.
Real sector. The real GDP growth rate is expected to gradually increase to 4.2 percent until 2017 and then
to average 4.6 percent over 2018–32. Given the smaller post-secession oil sector, real GDP growth will
mainly reflect non-oil GDP growth in the presence of renewed macroeconomic stabilization, new attempts
at structural reform and finance-constrained low infrastructure investments. Inflation, as measured by the
GDP deflator, is a projected to grow in line with CPI inflation over the long term, implying stable terms of
trade. After averaging 13.6 percent over the medium term, inflation will gradually come down to 6 percent
by 2032.
Fiscal sector and domestic debt. The projected fiscal deficit averages 2.3 percent of GDP during the
period 2012–17, reflecting a combination of factors, including: (i) some improvements in tax revenue
collection; (ii) a progressive increase in oil revenues; (iii) the continuation of current public wage and
employment policies; (ii) a gradual phasing out of fuel subsidies; (iv) slight decrease of current spending
shares on transfers to states; and (v) rising capital expenditure outlays. During 2018–32, the fiscal deficit is
expected to average some 2.6 percent of GDP, reflecting (i) a gradual increase in tax revenues, against the
backdrop of decreasing oil revenues, (ii) the continuation of current expenditure policies, and (iii) increasing
interest payments. Owing to continued limited access to international financing, the projected budget
deficit wills will be financed mostly domestically, assuming no further accumulation of arrears.
External sector and financing. The balance of payments is expected to benefit of export growth
until 2020 and then to gradually contract, mainly on account of a continued dominance of natural resource
exports and limited prospects for the development of other exports, and the maintenance of limited
foreign direct investment, aid inflows and access to international financing. These assumptions lead to a
decline over time in the current account deficit (incl. official transfers), a contraction in the reserves
coverage, and an import coverage averaging 3.1 percent of GDP or 2 months of imports over 2018–32.
External debt. Reflecting continued limited access to international finance and a deteriorating debt service
capacity, disbursements of new loans are projected at about 1.3 percent of GDP during 2012–17, and
1.2 percent during 2018–32. In line with the recent portfolio of new contracted debt, the share of new
concessional loans is kept at around one third. Starting in 2012, Sudan is assumed to remain current on
scheduled debt service on disbursed outstanding debt (including new borrowing), but continue to fail to
service obligations arising from the stock of arrears (i.e., late interest and penalties as well as arrears
themselves).

SUDAN 2012 ARTICLE IV REPORT—DEBT SUSTAINABILITY ANALYSIS

EXTERNAL SECTOR DSA
BASELINE SCENARIO
12.
In the baseline scenario, the outcome for the main debt ratios continues to show a sustained
breach of indicative thresholds for poor performers.7 well into 2032—even substantially worse than
in the 2010 DSA (Figure 3, Tables 3 and 4). This worsening of the debt ratios is due mainly to the
secession-induced deterioration in fundamentals and to the more complete external debt portfolio
compiled at the 2011 reconciliation exercise. Going forward after a denominator-driven deterioration
in 2012, external debt indicators persist at very high levels primarily because of the growing stock of arrears
rather than because of new debt. In the long term, all external debt indicator ratios (except those relating to
collapsing exports) exhibit a declining trend (Figure 1). They remain nevertheless well above the policydependent debt burden thresholds. The only exception is the debt service-to-revenue ratio which shows
some improvement towards the end of the projected period. This improvement must be interpreted with
caution, however, since the DSA does not assume any external arrears clearance strategy and timeline.

According to the World Bank Country Policy and Institutions Assessment (CPIA), Sudan is classified as a country with poor quality
of policies and institutions. Its average CPIA rating for 2009–11 is 2.42 on a scale from 1 to 6 and below the operational cutoff of
3.25 for medium performers.

ALTERNATIVE SCENARIO AND BOUND TESTS
13.
The alternative scenario8 and standard stress tests to the baseline scenario confirm the
robustness of the baseline scenario and thus of the debt distress rating for Sudan. More specifically,
the findings are:


The alternative scenario (Table 5, Scenario A1) is a financing scenario that points to Sudan’s
external debt not being very vulnerable to new public loan terms (i.e. a 2 percentage points
higher interest rate). Relative to the baseline, all debt burden indicators would only marginally
deteriorate. The reason is that Sudan’s debt dynamics are driven more by the massive stock of
arrears than the burden of contracting new debt.



The bound tests (Table 5, Scenarios B1 to B6) corroborate Sudan’s vulnerability to a range of
unexpected external shocks. The PV of debt-to-GDP, PV of debt-to-revenue and debt service-torevenue ratios turn out to be most vulnerable to a One-time depreciation shock than the PV of
debt-to-exports and debt service-to-exports ratio to an exports shock.

PUBLIC SECTOR DSA
BASELINE SCENARIO
14.
In the baseline scenario, debt stock and service indicators under the total public DSA mirror
those under the external DSA (Figure 4 and Table 6).9 In 2012, owing to the sharp currency depreciation,
the PV of public sector debt-to-GDP ratio jumps to a relatively high level at over 180 percent, before
declining over the medium term to reach about 156 percent in 2017. These results are due to the projected
strengthening in real GDP growth and the reduction in the fiscal deficit envisaged in the 2013–17
projections. The debt service-to-revenue ratio is projected to only decline from 42 to 36 percent
between 2012 and the end of the projection horizon.

ALTERNATIVE SCENARIO AND BOUND TESTS
15.
The alternative scenario and standard stress tests to the baseline scenario support the robustness
of the baseline scenario. In particular:


The alternative scenarios (Table 7, Scenarios A1-A3) highlight that Sudan’s public debt
sustainability depends on improving its fiscal soundness and growth potential, particularly in the

8

This DSA does not show the historical scenario, in which the main variables that determine debt dynamics (namely, real GDP
growth; inflation, measured by changes in the U.S. dollar GDP deflator; the non-interest external current account in percent of GDP;
and non-debt-creating flows in percent of GDP) are usually assumed to remain at their 10-year historical averages. The reason is
that secession-induced structural breaks in the time series undermine the validity of the historical scenario.

9

The 2012 level of the public debt stock indicators (PV of debt-to-GDP and PV of debt-to-revenue) is substantially higher than
those reported last year. This upward jump reflects adverse developments in both external debt (the buildup in external arrears and
the contraction of new external loans)—and domestic debt and the further accumulation of sizeable domestic arrears in 2012.

non-oil economy. The no reform scenario (A2), where the primary balance is projected to remain
unchanged from the relatively high 2012 level, points to the vulnerability of Sudan’s public debt
trajectory to large fiscal imbalances. The PV of debt-to-GDP and debt service-to-revenue ratios
for 2032 would be 89 and 34 percent, respectively. However, a permanently lower GDP growth
(A3) would bring even more diversion from the baseline, leaving the PV of debt-to-GDP and
debt service-to-revenue ratios for 2032 at over 120 and 50 percent, respectively.


The bound tests (Table 7, Scenarios B1-B5) point to a one-time 30 percent real depreciation
in 2013 (B4) giving rise to the worst scenario for all three debt indicators. The PV of debt-to-GDP
and the PV of debt-to-revenue would be almost 130 and over 1100 percent in 2032. The debt
service-to-revenue ratio would increase to 56 percent in 2032.

CONCLUSION
16.
Sudan remains in debt distress. All external debt burden ratios remain well above the indicative
thresholds (except for the debt service-to-revenue ratio at the end of the projection horizon) during the
projection period. In addition, the overall public sector debt dynamics remain unsustainable in light of the
current size and projected dynamics of the domestic debt stock. Even after traditional and HIPC Initiative
assistance, Sudan is likely to be left with a sizeable external debt, which will either need to be serviced or
addressed through further assistance (such as Paris Club “beyond HIPC” bilateral debt relief, Multilateral
Debt Relief Initiative (MDRI) or MDRI-like debt relief). The risk rating therefore remains unchanged with
respect to the previous 2010 DSA.
17.
Prudent public debt and macro policies, especially under a successor SMP, are critical to
secure access to possible debt relief under the Enhanced HIPC Initiative and MDRI. Sudan’s debt
strategy should continue to focus on avoiding reliance on nonconcessional borrowing, securing external
support on highly concessional terms, and increasing the grant element of external borrowing received to
finance necessary development and infrastructure expenditures. Recourse to non-concessional borrowing
further increases the future debt burden, undermining debt sustainability even after possible debt relief. To
effectively address the vulnerabilities highlighted in the DSA, Sudan should focus on strengthening its
external and fiscal stance and on providing a more stable political and business environment.

1/ The secession-induced structural breaks in the time series undermine the historical scenario, which is therefore omitted from the table.
2/ Assumes that the interest rate on new borrowing is by 2 percentage points higher than in the baseline., while grace and maturity periods are the same as in the baseline.
3/ Exports values are assumed to remain permanently at the lower level, but the current account as a share of GDP is assumed to return to its baseline level
after the shock (implicitly assuming an offsetting adjustment in import levels).
4/ Includes official and private transfers and FDI.
5/ Depreciation is defined as percentage decline in dollar/local currency rate, such that it never exceeds 100 percent.
6/ Applies to all stress scenarios except for A1 (less favorable financing) in which the terms on all new financing are as specified in footnote 2.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2012 Article IV Consultation with Sudan
On September 21, 2012, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF)
concluded the Article IV consultation with Sudan.1
Background
The secession of South Sudan on July 9, 2011 has translated for Sudan into the loss of a
sizeable portion of its economic potential and a daunting challenge of adjusting to a permanent
fiscal and external shock.
Sudan’s economic conditions deteriorated in 2011, with nonoil real GDP growth decelerating to
3.4 percent and inflation picking up at about 18.5 percent. Delays in responding to the fiscal
shock resulted in an overall fiscal deficit of 1.3 percent of GDP, despite a low execution rate of
the investment budget. The deficit was mostly financed by the banking system, which resulted
in reserve money growing at 28 percent. Credit to the economy was subdued, growing only
about 8 percent.
External developments led to a contraction of the balance of payments in 2011. Exports
declined by an estimated 13 percent reflecting the drop in the second half of 2011 of oil exports,
which was only partially offset by the increase in gold exports. Imports also declined by an
estimated 7.5 percent. This restructuring of the balance of payments resulted in a current
account deficit of ½ percent of GDP. In order to stabilize the domestic currency and stop the
1

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On
return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the
Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the
Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the
country's authorities. An explanation of any qualifiers used in summings up can be found here:

draw-down on the country’s foreign exchange reserves, the authorities introduced various
administrative restrictions. These measures were, however, unsuccessful in preventing the
depreciation of the exchange rate in the curb market.
Economic conditions continued to deteriorate in the first half of 2012. The fiscal position
weakened in the first half as revenue under-performed by some 30 percent, reflecting the lack
of agreement with South Sudan on oil transit fees, compared with an execution rate of
95 percent for spending. Both reserve money and broad money grew by 24 percent, much
higher than in the first half of 2011. By end-July, 12-month inflation exceeded 40 percent.
Pressures on the Sudanese pound intensified, pushing the premium on the US dollar over
100 percent by end-June 2012.
After several months of hesitation, the authorities adopted in June 2012 a reform package that
included a step devaluation of the official exchange rate (66 percent), an increase in taxes, a
bold reduction in energy subsidies, cuts in non-priority spending and an expansion of the social
safety nets. These measures are a positive step towards restoring macroeconomic stability and
addressing Sudan’s macroeconomic imbalances. However, reaching fiscal sustainability and
enhancing growth potential will require a determined continuation of the reform momentum.
Stepping up structural reforms will also help address the underlying structural challenges facing
the economy. Key reforms include: (i) a comprehensive civil service reform, (ii) banking sector
restructuring, (iii) ambitious privatization program, and (iv) improving governance.
Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors noted Sudan’s daunting policy challenges, particularly the need to restore
macroeconomic stability and growth prospects after the secession of South Sudan. They
commended the authorities’ commitment to prudent policies, and welcomed the adoption of a
comprehensive reform program to tackle these challenges. Directors agreed that a determined
implementation of the policy agenda, supported by adequate resource mobilization at home and
abroad, will be essential to improve the economic outlook for the medium term and beyond.
Directors considered that fiscal adjustment grounded on a sound medium-term framework is
central to macroeconomic stabilization, and welcomed the recently-announced measures to
enhance revenue collection and rationalize expenditure. They recommended a phase-out of
remaining fuel subsidies in parallel with a strengthening of the social safety net, greater public
sector wage restraint, and better public expenditure management. Efforts should also focus on
widening the tax base, improving tax administration, and streamlining the taxation of extractive
industries. In addition, reforms of state finances remain necessary to put the overall fiscal
position on a sounder footing.

3
Against a backdrop of high inflation and exchange rate pressures, Directors saw merit in further
monetary tightening. They encouraged the central bank to refrain from deficit monetization and
step up reforms to enhance the effectiveness of monetary policy. In this regard, Directors called
for a switch to a reserve money anchor, improved coordination between the monetary and fiscal
authorities, and greater independence for the Bank of Sudan. Development of the interbank
market and auctions of central bank securities could also help promote intermediation and
absorb excess bank liquidity. Directors invited the authorities to discontinue central bank goldtrading operations, unify the official foreign exchange rates, and pursue greater exchange rate
flexibility.
Welcoming the adoption of the Interim Poverty Reduction and Growth Strategy, Directors
stressed the importance of reforms to improve the business climate and boost private-sector-led
growth. In this regard, priorities include further economic liberalization and diversification,
restructuring or privatization of public enterprises, and civil service and governance reforms.
They also agreed that a comprehensive assessment of the banking system should be
undertaken with a view to enhancing its development, efficiency, and resilience.
Directors called on the authorities to further strengthen their cooperation with the Fund on
policies and payments, and supported continued Fund engagement with Sudan. They
encouraged the authorities to continue making payments to the Fund, to make them on a
regular basis, and to increase them as their payment capacity improves. Noting that Sudan’s
outstanding arrears constrain its access to external financing, Directors encouraged the
authorities to step up their dialogue with creditors and donors to garner support for debt relief. A
few Directors called for exceptional efforts by the international community, including the Fund,
to support Sudan in this endeavor.

Statement by Moeketsi Majoro, Executive Director for Sudan
September 21, 2012
The secession of South Sudan on July 9, 2011 has taken a toll on the macroeconomic
stability of Sudan owing to significant loss of oil revenues and foreign currency reserves,
which in turn have precipitated unprecedented economic challenges, amidst an
unsustainable debt situation, which the international community is yet to come forward to
help resolve. My authorities face protracted balance of payments problems with a
widening current account deficit, growing pressure on the exchange rate and inflation, a
high fiscal deficit, and a growing debt burden. The loss of a significant part of oil sector
activity calls for urgent search for alternative sources of growth and employment, against
the backdrop of persistent border security tensions, constrained access to international
financial resources, and high levels of poverty and unemployment, especially among the
youth. My authorities are committed to undertaking necessary policy adjustments and
structural reforms to restore and sustain macroeconomic stability, as well as enhance
growth. In this regard, they seek technical and financial support from development
partners to facilitate an adequate and timely response to this evolving and permanent
shock to the economy.
Economic growth and diversification
Sudan's economic activity is expected to remain weak in the near term. However, my
authorities have put together the Five-Year Strategic Plan 2012-2017 aimed at enhancing
growth and development in the context of loss of significant fiscal resources. The target
is to achieve 6 percent growth by 2016 supported by increased private sector
participation. In addition, to enhance youth employment, the plan targets to build
capacity through training programs and expanded microfinance. Moreover, the plan
articulates a Three-Year Emergency Program that spells out the policy adjustment and
reforms required to restore macroeconomic stability.
Plans are underway to diversify the sources of growth away from oil production. A key
focus is to enhance agricultural production to meet domestic consumption needs
especially of wheat and cooking oil, and to expand exports of cotton and animal products.
As a result, there has been an increase in the size of cultivated land both in irrigated and
rain-fed areas. Also efforts are underway to enhance agricultural productivity through
strategic partnerships with China, Brazil and Australia. Furthermore, my authorities have
extended and annexed the Green Revolution Plan 2008-11, a plan dedicated to diversify
economic activity into agriculture, as part of the Five-Year Strategic Plan.
My authorities are increasing investments in the oil sector to enhance production through
increased prospecting and expanded refining activity. Their target is to increase oil
production from the current 115,000 to 180,000 barrels per day by end 2012 from new

2
discoveries and use of more efficient technology. There are also plans to expand three
refineries in Khartoum, Elobayed, and Port Sudan to serve the domestic market. Further,
efforts are being made to enhance exploration and mining of gold, with three companies,
Hassai Gold Mine, Dalgo Gold Mines, and Ariab Mining Company, currently involved in
production and plans are advanced to set up a gold refinery and establish a commodity
market for gold in the near future.
Fiscal policy and reforms
My authorities have revised the FY2012 budget and decided on revenue and expenditure
measures to reduce the budget deficit. In preparing the budget, my authorities had
initially taken into account expected flows of oil transit fees meant to finance one third of
the budget but with delays in finalizing the negotiations on oil revenue sharing with
South Sudan, it became difficult to fill the significant budget hole. The measures spelt
out in the revised budget include, on the expenditure side, a cut in the number of
constitutional posts, a reduction in privileges and entitlements of constitutional post
holders, prioritizing government spending, tightening government procurement while
encouraging purchases from the local market, rationalizing allocation of fuel to
government departments, and continuing with liquidation and privatization of
government companies. Revenue measures include an increase in development tax on
imports from 10 to 13 percent except for capital commodities, production inputs, and
some essential commodities, an increase in VAT from 15 to 17 percent and an increase in
business profit tax from 15 to 30 percent.
To cushion the impact of these measures on the vulnerable population, the budget
proposes to lift fuel subsidies gradually, reduce customs duty levied on dry milk and
edible oil, retain tax and duty exemptions on imported wheat, flour, sugar,
pharmaceutical drugs and food additives, and increase the number of poor households
benefiting from the direct government support from 500,000 to 750,000.
My authorities recognize that gold and agricultural sectors are potential sources of raising
tax revenue. However, at the moment, they fear that imposing taxes may result in
smuggling of gold, and consequently loss of foreign reserves, as the sector is presently
dominated by small artisans. In addition, imposing agricultural tax is not considered
appropriate as it would mean taxing the poor who derive their livelihood from
agriculture.
Last month my authorities reached an agreement with South Sudan on the outstanding
issues around oil transit fees and transitional financial assistance. The transit fee has
been set at US$11 per barrel for the crude oil from Unity state and US$9.10 for Upper
Nile state oil for a period of three and half years. In addition, a payment of US$3 billion
was agreed upon as part of the transitional financial assistance expected to cover one

3
third of the authorities’ budget for the oil revenue lost in the first six months of FY2012.
However, implementation of the deal is dependent on Sudan and South Sudan agreeing
on the remaining issues under the CPA 2005, especially border security.
Monetary policy
Inflationary pressure has recently increased but my authorities are committed to take
policy measures to rein in inflationary expectations. Inflation increased from 30 percent
in May 2012 to 37 percent in June and 42 percent in July. My authorities attribute this
sharp increase to imported inflation mainly because of the heavily depreciated parallel
exchange rate that is used widely in payments of international transactions. They also
view the purchase of gold by the Central Bank of Sudan (CBOS) at the parallel rate, and
selling at the official rate as a key channel of injecting liquidity and increasing
inflationary pressure. CBOS is taking various measures to reduce money supply
including by raising banks’ cash reserves and undertaking open market operations.
My authorities are committed to a flexible exchange rate regime but prefer a gradual and
comprehensive approach to avoid escalating inflation. The first quarter of 2012 saw the
parallel exchange rate depreciate significantly as a result of deterioration in the balance of
payments, increased speculative activities, and foreign currency substitution needs.
Various measures have been taken to stabilize the exchange rate including by rationing
imports and increasing exports of gold and agricultural products. My authorities have
also received foreign deposits from friendly partners aimed to build official foreign
reserves. Further, to align the official exchange rate with the parallel rate, both the
indicative rate and the commercial banks trading rate have depreciated significantly.
Debt relief
My authorities have made significant progress on the technical aspects of the debt relief
process. In addition to successful debt reconciliation, the IPRSP has now been passed by
parliament and is ready for sharing with the IMF and World Bank. Further, my
authorities have continued to demonstrate their commitment to normalizing their
relationship with the Fund by continually making payments to clear their arrears with the
Fund, albeit with a reduction in the amounts paid mainly because of the challenging
economic situation. Despite the progress made so far and the continuing commitment to
engage with the Fund through the Staff Monitored Program, there are growing concerns
on the feasibility of reaching the decision point of debt relief before the expiry of the
“Zero Debt Option” in July 2013, and the implications that this would have on the goal
for “Two Viable States”. My authorities are keen to see political issues surrounding the
debt relief resolved as soon as possible.

4
Relationship between Sudan and South Sudan
With regard to the Comprehensive Partnership Agreement (CPA) 2005, there are
outstanding issues between Sudan and South Sudan that are yet to be agreed upon. They
include security arrangements, border demarcations, the final status of the contested
Abyei area, cross-border trade, and the status of nationals residing in both countries. My
authorities are committed to a successful and timely conclusion of these issues to ensure
peaceful coexistence and improved trade relations which are critical for viability of the
two states.
Conclusion
My authorities are facing critical challenges in restoring macroeconomic stability and
revamping economic growth. While they have shown commitment to policy adjustment
and implementation of the reform agenda, maintaining the momentum is threatened by
limited access to external resources. Furthermore, the failure to move quickly to decision
point in the debt relief process is constraining needed development financing. My
authorities are thankful for the continued policy advice and technical support from the
Fund, and are seeking your support in overcoming the considerable challenges facing the
country.
