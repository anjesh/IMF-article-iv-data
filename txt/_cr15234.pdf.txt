IMF Executive Board Concludes 2015 Article IV Consultation with the People’s
Republic of China
On July 22, 2015, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded the
Article IV consultation1 with the People’s Republic of China.
China is transitioning to a new normal, with slower yet safer and more sustainable growth. Growth
last year fell to 7.4 percent and, this year, is forecast to slow further to 6.8 percent on the back of
slower investment, especially in real estate. The labor market has remained resilient despite slower
growth, as the economy pivots toward the more labor-intensive service sector. This, in turn, has
supported household consumption. Inflation is forecast to remain at 1.5 percent, pulled down by the
appreciation of the real effective exchange rate and falling global commodity prices.
Fiscal policy has been accommodative and continues to be impacted by off-budget activity. As of
end-2014, augmented debt (general government plus off-budget activity) rose to around 57 percent of
GDP. Monetary policy has remained broadly neutral, as interest rate cuts have matched the decline in
inflation. Credit growth has decelerated significantly and shifted more toward conventional banking
loans, as a result of stricter regulation on shadow banking. Growth in total social financing—a broad
measure of funding—decelerated from the peak of 22 percent in May 2013 to 12½ percent in May
2015.
Considerable progress has been made in external rebalancing. The current account surplus fell to
2.1 percent in 2014 from the peak of around 10 percent in 2007, and the renminbi has appreciated by
about 10 percent since last year in real effective terms. Further progress has also been made on
domestic rebalancing, with consumption contributing 0.1 percentage points more to GDP growth than
investment in 2014, and labor income gaining a larger share in GDP.
Executive Board Assessment2
Executive Directors commended the authorities’ success in implementing critical economic policies
and reforms, evidenced by China’s remarkable development over the last 35 years. They observed
that the reliance on credit-financed investment since the global financial crisis has created large
vulnerabilities. In this regard, they welcomed the authorities’ commitment to move to a more

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with members,
usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial information, and discusses
with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a
report, which forms the basis for discussion by the Executive Board.

At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the Board, summarizes the views
of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the country's authorities. An explanation of any

2
sustainable growth model. They considered that a key challenge is to ensure sufficient progress in
reducing vulnerabilities while preventing growth from slowing too much and advancing structural
reforms.
Directors considered that reining in vulnerabilities is a priority. They welcomed the progress made in
this regard, including by slowing down credit growth, especially in shadow banking; moderating
investment, led by a slowdown in residential real estate; and passing a new budget law aimed at
safeguarding fiscal sustainability. However, they agreed that more needs to be done to put
vulnerabilities on a downward path, including a further decline in real estate investment, multi-year
deleveraging, and medium-term fiscal consolidation.
Directors highlighted the challenge of managing the slowdown, and recommended that
macroeconomic policies should be calibrated to achieve an orderly adjustment by aiming for GDP
growth of 6½ to 7 percent this year and 6 to 6½ percent next year. They agreed that monetary policy
should take a wait-and-see approach, especially as significant easing would risk exacerbating the
credit and investment vulnerabilities. Meanwhile, a sharp contraction in local government spending
that would reduce the augmented fiscal deficit should be avoided this year, in view of headwinds to
growth from slowing credit and real estate investment. Directors considered it appropriate to start a
gradual consolidation next year that lowers the augmented deficit to 8 percent of GDP by 2020 and
puts public finances on a sustainable path.
Directors underscored that further structural reforms are needed to make the Chinese economy more
open and market-based and promote further internal rebalancing. These include moving to a more
market-based financial system and monetary policy framework, including completing interest rate
liberalization and eliminating implicit guarantees; reforming state-owned enterprises; moving to an
effectively floating exchange rate; and strengthening the fiscal framework, including local-central
government relations, the social security system, and tax policy. They noted that these reforms are in
the authorities’ agenda and welcomed the steps that have been taken. Looking ahead, they urged
steadfast and timely implementation of the envisaged reforms.
Directors took note of the staff assessment that the external position in 2014 was moderately stronger
than is consistent with fundamentals. They agreed that this highlights the need for continued reforms
to further reduce excess savings and achieve a sustainable external balance. They also noted the staff
assessment that the substantial appreciation of the renminbi in real effective terms this year has
brought the exchange rate to a level that is no longer undervalued. A few Directors pointed out that
further exchange rate adjustment could further facilitate external adjustment. Directors welcomed the
steps taken to liberalize the capital account and recommended carefully sequencing these efforts.
Directors noted the authorities’ wide-ranging policy response to the recent equity market correction.
They agreed that exiting these interventions in a timely manner would be consistent with the move
toward a more market-oriented financial system. The focus should be on maintaining the liquidity of
systemically important institutions and groups of institutions and strengthening the framework for
market regulation, supervision, and crisis management.
Directors encouraged the authorities to continue to improve data quality, especially fiscal data, and
welcomed their commitment to subscribe to the Special Data Dissemination Standard.

STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2015 ARTICLE IV CONSULTATION

KEY ISSUES
Context. China is moving to a ‘new normal,’ characterized by slower yet safer and more
sustainable growth. The transition is challenging, but the authorities are committed to it. They
have made progress in reining in vulnerabilities built-up since the global financial crisis and
embarked on a comprehensive reform program. With China now the globe’s largest economy,
success is critical for both China and the world.
Focus. The discussions focused on policies to manage this transition. In particular, how to meet
the challenge of simultaneously: (i) unwinding accumulated imbalances while preventing growth
from slowing too sharply; and (ii) advancing structural reforms toward a new growth model. The
baseline assumes that the authorities succeed and move the economy to a more balanced and
sustainable growth path, with higher consumption and an external position in equilibrium by
2020.
Outlook and macro policies. Growth is projected at 6.8 percent this year, down from
7.4 percent last year. This slowdown, which is in line with the authorities’ target of around
7 percent and staff’s recommended range of 6½ to 7 percent, reflects progress in addressing
vulnerabilities, including slower total social financing (TSF) growth, tighter oversight of shadow
banking, a correction in real estate, and a new budget law. To ensure further progress in
addressing vulnerabilities, GDP growth should be permitted to slow to 6–6½ percent next year.
External assessment. Substantial real effective appreciation has brought the renminbi to a level
that is no longer undervalued, but the external position is still moderately stronger than
fundamentals—highlighting the need for reforms to reduce excess savings and achieve sustained
external balance.
Structural reform. Progress has been made, but considerable work remains in implementing
the authorities’ reform agenda in the financial, fiscal, state-owned enterprises (SOE), and
external sectors. Priorities are moving to a more market-based financial system; improving
the management of government finances; leveling the playing field between SOE and the
private sector; and having an effectively floating exchange rate regime within 2–3 years. The
faster the progress, the sooner the growth-enhancing benefits will materialize.
Risks. Insufficient progress in containing vulnerabilities and advancing structural reforms
continues to pose the biggest risk to the outlook. If realized, it could result over the medium term
in a disorderly correction and/or a protracted period of slower growth. Near-term domestic and
external risks are considered low, given existing buffers and policy tools.

PEOPLE’S REPUBLIC OF CHINA

CONTEXT
1.
China’s success, China’s challenge. China is now the world’s largest economy (PPP basis),
which is testament to its record of successful reforms and development policies. But the country is
far from rich: per capita income (PPP basis) was 24 percent of the U.S. level in 2014, and 14 percent
in U.S. dollar terms. Thus, China still has considerable room to grow and catch-up to advanced
economy status. However, as evidenced by international experience and the literature on the middle
income trap, convergence is by no means guaranteed. China’s future success, like its past
accomplishments, will depend on continued implementation of necessary yet often difficult macro
policies and reforms.
2.
New leadership, new direction for the economy. The current leaders have now been in
power for two years. Historically, this is a time when policy implementation has often accelerated. It
is also the time to formulate the thirteenth five-year plan (2016–20). The leadership has emphasized
an economic agenda focused on enduring improvements in people’s livelihood. This includes
promoting inclusive growth, improving the environment, and fighting corruption. The Third Plenum
reform blueprint, announced in late-2013, set out a comprehensive agenda to be completed by
2020. On the economic side, the aim is to move to a more sustainable growth model, including by
giving the market a decisive role in the economy. It also covers issues such as urbanization, rural
land reform, one-child policy, environment, and institutional frameworks.
3.
Adjustment underway. The authorities’ plans are in line with previous staff advice and
progress has been made. Credit growth, in particular the ‘shadow bank’ component, has slowed; the
real estate sector is undergoing a needed adjustment; and a new budget law is tackling the
challenges of local government finances. Reforms aimed at liberalizing the financial system have
also advanced (Appendix I). Key achievements include the introduction of deposit insurance and
progress in liberalizing interest rates.
4.
Significant challenges still ahead. Faster progress on growth-enhancing reforms is critical.
Since the global financial crisis, the pattern of growth has relied on an unsustainable mix of credit
and investment. This has led to rising government and corporate debt, increasing pressure on the
financial system, and declining investment efficiency. Moving to a safer and more sustainable
growth path requires reversing these trends. Doing so will reduce demand, and thus unavoidably
slow near-term growth. Managing this slowdown is a key challenge: Going too slow will lead to a
continued rise in vulnerabilities, while going too fast risks a disorderly adjustment. The key to
managing this trade off is structural reforms to boost potential growth.

RECENT ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS AND OUTLOOK
5.
Moving to slower yet safer growth. Growth in China is moderating, a slowdown that is
largely a by-product of moving the economy away from the unsustainable growth path since the
global financial crisis. Staff projects China to grow at 6.8 percent this year, consistent with the
authorities’ target of around 7 percent and within the 6½–7 percent range staff considers
appropriate for this year.

While demand indicators also point to moderation, led
by a correction in real estate construction, household consumption and retail sales have held up well,
largely on the back of a robust labor market that reflects the ongoing transition to more labor-intensive
growth. In terms of regions, the slowdown is concentrated: six provinces (Tianjin, Liaoning, Jilin, Hebei,
Shanxi, and Yunnan) that together account for only 15 percent of GDP explain over 80 percent of the
decline in real growth from the 2012–13 average of 7.8 percent to 7.4 percent last year.

of credit, which contracted 19 percent in 2015 (January-May, year-on-year). The reversal was a result of
stricter regulation of shadow banking activities, which also helped improve the composition of TSF
growth toward conventional bank loans. TSF growth has also been affected by tighter financial
conditions as reflected in REER appreciation and, earlier this year, rising real interest rates (from falling
inflation). The central bank has, since last November, lowered the benchmark lending rate by 90 basis
points in three steps and twice cut reserve requirements.1 While these steps initially coincided with a rise
in interbank interest rates, the seven-day interbank repo and one-year interest rate swap have both
declined since March.

10 percent of GDP. This estimate is subject to
considerable uncertainty due to data gaps (Table 5). The official fiscal stance in 2015 continues to be
‘proactive.’ The 2015 budget implies a positive fiscal impulse of about 0.4 percentage points of GDP, with
the on-budget deficit expected to widen to around 2½ percent of GDP. The new budget law and
declining land sales may constrain local government (LG) spending this year (see below), but so far
infrastructure investment has remained buoyant.
10.
Authorities’ view. The authorities recognized the economy is transitioning from a high to a
medium-to-high growth rate, which is one of the characteristics as China enters a new normal. They
remained confident of achieving their target of around 7 percent growth for this year. Growth
moderated, but was still within a reasonable range. While downward pressures remained significant, they
expected activity to firm in the coming months as the effect of recent policy measures filtered through
the economy. On inflation, they agreed that supply shocks, not slower growth, were the main factor
driving down headline CPI. They considered that inflation was likely to stay positive. A recent PBC

1.4 percent, and a current account surplus of 2.9 percent of GDP.

U.S. dollar. Despite this appreciation, Q1 registered a
strong trade surplus, driven largely by lower commodity prices and the domestic slowdown. However,
capital outflows have also been strong, and monthly proxies for intervention suggest that the PBC has
not intervened to buy foreign currency since July 2014. Indeed, the PBC appears to have been selling
reserves since late last year, with proxies suggesting cumulative sales of 137 billion U.S. dollars from
October 2014 to May 2015.

13.
External assessment. The external position in 2014 was moderately stronger compared with the
level consistent with medium-term fundamentals and desirable policy settings, and the renminbi was
moderately undervalued (Appendix II). Since then, as noted, there has been substantial appreciation in
real effective terms. Nonetheless, staff projections for 2015 suggest that the external position probably
remains moderately stronger than fundamentals. There are several factors influencing a country’s external
position, with the exchange rate being one of them. While undervaluation of the renminbi was a major
factor causing the large imbalances in the past, staff’s current assessment is that the real effective
appreciation over the past year has brought the exchange rate to a level that is no longer undervalued.
However, staff’s assessment that the external position is probably still too strong highlights the need for
other policy reforms—which are indeed part of the authorities’ agenda—to reduce excess savings and
achieve sustained external balance (paragraph 23). Reserves were at 149 percent of the IMF’s composite

metric at end-2014 (down from 160 percent in 2013); relative to the metric adjusted for capital controls,
reserves were at 238 percent, down from 254 percent in 2013. Given China’s progress and plans with
capital account liberalization, the appropriate metric is shifting toward the unadjusted one; under either
metric, further accumulation is unnecessary from a reserve adequacy perspective.
14.
Authorities’ views. The authorities concurred with the staff assessment of the progress in
domestic rebalancing, citing the stable labor market and job creation, rising household incomes, relatively
strong retail sales, and continued expansion of the service sector. They reiterated their commitment to
transforming the economy toward the new growth model, and considered the speed of ongoing
rebalancing as appropriate. Investment, they noted, would still play a critical role, but the challenge was to
make it more efficient while also relying more on consumption as a driver of growth. On external
rebalancing, the authorities welcomed the assessment that the renminbi was no longer undervalued.
However, they thought the current account surplus last year was in a reasonable range and that the
external position was close to equilibrium.

THE CHALLENGE: MANAGING THE SLOWDOWN,
ADJUSTMENT, AND REFORM
15.
Discussions focused on the challenges of addressing vulnerabilities, managing growth, and
implementing reforms. Vulnerabilities have reached the point that addressing them is an urgent priority.
Adjustment cannot be too sharp, as this would be destabilizing, but at the same time it cannot be
delayed, as that would only make the problem bigger. Reducing vulnerabilities will inevitably lead to
slower growth in the near term. Over the medium term, potential growth will be determined by the
progress with structural reforms. The staff baseline assumes that the authorities succeed in reining in
vulnerabilities and implementing their reform agenda. Growth is therefore projected to moderate further
in the coming years as vulnerabilities are reduced, then stabilize over the medium term as the benefits of
structural reform take hold.

A. Vulnerabilities
16.
Despite progress in addressing vulnerabilities, much work remains. Progress is evident in
slower real estate investment and credit growth, especially shadow banking. However, so far this
slowdown has largely just reduced the rate at which

Rising fiscal debt. Continued fiscal policy
support since the global financial crisis, manifested in the
high augmented deficit, has brought the augmented

deferential, the dynamic is changing as growth slows. Although there is still fiscal space to support activity
in the transition to the new growth model, the augmented deficit has to come down over the medium
term.
18.
Rising credit and risks to financial stability. A variety of indicators suggests that credit has
risen to an excessive level. These include the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) credit gap
measure and the high credit-to-GDP ratio in China relative to other economies at a similar income
level (Box 3). The credit-to-GDP ratio is still growing, albeit at a slower rate given the recent
slowdown in credit flow. Official banking

eroded. Deleveraging and a further slowdown in the economy could reveal more problems with
credit quality, especially in the SOE sector—SOEs account for the bulk of corporate liabilities and
their performance indicators have weakened since 2008 (Figure 7). The equity market rally is another
source of financial sector risk, especially given the increasing role of margin financing (Box 4).3
Global debt issuance by Chinese firms and their offshore subsidiaries has also increased
considerably, but remains small relative to the stock of TSF and thus does not pose significant risks
for financial stability (Figure 8).

Buildup of housing inventory. Years of
very high real estate investment have resulted in
considerable oversupply. Residential real estate
investment—which accounts for more than
two-thirds of total real estate investment—has been
an important source of growth and employment,
including by boosting activity in related industries.
However, housing inventories have risen a lot,
especially in smaller (Tier 3 and 4) cities, which on
average have unsold supply of around three years
of sales. These smaller cities are macro relevant as

they account for over half of real estate investment. While a correction in real estate has started and
growth in real estate investment has slowed, working off the excess inventories will require a
multiyear adjustment (paragraph 37 and Box 5).
20.
Authorities’ views. The authorities agreed on the importance of shifting the pattern of growth
and reducing vulnerabilities. On the augmented fiscal deficit and debt, they continued to consider the
staff’s estimates as too high, especially as some of the LG debt was commercial. However, they did not
provide alternative estimates, and noted that the local government submissions of outstanding debt
earlier in the year were still being reviewed and verified. On credit, they acknowledged the rapid rise, but
noted that part of the increase represented financial market deepening and a welcome shift toward more
market-based financial intermediation.

keeping growth at about 7 percent for the next two
years would require another substantial increase in investment (Box 6). Given falling corporate
profitability, such investment would require a commensurate increase in credit flow, boosting further the
credit-to-GDP ratio and credit gap. Investment efficiency would continue to drop and eventually financial
conditions for the private sector would tighten, leading to a sharp reduction in investment, much slower
growth, and increasing risk of disorderly adjustment.

exercises, and growth convergence regressions—suggests that growth of around 6½ percent in 2020 is

ambitious yet achievable with successful reforms (Box 6 and Figure 6).
23.
Toward internal and external balance by 2020. The staff baseline assumes that the Third
Plenum blueprint is implemented by 2020 as announced by the authorities.4 Implementing these
reforms—including social security, financial sector, fiscal, exchange rate, capital account, and SOE
reforms—will reduce excess savings, lower investment, raise productivity, and boost consumption. The
investment-to-GDP ratio declines as growth becomes less capital intensive and shifts to more laborintensive services. At the same time, reforms increase income and lower savings by households (with
better social security and financial systems) as well as corporates (financial, SOE, and resource pricing
reforms). As a result, national savings fall by more than investment, and the external position moves
gradually to a level consistent with fundamentals and desirable policies (a current account surplus of less
than 1 percent of GDP). This also assumes that the REER adjusts with changes in fundamentals and, for
example, appreciates in line with faster productivity growth in China (relative to its trading partners).
Although the shift from investment to consumption (domestic rebalancing) continues beyond 2020, the
current account surplus remains unchanged as savings falls in line with investment.
24.
Authorities’ views. While the authorities clearly recognized that the current growth model
needs to change, they considered that growth may stay close to the current level without
jeopardizing long-term sustainability. They viewed China’s existing buffers as sufficiently large, and
had a more benign view on the efficiency of investment and therefore the outlook for potential
growth. They also considered that the excess inventories in housing were less than staff estimated,
thus the correction in the market could be shorter and smaller.

POLICIES
A. Reducing Vulnerabilities while Managing Demand
25.
Demand management—finding the right balance. For this year, staff continues to see
GDP growth of 6½‒7 percent as striking the right balance between addressing vulnerabilities and
minimizing the risk of too sharp a slowdown/disorderly adjustment. Compared to 2014, this would
allow for a further moderation in the growth rates of investment, especially residential real estate,
and TSF. If incoming data suggest that growth is likely to exceed 7 percent, then measures should
be taken to reduce vulnerabilities faster. If instead growth looks set to dip below 6½ percent, then
fiscal policy should be eased. Fiscal stimulus, if needed, should be on-budget and rely on measures
that protect the vulnerable, support rebalancing, and are consistent with the reform agenda. All
goals that can be best achieved through fiscal policy. For 2016, to allow further progress in
addressing vulnerabilities, GDP growth should be permitted to slow to 6–6½ percent.
26.
Current macro policy stance is adequate. While it is difficult to assess the monetary and
fiscal policy stance in China using conventional definitions, staff considers that the current policy
setting is broadly consistent with the macro outcomes in the staff baseline (Box 7). However, the

growth and the ongoing correction in real estate.

Fiscal Policy: Reform While Avoiding a ‘Fiscal Cliff’
27.
Off-budget fiscal activity remains substantial and bringing it on-budget has proven
challenging. Adoption of the new budget law in late 2014 was as an important milestone in fiscal
management. It will create a much-needed framework for local government borrowing, improve
transparency, and strengthen medium-term fiscal planning. A key goal of the new framework is to
bring all spending that is fiscal in nature into the budget and finance it transparently, while clarifying
that other, commercial investment projects of local governments do not have an explicit or implicit
government guarantee. The transition to this new framework is complex and will take some time,
especially for ongoing projects started under the previous regime where the perimeter between
government and commercial activity was not clear and financing arrangements often were not
consistent with the projects’ future cash flow.
28.
Avoiding the fiscal cliff. Staff advice is to keep the augmented deficit in 2015 broadly
unchanged at 10 percent of GDP. Strict implementation of the new budget law could generate
a sharp contraction in LG spending (‘fiscal cliff’) that would reduce the augmented deficit to well
below 10 percent of GDP. This would have a large adverse impact on near-term growth, which
should be avoided. Accordingly, the authorities have taken a series of measures to ensure that local
governments can meet their ongoing financing needs, facilitating both the refinancing of maturing
obligations and the funding of ongoing and new projects (by issuing LG bonds, extending bank
loans falling due, and public-private partnerships—PPPs—for which new guidelines were issued in
May). The staff recommends that a clear and comprehensive transition plan for LG financing under
the new budget law be announced as soon as possible. The solution will need to find a balance
between (i) preventing an abrupt contraction in fiscal spending; (ii) not undermining the budget law
through excessive forbearance; (iii) minimizing moral hazard from rewarding imprudent borrowing
by local governments; and (iv) limiting damage to the financial system from uncertainty and shifting
the costs to banks.

12

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

PEOPLE’S REPUBLIC OF CHINA

29.
Medium-term fiscal adjustment. Gradual fiscal adjustment should start next year, with a
modest reduction in the augmented fiscal balance of around ½ percent of GDP each year. Over the
coming years, the pace of adjustment could accelerate as the headwinds from reining in
vulnerabilities dissipate and the benefits of structural reform take hold. The staff baseline assumes a
gradual consolidation in the augmented deficit to around 8 percent of GDP by 2020. While
augmented debt would continue to rise, it would peak at around 70 percent of GDP in
2020 (Appendix III). The structure of fiscal spending is also assumed to adjust in line with structural
reforms to promote rebalancing, with lower investment creating room for higher on-budget current
expenditures reflecting additional spending on health, strengthening of the social safety net, and
bringing some of the legacy social security obligations on budget as discussed below.5
30.
Authorities’ views. The authorities were confident that the fiscal risk was being resolved
gradually without undermining the goal of the new budget law to discipline the spending and
financing behavior of local governments. They had developed a transitional plan that ensured that
ongoing projects, with contracts signed up to last year, continued to receive financing. They did not
regard this as overburdening banks, as many local government projects were commercially viable and
did not pose significant credit risk. They highlighted that a key goal of the new budget law was to move
all government activity to the budget, thereby clearly distinguishing that all other borrowing must be on
commercial terms (such as PPPs) and without a government guarantee. Thus, they continued to question
the usefulness of the augmented debt and deficit data. They also reiterated that fiscal policy this year
would remain ‘proactive,’ supporting growth as necessary.

Monetary Policy: ‘Wait and See’
31.
The current stance of monetary policy is consistent with achieving appropriate
inflation and growth outcomes. The ongoing slowdown is part of a needed adjustment to more
sustainable growth and not a cyclical weakening that warrants a monetary response; and the
outlook for inflation is benign, with recent disinflation related mainly to transitory supply shocks.
Following the recent steps by the central bank (RRR and benchmark interest rate cuts) and the
relaxation of LG borrowing constraints, the staff expects that TSF growth and private credit will be in
line with the 2015 projections (12 percent for TSF and 11 percent for private credit—TSF excluding
LGFVs). There is room, however, for further RRR reductions (offset by OMOs as needed) as part of
the PBC’s liquidity management.
32.
Financial stability. Going forward, the credit-to-GDP ratio needs to be brought to more
comfortable levels. The baseline scenario assumes that this occurs through a gradual reduction in
investment and credit flows, with private credit growth dropping to around 8 percent by
2020 (Box 3). Such a path is consistent with the gradual reduction investment while avoiding a credit
crunch that would result in too sharp a correction. As financial sector reforms advance, including
continued development of capital markets to increase the share of equity and bond financing, the
efficiency of financial intermediation will improve. As private sector firms gain better access to
financing, productivity gains will allow a given growth rate to be achieved with less investment and
5

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

PEOPLE’S REPUBLIC OF CHINA

credit. Staff also discussed the benefits of a more proactive policy of encouraging write-offs and
corporate restructuring, which would help more quickly to release both credit and physical resources
to more efficient uses (see Box 3).
33.
Authorities’ views. The authorities explained that the monetary policy stance remained
neutral, and that the recent benchmark rate and require reserve ratio (RRR) cuts were done to offset
the reduction of liquidity arising from the decline of foreign exchange deposits, and the tightening
in monetary conditions from falling inflation. Going forward, the policy stance would remain the same.
Although they saw space for additional cuts in benchmark rates and RRRs if needed to keep the stance
neutral, they remained mindful of the need to contain leverage. Policies would continue to work on
strengthening the monetary transmission mechanism, and facilitate the broader reform agenda for a
more market-based financial system. Regarding deleveraging, the authorities were working to simplify
the process of write-offs for nonperforming loans, including through changes in relevant tax policy
and legal procedures.

pace. In particular, this means a continued decline
in housing construction, but healthy growth in housing demand, to allow time for demand to catch
up to supply. To achieve this, policy options—to be calibrated depending on local real estate market
conditions—include adjusting mortgage terms, varying restrictions put in place during years of rapid
growth, and provision of affordable housing. In March 2015, the authorities introduced a package of
measures, including reducing land supply in cities with excess housing inventory; increasing the
loan-to-value ratio for second mortgages from 40 percent to 60 percent; and shortening the
minimum period for housing sales tax exemption from five to two years of residency. Social housing
investment and shanty town renovation projects have also been increased. These policies have
helped cushion the adjustment as evidenced by the recent stabilization of prices and floor space
sold; going forward policies must be careful to avoid rekindling investment in the real estate market,
particularly where housing inventory is elevated.
1/

35.
Authorities’ views on real estate. While acknowledging some structural imbalances at the
regional level, the authorities regarded the ongoing correction in real estate as largely a cyclical
phenomenon, while underlying housing demand remained strong. They were confident that the set
of measures introduced to stabilize the market had a desired impact, and that further measures
14

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

PEOPLE’S REPUBLIC OF CHINA

could be deployed in case of a deeper slowdown. They also considered that the imbalances were
smaller than estimated by staff, and that measures to boost demand could play a stronger role in
restoring balance in the market.

B. Reforms for Growth
36.
Structural reforms to unleash new sources of growth. While a period of slower growth is
necessary to reduce vulnerabilities, slower growth is not a goal unto itself. Instead, the goal is to
move the economy to a safer and higher-quality growth path. The Third Plenum reforms will achieve
this, but faster implementation is needed—the faster the progress, the sooner the benefits will
materialize.

floating (benchmarked to SHIBOR). A deposit
insurance system was introduced in May. It insures deposits up to RMB 0.5 million (about
US$80,000), which covers slightly under half of deposits but over 99 percent of accounts. The
authorities have granted licenses to five new private banks, including some affiliated with large
internet companies.
1/

38.
Moving to a market-based financial system. This means completing interest rate
liberalization, ending the over reliance on window guidance and moral suasion, and removing
implicit guarantees. A defining characteristic of a market-based financial system is that banks set
their deposit rates, lending rates, and loan policies based on market conditions and commercial
considerations. Without this, it will not be possible to get the better allocation of resources—
through improved access to credit and lower borrowing costs for the private sector—that is critical
for transforming the growth model.
39.
Liberalization with strengthened supervision. The deposit rate ceiling is the last
remaining formal interest rate control, but it has a significant impact on the costs of funds and thus
interest rates throughout the system. The time has come to complete the liberalization of deposit
rates. Deposit insurance is in place, flexibility has been progressively increased, and the ceiling does
not appear to be binding for most of the banking system. Concerns about destabilizing competition,
especially among smaller banks, should be addressed through supervision and regulation. More

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

15

PEOPLE’S REPUBLIC OF CHINA

broadly, the progress made in strengthening supervision and regulation should continue. Looking
ahead, priorities include (i) continuing with efforts to manage risks from shadow banking (and shift
intermediation back to bank balance sheets) and (ii) guarding against new pockets of risk, such as
rising leverage in the equity market. The upcoming FSAP will offer an opportunity to discuss a wider
range of financial sector reforms.
40.
Breaking the web of implicit guarantees. Implicit guarantees are prevalent throughout
the financial system, leading to mispricing of risk and misallocation of resources. Breaking this web
will introduce greater uncertainty into the financial system and cannot be done overnight. At the
same time, the process must start and will involve greater acceptance of defaults, credit events, and
bankruptcies. This applies, in particular, to state-owned enterprises (SOEs), which benefit from
preferential access to financing supported by a perceived state backing of their liabilities. Such
perceptions create an uneven playing field that distorts the allocation of financing toward SOEs,
crowds out the private sector, and lowers productivity growth.
41.
Upgrading the monetary policy framework. A key element of a market-based financial
system is a monetary policy that uses market-based interest rates as the primary instrument.
Building on the progress already achieved, establishing a policy interest rate and using it as the main
tool to adjust monetary conditions and signal changes in policy is a priority. Preparatory steps
should include reducing the volatility in interbank interest rates through an effective interest rate
corridor, improving the functioning of standing facilities, and introducing reserve averaging.
Required reserve ratios (RRRs) remain high (18.5 percent for large banks), which imposes an implicit
tax on banks that hurts depositors and borrowers and encourages shadow banking. RRRs should be
lowered gradually and, if needed, the liquidity impact offset by increased OMOs. In addition, the
central bank’s efforts to improve communications are welcome, although there is currently no clear
interest rate signal for the authorities’ policy objectives. A further strengthening of
communications—including by explaining monetary policy in the broader context of
macroeconomic risks and developments—will be an important part of upgrading the monetary
policy framework.
42.
Authorities’ views. The transition to a market-based financial system and monetary policy
was progressing, the authorities explained. The monetary transmission mechanism, however, was
posing challenges, and, thus, the focus should be on facilitating the transmission mechanism of
benchmark lending rate and strengthening the yield curve, especially SHIBOR; introduce reserve
averaging; improve the PBC’s standing facilities; and enhance the flexibility of open-market
operations (OMOs). They noted the progress on interest rate liberalization, and for next steps, the
PBC would continue to expand the scope of pricing discretion by financial institutions, and will select
the right opportunities to complete interest rate liberalization. Regulation and supervision had been
strengthened, especially to limit risks from off-balance sheet activity. Regarding implicit guarantees,
they agreed that resolving these would improve credit allocation, but flagged the need to advance
gradually to avoid widespread defaults that may pose systemic and macroeconomic risks.

SOE and Fiscal

43.
Deepening SOE reform to level the playing field. Leveling the playing field between
private and public enterprises is critical to unleashing new sources of growth. Progress with SOE
reform, however, has been too slow. Important reforms include accelerating the increase in dividend
payments, ensuring dividends flow to the budget instead of being recycled to other SOEs,
eliminating direct or indirect subsidies of factor costs (land, energy, capital), strengthening
governance, and improving the commercial orientation. Ultimately, successful SOE reform will also
have to include greater tolerance of SOE bankruptcy and exit while exposing them fully to private
competition, especially in the tertiary sector (including financial services, logistics, health, and
education). Similar to the SOE reforms in the late 1990s and WTO-related opening of manufacturing,
these reforms have the potential significantly to boost productivity growth and create millions of
jobs.
44.
Authorities’ views. The authorities’ stressed that deepening SOE reform remained one of
the priorities, and disagreed with the assessment that it was going too slow. They noted that there
had been steady progress, including increasing dividend payouts, tighter rules on compensation,
and advances in mixed-ownership and governance. Moreover, they had implemented measures to
encourage private entrepreneurship, such as streamlining business registration, and the number of
newly registered private firms has surged since last year. They noted that SOE reform featured
prominently in the Third Plenum and that they would continue to press ahead with reforms,
including leveling the playing field. This would also need to include the costs associated with
addressing legacy problems and spinning off social functions of SOEs. Regarding exit of unviable
SOEs, they agreed that this was also important, but considered the problem to be substantially
smaller than in the late-1990s due to better social safety nets and stronger SOE finances. On
dividends, they were committed to reaching the target of 30 percent payout to the budget by 2020.
45.
Continued fiscal reforms. Fiscal reforms are advancing on many fronts, and Fund
management recently signed a multiyear technical cooperation agreement with the MOF. Continued
progress is being made in extending the VAT to services, and the authorities plan to finish this by
the end of the year. Minimizing the number of VAT rates to, ideally, a single rate would have
significant administrative benefits, and the policy objectives of multiple rates could be achieved with
other fiscal instruments. Recent increases in petrol taxes and ongoing reforms to natural resource
taxation are positive steps that will promote more environment-friendly growth. Following the
landmark new budget law, finding a long-term solution to the imbalance between local government
spending responsibilities and revenue assignments remains a priority. The national rollout of a
property tax will help in this regard by providing an important source of local government revenue.
46.
Further social security reform. Pension reforms are crucial for achieving the desired
rebalancing of the economy toward consumption. The authorities continue making strides toward a
more equitable, sustainable, and integrated social insurance system (Box 8). After rapid expansion,
pension and health insurance will soon reach universal coverage. Efforts to reduce pension
fragmentation include the unification of the pension schemes for rural and urban residents, and recently
unveiled plans to integrate the systems for civil service and enterprise workers. The scheme for enterprise
workers remains unsustainable in the long term—already today, contributions (excluding subsidies) are
only 87 percent of benefits, according to 2015 social security fund budget. Parametric reforms are
INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

17

needed to help address looming deficits related to population aging. A key step is to increase retirement
ages, which would improve pension system finances and help boost labor supply. Another priority is to
lower the current high and regressive contribution rates—mandatory contributions to pension, medical,
unemployment, occupational injury, and maternity benefits add to over 40 percent of wages. The
lost revenue will need to be offset by a combination of parametric reforms and a broader reform of
the tax system and the financing of social insurance programs.
47.
Authorities’ views. The authorities noted that tax reform remained an ongoing priority.
They explained that the VAT reform was proceeding well and that, while they understood the
rationale behind a single rate, multiple rates were helping to smooth the transition to the wider VAT.
They highlighted that ongoing work on tax reforms was focused on improving the personal income
tax system, including a lower burden on low and middle-income households; strengthening
resource taxation to help protect the environment; and introducing a nationwide property tax. The
authorities were committed to achieving universal social insurance coverage by 2020. They were
equally committed to maintaining the long-term sustainability of the pension system, while ensuring
proper incentives to participate in a multi-pillar structure. In addition, they were aiming to improve
information systems to facilitate the exchange of records across social security and health insurance
systems and provinces, which should help increase portability among social security systems and
facilitate policy coordination.

External
48.
Greater exchange rate flexibility. A more flexible, market-determined exchange rate is
needed for allowing the market to play a more decisive role in the economy, rebalancing toward
consumption, and maintaining an independent monetary policy as the capital account opens. With
capital flows sizable and growing, the “impossible trinity” (inability to have an open capital account,
independent monetary policy, and tightly managed exchange rate) will become increasingly binding.
Thus, without more exchange rate flexibility, China will have less and less room for its own monetary
policy, appropriate for its specific cyclical and structural conditions. Reform should aim to achieve an
effectively floating exchange rate—with intervention limited to avoiding disorderly market
conditions or excessive volatility—within 2–3 years. International experience suggests there are
many options for advancing reform (Box 9). Steps over the next few months could include a further
widening of the band and changes to how the central parity is set.
49.
Capital account liberalization. The past year has seen continued, gradual progress in
opening the capital account, including the establishment of the Hong Kong-Shanghai Stock Connect
scheme, increased quotas under various cross-border investment programs, introduction of mutual
recognition of eligible mutual funds between Hong Kong SAR and the Mainland, and opening the
onshore repo market to offshore renminbi clearing and participating banks (up to the limit of their
onshore renminbi bonds). This is a key component of the broader financial reform agenda, aimed at
enhancing the efficiency of corporate funding and widening the range of investment options
available to residents. To achieve this, capital account opening has to be sequenced carefully with
reforms to strengthen the financial system, safeguard macrofinancial stability, and make the
exchange rate more flexible.

SDR. The authorities expressed interest in having the renminbi included in the SDR basket
and are undertaking reforms to support the international use of renminbi. This issue will be covered
in the forthcoming review of the method of valuation of the SDR.
51.
Data. The authorities are working closely with staff to complete the technical work for China
to subscribe to SDDS. Staff encourages the authorities to participate in the Coordinate Portfolio
Investment Survey (CPIS).
52.
Authorities’ views. The authorities shared the goal of moving to a more flexible,
market-determined exchange rate, and noted the progress they had made. In particular, after years
of accumulating foreign reserves, the central bank had retired from day-to-day intervention since
the second quarter of 2014. Still, they would step into the market occasionally to reduce
unwarranted fluctuations and contain excessive speculative pressures. Regarding the capital
account, the authorities planned to continue gradually liberalizing toward “managed
convertibility”—supplemented with close monitoring, microprudential limits, and macroprudential
and capital flows measures as necessary. Upcoming reforms could include a new qualified domestic
individual investors scheme (so-called QDII2) and Hong Kong-Shenzhen Connect for equities. On
data, they were committed to continue improving them and were on-track to complete the
subscription to SDDS this year.

SPILLOVERS, DOWNSIDE RISKS, AND ALTERNATIVE
SCENARIOS
A. Spillovers
53.
Reforms are good for China and the
world. The near-term slowdown in economic activity
in China is a price worth paying for safer and more
sustainable growth. Staff simulations based on the
FSGM model suggest that the impact of such a
slowdown on other major economies is relatively
minor, while slow progress in reforms or containing
vulnerabilities—resulting in much lower income in
China over time—would have significant negative
spillovers in the medium to long term.

other metals. The demand from China has therefore been seen as supporting world commodity prices
in the aftermath of the global financial crisis, and this view has been strengthened by the association
between the slowdown in China’s investment growth and the recent decline in commodity prices.
Staff empirical estimates based on a structural VAR indicate that the impact of China on global
commodity prices has indeed been increasing and is now sizable. Simulations based on the GIMF
model suggest that the impact depends on how the slowdown is perceived: it would be largest if fully
anticipated, which could be interpreted as a substantial revision of expectations regarding growth
prospects (or, equivalently, a misperception about growth prospects before the slowdown, which
could have led to excessive investment in future supply). While this would have an adverse impact on
commodity producers, simulations suggest that it would not have a major deflationary impact on the
world economy given the cushioning effect of lower commodity prices on global demand and solid
medium-term growth prospects in China.

for its trading partners, particularly in the region. For
example, the move up the value chain has contributed to a sharp improvement in China’s trade deficit
with the main Asian electronics supplier countries even as its surplus with the United States and the
European Union has continued to rise. Meanwhile, the exit from labor intensive goods—albeit gradual
given remaining pockets of relatively cheap labor in inland China—has allowed low-income Asia (such
as Bangladesh, Cambodia, and Vietnam) to fill the space vacated by China.6



55.
Authorities views. The authorities broadly agreed with staff’s assessment, emphasizing positive
spillovers from the steady rise of the Chinese economy. They also noted potential spillovers from the ‘One
Belt One Road’ initiative, which would bring substantial benefits to both China and the region through
greater integration, improvement in infrastructure, and increased trade. While they also concurred with
staff assessment that opportunities for growth in low-value added industries are limited, given the
ongoing transition to higher-value added products with associated increases in wages, they maintained
that reservoirs of relatively cheaper labor in inland China could still allow for some growth in
labor-intensive industries, particularly given improvements in infrastructure in less developed regions.

B. Downside Risks
56.
The biggest risk is inadequate progress in advancing reforms and containing
vulnerabilities. As illustrated in the no-reform scenario discussed above, vulnerabilities would continue to
rise if the unsustainable pattern of growth persisted and reform progress was too slow. Over the medium
term, the likelihood of China falling into a period of protracted weak growth would rise considerably, and
the risk of a sharp and disorderly correction would increase as the existing buffers—a still relatively
healthy public sector balance sheet and large domestic savings—would diminish. This risk would also
increase with the opening up of the capital account—potentially leading to large outflows should market
sentiment change—pointing to the importance of careful coordination of liberalization steps with other
structural reforms. As noted, achieving a ‘soft landing’ of this economy while addressing vulnerabilities
and advancing structural reforms, as envisaged in the baseline, will be challenging. Thus, staff considers
this risk to be of medium likelihood. The illustrative no-reform scenario and related spillovers analysis
suggest that the realization of this risk would have a high impact on China and the global economy.
57.
Near-term risks are manageable. The
hard-landing risk described above is considered to be
of low probability in the near term. Fiscal and financial
buffers, combined with the still-important role of the
state, leave the authorities with sufficient tools to
respond effectively to support growth if needed.
While these buffers are diminishing over time, they
should still allow the authorities to prevent a shock—
such as widespread credit events, disorderly
correction in real estate, or policy mistake—from
triggering a negative feedback loop that spirals out of
control. Other risks include:



External risks. China’s large size, limited financial integration, capital controls, and sizable reserves
provide cushions against global shocks (see Appendix IV for the Risk Assessment Matrix).



Fiscal cliff. Tighter fiscal control over local government finances combined with falling land sales
revenue could lead to a sharp reduction in local government spending. However, as discussed above,
so far infrastructure spending has held up in 2015 (a good proxy for local government off-budget
spending) and measures have been introduced to ensure financing.



Equity market. The stock market shows signs of froth. Wealth effects from an asset price correction are
likely to be small. Thus, while a correction could take place, it is unlikely to have a significant macro
impact, although risks are rising given the fast increase in leverage (Box 4). The authorities have taken
steps to contain risks, especially from margin lending; staff recommends continued vigilance to
prevent macro risks, including potential linkages to the banking system.



Deflation. While a deeper-than-expected slowdown could contribute to deflationary pressures,
particularly in upstream industries benefitting from the past investment boom, staff assess the risk of

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

21

PEOPLE’S REPUBLIC OF CHINA

deflation as low at the current juncture. As noted above, disinflation so far appears largely explained
by supply shocks, and price declines in overcapacity sectors do not translate to wider deflationary
pressures given robust labor market and consumption. However, the risk of deflation bears close
watching.
58.
Authorities’ views. The authorities broadly agree with the staff assessment that risks are low in
the near term. In their view, they also had substantial buffers that would be sufficient to fend off any
pressures in the medium term, and therefore the trade-off between addressing vulnerabilities and
supporting economic activity was not as sharp as illustrated in staff scenarios. They were monitoring
closely the developments in equity markets and were confident that their approach was appropriate,
aiming to prevent macro risks without being overly interventionist.

C. Alternative Scenarios
59.
Faster transition. While the baseline scenario assumes the authorities succeed in
addressing vulnerabilities and implementing reforms, there is scope for even faster progress. Staff
discussed the following options:


Deleveraging. Keeping credit and labor resources in inefficient activities diminishes growth
prospects and leads to a further deterioration in balance sheets. A more proactive
restructuring—which could include increased write-offs of NPLs, bankruptcies, and exits
(including of unviable SOEs)—would more quickly break this trend. It would help unclog credit
intermediation, allowing the dynamic firms that will drive future growth to get better access to
credit, and free up labor that could flow to more productive activities. While it would initially
hurt bank balance sheets and increase unemployment, these problems could be addressed by a
comprehensive plan that would include a strong social safety net for laid-off workers, and a
financial sector restructuring program to deal with bad assets and recapitalize banks as needed.
Moving faster may ultimately prove less costly than trying to “grow out of the problem” though
a protracted period of fairly tight credit conditions.



Fiscal spending. The fiscal adjustment in the baseline assumes a gradual reduction in public
sector investment (particularly by LGs), partly offset by increased social spending. Given high
multipliers from investment spending, this path supports growth, but at the cost of prolonging
potentially inefficient spending. A more aggressive restructuring could more quickly replace it by
on-budget spending (while keeping the adjustment path broadly unchanged), which would help
accelerate the transition towards consumption-led growth.

60.
Simulation results show higher medium-term growth and less risks. While the
immediate growth impact would be negative in the faster transition scenario (given potential costs
of restructuring under faster restructuring and lower multipliers from higher social spending), these
policies would also contribute to faster deleveraging and restructuring of the economy, higher
medium-term growth (largely through efficiency gains) and a more sustainable growth pattern.

61.
Authorities’ views. The authorities considered that the current speed of transition struck the
right balance between addressing vulnerabilities and supporting growth. While optimization of
resources allocation was a key reform goal, it was promoted through several other policy initiatives
in the Third Plenum blueprint (such as market-oriented reforms of SOEs), and moving too fast would
be both potentially unnecessary and costly. Similarly, the authorities considered the process of
implementing the new budget law as orderly and fiscal policy as sufficiently ‘proactive,’ and they did not
see a need for higher budget expenditures to offset the impact of the new budget law on local
government spending.

STAFF APPRAISAL
62.
China’s development over the last 35 years has been remarkable. Since 1980, the
economy averaged growth of around 10 percent a year, real per capita income quadrupled, and
some 600 million people were lifted out of poverty. These achievements are testament to China’s
success in implementing critical, yet often difficult, economic policies and reforms. As a result, China
is now the largest economy in the world (PPP basis). At the same time, income per capita is still a
large distance from advanced-economy levels. China thus can, and needs to, continue along its
remarkable development path for decades to come. But to do so, it must also continue to
implement critical, yet often difficult, economic policies and reforms.
63.
The road ahead is challenging. Since the global financial crisis, the reliance on
credit-financed investment as the prime engine of growth has created large vulnerabilities in the
fiscal, real estate, financial, and corporate sectors. Addressing these will inevitably slow growth. Thus,
a key challenge is to ensure sufficient progress in reducing vulnerabilities while preventing growth
from slowing too much. Slower growth, of course, is not a goal unto itself but an unavoidable byproduct of reining in vulnerabilities. Over the medium term, this unpleasant tradeoff can only be
improved by structural reforms that create new sources of growth. The faster the progress, the
sooner the growth will bottom out in a sustainable way.
64.
The staff’s baseline scenario assumes China succeeds in this transition to a ‘new
normal,’ characterized by slower yet safer and higher-quality growth. This assumption is

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

23

PEOPLE’S REPUBLIC OF CHINA

justified by the authorities’ progress in addressing vulnerabilities, willingness to let growth slow, and
announced reform agenda. In the baseline, growth is forecast gradually to slow to 6 percent in
2017 before stabilizing in the 6 to 6½ percent range through 2020.
65.
Vulnerabilities have risen to the point that reining them in is a priority; while notable
progress has been made, more needs to be done. Credit growth has slowed significantly over the
past few years, and shadow banking has been reined in; investment is cooling, led by a reduction in
residential real estate growth; and a new budget law was passed to address off-budget borrowing.
However, in most areas the progress has just succeeded in slowing the pace at which vulnerabilities
rise. For example, TSF growth slowed, but is still increasing faster than GDP; and residential real
estate investment is still increasing and, thus, adding to the excess supply of housing. Further
progress, therefore, is needed to put vulnerabilities on a downward path, including a decline in the
level of residential real estate investment, multiyear deleveraging to help close the credit gap, and
medium-term fiscal consolidation.
66.
The challenge for macro policy is to manage the slowdown. Growth will slow as
vulnerabilities are reined in. However, adjusting too fast could prove destabilizing. Macro policies,
therefore, should be calibrated to achieve an orderly adjustment by aiming for growth of 6½ to
7 percent this year and 6 to 6½ percent next year. With growth this year on track in this range and
the inflation outlook benign, monetary policy should take a wait-and-see approach, especially as
significant easing would risk exacerbating the credit and investment vulnerabilities. Further cuts in
RRR, however, are warranted not as an easing measure but as part of effective liquidity
management. The augmented fiscal deficit should remain broadly unchanged this year, given the
headwinds to growth from slowing credit and real estate investment. Next year, it would be
appropriate to start a gradual consolidation that lowers the augmented deficit to 8 percent of GDP
by 2020 and puts public finances on a sustainable path.
67.
Despite progress, the unfinished reform agenda is long and complex. In the decade
before the global financial crisis, a series of bold reforms made the economy more open and
market-based. The result was rapid growth, fueled by productivity gains as workers moved from
farm to factory. The challenge now is to take the next steps in the transformation to a more open
and market-based economy, which will again require bold reforms. These include moving to a more
market-based financial system and monetary policy framework; SOE reforms, including increased
dividend payments, leveling the playing field (especially in services), and exit of unviable SOEs;
having an effectively floating exchange rate within 2–3 years; and strengthening the fiscal
framework, including local-central relations, the social security system, and tax policy. All of these
elements are in the authorities’ reform agenda. With steadfast and timely implementation, China
can avoid falling into a low-growth pattern and continue its remarkable convergence to
advanced-economy income levels.
68.
China’s success is critical for China and the world. Continuing along the old growth path
is not an option. The biggest risk is that progress in reining vulnerabilities and advancing structural
reforms is too slow and that China, therefore, stays on the old growth path for too long. This would
eventually result in a major slowdown in China that would have significant negative spillovers to the
24

PEOPLE’S REPUBLIC OF CHINA

global economy. Thus, staff commends the authorities for undertaking the transformation to a ‘new
normal.’ While this means somewhat slower growth in the near term, it is a tradeoff worth making
for much higher income in China over the medium term. An outcome that brings higher living
standards to China and stronger growth worldwide.
69.
It is proposed that the next Article IV consultation with China take place on the standard
12-month cycle.

Box 1. Risk of Deflation1
Inflation in China has declined, largely reflecting lower global energy prices and currency appreciation. With
inflation expectations appearing well anchored and still-healthy wage growth, the risk of deflation in the
near-term appears moderate.
CPI inflation has decelerated. As of end-May, headline inflation had fallen to 1.2 percent (year-on-year),
after averaging 2 percent in 2014. The decline is largely related to food and energy prices (Figure 1). Core
inflation, meanwhile, has been stable and remained between 1–2 percent for some time.
Slower growth is also weighing down inflation, but the impact is relatively small. Previous research
has found a fairly weak relationship between the output gap and inflation. For example, Maliszewski and
Zhang (forthcoming) estimate a Philips Curve using a system of equations based on a production
function, and find that 1 percentage point widening of the output gap pulls down inflation by only
0.1 percentage points.2 Simple regressions find a larger impact of changes in the business cycle (based on
HP filter) on inflation, operating mainly through food prices. These results suggest that a 1 percent
widening of the business cycle would increase

Market inflation projections are low and stable: the

latest consensus forecast is for 2 percent average
inflation in 2016, similar to staff’s forecast of 1.8 percent. Staff’s forecast assumes that inflation picks up
gradually in the second half of 2015 as the base effect of the oil price shock wanes.

The pass-through from falling producer prices (PPI) to CPI will be limited. Since 2012, CPI inflation
has been consistently higher than PPI inflation. The declining PPI could reflect a variety of factors,
including excess capacity in some sectors, global developments (PPIs have followed a similar pattern in
several Asian economies), and, more recently, falling commodity prices. While the lack of pass through in
recent years is not fully understood, it could be related to a Balassa-Samuelson effect (faster productivity
growth in tradable sectors drives up wages in all sectors, resulting in rising nontradable prices).
Consistent with this, nontradable good prices are rising faster than tradable, as evidenced by prices in
tertiary (service) sector growing faster than secondary (manufacturing) sector prices.

Box 2. Labor Market Developments1
The labor market has so far been resilient to slowing growth, but reforms are key to the performance going
forward.
Based on official data, labor market conditions appear to have held up well so far, despite the
growth slowdown. Newly-created urban jobs reached 13.2 million in 2014, exceeding the official target of
10 million new jobs; and Q1:2015 saw an additional 3.2 million of new urban jobs created. Available data for
wages also suggest that, on average, demand for urban labor has remained quite robust, growing by
around 8 percent in line with GDP growth. Since the global financial crisis, demand for urban labor has
consistently outstripped supply, wages have grown faster than nominal GDP, and the official registered
unemployment rate remained stable at around 4 percent (and the unemployment rate based on surveys
around 5 percent). Migrant workers’ wages have stayed at about 60 percent of urban workers over the past
few years, after growing significantly faster than urban wages during late 1990s and early 2000s.
Several factors may explain the apparent resilience of labor market conditions. The impact of slowing
GDP growth is likely mitigated by favorable longer-term trends that support labor market conditions,
including continuing urbanization and the expansion of (more labor-intensive) services sectors. Also,
anecdotal evidence suggests that state-owned enterprises (SOEs) may be keeping workers formally
employed despite overcapacity and weakening profitability, and that the use of migrant labor is declining.
And finally, data shortcomings make an accurate, up-to-date assessment of labor market conditions
difficult—while key data series on labor markets are available, their coverage, frequency, and timeliness
have important limitations. For example, the registered unemployment rate is based on self-registration for
unemployment insurance, which misses the migrant workers that return home when losing their job.
Going forward, implementation of the reform agenda will play a key role in labor market conditions.
The planned reform or the household registration system (‘hukou’) and less labor hoarding in SOEs will likely
increase the supply of labor, which in turn should be absorbed by new employment opportunities that will
arise from opening up the services sector and other, productivity-enhancing reforms. At the same time,
fiscal reforms on taxation, health care, pensions, and education will help narrow the urban-rural income gap
(Lam and Wingender, 2015), which will limit rural-urban (migrant) labor flows and unemployment pressures.
(Empirical analysis based on provincial data and international comparison suggests that migrant labor flows
are driven strongly by growth and the urban-rural income gap, while the services sector share of output and
employment is closely related to per-capita GDP.)
Staff analysis suggests that, with reforms, urban employment growth could stay around 10 million
per year. A quantitative scenario analysis illustrates the impact of structural trends, demographics, and
reform implementation on labor market conditions (taking into account demographic trends). It finds that,
with medium-term growth of around 6–6½ percent, net urban employment could stay near 10 million per
year—meeting the current policy target.2 Stepped-up reform of SOEs and adjustment in overcapacity
sectors would, in the near term, release excess labor and push up unemployment rate by ½‒¾ percentage
points. However, this would facilitate the structural transformation—including services sector expansion and
new investment in productive enterprise—to a more sustainable growth path. In contrast, delays in reform
implementation would further build up vulnerabilities and weaken medium-term employment prospects.

Box 3. Deleveraging1
Credit in China has risen rapidly and is high by many metrics. The corporate sector, in particular, has increased
debt-to-GDP ratios since the global financial crisis and a period of deleveraging is warranted.
Credit is high. Total social financing (TSF) and the BIS measure of credit to the private sector are complementary
ways to measure credit to the nonfinancial private (that is, nongovernment) sector. Both increased dramatically

capacity sectors. Household debt has doubled since
2008, but is still low. It is primarily for mortgages (with relatively low loan-to-value ratios), represents just a
fraction of household wealth, and is actually less than household deposits.
The high level of credit could weigh on China’s growth and financial stability. Cross-country evidence
suggests that episodes of similar credit booms often ended abruptly, accompanied by financial crises or
prolonged slowdowns in GDP growth3 (see figures). This risk is still low in China, but it is growing. The steep rise
in corporate investment after the global financial crisis has been financed by credit. But the efficiency of
investment has been falling, with a commensurate fall in corporate sector profitability. This makes debt
servicing costs more difficult and therefore debt more risky. In particular, the interest-coverage ratio has
been falling in SOEs and in over-capacity sectors (which together account for the bulk of the increase in credit).
While the high level of domestic saving has made it easier to finance this growth model, it is not sustainable as
falling investment efficiency will eventually drag down GDP, household income, and thus savings. A decline in
asset prices would also pose risks. While the average debt-to-asset ratio is relatively benign compared to other
countries, the ongoing housing market correction may erode the asset side of corporate balance sheets
(especially land and property), particularly in the real estate sector.
Going forward, investment remains an important driver of growth, thus large credit flows are
still needed to finance new projects. Under staff baseline projections for gross fixed capital formation,
this implies TSF growth staying relatively high, although falling gradually from around 12 percent in
2015 to 8 percent in 2020. This assumes only a moderate increase in corporate profitability, as
productivity-enhancing reforms are largely offset by the rationalization of factor costs (including higher
wages). Greater reliance on capital markets to raise financing would reduce the need for credit for the
corporate sector, but this is offset by growing lending and borrowing within sectors, particularly the
process of financial deepening facilitating access to financing for households.

Box 3. Deleveraging (continued)

Faster debt write-offs would help improve credit flow and investment efficiency, and reduce risks. While
there is no evidence that the credit channel is impaired in China, financing for the private sector appears to have
been crowded out by lending to SOEs. This is especially a

investment; see Box 6), the credit-to-GDP ratio would continue to rise on an unsustainable path. This shows that
‘growing out of the debt’ is not an option under the old growth model.
The size of potential write-offs would be manageable. Staff estimates that closing the BIS ‘credit gap’ by
2020—would require write-offs averaging around 1 percent of current debt (around 1.5 percent of GDP) per year,
relying on a combination of transferring bad assets to asset management companies and public sector support.
The scenario assumes that capital buffers and provisioning remains unchanged, which would allow banks to lend to
new and more productive projects. The gross fiscal costs in this scenario would be under 10 percent of GDP
excluding the cost of putting in place an enhanced social safety net. This, however, assumes no recoveries and
overstates the net cost to the public sector to the extent that the write-offs facilitate exit of unviable and lossmaking SOEs (removing implicit subsidies, and potentially leading to an increase in dividend payments to the
budget from remaining SOEs as overcapacity is reduced). Any fiscal support to banks or companies should be done
in an incentive-compatible way that minimizes moral hazard going forward. For the banks, an immediate step
should be a rigorous quality assessment of loan portfolios, setting the stage for addressing NPLs and the potential
need for bank recapitalizations. Recapitalization should be conditional on reforms to prevent a repeat accumulation
of bad loans.

Box 4. China’s Equity Market: Recent Developments and Risks (continued)
for households and institutional investors to achieve a more desirable risk-return profile for their savings and
assets. Through end-May, there had not been a substantial increase in capital raised through domestic
(A share) public offerings.
The rally is associated with rising risks, such as a sharp rise in margin financing. An influx of new,
potentially less informed, investors and rising leverage increase the risk of a disorderly market correction.
New investors are flooding into the market and retail investors account for about 80 percent of traded
volume. The amount of money investors have borrowed from securities firms to buy equities has risen more
than five-fold since end-Q2:2014, to RMB 2.2 trillion or 8 percent of the free-float market capitalization
(3.2 percent of GDP). The regulator’s increased scrutiny of securities firms’ lending has done little to slow the
rise in borrowing. Until recently, wealthy investors were accessing leverage multiples far higher than
brokerage accounts through structured products known as “umbrella trusts,” with the funding provided by
other investors, including wealth management products. Such borrowing is estimated by some analysts to
have reached RMB 1 trillion, and regulators have recently taken steps to tighten the regulation on umbrella
trust.
Wealth effects from changes in equity prices are rising, but previous studies suggest they are likely to
be small. This holds even after accounting for the recent increase in the market’s size and number of
investors.1 Based on free-float capitalization, a 25 percent change in prices would change the value of
household, corporate, and institutional investor equity holdings by about RMB 7 trillion, equivalent to
10 percent of GDP and 9 percent of household financial assets at the end of 2013. As a comparison, an
equivalent price change in the United States would lead to a change in free-float value of over 30 percent of
GDP. Moreover, survey data suggest that financial assets account for just 5 percent of total household assets;
financial assets are primarily bank savings and cash (text chart); and only 9 percent of households own
equities and 4 percent mutual funds. Financial services have also been contributing more to growth,
especially since the equity rally started. A correction, especially if it has implications on the financial sector,
could directly reduce growth with knock-on effects to the rest of the economy.

Box 5. How Big Is the Risk of a Real Estate Slowdown and Does It Matter?
China’s housing market has softened visibly since 2014, reflecting oversupply in most cities. More adjustment is
likely.
All indicators point to weakness in China’s housing market. Housing prices have been
moderating both at the national level and across all city tiers, with the weakest performance among
the smaller cities. Floor space sold, a good indicator of housing, has declined on a year-on-year basis since
mid-2013 (sales volume picked up slightly at end-2014, following the relaxation of home purchase
restrictions and easing of mortgage financing). On the supply side, floor space starts contracted by
14.4 percent in 2014, compared with 11.6 percent growth in 2013. This is mirrored by slowing real estate
fixed asset investment, from about 20 percent growth in 2013 to 9.2 percent in 2014.
Housing inventory ratio—floor space unsold to floor space sold—shows a buildup since 2013,
suggesting oversupply. Even though there is uncertainty regarding the level (National Bureau of Statistics
(NBS) data show inventory of four months, while data from local housing bureaus suggest higher than two
years), the direction of the buildup is clear. Inventory is especially high in Tier 3 and Tier 4 cities.1., 2
Continued adjustment in floor space starts is warranted to let demand catch up with supply. To
better understand how the oversupply came about and how the real estate market may return to
equilibrium, staff analyzed China’s housing demand and supply dynamics. The oversupply is measured by
the cumulative gap between floor space starts and floor space sold (1–2 years ahead to account for the
average construction time). Floor space sold is projected taking into account fundamental determinants
of demand, which indicates that a continuation of the historical demand trend is likely. The baseline
scenario assumes that the oversupply is eliminated by 2020, broadly in a linear fashion, through a moderate
contraction in floor space starts. A stronger pickup in demand could help marginally to narrow the excess
supply gap, but it is unlikely to fully offset a potential contraction in floor space starts.
The adjustment will have significant impact on GDP growth. Given the estimated relationship
between growth in floor space starts and in real estate gross fixed capital formation (GFCF), real estate
GFCF could slow to -2 to -4 percent in 2015 from about 3 percent in 2014.3 As real estate GFCF
accounts for about 9 percent of GDP, this would imply a drop of GDP growth by about ½ percentage
point in the baseline scenario. This abstracts from the indirect effect arising from real estate linkages to
upstream and downstream sectors. Some of these sectors suffer from oversupply, and a slowdown in
construction activity could bring losses, exposing vulnerabilities and posing risks (IMF, 2014).
–––––––––––––––––––––
1
The differences may be attributable to different methodologies in data collection. The NBS data rely on developers’ selfreporting registration that is subject to underreporting in unsold units and over-reporting in sales, while data from local
housing bureaus record all real estate registration, including buildings that have obtained permits to sell.
Chinese cities are generally grouped into four categories: Tier 1 cities include Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, and
Shenzhen; Tier 2 cities include 35 cities, mostly provincial capitals; other small and medium-sized cities are grouped into
Tier 3 or Tier 4 cities.
2

Staff uses the real estate GFCF series estimated using the NBS data to keep the investment concept compatible with the
national account (GDP) data. Staff estimates the real estate GFCF series by taking a share of real estate investment in total
fixed asset investment (both series from the NBS) and apply it to the measure of GFCF in the national account.

Box 6. Growth Scenarios
Although growth is initially higher under a no-reform scenario, the benefits are ephemeral. Over the medium term,
the staff baseline results in both higher and more sustainable growth.
How fast can China’s economy grow? Implementation of the authorities’ reform agenda is critical for boosting
potential growth. Without reforms, vulnerabilities would continue to rise. On the supply side, there would be strong
headwinds from falling productivity and negative labor force dynamics. On the demand side, the dynamics of credit
and investment would be unsustainable due to a combination of rising interest costs in the highly indebted
corporate sector and local governments, and falling returns on investment. This would increase the risk of a sharp
or protracted growth slowdown over the medium term, even though policy buffers limit risks in the near term. On
the other hand, the implementation of the authorities’ reform program would lead to an initially slower, but
ultimately more robust and higher growth.
Without reforms, growth would gradually fall to around 5 percent in 2020, with steeply increasing debt
ratios. A no-reform scenario is constructed that assumes the authorities attempt to stabilize growth at around
7 percent. This strategy would eventually fail, as growth would slow as the marginal product of capital falls and
productivity growth stagnates. The slowdown would be due largely to the falling contribution from capital
accumulation and productivity growth:



Productivity growth stays low. Investment efficiency has been adversely affected by the rapid scale-up, and the
contribution of total factor productivity (TFP) to GDP growth has fallen to about 1½ percent per year. The
no-reform scenario assumes the decline is permanent, with TFP growth gradually stabilizing at around
1 percent per year by 2030.



Labor force dynamics start subtracting from growth. The contribution of employment to growth has remained
positive, but has been falling fast (from ½ percent per year in early 2000s to ¼ percent now). Population aging
combined with a falling participation rate will further reduce labor force growth, which is projected to drop to
zero by 2020 and then turn negative, stabilizing at about -¼ percent per year.



Capital contribution starts falling. The investment ratio would stay high initially, as the authorities attempt to
stabilize growth at around 7 percent by relying on old growth engines (credit and investment). But this
investment would contribute proportionally less to the capital stock than in the past, and the investment ratio
would subsequently fall given the unsustainable credit-investment dynamics. The decline would be gradual,
though, and the ratio would stay well above 40 percent of GDP by 2020.



Credit intensity of growth continues to be high given the reliance on investment, which translates to increasing
debt ratios both for the private and public sector.

The policies assumed in the staff baseline would translate to higher and more efficient growth. Specifically,
reining vulnerabilities and implementation of Third Plenum reforms would improve resource allocation and
facilitate the transition to more sustainable growth. These objectives translate to lower, but more efficient
investment. Staff estimates based on a broad range of previous studies (Barnes and others, 2011)1 suggest that
gains in TFP growth would be in the 1–1½ percent range per year (Lam and Maliszewski, forthcoming).2 Although
activity would temporarily weaken with slower investment, the reforms would ultimately lead to higher growth with
less investment and credit, which the overall debt ratio (private and public sector) of about 15 percent of GDP lower
than in the no-reform scenario.

Box 7. Monetary and Fiscal Policy Stance: Assessing and Projecting
Assessing the monetary and fiscal policy stance in China is difficult. Monetary policy lacks a policy interest rate to
signal changes in the stance, and the bulk of fiscal borrowing occurs off budget and is recorded as private credit,
which blurs the line between monetary and fiscal policy. To deal with these issues, staff constructs complementary
monetary and fiscal indicators to help assess developments and make projections.
What is the current fiscal and monetary policy stance? It is difficult to categorize the policy stance in China
using conventional definitions. The official budget excludes a substantial amount of off-budget fiscal activity.
Thus, staff considers the augmented deficit a better indicator of the fiscal stance, but it is hard to estimate and
there is no budget for such activity. On the monetary side, there is no policy interest rate to signal changes in
the monetary stance. Policy is conducted using a variety of tools including benchmark interest rates, liquidity
management (OMOs and RRRs), and window guidance. Several indicators provide a sense of the stance—
including benchmark interest rates, interbank interest rates, M2, and TSF—but may send conflicting signals and
reflect developments as much as policies. For example, slow credit growth could reflect tight monetary policy,
weak credit demand, or both. Moreover, the line between monetary and fiscal developments is also blurred by
the fact that LGFV borrowing—a fiscal activity—shows up in TSF, the most commonly used measure of private
credit.
Augmented fiscal deficit indicates the fiscal stance. LGFV borrowing accelerated in the aftermath of the
global financial crisis as a way for local governments to support demand while circumventing the rules against
local government borrowing (see figures). While some LGFV activity is commercial, staff considers that the bulk
of it is fiscal in nature. This is supported by the 2013 NAO report, which found that the government was
ultimately responsible for two-thirds of the stock of debt from LGFVs (and other local entities). Moreover, it is
not feasible to separately identify the commercial portion of LGFV borrowing based on available data. Thus,
staff constructs augmented fiscal data by expanding the perimeter of government to include all LGFVs.1
However, data on LGFV borrowing from banks—which is the main source of LGFV financing—are generally not
available. Staff estimates of the augmented deficit are thus subject to considerable uncertainty.
LGFV borrowing has been sizable, thus adjusting the monetary and fiscal data for LGFV borrowing is
important. Since LGFVs are included in the augmented fiscal data, their borrowing should be removed from
TSF. This avoids double-counting and makes the TSF data a better indicator of lending to the private sector,
defined to include SOEs but exclude government and the financial sector. Private credit is thus defined as TSF
less equity financing (which is in TSF) and less LGFVs. For end-2014, this adjustment reduces TSF and raises
government debt by 37 percent of GDP. Moreover, this adjustment is becoming increasingly important with
the rollout of the new budget law. The law could result in a reclassification of local government liabilities from
TSF to government debt as both local borrowing shifts to more on-budget financing and part of the existing
stock of local liabilities is swapped into government bonds. While TSF and government debt are impacted by
these changes, staff estimates of the augmented deficit and private credit are not. The staff-constructed
measures, thus, provide a more consistent series for assessing and distinguishing between monetary and fiscal
developments.
Staff’s macro projections are based on explicit assumptions for the augmented fiscal deficit and private
credit. For 2015, staff forecasts the augmented deficit to be 10 percent of GDP, including 6 percent of GDP
(RMB 4.1 trillion) in LGFV financing recorded in TSF. Private credit is forecast to grow by around 11 percent,
which is consistent with financing the private investment assumed in the staff baseline. TSF growth will depend
on whether local infrastructure spending is financed through government bonds or LGFVs; staff assumes that,
––––––––––––––––––

See Appendix III and Box 3 in People’s Republic of China—Staff Report, IMF Country Report No. 14/235 (2014).
2
This assumes that the 2 trillion local government bonds from the debt swap program will still be included in TSF. If instead
these bonds are recorded as government debt, then this year’s TSF growth would fall to 10.4 percent.

Box 7. Monetary and Fiscal Policy Stance: Assessing and Projecting (continued)
in line with past practice, it is financed through LGFVs.2 Regardless of how it is financed, the staff projections
are predicated on an augmented deficit of 10 percent of GDP and private credit growth of around 11 percent.
Projections for later years are done the same way, with explicit forecasts of the augmented deficit and
private credit, and private credit linked to forecasts of private investment (see Box 3).
Staff’s baseline assumes that monetary policy is adjusted as necessary to achieve the forecasted
growth in private credit. For this year, private credit growth of 11 percent translates into a 7.6 percent
decline in the flow of private credit. This likely requires a pick-up in the flow of private credit in the
remainder of the year. The flow of TSF was minus 18 percent (May, year-to-date), and while some of this is
likely due to sluggish LGFV borrowing in the early part of the year—the extent is hard to estimate with
available data—private credit growth was also likely weak. However, the benchmark interest rate cuts and,
more recently, declines in interbank interest rates are still working through the economy and will provide
some support to credit in the remainder of the year. The staff baseline assumes that further steps are taken,
if needed, to adjust the pace of private credit growth to reach staff’s year-end forecast.
Likewise, the staff baseline assumes that

deficit (text table). Through mid-June, around
RMB 500 billion of such bonds had been issued or placed with banks. After Jiangsu province initially had to
postpone its issuance—reportedly due to the high yields demanded by buyers—steps were taken to make
the bonds more attractive to banks. These included putting a ceiling on the interest rate (1.3 times of
sovereign yields) and allowing the bonds to be used as collateral for repos with the central bank. These
steps were widely seen as providing an implicit central government guarantee to the bonds, which have
since been issued at yields quite close to the sovereign. In addition, LGFVs have continued to issue bonds
on the interbank market.
Additional measures may be needed to meet local government financing needs. In May 2015, the
state council issued a directive (GuoFa Document 40) that asked banks to continue to finance ongoing
projects based on existing contracts signed before this year. For those LGFVs that cannot meet their debt
service obligations, banks and local governments can negotiate to refinance LGFV debt by extending the
maturity of the debt and/or requiring additional collateral. The remaining financing need is expected to be
met through policy banks, PPPs and, if needed, additional measures. This could include a drawdown of
fiscal deposits, asset sales, or authorization for additional borrowing.

insurance for old age and health care for workers in the formal enterprise sector (Urban Workers and Staff,
UWS), and nonsalaried workers (Urban and Rural Residents, URR). After a rapid expansion of schemes for URR
over the past five years, coverage is nearly universal (health care insurance coverage is about 95 percent and
pensions cover nearly 100 percent of those more than 60 years old). However, large disparities remain in terms
of the adequacy of benefits across schemes. For example, average URR pensions are under 5 percent of those
for enterprise retirees. Reducing this gap remains an important challenge.
The pension system needs reforms to ensure its long-term sustainability, and reduce inequities. The
pension scheme for UWS has a sizable long-term imbalance reflecting the prospects of population aging—the
present discounted value of expenditure minus contributions over 2015 to 2050 is 67 percent of 2014 GDP.
Parametric reforms could help address these looming deficits. One priority includes increasing retirement ages,

policies should aim to reduce
gaps in contributions to the individual-account component of this scheme, and raise contribution levels (today,
most participants contribute only the minimum allowable). This would allow for a larger role of contributory
pensions in the future. In addition, the modest noncontributory basic pension for the current elderly (about
2½ percent of the average private urban wage) could be raised and moved to the budget, given that these
benefits constitute an element of the social safety net.
Pensions and health care insurance remain fragmented. This is true both geographically (the central
government provides guidelines and financing, but social insurance is administered at the provincial level), and
across schemes (UWS and URR are not integrated). It impedes the development of an integrated national labor
market, and contributes to rural-urban income disparities. Further integration could improve the pooling of
demographic and economic risks, simplify administration, and increase the portability of benefits.
The relatively high level of social security contributions is a concern. For the UWS—mandatory
contributions to pension, medical, unemployment, occupational injury, and maternity benefits add to over
40 percent of wages. Reviewing the financing sources so as to reducing this burden would be crucial in the
medium term as part of a broader tax reform.

Box 9. Moving To a More Flexible Exchange Rate Regime
Since 2005, the exchange rate regime has been made gradually more flexible. However, accelerated progress is
becoming increasingly important for managing the economy and transforming the growth model. While there
are many options for moving forward, conditions are ripe for taking the next steps.
The exchange rate regime has improved a lot over the past 10 years. Since the reform in July 2005, the
intraday band has been gradually widened and the regime has facilitated considerable adjustment (the
renminbi appreciated about 30 percent against the U.S. dollar since 2005). Currently, flexibility is limited by a
daily 2 percent trading band around a central parity. Officially, the parity is determined by the weighted
average of preopening market quotes, without any limit on day-to-day movements. Thus, in theory the parity
could move significantly from day-to-day, while in reality it moves very little and much less than suggested by
market conditions.
More flexibility is becoming increasingly critical to move to an effectively floating exchange rate. It is
necessary for allowing the market to play a more decisive role in the economy, rebalancing toward
consumption, and maintaining an independent monetary policy as the capital account opens. With capital
flows sizable and growing, the “impossible trinity” (inability to have an open capital account, independent
monetary policy, and tightly managed exchange rate) will become increasingly relevant. Thus, without more
exchange rate flexibility, China will have less and less room for its own monetary policy, appropriate for its
specific cyclical and structural conditions.
There are many options for transitioning to a floating exchange rate. International experience provides
some lessons, but China’s strategy will have to be tailored to China’s specific characteristics. Unlike many
historical cases, China is proceeding from a position of strength with considerable international reserves, a
current account surplus, relatively strong growth, and low inflation. Key elements of the reform strategy
include:
 Band widening. Several countries (Chile, Israel, and Poland) have advanced by gradually widening the band
around a central parity. China has already been doing this and conditions are good for taking the next step.
The exchange rate often closes at or near an edge of the band, highlighting that the band is generally a
binding constraint. Widening it, therefore, will promote more flexibility.
 Central parity. This is the most challenging element. The principle should be to allow the central parity to
move over time in line with market forces. In theory, this would be easy if the rate was at the market
equilibrium. However, in practice the market equilibrium is both unknown and changing. The challenge is
that moving too slowly to the market equilibrium will invite speculative flows, while going too fast will
undermine the parity’s role as an anchor in the system. One option is to set the parity based on a basket.
This will introduce more flexibility against the U.S. dollar and allow the parity to move automatically in line
with global currency movements. Countries have tried various strategies for adjusting the parity, ranging
from rules-based systems (Russia) to a preannounced crawl (Israel and Poland). Another option would be to
adopt a system where the central bank explicitly sets the central parity and adjusts it on a discretionary
basis. The principle is to have a system that sets ‘speed limits’ on exchange rate movements, dampening
fluctuations due to temporary shocks, but adjusts in the event of sizable and persistent pressures.
 Intervention. To allow market forces to play a stronger role, intervention should be limited to the edges of
the intra-day band or follow a rules-based system. Sustained one-way intervention should be avoided and,
if it occurs under a given band, be a cause for adjusting the central parity and/or widening the band. Russia,
for example, had a rules-based system that entailed no intervention if the rate was near the parity, and
increasing intervention (by predetermined and preannounced amounts) as the rate moved toward an edge.
Moreover, the central parity was adjusted using a formula based on the cumulative amount of intervention,

44

PEOPLE’S REPUBLIC OF CHINA

Box 9. Moving To a More Flexible Exchange Rate Regime (continued)
thus allowing the parity automatically to adjust in line with evolving market conditions. Staff simulations
illustrate the relative advantages of different systems. For example, a Russian-style system can better
accommodate persistent fundamental shocks, as the central parity would adjust—based on the
preannounced rule—to a period of one-sided intervention (the bottom left panel). Pre-committed bands,
as used in Poland and Israel, could accommodate persistent shocks if they are wide enough, but the
process of widening typically takes time, and intervention in the meantime could be sizable. A credible
band can have a self-stabilizing effect because of the expected intervention near the edges, but this effect
might be dampened if band widening is a possibility (the bottom right panel).
 Rules versus discretion. A rules-based system has advantages of making adjustments automatic and
shielding the system from political pressure to move rate one way or another. However, discretion would
allow for easier adjustment to unusual or unforeseen developments, especially as it is difficult to design a
rule that could work in all situations.
 Transparency. Countries vary in how much information is shared about the system design and operation,
including data on intervention (e.g., India, Russia, and several countries in Latin America publish
intervention data, while most other emerging countries do not). Openness has the benefit of promoting
accountability, but could also facilitate destabilizing speculative flows by making the system too
predictable.
Complementary reforms would facilitate the move to greater exchange rate flexibility. India quickly
liberalized the exchange rate by ending intervention and switching to relying on interest rates as the primary
monetary instrument—in tandem with steps to strengthen interest rate management. This highlights the
complementary role of reforms to strengthen the monetary policy framework, especially the use of interest
rates to influence liquidity conditions and help achieve both internal and external balance. Another
consideration is hedging. Onshore and offshore hedging instruments exist, though are not widely used. There
is an aspect of a “chicken and egg” problem, as firms may not want to hedge given the lack of volatility in the
exchange rate. However, the infrastructure for hedging is largely in place and could readily be upgraded as
needed to accommodate an increase in demand.
Exchange rate reform will result in more volatility of the renminbi against the U.S. dollar. The stability
against the U.S. dollar, however, is creating instability elsewhere in the economy. In particular, it can lead to
sizable, unintended changes in the effective (trade-weighted) exchange rate, even over relatively short periods
of time; contribute to significant volatility in capital flows, and fuel excessive risk taking in both real and
financial investments as firms make decisions predicated on continued stability against the U.S. dollar.
The next step is to develop a reform strategy. An effectively floating exchange rate should be in place
within 2–3 years, before the full liberalization of the capital account. Any number of combinations of the
elements described above could work, so the key is to forge a domestic consensus so that implementation can
proceed, with the understanding that there will be some learning-by-doing and fine tuning along the way.

Box 10. Spillovers from Changing Patterns in Chinese Trade
China’s share of global exports grew rapidly. It has also been evolving, with domestic value added rising and
signs that China is losing competitiveness in some labor-intensive sectors. These changes create both
challenges and opportunities for other economies.
China has experienced a rapid export growth in the past two decades, especially before 2009. China’s
export market share rose from 2 percent in 1990 to 7 percent in 2001 (when it joined the WTO) and
13 percent in 2013. This rise has largely come at the expense of advanced economies. Their market share is
characterized by depth, such as 56 percent of global computer equipment exports or 65 percent of global
plastic toy exports; as well as breadth, as China has at least a 10 percent global market share in one-third of
all categories measured by Comtrade.
China has also moved up the value chain throughout this period. China’s value added as a share of
global totals has risen from 2 percent in 2000 to 8 percent in 2011, leaving it only below the United States at
10 percent. China’s value added as a share of its own gross exports is still below levels of the mid-90s, but
this simply reflects the initial stages of China joining the global supply chain in which gross trade rises
rapidly.
The rise in the value chain resulted in less dependence on imports for a given level of exports. China is
increasingly producing sophisticated inputs at home rather than importing them. Processing exports, a
customs classification which indicates high import content, has fallen from 56 percent of total trade in
2005 to 35 percent in recent data. This is also evident in the import intensity of specific export goods. For
example, the amount of intermediate parts imported for a final computer or telephone has plummeted.
China has lost some competitiveness in low-end categories, but less so than other economies at the
same stage of development. The higher productivity which has allowed production of more sophisticated
inputs has been accompanied by some loss of competitiveness in certain low-end categories. In furniture,
footwear, apparel and plastic toys—the categories where China first made its export mark—global market
share has reached an inflection point in recent years with mild signs of decline. However, this inflection point
has only come after reaching a market share in apparel of 50 percent, as compared to 13 percent for
Hong Kong SAR and Korea. Moreover, such an inflection point is still not evident in other labor intensive
sectors like electronics assembly. This is a testament to China’s deep supply of low-wage labor and scope for
moving production inland
Changes in China’s trade patterns have posed challenges and opportunities for its trading partners,
particularly in the region. For example, the move up the value chain has contributed to a sharp
improvement in China’s trade deficit with the main Asian electronics supplier countries even as its surplus
with the United States and European Union has continued to rise. Meanwhile, the exit from labor intensive
goods such as apparel has already created opportunities for other Asian economies, including Bangladesh,
Cambodia, Indonesia, and Vietnam.

1/ Includes central and local governments' withdrawal from budget stabilization funds.
2/ Includes adjustments for local government balance carried forward and redemption of local government bonds.
3/ Estimated from local government bond market financing.
4/ Net land sale proceeds refer to the portion used to finance current and infrastructure spending, which is estimated by subtracting the acquisition cost, compensation to farmers, and land
development from the gross land sale proceeds.
5/ Derived from net changes in estimated market financing of local government financing vehicles (LGFVs).
6/ The overall net lending/borrowing includes net land sale proceeds as a decrease in nonfinancial assets recorded above the line.
7/ Include major components of market financing of local governments, including bank loans, corporate bonds, trust loans, and LG bonds issued by central government on their behalf.
Beginning 2009-10, local governments expanded market borrowing through the use of local government financing vehicles (LGFVs). The NAO 2013 report also lists out other new
funding sources of local governments, including build-to-transfers (BT), credit and wages payable, lease financing etc.
8/ The 2013 NAO audit indicated the debt to GDP ratio as of end-2012 is 39.4 percent of GDP. Staff estimates are based on the explicit debt and fractions (ranging from 14-19 percent
according to the NAO estimate) of the government guaranteed debt and liabilities that the government may incur. Staff estimates exclude the central government debt issued for China Railway Corporation.

Appendix I. Implementation of Main Recommendations
from the 2014–15 FSAP for China
The authorities have made steady progress since the 2014 Article IV Consultation in advancing implementation of the high
priority recommendations from the 2010 FSAP. A number of market-oriented reforms have been introduced focusing on interest
rate and foreign exchange market liberalization. Interest rate reform has focused on relaxing the constraints of interest rate
ceilings. Most importantly, the ceiling on the floating range of renminbi deposit interest rates has been increased to 1.5 times the
benchmark deposit rate. The efficiency of institutions and the regulatory framework has been enhanced by greater
interdepartmental collaboration and a comprehensive restructuring of the banking regulator aimed at boosting regulatory
capacity. The authorities strengthened the financial stability and liquidity framework by expanding stress test coverage and
introducing new liquidity facilities. Efforts to build a representative yield curve continued with more regular issuance of bonds
across maturities.

In early 2015, the CBRC launched a round of restructuring that moved more
departments and personnel to the regulatory side without adding
resources, with the number of regulatory departments accounting for
77 percent of the total, compared with 57.9 percent previously, thus
improving and enhancing the regulatory arm. The number of regulatory
offices increased from 85 to 109, accounting for 78 percent of the 140 total
offices. The composition and responsibilities of the departments were
adjusted, with the creation of the following entities: an on-site inspection
bureau and a prudential regulation bureau, for the purpose of improving
the capability for discovery and investigation; a trust department, a
department for city commercial banks and a department for financial
inclusion, for the purpose of enhancing the supervision of the growing city
commercial banks and trust companies, and of improving service to small
and micro enterprises and the agricultural community.



In terms of cross-sectoral cooperation, the Inter-Ministerial Joint
Conference on Financial Supervision and Coordination, established in
August 2013, has held 8 meetings, focusing on further financial reforms,
enhanced financial risk prevention in key areas, and timely development of
regulations on cross-market and cross-sector financial innovations. It
introduced a series of policies and institutional arrangements for better
serving the real economy. It also focused on the prevention of systemic and
regional financial risks.

 The PBC is pursuing the clarification of regulatory responsibilities with

regard to financial holding companies. It is developing, in conjunction
with the financial regulatory authorities, a set of regulatory rules
covering: 1) enhanced regulation on capital adequacy, in order to
avoid double counting of capital, prevent capital arbitrage, and
effectively control leverage; 2) the regulation of related party
transactions, by keeping to the principles of fair pricing and market
transparency, including enhancing the supervision of risk
concentration and by avoiding cross-sectoral risk infection; and
3) improvement of corporate governance, by enforcing eligibility
requirements for shareholders and management and by preventing
controlling shareholders from abusing their power to the detriment of
the legitimate rights and interests of small shareholders and
customers.

 On December 30, 2014, the CBRC issued the Guidelines on Managing and

Regulating Commercial Banks on Consolidated Basis, which will take effect
as of July 1, 2015. The Guidelines contain the following key elements: an
emphasis on the primary responsibility of commercial banks in managing
themselves on a consolidated basis; further clarification of the scope of
such management based on the substantiality principle of risk
management; added provisions on operational synergies and total risk
management; expanded requirements regarding corporate governance;
refinement of risk isolation requirements; and additional provisions on
recovery plans.

 The CSRC is exploring a cross-licensing regime and supporting rules for

financial institutions such as securities companies, fund management
companies, futures companies and securities investment consulting
companies. The related research is being actively pursued.

Regulatory Ratings of Commercial Banks. This new ratings system
features improvements mainly in the areas of forward-looking
orientation, comprehensiveness, and accuracy by: 1) adopting the
evaluation of risk trends, requiring that banks with gradual
deterioration of quarterly indicators be subjected to a comprehensive
analysis of risk trends as well as to increased scrutiny of changes in
their nonperforming loans and assets; 2) adding a new quantitative
indicator, called the “ratio of loans overdue for more than 90 days to
nonperforming loans,” based on an overall consideration of risk
exposure, accuracy of loan classification, loan concentration, and level
of risk coverage, which is used to verify the authenticity of, and
identify any error in, the classification of bank loans, so as to enhance
the examination of the status of risk management vis-à-vis loans and
other assets on and off the balance sheet; 3) employing the arithmetic
mean of the 4 quarters of a year as a quantitative indicator for ratings
purposes, to minimize the impact from any sudden surge in business
for cosmetic purposes by banks at key points of time. In order to
balance qualitative factors and quantitative indicators, the new ratings
system, by adding and modifying some of the quantitative indicators,
puts emphasis on the professional judgment of the ratings staff in
developing regulatory ratings, so that the ratings system can more
fully reflect the relevant risks at commercial banks.
exchanges. It is also developing plans for site inspection on future
exchanges. For example, the Commission conducted a comprehensive
inspection in 2014 on the security of information systems and use of
business passwords at such exchanges. In 2015, the Commission
performed an overall examination of the soundness of the share
transfer system for small and medium enterprises, including filing and
daily self-regulation procedures, and confirmed the effectiveness of
the current system as well as the usefulness of self-regulation.

(referred to below as “C-ROSS) is moving forward steadily. All technical
standards of the system and plans for switching from the old to the
new system were put in place in 2014. On February 13, 2015, the China
Insurance Regulatory Commission (CIRC) released the 17 regulatory
rules of the C-ROSS, at which time the system entered into the
operational phase of the transition period. During this period, the old
and new systems will run in parallel to each other, but the old system
will serve as the basis for regulation. The CIRC will decide on the
timing for formal implementation and overall handover on the basis of
the operational and preparatory status during the transition.
 The C-ROSS is a risk-based solvency regulatory system. It classifies the

inherent risks, one of three types of risks faced by insurance
companies, into seven categories, which are further broken down into
subcategories. These serve as the basis to formulate regulatory standards,
quantitative monitoring indicators (solvency ratios) and qualitative methods
for rating overall risk, which are then used to accurately identify and
thoroughly analyze various types of risks insurance companies carry, in
order to achieve timely and accurate identification and measurement of

 The CBRC established a bureau of prudential regulation in early 2015 to

take charge of early warning and monitoring of systemic risks in banking.

 The PBC continues to improve its stress testing framework. First, coverage

was expanded from 17 major commercial banks (large banks and jointstock banks) to 28 commercial banks that have total assets of more than
RMB 400 billion each, making the stress test more representative. Secondly,
the credit risk stress test was expanded to include off balance sheet
exposures, so that coverage is more inclusive. Thirdly, the percentage
decline in housing prices was added as a stress indicator to the macro
scenario stress test of credit risk, resulting in an improvement of the testing
model. The CBRC started certain stress tests in 2014, covering the State
Development Bank, five state-owned commercial banks, 12 joint-stock
commercial banks, and the postal savings bank for a total of 19 banks. In
addition, the CBRC is working to enhance the foundation on which the
stress tests are based, including in the following five aspects: revising the
Guidelines on Stress Testing Commercial Banks; preparing the Technical
Manual of Stress Testing; conducting training on the Guidelines and the
Manual; and data collection and professional development.

Rural Financial Services
 Actions have been taken to improve the combined use of monetary, credit,

and other policy tools. In April and June 2014, the PBC twice lowered the
reserve ratios in a targeted manner by cutting the deposit reserve ratios at
county-level rural commercial banks and rural credit banks by 2 and 0.5
percentage points, respectively. It also reduced the renminbi deposit
reserve ratio by 0.5 percentage points for commercial banks that meet
requirements on prudent operation and where loans to rural or small and
micro-enterprises reach a certain percentage of total loans. In September
2014, special financial bonds were launched for rural entities. In December
2014, the PBC lowered interest rates on loans in support of agriculture and
on relending to small rural entities by 0.25 and 0.4 percentage points,
respectively.
 Improved rural financial channels by actively fostering the

development of new rural financial institutions. By the end of 2014,
there were a total of 1,233 rural banks, 14 loan companies, and 49
funding unions, with loans in support of agriculture and small and
micro-enterprises accounting for 93 percent of their total loans.
Private capital accounted for 73 percent of the capital at these
institutions.
 In an effort to improve rural financial infrastructure, rural noncash

payment and settlement services have been expanded through the
establishment of standard and simplified outlets, ATM machines, and
POS machines. Rural financial institutions have been created in an
additional 1,375 rural districts and financial services have been offered

coverage of farmers has also been pursued. By the end of 2014, credit
files were in place on a total of 160 million farmers, of which 90 million
obtained loans. Actions have been taken to spread financial
knowledge in rural areas and penalize noncompliant operations in
order to effectively safeguard the legitimate rights and interests of
rural financial consumers.
Financial Services for Small and Micro-Enterprises
 Efforts have been made to optimize monetary policy tools in order to

improve macro guidance of lending activities. This includes
implementing the Instructions by the State Council on Supporting the
Healthy Development of Small and Micro-Enterprises (GF [2014] 52) by
improving the incentive mechanism for relending to small rural entities
so as to further increase such relending, and by pooling financial
resources to support the development of small and micro enterprises.
By the end of 2014, the national balance of loans to small and
microenterprises amounted to RMB 20.7 trillion, accounting for 24
percent of all outstanding loans, reaching the related target for six
consecutive years. Loans have been extended to 11.4 million small and
microenterprises, with more than 75 percent of applications for such
loans having been approved. Coverage of integrated financial services
now stands at more than 70 percent. In more than half of the
provinces (autonomous regions and municipalities), coverage of small
and micro enterprise loans is higher than 20 percent.

 The reform of the Growth Enterprise Market (GEM) was promoted. The

CSRC on May 14, 2014 revised the Regulations on Initial Public Offering
and Listing on the GEM, which lowered the financial criteria for access,
eliminated the requirements on continuous growth and simplified
offer terms, thus expanding the coverage of the GEM. The Interim
Rules on Share Offering by GEM-Listed Companies were subsequently
announced, creating the GEM refinancing system, which constitutes a
mechanism that offers small, fast, and flexible financing.
 Significant efforts were made to develop the national small and

medium enterprise (SME) share transfer system. In January-April 2014,
the CSRC modified the Regulations on Non-Listed Public Companies. It
also issued Guidelines No. 1 through 4 on regulating such companies
and Guidelines No. 1 to No. 4 on their information disclosure and the

 The reform of rural credit cooperatives has been completed. Rural credit

institutions (including rural commercial banks and rural cooperative banks)
continue to grow in their ability to support agriculture. Agriculture-related
loans and loans to farmers accounted for one-third of and around
70 percent of all loans, respectively, playing a dominant role in providing
continued support to agriculture and rural development.

 The country has engaged in steady reform of the joint-stock system,

which was used to restructure rural credit cooperatives into rural
commercial banks. By the end of 2014, rural commercial banks and
rural cooperative banks numbered 809 in total, with assets, liabilities
and owners' equity accounting for 58.5 percent, 57.9 percent, and
67.1 percent, respectively, of those of all rural financial institutions.

 A standard corporate governance structure has been created at the Postal

Savings Bank, with a shareholder meeting, a board of directors, a board of
supervision, and a management team.

Appendix II. External Sector Assessment
China
Foreign asset
and liability
position and
trajectory

Background. Gross foreign assets, at 62 percent of GDP at end-2014 are dominated by foreign reserves, while gross
liabilities, at 42 percent of GDP, mainly represent FDI liabilities. Net IIP has further declined to around 20 percent of
GDP at end-2014; the ratio has been declining since the global financial crisis in light of the much reduced current
account surpluses, valuation changes, and still fast growth of GDP.
Assessment. The NIIP to GDP ratio is expected to be slightly above 20 percent of GDP over the medium term, with
a modest rise of the current account in 2015. Vulnerabilities are low with large foreign exchange reserves and
FDI-dominated liabilities.

Current
account

Background. The current account (CA) surplus has fallen from its peak of over 10 percent of GDP in 2007 to
2.1 percent of GDP in 2014 (2.5 percent of GDP cyclically adjusted). The decline reflects strong investment growth,
REER appreciation, weakness in major advanced economies, and, more recently, a trend widening of the services deficit
(mainly due to strong outbound tourism and education spending). Gross national saving has remained around
50 percent of GDP. In 2015, the Terms-of-trade (ToT) gains from lower commodity prices—estimated at about
1 percent of GDP—are expected increase the CA surplus to 3.0 percent of GDP.
Assessment. The CA in 2014 is 1-3 percent of GDP stronger than implied by fundamentals and desirable policies. This
assessment is unchanged from the last ESR, as the actual CA, cyclically adjusted CA, and identified policy gaps are
somewhat smaller than last year 1/. Uncertainty about the cyclical adjustment justifies a range of 2 percent for the gap.
The CA gap is mainly attributed to low social spending, reserve accumulation, and capital controls. Reforms, if
successfully implemented, will lower private saving, and reduce the CA gap.
Background. The REER has been on an appreciating trend since the 2005 exchange rate reform, gaining an average of
5 percent a year during 2006–14 (3 percent in 2014). By May 2015, the REER appreciated by 11 percent against the
2014 average, against the background of ToT gains and link of the exchange rate band to the appreciating U.S. dollar
(the renminbi appreciated against the euro (16 percent) and yen (13 percent); and appreciated 0.5 percent against the
U.S. dollar). China continues to manage closely its exchange rate and conducts intervention on an intermittent basis.
Assessment. The REER appreciation through 2014 has been broadly consistent with changing fundamentals (especially
faster productivity growth than in trading partners). The EBA models and staff judgment, consistent with the CA gap,
suggest that the 2014 average REER was 3-12 percent below the level consistent with medium-term fundamentals and
desirable policies 2/. The subsequent sizable REER appreciation appears to be more than would be suggested by
changes in fundamentals (productivity growth and improved ToT), which suggests the exchange rate is no longer
undervalued.

Capital and
financial
accounts:
flows and
policy
measures

Background. China continues liberalizing its capital account, but restrictions remain broad-based. For example,
external borrowing is regulated and portfolio flows are primarily channeled through programs that are subject to
quotas and approvals. Nonetheless, actual gross flows of FDI and other investments have been sizable
Assessment. Over the medium term, a well-sequenced loosening of capital controls that supports domestic financial
liberalization would be appropriate. The opening of the capital account is likely to lead to sizable gross capital outflows
reflecting domestic savers’ desire for portfolio diversification over the medium term. The adjustment path, however, is
hard to predict and could vary depending on prevailing market and economic conditions.

Overall Assessment:
The external position in 2014 was moderately
stronger compared with the level consistent with
medium-term fundamentals and desirable policy
settings, and the renminbi was moderately
undervalued. Since then, there has been substantial
appreciation which has brought the exchange rate to
a level no longer undervalued. Also, foreign exchange
intervention has dropped sharply. Nevertheless, the
trade surplus has risen and domestic policy gaps
remain, which suggests that the external position
probably remains moderately stronger than
warranted. Sustained external rebalancing will
require addressing the remaining domestic policy
gaps.
Potential policy responses:
External imbalances have been reduced
considerably since the global financial crisis.
Finishing the job—meaning achieving a lasting
balance in the external position—will require
continued progress in closing the remaining
domestic policy gaps. Success will move the
economy to a more sustainable growth path, with
higher consumption and lower overall saving, that
secures both domestic and external balance. This
can be achieved through successful implementation
of the authorities’ reform agenda. Priorities include
creating a more market-based financial system;
opening markets to more competition and SOE
reform; improving the social safety net; and
achieving a flexible, market-based exchange rate.
The latter is critical for facilitating the likely further
REER appreciation over the medium-term as well as
allowing for two-way movements in line with
evolving conditions.

FX intervention Background. Intervention declined in 2014, with BOP data suggesting an accumulation of US$119 billion,
US$314 billion less than 2013. Moreover, data suggest that there was minimal intervention in 2014: Q3 and, since then,
and reserves
sales of reserves of US$29 billion in 2014:Q4 and US$ 80 billion in 2015:Q1. .
level
Assessment. Reserves were at about 149 percent of the IMF’s composite metric unadjusted for capital controls at
end-2014 (down from 160 percent in 2013). ); relative to the metric adjusted for capital controls, reserves were at
238 percent, down from 254 percent in 2013. Given China’s progress and plans with capital account liberalization, the
appropriate metric is shifting toward the unadjusted one; under either metric, further accumulation is unnecessary
from a reserve adequacy perspective.
1/ The total CA gap from EBA is 2.5 percent of GDP for 2014, up from 1.5 percent of GDP in 2013 due to a change in
Technical
the residual. The change in the residual in large part reflects a revised EBA model to better capture demographics. The
Background
staff assessment puts more weight on the identified policy gaps, which capture the link between domestic reforms and
Notes
securing balance in the external position. The contribution of identified policy gaps is 1.8 percent of GDP (versus
2.2 percent of GDP in 2013), actual CA is 2.1 percent of GDP (versus 1.6 percent of GDP in 2013); and cyclically adjusted
CA is 2.5 percent of GDP.
2/ A range of 3–12 percent for the REER is consistent with the range of 1–3 percent of GDP for the CA using inverse
elasticities of 3-4 (that is, 3-4 percent REER appreciation is equivalent to a 1 percent of GDP decline in the current
account surplus). The EBA Index REER model for 2014 data shows a total REER gap of minus 6.5 percent and the
contribution of identified policy gaps of minus 7.5 percent, both in the range of 3–12 percent assessed by staff. The
EBA Level model estimates a total REER gap 6.8 percent (that is, REER is stronger than the level consistent with
medium-term fundamentals and desirable policy settings) identified policy gaps of minus 3.5 percent. However, that
estimate is discarded from consideration, as the Level model estimates appear implausible, particularly for earlier years,
suggesting little reliability in China’s case.

Appendix III. Debt Sustainability Analysis
The debt sustainability analysis assesses both general government debt and augmented debt, which
represent the lower and upper bound of fiscal obligations. While China’s general government debt remains
low and sustainable, augmented debt is on a slight upward trajectory in the baseline. Augmented debt is
sensitive to contingent liability shocks, but the risk of debt distress is low given China’s favorable debt profile.
China’s public debt sustainability analysis (DSA) is based on the following assumptions:


Public debt coverage. Two definitions of government debt are used. General government debt
includes central government debt and local government bonds.1 Augmented debt adds other types of
local government borrowing, including off-budget borrowing by Local Government Financing Vehicles
(LGFVs) via bank loans, bonds, trust loans and other funding sources. The augmented deficit is the flow
counterpart of augmented debt. Augmented fiscal data are a complement to general government
data. Since some nongovernment activity is included, the augmented debt and deficit estimates
should be viewed as an upper bound.



Macroeconomic assumptions:
The projection reflects a gradual slowdown of real GDP growth to a more sustainable level and low
inflation. In the baseline, growth converges to 6.3 percent by 2020 though is lower in some of the
intervening years. Inflation is projected to drop to 0.4 percent in 2016 and then rise to 2 percent over
the medium term.



1

Fiscal assumptions:


Fiscal balance assumptions. In line with the authorities’ gradual withdrawal of fiscal stimulus, the
augmented fiscal deficit is projected to decline from around 10 percent of GDP in 2015 to around
8 percent of GDP by 2020. Local government expenditure to GDP ratio is projected to decline. This
is due to: (i) lower expenditure financed by net land sales; and (ii) the authorities’ reforms to limit
local government borrowing. Meanwhile, the general government net borrowing is projected to
increase slightly due to the shift from off-budget spending to on-budget spending.



Local government financing. While many local governments relied on net revenue from land sales
and LGFV borrowing to finance their investment in the past, the DSA assumes that future financing
needs will be met by bond issuance, in line with the authorities’ reform plan and recent progress
on local government bond issuance. Three bond types are assumed: (i) central government
bonds; (ii) local government bonds, and (iii) a separate bond to repay existing local government
debt according to amortization scheme in the NAO 2013 report.

It corresponds to “General government debt if incl. only LG bonds (excl. swap)” in Table 5.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

75

PEOPLE’S REPUBLIC OF CHINA



Interest rates and amortization. The interest rates for central government and local government
bonds are assumed to follow the historical pattern. The interest rates of local government bonds
are assumed to be higher than central government bonds. The amortization profile is not central
to the analysis because we assume all maturing debt is rolled over and that all debt is subject to a
variable interest rate.

In the baseline, China’s general government debt is on a declining path, but augmented debt
continues to rise.


The general government debt is slightly above 20 percent of GDP over the projection periods.
Augmented debt, however, rises to about 71 percent of GDP in 2020 from less than 57 percent of
GDP in 2014. Even with the favorable interest rate-growth differential, augmented debt rises over
the medium term as the augmented deficit is assumed to decline gradually. The drag on growth
from fiscal consolidation will thus spread out to provide time for growth enhancing structural
reforms to take hold.



The projected general government and augmented debt-to-GDP ratios are higher than in the
2014 DSA. This reflects that the baseline now assumes larger fiscal deficits, lower inflation, and
slower growth than in the 2014 DSA.

China faces relatively low risks to debt sustainability, but is vulnerable to contingent liability
shocks.


General government debt remains relatively low and on a stable path in all standard stress tests
except for the scenario with contingent liability shocks. A contingent liability shock in 2016 will
result in a sharp increase in debt level from about 19 percent of GDP in 2015 to about 41 percent
of GDP in 2016.2 While the debt level is manageable, the authorities would potentially have to
deal with an increase in gross financing needs that could be sensitive to market financing
condition. Without any extra fiscal consolidation, the debt-to-GDP ratio will stay around
44 percent of GDP over the medium term under a contingent liability shock. A real GDP growth
shock—with growth in 2016 and 2017 each 2 percentage points lower than in the baseline—
would have a minimal impact on government debt (2020 debt-to-GDP ratio would be around
25 percent compared to 22 percent in the baseline scenario).



The augmented debt level is also sensitive to a contingent liability shock, which would push debt
to near 100 percent of GDP in 2020. Such a shock, for instance, could be a large-scale bank
recapitalization or financial system bailout to deal, for example, with a potential rise in NPLs from
deleveraging. A combined macrofiscal shock would increase the debt-to-GDP ratio from about
71 percent to 78 percent in 2020.

Mechanically, the standard contingent liability shock in IMF DSA toolkit assumes that 10 percent of banking system
assets stock would turn into government liabilities. The banking system assets stock is slightly above 205 percent of
GDP in 2014.



Overall, China’s debt profile is favorable as most of the public debt is financed through a domestic
investor base, and the small external debt is mostly from official creditors. In addition, the DSA
focuses on gross debt. The analysis thus ignores that China has considerable state assets, including
around US$4 trillion in foreign exchange reserves and sizable equity holdings in state owned
enterprises (many of which are listed on domestic and international stock exchanges).

1/ Public sector is defined as general government.
2/ Based on available data.
3/ Long-term bond spread over U.S. bonds.
4/ Defined as interest payments divided by debt stock (excluding guarantees) at the end of previous year.
5/ Derived as [(r - π(1+g) - g + ae(1+r)]/(1+g+π+gπ)) times previous period debt ratio, with r = interest rate; π = growth rate of GDP deflator; g = real GDP growth rate;
a = share of foreign-currency denominated debt; and e = nominal exchange rate depreciation (measured by increase in local currency value of U.S. dollar).
6/ The real interest rate contribution is derived from the numerator in footnote 5 as r - π (1+g) and the real growth contribution as -g.
7/ The exchange rate contribution is derived from the numerator in footnote 5 as ae(1+r).
8/ Includes asset changes and interest revenues (if any). For projections, includes exchange rate changes during the projection period.
9/ Assumes that key variables (real GDP growth, real interest rate, and other identified debt-creating flows) remain at the level of the last projection year.

Appendix IV. Global Risk Assessment Matrix
Main Sources of Risks

Persistent dollar
strength

Global

Overall Level of Concern
Likelihood (over next one to five years)
High
With U.S. economic prospects continuing to improve while dimming
elsewhere, the dollar has appreciated significantly against the euro,
yen, and many emerging market currencies. If these divergences in
outlook continue to build the dollar could surge rapidly and stay
elevated.

Impact and Policy Response
Medium
The impact would depend on what happens to the renminbi. If it appreciated in
REER terms in line with the stronger U.S. dollar, then it would reduce growth
mainly through lowere exports as a result of a loss of competitiveness.
Policy response : Allow for a more flexible, market-determined exchange rate.
This would likely result in less REER appreciation. If near-term growth were to
slow too sharply, then fiscal stimulus should be used in a manner that supports
rebalancing and helps protect vulnerable groups.

Medium
Sustained decline in New sources of supply, such as shale gas and a ramping up of
production in some emerging economies may generate global excess
commodity prices
capacity, while global demand remains weak.
over the medium
term

Medium
A sustained decline of commodities prices over a period of several years could
benefit China, which is a large importer of natural resources.
Policy response : Advance structural reforms to accelerate the transition
towards a greener, more inclusive, and sustainable growth. This could include
opportunistically accerlating the hike in resources taxes, as was done with
petroleum taxes during the recent fall in oil prices.

High
Lower-than-anticipated growth and persistently low inflation in
advanced economies due to a failure to fully address legacies of the
financial crisis would lead to secular stagnation, and potentially
Protracted period of complicate efforts on rebalancing and restoring fiscal sustainability.
slower growth in
advanced economies

High

Sharp slowdown in
2015-16

External trade would be affected due to the slower recovery of global demand.
Capacity utilization rates in export sectors would decline, leading to a fall in
profitability, rising unemployment, and diminished ability to service corporate
debt. A deterioration in banks’ asset quality, together with tighter financing
conditions, would further slow investment and growth.
Policy response : Advance structural reforms to accelerate the transition
towards a greener, more inclusive, and sustainable growth. If near-term growth
were to slow too sharply, then fiscal stimulus should be used in a manner that
supports rebalancing and helps protect vulnerable groups.

Low
Growth falls significantly below target, possibly due to a severe
housing downturn or a shock in the shadow banking sector, and absent
offsetting stimulus.

High
Such a shock could trigger a negative feedback loop between real activity, bank
asset quality, lending, and local government finances .
Policy response : If near-term growth were to slow too sharply, then fiscal
stimulus should be used in a manner that supports rebalancing and helps
protect vulnerable groups.

Medium
Insufficient progress with reforms leads to a continued buildup of
vulnerabilities, which over the medium term results in a significant
growth slowdown.

High
Main impact would be through continued resource misallocation, leading to
significant TFP slowdown and overall potential growth in the medium term.
Policy response : Advance structural reforms to accelerate the transition
towards a more balanced and sustainable growth path.

Exchange Arrangements:
China’s exchange rate regime has been classified as a crawl-like arrangement since June 21, 2010.
De jure classification of the exchange rate is managed floating. On July 21, 2005, the People’s Bank
of China (PBC) announced that the exchange rate of the renminbi against the U.S. dollar would be
revalued upward by about 2.1 percent (from RMB 8.28/US$ to RMB 8.11/US$) and the exchange
rate regime would move to a managed float in which renminbi’s value is set with reference to a

2

PEOPLE’S REPUBLIC OF CHINA

basket of currencies. The stated intention of the Chinese authorities was to increase the flexibility of
the renminbi’s exchange rate. The authorities indicated that they will not publish the currencies in
the reference basket and their relative weight. The PBC indicated that it would adjust the exchange
rate trading band as necessary to reflect market developments and financial and economic
conditions. Under the new regime, the band around the daily trading price of the U.S. dollar against
the renminbi was kept at ± 0.3 percent around the central parity published by the PBC while the
trade prices of the non-U.S. dollar currencies against the renminbi were allowed to move within a
certain band announced by PBC, which was initially set at ±1.5 percent and increased to ±3 percent
in September 2005. In August 2005, the governor of PBC revealed that U.S. dollar, euro, Japanese
yen, and Korean won were the main currencies included in the basket; and U.K. pound, the Thai
baht, and the Russian ruble were among other currencies included in the basket. In May 2007, the
band around the daily trading price of the U.S. dollar against the renminbi was widened
to ± 0.5 percent. After maintaining the renminbi closely linked to the U.S. dollar between July
2008 and June 2010, the PBC announced on June 19, 2010 a return to the managed floating
exchange rate regime prevailing prior the global financial crisis with the exchange rate allowed to
move up to 0.5 percent from a central parity rate to enhance the effectiveness of monetary policy.
As of today, the band has been widened to 2 percent, allowing daily fluctuations relative to the
central parity rate. The trading prices for the RMB against the euro, Japanese yen, pound sterling,
Australian dollar, Canadian dollar, and New Zealand dollar float within a 3 percent range of the
current day’s middle exchange rates for the RMB against these currencies. The trading prices
against the Malaysian ringgit and the Russian ruble float within a 5 percent range of the current
day’s middle exchange rates of the RMB against these currencies. The trading price of the RMB
against the Thai baht in regional interbank markets floats within a 10% range of the reference price.
On January 4, 2006, over-the-counter (OTC) trading of spot foreign exchange was introduced with
15 banks initially designated as market makers. The number of market makers has since risen
to 31 with all the banks approved as spot market makers, and 27 approved as forward and swap
trading market makers by the end of 2014. The centralized spot foreign exchange trading system
(CFETS) remains operative, but its central parity rate (renminbi against the U.S. dollar) is now based
on a weighted average of CFETS and OTC transactions. Under the new system, CFETS first inquires
prices from all market makers before the opening of the market on each business day, exclude the
highest and lowest offers, and then calculates the weighted average of the remaining prices in the
sample as the central parity for the renminbi against the U.S. dollar for the day. The weights for the
market makers, which remain undisclosed, are determined by the CFETS using various factors,
including the transaction volumes of the respective market makers in the market. The method for
determining is as follows: The CFETS determines the middle rate for the renminbi against the ringgit,
yen, and the ruble similarly. The middle exchange rates of the renminbi against the euro and Hong
Kong dollar, and pound sterling, respectively, are determined through cross rates by the CFETS
based on the day’s foreign exchange middle rate for the renminbi against the U.S. dollar and the
exchange rates for the U.S. dollar against the euro, yen, Hong Kong dollar, and pound sterling on
international foreign exchange markets.

China accepted the obligations of Article VIII, Sections 2, 3, and 4 of the Fund’s Articles of
Agreement on December 1, 1996. There are repatriation requirements on proceeds from exports
and from invisible transactions and current transfers. Starting on August 13, 2007, all enterprises
(domestic institutions) having foreign exchange revenue from current operations may keep foreign
exchange receipts according to their operational needs in their current foreign exchange accounts.
With SAFE approval or registration, domestic institutions may open foreign exchange capital
accounts and retain foreign exchange revenues from capital transactions. Domestic institutions that
had no current foreign exchange revenue may purchase foreign exchange for imports in advance
based on documentary proof of the payment and deposit the funds into their foreign exchange
accounts. Individuals may, also open foreign exchange savings accounts and deposit foreign
exchange purchased in accordance with the relevant regulations. There are no measures currently in
force that have been determined to be exchange restrictions subject to Fund jurisdiction. However,
China has notified measures to the Fund, pursuant to procedures under the Executive Board
Decision 144-(52/51), which apply to measures imposed solely for national or international security
reasons.
Exchange controls continue to apply to most capital transactions. Effective on July 1, 2006, quotas
on foreign exchange purchases for foreign direct investment (FDI) were abolished, and domestic
investors were allowed to purchase foreign exchange to finance pre-FDI activities. Since
December 1, 2002, qualified foreign institutional investors (QFIIs) have been allowed to invest
domestically in A shares, subject to certain restrictions, and all nonresidents have been allowed to
purchase B shares, which are denominated in U.S. dollars or Hong Kong dollars. The overall
investment limit for QFIIs was US$150 billion in 2014. As of the end of 2014, a cumulative total of
251 QFIIs had been approved, with a total investment limit of US$49.701billion. The Qualified
Domestic Institutional Investor (QDII) scheme was introduced in 2004, and measures have since
been taken to promote its development. Since May 1, 2006, residents can freely purchase up to
US$20,000 foreign exchange and this limit was raised to US$50,000 in September 2006. Above this
amount, purchases require relevant documents. In May 2007, the QDII scheme was expanded to
allow qualified banks to invest retail funds in foreign equities. Effective July 5, 2007 the China
Securities and Regulatory Commission extended QDII to securities and fund-management
companies. The firms have to meet certain capital and other requirements. From April 2006,
qualified insurance companies were also allowed to invest their own foreign exchange externally
under the QDII scheme up to 15 percent of their total assets. QDIIs may also invest in foreign
derivative instruments.
The use of renminbi in international transactions has been expanded. In 2010, international financial
institutions were approved to raise funds domestically in renminbi for use offshore. Since August
2011, trade transactions between all provinces and cities in the Mainland with other countries may
be settled in renminbi. Since August 17, 2010, eligible foreign institutions may invest in the
interbank bond market in renminbi. The eligible institutions include foreign banks engaged in
cross-border trade settlements in renminbi, the Hong Kong SAR and Macao SAR region renminbi
clearing banks, and foreign central banks and monetary authorities. These investments are subject
to limits, but there is no minimum holding period. Starting from January 6, 2011, resident

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

PEOPLE’S REPUBLIC OF CHINA

enterprises in 20 provinces and cities in the Mainland may use renminbi for outward FDI in those
countries which accept such settlement. In December 2011, a new pilot scheme was announced to
allow up to RMB20 billion in portfolio flows into the securities markets (through a renminbi
Qualified Foreign Institutional Investor scheme), and in October, rules were published to allow
overseas firms to invest renminbi raised offshore in the Mainland as foreign direct investment. Since
2012 all residents and nonresidents can use RMB for FDI. RMB qualified foreign institutional
investors (RQFIIs) may invest in domestic securities markets. Under the expanded RMB qualified
foreign institutional investors (RQFII) scheme, Hong Kong subsidiaries of Chinese financial
institutions, as well as financial institutions registered and operated in Hong Kong SAR, may invest in
domestic securities markets using RMB proceeds raised overseas. RMB clearing banks were or will
be established in Singapore, Taiwan Province of China, France, Canada, Luxembourg, Australia,
Germany, Korea, and the UK.
As of 2014, resident-associated companies of multinational corporations may directly lend to
overseas-associated enterprises within a certain limit; they may also provide loans to overseasassociated enterprises through domestic banks. Foreign loans to domestic institutions, with a
maturity of more than one year, are subject to NDRC approval. Short-term external borrowings are
subject to the limits of SAFE approval. All external borrowing must be registered with the SAFE.
Article IV Consultation:
China is on the standard 12-month consultation cycle. The 2014 Article IV mission was concluded on
June 5, 2014 and the staff report was published on July 30, 2014.
Technical Assistance:
Technical assistance provided from 2001 through September 2015 is summarized in Annex V.
Resident Representative:
The resident representative office in Beijing was opened in October 1991. Mr. Alfred Schipke is the
Senior Resident Representative and Mr. Waikei Raphael Lam is the Deputy Resident Representative.

WORLD BANK-IMF COLLABORATION
(As of June26, 2015)
1.
The IMF China Resident Representatives held discussions with the World Bank team in
May 2015 to exchange views on key areas of reform to ensure sustainable medium-term growth in
China, minimize risks, and improve the inclusiveness of growth. The teams discussed their agendas for
2015-16. The last such meeting was held during December 2014 in Beijing.
2.
The teams agreed the focus of reform in China should be on shifting growth to a more
balanced and sustainable path, along the line of the Third Plenum reform blueprint. Reforms
should aim at preventing further buildup of risks stemming from rapid credit growth and quasi-fiscal
spending, and move the economy to a more inclusive, environment-friendly, and sustainable growth
path. Giving the market a more decisive role, eliminating distortions, and strengthening institutions
will result in a more efficient use of resources, faster productivity growth, and rising living standards
across the income spectrum.
3.

Based on this assessment, teams identified the following reform areas as macro-critical:



Financial sector reforms. Further progress in financial sector reform is central to containing
risks and boosting growth by facilitating better allocation of resources. Widespread implicit
guarantees—of savers, intermediaries, and borrowers—and the cap on deposit rates distort the
pricing of risk and borrowing costs, resulting in misallocation of credit and inefficient
investment. Key measures in this area include deposit interest rate liberalization, stepped-up
supervision and regulation of the financial system and overhaul of the system of resolving failed
financial institutions. In addition, stronger measures to monitor and regulate the large shadow
banking sector should be taken. Renewed focus on reforming the role of the state in the financial
sector should be made, with particular emphasis on the governance of state financial institutions.
More effective mechanisms to be put into place to ensure a functional crisis management framework
is in place and more coordinated macroprudential monitoring is implemented. And there is a need
to continue to push for innovations to facilitate greater financial inclusion for those households and
businesses not served by the formal financial markets.



Fiscal reforms. Off-budget spending, in infrastructure but also in other areas, undertaken by local
government-owned entities have led to a significant buildup of debt. Bringing these projects
on-budget and strengthening control over public financial management will help control fiscal risks.
Improving the fiscal framework is a priority for the medium term, including strengthening budget
processes, data transparency, local government finances, and medium-term budget planning. Tax
reforms—many of them planned and some already partly in place or in pilot form—will promote
more efficient and inclusive growth. These reforms include extending the VAT to services,
improving the progressivity of the personal income tax, and implementing a property tax.

6

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

PEOPLE’S REPUBLIC OF CHINA



Reform of social safety nets. Further strengthening the pension and health insurance
systems—including by improving adequacy and expanding coverage—would have macrobenefits such as reducing precautionary household savings. It is also crucial to improve benefit
portability across provinces and economic sectors. Reforms should be done in a way that
ensures the sustainability of the social security system, including through parametric changes to
the pension system and transferring the welfare and legacy components to the budget.



SOE reform. Reforms include opening up to full and fair competition activities currently
reserved to SOEs, properly pricing finance and other factor inputs, requiring adequate dividend
payments to the budget, and imposing hard budget constraints. Opening up the service sector
to more competition will also be critical for generating the productivity gains necessary to fuel
growth and for boosting household income, as services tend to be more labor intensive than
industry.



Green growth. Air pollution, water quality and supply, and issues such as desertification,
dependence on coal, and degradation of grasslands have social, health, and economic effects.
Underpricing of energy and inadequate consequences for pollution have worsened these effects
while contributing to China’s dependence on industry. Raising these factor costs to capture the
cost of externalities and investing in renewable energy will make growth more sustainable and
inclusive. This will also require mobilization of private capital and utilize the capital markets to
support green investments.



Infrastructure. Investment in infrastructure has been a key driver of the Chinese economy,
particularly during the slowdown around the Global Financial Crisis. However, the rapid pace of
investment has in some cases left communities behind, and in other cases has led to excessive
investment in projects with relatively low social or financial returns. Filling in the gaps of investment
in social projects will make growth more inclusive while improving the overall social and financial
efficiency of infrastructure investment. Measures to improve the process of approving new
infrastructure projects will ensure that investments are focused in areas of the highest social return.

4.

The teams agreed to the following division of labor.



Financial sector reforms. The Bank is working with the authorities on the development of a
financial sector reform strategy. The Fund will continue to follow up on the recommendations of the
2011 FSAP and provide technical assistance to the Chinese authorities as needed.



Fiscal reforms. The Bank will continue to work with the Ministry of Finance (MOF) to help in
implementing key reforms in public finance in the context of a proposed fiscal technical assistance
investment project. The Fund will continue its technical cooperation on the fiscal framework and
budgetary preparation, including strengthening the medium-term macro and fiscal framework,
enhancing local government borrowing monitoring, and modernizing accounting and treasury
management. The Fund will also continue to discuss the near- and medium-term implications of
China’s fiscal stance and policy choices on the broader economy as well as implications for global
spillovers.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

7

PEOPLE’S REPUBLIC OF CHINA



Social safety nets. The Bank will continue to work with the Chinese authorities on reforms to
improve the equity, sustainability, and portability of the Chinese pension system. This includes
helping provincial governments in developing more centralized information systems. The Bank will
also work with MOF to optimize fiscal risk management associated with social security liabilities in
the context of the fiscal technical assistance investment project. The Fund will look at issues related
to the how different social insurance schemes (including pensions and health care) fit into the
medium-term fiscal and macroeconomic policy framework. The Fund will also review the balance
between benefits and financing from different revenue sources, including social contributions and
other revenue.



Green growth. The Bank’s focus on climate change and renewable energy in China will continue to
emphasize cutting-edge renewable energy technologies, scale-up of energy conservation and
investments in energy efficiency, and green building policies (for heat and energy efficiency).
Engagements with a climate change focus will extend to expansion of distribution of electricity from
natural gas generation, analysis of carbon capture and storage potential, and development of carbon
markets. The Fund will continue to discuss options to capture the cost of externalities through the
use of fiscal policy such as better calibration of excise and other taxes. It is ready to provide
assistance on shifting the pricing and taxation of energy, and discussing the growth and fiscal
implications of such a shift.

5.

Teams have the following requests for information from their counterparts:



The Fund team requests to be kept informed of progress in the above macroeconomic structural
reform areas, as milestones are reached and at least on a semiannual basis.



The Bank team requests to be kept informed of the Fund’s assessments of macroeconomic policies
and prospects in the context of the Article IV consultation and staff visits, and at least semiannually.

The following table lists the teams’ separate and joint work programs for June 2015–June 2016.

RELATIONS WITH THE ASIAN DEVELOPMENT BANK1
1.
The Asian Development Bank’s (AsDB) partnership with the People’s Republic of China (PRC)
has grown in many ways since the PRC became a member of AsDB in March 1986. The PRC is AsDB’s
second largest shareholder among regional members and the third largest overall, as well as an
important middle-income country client. By the end of 2014, the PRC’s cumulative borrowing from
AsDB reached $29.35 billion with 215 loans for public sector projects. Of the total public sector loans,
56.8 percent was allocated to the transport sector, followed by agriculture and natural resources
(11 percent) and water and other municipal infrastructure services (12.8 percent), energy
(12.5 percent), industry and trade (2.3 percent), finance (2.3 percent), education (0.5 percent) and
multisector (1.7 percent). Over the past 27 years, AsDB has helped finance 27 private sector projects
in the PRC totaling $4.96 billion. AsDB also funds technical assistance for the PRC. By the end of
2014, AsDB had provided a total of $446.933 million for 714 technical assistance projects, consisting
of $139.956 million for preparing projects and $306.977 million for policy advice and capacity
development.
2.
Overall, the PRC has demonstrated strong capabilities in implementing projects. The good
performance shows the strong sense of project ownership among agencies involved in the design,
implementation, and management of projects, as well as the rigorous screening process for
development projects, particularly those proposed for external financing. Loan disbursement and
contract award performance is good.
3.
The PRC has demonstrated its strong partnership with AsDB by contributing to the Asian
Development Fund, establishing the $20 million PRC Poverty Reduction and Regional Cooperation
Fund (the PRC Fund), and replenishing another $20 million to the PRC Fund. The PRC Fund—the first
fund established in AsDB by a developing member country—providing technical assistance projects
to support subregional cooperation initiatives, particularly Central Asia Regional Economic
Cooperation (CAREC) and Greater Mekong Subregion (GMS) programs.
4.
The Asian Development Bank’s Country Partnership Strategy (CPS) 2011–2015 was
endorsed by AsDB Board of Directors in May 2012. The CPS 2011–2015 is aligned with the priorities
of the PRC’s 12th Five-Year Plan 2011–15 that intersect with those of AsDB’s long-term Strategy
2020, particularly the redoubling of efforts to promote socially inclusive and environmentally
sustainable development. The CPS reflects the PRC’s changing circumstances as a rapidly growing
middle-income country with increasing emphasis on innovation and value addition and South-South
cooperation to underpin the evolving AsDB-PRC partnership. The CPS is built on three strategic
pillars: (i) inclusive growth, (ii) environmentally sustainable growth, and (iii) regional cooperation and
integration. It identifies four priority sectors for country operations during the CPS period: (i) energy,
(ii) natural resources and agriculture, (iii) transport, and (iv) urban development. The sector selection

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

PEOPLE’S REPUBLIC OF CHINA

reflects AsDB’s comparative strengths and expertise through its longstanding operations in these
sectors.
5.
Projected public sector lending in 2014–2016 will total about $4.13 billion, of which
32 percent will support the transport sector; 27 percent for agriculture, rural development, and
natural resource management; 30 percent for urban development, water supply, and sanitation
improvement; and 11 percent for the energy sector. Over 90 percent of the projects are located in the
western, central and north-eastern regions in line with the CPS’s priorities of promoting inclusive
growth and environmentally sustainable growth.
6.
AsDB’s technical assistance will complement the lending program to improve the sector
policy environment, support governance and capacity development, and strengthen the knowledge
base and innovative features of lending operations.

STATISTICAL ISSUES
Assessment of Data Adequacy for Surveillance
1.
Data provision has some shortcomings, but is broadly adequate for surveillance. Priorities for
improvement include national accounts and government finance statistics. Progress has been made
in meeting the SDDS standard, as most of data requirements are observed although several data
categories are compiled but not disseminated in accordance to the SDDS standard (for instance, the
quarterly GDP is compiled on a cumulative and not a discrete basis). Some planned improvements
include strengthening the data dissemination by the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS), and revising
the reporting codes and classification of BOP transactions to Balance of Payments and International
Investment Position Manual, Sixth edition (BPM6) by the State Administration of Foreign Exchange
(SAFE). For a fuller discussion planned improvements see
(http://dsbb.imf.org/Pages/GDDS/SummaryReport.aspx?ctycode=CHN&catcode=s1)
Real Sector Statistics
2.
The National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) compiles and disseminates annual GDP by activity in
current and constant prices (2010) and quarterly estimates of GDP. Both the annual accounts and
quarterly accounts are based on the System of National Accounts, 1993 (1993 SNA). The techniques
for deriving volume measures of GDP are not sound and need to be improved. GDP by expenditure
is compiled at current and constant prices, but the constant price estimates are not published. Data
on the expenditure components of GDP are not available on a quarterly basis. Nevertheless, the NBS
has made a number of improvements to the range and quality of national accounts data, the most
important being improving the exhaustiveness of the GDP estimates by activity. Further
improvements are intended for both the annual and quarterly accounts, however, no target dates
have been set. As in other countries, rapid economic change, including the expansion of the private
sector, presents new problems for data collection and compilation. The ability to change the data
collection systems is restricted by the decentralized nature of the statistical system.
3.
Monthly industrial production, retail sales, and fixed investment indices are compiled with
the corresponding month of the previous year as a base period but, no chain-linked indices are
produced. Data revisions tend to be made without publishing the entire revised series.
4.
Labor market statistics—including employment and wage data—are not comprehensive, and
are only available on a quarterly basis.
5.
In January 2001, the NBS began to publish a Laspeyres price index that provides a time
series for each January to December including last month=100, same month of preceding year=100,
and same period of preceding year=100. This more accurately reflects consumer spending patterns
(e.g., the weight of services increased, while the weight of food declined). The number of survey
items has been expanded to at least 600 for small cities and counties and more for large and
medium-size cities (e.g., 1800 for Beijing). The most recent weights of the major CPI components
were provided to the staff in 2006.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

PEOPLE’S REPUBLIC OF CHINA

Government Finance Statistics
6.
Serious data shortcomings continue to hamper fiscal analysis. Data on the social security and
extra budgetary funds are only provided annually and with a long lag. Expenditure classification
remains in need of improvement, mainly because data by economic type are not published. The
authorities have indicated an intention to begin collecting these data and to develop accrual based
measures of fiscal performance over the medium term while also strengthening the compilation of
cash based GFS.
Monetary and Financial Statistics
7.
In recent years, improvements have been made in monetary and financial statistics.
However, the monetary and banking surveys lack sufficient detail with regard to bank claims on the
government, hampering the estimation of the fiscal deficit from the financing side. The reported net
foreign assets position of PBC does not include exchange rate valuation effects and interest earnings
on foreign reserves. The PBC has also ceased to report separate data on central government
deposits in its balance sheet since April 2005 because the MOF no longer distinguishes between
central and other government deposit accounts. This change has led to breaks in data series of
monetary base and monetary aggregates.
8.
The monetary and financial statistics missions in March 2015 made several
recommendations for improvements in monetary data compilation with a view to accelerating PBC’s
implementation of the standardized report forms (SRFs). The authorities plan to finalize the SRF data
for depository corporations by the end of 2015 and begin regular reporting of SRF data after PBC’s
review and approval process of these data is complete.
9.
With regards to financial soundness indicators (FSIs), the authorities expanded the data
scope in early 2015 by including two encouraged FSIs for deposit takers in their regular reporting to
the Fund.
External Sector Statistics
10.
The data are compiled (in U.S. dollars) largely in accordance with the fifth edition of the
Balance of Payments Manual (BPM5). From 2015, the data are complied largely in accordance with the
sixth edition of the Balance of Payments and International Investment Position Manual (BPM6). The
authorities continue their efforts to improve the coverage of direct investment transactions in the
balance of payments (BOP) and IIP statistics, and progress is being made in developing these
statistics. Since the International Transactions Reporting System is the major data source for balance
of payments (BOP) statistics, in order to ensure its smooth operation, regular training programs for
staff in the provincial offices of SAFE have been recommended. In 2011, China commenced
participation in the Coordinated Direct Investment Survey (CDIS), although only inward direct
investment positions are currently recorded.

14

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

PEOPLE’S REPUBLIC OF CHINA

11.
Despite an ostensibly modest level of external vulnerability, there remains a need to
strengthen external debt monitoring and compilation. In 2010, China started submitting total and
public external debt data for the Quarterly External Debt Statistics (QEDS) database, a notable step
forward.

Data Standards and Quality
12.

China has participated in the General Data Dissemination System since April 2002, and the

metadata posted on the Fund’s Dissemination Standards Bulletin Board (DSBB) are regularly
updated.

Data Reporting to STA for Publications
13.
Despite improvements in reporting a number of breaks remain in the series, and comparable
historical data are not available. Reporting of data to STA for publication in the International
Financial Statistics (IFS) has, in the past, tended to be sporadic and with a considerable time lag.
Long time series for the consumer and producer price indices and industrial production levels are
not available, although the comparison is made and available for each period with the same period
of the previous year. However, the range of information is relatively limited, with no data published
on wages, trade volumes, or prices/unit values.
14.
China has reported general government cash-based budget data for 2003–09 following the
GFSM 2001 methodology for publication in the 2011 Government Finance Statistics Yearbook.
However, these data are limited, with no data provided on government transactions in expense,
assets, and liabilities. The revenue classification does not fully distinguish between revenue and
grants, tax and nontax revenue, and current and capital revenue. The presentation of expenditure by
function is largely aligned with international best practice.
15.
Owing to source data issues, the authorities have not yet been able to report a GFSM 2001
Statement of Sources and Uses of Cash for the budgetary central government accounts on a
subannual basis. As a result, there are no fiscal data for China on the Principal Global Indicators
website.
16.
For reporting monetary data to the Fund, the authorities have not begun using SRFs.
Monetary data continue to be reported using the old format.
17.
The FSIs data currently posted on IMF’s website are available for all core indicators and two
encouraged FSIs on an annual basis with data beginning from 2010. The April 2012 mission
encouraged the authorities to compile and report the FSI data with quarterly periodicity. The
authorities agreed with the improved periodicity for their FSI data, but indicated that they would
prefer to move to semi-annual reporting prior to compiling the quarterly data.
18.
The monthly time series on international reserves for publication in the IFS are now
submitted on a timely basis. With regards to BOP and IIP data, the authorities started submitting

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

15

PEOPLE’S REPUBLIC OF CHINA

quarterly data to STA for publication in the IFS and the Balance of Payments Statistics Yearbook (BOP
data are available on a quarterly basis starting in 2010 and IIP starting in 2011). Additionally, China
participates in the CDIS as mentioned above but not yet in the Coordinated Portfolio Investments
Survey (CPIS).
Data Dissemination to the Public
19.
The publication of a quarterly statistical bulletin by the PBC has significantly improved the
timing and coverage of publicly available data on the monetary accounts and the main real sector
indicators. However, the monthly statistical publications do not contain many time series
(e.g., unemployment) or the disaggregation necessary for analysis. Moreover, several important time
series, particularly on the main fiscal variables, are not released in a systematic and timely manner.
Extensive annual economic data are available in various statistical yearbooks, but these are
published nine months or more after the end of the year. Nevertheless, in the case of quarterly
external debt data disseminated in QEDS, time lag is around four to six months.

STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2015 ARTICLE IV
CONSULTATION—SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION

July 17, 2015

Prepared by

Asia and Pacific Department

This supplement provides additional information on developments since the staff report was finalized
in mid-June, with focus on the equity market, recent data releases, and monetary policy. This
information does not change the thrust of the staff appraisal and paragraph 6 of this supplement
adds the staff appraisal of recent developments.
Equity market
1. The equity market declined sharply starting in mid-June, giving back part of the preceding
rally, with ongoing volatility. In little more than a year, the market had risen by around 150 percent
through mid-June (see Box 4 in the staff report). It then dropped by over 30 percent in less than three
weeks, followed by some rebound after a broad set of measures were implemented to stabilize the
market. Despite the correction, the market as of July 17 was still up over 80 percent relative to April
2014. During the decline, many stocks had their trading suspended temporarily as they hit the
10-percent daily stop-loss limit or at the request of the company; at market trough on July 8 over
half of listed firms were not trading. In subsequent days, many companies resumed trading and the
number of listed firms reported as not trading dropped to about one-fourth of listed firms by July 17.
As of July 17, sizable volatility in stock indices and prices of individual firms continued. There was
some spillover to the foreign exchange market and Hong Kong SAR markets, albeit limited and short
lived so far.
2. The authorities responded with a range of measures to restore orderly market conditions
and stabilize the market. Initial steps in the first few days of the correction were perceived by many
market participants and observers as poorly coordinated and ineffective. They were then escalated to
a broad and powerful set of actions which included:


Providing liquidity. China Securities Finance Corporation (CSFC), which is the clearing house for
margin financing and stock lending, received liquidity with the assistance of the PBC, and
provided more liquidity to securities firms; margin rules were relaxed, including by expanding the
type of collateral to include real estate, and easing requirements for margin calls and liquidation
of margin loans.



Reducing selling pressure. Twenty-one securities firms pledged not to sell proprietary positions;
the regulator set a six-month ban on sales by large shareholders; margins for selling certain
futures were increased; and an investigation into suspicious short sellers was started.
Supporting new purchases. CSFC bought a wide range of stocks; big shareholders of listed



PEOPLE’S REPUBLIC OF CHINA

SOEs and mutual funds were encouraged to
buy stocks; the CBRC supported banks to
increase collateralized lending for equity
buybacks; and transaction fees were
lowered.

though from a low base; at its peak in mid-June
market estimates put it at 4‒6 percent of GDP. Since then, it has declined significantly, although
further unwinding is to be expected. Securities companies, the sector most exposed to losses
from an equity market decline and margin financing, on average have balance sheets strong
enough to absorb considerable losses. In addition, since they are a relatively small share of the
financial system, they are unlikely to pose systemic risks. Nevertheless, there is some uncertainty
about the extent of equity-related lending in shadow banking and the nonfinancial sector.
Hence, it is important that the authorities closely monitor—as they are now doing—
developments and potential spillovers.

4. Going forward, the authorities should curtail market intervention, focus on
maintaining the liquidity of systemically important institutions and groups of institutions,
and strengthen the framework for market regulation, supervision and crisis management.
The authorities’ actions signaled their determination to ensure orderly market conditions and
prevent excessive volatility and systemic financial risk. However, the heavy intervention created
risks exacerbating ‘moral hazard’ (fostering a perception of government support for a market
floor), and may raise questions about the system’s and policies’ market orientation. Thus, the
authorities’ strategy should now focus on maintaining orderly market conditions and confidence

in the stability of the system, without shoring up prices around a particular level. This approach
would involve exiting price support mechanisms and restoring price discovery and transparency
as soon as possible, irrespective of the impact on price levels. Systemically important institutions
(or groups of institutions) may need continued liquidity support in the short term, subject to
strict oversight and collateral requirements. Once conditions have calmed, exceptional measures
can be removed, combined with further strengthening the resilience of the financial system,
would support the goal of maintaining momentum towards a well-regulated, market-based
financial system. Improved coordination among relevant agencies, under clear leadership and
communication, will be key to effective and swift action in similar circumstances in the future.
5. Authorities’ views. The authorities emphasized that their response was focused on
preventing disorderly market conditions and excessive volatility, especially as large-scale
unwinding of margin positions risked triggering a negative feedback loop between declining
prices and margin calls. Looking ahead, they agreed that market regulation and supervision
needed to be vigilant against the build-up of risks, including large margin positions, and
expected the exceptional measures applied to stabilize the market to be phased out over time
as market conditions permitted.
Economic developments
6. Recent data suggest developments are broadly in line with staff’s forecast. GDP growth
in Q2 was 7.0 percent, which is somewhat higher than staff forecast (Figure 1). However, growth
in the second half of the year is likely to be somewhat weaker given the headwinds from recent
equity market turbulence, which could reduce the contribution to growth from financial services
and have some, even if small, impact on demand through wealth and confidence effects. Thus,
on balance, developments are consistent with the staff’s forecast for growth this year (6.8
percent) and the authorities’ target of around 7 percent. Headline and core CPI increased
modestly in June, while PPI inflation remained negative.

agreeed, that monetary and credit developments now appear to be on track toward achieving

GDP growth of around 7 percent for the year. Staff therefore considers that monetary policy
need not alter its course as a result of recent stock market developments, given their limited
systemic or macroeconomic impact. Regarding benchmark deposit rates, staff continues to
believe that the time has come to complete the liberalization of interest rates by removing the
deposit rate ceiling (staff report paragraph 39).
Staff appraisal
8. Policies following the recent correction in equity markets should aim to restore fully
functional market conditions as soon as possible. After a major rally over the past year, the
market corrected sharply in a short period of time. Initially less effective, the policy response
soon widened to a broad range of measures to restore orderly market conditions and stop the
decline. While the market appears to have stabilized for now, the measures reached far into
areas that involved the approval of companies’ requests to suspend trading, reducing sales, and
boosting purchases of stocks through public entities. This set of interventions needs to be
curtailed to permit a return to normal price discovery. Future interventions should focus on
restoring orderly market conditions, irrespective of the impact on price levels. The recent
episode has also highlighted the need to improve coordination among relevant agencies, under
clear leadership, and to communicate policy goals and actions early, clearly, and with a unified
voice.

Statement by Zhongxia Jin
Executive Director for People's Republic of China
July 22, 2015
On behalf of my authorities, I would like to thank staff for their constructive and candid
dialogue held during the mission. My authorities welcome staff’s thorough assessment of the
Chinese economy, and see merit in staff’s recommendations in several policy areas. Valuing
the Fund’s expertise and role in the international monetary system, my authorities will
continue to maintain close cooperation with staff going forward.
Recent economic developments
The Chinese economy is transiting to its new normal amidst an uneven and brittle global
economic recovery process. China’s real GDP growth edged down from 7.4 percent in 2014
to 7.0 percent in the first half of this year, which is still high compared to economies of
similar size. Labor market conditions remain firm amidst strengthening tertiary industry and
consumption, while new industries, such as e-business, have grown at a vibrant pace.
Meanwhile, price pressure in China remains subdued, mainly due to the moderation in food
price inflation, the substantial appreciation in the renminbi effective exchange rate, and the
decline in global oil and commodity prices. In particular, the y-o-y CPI inflation rate
moderated to 1.3 percent in the first half of this year from 2.0 percent in 2014, while the y-oy producer price inflation rate dropped to -4.6 percent from -1.9 percent over the same
period. With all that said, my authorities agree with staff that the risk of deflation in China
has been contained, given the firm core price and labor cost pressures, and the ample policy
space to guard against the risk.
My authorities will endeavor to foster new growth engines and upgrade traditional ones,
including through building up highly efficient markets for resource allocation, enhancing the
provision of public goods and services, and promoting innovation and industrial upgrading
by implementing the “Internet Plus” and “Made in China 2025” strategies. My authorities
will also continue to integrate China with the global economy through the implementation of
the “One Belt, One Road” strategy and new free trade agreements.
Fiscal policy
My authorities have proactively provided fiscal support to counter the downward pressure
facing the economy and promote inclusive growth. Spending on infrastructure investment,
environmental protection, healthcare, and other social expenditure all picked up, while tax
cuts and fee reductions were made to alleviate the burden on small and micro enterprises. The
budget deficit in 2015 is set to rise to 2.3 percent of GDP from the actual deficit of
2.1 percent of GDP in 2014.

2
With the general government debt level registering about 40 percent of GDP in 2014,
China’s fiscal indebtedness remains manageable, particularly after taking into account the
favorable interest rate-growth differential and strong government asset position. My
authorities continue to caution against staff’s augmented fiscal measures, given that such
measures also include the debt of local government financing vehicles operating on pure
commercial basis.
To harden budget constraint and safeguard fiscal sustainability and transparency, my
authorities amended the Budget Law and issued new guidelines, involving: (1) promulgating
the modality of local government debt issuance and repayment; (2) making it mandatory to
disclose budget information; (3) fine-tuning the management of local government debt, and;
(4) improving the performance assessment criteria of local governments; (5) promoting
public-private partnership (PPP) in infrastructure investment1; (6) developing an earlywarning system and contingency management mechanism; and, (7) introducing a multi-year
budget framework, which can reduce fiscal procyclicality.
In addition, my authorities have taken steps to improve the alignment of responsibilities
between the central and local governments by enhancing the fiscal transfer system and have
boosted budget efficiency. My authorities have also required both central and local
governments to reduce the amount of accumulated surplus carried over from the previous
years. Meanwhile, to address the funding pressures facing the local governments, my
authorities launched local government debt swaps amounting to RMB 3.0 trillion—which
have replaced the existing short-term and high interest rate commercial bank lending with
long-term and low-cost local government bonds.
Monetary policy
China’s monetary condition remains stable under a prudent monetary policy stance. Growth
in M2, RMB deposits, and nonbank financing have shifted to a low gear amidst the
strengthened regulation of interbank and nonbank businesses, reduced foreign exchange
inflows, and ongoing structural adjustments in the economy. Against the downward pressure
facing the economy, my authorities implemented a combination of both price- and quantitybased measures to ensure adequate liquidity and reasonable growth in credit and social
financing, including: (1) conducting open market operations (2) lowering the benchmark
lending rate and cutting the required reserve ratio; and, (3) adjusting the differentiated
reserve requirement. Thanks to these efforts, funding pressures have eased, while bank
lending, particularly to the rural sector and small and micro enterprises, continues to increase
at a firm pace.

As of May 25, 2015, 1043 PPP projects amounting to RMB 1.97 trillion had been revealed, covering areas
including transportation, water conservancy, and environmental protection.

3
With the proposed removal of the loan-to-deposit requirement, it is expected that the banking
sector can further strengthen its support to the real economy, and the stability of money market
will be improved. Recognizing the merit of an interest rate corridor in the interbank market,
my authorities will also continue to improve the interest rate transmission mechanism, so as to
transit eventually to a policy rate that is based on interbank market operations.
The significant progress made over the years has resulted in near-full interest rate
liberalization. Most interest rates had already been liberalized, and the SHIBOR has
increasingly become the benchmark for pricing financial products. Membership of the selfregulatory market interest-rate pricing mechanism has expanded, while interbank issuance
and trading of negotiable certificate of deposits has picked up. Marking another milestone in
the liberalization process, the deposit insurance scheme and negotiable certificates of deposit
for individual investors and nonfinancial corporate were launched recently. Thus, after raising
consecutively the deposit rate cap to the current level of 1.5 times the benchmark rate—with
anecdotal evidences suggesting that in many cases the cap is not binding—, conditions may
become ripe for completely removing the cap by the end of this year, which will then finish
the whole liberalization process.
Financial sector
The banking sector remains sound, thanks to strengthened capital level, stable return, and
reduced cost-to-income ratio. Notwithstanding a moderate pickup in nonperforming loans, the
regulator’s latest stress-testing results also indicated that the sector can withstand a wide
range of macrofinancial shocks—including severe credit shocks from local government
financing platforms, correction in the real estate sector, and off-balance sheet exposures.
According to the FSB’s latest estimate, the size of China’s shadow banking system remains
moderate in comparison to that in other major economies, as well as the size of the Chinese
economy2. The FSB’s latest peer review also recognized the notable progress made in
implementing the 2011 FSAP recommendations on strengthening the macroprudential
framework and regulating nonbank credit intermediaries.
My authorities have endeavored to improve the governance and the operational efficiency of
large commercial banks, and open up the sector for private participation with the successful
establishment of five private banks. My authorities have also approved reform plans and
provided funding support to the three policy banks, to strengthen their roles in providing
medium and long-term financing and supporting the agricultural and external sectors.
According to the FSB’s Global Shadow Banking Monitoring Report 2014, the size of China’s non-bank financial
intermediation amounted to USD 3.0 trillion as at end-2013, while that of the U.S. and the U.K. amounted to USD
25.2 trillion and USD 9.3 trillion respectively. Using the more narrower measure of shadow banking, the size of
China’s shadow banking amounted to USD 2.7 trillion as at end-2013, while that of the U.S. and the U.K.
amounted to USD 14.0 trillion and USD 4.7 trillion respectively.

4
It is worth noting that, with the banks’ lending rate being liberalized already; banks would
offer different lending rates in accordance with the credibility and risk profile of borrowers.
As SOEs are generally bigger and have higher credit rating than private firms, which are
mostly SMEs, the respective interest rate spreads would reflect mainly the risk premium of
the borrowers—as in other countries—and would not have much to do with the ownership
of the firms. As such, we strongly suggest staff to shift their analytical focus from a
simplified ownership concept to shareholding system of both commercial banks and
borrowers, their risk pricing and competition environment, in order to have a better
description of the interest rate development in China.
Asset market
The real estate market continues to adjust in an orderly manner. Due to a buildup of
inventory, the real estate market has moderated since 2014, bringing ramification to the real
economy. In view of these, my authorities relaxed the mortgage policy (for second-home
buyers), increased financial support to property market development, and expanded capitalgains tax exemption. As a result, signs of stabilization in the real estate market have emerged
in recent months. Going forward, my authorities will continue to recalibrate real estate
market policy as necessary, which, together with the ongoing urbanization and hukou
reforms, will be conducive to a healthy development in the market.
Despite some turbulence recently, the development of China’s stock market will continue on
the back of sound macroeconomic fundamentals. Amidst the start of interest rate cuts, and
rising margin financing, the Shanghai Composite Index recovered from its undervalued level
of about 2000 and eventually registered an increase of about 150 percent from its level in
July 2014. The subsequent warranted correction, however, is complicated by the acceleration
of the unwinding process. As such, my authorities implemented a series of conventional and
unconventional measures—which are in line with international practices while taking into
account country-specific circumstances—to restore market confidence, prevent a disorderly
unwinding of margin financing, and contain spillover. Since then, the market has stabilized,
and it is expected that once the market restores fully its norm, the unconventional measures
will be phased out.
The turbulence had limited systemic implication for either the real economy or the financial
system, as: (1) Chinese households allocated less than 10 percent of their wealth to equities,
and estimated stock market wealth effect in China was found to be small; (2) despite its rapid
growth, equity financing still accounts for less than 5 percent of total social financing; (3) the
total amount of money borrowed from the banking sector accounts for less than 2 percent of
total banking assets.
Going forward, my authorities will further identify and reduce market failure, improve crisis
response, strengthen the integration and coordination of the financial supervisory framework.

5
External sector
China’s external position remains broadly stable amidst a volatile external environment. The
current account surplus edged up to 2.8 percent of GDP in the first quarter of this year from
2.1 percent of GDP in 2014. Two-way movements in the RMB/USD exchange rate have
become more frequent, after repeated steps in widening the daily floating band. More
importantly, China has basically exited from its intraday interventions on the foreign
exchange market. Reflecting the fundamental role of the market force in the RMB exchange
rate formation mechanism, foreign reserves have moderated since the second half of 2014,
amidst outflows of capitals that offset the current account surplus.
Given the sizable 35% real appreciation of the RMB since 2005, the subdued current account
surplus, and emerging capital account deficit, there is little doubt that the RMB is no longer
undervalued. Thus, my authorities welcome the shift in the Fund’s view on the RMB’s
valuation. I would also encourage staff to continue to refine the External Balance Assessment
methodology and recognize that the size of China’s foreign reserves is broadly appropriate
against a backdrop of volatile capital flows, avoiding a mechanistic application of the Fund’s
reserve adequacy metric.
On the capital account, 35 out of the 40 capital account items are now fully or partially
convertible—according to the Fund’s latest Annual Report on Exchange Arrangements and
Exchange Restrictions—and it should be noted that summary indices of capital control (e.g.,
Chinn-Ito Index) cannot reflect the true picture of China’s capital account openness,
particularly since such indices do not take into consideration the continued expansion of
existing channels (i.e. cross-border investor programs) and the size of actual flows.
My authorities want to point out that the capital account opening process is gaining
momentum with the launch of the Shanghai-Hong Kong Stock Connect in 2014 being
followed by the launch of the mutual recognition of funds between China and Hong Kong
SAR, the launch of the Shanghai-Hong Kong Gold Connect, and the freer access of relevant
overseas institutional investors to the onshore interbank market.
At the same time, my authorities continue to broaden channels for RMB flows, including
through expanding the RMB Qualified Foreign Institutional Investor (RQFII) Program, and
introducing the RMB Qualified Domestic Institutional Investor (RQDII) Program. The RMB
is now the fifth most used global payment currency, the second most used currency in trade
financing, and the ninth most traded currency in the world.

6
China has embarked on a new round of trade liberalization, China (Shanghai) Pilot Free
Trade Zone (FTZ) was established in 2013, followed by the establishment of new FTZs in
Guangdong, Tianjin, and Fujian, After the recent signing of bilateral trade agreements
with Australia and Korea, China will continue to advance new free trade agreements and
promote the multilateral trade system. On the other hand, China’s overseas direct
investment surpassed foreign direct investment for the first time in 2014. My authorities
will continue to encourage overseas investment through implementing the “One belt, One
road” strategy3 and cooperate closely with the existing IFIs and the newly-established
Silk Road Fund, Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank as well as the New Development
Bank in helping address the infrastructure investment gap facing many countries.
Structural reform
Reflecting the transition to a more balanced and sustainable growth path, the tertiary sector
and consumption continue to strengthen its importance in the economy, while the central
and western regions continue to catch up with the eastern regions. Meanwhile, thanks to
my authorities’ steadfast efforts to strengthen the social safety net—including through
implementing the hokou reform and the new urbanization plans announced last year—the
urban-rural income inequality gap continues to narrow, while urban and rural saving rates
had declined over the past two years. At the same time, the private sector continues to
thrive, with the sector’s shares in fixed asset investment (excluding rural household),
goods exports, and bank loans to enterprises all increasing steadily over time to reach 4050 percent in the last two years.
On the environmental front, China’s forest coverage has continued to increase over the past
two decades, rising from less than 13 percent of total land area in early 1980s to 22.6
percent in 2012. Carbon emission per unit of GDP has been reduced by 33.8 percent since
2005. To further contribute to the global combat against climate change, my authorities had
recently pledged to cap carbon emissions by 2030 or earlier, raise the consumption share
of non-fossil fuels from the current 11.2 percent to about 20 percent, and cut carbon
emissions per unit of GDP by 60-65 percent from the corresponding level in 2005.
Finally, my authorities have recently started to release data on China’s foreign reserves in
accordance with the Special Data Dissemination Standard (SDDS). With comprehensive
technical preparation, conditions are ripe to subscribe to the SDDS by the end of this year.

3 The “One belt, One road" strategy refers to the New Silk Road Economic Belt, which will link China with
Europe through Central and Western Asia, and the 21st Century Maritime Silk Road, which will connect
China with Southeast and South Asian countries, Africa, Europe, and even other regions.
