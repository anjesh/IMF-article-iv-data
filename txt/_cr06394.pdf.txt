PEOPLE’S REPUBLIC OF CHINA
Staff Report for the 2006 Article IV Consultation
Prepared by the Staff Representatives for
the 2006 Consultation with the People’s Republic of China
Approved by David Burton and Anthony Boote
July 11, 2006
•

The 2006 Article IV discussions with China were held in Beijing, Shanghai, and Chongqing during
May 11–26, 2006.

•

The staff team comprised Mr. Dunaway (Head), Messrs. Aziz, Aitken, Leigh, and Ms. Cui (all
APD), Ms. Fedelino (FAD), Mr. Chamon (RES), Ms. Li (PDR), and Mr. Podpiera (MFD). The team
was assisted by Mr. Brooks (Senior Resident Representative) and Mr. Barnett (Resident
Representative). Mr. Xiaoyi Wang, Mr. Huayong Ge, and Ms. Fang Yang (OED) participated in the
discussions. Mr. Kato joined the mission on May 22–23.

•

The last Article IV consultation was concluded on August 3, 2005. (A summary of the Executive
Board discussion can be found at www.imf.org/external/pubs/cat/longres.cfm?sk=18709.0). In
recent years, the authorities and the Fund have agreed on policy priorities in a number of areas.
However, in many of these areas the authorities have favored more measured and gradual steps than
the Fund, reflecting their concerns about the risks that stronger and quicker actions might pose.
While improvements has been made in monetary policy operations, the authorities have
continued to rely on administrative measures to contain investment and credit growth. In part,
this reflects the authorities’ more gradual approach to introducing greater exchange rate flexibility.
The Fund has welcomed the change in the exchange rate arrangement, but it has encouraged the
authorities to utilize more fully the flexibility afforded by the new arrangement. At the same time,
fiscal consolidation has proceeded broadly in line with the Fund’s recommendations. In addition,
there is general agreement on a broad range of structural reforms, including in the banking sector,
the state-owned enterprises, and dealing with rural-urban income disparities. Differences of view
relate principally to the pace of implementing reforms.

•

While progress continues to be made in upgrading China’s economic statistics, weaknesses remain
in key areas. These include the national accounts, fiscal and labor statistics, and the balance of
payments. The authorities are making improvements in all of these areas, in particular by recently
publishing China’s international investment position. China has participated in the GDDS, with its
metadata posted on the official website (Dissemination Standards Bulletin Board) since April 2002.

•

China has accepted the obligations of Article VIII, Sections 2, 3, and 4 of the Articles of Agreement.
Exchange controls continue to apply to most financial account transactions.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
Economic Setting:
Economic activity remained strong in 2005 and the first five months of 2006. Based on revised
official data, GDP growth reached nearly 10 percent in 2005 and increased to 10¼ percent in
Q1 2006, led by investment and exports. Inflation remains subdued, running at 1½ percent in May.
The external current account surplus rose to more than 7 percent of GDP in 2005, and the trade
balance strengthened further in the first five months of 2006. This has led to a further large increase
in foreign official reserves, which amounted to $925 billion at end-May. Credit and money growth
have increased in recent months, prompting the authorities to take a number of monetary policy
actions and administrative measures to try to contain lending and investment growth, but the impact
of these measures remains to be seen. Strong revenue overperformance helped to bring down the
fiscal deficit by ¼ percentage point to 1¼ percent of GDP.
Policy changes are needed to address both domestic and external challenges. If China is to
sustain rapid and stable economic growth the economy needs to be rebalanced away from heavy
dependence on export-led growth toward self-sustaining domestic demand, and the opportunity to
share in the benefits of growth needs to be spread more equitably across all levels of society.
Policy Discussions:
The staff stressed the urgency of monetary policy actions to prevent a further acceleration of
investment. More steps need to be taken to drain excess liquidity from the system and contain credit
growth, including further intensification of open market operations together with additional increases
in reserve requirements and benchmark interest rates. The authorities agreed on the need for
containing investment growth, but maintained that legal and administrative measures were also
needed to contain growth in specific sectors where overinvestment was a concern.
The staff urged the authorities to increase exchange rate flexibility. This would allow greater
monetary policy control by alleviating the major conflict created by tightly managing the exchange
rate in the face of large capital inflows, thereby reducing the need to rely on financial repression. It
would also contribute to the sustainability of China’s growth over the medium term. The timing is
right given the strength of the Chinese economy, with further delay entailing additional costs, which
will grow over time. The authorities agreed that greater flexibility was needed over the medium term,
but stressed that exchange rate reform would proceed in a gradual and controlled manner.
The 2006 budget is generally appropriate from a near-term perspective. Fiscal consolidation has
created the space to step up social spending, which is needed to rebalance growth toward
consumption. However, the authorities agreed that in the absence of concrete plans and adequate
control measures, ad hoc or overly ambitious spending now that exceeds implementation capacity
would be wasteful. As plans are formulated and implementation capacity improved, social spending
can be ramped up over the medium term.
To facilitate rebalancing of the economy, financial sector reforms are needed to improve the
intermediation of China’s large private savings. The government also needs to raise social spending
in the areas of education, health care, and pensions, which will serve to reduce precautionary saving
and boost consumption over time.

the banking system is touching off a new
surge in lending and investment, with the probable consequence of creating new nonperforming loans (NPLs) and undoing some of the progress made in reforming the banking
sector. China’s increasing integration into the global economy also poses challenges. As
China’s export market share has continued to rise, frustration in many trading partner
countries with China’s slow pace of exchange rate appreciation has been mounting. This runs
the risk of exposing China to renewed protectionist measures. The gap between incomes of
rural and urban areas continues to widen, and concerns are emerging that reform may be
proceeding too fast, raising the risk that progress could stall if these concerns are not
addressed.
2.
Policy changes are needed to address both domestic and external challenges. If
China is to sustain rapid and stable economic growth the economy needs to be rebalanced
away from heavy dependence on export-led growth toward self-sustaining domestic demand,
and the opportunity to share in the benefits of growth needs to be spread more equitably
across all levels of society.
3.
The authorities are aware of these challenges. In the annual National People's
Congress held in March, the government stressed the need to improve the investment
structure, advance reforms in the health care, pension, and education systems, and provide
more support to the rural areas and the less-developed regions. These reforms are aimed at
boosting consumption by reducing precautionary savings. Along with policies to reduce
energy intensity of production, the government aims to support a growth strategy that is more
balanced than that in recent years (Box 1).

5

Box 1. Rebalancing Growth in China
Shifting the composition of growth away from exports and investment towards increased consumption is a key element of
the government’s overall strategy to rebalance growth.
Chinese households consumed less than 40 percent of
GDP in 2005. 1 However, this was not always the case. The
consumption-to-GDP ratio stood at 51 percent in 1980 when
the liberalization of China’s economy had just begun, but
has steadily declined since then. The decline is somewhat
surprising given that real consumption grew at an annual
average rate of 8 percent during this period. However, it
was outpaced by real GDP which grew at around 10 percent
each year.

income relative to GDP, and in recent years that of the
government transfers have been the main causes behind the decline in the disposable income ratio. While the average
wage rate has risen at a rapid pace, it has lagged productivity growth. Much of the decline in investment income has
resulted from continued low saving deposit interest rates, weak equity prices, and a lack of investment alternatives.
At the same time, households save close to 30 percent of their disposable income, a much higher ratio than might
be expected given China’s income level and its demographic structure. A large part of this reflects strong
precautionary savings given the significant uncertainties surrounding public pensions and rising health care and
education costs. The underdeveloped financial market has also played a role, as it offers few consumer credit facilities
and insurance instruments, and thus limited scope for households to borrow against their future income or pool risks.2

less, with the spending on social areas, such as health and
education, falling behind that in most other countries as a share of GDP. As a result, the share of publicly provided
household consumption has also declined.

B. Recent Developments
4.
Output growth continues to be strong. Based on the revised official data, GDP
growth in 2005 reached nearly 10 percent, roughly the same as in the previous year
(Table 1 and Box 2). Indicators for the major components of demand suggest that output
growth in 2005 could have been much higher than officially estimated. Consumption growth
has remained high, and investment growth showed signs of increasing beginning in the
second half of the year. The contribution of net exports to growth also increased significantly
during 2005.
5.
Economic activity maintained
its momentum in 2006, with further
evidence of acceleration in
investment. GDP grew by 10¼ percent
(year-on-year) in the first quarter. Total
nominal fixed investment increased
from 25.7 percent in 2005 to 29.8
percent in the first half of 2006. Net
exports continued to be strong,
although the pace of import growth has
accelerated. Indicators also suggest that
consumption growth remained high.

contributing to oversupply in some products, as well as declining unit costs owing to
continuing strong increases in productivity. This has been more than offset by price increases
in services—including health care, education, and household maintenance—and rising fuel
costs. Producer price inflation continues to fall from its peak of 8½ percent in late 2004 to
about 2½ percent in May 2006, reflecting some easing in materials prices, especially as new
production capacity in steel, chemicals, and coal has come on stream.

7
Box 2. Recent Revisions in China’s Official GDP Figures
Based on a comprehensive economic census of businesses, China increased the estimate of
GDP in 2004 by 17 percent. Based on the 2004 data, a standard statistical technique (the
trend-deviation method) was then used to estimate revised data back to 1993. Real GDP
growth was raised by an annual average of about ½ percentage point (see figure below) and the
1993–2004 average for GDP growth increased to 9½ percent.
The bulk of the upward revision came in the service sector, which increased by almost
50 percent. As a result, the share of the service sector in 2004 GDP increased by 9 percentage
points to 41 percent. Manufacturing’s share of output was revised up by only 4 percent as a
result of the census.
The revised data show higher GDP implicit price inflation, especially in recent years. In
particular, estimated inflation in the service sector increased substantially, with the
2000-04 average annual implicit inflation for this sector nearly doubling from
1¾ to 3½ percent in the revised data.

With regards to expenditure side estimates of GDP, only 2004 data have been revised
and published so far, and the 2005 preliminary data using the new methodology have
recently been published. The largest revisions were to government consumption and
inventories. As a result, the GDP shares of household consumption and gross fixed capital
formation both fell slightly, with each accounting for about 40 percent of GDP.

account surplus in 2005 to over 7 percent of

2004

GDP, up from 3½ percent in 2004. This
slowdown largely reflected a switch away from imports toward domestically produced
inputs, a moderation in investment demand for machinery, and some reduction in raw
material inventories. Export growth was robust given strong world demand and China’s
increasing role in the processing trade. The expectation of the renminbi appreciation may
have played a role in the rise of the trade surplus, although the impact is unlikely to have
been very large.1

8.
The trade surplus continued to rise in 2006, with the $61 billion surplus in the first
six months of 2006 up 50 percent from the same period last year. Import growth has picked
up somewhat, driven mostly by primary products and machinery, while export growth
remains strong. Last year’s agreements to limit exports to the United States and the EU of
textiles and apparel, which are a small share of China’s total exports, appear to have had a
very limited impact on China’s export growth thus far.2
9.
Foreign official reserves accumulation has continued at a rapid pace. Reserves
increased by $208 billion in 2005, broadly in line with reserve accumulation in 2004, and by
a further $106 billion in the first five months of 2006, bringing the level at end-May to about
$925 billion (Table 4).3 Reserve accumulation in the second-half of 2005 was increasingly
driven by trade flows, in contrast to the situation in 2004 and the first half of 2005 when
speculative inflows played a larger role. Net FDI inflows, at $68 billion in 2005, increased
compared to 2004 despite a jump to $10 billion in China’s foreign investment abroad. Over
the period, non-FDI capital flows sharply reversed to an outflow of $22 billion in 2005
(including errors and omissions), compared to an inflow of $85 billion in 2004. The renminbi
has fluctuated significantly in both real and nominal effective terms reflecting the volatility
of the U.S. dollar against other currencies, and in May 2006, it was about 15 percent below
its previous peak in February 2002.

The Selected Issues paper discusses the factors underlying the increase in the current account surplus in 2005.

Textiles account for about 14 percent of Chinese exports. In addition to an earlier agreement with the EU,
China and the United States reached an agreement limiting exports of certain textiles and apparel items
beginning in 2006, setting volume growth limits in a range of 10-17 percent annually through 2008.
3

Adjusting for capital injections to banks from official reserves and foreign exchange swaps of the central bank,
reserves rose by $236 billion in 2005, compared to a $206 billion rise in 2004.

The equity market has been buoyant in 2006, while the rapid growth in property
prices has eased. Progress in equity market reforms, especially in reducing the overhang of
non-tradable shares, has helped boost the market—as of mid-June the index for the Shanghai
Stock Exchange had increased 35 percent over its end-2005 level. Nevertheless, the market is
still 25 percent below its end-2000 level. Property price growth peaked at over 10 percent in
the fourth quarter of 2004, and by end-2005 growth had slowed to 6½ percent, partly
reflecting the government’s control measures. Prices in Shanghai, particularly in certain
sections of the city, declined sharply. However, concerns of a rebound in property prices in
other urban areas have recently surfaced, with the authorities launching new policies to
regulate the property sector, including measures to limit luxury housing developments.
11.
Less than full sterilization of foreign exchange reserve accumulation has left
substantial liquidity in the banking system, and credit growth appears to be
accelerating. While broad money (M2) growth has increased since mid-2005, reaching a
17½ percent annual rate by the end of the year, credit growth, averaging around 13½ percent
in 2005, remained relatively subdued, reflecting more cautious lending by the large stateowned commercial banks undergoing restructuring and moral suasion on the part of the PBC
(Table 5). Broad money growth continued to rise in the first part of 2006, and lending growth
picked up as well. By May, M2 and lending were growing at rates of 19 and 15 percent
respectively. In response, the PBC increased the benchmark lending rate in April by a modest
27 basis points, and administrative controls and lending guidance were increased.

11
Reserve requirements were raised by
½ percentage point in June and further
administrative measures and lending
guidance were initiated. The PBC also
introduced a new series of central bank
bills that are being sold on a mandatory
purchase basis at below market interest
rates to banks with fast lending growth.
Short-term interest rates have risen
somewhat since early November as the
PBC stepped up open-market operations,
but they still remain below the
2½-3 percent levels of 2004.

increase spending on social programs
and clear pending liabilities, including repaying all remaining arrears on VAT refunds. As in
2004, local governments recorded a large surplus (about ½ percent of GDP), in part
reflecting late transfers from the central government. The 2005 outturn continues the trend of
fiscal consolidation over the last few years. If the timing of the build-up and repayment of
VAT refund-related arrears is accounted for, the pace of consolidation would be much faster
than what the cash-based data show, with the 2005 outturn being near balance.4 The budget
outturn through April 2006 shows that revenue performance continues to be very strong,
exceeding the growth rate projected in the 2006 budget.

4

Clearing of arrears—typically a below-the-line item—is treated as above-the-line expenditure in China’s
official fiscal accounts.

12
C. Macroeconomic Outlook and Risks
13.
Staff projects GDP growth to remain around 10 percent in 2006. This forecast
assumes that appropriate macroeconomic policies will be in place to constrain investment
growth. However, recent data for investment and exports point to the increasing possibility
that GDP growth could exceed 10 percent. Even if policy actions are taken now to constrain
investment, the main impact of tightening measures on growth are likely to be experienced in
2007. The outturn in the first five months of 2006 also suggests that export growth may not
slow as much as generally expected, which not only would boost GDP growth, but would
result in a further widening of the external current account surplus.
14.
Inflation is expected to remain below 2 percent in 2006. Although consumption
growth has remained strong, much of the economy’s rapid growth rate has been driven by
investment. This has continually added to the economy’s productive capacity and in some
sectors, such as automobiles and steel, it has led to overcapacity. At the same time, the
substantial liquidity in the banking system and the associated acceleration in credit growth
have been largely confined to financing investment and not consumption. Moreover,
although wage rates have risen in recent years, with substantial underutilized labor resources
in the economy, the wage increases have been relatively modest. Indeed, wage and
disposable income as a share of GDP remain significantly below even their early 2000 levels
(Box 1). As a result, despite the rapid overall growth, inflation has been subdued and is likely
to remain so in the near term. Falling prices in sectors with overcapacity offset the likely rise
in services inflation and upward adjustments in certain administered prices.5 As nontradables
make up much of the households consumption basket, an appreciation of the currency is
unlikely to have a significant direct downward impact and with overcapacity confined to
certain sectors at present, the risk of generalized deflation appears small. The risk of a sharp
rise in inflationary pressures is also limited, given that consumer credit facilities remain
limited.
15.
A significant risk remains that macroeconomic policies will not be sufficiently
tight to contain investment growth. In particular, there appears to be a need for monetary
policy to be tightened further to prevent a surge in credit growth from tipping off a boombust cycle and an associated rise in banks’ nonperforming loans. There is also a risk that, as
in the past, it may be difficult to slow investment growth in the run-up to the scheduled
change in government in early 2008 (when positions in all levels of government are
shuffled). Among other major risks to the outlook, a further sharp increase in oil prices
would adversely affect growth both directly and indirectly if this leads to a more pronounced
slowdown in global demand.6 Growing protectionist sentiments in China’s major markets
5

Prices of utilities and other public services are slated to rise this year, and some modest increases in petroleum
product prices are expected to bring them closer in line with world oil prices.
6

The direct impact of high world oil prices has been limited so far, as the government has not implemented a
full pass-through to domestic prices, although in recent months the authorities have taken steps to increase the
retail prices of oil products. As a result, gasoline and diesel prices in May 2006 remained about 15 percent and
40 percent below comparable U.S. prices. Despite the restricted pass-through at the retail level, China’s oil
companies with integrated downstream and upstream operations have generally continued to post significant
profits.

13
also present a major risk. Moreover, a disorderly unwinding of global imbalances would
threaten China’s growth, as economic activity in partner countries would likely suffer
lingering adverse effects. Although less immediate, avian flu remains a threat.
16.
China’s medium-term prospects are favorable, but the savings-investment gap
would remain large unless further structural reforms and policy changes are
implemented to rebalance growth. The illustrative scenario presented in Table 8 suggests
that GDP growth could average around 9¼ percent annually, but the saving-investment gap
would remain high at around 6 percent of GDP. To reduce this gap, reforms and policies are
needed to rebalance growth away from heavy reliance on investment and exports toward
domestic consumption by improving intermediation of savings through further banking
sector reform and capital market development, and continuing reforms in the state-owned
enterprises and the labor market to maintain strong productivity growth. In addition, reforms
to China’s pension, education, and health care systems, along with a shift in public
expenditures toward these areas, are important in helping to increase private consumption by
reducing the need for large precautionary savings. These reforms and policy changes would
reduce the saving-investment gap over time, but it would also critically depend on how the
real exchange rate might change in the coming years. 7
17.
In the absence of such a rebalancing, medium-term prospects are subject to
significant risks. Growth could be threatened if China were to continue to rely heavily on
inefficient investment as a primary source, especially if such investment leads to
overcapacity and falling prices and profitability, burdening banks with additional NPLs in the
coming years. If reform of the domestic financial sector is not advanced substantially,
vulnerabilities will continue to increase as China further integrates into the global economy,
and capital account liberalization would expose the economy to potentially large swings in
the direction of capital flows, as household and corporations diversify their portfolios. If
changes in the real exchange rate occur through nominal exchange rate adjustment, inflation
would remain modest. If the nominal exchange rate remains largely unchanged, then at some
point in time, real exchange rate adjustment will have to take place through higher inflation.
The adverse effects of this outcome would disproportionately be experienced by the poor,
especially in rural areas. A rise in social stresses within China (if, for example, income gaps
between the rural and urban areas increase substantially) could also present a significant risk
over the medium term.

7

Following convention, the exchange rate on a real effective basis is assumed to remain unchanged in the
illustrative scenario presented here. The impact of a real exchange change was discussed in Chapter II of last
year’s Selected Issues paper.

14
II. POLICY DISCUSSIONS
18.
The authorities broadly agreed with the general economic outlook presented by
the staff. They argued that GDP growth is unlikely to slow in 2006, and that inflation should
remain subdued but the risk of deflation should be low. There was general agreement among
the authorities that excess liquidity in the banking system and strong local government
incentives to invest could add to the rebound in investment and bank lending growth already
underway. On the external front, the authorities argued that structural factors would likely
keep the current account from narrowing rapidly, emphasizing the need for policies to
rebalance the economy away from export-led growth toward consumption. Against this
background, the discussions focused on near-term macroeconomic challenges and the
exchange rate, as well as policy actions needed over the medium term to make growth more
sustainable by rebalancing its composition.
A. Monetary Policy
19.
The staff stressed the urgency of monetary policy actions to prevent a further
acceleration in investment growth. The staff argued that a serious situation is looming,
with substantial and growing liquidity in the banking system, continuing local government
pressure on banks to expand their lending, and restraint on credit growth by the large banks
diminishing as they complete their recapitalizations. In addition, financial innovations, such
as the introduction of short-term corporate bills and discount bills, have lowered borrowing
costs. Without a significant further tightening of monetary policy, a continued rise in credit
growth would fuel a further increase in investment growth that would likely be followed by
price declines in overcapacity sectors and an associated rise in banks’ nonperforming loans.
20.
The authorities recognized the need to contain investment and credit growth, but
there were some differences regarding the urgency of action and what measures should
be used. The authorities noted that they had intensified open market operations (OMOs)
during 2006. While they agreed that market-based monetary policy instruments needed to be
used, the authorities maintained that administrative measures would still be needed, as these
were better suited to restrain growth in specific sectors where overinvestment was a
particular concern. Steps taken by the authorities subsequent to the discussions reflect this
view, with a combination of administered measures and monetary policy actions having been
put in place. The staff continues to believe that more steps will need to be taken and that
greater reliance should be placed on OMOs, perhaps supplemented by further increases in
benchmark interest rates and/or reserve requirements.
21.
More broadly, the staff urged the authorities to take steps to improve the
effectiveness of indirect monetary policy instruments to manage the economy better. In
recent years, China’s monetary policy has sought to balance low inflation with continued
strong growth, using monetary aggregates as intermediate targets. These aims and the PBC’s
basic policy framework remain appropriate at this stage of China’s economic and financial
market development. However, the burden of having to tightly manage the exchange rate in
the face of foreign exchange inflows has created a major conflict in monetary policy
implementation. To circumvent this conflict, the authorities have relied on moral suasion and
administrative controls to restrain credit and investment growth and keep inflation low.

15
While some use of administrative measures may be warranted at this juncture, the staff
argued that over time the effectiveness of administrative controls will diminish as the
sophistication of the economy increases. At the same time, the potential costs of the
distortions that these controls create could grow larger. Trying to influence bank lending
decisions also directly contradicts the government’s goal of creating a banking sector
operating on a sound commercial basis. Thus, the staff emphasized that allowing the
exchange rate to move more flexibly and be increasingly determined by market conditions
would help to improve the authorities’ control over monetary policy, and the current
exchange rate arrangement provides sufficient room to do this without exacerbating capital
inflows. The lack of discretion given to the PBC to set interest rates is also an impediment to
timely policy action.
22.
The staff noted that over time, it will be important for the PBC to formalize its
policy framework, establishing an appropriate nominal anchor for monetary policy, and
more clearly articulating its policy objectives. This would help to underpin market
expectations about inflation, interest rates, and the exchange rate. In this regard, the now
regular publication of the Monetary Policy Report by the PBC provides a convenient vehicle
to increase the transparency of monetary policy formulation.
B. Exchange Rate Regime
23.
Since July 2005, the authorities have undertaken several reforms to improve the
functioning of the exchange market, but the rate remains tightly managed. These
reforms represent significant steps and can potentially allow market forces to play a
substantial role in determining the exchange rate (Box 3), while allowing banks and
enterprises to hedge against greater variability in the rate. These steps have significantly
improved the functioning of the spot and forward exchange markets, although these markets
remain shallow given the limited variability in the rate. The PBC continues to dominate the
foreign exchange spot market—the lack of any discernible appreciation in the renminbi-U.S.
dollar rate in recent months, particularly when the dollar had been depreciating against other
currencies, and the continued heavy accumulation of reserves serve to confirm this view. The
average intra-day fluctuation in the renminbi-dollar rate has remained below the 0.3 percent
limit, although it has increased in recent months. Moreover, after the initial 2.1 percent
revaluation in July, the renminbi-dollar rate has appreciated by only about 1½ percent.

Box 3. Recent Measures to Liberalize the Foreign Exchange Market
Previously, spot trading of foreign currency occurred through the official foreign exchange market,
the China Foreign Exchange Trading System (CFETS). In practice, banks settled currency trades
internally throughout the day, limiting their sale of excess foreign exchange in the CFETS to once or twice
a day to minimize transactions costs given the limited volatility in the exchange rate. Thus, the volume of
transactions in the foreign exchange market was relatively small.
Following the July 2005 reform to the exchange rate regime, a number of steps have been taken to
deepen the foreign exchange market and allow market forces to potentially have a greater influence
on the exchange rate.
•

The number of participants in the interbank market (both domestic and foreign) has been increased.

•

Since January 2006, a market maker system in the spot trading of foreign exchange has been in
operation. Fifteen banks have been appointed as market makers in the spot market, and they are
allowed to trade among themselves in over-the-counter (OTC) trading off the floor of the centralized
interbank market (CFETS). The new system allows the market makers to trade with each other
directly without paying the high transactions fees charged in the CFETS, which in turn generates more
frequent intraday trading.

•

The rule for setting the CFETS central parity for the exchange rate has also been changed. Under the
new rule, the central parity rate of the renminbi against the dollar (the benchmark rate) is set each
morning (at 9:15 a.m., before CFETS trading begins at 9:30 a.m.) based on a weighted average of the
prices the market makers intend to offer. This is in contrast to the previous arrangement where the
central parity rate was the closing price of the previous trading day on the CFETS floor. Thus,
depending on the prices quoted by the market makers, the central parity rate can change by any
amount at the start of a trading day, but intraday movements remain constrained by the ±0.3 percent
band.

•

The market infrastructure has been improved, including by allowing the trading of forward contracts
and swaps.

•

In April-May 2006, the government also eased restrictions on payments for foreign services by
individuals, outward investment by institutional investors and direct investment abroad by Chinese
firms.

While these recent reforms are important for the development of the exchange market, they have
not had a significant impact on exchange rate movements.
•

The volume of transactions since February 2006 in OTC trading has increased significantly to over
90 percent of total trading volumes, an inter-day volatility in the RMB/US$ rate has risen since
March.

•

The reforms have reduced PBC’s status of being an active participant in the market to that of an active
client of the market makers. However, given that the PBC is still the largest client by far, it continues
to retain considerable influence over the exchange rate.

•

The benefit of these reforms so far has been increased involvement by banks in trading and
monitoring of exchange rate movements. Over time, this will prepare banks to manage their foreign
exchange flows and risks, helping them to adapt to an environment where the PBC allows more
exchange rate volatility.

17
24.
On a real effective exchange rate basis, the renminbi by May 2006 has returned
to roughly its June 2005 level despite the revaluation and change in the exchange rate
arrangement. In fact, movement in the renminbi’s real value over a considerable period of
time has not been in line with most fundamental factors that are generally considered to be
important in determining the exchange rate’s real value. In particular, since the previous peak
in the renminbi’s real effective value in early 2002, the currency has depreciated, while such
factors as a substantial net foreign asset accumulation and a sharp rise in China’s productivity
relative to partner countries over the period since 2001 would be expected to have
contributed to a real appreciation of the currency.8 The current account surplus also has risen
from 1.3 percent of GDP in 2001 to 7.2 percent in 2005, with the surplus doubling as a ratio
to GDP in 2005 alone. With investment as a ratio to GDP continuing to rise during this
period, the surge in the current account surplus represents a widening of China’s savingsinvestment balance that is explained by an increase in government savings associated with
fiscal consolidation and a substantial rise in corporate savings that is increasingly difficult to
explain in terms of fundamental determinants of savings behavior. It is especially difficult to
pinpoint a change in such fundamental determinants that would explain the doubling of the
surplus in relation to GDP in 2005 and that would suggest that the surplus at its present level
could be considered to be a new “normal” level of the savings-investment balance for China.
In addition, gross official reserves have risen from $219 billion in 2001 to $930 billion at
end-May 2006, with more than $200 billion of reserves accumulated in each of the past two
years and another $100 billion in the first five months of 2006. Some of the reserve build-up
in 2004 was related to non-FDI capital inflows that may have reflected speculation of
renminbi revaluation, but since the first half of 2005, these inflows have diminished
substantially. All of these developments point to the currency as being undervalued and that
this undervaluation has increased further since last year’s Article IV consultation.
25.
The authorities stressed their commitment to the managed floating regime and
argued that exchange rate movements since July 2005 were consistent with the new
exchange rate arrangement. They noted that under this arrangement the exchange rate was
determined by the supply and demand conditions in the foreign exchange with reference to a
basket of currencies (with undisclosed weights). The rate was not intended to be directly
pegged to the basket, and short-term deviations from the reference basket were to be
expected. The appreciation of the dollar against other major currencies in the period after the
July change had led to a deviation from strict adherence to the basket and accounted for the
stability in the bilateral exchange rate through March. The authorities suggested that more
recently, supply and demand conditions in the foreign exchange market were one factor
accounting for the stability of the rate despite the sharp depreciation in the U.S. dollar, with
the easing of capital controls in April possibly increasing the demand for dollars.9

8
9

From February 2002 to May 2006, the real effective value of the currency has declined by 15 percent.

In mid-April, the government announced limited measures that would ease restrictions on holding foreign
exchange bank accounts, simplify approval of service payments in foreign currencies, and allow institutional
investors to invest overseas. Regulations formulated to implement these changes suggest that the increase in
capital outflows will continue to be tightly controlled, and their effect on capital outflows is likely to be limited.

18
26.
The authorities noted the substantial problems in making an assessment of the
level of the exchange rate, particularly in China’s case where there were large
uncertainties over the underlying savings-investment balance, the implicit debt the economy
faced in reforming the banking sector and social services, and possible speculative current
and capital account inflows because of expectations of a renminbi revaluation. In addition,
they argued that China’s large current account surplus was less a result of an undervalued
currency, but more a result of China’s increased openness and the increasing shift of
processing trade operations to China by multinational companies taking advantage of
favorable labor market conditions. Restrictions on imports of high-technology products were
another factor contributing to this surplus. The staff agreed that increased global integration
has contributed to a growing current account surplus, but argued that this was not
inconsistent with an assessment pointing to further undervaluation of the exchange rate.
27.
The authorities agreed that greater flexibility was needed over the medium term,
but stressed that exchange rate reform would have to proceed in a gradual and
controllable manner. They argued that even a significant appreciation of the exchange rate
was unlikely to have a large impact on the trade balance, especially since the effects of such a
change would be largely felt by exporters of low value-added goods. Their concerns continue
to center around potential adverse impact of an exchange rate appreciation on
macroeconomic and financial sector stability. In particular, such an appreciation could have a
significant adverse impact on employment because low-value added goods tended to be
labor-intensive. Given that almost half of rural income was derived from migrant wages,
including in such industries, an appreciation could have a substantial negative impact on rural
income. The authorities also had doubts as to whether the banking system was sufficiently
sound at present to be able to manage a significant exchange rate appreciation. The staff
argued that the overall impact on the economy of a moderate, but significant, appreciation
would be manageable, and any adverse effects on rural incomes could be mitigated through
budgetary measures, such as transitional income support for affected households and
advancing the implementation of plans to increase support for health care and education in
rural areas. In the financial sector, the impact of such an exchange rate change would be
small, given the limited foreign exchange exposure of the banking system and its clients and
the availability of instruments to hedge foreign exchange risk. However, the authorities were
not persuaded that the disruptive effects of a significant appreciation would be manageable,
and thus they saw a need to proceed with caution.
28.
The staff stressed the need to utilize more fully the flexibility provided by the
current exchange rate system to allow greater movement in the renminbi-dollar rate
and a further significant appreciation of the currency in nominal effective terms. The
staff argued that China’s current exchange rate arrangement provides sufficient flexibility to
allow for such an appreciation, which is in China's best interest. The timing is right given the
strength of the Chinese economy. Increased flexibility would provide much needed space to
exercise greater monetary policy control. With limited nominal exchange rate flexibility, the
expansionary impulse of reserve accumulation on domestic monetary conditions is being
contained to a substantial extent by financial repression. This works at cross purposes with
the banking sector reforms since it directly conflicts with the government’s aim to create a
banking sector operating on a sound commercial basis. From a near-term perspective, greater
flexibility would create more room to enable the central bank to use open market operations

19
to help tighten liquidity conditions without triggering a renewal of speculative inflows. That
said, the staff emphasized that exchange rate flexibility, not just appreciation, is what is
needed for China’s economy going forward. The authorities acknowledged that limited
flexibility of the exchange rate creates a conflict in monetary policy, but they were confident
that they could manage the situation. The staff said that it could not be done without creating
distortions through further repression of the banking system, and noted that it would be better
to eliminate the source of the conflict by allowing more flexibility in the exchange rate.
29.
Greater flexibility of the exchange rate of the currency will also contribute to the
sustainability of China’s growth by helping to the rebalance the economy over the
medium term. It will aid in improving the allocation of investment and its efficiency by
giving the right price signals to investors. By increasing households’ purchasing power, it
will boost consumption. In addition, it may help avert the build-up of short-term foreign
currency liabilities that would occur if the exchange rate remains undervalued and financial
repression continues, thereby reducing the risk of what could be a significant source of
vulnerability.
30.
Some have raised concerns that a renminbi appreciation could push the
economy into deflation and the kind of prolonged recession experienced by Japan in the
1990s. These concerns have been echoed by some Chinese officials. The staff believes that
this view is based on a misreading of Japan's experience. Japan's “lost decade” can be mostly
traced to an asset price bubble that was the result of an overly loose monetary stance and lax
financial supervision and regulation, along with resistance to a real appreciation of the
country's currency. The collapse of this bubble caused severe financial and corporate sector
strains. The key lesson for China from this experience is that an early move to greater
exchange rate flexibility would be desirable. While an appreciation could potentially exert
deflationary pressures in the near term, this is less of a concern in the current environment
where low inflation is the result of declining prices in certain sectors where previous high
levels of investment have led to excess capacity. In addition, the authorities could use the low
inflation environment to raise certain administered prices such as those of utilities, where
increases are overdue and much needed to improve resource allocation and efficiency in the
economy.
31.
From a global perspective, exchange rate flexibility would not only serve China’s
best interest, but would also help contribute to an orderly process for resolving global
current account imbalances. The authorities argued that dealing with global imbalances
requires a concerted effort on the part of all countries to take policy actions, including
meaningful fiscal consolidation in the United States, structural reforms in Japan and Europe,
and greater investment in the oil-exporting countries. The staff noted that China can play an
important role in reducing imbalances through policy actions that are in its own interest,
including greater flexibility of the exchange rate, which would permit a significant
appreciation, coupled with China’s structural reforms aimed at rebalancing economic growth.
The authorities responded that the imbalance of China’s current account could not be solved
solely and fully by changes in the exchange rate, and that the most effective way to deal with
the external surplus was through policies and structural reforms that would rebalance China’s
economy toward self-sustaining domestic demand, while cautioning that this would take
time. They stated that the problem of global imbalances was caused in large part by the
United States and should be dealt with primarily by the United States taking appropriate

20
policy actions. The staff acknowledged that on its own the direct contribution of an
appreciation in China’s exchange rate to reducing global imbalances might not be large, but
such a change in combination with other measures to rebalance China’s growth and
necessary policy actions in other major economies would make a major difference. This is
why the Fund was calling for decisive policy actions by all major countries to help deal with
the problem.
C. Fiscal Policy
32.
The 2006 budget is appropriate from a near-term perspective. The budgeted
deficit is largely unchanged from its targeted level in the 2005 budget, implying a deficit of
roughly 1½ of GDP (official definition) in 2006. Revenue is conservatively projected to
increase by 12 percent, and expenditure is budgeted to rise by 14 percent. Revenues are once
again likely to exceed budget estimates, and the authorities indicated that revenue
overperformance would be used for additional transfers to poorer regions, social sector
spending, and support for farmers. In the absence of concrete plans and adequate controls to
monitor higher spending, the staff encouraged the authorities not to embark on ad hoc
spending measures to increase consumption in the near term. Rather, the staff emphasized
building on some of the pilot projects currently being implemented by selected local
governments to broaden and reform the provision of social services, such as health care,
education, and pensions.10 The authorities agreed that overly ambitious spending now that
exceeds implementation capacity would be wasteful, and that efforts should be focused on
developing and implementing comprehensive plans to improve the provision of social
services. As formulation of spending plans and implementation capacity improve, the staff
believes that expenditure in these areas can be ramped up over the medium term. As a
consequence, the budget deficit could rise over time, but fiscal consolidation over the past
few years would allow this without jeopardizing longer-term fiscal sustainability.
33.
Improving the quality and scope of the provision of health care and education is
critical to reducing households’ precautionary savings. China’s government sector spends
much less on health and education than comparator countries, and further increases in
spending in these areas are needed. Public spending on education, although growing, remains
relatively low, and is a major obstacle to improving compulsory education. Public spending
on health care as a share of total health care spending has declined over the last decade, with
the result that the share of out-of-pocket spending by households in total health care spending
reached almost 60 percent by end-2003, from 20 percent in 1978. The government has
recently launched new programs to strengthen education services and health insurance in
rural areas. These programs are being implemented by a number of local governments, and
are slated to be scaled up nationwide over the next few years. In the area of education, tuition
and fees are being eliminated for compulsory education in rural areas. As part of efforts to
raise spending, it will also be important to address capacity constraints, especially the
availability of trained personnel.

Developments in social spending are discussed in the Selected Issues paper.

34.
Pension reform also can contribute to boosting consumption by reducing
savings. Currently, China’s pension system covers only about a quarter of the workforce.
The provision of the bulk of these pensions is assigned to lower levels of government. The
resulting decentralized and fragmented nature of the pension system does not ensure
adequate coverage, is inefficient, does not appropriately pool risks, impedes labor mobility,
and has strained local government finances. Moreover, parameter changes are required to
ensure the sustainability of the current pension system, including raising the retirement age
and changing benefit payments. Some pilot pension reform programs are underway, but they
do not fully address all of the shortcomings in the current system.
35.
The authorities and the staff agreed that ensuring the effectiveness of increased
spending on social services required further essential measures to strengthen fiscal
management, including through better formulation and execution of the budget. The
authorities reiterated their commitment to continuing the reform of the budget process,
including by putting in place as scheduled the revised budget classification and chart of
accounts, and fully implementing the treasury single account. The new budget classification
and chart of accounts are to be in place by next year, and the 2007 budget will be prepared in
line with them.
36.
The authorities and the staff also agreed that center-local fiscal relations were in
need of significant reform and would play an important role in rebalancing the
economy and spreading the benefits of growth. Income disparities across regions continue
to widen, with some localities facing difficulties in funding expenditure mandates especially
in health and education. The staff encouraged the authorities in their efforts to address
structural imbalances in subnational finances, including by developing a comprehensive
strategy that reassesses tax assignments across levels of government, rebalances expenditure
responsibilities in line with resources, and reforms the transfer system toward a more rulebased system that ensures all local governments have resources adequate to meet their
spending responsibilities.
III. STRUCTURAL REFORMS TO REBALANCE GROWTH
A. Banking and Capital Market Reforms
37.
Improving the intermediation of China’s large domestic savings through
financial sector reforms will make an important contribution to rebalancing the
economy. As banks increasingly operate on a commercial basis and the capital market
develops further, the allocative efficiency of investment is likely to improve, while a wider
range of household credit instruments would enable households to borrow against future
income and raise returns on financial assets, which should boost consumption and bring
down the saving rate.
38.
The authorities have placed banking reform at the center of the effort to
improve intermediation of China’s large private savings. By mid-2005, the authorities
completed financial restructuring of three of the four major commercial banks, including
China Construction Bank (CCB), Bank of China (BOC), and the Industrial and Commercial
Bank of China (ICBC), through capital injections and sales of non-performing loans. By end2005, all three banks announced the selection of major foreign financial institutions as

22
strategic investors with minority ownership stakes, and CCB and BOC have completed IPOs
(Table 9). The system-wide ratio of NPLs to total loans declined to 8½ percent at end-2005
(from 13 percent at end-2004), with the three restructured banks having an average NPL ratio
of 4½ percent. Banks accounting for 75 percent of total banking assets were compliant with
the 8 percent capital adequacy requirement with full provisioning at end-2005.
39.
Nevertheless, the authorities and the staff agreed that further fundamental
improvements are required in the banks’ commercial orientation, risk management,
internal controls, and governance. Strict adherence to the timetables for implementing the
business restructuring plans of the three major banks that have been recapitalized is essential.
Banks will have to learn to price risk appropriately to make full use of the latitude provided
by the 2004 liberalization of lending rates. Continued strengthening of banking supervision,
in particular focusing on the enforcement of existing regulations, will aid the bank reform
process. Diversified bank ownership may also speed up the process, particularly if foreign
financial institutions, which have taken minority ownership stakes in the banks, transfer
much needed technical expertise and demand better governance. The staff emphasized the
importance of banks’ meeting the capital adequacy rules that come into effect in 2007. In
addition, the staff suggested that government involvement in the management and business
operations of the banks should continue to be cut and eliminated over time. The authorities’
decision after the discussions to force banks with high levels of lending growth to purchase
special issues of central bank bills at below market interest rates illustrates one aspect of
government interference in the banks’ decisions that works counter to the basic intention of
bank reform. Such financial repression is a direct consequence of the authorities trying to
simultaneously achieve the conflicting goals of tightly managing the exchange rate and
controlling monetary conditions.
40.
The staff stressed that particular attention should be given to activities of the
Agricultural Bank of China (ABC). The ABC has been slow in restructuring its operations
and lacks a concrete reform plan. In addition to the efficiency losses in the bank itself, further
delay in reforming ABC risks creating serious moral hazard that could undermine the
reforms of other banks. The staff urged the authorities to move quickly to adopt an ambitious
reform plan, including a time-bound restructuring and recapitalization plan with appropriate
performance parameters. The authorities agreed with the staff on the need to restructure the
ABC, but noted that it presented a significant challenge given the scale of the bank’s
operations and the important role the bank plays in the agricultural sector. A restructuring of
the bank is currently under consideration in the context of an economy-wide reform of rural
financing, but this could take time to resolve. The staff advised that if that were the case, then
interim restraints should be placed on the ABC’s lending activities.
41.
Progress in reforming the rural credit cooperatives by improving their
operations and strengthening balance sheets through capital injections continues, and
the authorities are on track to complete this reform by end-2007. The staff welcomed this
initiative as potentially playing a significant role in helping to develop the rural sector. As in
the case of the major state-owned commercial banks, establishing and supervising carefully
the implementation of time-bound plans for improving the commercial orientation, risk
management, internal controls, and governance arrangements for these institutions is
essential for this reform to be successful.

23
42.
The staff welcomed the progress being made in improving bank supervision,
although some key shortcomings remain. The China Bank Regulatory Commission
(CBRC) continues to strengthen on-site examinations and monitoring of large exposures and
connected lending. The staff reiterated the importance that the CBRC ensure all banks are
taking the necessary steps to comply with capital adequacy requirements with and full loanloss provisioning by 2007, as required by existing guidelines, and enforce appropriate
penalties for those banks which fall short. The staff also encouraged the CBRC to strengthen
bank supervision further, in particular with regard to assessing banks’ foreign exchange and
credit risks, and emphasized that closer monitoring of the flow of new non-performing loans
is critical to early detection of potential problems.
43.
The staff discussed steps needed to accelerate the development of China’s capital
markets which would also help to make investment more efficient and raise
consumption over time (Box 4). The limited role of capital markets in China at present
reflects the dominance of the state banks in intermediation, but these markets are also
plagued with regulatory and governance problems. Developing bond and equity markets is
important for improving intermediation and increasing incentives for banks to seek out smalland medium-size enterprises. These reforms will help in increasing consumption by
encouraging greater direct and indirect household participation in the equity and bond
markets, which would allow households to diversify their portfolios and raise returns on
them. As a result, consumption decisions would not be narrowly based on wage
developments, but on more diversified sources of income. Expanding the bond market also
would help in lowering corporate savings by reducing the need for enterprises to rely on
internal savings to fund investment.
44.
The authorities have made progress in reviving the equity markets. A critical step
in this direction has been the reforms to convert the nontraded shares of state-owned
companies listed on the stock market to tradable shares, which is expected to be largely
completed by end-year. As a result, stock prices have significantly rebounded and interest in
new IPOs and secondary placement offers has soared. Nevertheless, more needs to be done to
ease access to the market and allow stocks to be publicly issued based on firms’ disclosure of
financial data and prospects.
45.
Progress also has been made in developing money and corporate bond markets,
although much more needs to done in the latter area. To boost development of the money
market, a corporate bill market was established in 2005 which has grown rapidly. An
interbank market for asset-backed securities was also established in November 2005. In the
corporate bond market, the new Securities Act has removed some of the legal impediments
that has kept the market from expanding. However, the current “merit” based bond issuance
system, requiring government selection of each bond issue, has not been replaced by a
disclosure-based system and the cap on corporate bond interest rates has not been
eliminated.11 In the staff's view, these are likely to continue to hold back the corporate

11

Several government agencies currently play regulatory roles in the bond market, often with some overlap of
responsibilities. As a result, the bond market is over-regulated, with state control inhibiting development. These
and other impediments are discussed in Chapter VI of the 2005 Selected Issues paper.

and enterprise bonds increased significantly in 2005.
The PBC also announced the establishment of an interbank market for asset backed securities with maturities of
1 to 10 years. This market is yet to take off, with only three such bonds sold so far.

reflecting uncertainty over how the government might

listed companies. This reform program has moved
rapidly—out of some 1,350 listed companies, nearly
900 companies, which account for 70 percent of the
stock market capitalization, had completed the reform
program by April 2006. As part of this reform,
existing shareholders agreed to these conversions in exchange for receiving additional shares in these
companies, with this compensation being negotiated on a company-by-company basis. Reflecting these efforts,
the Shanghai and Shenzhen composite indices rose by 44 percent and 25 percent respectively between JanuaryJune 2006. In May 2006, the one-year moratorium on initial public offerings was lifted, which could also further
boost China’s equity markets. The newly revised Securities Law has also streamlined and reduced the financial
requirements for listing on the stock exchange (making it easier for firms with less capital to list) while
strengthening the disclosure requirements for firms. In September 2005, the China Securities Investor Protection
Fund Company was also set up to monitor the risks and liquidation of securities firms that go bankrupt.

bond market from fully reaching its potential. In this context, streamlining the regulatory
responsibilities is also important. The authorities agreed that developing a more market-based
long-term corporate bond market is important, but argued that time was needed to strengthen
corporate governance, improve bankruptcy laws and regulations, and regulate market
intermediaries so as to strike a balance between market development and risk control.
46.
The staff emphasized the benefits of early participation in an FSAP, which would
help take stock of the recent significant progress in financial sector reforms and identify
priorities for further reforms. While the decision to participate was formally reached last
year, the authorities are still deciding on the appropriate time to launch the process.
B. Reform of State-Owned Enterprise
47.
Further progress in reform of the state-owned enterprises (SOEs) can play an
important role in improving investment decisions and rebalancing growth. As a group,
SOEs are now profitable on a flow basis, as legacy debts and social responsibilities have
been taken off their balance sheets. These profits have been largely reinvested, and this has
been a major contributor to the rise in investment in recent years. The staff encouraged the
authorities to exercise stronger governance over SOEs, including by seeking dividends from
profitable enterprises. Requiring dividend payments would be an important step in helping to
curb investment growth. Such payments should be channeled back to the government
through the budget and their use determined in the same manner as other government
revenue. The increased flow of income to the budget would provide an opportunity to
improve the public provision of social services. The authorities acknowledged that there was
a growing consensus among the various government agencies involved that it would be
appropriate for the SOEs to pay dividends on the government’s ownership stake in them.
A high-level task force had been set up to examine the issue and work out modalities for
dividend payments, although it was unclear how quickly this task force would reach a
consensus and make policy recommendations.
C. Rural-Urban Income Disparity
48.
One of the authorities’ major concerns is that the opportunity to share in the
benefits of growth is not accessible more equitably across all levels of society. In
particular, urban-rural income disparity has been growing, and the new five-year economic
blueprint puts top priority on measures to address this problem. Urban household incomes
have more than doubled in real terms in the past 10 years, and by 2005, urban incomes were
more than three times rural cash incomes. Rural residents also have less access to public
services than urban residents—state spending per capita on education, health, and social
welfare is lower in the more rural western provinces. In addition, residency requirements
limit rural residents’ access to social services in urban areas. Key steps envisaged are to
reduce barriers to rural-urban migration which will increase employment opportunities for
the rural workforce, of which an estimated 150 million are underemployed, and reduce the
pressure on arable land. In addition, migrants will be given greater access to vocational
training and social services in the cities. The authorities also plan to develop the countryside
by increasing agricultural support services, building rural infrastructure, and improving rural

26
education and health services. However, the budgetary resources to be devoted to these
measures are still unclear given the lack of a medium-term budget framework and
weaknesses in expenditure classification—problems that were being addressed.
D. Other Issues
49.
The authorities maintained that implementation of China’s WTO commitments
remains on track. Except for a few products, tariff reductions required under WTO
commitments have all taken effect by the beginning of 2005—the simple average tariff was
reduced to less than 10 percent in 2005 from 15¼ percent in 2001, just prior to WTO entry.
All commitments on removing non-tariff measures including import quotas, import licenses,
and import tendering have been implemented. Progress on the liberalization of services,
including banking, distribution, and telecommunication, is on track. Concrete regulations are
being drafted that would fully meet the WTO commitment to provide equal treatment to
foreign banks by end-2006. The authorities are fully committed to multilateral trade
liberalization and see regional and bilateral free trade agreements as supplementary to
multilateral agreements. They noted that the quick resolution of the trade friction with the
United States and the EU on some textile products has helped to maintain a stable trade
environment, but highlighted the existence of restrictions on China’s imports of hightechnology products.
50.
China provides significant financial support to low-income countries (LICs).
While China does not participate in the enhanced HIPC Initiative, it provides debt relief on a
bilateral basis to many countries although information by beneficiary is not available. The
provision of nonconcessional government loans to LICs by China raises some concerns,
particularly in the cases of those countries that have only recently received debt relief under
the HIPC initiative and the Multilateral Debt Relief Initiative. New nonconcessional lending
to still heavily indebted countries also may complicate the implementation of debt relief
initiatives, particularly as traditional bilateral creditors expect equal treatment for all foreign
government sponsored loans. In this regard, the staff urged the authorities to consider debt
and debt sustainability issues in making decisions on official loans to LICs and to exchange
with other bilateral lenders information on China’s lending activities and provision of debt
relief. The authorities stressed their commitment to carefully assessing loans to these
countries, and that the question of exchanging information on nonconcessional lending with
other donor countries was being considered by the appropriate agencies.
51.
The staff welcomed improvements in the quality of economic statistics. In
particular, the revision to the national income accounts to better reflect previously
under-recorded sectors of the economy and reporting of data on the international investment
position are welcome achievements. While Chinese data are adequate for surveillance
purposes, inadequacies in several areas still constrain the monitoring of macroeconomic
developments. The staff suggested that priority should be given to further improving the
national income accounts, including publication of annual and quarterly real GDP on an
expenditure basis and providing better data on investment, especially on the change in
business inventories. Other important areas for improvement are labor statistics, financial
sector data (including developing comprehensive data on financial soundness indicators), and
some aspects of the balance of payments accounts.

27
IV. STAFF APPRAISAL
52.
If China is to sustain rapid and stable economic growth over the medium term,
the economy needs to be rebalanced away from heavy dependence on investment and
exports as primary sources of growth and towards consumption. The government will
need to play an important role in achieving such a boost to consumption through efforts to
further reform and develop the financial sector and by increasing spending on health care,
education, and pensions. This will serve to reduce households’ precautionary savings.
Moreover, the opportunity to share in the benefits of growth need to be spread more
equitably across all levels of society.
53.
Prospects for the future remain favorable, provided that policy actions are taken
to address the risks and challenges China faces. The key immediate concern remains that
rapid investment growth is leading to substantial overcapacity in some sectors. Abundant
liquidity in the banking system could touch off further increases in lending growth and
investment, with the probable consequence of creating new non-performing loans and
undoing some of the progress made in reforming the banking sector. On the external front,
growing protectionist sentiment in China’s major markets could curb growth. In addition, a
disorderly unwinding of global imbalances would have serious adverse effects on China’s
economy, as activity in the rest of the world would be adversely affected. There are also
mounting challenges to economic policy on the domestic front, as the gap between incomes
of rural and urban areas continues to widen.
54.
The authorities recognize the need in the near term to contain investment and
credit growth, and they have tightened monetary policy in response and have taken a
number of administrative steps. However, with substantial liquidity remaining in the banking
system, continuing large capital inflows, local government pressure on banks to expand their
lending, and restraint on credit growth by the large banks diminishing as they complete their
recapitalizations, additional steps are required. If there is a concern that further tightening of
monetary policy would attract additional capital inflows, this only underscores the
importance of draining liquidity from the banking system in conjunction with allowing
greater exchange rate appreciation. More rapid appreciation of the renminbi along with an
intensification of open market operations is needed. These steps may have to be
supplemented by other measures to tighten monetary conditions, including further hikes in
benchmark interest rates and/or the reserve requirement ratio.
55.
More broadly, the effectiveness of monetary instruments needs to be improved.
The burden of having to tightly manage the exchange rate has created a major conflict in
monetary policy implementation. To circumvent this conflict, the authorities have relied on
moral suasion and administrative controls to restrain credit and investment growth and keep
inflation low. While such controls may be necessary in the short term, over time the
effectiveness of administrative controls will diminish as the sophistication of the economy
increases, while the potential costs of the distortions that these controls create grow larger. At
the same time, trying to influence bank lending decisions directly contradicts the
government’s goal of creating a banking sector operating on a sound commercial basis.

28
56.
Thus, exchange rate flexibility, not just appreciation, is what is needed for
China’s economy going forward. Allowing the exchange rate to move more flexibly and be
increasingly determined by market conditions would enhance monetary policy independence,
helping the central bank to meet its policy objectives and reducing interference in the
operations of the commercial banks. The lack of sufficient discretion given to the PBC to set
interest rates is also an impediment to timely policy action.
57.
Over time, it will be important for the PBC to formalize its policy framework,
establishing an appropriate nominal anchor for monetary policy, and more clearly articulate
its policy objectives. This would help to underpin market expectations about inflation,
interest rates, and the exchange rate. In this regard, the now regular publication of the
Monetary Policy Report by the PBC provides a convenient vehicle to increase the
transparency of monetary policy formulation.
58.
Now is the time to more fully utilize the flexibility afforded by the current
exchange rate system and allow greater movement in the renminbi-U.S. dollar exchange
rate and a further significant appreciation of the currency in nominal effective terms.
This is in China's best interest and the timing is right, as such an appreciation is unlikely to
create significant economic disruptions given the strength of the Chinese economy. An
appreciation of the currency will also contribute to the sustainability of China’s growth. It
would help avert the build-up of short-term foreign currency liabilities that will occur if the
exchange rate remains undervalued and financial repression continues, reducing the risk of
what could be a significant source of vulnerability. In addition, it will also help to improve
the allocation of investment and its efficiency by giving the right price signals to potential
investors. By increasing households’ purchasing power, and thereby boosting consumption, it
would aid in rebalancing the economy over the medium term. In any event, if adjustment to
the undervaluation of the exchange rate does not come through a nominal appreciation, at
some point in time a real appreciation of the currency will occur through higher inflation, and
this would have a disproportionately adverse impact on the poor and rural households.
Concerns about adverse short-term effects of an appreciation can be addressed through other,
more appropriate policy actions than by continuing to tightly manage the exchange rate.
59.
In addition to serving China’s own interest, greater exchange rate flexibility
would play a role in contributing to an orderly process for resolving global current
account imbalances. A disorderly correction of these imbalances would have lingering
adverse effects on all countries. Dealing with global imbalances requires a concerted effort
on the part of all countries. In this respect China can play an important role in reducing
imbalances through policy actions that are in its own interest, including greater flexibility in
the exchange rate, which would permit a significant appreciation, coupled with China’s
structural reforms aimed at rebalancing economic growth.
60.
The last few years of fiscal consolidation have created the space to step up social
spending, which is needed to help rebalance growth towards consumption. In this regard,
the 2006 budget is appropriate from a near-term perspective. Ad hoc or overly ambitious
spending increases now that exceeds implementation capacity would be wasteful. Instead,
building on some of the current pilot projects, comprehensive plans to reform the provision
of social services (such as health care, education, and pensions) can be developed. In the

29
absence of such concrete plans and adequate controls to finance and monitor a substantial
increase in social spending, the authorities should continue to shift the composition of
expenditures towards social areas in line with their capacity to effectively implement higher
spending in these areas. A key part of effective efforts to raise social spending is continuing
reform of the budget process, including by putting in place as scheduled the revised budget
classification and chart of accounts, and fully implementing the treasury single account. This
would help increase fiscal transparency and ensure that funds are actually spent for their
intended purpose.
61.
Center-local fiscal relations are in need of significant reform, and such reform is
an important part of efforts to rebalance the economy and spread the benefits of
growth. Income disparities across regions continue to widen, with some localities facing
difficulties in funding expenditure mandates especially in health and education. These
structural imbalances in subnational finances need to be addressed, including by assessing
the possibility of reforming tax assignments across levels of government, rebalancing
expenditure responsibilities in line with resources, and reforming the transfer system to move
toward a more rule-based system that ensures all local governments have resources adequate
to meet their spending responsibilities.
62.
Improving intermediation of China’s large private savings remains critical to
medium-term economic prospects and for rebalancing economic growth. As banks
increasingly operate on a commercial basis, the allocation efficiency is likely to improve,
while a wider range of household credit instruments would enable households to borrow
against future income, which should bring down their saving rate. Implementation of
improved risk management systems should also make banks more willing to meet the
borrowing needs of small- and medium-size enterprises. While the authorities have shown
substantial progress in bank reform, further fundamental improvements are also required in
the banks’ commercial orientation, internal controls, and governance. Government
involvement in the management and business operations of the banks should continue to be
cut and eliminated over time. Banking supervision should be strengthened further, in
particular with regard to assessing banks’ foreign exchange and credit risks. Closer
monitoring of the flow of new non-performing loans also is essential so that potential
problems can be detected early.
63.
Particular attention needs to be given to moving quickly to adopt a reform plan
for the Agricultural Bank of China. Further delay in reforming ABC risks creating serious
moral hazard that could undermine the reforms of other banks. The authorities should move
quickly to adopt an ambitious reform plan, including time-bound restructuring and
recapitalization measures with appropriate performance parameters. If the intention is to
reform ABC in the context of a comprehensive rural financing reform plan (for which more
time may be needed), then interim restraints should be placed on the ABC’s lending
activities.
64.
Additional steps are needed to accelerate the development of China’s capital
markets. These markets have been mired in complex regulations and plagued by governance
problems. Developing bond and equity markets is important for improving intermediation
and increasing incentives for banks to seek out small- and medium-size enterprises. It will

30
serve to boost consumption by proving greater opportunities for direct and indirect household
participation in the financial markets. Expanding the bond market also would help lower
corporate savings, reducing enterprises’ substantial reliance on internal savings by providing
a broader set of financial instruments to raise funds. The authorities have made progress in
reviving equity markets, but more needs to be done to ease access to the market and allow
stocks to be publicly issued based on firms’ disclosure of financial data and prospects.
Progress on developing the corporate bond market has been less encouraging. The
development of the short-term corporate bills market, along with launching the interbank
market for asset-backed securities, are steps in the right direction. However, advances in
developing the longer-term corporate bond market has been disappointing, and the
implementation of the new Securities Law to date appears to have done little to remove key
impediments and streamline regulatory responsibilities. In particular, reforms are needed to
replace the current “merit” based bond issuance system, requiring government selection of
each bond issue, with a disclosure-based system and to eliminate the cap on corporate bond
interest rates.
65.
Early participation in an FSAP would be beneficial, as it would help take stock of
the recent significant progress in financial sector reforms and identify priorities for further
reforms.
66.
Exercising stronger governance over enterprises where the government owns
shares would be an important step contributing to rebalancing growth. Central to
strengthening governance over the SOEs would be requiring them to make dividend
payments to the budget. Reinvested enterprise profits have contributed to the sharp rise in
investment in some sectors of the economy and have aggravated demand management by
generating procyclical investment. Requiring that dividend payments be made to the budget
would improve the efficiency of investment and increase public sector resources to fund
reforms in social services.
67.
The IMF staff welcomes improvements in the quality of economic statistics,
although incomplete data in several areas still affects the monitoring of macroeconomic
developments. The revision to the national income accounts to better reflect previously
under-recorded sectors of the economy and the reporting of data on the international
investment position are welcome achievements. However, inadequate data in several areas
still constrain the monitoring of macroeconomic developments. Priority should be given to
publication of annual and quarterly real GDP on an expenditure basis; improving labor
statistics; providing data that would facilitate on-going monitoring of the financial sector;
measuring investment better; addressing the lack of reliable data on the change in business
inventories; and improving some aspects of balance of payments statistics.
68.
The authorities' provision of financial support and debt relief to many lowincome countries is welcome. We encourage the authorities to share information on these
activities with staff, participate fully in the HIPC initiatives, and make their lending activities
consistent with the low-income country debt sustainability framework.
69.
It is proposed that the next Article IV consultation with China take place on the
standard 12-month cycle.

1/ The breakdown of debt by debtor and coverage of entities were changed in 2001. In addition, loans from foreign
governments to policy banks are moved from debt of government category to debt of Chinese-funded financial institutions
from end-2003 onward. The adjustment was $15.2 billion at end-2003. In 2001, trade credits and loans borrowed by foreign
funded financial institutions are included. Their stock at end-2001 was 38.7 billion. In 2005, switching to sample based
estimation increased trade credit for 2001 onwards and by $14.7 billion for 2001 compared with methods used previously.

ANNEX I: CHINA—DEBT SUSTAINABILITY ANALYSIS
1.
An analysis of the sustainability of China’s government debt (based on the
standard Fund framework) does not point to major difficulties over the next few years,
although, over the longer term, large quasi-fiscal liabilities and rising expenditure
pressures might translate into key sources of potential fiscal vulnerability. The standard
Fund framework cannot be easily extended to longer horizons because data limitations
preclude precise estimates of quasi-fiscal liabilities; there are also considerable uncertainties
in trying to gauge the magnitude of potential expenditure pressures over the longer term.12
2.
China’s official government debt is low, estimated at below 18 percent of GDP at
end-2005.13 However, on a gross basis it could be significantly larger if quasi-fiscal liabilities
were included; while on a net basis could be smaller if China used its substantial stock of
state assets to net out government debt obligations. Contingent liabilities include
nonperforming loans (NPLs) in the banking system, unfunded pension obligations, and
external borrowings by state-owned enterprises (SOEs). Owing to lack of data, this debt
sustainability analysis only includes estimated losses from reported NPLs and the minimum
transition costs of shifting to a viable pension system.14 However, potential data weaknesses
and inevitable problems in implementing new prudential regimes suggest that the scale of
problem loans may be higher. Transition costs of the pension reform could also be
substantially higher, depending on the magnitude of changes to the pension parameters.
Liabilities, direct and contingent, of local governments are not included, as no information is
available.15 Moreover, potential pressures on spending are expected to intensify over time,
especially due to an ageing population; however, their fiscal impact would mainly fall
outside of the medium-term horizon covered here.
3.
The debt sustainability analysis is based on the staff’s macroeconomic
projections and on the authorities’ medium-term fiscal framework. Key assumptions
include:
12

For an assessment of longer-term fiscal sustainability issues, see “Medium-Term Fiscal Challenges” in
China’s Growth and Integration into the World Economy: Prospects and Challenges IMF Occasional Paper
232, edited by E. Prasad (Chapter VI).
13

This estimated stock includes regular issues of bonds to finance the central government’s budget deficits, as
well as the bonds issued to recapitalize the four state-owned commercial banks in 1998 and bonds used for onlending to local governments.

14

Based on authorities’ data, the stock of NPLs is estimated to amount to about 25 percent of GDP at end-2005
(also including the stock of NPLs originally transferred to AMCs, amounting to about 8 percent of 2005 GDP).
In the DSA exercise shown in Table I.1, it is assumed that NPLs have a recovery rate of about 20 percent; for
the projections of future NPLs, it is assumed that 16 percent of new loans will eventually become
nonperforming. Unfunded pension liabilities equivalent to 7 percent of GDP are assumed to be covered by the
budget in 2007; interest will also be paid on these and the bonds issued to cover NPLs as of 2008.

15

While not allowed to borrow directly by law, local governments have indirect access to borrowing through
onlending from the central government, and through public enterprises, especially to fund infrastructure
projects. This indirect financing (for which estimates are not available) carries fiscal risks for the local
governments and, ultimately, the central government

•

GDP growth is projected to gradually decelerate to 8.5 percent a year in 2011.

•

The deficit will be held constant at its projected 2008 level (1 percent of GDP).

•

The average domestic real interest rate increases gradually to 2.5 percent within five
years, reflecting gradual liberalization of the financial sector.

4.
Under these assumptions, the debt-to-GDP ratio would have a step increase in
2007 (to about 45 percent of GDP), but then would resume a gradually declining path
over the projection period (Table I.1 and Figure I.1). The sensitivity analysis suggests that
fiscal sustainability may not be a major concern over the next few years, provided that
structural reforms continue to be implemented. To take into account the uncertainties about
the future macroeconomic conditions, spending needs, and the actual level of contingent
liabilities, the effects of maintaining an unchanged primary position and all the key variables
at their historical levels were simulated. In both cases, the debt-to-GDP ratio would increase,
reflecting, in particular, the historically higher real interest rate and larger primary deficit
than recorded in more recent years and projected for the future.
5.
Isolated or combined temporary adverse shocks on these key variables would
only increase the debt-to-GDP ratio in the short run (Figure I.1).
•

Individual temporary shocks. A temporarily lower GDP growth rate would increase
the debt-to-GDP ratio to about 45 percent in 2007, similar to the effect produced by a
higher real interest rate. Under both cases, the debt ratio would then resume a
declining path as in the baseline scenario.

•

Combined temporary shocks. Should GDP growth be slower, the real interest rate
higher, and public spending more expansionary all at the same time (by one standard
deviation), the debt-to-GDP ratio would increase and remain at about 46 percent of
GDP over the projection period.

•

Higher initial public debt stock. If debt-creating flows were to be 10 percentage
points of GDP higher in 2007, the debt-to-GDP ratio would reach about 55 percent in
2007, but gradually fall over the medium term.

ANNEX II: CHINA’S FISCAL REFORMS AND TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE
1.
In recent years, the Fund has provided technical assistance in a number of areas
(Table II.1). This annex focuses on the main issues and recommendations in the fiscal area.
Fiscal Technical Assistance Program
2.
FAD has largely provided advice on tax policy, tax administration, and budget and
treasury reforms.
Tax policy
3.
The scope of the Fund TA work in this area has been quite comprehensive, covering
every major tax: the value-added tax (VAT), the business tax, the enterprise income tax
(EIT), and the personal income tax (PIT), or the tax treatment of specific sectors (i.e.,
financial sector).
4.
On the VAT, the focus of the Fund’s TA advice on the VAT has been on
transforming it into a consumption-type VAT (now being piloted). As there are important
revenue and central-province intergovernmental implications of the VAT reform, the Fund
has paid particular attention to alternative transition strategies. The Fund’s TA advice has
also focused on improving the structure of the EIT, including the unification of the regimes
applying separately to domestic and foreign enterprises, and rationalizing and reducing the
scope of EIT incentives. Steps are underway for EIT unification. For the PIT, whose yield is
still relatively insignificant, its structure should be streamlined and its rates simplified; the
authorities have recently increased the PIT income exemption threshold, along the lines of
previous Fund’s advice. In addition, the liberalization of the financial sector under the WTO
commitments has important tax implications, some of which already covered by Fund TA; a
mission is currently advising the authorities on the VAT treatment of financial services.
Finally, the authorities have also expressed interest in receiving TA on streamlining real
estate taxes, which are an important revenue handle for local governments.
Tax administration
5.
The authorities have been putting in place the basic building blocks of a modern
national tax administration. In this regard, the Fund TA program has aimed at assisting the
State Administration of Taxation (SAT) to develop the strategic capacity required for it to
manage a national tax system, with assistance provided to both the central and provincial
governments. Information technology development has been satisfactorily completed and
risk management techniques have been introduced to SAT and to its provincial managers.

45

Despite progress, the SAT is yet to adopt a nationally consistent organizational structure. As
an initial step, Fund TA would advise on an appropriate structure, its implications and needed
changes. There is also a need to strengthen other aspects of SAT operational effectiveness,
for example by improving compliance management and developing self-assessment
practices. Planned TA activities for 2006 will cover business process reengineering,
information technology, risk assessment, and taxpayer services.
Public financial management
6.
In order to improve the efficiency of public spending, a number of budget and
treasury reforms are being implemented, including broader budget coverage and
establishment of a treasury single account (TSA) at the central level, now being rolled out to
the provincial level.16 These efforts have been supported by Fund’s extensive technical
assistance. In line with the authorities’ request, in 2006 the Fund will provide TA on
reforming the Budget Law and strengthening the cash management system.
Intergovernmental fiscal relations
7.
In recent years, the authorities have become increasingly aware of the need to reform
the system of intergovernmental fiscal relations, as imbalances between the center and
subnational levels are growing and regional disparities are widening. There is a need to
clarify expenditure mandates, including by centralizing some spending responsibilities such
as pensions. Revenue sharing and the design of the transfer system also need to be reformed.
8.
Building on past activities in these areas, the Fund stands ready to provide TA on the
reform of the system of intergovernmental fiscal relations.

16

A standard Treasury Single Account (TSA) is a centralized bank account or a set of linked bank accounts
through which the government, including its entities and spending units, transacts all receipts and payments and
consolidates its cash balances.

Exchange Arrangements:

1.
China’s exchange rate regime is currently classified as a conventional peg to a single
currency17. On July 21, 2005, the People’s Bank of China (PBC) announced that the exchange
rate of the renminbi against the U.S. dollar would be revalued upward by about 2.1 percent
17

On July 21, 2005, China announced a 2.1 percent revaluation of the renminbi-U.S. dollar exchange rate and a
change in its exchange rate arrangement to allow the value of the renminbi to fluctuate based on market supply
and demand with reference to an undisclosed basket of currencies. To permit a greater role for market forces in
determining the renminbi exchange rate, steps have been taken since July 2005 to liberalize and develop
China’s foreign exchange markets, including the establishment of an over-the-counter spot foreign exchange
market and markets for currency swaps and futures. From end-July 2005 to end-April 2006, the renminbi’s
exchange rate was more flexible, but, the fluctuation in the renminbi-U.S. dollar exchange rate was less than the
2 percent range (for a three-month period) used in the IMF’s de facto exchange rate classification scheme as an
indicator for a conventional fixed peg exchange rate arrangement.

49
(from RMB 8.28/US$ to RMB 8.11/US$) and the exchange rate regime would move to a
managed float in which renminbi’s value is set with reference to a basket of currencies. The
stated intention of the Chinese authorities was to increase the flexibility of the renminbi’s
exchange rate. The authorities indicated that they will not publish the currencies in the reference
basket and their relative weights, and many of the operational details regarding the new
arrangement remained unclear at that time. The PBC indicated that it would adjust the exchange
rate trading band as necessary to reflect market developments and financial and economic
conditions. Under the new regime, the band around the daily trading price of the US dollar
against the RMB was kept at ± 0.3 percent around the central parity published by the PBC while
the trade prices of the non-US dollar currencies against the RMB were allowed to move within a
certain band announced by PBC, which was initially set at ±1.5 percent and increased to ±3
percent in September 2005. In August 2005, the governor of PBC revealed that U.S. dollars,
Euro, Japanese Yen, won of the Republic of Korea were the main currencies included in the
basket, and UK pound, the Thai baht, and the Russian ruble were among other currencies
included in the basket. The weights were not disclosed.

2.
On January 4, 2006 over-the-counter (OTC) trading of spot foreign exchange was
introduced with 13 banks initially designated as market makers. The centralized spot foreign
exchange trading system (CFETS) remains operative, but its central parity rate (renminbi against
the U.S. dollar) is now based on a weighted average of CFETS and OTC transactions. Under the
new system, CFETS first inquires prices from all market makers before the opening of the market
in each business day, exclude the highest and lowest offers, and then calculate the weighted
average of the remaining prices in the sample as the central rate of the RMB against the
US dollar for the day. This is in contrast to the previous arrangement where the central parity rate
was the closing price of the previous day in the CFETS. The weights for the market makers,
which remain undisclosed, are determined by the CFETS in line with the transaction volumes of
the respective market makers in the market. On June 20, 2006 the RMB/dollar rate stood at
8.0036.
3.
China accepted the obligations of Article VIII, Sections 2, 3, and 4 of the Fund’s Articles
of Agreement on December 1, 1996. There are repatriation and surrender requirements on
proceeds from exports and from invisible transactions and current transfers. Starting on May 1,
2006, all enterprises (domestic institutions) having foreign exchange revenue from foreign
operation or from current accounts may keep foreign exchange equivalent to the sum of 80
percent of their previous year’s foreign exchange revenue and 50 percent of current account
foreign exchange expenditure. Domestic institutions that had no current account foreign
exchange revenue in the previous year are allowed to retain an initial limit of foreign exchange
revenue equivalent to US$500,000. There are no measures currently in force that have been
determined to be exchange restrictions subject to Fund jurisdiction.
4.
Exchange controls continue to apply to most capital transactions, but are being relaxed.
Effective on July 1, 2006, quotas on foreign exchange purchases for foreign direct investment
(FDI) was abolished, and domestic investors were allowed to purchase foreign exchange to
finance pre-FDI activities. Since December 1, 2002, qualified foreign institutional investors
(QFIIs) have been allowed to invest domestically in A shares, subject to certain restrictions, and

50
all nonresidents have been allowed to purchase B shares, which are denominated in U.S. dollars
or Hong Kong dollars. The Qualified Domestic Institutional Investor (QDII) scheme was
introduced in 2004, and new regulations are under preparation to allow qualified banks, asset
management companies and insurance companies to invest abroad. To promote the development
of QDII, starting on May 1, 2006, residents can purchase up to $20,000 foreign exchange for
depositing in banks or for current account transactions. Beyond the quota, purchases require
relevant documents. In 2004, international financial institutions were approved to raise funds
domestically in renminbi for use offshore, while other nonresidents are still not permitted to issue
capital or money market securities in the domestic market. An annual foreign borrowing plan sets
mandatory ceilings for all medium- and long-term borrowing by government departments and
enterprises (except FFEs which are subject to individual limits negotiated in the investment
approval process).
VIII. Article IV Consultation:

5.
The Board discussion for the 2005 Article IV consultation was concluded on August 3,
2005 and the staff report was published on November 17, 2005. China is on the standard
12-month consultation cycle. The 2006 Article IV mission was concluded on May 26, 2006.

ANNEX IV: CHINA—STATISTICAL ISSUES
1.
While China’s economic statistics are adequate for surveillance purposes, weakness
remain in the quality of the data, including coverage, frequency and timeliness. Nevertheless,
China has made significant strides in bringing its economic and financial statistics into line
with international good practice. In April 2002, China began participation in the Fund’s
GDDS and its metadata were posted on the Fund’s DSBB (the most comprehensive
documentation of Chinese economic and financial statistics available in English). The most
recent metadata updates were received in April 2005 and 2006 updates are expected
imminently. STA held a workshop and a high-level seminar on the use of macroeconomic
statistics for policy analysis and decision making in China in January 2005. A STA mission
in May 2006 discussed the key issues of macroeconomic statistics and the likely follow-up
activities. The main statistical issues are noted below.
Real sector statistics
2.
Data on the expenditure components of GDP are not available on a quarterly basis.
Annual GDP by expenditure is compiled at current and constant 2000 prices, but the constant
price estimates are not published. Quarterly data are produced in cumulative form, with
minimal revisions of previous data, making it difficult to assess quarterly developments
accurately or to make seasonal adjustments. Constant price measures of GDP needs to be
improved because of deficiencies with the price indices and techniques used to derive the
estimates. Nevertheless, the National Bureau of Statistics has made a number of
improvements to the range and quality of national accounts data, including quarterly
estimates of GDP by industry and estimates of GDP by type of expenditure. Further
improvements are intended, including the adoption of the 1993 System of National Accounts,
further development of income and expenditure data, and improvements to quarterly GDP
estimates. However, no target dates have been set. As in other countries, rapid economic
change, including the expansion of the nonstate sector, presents new problems for data
compilation. The ability to change the collection of data is restricted by the decentralized
nature of the statistical system. Extensive technical assistance has been provided from
multilateral and bilateral institutions.
3.
At the end of 2005, the NBS released revised estimates of GDP for 2004. The
revisions were based on the results of an economic census conducted at the beginning of
2005, which improved the coverage of services and the second industry activities. Based on the
2004 data, a standard statistical technique (the trend-deviation method) was then used to
revise the data back to 1993. The revisions resulted in a significant upward shift in the
estimated levels of GDP.
4.
Monthly industrial production, retail sales, and fixed investment data also have a
shifting base that does not permit the production of a consistent time series. Data revisions
tend to be made without publishing the entire revised series.

52
5.
Labor market statistics—including employment and wage data—are not
comprehensive, and are only available on an annual basis, with considerable lag.
6.
Prior to December 2000, the consumer price index was not produced in a time series
format, as there were only comparisons between the current month and the previous month,
and the current month with the same month of the previous year. For most items, the weights
were for the previous year’s expenditures with the other weights being updated each month.
Technical assistance missions in September 1991, April 1995, and June 1997 dealt with the
concepts and methodology of internationally used index formulae. The authorities have
received technical assistance and training on price index methodology under a cooperative
program with Statistics Canada. A technical assistance mission in August 1999 reviewed the
methodology to compile fixed-base price indices in test projects in four provinces and found
that only in one province the index was adequate. In January 2001, the NBS began to publish
an annually-chained Laspeyres price index, which more accurately reflects consumer
spending patterns (e.g., the weight of services increased, while the weight of food declined).
The number of survey items has been expanded to around 700. The most recent weights of
the major CPI components were provided to the staff in 2006.
Government finance statistics
7.
Serious data shortcomings continue to hamper fiscal analysis. Budgetary data exclude
spending associated with domestic bond proceeds on-lent to local governments and official
external borrowing. Also, data on the social and extra budgetary funds are only provided
annually and with a long lag. Expenditure classification remains very poor, mainly because
data are not classified by economic type. However, the situation should improve with the
introduction of a revised budget classification system, starting with the 2007 budget.
8.
China has reported relatively detailed central government and local government
budget data for 2003 for publication in the 2005 GFS Yearbook. No data are provided on
government debt and only limited data were submitted for STA’s review on the operations of
extrabudgetary funds. The revenue classification does not fully distinguish between revenue
and grants, tax and nontax revenue, and current and capital revenue. The presentation of
expenditure is primarily by function and does not fully comply with international best
practice. The authorities have agreed to resubmit a more comprehensive set of data on
general government for review by STA’s Government Finance Division.
Monetary and financial statistics
9.
In recent years, improvements have been made in the classification of accounts of the
monetary authorities and banking institutions. From 2002, compilation and reporting of
monetary data include foreign-currency-denominated accounts of residents and accounts of
the branches of foreign banks.

53
10.
The monetary and banking surveys lack sufficient detail with regard to bank claims
on the government, hampering the estimation of the fiscal deficit from the financing side.
The PBC has also ceased to report separate data on central government deposits in its balance
sheet since April 2005 because the MOF no longer distinguishes between central and other
government deposit accounts. This change will lead to breaks in data series of monetary base
and monetary aggregates. In addition, detailed breakdowns of bank credit extended by
industry, and by borrower (including by the various elements of the state and nonstate
sectors), are not publicly available. The staff continues to encourage the authorities to report
information of this nature for analytical purposes.
11.
Due to the restructuring of the banking sector, new statistical issues have arisen, such
as how to record the transfer of non-performing loans to asset management companies, and
how to classify these companies in the banking survey. The monetary and financial statistics
mission that visited Beijing in early 2005 made recommendations for addressing these issues.
12.
The reported net foreign assets position of PBC does not include exchange rate
valuation effects nor interest earnings on foreign reserves.
13.
The most notable progress made by the PBC on monetary statistics is as follows:
(1) expanding the coverage of financial institutions; (2) adjusting the classification of
financial corporations; (3) improving the “all accounts” reporting system and (4) improving
its data dissemination following the GDDS recommendations, such as disseminating advance
release calendars on the PBC’s websites, and reporting to the IMF using the integrated
correspondence system. On financial soundness indicators, China is in the process of
establishing its own system of financial soundness indicators and at this stage is soliciting
comments on the new system from all relevant agencies.
External sector statistics
14.
The State Administration of Foreign Exchange (SAFE) relies on an International
Transactions Reporting System (ITRS) which produces data derived from information on
foreign exchange transactions conducted by banks. To supplement the ITRS, data on travel
credits and trade credits are collected through periodic sample surveys, while additional data
are collected from other government agencies and reports on balance sheet information from
financial institutions and data on portfolio investment and direct investment.
15.
The data are compiled (in U.S. dollars) largely in accordance with the fifth edition of
the Balance of Payments Manual (BPM5). Semi-annual (January-June) data are compiled
and disseminated within three to five months after the end of the reference period while
annual data are disseminated four to five months following the end of the reference period. It
appears that the authorities may be close to being able to publish quarterly estimates of the
balance of payments. Within the current account, component detail is available on goods,

54
services, income, and transfers. Data on the financial account are also available with
significant component detail for functional categories, but with limited sectoral breakdown.
The international investment position for 2004 and 2005 were published in May 2006.
16.
The Fund has provided extensive technical assistance for China to improve balance of
payments and IIP statistics. In August 2002 a seminar was held on Balance of Payments and
IIP statistics in Chengdu, and a seminar on IIP statistics was delivered in Shanghai in
April 2005. The coverage of direct investment transactions remains a problematic issue in the
Chinese balance of payments and IIP statistics. Data on these transactions, received mainly
from the Ministry of Commerce (formerly Ministry of Foreign Trade and Cooperation),
apparently do not cover all required elements such as disinvestments, while the direct
investment survey has not provided reliable data. Since ITRS is the major data source for
BOP in China, in order to ensure its smooth operation, regular training programs for staff in
the provincial offices of SAFE were recommended. In addition, in January 2003 a legislative
guarantee for the improvement of the quality of ITRS reporting entitled “The Checking
System on Balance of Payments Reporting Data (experimental)” was promulgated by the
SAFE.
17.
SAFE officials reported during a visit to STA in December 2005 that there have been
some improvements in external sector statistics, including the dissemination of higher
frequency balance of payments statistics, and the new Management Information System
(MIS) for compiling balance of payments and IIP statistics that would become operational in
2006.
18.
The Fund has also provided technical assistance on the coverage, timeliness, and
periodicity of China’s data on official reserves, reserves-related liabilities, as well as on other
external assets and liabilities, financial derivative activities, and other contingent and
potential liabilities. In the December 2003 GDDS progress review, the authorities indicated
that they had completed the preparatory work for completing the template on international
reserves and foreign currency liquidity in accordance with the SDDS and that there were no
technical problems remaining. The authorities also noted that the definition and coverage of
China’s external debt data follow closely the External Debt Statistics: Guide for Compilers
and Users. Such data are compiled monthly but published on a quarterly basis (monthly data
have not been provided to Fund staff on a regular basis). Despite an ostensibly modest level
of external vulnerability, there remains a need to strengthen external debt monitoring and
compilation, while introducing additional transparency in data dissemination. STA conducted
a seminar on external debt statistics in August 2005 as part of the China Training Program.
19.
In April 2004, STA conducted a seminar in Xianyang, Xi An China on the
Coordinated Portfolio Investment Survey (CPIS) to explain the concepts and practical issues
involved in undertaking the survey. There was active participation in the seminar although no
commitment was made at that time to participate in the CPIS.

55
Data reporting to STA for publications
20.
In June 1999, the PBC resumed reporting monthly monetary data and has agreed to
their publication in IFS. These improvements in reporting notwithstanding, a number of
breaks remain in the series, and comparable historical data are not available. Balance of
payments data are reported on an annual basis for publication in the Balance of Payments
Statistics Yearbook and the IFS.
21.
Reporting of data to STA for IFS has, in the past, tended to be sporadic and with a
considerable time lag. Following the introduction of new reporting arrangements, the
timeliness of consumer price, industrial production, trade value, and total GDP data in IFS
has improved substantially. However, the range of information is relatively limited, with no
data published on producer prices, wages, trade volumes or prices/unit values.
Data dissemination to the public
22.
The publication of a quarterly statistical bulletin by the PBC has significantly
improved the timing and coverage of publicly available data on the monetary accounts and
the main real sector indicators. However, the monthly statistical publications do not contain
many time series (e.g. unemployment) or the disaggregation necessary for analysis.
Moreover, several important time series, particularly on the main fiscal variables, are not
released in a systematic and timely manner. Extensive annual economic data are available in
various statistical yearbooks, but these are published nine months or more after the end of the
year.

ANNEX V: CHINA—RELATIONS WITH THE WORLD BANK18
1.
The World Bank has been active in China since 1980. World Bank commitments to
China as of June 7, 2006 totaled about $40.4 billion for 270 projects. About 80 of these
projects are still under implementation, making China's portfolio the largest in the Bank.
World Bank-supported projects are found in almost all parts of China and in many sectors of
the economy, with infrastructure (transport, energy, industry, urban development) accounting
for more than half of the total portfolio, and rural development, social sectors (health,
education, social protection), and direct poverty reduction comprising the remainder.
A strong environment focus runs across sectors, and environment-related projects in energy,
urban wastewater, water supply and sanitation, and rural development together account for
around 60 percent of the IBRD portfolio.
2.
In FY2006, lending is projected to total about $1.45 billion in IBRD loans for eleven
projects. Given the increased availability of domestic financing—as a result of China's fiscal
stimulus policy—and a shift of the government's development program to the central and
western areas, the focus of the World Bank's assistance program is now on the poorer and
institutionally weaker inland provinces. As a consequence, the amount of lending per project
has been scaled back to suit the absorptive capacity of those provinces, leading to a lower
lending level compared with the mid-1990s. By sector, the projects to be approved in
FY2006 include two supporting agricultural development in poor rural areas, four for urban
environmental and transportation improvements in Shanghai, Fuzhou, Henan, and Liaoning,
projects supporting highways and inland waterways to improve access to interior provinces,
one for renewable energy, one for integrated land and watershed management in the
Changjiang/Pearl River Watershed, and one technical assistance project. A summary of Bank
commitments and disbursement to China is given in Table V.1. Details of the sectoral
breakdown of past lending can be found in Table V.2.
3.
Over the next two years, lending is expected to range from $2.0-3.0 billion, with
support provided to the development of infrastructure, agriculture and health in the interior
provinces and in the provinces of NE China, and urban management and the environment
principally in these areas. Since China is no longer borrowing IDA funds, the Bank, in
collaboration with the government and the United Kingdom’s Department for International
Development (DFID), is currently blending grant resources with IBRD loans, resulting in
more concessional loans (at an interest rate of about 2 percent) for selected projects in the
social and rural sectors. The FY2004 Basic Education Project and FY2005 Poor Rural
Communities Development Project were supported by this mechanism. In FY2007 a rural
water supply and sanitation project is also expected to benefit from this mechanism.

Prepared by World Bank staff.

58
4.
The new World Bank Group Country Partnership Strategy (CPS), endorsed by the
WB Board in May 2006, covers both lending and non-lending activities and is designed to
support the five strategic focal areas consistent with China’s 11th Five Year Program:
integrating China into the world economy, reducing poverty and inequality, addressing
resource scarcities and environmental challenges, strengthening the financial sector, and
improving market and public institutions.
5.
In addition to financial assistance, the provision of non-financial services in the form
of technical assistance, policy advice, seminars and training is an essential part of the
partnership program. The government has strongly endorsed Bank efforts to make its
non-lending activities more responsive to the country's evolving needs, by having a better
balance between detailed studies of issues requiring lengthy technical analysis and quick
delivery of briefer policy notes, supplemented by other forms of collaboration such as
senior-level workshops. Some recent or upcoming outputs include: support to formulation of
the 11th Five-Year Plan; quarterly economic updates and a series of policy notes covering
topics ranging from intergovernmental fiscal policies to health care to state enterprise
dividends; a study of public service unit reform; an economic memorandum on managing
scarce resources; and studies of foreign capital utilization. In FY2006, the World Bank has
been assisting on, inter alia, on the following areas: (i) poverty and vulnerability, including a
poverty assessment, a major study of rural health care reform, and analysis of social
protection pilots, and rural connectivity; (ii) managing resource scarcity and environment,
including studies on land policy, water scarcity, and metropolitan area management;
(iii) financing rapid growth, including a financial sector program focused on access to
finance, financial stability, and capital markets; (iv) improving public and market
institutions, including the Northeast Revitalization strategy, and studies on sub-national fiscal
reforms, rural finance, local investment climates, and public service delivery.
Representation:

The People’s Republic of China assumed China’s
representation in the World Bank on May 15, 1980.

Capital Subscription:

China holds 4,480 million shares or 2.85 percent of the total
authorized capital of the IBRD. Currently, China is fully
subscribed.

Technical Assistance:

A technical assistance loan to the People's Bank of China to
enhance the central bank’s supervision, research, and clearing
capabilities was approved in FY1993. A second technical
assistance project, approved in the same year, is financing
reform-supportive studies and economic research, the
strengthening of core agencies responsible for macroeconomic
management and local training institutions, and preinvestment
support. Technical assistance for economic law reform was
approved in FY1995. Fiscal technical assistance, also approved
in FY1995, supported the implementation of a broad range of

59
public sector reforms. Assistance in bond market development
has also been provided. In FY1999, technical assistance
projects were approved for reform of accounting, pension and
enterprise systems. Further technical assistance support for
economic research and preinvestment was also provided in
FY1999. A supplemental loan for financial sector technical
assistance was approved in FY2001. The Economic Reform
Implementation project, a technical cooperation credit, was
approved in FY2006. A large program of technical assistance is
currently financed by trust funds from within and outside the
Bank, covering economic and financial sector reform,
statistical reform, poverty issues, social sectors, debt
management, and social security.
Resident Mission:

International Finance
Corporation (IFC):

A resident IBRD office in Beijing has been in operation since
October 1985. In October 1997, responsibility for managing
the Bank’s total program for China was decentralized to the
Beijing office.

As of May 31, 2006, IFC had outstanding commitments for
financing 76 projects in China. For these projects IFC has
provided US$1,457 million: US$1,283 million for IFC’s own
account and US$174 million for the account of participating
banks. A resident IFC office in Beijing has been in operation
since 1992. In July 2000, a joint IFC/World Bank regional
office for private sector development was established in Hong
Kong SAR, with management of this program decentralized to
that office.
IFC's priorities in China include: supporting private sector
development in interior provinces; expanding the presence of
private enterprises in infrastructure, social services, and
environmental technology sectors; and improving the business
environment, particularly as it relates to financial markets,
private participation in infrastructure, and small and medium
enterprises. IFC's interventions in China focus on completing
standard-setting model transactions for private sector
investments, with a view of promoting innovation, creating
demonstration effects and improving corporate practices. IFC's
priorities in China include: improving the business
environment and strengthening regulatory capacity mainly
through the IFC's technical assistance facility PEP-China;
expanding access to markets by supporting the entry of private

60
enterprises in new sectors and through projects in agribusiness
and forestry; upgrading corporate practices in the area of
corporate governance, environmental and social impacts;
expanding access to finance and financial sector development
by supporting SME lending and the growth of private financial
institutions; enhancing environmental sustainability and energy
efficiency; promoting private participation in infrastructure;
and helping to address regional imbalances.

ANNEX VI: CHINA—RELATIONS WITH THE ASIAN DEVELOPMENT BANK
1.
The Asian Development Bank’s operation in the PRC focuses on a set of four
interrelated challenges: (i) promoting pro-poor inclusive economic growth; (ii) building an
enabling environment for the private sector and strengthening public sector governance;
(iii) fostering regional cooperation to help integrate the PRC into the global economy; and
(iv) promoting environmental sustainability.
2.
Since the PRC became a member of ADB in 1986, 114 public sector loans totaling
$16.2 billion and 498 technical assistance projects amounting to $256.8 million have been
approved as of end-December 2005. In addition, ADB has 17private sector loans totaling
$137.2 million in loan and $274.3 million in equity as of 31 December 2005.
3.
Infrastructure, urban development, environmental improvement and rural and
agriculture development will remain Government’s priority sectors identified for ADB
assistance. ADB lending will continue to focus on the central, western and northeastern
provinces.
4.
The Country Strategy and Program Update (2006–2008) has programmed a total loan
assistance of $4.5 billion for the period 2006–2008, amounting to an annual average lending
of about $1.5 billion. Of this, 47.6% is for the transport sector, 20.0% for the agriculture and
natural resources sector, 14.8% for the social infrastructure sector, 12.0% in the energy sector
and 5.6% for multi-sectors. About 85% of the loan projects are located in the central and
western provinces.
5.
The ADB’s lending program will continue to be supported by technical assistance.
The annual nonlending program amounts to around $11 million for the period 2006–2008.
TAs for operational support cover: (a) transport, (b) energy, (c) land management, (d) water
supply and wastewater treatment, (e) urban development, (f) education and health, and
(g) environment. TAs for policy impacts and knowledge-based products fall into the
following areas: (a) support for policy reform and deepening the impact of ADB lending
projects, (b) financial sector reform, (c) law and development, (d) fiscal reform, and
(e)support to education and health.
6.
Overall, China has demonstrated strong project implementation capability. The good
performance reflects the strong sense of project ownership among agencies involved in the
design, implementation, and management of projects, as well as the rigorous screening
process for development projects, particularly those proposed for external assistance. Loan
disbursement and contract award performance is good.

Statement by the IMF Staff Representative
July 31, 2006
1.
This statement contains information that has become available since the staff
report was circulated to the Executive Board on July 11, 2006. The thrust of the staff
appraisal remains valid.
2.
Economic growth accelerated in the second quarter of 2006. GDP grew by
11¼ percent (year-on-year), up from 10¼ percent in the first quarter, reflecting continued
high investment and rising net exports. Despite some tightening measures, investment growth
topped 30 percent (year-on-year) in the second quarter, while the trade surplus increased, as
growth in exports outpaced that of imports. Inflation in June was slightly higher at
1½ percent (year-on-year). With GDP growth in the first half of 2006 at about 11 percent,
there are upside risks to the current staff projection of a 10 percent GDP growth rate for the
year as a whole, as noted in the staff report (paragraph 13).
3.
Money and credit growth slowed modestly in June, but liquidity in the banking
system remains high. Broad money (M2) grew by about 18½ percent (year-on-year) in June,
down from 19 percent in May. Total loan growth also moderated to 14¼ percent (year-onyear) in June, from 15 percent in May. In an effort to further mop up the liquidity and curb
credit growth, the People's Bank of China on July 21 raised the required reserve ratio on bank
deposits by another 50 basis points (effective August 15), adding to the 50 basis point
increase in early July. Despite these recent steps, as noted in the staff report, a significant risk
remains that macroeconomic policies are not sufficiently tight to rein in lending and
investment growth.
4.
The renminbi/US$ rate remains tightly managed although its variability has
increased. In the past two weeks, the daily rate has generally traded below RMB 8 per U.S.
dollar with inter-day changes ranging from an appreciation of 0.14 percent to a depreciation
of 0.08 percent. Foreign exchange accumulation remains rapid with total reserves reaching
$941 billion in June reflecting a $122 billion accumulation in the first half of 2006.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
September 11, 2006

International Monetary Fund

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2006 Article IV Consultation with
the People's Republic of China
On July 31, 2006, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded
the Article IV consultation with the People's Republic of China.1
Background

China’s output growth continues to be strong. Based on the revised official data, GDP growth
in 2005 reached 10 percent, roughly the same as in the previous year. Indicators for the major
components of demand suggest that output growth could have been much higher than
officially estimated in 2005. Economic activity maintained its momentum in the first quarter
of 2006, with further evidence of acceleration in investment. GDP grew by 10¼ percent
(year-on-year) in the first quarter. Total nominal fixed investment increased from
25.7 percent in 2005 to 29.8 percent in the fist half of 2006. Net exports continued to be
strong, although the pace of import growth has accelerated. Indicators also suggest that
consumption remained robust. Despite strong growth, inflation remains subdued. After
peaking at 5¼ percent (year-on-year) in mid-2004, headline CPI inflation fell to 1¾ percent
in 2005 and 1½ percent by May 2006, largely driven by a significant moderation of food
price inflation.

1

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On return
to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the Executive
Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the Board,
summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the country's
authorities. This PIN summarizes the views of the Executive Board as expressed during the Executive
Board discussion based on the staff report.

2
The external position strengthened substantially in 2005. The trade surplus was the main
driver, surging to $135 billion in 2005 compared to $59 billion in 2004. Export growth was
robust given the strong world demand and China’s increasing role in processing trade.
The overall slowdown in import growth resulted in a large increase in the current account
surplus in 2005 to over 7 percent of GDP, up from 3½ percent in 2004. This slowdown
largely reflected a switch away from imports toward domestically produced inputs, a
moderation in the investment demand for machineries, and some reduction in raw material
inventories. The trade surplus continues to strengthen in 2006, with a surplus through May
2006 of $47 billion, significantly higher than the $30 billion recorded for same period last
year. Despite a pickup in import growth driven mostly by primary products and machinery,
export growth remains strong. Reserves increased by $208 billion in 2005, broadly in line
with reserves accumulation in 2004, and by a further $76 billion in 2006, bringing the level at
end-April to about $895 billion. Net FDI inflows reached $68 billion in 2005 compared to
$53 billion in 2004. Over the period, non-FDI capital flows sharply reversed to an outflow of
$22 billion in 2005 (including errors and omissions), compared to an inflow of $85 billion in
2004.
Less than full sterilization of foreign exchange reserve accumulation has left substantial
liquidity in the banking system, and credit growth appears to be accelerating. While broad
money (M2) has accelerated since mid-2005, reaching 19 percent annual growth through
May 2006 (compared to PBC’s annual target of 16 percent growth), credit growth averaging
around 13½ percent in 2005, remained relatively subdued, reflecting more cautious lending
by the large state-owned banks undergoing restructuring and “moral suasion” on the part of
the PBC. However, credit growth has since risen to 16 percent in May 2006 (compared to the
PBC’s annual target of 12 percent). In response, the PBC increased the benchmark lending
rate modestly in May (by 27 basis points), the second such increase in 10 years and
announced that the reserve requirement ratio of all banks except the rural credit co-operatives
will be raised by 0.5 percentage point to 8 percent on July 5 2006. Short-term interest rates
have risen somewhat since early November, as the People’s Bank of China (PBC) stepped up
open-market operations, but they remain well below the 2½–3 percent levels of 2004.
Staff projects GDP growth to remain around 10 percent in 2006. This forecast assumes that
appropriate macroeconomic policies will be in place to constrain investment growth—unless
these policy actions are taken, GDP growth could easily exceed the 10 percent forecast.
Export growth is expected to remain strong, but to moderate from its 2005 pace. Import
growth, although higher than in 2005, would remain subdued as investment and export
growth slows. Consumption growth is expected to remain relatively strong, as rural incomes
continue to rise and consumer credit facilities expand. The export slowdown and higher
import growth should keep the external current account from growing further relative to GDP
in 2006. However the outturn in the first few months of 2006 points to the possibility that
export growth may not slow as much as generally expected, which could result in a further
widening of the annual current account surplus. Inflation is expected to remain below
2 percent in 2006, as falling prices in sectors with overcapacity will likely be offset by a
modest rise in services inflation, as well as some upward adjustments in certain administered
prices. With price declines confined to certain sectors, the risk of generalized deflation in the
economy at present appears small. In the near term, a significant risk remains that

3
macroeconomic policies will not be sufficiently tight to contain investment growth.
In particular, there is a need for monetary policy to prevent a surge in credit growth from
tipping off a boom-bust cycle and an associated rise in banks’ nonperforming loans.
Growing protectionist sentiments in China’s major markets, especially the United States and
the EU, also present a major risk. Moreover, a disorderly unwinding of global imbalances
would threaten China’s growth, as economic activity in partner countries would likely suffer
lingering adverse effects. Although less immediate, avian flu remains a threat.
China has continued to implement a broad range of structural reforms. In the banking sector,
progress has been made in strengthening supervision and improving bank operations,
especially in the three large state-owned commercial banks, which have been recapitalized.
State-owned enterprises have become more market oriented and corporate and management
restructuring has continued. A number of steps also have been taken in line with China’s
WTO commitments, including further tariff reductions that lowered the unweighted average
tariff rate by half a percentage point to 10 percent in 2005.
Executive Board Assessment

Executive Directors commended the authorities for sustaining high economic growth and
noted that China’s prospects for the future remain favorable, provided that the risks and
challenges faced by the country are addressed. They broadly endorsed the government’s
medium-term economic reform strategy, particularly the need to rebalance the economy
away from heavy dependence on investment and exports for growth towards consumption.
Directors agreed that liquidity in the banking system is abundant and noted that, in light of
this, a further pick-up in the already high rate of credit and investment growth remains a
near-term risk. While the monetary policy actions taken so far were welcomed, it was
emphasized that additional steps will likely be needed. Directors viewed that the authorities
should further step up reliance on open market operations to drain liquidity from the banking
system, and observed that this may need to be supplemented by other monetary policy
measures, such as additional hikes in benchmark interest rates and/or the reserve requirement
ratio.
Directors emphasized the importance of improving the effectiveness of monetary policy.
Directors noted that the authorities also use moral suasion and administrative steps to restrain
credit and investment growth. While recognizing that there might be need for such measures,
a number of Directors noted that they made it difficult for banks to operate fully on a
commercial basis. Directors stressed that greater exchange rate flexibility is needed to enable
the PBC to use its monetary policy instruments more effectively. Some Directors also viewed
the PBC’s lack of sufficient discretion in setting interest rates as an impediment to timely and
effective policy action.
Many Directors found it appropriate for China to continue to allow greater flexibility in its
exchange rate in a gradual and controlled manner. They shared the authorities’ concern that
accelerating exchange rate flexibility could have an adverse impact on macroeconomic
stability. Some of these Directors also viewed that exchange rate adjustment alone would
have a limited impact on external balances. A number of other Directors, however, stressed

4
that the flexibility afforded by the current exchange rate system should be used more
extensively. These Directors noted that the current strength of the Chinese economy provides
a favorable context for adjustment and should serve to alleviate the authorities’ concerns
about the potential adverse economic effects. Directors noted that greater exchange rate
flexibility, along with other policy changes and reforms in China, will aid in rebalancing the
economy over the medium term, and will contribute to the orderly resolution of the global
current account imbalance, in conjunction with concerted policy efforts by other key
economies.
Directors noted that the last few years of fiscal consolidation have created the space for a
needed step-up in social spending, which would serve to help rebalance growth towards
consumption, as well. In this regard, they considered the initiatives in the 2006 budget to
raise social spending to be appropriate from a near-term perspective. Directors supported the
priority given by the authorities to developing comprehensive plans to reform the provision
of key social services, such as health care, education, and pensions, and to improving
implementation capacity, including the reforms entrained in the budget process (the revised
budget classification, chart of accounts, and extension of the treasury single account).
They noted that such steps will be needed before embarking on large scale increases in
spending in these areas. Directors also emphasized the importance of reforms in center-local
fiscal relations, and urged the authorities to ensure all local governments have adequate
resources to meet their spending responsibilities.
Directors commended the progress achieved in bank reform. They noted that improving
intermediation of China’s large private savings will be critical to rebalancing economic
growth over the medium term. In this regard, they welcomed the authorities’ efforts to further
improve the banks’ commercial orientation, internal controls, and governance, and stressed
the need for the early adoption of a formal reform plan for the Agricultural Bank of China
(ABC). More generally, Directors recommended the continued scaling-back, and eventual
elimination, of government involvement in the management and business operations of the
banks. They urged a further strengthening of banking supervision, in particular with regard to
assessing banks’ foreign exchange and credit risks, and noted that closer monitoring of the
flow of new non-performing loans is also essential to the early detection of potential
problems.
Directors also welcomed the steps taken to accelerate the development of China’s capital
markets. They recognized the progress realized in reviving the equity markets, the strong
growth in the short-term corporate bills market, and the launching of the interbank market for
asset-backed securities, as important steps. While noting that some impediments in the
corporate bond market had been addressed by the new Securities Act, Directors observed that
allowing bonds to be issued based on a disclosure-based system, while removing the cap on
corporate bond interest rates and streamlining regulatory responsibilities, will be key steps to
accelerating the development of this market. In this context, they welcomed the authorities’
agreement in principle to conduct an Financial Sector Assessment Program and encouraged
them to set an early date for participation. Such an exercise would contribute to a stocktaking
of recent progress in financial sector reforms and to identifying priorities for further reforms.

5
Directors commended the authorities for setting up a task force to look into the modalities for
greater dividend payments to the government by the state-owned enterprises, and emphasized
that such dividend payments should be made to the budget. Directors considered that this
policy, by curbing the sharp rise in investment in some sectors and by providing additional
resources to fund reforms in social services, will be an important element of the strategy to
rebalance growth.
Directors welcomed improvements in economic statistics, including in the national income
accounts and the international investment position. Looking ahead, they viewed the
publication of annual and quarterly real GDP on an expenditure basis and further
improvements in some aspects of balance of payments statistics as key priorities, and urged
the authorities to continue to make use of the IMF’s technical assistance in these areas.
Directors welcomed China’s provision of financial support and debt relief to many lowincome countries. Directors encouraged the authorities to share information on these
activities with the IMF, to participate fully in the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries initiatives,
and to make their lending activities consistent with the low-income country debt
sustainability framework.
Public Information Notices (PINs) form part of the IMF's efforts to promote transparency of the IMF's
views and analysis of economic developments and policies. With the consent of the country
(or countries) concerned, PINs are issued after Executive Board discussions of Article IV consultations
with member countries, of its surveillance of developments at the regional level, of post-program
monitoring, and of ex post assessments of member countries with longer-term program engagements.
PINs are also issued after Executive Board discussions of general policy matters, unless otherwise
decided by the Executive Board in a particular case.
