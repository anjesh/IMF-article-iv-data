EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
The 2008 Article IV consultation discussions with Yemen focused on the appropriate policy
response to high inflation and mounting fiscal and external vulnerabilities.
Background
Recent economic performance has been mixed. Oil production continues to decline, and oil
reserves are expected to be depleted in 10–12 years. Non-oil sector growth is estimated at
about 5.3 percent in 2007 and 4.8 percent in 2008. Inflation has been volatile, reflecting the
surge in international commodity prices and local drought. High oil prices buffered
government revenue and exports in 2007 and the first half of 2008, but pressures are quickly
mounting on public finances and the balance of payments as oil prices decline.
Authorities’ views
•

Efforts are being made to compress expenditures in 2008 so as to avoid upward
pressure on inflation and reduce the deficit. The authorities remain committed to
fiscal consolidation, including elimination of fuel subsidies, a smaller wage bill, and
boosting non-oil revenues. Social stability concerns are key to the pace of reform.

•

Monetary policy has sought to mitigate inflation through exchange rate stability and
controlling domestic liquidity. A stable rial has brought benefits, but there are limits
given balance of payments pressures and the need to minimize reserve losses.

•

Financial intermediation is deepening. Banks’ balance sheets continue to improve, but
some weaknesses remain. Further strengthening the banking sector is a priority.

Staff recommendations
•

The fuel subsidy system should be phased out in combination with an increase in, and
better targeting of, social welfare transfers. The civil service wage bill should be
reduced. Action is needed on overdue non-oil revenue reforms.

•

Exchange rate stability should be maintained for the short term to dampen inflation,
but monetary policy must focus more on price stability going forward. There is no
clear evidence of significant exchange rate misalignment, but flexibility will be
needed in coming years, given falling oil prices and dwindling oil reserves.

•

Financial sector reform and modernization are essential to deepening financial
intermediation and growth prospects. Further reform of the investment environment is
key to fostering alternative sources of growth as oil output declines.

I. INTRODUCTION
1.
Yemen is one of the poorest countries in the Middle East. 1 An estimated
35 percent of the population lives below the poverty line. Oil reserves are expected to be
depleted in about 10–12 years. Yemen has few other natural resources and is also facing
depletion of its groundwater. These challenges are compounded by an expanding population,
poor infrastructure, weak institutional capacity, a fragile security situation, and the
widespread use of qat—a mild narcotic accounting for over one–third of agricultural
production and about a quarter of total water resource use.
2.
Economic reforms slowed after the 1990s, and urgently need to be reinvigorated.
Although a number of reform initiatives emerged in recent years—including civil service
and public financial management (PFM) reforms, a major adjustment to fuel subsidies
in 2005, a new general sales tax (GST), an anticorruption drive, and improvements to the
social safety net—most have been only partially implemented and with significant delays.
Fund advice on preparing for the transition to a non-oil economy has had limited traction,
particularly in the context of record world oil prices and increasing political and security
constraints. However, recent developments—the sharp decline in oil output in 2007 and the
even sharper decline in oil prices in late 2008—are bringing a new sense of urgency to the
debate on economic reform.
II. RECENT ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS

activity has grown at a reasonable rate but
is likely to have slowed moderately in 2008.
Inflation has been a key concern. Pressures
related to the global slowdown and the
falling price of oil began to materialize in
late 2008.

13.1 percent decline in oil output. 2 Overall growth should pick up in 2008, with
somewhat lower non-oil growth of 4.8 percent compensated for by a smaller decline
in oil output.
•

Core inflation (excluding qat) rose to 27 percent by May 2008—reflecting the
surge in global commodity prices. Inflation has since declined to about 18 percent in
October. Some spillover to nonfood items may have emerged. Inflation excluding qat
and food reached a record 18 percent by June—mainly due to the cost of services,
clothing, housing, and fuels (Box 1).

•

A sizeable fiscal deficit emerged in 2007, and another is likely for 2008. A sharp
decline in oil production, coupled with inflexible government expenditure, led to an
overall fiscal deficit of 5.8 percent in 2007. For 2008, a deficit of around 5–6 percent
of GDP is possible in the wake of the recent drop in international oil prices, continued
rigid expenditures, and limited non-oil revenue improvements.

•

Monetary policy in 2008 focused on exchange rate stability and controlling
excess liquidity in the domestic banking system. The rial has remained steady
against the U.S. dollar since mid–2007, helping to mitigate imported inflation. In real
effective terms, the rial appreciated by 9.5 percent in the 12 months to October. The
Central Bank of Yemen (CBY) used its full allowance of Treasury bills to absorb

The Central Statistics Office (CSO) recently revised and rebased national accounts series with the help of a
technical expert from the United Nations Economic and Social Commission for Western Asia (ESCWA). The
exercise is an important step forward in establishing a more timely and credible set of data on GDP. However,
technical problems remain and work will continue with the objective of producing a revised and consistent data
set by the end of 2008. The staff and authorities agreed to use the established national accounts series for the
purpose of this report.

Box 1. Inflation Developments in Yemen and the Policy Response
Inflation developments: Inflation in Yemen
has been extremely volatile in the past year.
35
During January–July 2008, 12-month core
30
inflation (i.e., excluding qat)
averaged 19 percent. Food prices have been
25
the main impetus, with food inflation
20
averaging 22 percent during the first two
quarters of 2008—in line with the most
15
vulnerable net food importing countries in the
10
region. While non-tradables have not
5
generally been a major source of inflation—
due at least in part to administered domestic
0
fuel prices—some of the recent push from
commodity prices seems to be feeding into
other components of the CPI (such as housing and
related items). Though the worst of the food crisis
appears to be over, recent developments
underscored Yemen’s vulnerability to commodity
shocks.

Social and macroeconomic impact: The surge
in commodity prices is likely to have aggravated
poverty, particularly for small farmers and the
landless. Increasing poverty and food prices
also appear to have contributed to growing social
tensions. Record international fuel prices for the first half of 2008 also raised the fuel subsidy bill and added
to the 2008 government fiscal deficit.

bank has meanwhile maintained a prudent monetary policy and suspended the practice of steadily
depreciating the rial in favor of exchange rate stability in order to mitigate the extent of imported inflation.

III. POLICY DISCUSSIONS
4.
Discussions focused on (i) risks to the outlook from the global slowdown and the
dramatic drop in oil prices; (ii) appropriate fiscal and monetary policies to keep inflation on a
downward path and address the recent and prospective deterioration in public finances; and
(iii) macroeconomic and structural reforms to ensure fiscal and external sustainability.
A. Outlook and Risks
5.
Yemen remains relatively insulated from the financial side of the current world
economic crisis (Box 2). Yemeni banks have relatively low exposure to private foreign
lending, which centers around trade flows. Portfolio investment is quite limited, given the
absence of a domestic stock market or commercial credit market. Yemen’s main foreign
asset—the CBY’s reserves—are highly liquid and kept predominantly in the form of deposits
in international banks. While Yemen could suffer from a decline in external financing (either
through lower remittances, FDI, or official financing flows), these risks have yet to
materialize, and would move more slowly than financial contagion.
6.
Yemen remains vulnerable to commodity shocks and the effects of slower
regional and world economic activity. Although government revenue and the balance of
payments benefited from the high price of oil during the first half of 2008, the economy
suffered from higher imported food and input prices. With the global slowdown and sharp
decline in crude oil and other commodity prices, these risks have essentially reversed.
Pressures expected to materialize over the medium term with declining oil production have
become near-term considerations. Without substantial expenditure and revenue reforms, the
fiscal deficit will become increasingly difficult to finance, and balance of payments pressures
will mount (notwithstanding the CBY’s substantial reserve cushion). Slower regional growth
is also projected to bring lower levels of non-oil foreign investment than might have been
expected (contributing to lower growth), as well as lower inward remittances from expatriate
Yemeni workers in the Gulf and elsewhere.
B. Policies for 2008–09: Reducing Inflation, Containing the Deficit
7.
The authorities recognized the need to further reduce inflation and address
emerging imbalances. Recent data suggest that the worst of the turbulence in international
food prices has passed. Price pressures in Yemen should continue to ease with lower world
commodity prices (and falling transport costs). Nevertheless, the authorities agreed additional
efforts would be necessary to bring twelve-month inflation to 15 percent or less by end-year.
The authorities also concurred that the risks to public finances and external sustainability had
increased considerably since the end of the oil-price boom and that fiscal and monetary
policy would need to be carefully coordinated to meet this challenge.

10
Box 2. Impact of the Global Financial Crisis on Yemen
The risk of financial contagion from the global economic turbulence appears low. Yemen is not closely
integrated with international financial and capital markets. The small size of the domestic banking system and
low level of financial intermediation would also contain the direct impact, even if access to bank credit is
restricted. Liquidity risk to the foreign exchange reserves of CBY also appears low, as these assets are mainly in
the form of deposits at large commercial banks in Europe. The CBY increased foreign exchange auctions in
September to maintain a stable exchange rate and calm market jitters about the availability of foreign exchange,
but no additional action has yet been necessary.
Yemen does remain vulnerable to a real shock through lower oil prices. Oil exports account for a large
share of government revenue and the bulk of foreign exchange receipts. The fiscal impact could be softened by
a corresponding decline in fuel subsides (even with unchanged domestic fuel prices). A further drop in
international oil prices would increase pressure on Yemen’s fiscal and external accounts. For each $10/bbl
decline, the overall fiscal balance and current account would deteriorate by almost 1 percentage point of GDP.
Pressure on the external accounts may be partly alleviated if international commodity prices continue to decline.

Softer growth and financial distress in partner countries may also negatively impact Yemen’s access to
external financial resources—namely remittances, foreign direct investment (FDI) and concessional donor
financing. While the likelihood or potential magnitude of these secondary effects are difficult to gauge
(especially given data limitations in Yemen), stress tests prepared by staff suggest that:
•

A 50 percent decline in non-oil FDI would likely soften growth, and reduce import demand and the
current account deficit (each by around 0.5 percent of GDP).

•

A 50 percent fall in remittances could widen the current account deficit by over 0.5 percent of GDP,
notwithstanding some import compression, and marginally lower real GDP growth.

•

Fifty percent lower donor disbursements would marginally widen the overall fiscal deficit and, assuming
capital spending is maintained to avoid a negative impact on growth, domestic debt would increase by
1.2 percent of GDP.

Absent alternative financing, each of these scenarios could result in a loss of foreign exchange reserves of up to
½ a month of imports. Under a combined loss of non-oil FDI, remittances, and donor financing, the fiscal
and current account deficits would deteriorate by 1–1½ percent of GDP, public sector domestic debt would rise
by around 2½–3 percent of GDP, and international reserves would drop by one month of imports.

11

Fiscal policy
8.
The authorities indicated that they would seek to compress spending during the
remainder of 2008 to reduce upward pressure on prices. They noted that some fuel
subsidies were reduced in August, when pressures began to emerge. 3 Spending under the
supplementary budget was largely constrained to the additional cost of the fuel subsidy, but
also covered the ad hoc increase in wages, pensions, and social welfare transfers granted in
March. Additional compression of some spending commitments under the original budget
may be possible.
9.
The authorities concurred that the risks to public finances will be more
pronounced in 2009. Based on an oil price of $55 per barrel, the approved government
budget implies an overall deficit of about 8.6 percent of GDP—the highest since the oil price
shock of 1998. Staff and the authorities agreed that a deficit of this magnitude would be
difficult to finance and that additional actions would be necessary to preserve the credibility
of public finances. With a view to keeping the overall deficit below 6 percent of GDP
(consistent with domestic financing of 4.5 percent of GDP 4 ), the staff offered a fiscal
scenario based on a set of adjustment measures and the most recent WEO oil price ($54.25
per barrel). Most significant among the adjustment measures were (i) a reduction in fuel
subsidies by mid-year; (ii) a nominal freeze on the public sector wage bill; 5 and (iii) overdue
actions to boost tax revenues. The staff also urged the authorities to follow up on earlier
pledges of donor support, and to seek concessional external financing, where possible.
Monetary and exchange rate policy
10.
Given the priority of reducing inflation, the CBY indicated it would continue to
focus on exchange rate stability in the short term. In addition to alleviating imported
inflation, stability vis-à-vis the U.S. dollar appears to have helped confidence in the rial and
lowered dollarization. The mission noted that the monetary stance and focus on exchange
rate stability had been broadly appropriate, but that there remained some risk of inflation
becoming entrenched. The CBY indicated it would remain vigilant in mopping up excess
3

In August 2008, the authorities raised the price of diesel for sales to selected industries (mainly concrete and
steel companies). However, this accounts for only a small portion of subsidized domestic consumption.

4

Most domestic financing is through Treasury bills, with the remainder in the form of unsecuritized loans.
Domestic debt is relatively short-term and expensive (3, 6, and 12 months maturities, with an average interest
rate of about 16 percent). The scope for domestic financing of the 2009 budget deficit thus appears limited.

5

Public sector wages and salaries in the official budget are lower than that proposed by staff because the
authorities used the 2007 budget as a base and did not take into account the one-off increase granted in March
2008 or the annual Ramadan bonus.

liquidity in the banking system. Given that it has already exhausted its yearly allowance of
Treasury bills, the CBY would continue to issue CDs and conduct further foreign exchange
auctions—even at the cost of international reserves. The CBY also indicated that other
options, such as increasing the benchmark deposit rate, increasing reserve requirements, or
using Islamic financial instruments, 6 were also under discussion.
11.
While there is no evidence of current misalignment, the rial is probably
moderately overvalued from a medium-term perspective. The prospective decline in oil
production over the next 10–12 years suggests that the real exchange rate will need to decline
over the medium term in order to render the economy more competitive and thereby generate
non-oil export growth for Yemen. The current policy of maintaining broad stability for the
rial seems appropriate for the short term given the need to keep inflation down. If fiscal
consolidation proceeds as envisioned and inflation continues to fall, greater flexibility in the
rial should be considered as the economy and the fiscal accounts adjust to lower oil revenue.
(Box 3).
C. Macroeconomic Policies for the Medium Term
12.
Yemen’s medium-term outlook remains dominated by the expected depletion of
oil reserves. The latest information
Yemen: Medium-Term Projections for Total Hydrocarbon Output by Crude Oil and LNG,
2008–21 (million barrels per year)
suggests that total recoverable oil (proven 180
Crude Oil Output
LNG Output
160
reserves plus a portion of probable and
140
possible reserves) is about 1.1 billion
barrels. Assuming oil production declines 120
gradually (an average annual drop of about 100
80
5 percent per year), oil reserves will be
exhausted by 2021. Starting in 2009, LNG 60
40
production will help alleviate the impact
20
on government revenue and exports, but
0
will not make up for the loss of crude oil.

13.
There was broad consensus among government agencies that current policies are
not sustainable. The staff presented a scenario of unchanged macroeconomic policies to
highlight the risks of inaction. Under this scenario, external financing and non-oil growth
would be lower. The fiscal deficit would expand quickly to 15 percent of GDP by 2012;
reserve cover would decline as the external current account deficit widened—raising the risk
of a sharp adjustment in the exchange rate. Assuming that domestic and external financing
gaps could be filled (which is doubtful given the limited appetite for domestic debt, Yemen’s
lack of access to international capital markets, and tighter conditions for official financing),
6

The CBY has formally requested technical assistance from the IMF on how to design and make operational
financial instruments compliant with Shari’a law.

13
public debt would rise from 38 percent of GDP in 2008 to over 65 percent in the medium
term.
14.
The authorities acknowledged the need for a comprehensive adjustment to fiscal
policy to ensure medium-term stability. They agreed that the centerpiece of this adjustment
lies in addressing the two largest components of current expenditure—the fuel subsidy and
the public sector wage bill, which together account for about 50 percent of total spending.
Staff prepared an adjustment scenario (Tables 1–6) to illustrate the extent and magnitude of
actions necessary to maintain macroeconomic stability and prevent debt distress. The
exercise was guided by a debt sustainability analysis (DSA) geared around keeping the
public debt-to-GDP ratio below 50 percent over the medium and long term.
15.
Even with a front-loaded adjustment to fuel subsidies in 2009, the non-oil
primary deficit 7 would need to adjust by an average of 2 percent of GDP per year in the
medium term and by about 0.5 percent of GDP per year thereafter. Key measures in this
adjustment process would include (i) gradually eliminating fuel subsidies in 2009–11,
accompanied by increased (and better targeted) social welfare transfers; (ii) reducing the civil
service wage bill by about 2 percentage points of GDP by 2013; (iii) implementing fully the
GST in 2009, and increasing the rate from 5 percent to 10 percent in 2011, and to 12 percent
in 2014; and (iv) streamlining the income tax through simultaneously lowering the rate from
35 percent to 20 percent while eliminating all exemptions in the customs, income tax, and
investment laws. These measures would also need to be underpinned by more rapid progress
on PFM reform to ensure tighter commitment control and careful debt management. 8
16.
Staff emphasized the risk of debt distress illustrated in the DSA. Staff
highlighted that, even with full implementation of the envisioned reform agenda, one debt
indicator (PV of debt-to-exports) violates the sustainability threshold over the long term.
Other debt indicators are breached under the sensitivity analysis. Given Yemen’s
vulnerability to external shocks, low institutional capacity, and the downside risks associated
with implementing the reform agenda, Yemen remains at a high risk of debt distress.

7

The non-oil primary deficit declines by 13 percentage points of GDP in 2009 under the staff’s adjustment
scenario. Of this, 10 percentage points relate to the change in the fuel subsidy bill, of which about 8 percentage
points stem from the change in the international oil price versus the administered domestic price.

8

The full and effective implementation of the Accounting and Financial Management Information System
(AFMIS) is a key element in advancing the PFM agenda. Other important elements include the full transition to
budget accounting in line with GFSM 2001, and the introduction of a Treasury system.

14
Box 3. Assessment of the Exchange Rate Level
There is no evidence to suggest that the exchange rate is currently misaligned, but it seems likely that the real
exchange rate will need to depreciate over the medium term.

The current account balance net of imports related to

3 percent of GDP in 2007, allowing for a further
buildup in central bank reserves. With the recent
decline in oil prices, monthly foreign exchange
auctions by the central bank have increased in size,
suggesting that downward pressure on the rial will
resume.

Over the past ten years Yemen’s real effective
exchange rate (REER) has appreciated—consistent
with movements in the price of oil—while the
current account has generally been in surplus.
In 2007, the REER appreciated (on average) by
about 3 percent compared to 2006—mainly due to
inflation, as the nominal value of the rial was steady
vis-à-vis the U.S. dollar.

Estimates obtained using the CGER methodology
are mixed (and thus merely indicative) owing to
data weaknesses and other shortcomings. The
equilibrium real effective exchange rate (EREER)
approach does not yield evidence of misalignment,
and predicts a moderate depreciation of the EREER
in the medium term. The macroeconomic balance
(MB) approach shows some undervaluation in 2007,
and predicts a more marked medium-term
depreciation.

17.
On the DSA, the authorities highlighted that, for now, the debt-to-GDP ratio remains
relatively low, and that a public debt law with ceilings for domestic, external, and overall
public debt is currently under discussion. Staff noted these points, but emphasized the recent
deterioration in key macroeconomic aggregates, the forward-looking nature of the
macroeconomic framework and the DSA, as well as the recent increase in risks. The staff
urged the authorities to consider an average increase in domestic fuel prices of 65 percent by
mid-2009 to help keep the budget deficit below 6 percent of GDP.
18.
The authorities were particularly conscious of the need to boost non-oil
revenues, but implementation of key reforms remains in flux. The long-delayed GST was
implemented in 2007, but as a concession to the powerful business community, was applied

16
to a relatively narrow segment of taxpayers. 9 Full implementation is planned for early 2009.
The ongoing income tax simplification is moving ahead but has not been aligned with
the 2009 budget. The required package of income tax rate reductions and elimination of
exemptions is at some risk, as revisions to the income tax, customs, and investment laws
were submitted separately to parliament. Staff emphasized that action on non-oil revenues
was critical to addressing the looming budget shortfall in 2009 and beyond.
19.
Monetary and exchange rate policy will have to adjust to shifting fundamentals.
The external current account pressures expected in 2009 are unlikely to diminish. Steady
progress in fiscal consolidation should provide some relief and help curb inflation. However,
staff believe that Yemen’s real effective exchange rate will have to depreciate over the
medium term in line with its equilibrium. The prospective decline in oil output may bring
downward pressure on the exchange rate—which could lead to a rapid and excessive
depletion of the central bank’s foreign exchange reserves and necessitate a depreciation of
the nominal exchange rate. Minimizing the inflationary impact of a depreciation of the rial,
however, will require steady fiscal consolidation, structural reforms that enable markets to
adjust quickly to changes in relative prices, sound debt management, and an effective
monetary framework focused on price stability.
D. Promoting Sustained Non-Hydrocarbon Growth
20.
New sources of growth will need to be developed to ameliorate the expected
decline in hydrocarbon output. Investment in infrastructure will be vital, and the authorities
have also focused on creating an environment conducive to private sector investment. Yemen
has launched a new one-stop shop for investors in the past year, and has made it easier to
obtain municipal licenses and to register with the chamber of commerce and tax office. Other
reforms include a new procurement law, the establishment of an active anticorruption
authority, and a review of labor and company laws. Yemen’s ranking on the World Bank’s
Doing Business report jumped from 113 in 2008 to 98 in 2009.
21.
The authorities concurred that a sound and vibrant financial system will be
essential to non-oil economic growth. They noted a range of financial sector reforms
initiated or implemented over the past year, including (i) passage of a deposit insurance law
and establishment of a deposit insurance corporation; (ii) amendments to the 1994 Islamic
Banking Law (submitted to parliament) to eliminate limits on foreign ownership and allow
commercial banks to open an Islamic branch; and (iii) a microfinance law, expected to be
passed by parliament in 2009. Further work needs to be done to establish a credit registry,

9

The GST was implemented in February 2007 at a rate of 5 percent (compared to the recommended 10 percent)
and with only partial coverage (in practice, it applies only to importers and manufacturers, and traders are
subject to administrative assessment of their liabilities).

17
liberalize interest rates, 10 establish an active interbank market, and address the weaknesses in
contract enforcement that have encouraged banks to focus their lending on a relatively small
number of well-known clients. Enforcing existing prudential standards also remains critical
to further reducing NPLs. The authorities expressed some interest in an update to the 2000
FSAP but have yet to make a formal request.
22.
The authorities continue to pursue closer ties with the region and the world
economy. Working party discussions on Yemen’s accession to the WTO have been in train
since 2004. Bilateral negotiations on goods and services have been concluded with China and
are ongoing with Australia, Canada, the EC, Japan, Korea, and the U.S. Yemen continues to
pursue membership in the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC)—primarily through the
Yemeni-Gulf Technical Committee. In mid-2008, GCC members tasked the Secretary
General to conduct an integrated study on the prospects for Yemen's accession into the bloc.
IV. OTHER ISSUES
23.
The quality and timeliness of Yemen’s economic data remain a concern. There
have been a number of improvements to the provision of monetary data in the past year,
although data on financial sector indicators are typically available only during missions.
Balance of payments data are also weak and suffer from long lags, making timely
assessments of the supply and demand for foreign exchange difficult. Provision of fiscal data
is improving slowly, although the timeliness and consistency of the quarterly financial
bulletins could be improved. Additional technical assistance on shifting to GFSM 2001
should facilitate this process. National accounts and inflation data are, for the time being, in a
state of transition. A revised and rebased set of national accounts was formulated in
cooperation with an external expert in 2008, and is now being reviewed and finalized. A
similar overhaul of the CPI is underway, in consultation with a technical expert from
METAC. Similar efforts should be accorded to developing a PPI, to enhance the accuracy of
the national accounts.
24.
Yemen is working on establishing an anti-money laundering/combating the
financing of terrorism (AML/CFT) framework. An AML law was passed in 2003 but was
broadly considered inadequate. A new unified draft law covering both AML and CFT issues
is with parliament for approval.

10

The benchmark interest rate on deposits has been fixed at 13 percent for the last nine years. In the staff’s
view, the minimum interest rate on deposits has distorted market signals and outlived its usefulness. It was
originally intended to mobilize deposits in the mid-1990s, when inflation was high and exchange rate
depreciations frequent.

18
V. STAFF APPRAISAL
25.
Yemen faces serious short-term and medium-term risks to economic and
financial stability. These risks have been present for some time (and were expected to
intensify with the depletion of oil reserves) but have been masked by high oil prices in recent
years. The sharp drop in oil production in 2007 and the current fall in international oil prices
have brought these risks back to center stage, highlighting the need for early adjustment.
26.
Fiscal policy needs urgently to adapt to a changing environment. Even if oil
prices recover from current lows, the expected depletion of oil reserves will require a steady
reduction in the non-oil primary deficit to maintain economic and financial stability. The
agenda of key expenditure and revenue reforms discussed in successive Article IV missions
needs to be implemented without further delay. In this context, staff attach particular
importance to the following:
•

An increase in domestic fuel prices by an average of 65 percent as soon as feasible
in 2009, followed by further increases to align domestic and international prices
by 2012. The impact on the poor should be cushioned by parallel increases in, and
better targeting of, social welfare spending.

•

Holding the wage bill constant in nominal terms in 2009—preferably through
attrition, restructuring, and elimination of ghost workers rather than a wage freeze.
The wage bill should be reduced further over the medium-term, ideally to a level
equivalent to about 8 percent of GDP by 2013.

•

Implementing fully the GST in January 2009, followed by successive increases in
the GST rate in later years.

•

Implementing the tax simplification project by eliminating tax exemptions in the
customs, income tax, and investment laws in exchange for a reduction in the tax rate
from 35 percent to 20 percent, effective January 2009.

27.
Monetary policy was broadly appropriate in 2008, but will also need to respond
to increased risks. Fiscal consolidation will be a critical step in alleviating pressure on the
external accounts. However, given the expected decline in oil production (only partially
offset by the advent of LNG), the external current account is likely to remain in deficit
in 2009 and beyond. In this environment, maintaining the rial steady vis-à-vis the U.S. dollar
could come at the expense of central bank international reserves. While the CBY should
continue to intervene to reduce short-term volatility in the value of the rial, greater exchange
rate flexibility may become necessary to avoid a dramatic decline in international reserves.
The central bank should closely monitor monthly cash flows in this respect and, in the
context of lower inflation, be prepared to allow the rial to move in line with fundamental
shifts in the equilibrium exchange rate. While there is no evidence to suggest that the

19
exchange rate is currently misaligned, it appears likely that the real exchange rate will need
to depreciate over the medium term.
28.
The adjustment path outlined by staff is ambitious, but reflects the reality of
recent changes to the outlook and charts a course that should help to ensure
macroeconomic stability. The sharp and sustained reduction in oil prices, the likely
downturn in regional growth, and the downside risks to investment and external financing all
highlight the need for action on a long overdue agenda of reforms. Nonetheless, the staff
recognize that the outlook is subject to considerable risks. The need to provide humanitarian
relief (to address recent flooding in the south) and a desire to ensure social and political
stability may constrain budgetary reform. Insufficient progress on fiscal consolidation could
threaten the authorities’ inflation objectives, or potentially crowd out private sector credit,
with attendant risks to non-hydrocarbon growth. A corresponding increase in public debt and
loss of reserves could quickly erode fiscal and external sustainability. Moreover, the potential
for a sharper-than-expected decline in oil prices (or loss of other foreign financing) in a
rapidly changing global environment would compound these pressures, necessitating further
adjustment.
29.
As fiscal consolidation proceeds, the central bank should focus more closely on
price stability and establishing a more effective monetary framework. The staff notes
efforts to strengthen liquidity forecasting at the CBY and coordination with the MOF. To
enhance the role of monetary policy, the CBY should also consider such steps as (i) making a
public commitment to price stability; (ii) liberalizing interest rates to remove the current
distortion to the cost of capital in Yemen, facilitate an increase in private sector lending, and
(in the context of fiscal consolidation and lower inflation) reduce the high interest cost of
public debt; and (iii) developing a broader range of monetary policy instruments.
30.
Deepening financial intermediation remains critical for medium-term growth.
Recent initiatives by the CBY have concentrated on (i) raising banks’ minimum capital
requirements to ensure safety and soundness; (ii) introducing a deposit insurance scheme;
and (iii) seeking to level the playing field between conventional and Islamic banks by
adjusting reserve requirements and remuneration of reserves. More remains to be done.
Liberalizing interest rates, establishing a credit registry, and encouraging a domestic
interbank market would be critical next steps. Enforcement of existing prudential regulations
and standards will also be key—particularly given that NPLs remain high (albeit declining).
An update to the 2000 Financial Sector Assessment (FSAP) could be useful as a roadmap for
further financial sector reform.
31.
Data provision remains adequate for surveillance, but Yemen is in a transitional
phase in several areas. Long overdue work on the national accounts and prices is now
coming to fruition, but further TA is needed to ensure the provision of robust and credible
data. The transition to GFSM 2001 for the fiscal accounts has advanced but remains a work
in progress and could benefit from additional TA. Finally, improving the balance of

20
payments is now more essential than ever, given the need for a timely and accurate
assessment of foreign exchange flows.
32.
It is proposed that the next Article IV consultation discussions be held on the standard
12-month cycle.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND
REPUBLIC OF YEMEN
Joint World Bank/IMF Debt Sustainability Analysis
Prepared by the Staffs of the International Monetary Fund and
the International Development Association
Approved by Adam Bennett and David Marston (IMF)
and Carlos A. Primo Braga and Ritva Reinikka (IDA)
January 21, 2009
The Joint IMF-World Bank low-income country debt sustainability analysis (DSA)
undertaken here reconfirms last year’s assessment that Yemen is at a high risk of external
debt distress. Even under a baseline scenario that assumes considerable adjustment, the
present value (PV) of debt-to-exports ratio breaches the sustainability threshold. Additional
thresholds are breached under sensitivity tests. It will be critical for Yemen to maintain
sound policies consistent with a prudent borrowing strategy.
I. INTRODUCTION
1.
This joint Bank-Fund debt sustainability analysis (DSA) suggests that Yemen
remains at a high risk of (external) debt distress. Current debt ratios are relatively low
compared with the indicative thresholds for sustainability, but dwindling oil production over
the medium term presents significant challenges. With unchanged policies, debt would
quickly become unsustainable. Even under a baseline scenario that assumes comprehensive
fiscal and structural reforms, one of the debt thresholds (PV of debt-to-exports ratio) is
breached and two other indicators (PV of debt-to-GDP ratio and debt service-to-exports
ratio) approach their respective threshold levels. Standard DSA stress tests highlight that
external debt sustainability could be further weakened by adverse shocks, notably
depreciation of the exchange rate, lower export growth, and less favorable financing terms.
Strong fiscal and structural reforms, supported by concessional external financing, will thus
be essential to avoid debt distress.
2.
The Yemeni authorities largely agreed with the staff analysis, but expressed
some reservations about the “high risk” assessment given that current debt ratios are
low relative to the indicative thresholds. The staff emphasized the recent decline in
economic performance (as manifest in the fiscal and external current account deficits), the
forward-looking nature of the DSA, and the many risks to the macroeconomic framework
and debt indicators over the medium and long term. In addition to the high vulnerability to
adverse developments highlighted by the stress tests, the staff also underscored that the
baseline macroeconomic framework assumed an ambitious reform and policy adjustment

2
program, the achievement of which would require a serious and sustained level of
commitment and continued external support.
II. METHODOLOGY
3.
The DSA uses the debt sustainability framework for low-income countries. Debt
sustainability is assessed in relation to policy-dependent thresholds for external debt burden
indicators. According to the average Country Policy and Institutional Assessment index for
2007, Yemen is classified as a weak performer in terms of policies and institutions.1
4.
The DSA is based on the macroeconomic framework discussed with the authorities
during the 2008 IMF Article IV Consultations (IMF Country Report No.09/---). It assumes a
sustained, front-loaded fiscal adjustment based on expenditure and revenue reforms in
response to dwindling oil production. Beyond the medium term, it is assumed that the reform
process would continue and intensify before and after the exhaustion of oil reserves—
projected to occur around 2021. The outcome under this scenario is subjected to stress tests
to assess its vulnerability to less favorable developments in key economic variables,
including the macroeconomic consequences of maintaining current policies (a
“nonadjustment” scenario).
III. BACKGROUND
5.
This DSA updates the 2007 DSA (IMF Country Report No. 07/334 Supp.2); it
incorporates more recent macroeconomic data including on the Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG)
project, which is expected to begin production and export in 2009 and boost significantly
overall hydrocarbon output. The outlook also incorporates the most recent information on
and domestic oil reserves and production, actual 2007 debt data, and recent WEO projections
of key economic variables, including international oil prices. The risk rating remains
unchanged from the DSA prepared in 2007.
A. The Current Situation
6.
After three years of continuous decline, Yemen’s net public debt to GDP
increased moderately in 2007. This was mainly on account of an increase in the primary
fiscal deficit by over 8 percent of GDP, and the impact of debt-to-GDP ratio would have
been higher had it not been for relatively high nominal GDP growth. Net public debt
(domestic and external) increased from 33 percent of GDP in 2006 to 35.2 percent in 2007.
The 2007 fiscal deficit (5.8 percent of GDP; cash basis) was financed mainly by drawing
down government deposits at the central bank (by 1.7 percent of GDP, to 5.2 percent of
GDP), and by borrowing from the domestic bank and non-bank sectors (which increased the
1

For a weak performer, the indicative thresholds for external debt sustainability are an PV of debt–to–exports
ratio of 100 percent, and PV of debt–to–GDP ratio of 30 percent, and PV of debt-to-revenue ratio of
200 percent, a debt service–to–exports ratio of 15 percent, and a debt service–to–revenue ratio of 25 percent.

gross stock of domestic debt by
1.5 percentage points to 13.5 percent of
GDP). Although the external current
account deteriorated sharply in 2007, this
mainly reflected capital good imports
related to the LNG project—financed by
FDI. Consequently, external debt
declined by about 2 percent of GDP.

All external debt is owed to
official creditors, and is mostly on concessional terms. At end–2007, external debt
amounted to $5.8 billion, equivalent to 26.9 percent of GDP. Just over half of this debt was
owed to multilateral creditors (including $2.1 billion owed to the World Bank, $0.6 billion
owed to the Arab Fund for Social and Economic Development (AFESD), and $170 million
outstanding to the IMF), and the other half was owed to bilateral creditors (of which $1.2
billion to Russia, $0.3 billion to Saudi Arabia and $240 million to Japan). Yemen benefited
from a series of rescheduling arrangements under the Paris Club in 1996, 1997 and 2001.
Bilateral agreements under these arrangements have been reached with most of the concerned
donors. In 2007, Japan forgave about $8 million of debt owed by Yemen.

8.
Domestic debt consists mostly of Treasury bills, held by domestic bank and
non-bank investors. Non–securitized debt held by domestic banks has been declining and
amounted to less than 13 percent of the total stock of domestic debt in 2007. Treasury bills
are issued at 3, 6 and 12 months maturities; the weighted average yield was about 16 percent
in 2007. Although the majority of T–bills are held by domestic non-bank investors, banks
acquired two-thirds of net new issues in 2007, bringing their share of domestic debt from
about one-third in 2006 to more than 40 percent in 2007.
9.
Yemen does not have access to international capital markets, but official donor
support in the form of grants and concessional loans is expected to continue in the
medium and long-term. Donors pledged concessional loans of about $2 billion (and grants
of about $3 billion) at the Consultative Group meeting in London in 2006. Despite some
reported delays in translating these pledges into actual commitments, 2 active efforts by the
authorities to undertake an adjustment and reform program should help mobilize the
remaining assistance. New loan agreements for about $350 million were signed in 2007, and
for about $160 million in the first part of 2008.

2

Reportedly, about 65 percent of these pledges have translated into actual commitments following bilateral
agreements with the donors, although actual disbursements have been slow. This partly reflects the normal lag
in the implementation of projects, but the authorities also indicated some delays in coming to terms with
individual donors.

B. Macroeconomic Assumptions
10.
This DSA assumes that the authorities respond to dwindling oil production and
lower oil prices through strong macroeconomic policies and structural reforms that
facilitate economic diversification and help maintain macroeconomic stability. The
baseline macroeconomic framework (Box 1) assumes that real GDP grows by about 4½
percent over the long term. Underlying this assumption is strong fiscal adjustment—based on
enhanced revenue mobilization and containing recurrent expenditure—accompanied by
increased exchange rate flexibility, an ongoing commitment to containing inflation, as well
as structural reforms to improve the business environment and encourage investment. Under
these assumptions, the non–interest current account balance is projected to register moderate
deficits that would be financed largely by FDI. 3
IV. DEBT ANALYSIS
A. Public Debt Sustainability
11.
Even under an ambitious (baseline) adjustment scenario, public debt indicators
raise serious concerns about long-term debt sustainability. Net public debt currently
stands at 35.2 percent of GDP, a potentially large ratio in view of the government’s low
revenue mobilization capacity (non-hydrocarbon revenue was only 10 percent of GDP in
2007, of which tax revenue was only 7 percent). Although fiscal adjustment would improve
the debt–to–GDP ratio in the medium term, this ratio is projected to approach 50 percent in
the long term with the expected decline in oil revenue. The PV of public debt stood at
25 percent of GDP and 75 percent of revenue in 2007. These indicators are expected to
increase to almost 40 percent of GDP and over 170 percent of revenue by 2028.
12.
Standard stress tests highlight Yemen’s vulnerability to adverse economic
developments, such as a less favorable growth outturn or a weaker fiscal adjustment.
•

3

If real GDP grew by 3.2 percent in 2009–10 (below baseline projections but close to
actual growth rate of in 2006 and 2007), the PV of debt–to–GDP ratio would rise to
about 65 percent and the PV of debt–to–revenue ratio would approach 300 percent by
2028.

Net FDI are projected to turn into outflows in 2010 following the completion of a major LNG investment
project, but are expected to become positive again in the medium-to-long term.

5
Box 1. Macroeconomic Assumptions for the Baseline (Adjustment) Scenario
Given Yemen’s high dependency on oil, 4 the adjustment scenario encompasses a range of policy and structural
reforms to address the expected end of oil production by 2021. After crude oil production ceases, hydrocarbon
revenues are projected to drop dramatically to about 16 percent of fiscal revenues (from LNG exports and
domestic gas sales) and to 26 percent of total merchandise exports.
In the medium term (2009–13), real GDP growth is projected to average 5.2 percent, boosted by the start of
LNG production in 2009. Reforms center on fiscal adjustment, with an average annual reduction in the non-oil
primary deficit of 1.6 percent of GDP (after a larger reduction in 2009 due to lower oil prices). Key spending
reforms include eliminating fuel subsidies by 2012, containing the civil service wage bill, better expenditure
management, and increased (but better targeted) social spending, to protect the poor from the adverse effects of
removing domestic fuel subsidies. Tax revenue would be enhanced by over 3 percentage points by:
implementing fully the General Sales Tax (doubling the rate from 5 percent to 10 percent in 2011); improving
customs and tax administration; eliminating exemptions in the customs, income tax, and investment laws; and
introducing a tax on petroleum products (2012). Even with declining oil exports, the current account deficit is
expected to narrow from 7 percent of GDP in 2007 to 1.7 percent of GDP on average from 2009 to 2013.
The long term projections are based on the following policy assumptions:
•

Moderate real GDP growth, averaging 4.3 percent from 2014 to 2028, with non-hydrocarbon growth
close to 5 percent offsetting the decline in oil output. These assumptions are in line with the historical
experience: the non-oil sector grew at an average rate of 5.2 percent during 1991–2007. Continued
non-hydrocarbon growth will depend on sustained fiscal, financial sector, and structural reforms to improve
the investment environment, and sizeable donor-funded public investment.

•

Continued revenue mobilization efforts, notably through a further increase in the GST rate to 12 percent
in 2014, and further strengthening of the tax and customs administration to improve the efficiency of both
direct and indirect tax collection (GST, customs duties, excises on petroleum products, and income tax).

•

Additional expenditure restraint—including a concerted effort to reduce the public wage bill to below
6 percent of GDP by 2028—would also provide the fiscal space for the social welfare expenditures
required to smooth the transition to a predominantly non-oil economy.

•

A more flexible exchange rate arrangement, would allow the accumulation of external reserves that would
be later used to smooth the impact of the end of oil production in 2021.

•

Official creditors are expected to provide external financing on concessional terms over the projection
period, as the loss of oil production will require continued reliance on concessional external assistance.
Domestic financing is assumed to come from the bank and non-bank sectors at positive real interest rates.

Under these assumptions, the overall fiscal balance moves sharply into deficit with the loss of oil revenues
(nearly 6½ percent of GDP in 2021), but improves thereafter as reforms take hold. The non-interest current
account deficit, largely financed by foreign direct investment, widens to about 8 percent of GDP with the
depletion of oil in 2021, but narrows thereafter, with a pick-up in non-oil exports (from a low base), fiscal
moderation, and sustained inward remittances and official transfers.

4

Hydrocarbon earnings account for about 75 percent of fiscal revenues and 90 percent of merchandise exports.

6
•

Permanently lower growth over the entire projection period by ¼ of a percentage
point of GDP would result in a debt-to-GDP and debt-to-revenue ratio in excess of
50 percent and 225 percent, respectively, in 2028.

•

If the primary deficit remained unchanged from the estimated 2008 level, by 2028 the
debt-GDP ratio would approach 70 percent and the debt-revenue ratio would exceed
300 percent.

•

An oil price $20 below baseline projections in 2009 and 2010 would have a relatively
modest impact on the debt sustainability indicators, reflecting the decline in domestic
oil production and the shift to being a net oil importer.

13.
To highlight the critical need for reform and adjustment, debt dynamics were
also evaluated under unchanged policies (a non-adjustment scenario). Under such a
scenario, public debt quickly becomes unsustainable. In the absence of structural reform
and fiscal adjustment efforts, by 2018 the PV of public debt would exceed 100 percent of
GDP and debt service would absorb about one-third of fiscal revenues. Beyond this, public
debt would increase to such unsustainable levels so as to render a sharp (and potentially
destabilizing) adjustment unavoidable.
B. External Debt Sustainability
14.
Under the baseline (adjustment) scenario, Yemen’s external debt situation
entails a high risk of debt distress. Although all indicators are currently below the policydependent thresholds, the PV of debt-to-exports ratio is projected to rise above the
100 percent threshold by 2018 and the PV of debt-to-GDP ratio is projected to approach the
30 percent threshold by 2028. While other indicators remain below their respective
thresholds, the outlook is projected to worsen as debt accumulates and the resources available
to service it decline as a result of the loss of oil exports around 2021.
15.
This outcome is highly vulnerable to adverse shocks. Under stress tests, two of the
indicators (PV of debt-to-GDP and PV of debt-to-exports) breach their respective thresholds
while another two (PV of debt-to-revenues and debt service-to-exports) approach the
threshold level. Debt indicators are most vulnerable to a depreciation in the exchange rate,
lower export growth, and less favorable financing terms. A one-time 30 percent devaluation
of the Yemeni rial in 2009 would bring the PV of debt above 40 percent of GDP and almost
200 percent of fiscal revenue by 2028. If export growth remained one standard deviation
below its historical average in 2009 and 2010, the PV of debt would peak at 245 percent of
exports by 2025 and exceed 130 percent of fiscal revenue by 2028, and external debt service
would rise above 10 percent of exports. If interest rates on new external borrowing were
2 percent higher than in the baseline, the PV of debt would peak above 240 percent of
exports in 2025.
16.
Under the non-adjustment scenario, external debt would also become rapidly
unsustainable. Even assuming that financing would continue to be available on

7
comparatively favorable (but not fully concessional) terms, all thresholds are breached fairly
rapidly, and exceeded by a considerable margin in the medium term. Under these conditions,
little room would be left to absorb the shocks associated with the end of oil production
around 2021.
V. CONCLUSION
17.
This DSA confirms the results of last year’s DSA that Yemen remains at a high risk
of debt distress. Despite relatively low debt ratios at present, the recent deterioration in
macroeconomic performance and the medium-term challenges presented by declining oil
production and volatility in oil prices present considerable risks. Even assuming an ambitious
reform agenda, sound macroeconomic policies, and continued support from the donor
community, Yemen will face a difficult path in coming years. This highlights the need for
early action on key reforms to strengthen public finances, bolster debt management, and
boost prospects for investment and growth.

1/ Includes both public and private sector external debt.
2/ Derived as [r - g - r(1+g)]/(1+g+r+gr) times previous period debt ratio, with r = nominal interest rate; g = real GDP growth rate, and r = growth rate of GDP deflator in U.S. dollar terms.
3/ Includes exceptional financing (i.e., changes in arrears and debt relief); changes in gross foreign assets; and valuation adjustments. For projections also includes contribution from price and exchange rate changes
4/ Assumes that PV of private sector debt is equivalent to its face value.
5/ Current-year interest payments divided by previous period debt stock.
6/ Historical averages and standard deviations are generally derived over the past 10 years, subject to data availability.
7/ Defined as grants, concessional loans, and debt relief.
8/ Grant-equivalent financing includes grants provided directly to the government and through new borrowing (difference between the face value and the PV of new debt).

VII.

Safeguards Assessment

Under the Fund’s safeguards assessment policy, the Central Bank of Yemen (CBY) was
subject to the transitional procedures with respect to the EFF arrangement which expired on
October 28, 2001. The assessment, which was completed on May 23, 2001, concluded that
the CBY’s external audit mechanism was not fully adequate at the time.
VIII.

Exchange Arrangements

The currency of Yemen is the Yemeni rial. The Yemeni authorities maintain that the current
exchange rate system is a free float. However, staff are of the view that the exchange rate
system is a facto crawling peg, in which the rate of crawl has recently slowed to resemble a
conventional peg. Accordingly, under the IMF’s classification, Yemen is currently
considered a de facto conventional peg.
Yemen has accepted the obligations of Article VIII, Sections 2, 3, and 4, of the Articles of
Agreement and maintains an exchange system that is free of multiple currency practices and
restrictions on the making of payments and transfers for current international transactions.
The authorities most recent notification under Decision 144 advised that, in accordance with
UN Security Council Resolutions, Yemen had taken measures to block the accounts of
certain individuals and organizations.

Annex II. Republic of Yemen: World Bank Relations
A. Partnership in Yemen’s Development Strategy
1.
Relations between the World Bank and the Government of Yemen are close and
continue to cover knowledge and lending services in sectors critical to development and
poverty reduction. The Bank’s Board of Directors discussed the 2006–09 Country Assistance
Strategy (CAS) for Yemen in June 2006. This CAS was prepared after extensive
consultations with central and local government officials, civil society, private sector and
other donors. It also benefited from the Government’s Progress Report for the first two years
of implementation of the First Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (2003–05) as well as the
2006 Country Assistance Evaluation prepared by the Independent Evaluation Group of the
World Bank.
2.
The current CAS is based on four pillars: (a) increasing non-oil growth;
(b) improving human development outcomes; (c) improving fiscal sustainability; and
(d) addressing the resource sustainability crisis. During the CAS period, IDA intends to
provide about $100 million annually in financial assistance to Yemen through a selective
program of lending operations complemented by a strategic program of analytical and
learning services. Given the relatively limited amount of IDA resources available to Yemen,
the Bank’s larger contribution comes from its catalytic role in leveraging donors’ resources,
providing technical assistance to the Government and working with other donors to
mainstream new implementation approaches that can enhance sectoral performance.
3.
A new CAS is under preparation (Board scheduled in Q4 FY09), in parallel to the
Government’s mid-term review of its 2006–10 Development Plan for Poverty Reduction.
4.
In mid-November 2006, the World Bank co-chaired with the Yemen’s Government a
Consultative Group (CG) meeting hosted by the UK Department of International
Development, and sponsored by the Gulf Cooperation. The CG was attended by senior
officials from 39 countries and international development agencies, and a total amount of
US$4.7 billion were pledged to finance Yemen’s development for the four year period
2007–10. The pledge represented over 85 percent of the Government’s estimated external
financing needs.
5.
As part of the CAS, the International Finance Corporation (IFC), the private sector
arm of the World Bank Group, is supporting the development of the private sector in Yemen
through investments and technical assistance activities. The IFC focuses on enhancing
competitiveness of the private sector, further deepening the financial sector, promoting
investments in areas newly opened for private sector participation, encouraging sustainable
social and environmental development, and promoting good corporate governance.

7
B. Status of the World Bank Portfolio
6.
IDA. As of end of December12, 2008, IDA had approved 139 projects for Yemen,
valued at about US$2.6 billion, of which about US$2.2 billion have been disbursed. The
current portfolio has 19 active projects with a total net commitment of about US$881 million,
of which US$431 million are undisbursed. The sectoral composition (by value) of the current
portfolio is as follows: 47 percent for infrastructure projects (of which 22 percent for water),
19 percent for agriculture, 12 percent for education, 12 percent for health/social protection,
6 percent for a budget support, and 5 percent for public sector governance. Over the last three
years, portfolio performance has remained stable—disbursement ratio stands at 23 percent in
FY08. All the 19 projects in the portfolio are currently rated satisfactory. IDA financial
support will be provided as grants under IDA15.
7.
IFC. In response to the Government of Yemen’s efforts in opening certain industries
to private participation, IFC established an office in Sana’a in 2005 and has increased
investment operations in the country since then. IFC’s commitments have risen steadily in
Yemen, from no investments in FY05 to US$91 million in FY07 and US$24 million in three
projects in FY08. IFC is active in the financial sector, SME development, business enabling
environment, and preparation of a legal framework for mining. IFC has also increased its
activity in FY08 in Public Private Partnership/Transaction Advisory.
8.
In FY08, IFC committed US$24 million comprising: (i) US$5.8 million trade finance
guarantees with Saba Islamic Bank; (ii) US$8 million in University of Science and
Technology; and (iii) US$10 million in Maghrabi hospital. On the advisory front, business
management training (Business Edge) for almost 20,000 entrepreneurs and other individuals
(including 13 percent women) has been completed since FY05 in partnership with five local
training providers. In FY08, approximately 3,000 entrepreneurs and other individuals were
trained. In addition, IFC signed agreements with two large fast moving consumer goods
companies to train their SME wholesalers. IFC’s leasing TA is also commissioning a study to
assess and quantify the Yemeni leasing market to provide market information to encourage
investment. In FY09 to date, IFC has committed $0.39 million in trade finance guarantees
with Saba Islamic Bank.
9.
Relation with the Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency (MIGA): Currently,
MIGA does not have any activities in Yemen. However, the ministry of planning and
international cooperation has recently requested assistance to review its institutional
framework for investment promotion. In response, FIAS/MIGA is planning a rapid
diagnostic assessment of the overall investment promotion institutional arrangements in
Yemen with a view to offering recommendations for the rationalization of roles, mandates
and functions in this important strategic area of activity.

8
Annex III. Republic of Yemen: Statistical Issues
1.
Data provision has some shortcomings, but is broadly adequate for surveillance. The
most affected areas are: national accounts, price statistics, government financing statistics
(GFS), and balance of payments statistics. The Republic of Yemen has participated in the
General Data Dissemination System (GDDS) since April 2001. While some progress has
been made, considerable scope remains to improve the collection and dissemination of
economic statistics, in line with Yemen’s commitments under the GDDS. GDDS metadata
for most data categories have not been updated since May 2004.
Real sector statistics
2.
The Central Statistics Organization (CSO) recently revised and rebased the national
accounts with the help of an expert from the United Nations Economic and Social
Commission for Western Asia (ESCWA). Although important progress has been achieved in
terms of coverage, classification, and compilation methods in accordance with the System of
National Accounts 1993 (1993 SNA), significant work remains to be done to improve quality
of the data and the compilation methods.
3.
Based on the recommendations of the technical assistance provided by STA and
METAC during September 2001 to November 2006, additional measures and work are
needed: to ensure the accuracy and the speed of collecting and processing survey results; to
compile timely supply and use tables, to conduct quarterly establishment sample surveys that
will provide short-term indicators for moving annual benchmark series; to use the results of
2005 Household Budget Survey (HBS) that will improve estimates of household final
consumption; to conduct new surveys in areas uncovered; to better identify the informal
sector; and to update survey samples that will improve coverage. There is also a need to
develop short-term indicators for both current and constant prices, and to apply the 1993 SNA
framework consistently for all published national accounts data.
4.
Regarding price statistics, some improvements have been made in the compilation of
the CPI and the production of foreign trade price indices. METAC assisted the CSO in
developing a PPI, however its development stopped when financing was exhausted. With the
assistance of STA, the CSO constructed a CPI that is consistent with international standards,
updated the weights using the 1998 HBS, broadened geographic coverage with a sufficient
number of consumption items, and introduced a new framework to ensure consistency in
data collection (in timing, good specifications, and location). Recently, the CSO, with the
help of an expert from METAC, has rebased CPI series to 2005 and recalculated the index
for 2005–2008. The CSO is also currently working on updating the weights of the CPI basket
to reflect the results of the 2005 HBS, and is considering reducing the number of
commodities in the basket from the current coverage of 900 goods. STA missions have
recommended further improving the sources of data in general, expanding the price statistics
to cover different areas, and enhancing training and internal coordination within the CSO.

9
Government finance statistics
5.
The reliability and timeliness of GFS remain weak—particularly for detailed revenue,
expenditure and financing items. Yemen has received substantial technical assistance from
international agencies to improve source data from the accounting and budgeting frameworks
and information systems and to improve compilation methods, but progress has been limited.
There appear to be intersectoral discrepancies between the available fiscal data and the
Central Bank of Yemen’s (CBY) monetary statistics and balance of payments data.
6.
The January 2004 GFS mission found that, while the institutional coverage and
available detail of data have improved, there were still numerous departures from
international standards in classification and coverage. The mission encouraged the authorities
to: include additional information on financing and debt in the GFS Bulletin; expand their
data dissemination by communicating the GFS Bulletin, or the relevant data, to STA for
re-dissemination; and renew the dialogue and remote technical assistance for developing
their GFS. The August-September 2007 multisector statistics mission found that many of the
previously identified weaknesses remained in data compilation and dissemination—including
the incomplete coverage of the social security funds and the lack of coverage of certain
transactions. These shortcomings contribute, in turn, to problems in the compilation of
monetary and national accounts statistics. The concepts and definitions used to compile GFS
are in transition from GFS 1986 to GFSM 2001, and the authorities’ GFS Bulletin reports
fiscal data using a mixture of both.
7.
Fiscal data are published in the quarterly Bulletin of Government Finance Statistics
(GFS Bulletin) on the MoF website (www.mof.gov.ye), which provides annual, quarterly,
and monthly data, albeit with significant lags and irregularity. The authorities have not
reported data for publication in the Government Finance Statistics Yearbook from 2000
onwards. No sub-annual data are published in the International Financial Statistics.
Monetary and financial statistics
8.
The most reliable and timely data are the monetary and financial statistics produced
by the CBY. The CBY disseminates data on total official reserve assets and monetary
statistics with a lag of up to two months. To strengthen monetary statistics further, the
August-September 2007 multisector mission recommended to: (a) treat repurchase
agreements as collateralized loans; (b) separately identify CBY’s and other banks’ positions
with the local governments (as a component of general government); (c) uniformly
distinguish between private and public nonfinancial enterprises based on the effective control
principle; (d) consult with the Ministry of Finance (MoF) on a consistent institutional
coverage of the government sector; (e) consult with the IMF’s Finance Department on the
appropriate accounting for the IMF accounts in the CBY’s balance sheet; and (f) in due
course, uniformly adopt market price or equivalent valuation for securities and shares. The
CBY has made some improvements in the formatting and classification of items in the
monetary survey based on the recommendations of the multisector mission, but does not yet

10
report monetary data to the IMF’s Statistics Department (STA) using Standardized Report
Forms.
External sector statistics
9.
The CBY is responsible for compiling and disseminating balance of payments
statistics, and more recently, the international investment position (IIP) statistics based on
the IMF’s Balance of Payments Manual, Fifth Edition. Compilation tasks are performed on
an ad hoc basis, mostly relying on surveys (response rates that are generally poor).
Successive STA balance of payments statistics missions (2002, 2003, and 2005) have sought
to facilitate implementation of the action plan recommended by the IMF’s resident advisor
on balance of payments statistics (1998–2000), with only limited success.
10.
The 2007 multisector mission underlined weak coordination between the CBY and
other government agencies (such as the Customs Authority, the CSO, and the Ministry of Oil
and Mining Resources) as among the main factors impeding progress in statistical reform.
Coverage of the oil and gas industry transactions remains weak, and there are gaps in the
coverage of some current account items such as merchandise trade, transportation, travel, and
remittances; and in the financial account—notably in foreign direct investment (FDI).
11.
The 2007 multisector mission reaffirmed earlier STA missions’ call for better
coordination between the CBY and other government agencies for timely and effective data
collection and compilation (particularly in the area of merchandise trade statistics), and for
the reinstitution of discontinued surveys. Data questionnaires on FDI and selected items in
services have either been discontinued or not followed up, but the authorities are working to
reestablish FDI surveys. There is scope for further training in survey techniques and in IIP
compilation, and the authorities should improve the documentation and dissemination of
information on sources and methods.
12.
Quarterly balance of payments until 2007 and IIP data until end-2006 are provided
with long lags for publication in the Fund’s IFS and Balance of Payments Statistics Yearbook
(BOPSY). The CBY publishes external debt statistics within one quarter after the end of the
reference quarter for the banking sector, general government, and monetary authority.

Statement by the IMF Staff Representative on the Republic of Yemen
February 23, 2009
1.
This statement summarizes information on recent developments in Yemen that has
become available since the staff report was issued to the Board on January 22, 2009. This
information does not change the thrust of the staff appraisal.
2.
The WEO oil price baseline was revised in January. The average international oil
price is now projected at $50 per barrel in 2009, compared with the previous assumption of
$54.25 per barrel. As a result, under the adjustment scenario outlined in the staff report, the
2009 fiscal deficit is now projected at 6.1 percent of GDP (up from 5.7 percent of GDP) and
the current account deficit at 2.8 percent of GDP (up from 2.4 percent).
3.
In December, the cabinet approved an adjustment to the 2009 budget based on
reductions in nonpriority current expenditures, a postponement of selected investment
projects, and intensified efforts at non-oil revenue mobilization. The adjustment aims at
containing the deficit if oil prices remain below the initial budget assumption of $55 per
barrel. The authorities estimate that this adjustment would reduce public expenditure by
about 1.3 percent of GDP. However, this adjustment does not incorporate the full range of
measures envisaged in the adjustment scenario outlined in the staff report, and further fiscal
efforts would be needed to contain the deficit in line with this scenario.
4.
Coverage of the General Sales Tax (GST) has not yet been widened, although work
continues on simplifying GST administration and identifying and registering new taxpayers.
Work also continues on the income tax simplification project, with the assistance of the
World Bank’s Foreign Investment Advisory Service (FIAS).
5.
The authorities have adopted a revised CPI series with technical assistance from the
Fund. Under the new series, overall inflation was 11.2 percent in December 2007, rising to a
peak of 24.7 percent in March 2008, and then declining to 10.8 percent in December 2008.
The decline since March has been driven mostly by lower food prices. Monetary aggregates
continued to slow in December, with reserve money, broad money, and private sector credit
growth ending the year at 8.3 percent,14.2 percent, and 17.5 percent, respectively. The
central bank’s own gross reserves have remained stable, ending 2008 at approximately
$7.3 billion, compared with the staff projection of $7 billion—suggesting less pressure on the
balance of payments than earlier anticipated. In January, the central bank reduced the floor
on deposit-interest rates for the first time since 2000 from 13 to 12 percent.

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2008 Article IV Consultation with the
Republic of Yemen
On January 16, 2008, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded
the Article IV consultation with the Republic of Yemen. 1
Background
Yemen remains one of the poorest countries in the region and is far from achieving the
Millennium Development Goals. Oil production has been in decline since 2000. In the absence
of major discoveries, reserves could be depleted in 10-12 years. The start of a new liquefied
natural gas (LNG) project from 2009 will only partly compensate for the expected decline in
crude oil. Yemen faces considerable challenges in dealing with the transition to a non-oil
economy, generating strong non-hydrocarbon economic growth, ensuring fiscal and external
sustainability, and reducing poverty and unemployment.
Recent economic performance in Yemen has been mixed. Overall real GDP grew by about
3.3 percent in 2007, reflecting real non-oil growth of 5.3 percent and a 13.1 percent decline in oil
output. Overall growth is expected to pick up somewhat in 2008, with non-oil growth around
4.8 percent and a smaller decline in oil output. Inflation has been a serious concern. After falling
to about 9 percent at the end of 2007, core inflation (excluding the volatile prices of the narcotic
qat) surged to 26 percent by March 2008, largely reflecting a similar increase in world
commodity prices and local drought conditions.

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On
return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the
Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the
Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the
country's authorities.

2
A sizeable fiscal deficit emerged in 2007. A sharp decline in oil production, coupled with
inflexible government expenditure and only marginal improvement in the tax-to-GDP ratio led to
an overall fiscal deficit of 5.8 percent in 2007. For 2008, a deficit of around 5-6 percent of GDP
is possible in the wake of the recent drop in international oil prices, continued rigid expenditures,
and limited non-oil revenue improvements. As in previous years, a large supplementary budget
was approved toward the end of the year to validate additional spending on fuel subsidies and
an increase in wages, pensions, and social welfare transfers. Fuel subsidies continued to
absorb a large part of the budget (about 14 percent of GDP), and together with the public sector
wage bill account for about 50 percent of government expenditure.
Monetary policy in 2008 focused on exchange rate stability and controlling excess liquidity in the
domestic banking system. The rial has remained steady against the US dollar since mid-2007,
helping to mitigate imported inflation. In real effective terms, the rial appreciated by 8.5 percent
in the twelve months to October. The Central Bank of Yemen (CBY) used its full allowance of
Treasury bills to absorb domestic liquidity in the first nine months of the year, and has since
relied on central bank certificates of deposit (CDs) and additional foreign exchange auctions.
Broad money and reserve money growth through October were 15.5 percent and 10.9 percent,
compared to 17 and 11 percent, respectively, at end-2007. The benchmark deposit rate was
lowered from 13 percent to 12 percent in January 2009.
The external current account shifted to a deficit of 7 percent of GDP in 2007, compared with an
average surplus of about 2.4 percent during 2002-06. This shift reflected mainly FDI-financed
imports for a liquefied natural gas (LNG) plant. The external accounts benefited from record oil
prices during the first part of the 2008, but pressures appear to be emerging in the wake of
declining oil prices. The current account is projected to remain in deficit (about 2 percent of
GDP) in 2008. Gross reserves of the CBY were about $6.8 billion at end-2007, and are likely to
be close to that level by end-2008.
Some progress has been made on structural reforms. The long-delayed General Sales Tax
(GST) was implemented in 2007, but was only applied to a relatively narrow segment of
taxpayers—full implementation is slated for 2009. A tax simplification process is currently in
train which should eliminate exemptions in the customs, income tax, and investment laws as a
precursor to lowering the income tax rate from 35 percent to 20 percent. Other important
measures include the passage of a deposit insurance law, and the submission of a microfinance
law to parliament. Efforts were also made to improve the investment climate through launching
a one-stop shop (making it possible to complete business start-up at a single location) enacting
a new procurement law, establishing an anticorruption authority, and reviewing labor and
company laws.
Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors noted that Yemen’s non-oil GDP growth has been solid in recent years.
Progress has been made on a number of structural reforms, and Yemen’s financial system has
remained resilient to the global financial crisis.

3
At the same time, Directors noted that downside risks to macroeconomic stability and fiscal and
external sustainability have risen considerably in recent months as a result of the slowdown in
global economic growth and the decline in oil prices. In addition, the authorities face the
medium-term challenge of diversifying the economy and the government revenue base in light
of the expected exhaustion of oil reserves and revenue. Their task will be complicated by rapid
population growth, inadequate infrastructure, and weak institutional capacity.
Directors were encouraged by the authorities’ recognition of the challenges ahead, and
welcomed the recent actions to adapt to the rapid fall in oil revenue. However, a determined
policy response, involving further macroeconomic adjustment and accelerated structural
reforms, is needed in the period ahead. These efforts need to be supported by adequate
assistance on concessional terms from the international community.
Directors noted the high risk of debt distress illustrated in the Debt Sustainability Analysis. They
considered an ambitious fiscal consolidation effort to be the linchpin of successful adjustment to
declining oil prices and production. They agreed that the fiscal stance for 2009 may need to be
tightened further, and called for the early implementation of key revenue and expenditure
reforms and development of a prudent debt management strategy.
Directors welcomed the authorities’ commitment to reduce expenditure in the event that oil
prices remain below the benchmark price in the 2009 budget. They stressed the need to
strengthen public financial management and further prioritize public spending. This should
involve the gradual elimination of fuel subsidies in the current environment of low international
fuel prices, accompanied by a public education campaign and strengthening of the social safety
net. Directors also called for continued civil service reform and wage restraint to reduce the
large public sector wage bill.
On revenue, Directors welcomed the commitment by the authorities to fully implement the
General Sales Tax. They encouraged further efforts to broaden the tax base and to strengthen
tax administration in order to expand the non-oil revenue base.
Directors supported the commitment of the central bank to continue to focus on price stability.
They encouraged the authorities to improve the monetary policy framework, including through
improved coordination with fiscal policy and the broadening of the range of monetary policy
instruments. The recent reduction of the benchmark deposit rate is welcome, and should be
followed by further liberalization of interest rates and development of an inter-bank money
market.
Directors supported the current policy of maintaining a stable exchange rate to help achieve the
authorities’ inflation objective. However, they believed that greater exchange rate flexibility
allowing for a real effective depreciation of the currency may be needed in the medium term to
preserve external sustainability.
Directors welcomed the improvement in financial sector indicators. They observed that the low
level of financial intermediation remains a constraint on economic growth, calling for continued
financial sector reforms. The strengthening of minimum capital requirements and the

4
establishment of a deposit insurance scheme are welcome in this regard. Directors highlighted
the need to strengthen bank regulation and supervision, and encouraged the authorities to
request an FSAP update.
Directors underscored the importance of further structural reforms aimed at expanding non-oil
production and enhancing Yemen’s competitiveness. They welcomed the improvement in
Yemen’s investment environment, and urged the authorities to keep up the pace of reform with
a focus on transparency and good governance. Directors supported ongoing progress in
introducing a microfinance law, in developing a framework for combating money laundering and
terrorism financing, and seeking closer economic integration through discussions with the GCC
and the WTO.
Directors welcomed the efforts to improve the quality and timeliness of macroeconomic
statistics, and saw a need for continued technical assistance in this area.

Statement by Shakour Shaalan, Executive Director for the Republic of Yemen
February 23, 2009
1.
Wide-ranging macroeconomic and structural reforms undertaken over the past
decade—exchange rate unification and reforms in the fiscal, financial, and structural areas—
have helped underpin the robust economic performance in recent years. Chief among the
authorities’ initiatives are reforms of the civil service, public financial management, major
adjustment to fuel subsidies, introduction of a new general sales tax (GST), an anticorruption
drive, and improvements in the social safety net. Admittedly, however, the authorities have
had to balance their desire for a more rapid pace of transformation with potential social
tensions arising from relatively high levels of unemployment and poverty. The Fund has
played a critical role in supporting macroeconomic stability and in promoting the reform
momentum, highlighting the vulnerabilities emanating from the prospective depletion of oil
reserves. The authorities have generally shared and greatly valued Fund advice, and are
intent on deepening the ongoing economic transformation to address the new challenges.
Recent Developments and Prospects
2.
Economic performance has been affected by the ongoing global recessionary
conditions as well as declining oil production and lower oil prices in the latter part of 2008.
Non-oil economic activity is estimated at slightly below 5 percent in 2008, offsetting the
decline in oil activity and allowing for overall real GDP growth of 4 percent. Declining oil
production contributed to pressures on the external current account in 2007, as did
FDI-financed imports for a new liquefied natural gas plant, but the current account deficit
narrowed to 2 percent of GDP in 2008. Foreign exchange reserves rose to over 13 months of
imports at end 2008.
3.
Declining oil production has impinged on Yemen’s sound fiscal position and on
medium-term fiscal sustainability. The overall fiscal deficit, which had been contained at
about ½ percent of GDP in 2005 and 2006, swelled to over 5 percent of GDP in 2007
and 2008. To mitigate the impact of surging commodity prices on low-income families, the
authorities increased wages, pensions, and social welfare transfers and intervened to increase
the supply of basic food commodities in the first half of the year. In spite of efforts to contain
other expenditures, lower oil revenues could not be offset by commensurate increases in
non-oil revenues and expenditure reductions while preserving social cohesion. In the face of
rising budgetary financing and imported inflationary pressures, the Central Bank of Yemen
(CBY) maintained exchange rate stability and tightly controlled liquidity through selling
Treasury bills and CBY certificates of deposit, as well as foreign exchange auctions. These
measures were effective in slowing down growth in monetary aggregates and inflation,
which surged to 25 percent in mid-2008, came down to 11 percent by year-end.
4.
Yemen has been sheltered from the direct impact of the financial crisis but remains
vulnerable to commodity shocks and to global economic activity. The banking system has
low exposure to investments and financing through international credit markets and there is
no domestic stock market. Inflationary pressures stemming from high imported inflation have
seen a gradual reversal in recent months. A decline in regional growth could affect
remittances and non-oil foreign investment, thereby increasing the dependence on official

2
financing flows. The key challenge is to adjust to the sharp decline in oil production, lower
budgetary oil revenue, and foreign exchange receipts. Liquefied natural gas production will
help soften this adjustment somewhat for the next ten years, but the authorities are well
aware of the need to bolster non-hydrocarbon activity.
Fiscal Policy and Debt Sustainability
5.
The Yemeni authorities recognize the risks to public finances and external
sustainability that have emerged since the end of the oil price boom. As oil prices began to
decline in the latter part of 2008, measures were taken to compress expenditures including
fuel subsidies by raising the price of diesel to industrial users, so as to contain the deficit to
around 5½ percent of GDP, slightly below the 2007 level. The 2009 budget was originally
formulated on the basis of a crude oil price of $55, but they have since prepared scenarios
based on a crude price of $40 and $30. A cabinet decision was adopted in December 2008
that outlines cuts to a broad range of expenditure line items, reaching 50 percent of the
budgeted amounts in some instances. These cuts, amounting to 1.3 percent of GDP, will be
painful to bear and unpopular, particularly ahead of the April general elections. About onehalf of the expected saving will be generated from a 13 percent reduction in outlays for costs
of goods and services, while preserving priority programs such as security and hospital care.
The remainder of the expenditure cuts will be attained through reductions in subsidies,
bonuses and allowances and unclassified expenditures. The measures aim to limit the deficit
to 8½ percent of GDP at an average crude oil price of $40 per barrel in 2009.
6.
The authorities share the view that a sizable consolidation effort, in the range of
2 percent of GDP annually, will be needed to ensure fiscal and debt sustainability over the
medium and longer term as oil revenues taper off. They are in broad agreement with the
measures proposed that emphasize boosting non-oil revenue and trimming government
expenditures. On the revenue side, they are considering reducing during 2009 the exemptions
on the GST that were introduced in January 2007, and to raise the rate from 5 to 10 percent.
They have submitted to parliament a tax simplification project that is intended to reduce the
highest tax rate from 35 to 20 percent while eliminating exemptions to income and customs
taxes—a project that would broaden the tax base while reducing the administrative burden on
the private sector. They are also considering ways to contain the wage bill in nominal terms
and to increase domestic fuel prices to align them with international prices—but these
measures cannot realistically be introduced prior to mid-year.
7.
The authorities concur with the conclusions of the debt sustainability analysis (DSA)
which underscores the potential vulnerabilities of debt dynamics in Yemen. They recognize
that the ratio of debt to GDP could rise rapidly if no measures are taken to contain a widening
fiscal deficit. They note, however, that public debt remains relatively low and that a debt law
is currently under discussion that will set ceilings for domestic, external, and overall public
debt. Given the high risk of debt distress, the authorities are hopeful that all donors, and not
only GCC countries, would be mindful of the need for a high degree of concessionality.

3
Monetary and Financial Sector Policies
8.
Stability of the rial vis-a-vis the U.S. dollar has helped enhance confidence in the
currency, reduce dollarization, and dampen imported inflationary pressure. The authorities
consider the level of the exchange rate to be appropriate and welcomed the same conclusion
in the staff’s assessment. CBY officials intend to remain vigilant in monitoring and
controlling excess liquidity through selling Treasury bills and CBY certificates of deposit, as
well as foreign exchange auctions. In view of the decline in headline inflation to the target of
15 percent by end-December, the authorities reduced the benchmark interest rate on deposits
from 13 percent to 12 percent in early February. If needed, they will consider raising reserve
requirements and use Shari’a compliant monetary policy instruments.
9.
The authorities consider developing a vibrant financial system to be a high priority.
Over the past year, they initiated a number of reforms, including passage of a deposit
insurance law, establishment of a deposit insurance corporation, raising banks’ minimum
capital requirements, submission to parliament of a microfinance law, and relaxing limits on
opening Islamic bank branches. They are committed to stringent enforcement of prudential
standards and to address weaknesses in contract enforcement, which would encourage banks
to expand their clientele.
Structural Reforms and Investment Climate
10.
The Yemeni government will continue its efforts to further diversify the economy and
promote alternative sources of growth and employment generation. In addition to the gas
sector, there has been a concurrent focus on strategies to promote the development of the
country’s tourism and maritime activities, to capitalize on the coastal location and cultural
heritage. To encourage investments into these areas, they have undertaken a number of
initiatives to strengthen the investment climate. Key among these are the establishment of a
one-stop shop for investors, a new procurement law, and an active anticorruption authority;
as well as a comprehensive review of the company and labor laws. Consequent to these
efforts, Yemen’s ranking on the World Bank’s Doing Business report jumped from
113 in 2008 to 98 in 2009.
11.
Intensified donor support will be critical in view of the significant immediate
challenges and vast development needs. Donor support has been instrumental in helping to
sustain the authorities’ reform efforts aimed at tackling problems of widespread poverty and
limited institutional and implementation capacity. As highlighted in the donor briefing in
Sana’a on February 7, 2009, the authorities are well cognizant of the need for drastic
adjustment to bridge the gap between domestic resources and human and physical capital
development needs. Donor support can soften the pace of adjustment and help bring about
broader acceptance of the transformation.
12.
Finally, I would like to convey the Yemeni authorities’ appreciation to the staff and
management for the collaborative engagement with the Fund. They particularly appreciate
staff’s valuable policy advice during the Article IV mission and helpful technical assistance
they continue to receive from the Fund. They look forward to continued dialogue on the
policy priorities in the period ahead.
