STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2014 ARTICLE IV CONSULTATION
April 30, 2014

KEY ISSUES
Finland’s record of strong economic growth has stalled with the economy in
recession for three out of the last five years, largely because of domestic structural
weaknesses and a challenging external environment. Weak productivity and high wage
growth have eroded competitiveness, amplifying the effects of the declining ICT and
paper sectors. This has led to high unemployment and added to longer-term agingrelated fiscal pressures. Household debt continues to rise, adding to the highly
concentrated banking system’s vulnerability to regional shocks. Absent reforms, the
outlook remains for a slow and fragile recovery.
The priorities are reforms for growth, credible, but gradual, fiscal consolidation,
and measures to address lingering financial stability concerns.


Bold and rapidly implemented structural reforms would improve labor market
performance and boost productivity, while facilitating structural adjustment.
The government reform program is making progress, but the full agenda has yet to
be implemented.



Credible fiscal adjustment phased-in over the medium-term would support
fiscal sustainability while protecting the fragile recovery. A frontloaded fiscal
adjustment, as is envisaged in the government’s recent spending limits decision,
could weaken the recovery. A better alternative would be to increase the pace of
consolidation only as the economy strengthens, along with structural reforms to
raise medium-term growth.



Strengthening the macroprudential framework is critical. This would help
guard against underlying vulnerabilities and promote regulatory harmonization
within the Nordic region. The full scope and flexibility of CRD IV/CRR instruments
should be deployed, including establishing a systemic risk buffer and making LTV
caps effective.

RECENT ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS AND OUTLOOK
A. Recent developments
1.
Finland's strong recovery from the global
crisis was short-lived. After rapid growth in 2010–11,
GDP declined by 1 percent in 2012 and by an estimated
1.4 percent in 2013 (Table 1). Unemployment is
elevated, at more than 8 percent as more people went
without work for longer, and the output gap is sizable,
estimated at around 3 percent of potential GDP.
Moderating, but still positive, wage growth and higher
indirect taxes explain why inflation (2.2 percent in 2013)
remained above the euro area average (Figure 2).

2.
Behind the slowdown is a combination of cyclical and structural factors. The effects
from weak domestic and external demand in the wake of the crisis have been exacerbated by the
decline in the information and communications technology (ICT) industry and the continuing fall in
global demand for traditional exports such as paper and pulp (Figure 1). Longer-term structural
factors are also playing a role, including a rapidly aging workforce and declining total factor
productivity (TFP) growth. At the same time, the persistently weak growth outlook has affected the
confidence of investors, with private sector investment falling from over 20 percent of GDP in 2007
to under 16 percent in 2013. Highly leveraged households (mostly in the form of mounting real
estate credit) are contributing little to overall consumption growth.

The slowdown has come despite unusually favorable financial conditions, increasing
risks to banks. The banking sector, dominated by large Nordic institutions, has been operating in a
low interest rate environment, partially linked to Finland’s appeal as a “safe haven.” This has weighed
on banks’ margins and increased their exposure to riskier borrowers, especially through housing-

related loans. Overall credit has declined with the
weak economy, but household debt has continued to
grow, reaching 118 percent of disposable income in
2013, more than double the level in the late 1990s
(Figure 4). Standard metrics suggest that real house
prices are 8.5 percent above fundamentals.1

reflect a loss in competitiveness linked to high precrisis wage growth at a time when labor productivity was deteriorating (Figure 2). The slowdown in
productivity predominantly stems from weaker TFP growth caused, in large part, by the fading
importance of the ICT sector and the associated decline in patent and innovation activity.2 As a
result of this and an aging workforce, potential output growth is estimated to have declined from
about 3 percent on average in 1997–2007 to less than ½ percent in 2013.3
6.
Policymakers have begun to address these challenges. The government is pursuing an
ambitious reform agenda to improve the public finances and strengthen conditions for economic
growth, with some measures already in train. Also, long-needed progress is being made towards
putting in place a macroprudential policy framework in line with the evolving framework at the
European Union (EU) and euro area levels.

B. Outlook and Risks
7.
The recovery will be slow. Growth is projected to improve modestly, driven largely by the
expected improvement in euro area exports and gradually strengthening investment helped by still
low interest rates and building confidence in the recovery. However, in light of the expected
slowdown in Russia and the planned fiscal consolidation, the pick-up in growth will be moderate—
about 0.3 percent in 2014 and 1.1 percent in 2015. As a result, unemployment will remain high and
the output gap will shrink only gradually, with inflation decelerating to about 1.5 percent in 2015.
8.
A number of downside risks could further lower growth. Slower-than-expected exports
linked to a cooling of global trade, rising geopolitical tensions, or a protracted period of slow
European growth could easily derail the recovery. Domestically, high household debt could cause
consumers to cut back if interest rates normalized more quickly than expected, for example because
of changing global financial conditions. Rapid fiscal consolidation or a less growth-friendly budget
composition could further weaken demand. Finally, a financial shock, such as a funding difficulty

hitting the large Swedish or Danish banks operating in Finland, could impact financing conditions,
with potentially significant consequences for investment and consumption, especially if amplified by
a fall in house prices (see also Table 7 with the Risk Assessment Matrix).

The Authorities’ Views
9.
The authorities broadly agreed that the pace of recovery would be moderate and
initially fragile. They recognized that the growth path would be very dependent on the external
environment, especially the pace of recovery in Europe. Relatedly, the authorities acknowledged the
risks to growth from developments in Eastern Europe, as Russia is an important export market and
the source of all Finnish gas imports. However, they noted that the planned “growth package” (see
below) should mitigate short-term risks while structural reforms should boost medium-term growth
and facilitate adjustment, which could lead to export market diversification. Although household
debt is still rising as a share of disposable income, the authorities did not think this represented a
significant risk to financial stability in the near term. They also felt that the macroprudential policy
tools provided in recent draft legislation would help them address future risks in this area.

POLICY DISCUSSION
10.
Finland remains a high-capacity economy, but raising growth requires reforms. The
labor force is highly skilled and firms operate in a reliably favorable business climate. However, a
number of well-known obstacles—linked to the shrinking workforce, weakening productivity, and
the capacity for structural adjustment—are holding back growth and need to be addressed quickly
by structural reforms. In the short- to medium-term, the pace and composition of fiscal
consolidation should be designed to protect the fragile recovery. And completing and deploying the
full macroprudential toolkit would help guard against domestic and regional financial stability risks.

A number of new structural issues demand attention, particularly in the labor market.

improve by 6 years between 2005-10 and
2045-50, lifting the expected retirement duration by 3 years for men and nearly 4 years for
women.4 This contrasts with the government’s current plan to increase the effective retirement
age by 1.5 years by 2025, suggesting further increases will be needed after 2025.



Study times are lengthy. Finnish students take a relatively long time to enter the labor force. This
is partly due to cumbersome entrance processes that can delay entering university, followed by
long tertiary study times—with less than half of the students completing their degrees in the
targeted time. Even though universities rank high against the average of OECD countries, their
performance lags behind Nordic neighbors and

Wage levels are high relative to productivity. Unit

markedly since the onset of the crisis, reflecting,
among other factors, strong wage growth
against a background of generous
unemployment benefit replacement rates and

other OECD economies (Figure 2).

Low productivity growth points to
weaknesses at the sectoral level. To some
degree, the secular decline in TFP growth is a
consequence of structural change, with
manufacturing’s contribution to value added and
employment falling, largely due to the reduced
importance of Nokia. Although the services sector

(e.g., private healthcare, rental/leasing) is growing, its productivity tends to be lower. This is
particularly true for Finland's retail sector, which still faces among the highest regulatory barriers in
the EU—for example, from planning restrictions that limit economies of scale and market entry.
Despite the introduction of the 2011 Competition Act, retail market concentration remains high. The
productivity of Finland's large public sector has also been declining, notably in the provision of local
public healthcare and social services.
14.
In response, policymakers have set ambitious goals for reform. In November 2013, the
government agreed on a reform program that—in addition to fiscal reforms (see next section)—
includes measures to lengthen working careers, reduce structural unemployment, and boost the
economy’s growth potential.


Social partners, in coordination with the government, are discussing a pension reform that
aims to gradually increase the effective retirement by 1.5 years (to a still low 62.4) by 2025.
The discussions are to be concluded by end-2014, with implementation starting in 2017.



There are plans to streamline university entrance requirements and shorten study times to
accelerate the transition into the labor market. The government has already shortened the
duration of financial assistance to students (while increasing the level).



To encourage labor participation, active job seekers are allowed to earn up to €300 per
month without a reduction in unemployment benefits, while employment plans will be
monitored more closely. To improve the functioning of the labor market, policies are being
developed to encourage job seekers to consider offers across regions, employment services
for immigrants, the disabled, and long-term unemployed are being improved, and the child
home care subsidy and job alteration leave policies are being amended.



At the local government level, some mergers of municipalities have taken place and
personnel cuts in 2013 are estimated to have achieved €400 million in annual savings. The
plan to consolidate the administration of healthcare and social services under five regional
joint municipal authorities has the potential to improve economies of scale in these areas.
Detailed measures are to be formulated by summer 2014 and considered by Parliament in
the fall, with the operation of the new regional organizations to start in 2017.

15.
A rapid and comprehensive implementation of reforms would improve labor market
performance. In particular, the pension reform should become effective as soon as possible,
preferably even before early 2017. The reform’s impact on actual retirement decisions will require
close monitoring, including ensuring that the incentives linking life expectancy and the effective
retirement age are working. Reducing unemployment benefits’ duration and replacement rate could
add to ongoing initiatives to boost labor market activation by increasing job search incentives.
16.
There is scope for additional measures to boost productivity. The efficiency of the
provision of public healthcare and social services should be improved. Consolidating administration
of these services at the regional level, as recently agreed by the government and other stakeholders,

and standardizing data and information systems can be powerful tools in this regard. It is also
important to rejuvenate efforts to deregulate Finland’s retail sector, which would improve private
sector productivity overall. In addition, steps are required to adjust R&D policies to the post-Nokia
era, where innovation and growth might be found in firms outside the existing ICT cluster. In this
context, while R&D investment (3½ percent of GDP in 2013) remains high by international
standards, it could be better focused to support innovation, especially by young firms (e.g., through
well-designed tax credits). Moreover, better aligning research grants with performance, and
improving the design of pre-seed and seed stage support schemes may also help.
17.
Facilitating adjustment will further support growth. The transition from ICT to other
sources of growth will be facilitated by wage agreements that steer average wages in line with
productivity, while also offering sufficient flexibility to take into account developments at the
sectoral and firm level. Furthermore, reducing the reliance of the economy on the ICT sector by
stimulating innovation in other sectors would help improve productivity.
18.
Removing obstacles to labor mobility is crucial. Employment protection should not
become an impediment to adjustment—for example, in the context of local government reform. In
addition, increasing the quantity of affordable housing in urban areas where employment is
available will reduce obstacles to job seekers across the country. This requires reducing planning
restrictions and increasing competition in the construction sector. Tax incentives can help here as
well—for example, by raising property taxes on unused land zoned for development or improving
the treatment of income from investment in residential rental property. Finally, the supply of
affordable housing can be increased by higher government investment.

The Authorities’ Views
19.
The authorities agreed with staff’s assessment of the structural challenges facing the
Finnish economy and acknowledged the urgency of structural reforms. They pointed out the
measures already introduced as part of the structural reform program announced in the fall of 2013
(see above) that aim to tackle key issues such as labor market participation, retail sector
competition, and public sector productivity. While recognizing that further steps will likely be
necessary, the authorities also stressed the Finnish tradition of consensus-based decision making as
a factor in the speed at which some reforms can be introduced (e.g., pension reform). They noted
that one benefit of consensus-based decisions is that they are less likely to be unwound over time.
They acknowledged the advantages of broadening the focus of R&D support while pointing out the
challenge of determining the appropriate tools to achieve this. The authorities considered the
advantages of further labor market reforms, but pointed to the difficulties of implementing
measures at the early stage of a recovery while the social partners were engaged in pension reform.

B.

Fiscal Policy: Finding the Right Balance

20.
Finland’s fiscal position has deteriorated since before the global crisis, largely due to
rapid spending growth. Between 2007 and 2013, total expenditure increased by 11.1 percent of
GDP, with higher spending on social benefits, public consumption excluding wages (i.e.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

9

FINLAND

“intermediate consumption”), and the wage bill accounting for
90 percent of the increase. Spending accelerated even before
the crisis, largely due to generous public sector wage
increases and rising aging-related spending (e.g., on
healthcare), then continued to rise rapidly when the crisis
struck (Figure 3). Overall, around 60 percent of the observed
spending growth can be associated with structural factors,
with the remainder due to the weak economy (e.g.,
unemployment benefits).

22.
Local governments have been the driving force behind many of these developments.
Local governments accounted for approximately 70 percent of the increase in public consumption
(excluding wages) and wage spending over 2007–13. As a result, over the same period the
aggregate local government deficit grew by 0.5 percent of GDP, despite local government tax
revenues and central government transfers rising by 1.5 percent and 1.4 percent of GDP,
respectively. Local government spending accounts for more than one-third of general government
total expenditure, reflecting their large role in the provision of public services (e.g., healthcare), and
two-thirds of public investment.
23.
General government debt has risen considerably. The public debt ratio grew from

35 percent to 57 percent of GDP between 2008 and 2013 and is

close to breaching 60 percent of GDP this year (see the DSA in

well-established spending limits framework—reinforced by
the proposed new steering system for local government finances—provides an effective mechanism
with which to implement such a phased-in medium-term adjustment plan, while allowing automatic
stabilizers to operate should growth underperform. Securing broad-based political support for the
plan would further enhance its credibility.
26.
Instead, the government’s recent spending limits decision points to a frontloaded
adjustment—mitigated by off-budget measures to support growth. The fiscal stance in 2014 is
broadly neutral. But the decision on central government spending limits envisages a consolidation
effort of 1.1 percent of (2015) GDP over the 2015–18 period, of which 0.8 percentage points of GDP

would fall in 2015. If implemented in the 2015 budget to be submitted to parliament in late-2014, as
is assumed in staff’s baseline projection, this would amount to a structural adjustment of about
0.6 percent of potential GDP in 2015. At the same time, the government has announced a “growth
package”—worth about around 0.3 percent of GDP—and additional measures that are projected to
effectively offset part of the consolidation in 2015, so the net impact on output would be lower than
otherwise. The “growth package” aims to use asset sales and higher transfers from state-owned
firms to finance additional spending, mostly off-budget, in 2014 and 2015, including for R&D
support and one-off public investments, with much of the spending likely to occur in 2015. Among
the additional measures are plans to allow pension funds to finance new public housing
construction in urban areas starting in 2014, which could boost growth and labor mobility in 2015
and beyond.
27.
While difficult to gauge, the overall effect of these measures constitutes a drag on
growth in 2015. There is a downside risk that the proceeds from asset sales to finance the “growth
package” are lower than expected, which would result in lower spending and less mitigation of the
output impact of budgetary tightening. For example, simulations suggest that if none of the
mitigating factors discussed above were to materialize, growth in 2015 may be as much as 0.2–
0.4 percentage points lower than in the baseline, depending on the size of the fiscal multiplier.9
However, there are also upside risks. The central government’s 2015 budget might entail less
tightening than implied by the spending limits decision and local governments’ spending might be
reduced by less than currently planned. Finally, even if the size of the overall adjustment is as
currently expected under staff’s baseline, the composition of the adjustment measures overall could
differ, which would change the growth impact.
28.
In the medium term, the right budget composition would support growth. The already
relatively high level of taxation—Finland ranks third in the OECD in terms of the general government
revenue-to-GDP ratio—would suggest the consolidation should focus on expenditure cuts.
However, on current plans, higher taxes would contribute almost half of the envisaged consolidation
effort, through a mix of direct and indirect tax increases. This runs contrary to recent efforts by the
central government to make Finland’s tax structure more growth friendly. For example, the
corporate income tax rate was cut in 2014 from 24.5 to 20 percent—with compensating reforms to
dividend taxes that broadened the tax base, as well as increases in energy and excise taxes—which
should encourage higher investment over the medium-term. Recent local government tax increases
have also mainly been through income taxes instead of property taxes, which tend to have less
detrimental growth effects and vary less with the business

term. Simulations of the impact of structural reforms on output—based on OECD measures of
structural indicators and the gap between Finland and the OECD “frontier” and DSGE model
results—suggest that reforms could raise output by between 1 and 3 percent relative to the baseline
in 2019.10 This would be sufficient to put debt on a downward path over the medium-term. And the
simulations suggest that combining structural reforms with fiscal adjustment would lead to an even
faster decline in the debt ratio.
30.
In this context, measures that combine growth-enhancing effects with fiscal savings
are particularly effective. Pension reform is a central pillar of the government’s structural reform
program agreed in 2013. If executed as planned, it is expected to significantly reduce the
sustainability gap over the long term through direct fiscal savings (from the later retirement of
public employees) and higher revenues (by increasing labor supply and potential growth). The
proposed steering system for local governments’ finances—conceptually similar to the central
government’s spending limits framework—should help to contain spending growth over the
medium-term. Additionally, local government reforms to improve public sector productivity, such as
the consolidation of health and social services administration, should deliver further savings over the
medium- to long-run.

The Authorities’ Views
31.
The authorities recognize the risks to growth from rapid fiscal adjustment, but
ultimately view a potential loss of credibility as more important. They pointed to the difficulty
of securing broad-based support for a more gradual consolidation path extending beyond the
elections in 2015. They emphasized that their approach would help maintain Finland’s reputation for
responsible fiscal management in line with an earlier commitment to put government debt on a
downward path. The authorities also stressed the growth-enhancing nature of certain measures in
the “growth package” introduced in conjunction with the spending limits decision, which they
believe will reduce risks to growth next year. They defended the roughly 50-50 split in spending cuts
and tax increases as a key plank in the governing coalition’s agreement. Generally, the idea of
substantive property tax reform was not considered politically feasible in the near-term.

C.

Financial Policy: Ensuring Stability

32.
The Finnish banking system has proven resilient during the crisis, but the low interest
rate environment has left its mark on profitability. Banks’ capital ratios declined somewhat in
2013, but remain comfortably above regulatory norms and high relative to many European peers
(Table 6). However, with interest rates still at very low levels, the bulk of banks’ income stems from
non-interest earnings, including equity investments. At the same time, banks remain highly
dependent on wholesale funding, as reflected in a high and rising loan-to-deposit ratio (119 percent
at the end of 2013, up from 111 percent in 2012). Nevertheless, the Financial Supervisory Authority
(FIN-FSA) considers liquidity buffers adequate and in line with Basel III requirements, at least among
the large banks that are active in wholesale funding markets.
10

See Chapter IV of the Selected Issues for details.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

13

FINLAND

33.
Domestic asset quality is an area of concern. Nonperforming loans (NPLs) remain low,
rising slightly to 0.6 percent of total loans in 2013. But the aggregate measure masks a notable rise
in corporate NPLs, which grew by 10.8 percent year-on-year in 2013, while a decline in external
assets, primarily reflecting deleveraging within Nordea Bank Finland’s Baltic operations, has helped
reduce NPLs overall. Lending to SMEs remains subdued and larger corporates increasingly issue
debt amid still favorable capital market conditions.
34.
At the same time, household indebtedness continues to rise, helping to boost house
prices in certain regions. Household debt as a share of disposable income is around 120 percent,
up from just over 100 percent prior to the crisis, with both the level of housing-related credit rising
and disposable income declining in the wake of the crisis. The high level of housing-related credit,
including that incurred by housing associations, is reflected in elevated house prices, though the
level of overvaluation is lower than in other Nordic countries. However, the national average
conceals rapid growth in prices in large metropolitan areas (see Box 2).
35.
Risks to the Finnish banking system predominately stem from spillover risks due to
strong regional interconnections and the dominant role of foreign-owned banks. Nordea Bank
Finland and Danske Bank Finland are the largest banks operating in Finland. Although this can
provide a degree of stability (e.g., through supportive group level liquidity or capital management),
it also means that economic or financial shocks in Sweden and Denmark could cause significant
negative spillovers to lending activity in Finland. Moreover, group level policies—such as Nordea’s
consolidation of its derivatives business in Finland—complicate the signals from aggregate financial
soundness indicators and can result in an undue concentration of risk. While higher interest rates
would raise banks’ funding costs and could pose a risk to banks’ net interest income, the impact
would likely be limited for income from lending to households, as the bulk of this is via mortgages
with adjustable interest rates (see Box 2).
36.
The advancing EU regulatory agenda is an opportunity to strengthen Finland’s
macroprudential framework. Long-needed progress is underway as some CRD IV/CRR
recommendations are being transposed into national legislation under the draft Act on Credit
Institutions. The proposed empowerment of the independent Board of the FIN-FSA will create a
macroprudential authority effective from mid-2014, with decision-making powers over all adopted
instruments. The Board is comprised of representatives from the Bank of Finland, Ministry of
Finance, and Ministry of Social Affairs and Health, as well as two independent candidates, all of
whom are nominated by the parliament’s Supervisory Board. The represented institutions and
independent positions will have permanent voting rights. Importantly, the policy-making process
will be supported through surveillance and analysis, provided primarily by the Bank of Finland.
37.
Ensuring the full scope and flexibility of macroprudential tools identified by the ESRB
are available will be critical to the Board’s effectiveness. Finland lags behind its Nordic peers in
legislating a comprehensive set of macroprudential instruments. The current draft legislation
incorporates mandatory macroprudential instruments set out in CRD IV/CRR, but only at the
minimum standards for each tool and with very limited recourse to others. This unduly restrains the
authorities’ capacity to contain mounting risks, respond to shocks, or to fully harmonize regulations

To reduce risks from elevated
house prices, regulators must have the full capacity of tools to contain mortgage lending.
Plans to introduce Loan-to-Value (LTV) caps for new mortgages—set at 90 percent for current
mortgage holders and 95 percent for first time buyers—should directly reduce demand for a limited
portion of loans and help ensure credit quality throughout the cycle. Nevertheless, the provision of
collateral—including financial assets, deposits, property, and insurance instruments or state
guarantees—against the LTV caps effectively raises the amount of leverage that can be achieved.
This practice should be limited to avoid reducing the effectiveness of LTVs and also to maintain the
spirit of ESRB recommendations on their use.11

11

The ESRB recommends LTVs as a means to restrict the quantity of credit relative to the value of the collateral. See
“The ESRB Handbook on Operationalising Macroprudential Policy in the Banking Sector” at www.esrb.europa.eu.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

15

FINLAND

39.
A more targeted approach to LTVs, along with more stringent capital measures, could
prove highly effective in addressing localized housing pressures. Given the dispersion in
regional house prices, the Board should consider enforcing more binding LTVs (e.g., set at
80 percent for current holders and 85 percent for first time buyers) in certain metropolitan areas.
This could be achieved by tightening the collateral ceiling, as allowed for in the draft legislation. As a
complementary measure, higher mortgage risk weights for banks should also be considered. This
would help to limit the supply of housing-related credit when financial stability concerns arise and
ensure greater regulatory coherence at the regional level. Finally, the introduction of a national loan
registry would facilitate macroprudential monitoring of credit developments.
40.
The advancement of the Banking Union should enhance regional supervisory
cooperation. It is important to ensure that large regional banks are assessed at the group level
during the upcoming Balance Sheet Assessment, including by using like methodologies and
independent third party reviews. In support, binding regional agreements on resolution and burden
sharing, particularly in the Nordea Crisis Management Group, should be reached without delay. The
principles of these agreements should be in line with the Single Resolution Mechanism (SRM) and
Bank Recovery and Resolution Directive objectives to facilitate harmonization between Finland and
other Nordic countries when the SRM comes into operation. Similarly, once liquidity and funding
requirements are fully developed at the EU level, they should be harmonized across the Nordic
region to ensure group-level liquidity is adequately defined in branches and subsidiaries.

The Authorities’ Views
41.
The authorities acknowledged the importance of more fully implementing CRD
IV/CRR, including as a means to harmonize regional frameworks. However, they viewed the
outcome of the current draft legislation as pragmatic given the strong capitalization of Finnish
banks and lack of consensus on key issues at the European level. They did not exclude further
enhancing the macroprudential toolkit in line with European-level progress. The authorities also
recognized staff concerns over elevated house prices, but viewed the proposed LTV caps as
adequate, particularly given the recent moderation in mortgage lending and overall house prices.
The authorities saw some merit in future consideration of more binding LTVs, but noted that this
would significantly change the current structure of loan provision. They also broadly agreed with
staff on the possibility of using LTVs on a targeted basis to address regional house price pressures,
but thought it was necessary to first carefully consider any potential implications.
42.
The authorities welcomed progress toward banking union, seeing it as an opportunity
to further strengthen regional supervisory coordination. The authorities noted the potential
challenges of joint supervision of large banks operating across countries currently outside and inside
of the banking union framework. But they also pointed to the tradition of supervisory cooperation in
the Nordic region and stressed the role for the existing supervisory colleges, which could help
enhance coordination and promote a smooth transition to evolving European regulations.

STAFF APPRAISAL
43.
Finland’s recovery from the global crisis was brief. Real GDP dropped by almost
2½ percent during 2012–13, and unemployment has risen above 8 percent. The shortfall in growth,
coming at a time when peer economies saw GDP improve and unemployment decline, points to
deeper structural problems. Exports suffered from the continued decline of the ICT and paper and
pulp industries, but also because Finnish wage costs increased just as labor productivity growth fell.
Longer-term factors, such as a rapidly aging workforce, added to the headwinds.
44.
The outlook is for slow growth. With the gradually improving outlook for the euro area,
external demand is expected to increase over the course of 2014. This should eventually support a
rebound in investment, especially if interest rates remain low. However, GDP growth is likely to pickup more gradually than previously forecast, reflecting recent weak data and trade exposure to
Russia, as well as the planned fiscal consolidation. With a still sizable negative output gap,
unemployment will decline slowly, while inflation is projected to decelerate to 1.5 percent by 2015.
45.
The economic upturn will also likely be fragile. Weaker external demand could easily
derail the recovery—for example, because of negative effects from an escalation of geopolitical
tensions, or slower euro area growth. Domestically, high, and still rising, levels of household debt
could make consumers more cautious to spend if interest rates normalize faster than expected.
Finally, the growth outcome could also change with the timing and composition of fiscal adjustment.
46.
Bold and rapidly implemented structural reforms are needed to achieve higher
medium-term growth. Pension reform to lift the effective retirement age is crucial to avoid
declining labor market participation, as is encouraging younger workers to enter the labor market
sooner. Plans to improve the productivity of public sector healthcare should be specified and
implemented quickly. Boosting retail competition would improve overall productivity in the private
sector, while R&D investment can be better focused to support innovation, especially by young
firms. In addition, it is important that wage bargaining supports adjustment by steering real wages
in line with overall productivity growth, while ensuring sufficient flexibility to accommodate variation
at the firm and sectoral levels. Measures to increase the quantity of affordable housing would
facilitate labor mobility and matching.
47.
Fiscal policy should seek to balance growth and sustainability concerns. The
deterioration of the public finances has both cyclical and structural roots. Credible fiscal adjustment
over the medium-term—backed by continued broad-based political support—would ensure
sustainability and help protect the fragile recovery. The broadly neutral fiscal stance in 2014 is
appropriate, and staff simulations suggest that gradually increasing fiscal adjustment in line with the
expected strengthening of the economy would minimize the risks to growth. If growth
underperforms, automatic stabilizers should be allowed to operate.
48.
In contrast, the planned frontloaded adjustment risks slowing the recovery. The recent
decision on medium-term spending limits for the central government suggests that the bulk of the
fiscal consolidation could come in 2015, when the upturn will still be gathering speed. To reduce the

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

17

FINLAND

risks to growth, it will be important to steer the discussion of the 2015 budget towards making the
composition as growth-friendly as possible—for example, by increasing the contribution from
expenditure cuts, while preserving public investment, and shifting the revenue component of the
adjustment away from direct taxes towards property taxes. Full and rapid implementation of the
government’s “growth package” and measures to enhance housing investment are also crucial.
49.
A robust macroprudential framework is crucial to containing financial stability risks.
Despite relatively high levels of capitalization, banks remain vulnerable to risks stemming from
elevated house prices, high levels of household indebtedness, regional interconnections, and
dependence on wholesale funding. Thus, the planned legislation should maintain the full scope and
flexibility of the European framework (CRD IV/CRR). This would ensure that the independent Board
of the FSA has the capacity to respond to financial stability risks and to work toward full
harmonization of macroprudential tools across the Nordic region. The Bank of Finland is well placed
to support the new macroprudential policy-making process through surveillance and analysis.
50.
It is proposed that the next Article IV consultation with Finland occur on the standard
12-month cycle.

Box 1. Exchange Rate and Current Account1
After widening as Finland lost export market share after the crisis, the current account deficit is now
shrinking as external demand improves and domestic demand remains subdued. The current account
(CA) deficit improved from 1.4 percent of GDP in 2012 to 1.1 percent in 2013. The move from a pre-crisis CA
surplus to recent deficits was driven primarily by a drop in export demand, reflecting the break-up of Nokia,
the structural decline in global demand for paper and pulp, and declining competiveness. The recent
improvement in the CA deficit stems from slightly better external demand, as well as weak domestic demand
due to the persistently low confidence of investors and consumers alike.
Finland’s net international investment position (NIIP) remains positive, at 17 percent of GDP (Table 3).
Portfolio debt liabilities have come to dominate capital inflows since 2007. As a result, gross external debt
liabilities have doubled relative to GDP (to 240 percent of GDP in 2013), driving up the share of external debt
in total external liabilities to 80 percent (from 52 percent in 2007). This is largely due to Swedish and Danish
banks funding much of their broader euro area activities through their Finnish operations, as well as “safe
haven” flows during the crisis.

Box 2. Household Debt and Interest Rate Risk
Retail borrowing rates in Finland are at historic lows. The real average prime bank rate across key lenders
is slightly negative, down from around 2.7 percent prior to the crisis. This has cushioned the impact of the
economic downturn on households, but it has also facilitated higher household debt, boosted house prices
in certain regions, and challenged banks’ profitability. In the context of weak overall growth, this mix raises
the risks to both household and bank balance sheets from higher interest rates.
Household indebtedness has increased. A substantial
portion of household debt is comprised of variable rate
mortgages (largely tied to Euribor), but additional debt is
incurred through housing associations. Borrowing by housing
associations increased notably early in the crisis with the
decline in interest rates, and currently amounts to around €10
billion (or 9-10 percent of total household borrowing).
Although mortgage borrowing has cooled over the past year,
borrowing through housing associations remains elevated,
and whether amortized or pre-paid through personal loans,
adds to household debt.
House prices have risen the fastest in metropolitan areas.
The pace of house price growth has been pronounced in
Helsinki and other highly developed areas despite the crisis,
but less so in other regions, especially where there have been
declines in manufacturing and industry. Similar dynamics are
evident in the relative prices of smaller dwellings compared to
larger properties or detached homes, underscoring the
upward pressures on house prices in highly populated areas.

domestic interest rates. Higer interest rates could be driven
by a normalization of global monetary policy and/or risks in global funding markets, and would impact the
economy through several channels:

 Mortgage payments by households would rise over time. But the cushion provided by variable mortgage
amortization schedules and the prohibition of banks to unilaterally revise lending margins on existing
mortgages would limit immediate risks. FIN-FSA stress tests indicate only modest impacts on mortgage
serviceability from interest rates rising to as high as 6 percent.

 SMEs would be affected by rising rates, particuarly given already higher relative impariment levels on bank
loans, having negative knock-on effects to employment and household income.

 Private consumption would be weakened by higher debt servicing costs, amplifying the effects through
lower household incomes.

 House prices would be exposed to a downward correction. Estimates suggest that a 10 percentage point
decline in property prices in Nordic countries could reduce GDP by as much as 2½ percent, and private
consumption and residential investment by as much as 3½ and 28½ percent, respectively.1

 Household net wealth would fall with declining house prices, reducing household borrowing capacity

through lower collateral valuations and confidence effects.2 Finnish household wealth is high (on par, for
example, with Germany), but with a lower share of liquid financial assets. This suggests limited positive
income effects from higher interest income streams.

Strong regional bank interconnections underscore potential risks from other Nordic countries. Similar
interest rate, or other, shocks in Sweden or Denmark could cause marked revisions in the domestic lending
capacity of Noredea Bank Finland and Danske Bank Finland. Given the systemic importance of these banks,
the negative effects would be similar to those emanating from within Finland. As an example, the correction
in house prices elsewhere in the Nordic region has prompted local affiliates to reduce high loan-to-value
lending in Finland.

is assumed in the simulation. See Chapter IV of the Selected Issues for details.

1/ The Baseline is constructed from historical data on debt maturity, currency denomination of debt, and other characteristics of outstanding government debt. Projections are based on
financing needs and other related variables from reports of the Swedish National Debt Office and the Ministry of Finance. In the Historical scenario, real GDP growth, the real interest rate,
and the primary balance are set to historical averages. In the Constant Primary Balance scenario, the primary balance projection is kept constant at the 2013 Baseline proejction level. The
Contingent Liability Shock scenario considers a one-time increase in non-interest expenditures equivalent to 10 percent of banking sector assets. In turn, this results in adverse effects on
real GDP growth, which is reduced by 2 standard deviations for 2 consecutive years. The revenue-to-GDP ratio remains unchanged relative to the baseline; the deterioration in the primary
balance leads to an increase in the interst rate; and the decline in growth results in lower inflation.

PAST FUND STAFF RECOMMENDATIONS AND
IMPLEMENTATION
Past Staff Recommendations

Implementation
Fiscal Policy

Strong and credible commitment to a measured
budget consolidation, balancing output and
fiscal sustainability gaps. Fiscal adjustment
efforts should focus on expenditure restraint,
notably at the local level and via pension, old
age and healthcare reforms, as well as tax base
broadening. The efficiency of public services
needs to be increased.

Fiscal adjustment measures have been
implemented since 2012—including the most
recent measures decided in March 2014—but
two years of negative growth have weakened the
headline fiscal position. Since 2011 the
Government has in various contexts decided on
measures designed to reduce public expenditure
and to increase revenue. Measured in 2018
nominal terms the net effect of these measures
comes to around 3.1% of GDP. The standard VAT
rate was increased by one percentage point to
24 percent, with energy and excise taxes also
raised to allow for a broadly revenue neutral cut
in the corporate income tax rate from 24.5 to 20
percent. Pension reforms since 2012 have
increased contribution rates. The average
effective retirement age has risen to around 60.9
at end-2013 (from 59.4 in 2008).

Labor Market Policy
The wage bargaining system needs to allow for
greater flexibility in wage setting. Measures are
needed to ease labor market mismatches,
reduce structural unemployment, and induce
early entry into the labor force. Reforms of
tertiary educational financing could also
promote earlier employment among the youth.
At the other end of the age spectrum, the
unemployment pipelines ought to be further
restricted or eliminated.

6

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

The government has undertaken to reduce
structural unemployment through reforms of the
tax and benefits system and intensified active
labor market policy. The Finnish central-level
labor market organizations concluded a broadbased framework agreement in 2013. The new
agreement sets the framework for pay and cost
increases in branch-level collective agreements
for a period of 2 years, with an option to
potentially extend the agreement by one year.
Agreed wage increases are moderate. On
education, the duration of financial support for
tertiary students has been reduced, the financing
of tertiary education has been reformed to
encourage faster graduation, and university
entrance procedures have been streamlined.
Since 2013, a “Youth Guarantee,” offers youth,
within 3 months of becoming unemployed, a

FINLAND

job, on-the-job training, a study place, or a
period in a workshop or retraining.
Competition Policy
Increase competition in services and product
markets, especially in ‘sheltered’ sectors, to
boost productivity growth.

The 2011 Competition Act brought regulation in
line with recommendations from the European
Commission. It allows for stricter merger control,
enhanced damage compensation, whistleblowing instruments, and expanded investigative
powers for the Finnish Competition Authority.
Recent reform proposals aim to build on this,
including measures to increase retail and
construction sector competition.

Financial Sector Policy
Bank capital and liquidity buffers should be
gradually enhanced. Supervision and crisis
management frameworks for large cross-border
institutions must be strengthened, with ex-ante
burden-sharing guidelines defined to limit
contagion. Vigilance on liquidity risk and banks’
funding and risk profiles should be stepped up.
An independent Macroprudential Policy council
should be established and macroprudential
policy tools reinforced, including binding LTV
ratio and countercyclical capital buffers (CCBs). A
national loan registry should be developed to
assist systemic risk monitoring.

A Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) on
financial stability, crisis management, and crisis
resolution has been signed among the Nordic
and Baltic authorities in 2012. Legislation to
establish the independent FIN-FSA board as
macroprudential policy authority has been
drafted. A government bill to designate the
independent FIN-FSA board as macroprudential
policy authority has been submitted to
Parliament. The draft legislation includes the
option for the FIN-FSA Board to apply
macroprudential policy tools, including CCBs and
an adjustable and binding LTV-ratio. In February
2014, a Government working group proposed
new legislation on the resolution of financial
market crises, a new crisis resolution structure
for authorities, and the establishment of a new
Deposit Guarantee and Resolution Fund.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
May 28, 2014

International Monetary Fund
700 19th Street, NW
Washington, D.C. 20431 USA

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2014 Article IV Consultation with Finland
On May 21, 2014 the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded
the Article IV consultation with Finland.1
Finland’s strong economic record has stalled. The economy has been in recession for three of
the last five years, and unemployment is now more than 8 percent, with more people without
work for longer. The shortfall in growth, coming at a time when peer economies saw GDP
improve and unemployment fall, points to deeper, structural problems. Exports suffered from
the continued decline of the information and communications technology industry and falling
demand for paper and pulp, but also because Finnish wage costs increased when labor
productivity deteriorated. Longer-term factors such as a rapidly aging workforce added to the
headwinds. Inflation, while above the euro area average, has recently been decelerating.
Against this background, government debt has been rising toward 60 percent of GDP.
The outlook is for a slow and fragile recovery. Weaker external demand could easily derail
the upswing—for example, because of negative effects from an escalation of geopolitical
tensions. Domestically, the growth outcome could change with the timing and composition of
fiscal adjustment. While the Finnish banking system remains strong, it is highly concentrated
with a majority of assets controlled by subsidiaries of foreign Nordic banks, exposing it to
the risk of short-term funding shortfalls and financial-sector spillovers. And still rising levels
of household debt could make consumers more cautious to spend if interest rates normalize
faster than expected.

1

Under Article IV of the IMF’s Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with members,
usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial information, and discusses
with officials the country’s economic developments and policies. On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a
report, which forms the basis for discussion by the Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the
Managing Director, as Chairman of the Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary
is transmitted to the country’s authorities. An explanation of any qualifiers used in summing up can be found
here: http://www.imf.org/external/np/sec/misc/qualifiers.htm.

Reforms are under way to support growth and address risks. Finland remains a high-capacity
economy with a skilled labor force and favorable business climate, and there are plans to
boost public sector productivity by consolidating the local administration of health and social
services and lengthen working careers. However, there is ample scope for reforms to address
obstacles to longer-term growth, such as the shrinking workforce and the slowdown in
private sector productivity growth. In the short- to medium-term, the newly set expenditure
ceilings will help strengthen the public finances, but the path of the recovery depends
critically on the implementation. Additionally, draft legislation to strengthen macroprudential
policy, and reform of financial regulation at the European level promise to help guard against
domestic and regional financial stability risks.
Executive Board Assessment2
Executive Directors noted that Finland remains a high-capacity economy and commended
the Finnish authorities for their strong economic record and well-deserved reputation for
implementation of sound policies. Noting the challenges posed by domestic and external
factors and that significant downside risks remain, Directors recommended bold corrective
actions to help reorient the economy, enhance competitiveness, and lift long-term growth and
employment prospects. They called for a three-pronged strategy encompassing growthfriendly fiscal adjustment, productivity-enhancing structural reforms, and strengthened
financial sector oversight and macroprudential regulation.
Directors noted that fiscal policy should strike an appropriate balance between supporting
growth and securing sustainability, and recommended full implementation of the authorities’
growth package. Many Directors recommended a front-loaded fiscal adjustment to help
stabilize the public debt and maintain credibility, while a number of Directors supported a
more gradual consolidation to better underpin the nascent recovery. Directors encouraged the
authorities to make the composition of the 2015 budget as growth-friendly as possible, by
increasing the contribution from expenditure cuts; shifting some of the tax burden from direct
to property taxes; and allowing automatic stabilizers to operate. Over the medium term, fiscal
efforts should aim to better manage the growth of local government spending and mitigate
health and long-term care costs.
Directors called for a strengthened macroprudential framework to help guard against
financial vulnerabilities and promote stability. Notwithstanding relatively high levels of
capitalization, banks remain vulnerable to risks stemming from the low interest rate

environment, elevated house prices and household indebtedness, regional interconnections,
and dependence on wholesale funding. Directors welcomed the authorities’ plans to appoint
the independent Board of the Finnish Financial Supervisory Authority (FIN-FSA) as the
macroprudential authority. They also underscored that the macroprudential toolkit of the
FIN-FSA Board should be harmonized with the European framework, in order to enhance its
effectiveness and ensure consistency throughout the Nordic region. Relatedly, Directors
called for further efforts to strengthen cross-country supervision and crisis resolution
frameworks.
Directors emphasized the need for productivity-enhancing labor market and regulatory
reforms in a number of areas. Such measures included: refocusing public Research and
development (R&D) expenditures toward basic research and young firms, addressing retail
sector regulatory barriers, boosting service sector competition, aligning wage growth with
labor productivity, and increasing the supply of affordable housing to improve labor
mobility. They welcomed the steps towards increasing the effective retirement age and
encouraged further pension reform designed to raise labor force participation.

Statement by Ms. Meyersson, Executive Director for Finland
and Mr. Miettinen, Advisor to Executive Director
May 21, 2014

We would like to start by conveying our authorities’ gratitude to staff for the detailed
discussions during the Article IV consultations and for the thorough analysis of the Finnish
economy. An independent analysis of our economic policies and challenging economic situation
is particularly welcome at the current juncture. The Finnish authorities agree on balance with the
findings presented in the staff reports. While there are some differences about the timing and
composition of fiscal measures aimed at securing fiscal sustainability in the long run, many of
staff’s recommendations are in line with the policies that are being implemented.
Recent Economic Developments and Outlook
Finland’s economic performance was strong from 2000 until 2008, but the financial crisis hit the
country hard. Finland’s economy plummeted in 2009 by 8.5 percent, but recovered well during
2010 and 2011. The Finnish economy contracted again in 2012 and 2013 due to weak demand
and the prolonging of the euro area sovereign debt crisis. The latest decline has pushed
unemployment in Finland above 8 percent. After falling two years in succession, GDP is
expected to gradually return to growth. According to the Ministry of Finance’s latest forecast,
Finnish GDP is expected to post growth of 0.5 percent in 2014. In 2015, GDP growth will pick
up to 1.4 percent, and be increasingly broadly-based.
The factors underlying the weaknesses of the Finnish economy are well captured in the staff
report and some of them are of fundamental nature. As pointed out by staff, labor productivity
has been poor since the financial crisis. Part of the reason for this lies in the declined
contribution of high-productivity sectors to total output. Return to sustainable growth and
elimination of a significant sustainability gap, estimated by the Ministry of Finance to be 3
percent of GDP, requires timely implementation of major structural reforms.
The outlook in Europe, Finland’s principal export market, is now brighter than in the past few
years, which will boost Finnish companies’ export demand. The last round of wage negotiations
produced a moderate wage increases that marks the first step towards regaining lost
competitiveness. Maintaining moderation in wage agreements is an essential part of restoring
Finnish competitiveness also in the longer term. As a result of the agreed wage developments,

2
real earnings are projected to decline. This results in weak domestic demand which is expected
to pick-up only in 2016 in the Ministry’s latest forecast.
Despite the recent positive trend in the global economy and the improved outlook in the
domestic economy, the risks in the outlook are still predominantly to the downside. The
authorities agree with staff that delays in the recovery of the Finnish trading partners pose a risk
to export-led growth projections. In particular, spillover effects from the crisis in Ukraine and
recession in Russia will exert downside risks to Finland’s expected recovery.
One of the most significant domestic challenges is to improve the efficiency of the labor market.
Population ageing coupled with the mismatch problems in the labor market may become a real
obstacle to growth.
Macroeconomic policies and the reform agenda
The long-run challenges of the Finnish economy and public finances are clear, and the policies
to tackle these challenges mutually acknowledged: bold and rapidly implemented structural
reforms are needed to achieve higher growth in the medium to long term.
Regarding the short run, the policy recommendation is not as straightforward. Here the key
question is how to sustain economic recovery and promote growth without risking confidence in
fiscal stability and sustainability in the long run. The appropriate policy orientation depends on
how the risks and benefits of the alternative options are emphasized. Staff’s report emphasizes
the short-run risks of fiscal consolidation on recovery. The analysis and recommendation rest,
among other things, on staff’s estimates of the size of the output gap and fiscal multipliers which
are inherently uncertain. In its recent decisions, the Government has recognised these elements
but also taken into account the risks of sharply climbing public debt on fiscal stability.
The Government’s fiscal and economic policy is geared to bridging the sustainability gap in
public finances. In the autumn of 2013, the Government announced a new structural policy
programme aimed at improving the conditions for economic growth and to close the
sustainability gap.
Most of the favourable effects of the reforms on growth and fiscal sustainability will only
materialise in the long run. Since this route is considered very slow and if deficits remain
significant, there is a risk that state debt will spiral out of control once interest rates return to
normal. Reducing central government deficit in a credible way is important to preserving
confidence and to preventing a vicious circle of escalating debt in the medium term, before the
structural reforms have the chance to make an impact.

3
The Government decisions in March 2014 on new consolidation measures and their timing take
into account these concerns. The growth package, which supports seed financing for innovations
and important infrastructure investments, mitigates the negative impact of the consolidation on
the economy to some extent in 2015-2016.
The staff report correctly points to structural weaknesses in the Finnish economy. The
Government’s structural reform program tackles these weaknesses in five areas: i) improving
productivity in the public sector; ii) lengthening working careers; iii) lowering structural
unemployment; iv) improving the economy’s growth potential; and v) strengthening local
government finances.
Labor market
The social partners are negotiating on the pension reform that aims at increasing the effective
age of retirement by a minimum of 1.5 years. The consensus-based decision making regarding
this issue has taken some time, and the expectation is to finalize discussions in fall of 2014 to
deliver the changes as soon as possible. The government has undertaken measures to reduce
unemployment through reforms of the tax and benefit system and intensified active labor market
policy. From the beginning of this year, it has been possible to receive some earnings without
losing the unemployment benefit or housing allowance. Employment will be actively offered to
unemployed by employment offices, and sanctions for persons that do not accept employment
will be enacted. As pension reforms are prioritized, some other labor market reforms which staff
points to, have received less attention.
The government has already introduced legislation to provide incentives for earlier completion
of studies. In addition, more weight is placed on the matriculation examination at the entry into
higher education and intakes have been increased to expedite the eventual entry to working life.
With the announcement of the latest fiscal policies the government also announced reforms to
support new housing investment in the capital region.
Healthcare
A significant part of the public expenditure is spent on healthcare and social services in Finland.
In March 2014 the government and the opposition parties agreed on the implementation of a
comprehensive reform of social welfare and healthcare services in Finland. The reform will
consolidate social welfare and healthcare services into five regions that are large enough to
deliver economies of scale. In particular, this reform allows for closing efficiency gaps between
specialized care units, more efficient exploitation of new technologies and division of labor

4
between and inside the regions and more efficient control at the national level. The plan is to
have this reform in place by 2017.
Local governments
The reform agenda includes measures to strengthen local government finances. A new steering
system will be implemented in 2015 that enables better safeguards for the sustainability of
municipality finances. The new steering system should ensure that the municipalities’
obligations are consistent with balanced budgets. In addition, the agenda includes measures that
improve public service productivity. Municipalities have already embarked on cutting costs and
increasing municipality taxes. Some municipal mergers have also taken place.
The extensive reform plan notwithstanding, more work is needed to implement these reforms.
Financial sector policies
The Finnish authorities have drafted a national legislation for implementing the Capital
Requirements Directive (CRD IV) in compliance with the Capital Regulations Regulation
(CRR). The legislation was sent to parliament in April this year. The draft legislation proposes
to fulfill the mandatory requirements of the CRD IV. Staff draws attention to the possibility of
regulatory arbitrage and to the current design of the legislation. The authorities are well aware of
these concerns and are ready to adjust the legislation if warranted.
In addition to the mandatory criteria, the legislation introduces an adjustable LTV cap to the
mortgage markets. There is a provision to use collateral in the calculation of the LTV cap, and
this provision, along with the LTV cap itself, can be changed by the Finnish FSA board to be
more stringent. The authorities are well aware of the risks related to the mortgage market, and
households and banks have been prompted to make stress calculations with higher interest rates.
On average, Finnish mortgage LTVs are not alarmingly high, as was also shown in the Nordic
Regional Report, but the average masks a concentration of debt to more indebted households.
The proposal endows the FIN-FSA board with the necessary tools to address risks in the
mortgage market if necessary.
