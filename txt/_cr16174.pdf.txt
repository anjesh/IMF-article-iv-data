IMF Executive Board Completes the First Review under the ECF Arrangement for São
Tomé and Príncipe and Approves US$0.9 Million Disbursement
The Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) today completed the first review
of São Tomé and Príncipe’s performance under the economic program supported by an Extended
Credit Facility (ECF) arrangement.1 Completion of the review enables the disbursement of SDR
634,285 (about US$ 0.9 million), bringing total disbursements under the arrangement to SDR
1.27 million (about US$ 1.8 million).
In completing the review, the Executive Board also approved a waiver for the nonobservance of
the end-December 2015 performance criterion on the domestic primary deficit, based on the
corrective measures introduced by the authorities. The Executive Board also approved new
program targets for 2016.
São Tomé and Príncipe’s three-year ECF arrangement for SDR 4.44 million (about
US$ 6.3 million or 60 percent of quota) was approved by the Executive Board on July 13, 2015
(see Press Release No. 15/336). It supports the government’s economic reform program for
stronger and more inclusive growth, and it also plays a catalytic role for bilateral and multilateral
assistance.
Following the Executive Board’s discussion on São Tomé and Príncipe, Mr. Min Zhu, Deputy
Managing Director and Acting Chair, made the following statement:

1

The ECF is a lending arrangement that provides sustained program engagement over the medium to long term in
case of protracted balance of payments problems.

2

“São Tomé and Príncipe’s economy has been resilient even after prospects for commercial oil
production became uncertain with the withdrawal of a large oil company from exploration. In
addition, performance under the program supported by the Extended Credit Facility has been
satisfactory. International reserves have increased, and inflation has continued to decline,
reaching its lowest level in the past two decades. Fiscal performance was, however, impacted by
tax revenue underperformance.
“GDP growth is projected to pick up to 5 percent in 2016—albeit below the authorities’ mediumterm target of 6 percent needed to significantly impact poverty—aided by higher public
investments, a recovery in cocoa production, and increased foreign direct investment in the
tourism sector. Inflation is expected to remain around 4 percent in 2016 and stabilize around
3 percent over the medium term, while the current account deficit is set to contract further.
“The authorities’ 2016 economic program focuses appropriately on sustaining the fiscal
consolidation to help bring debt toward a moderate risk of debt distress. This will require
sustained efforts to boost tax revenue collection, clear arrears, strengthen expenditure monitoring
and control, and gradually scale up the infrastructure program, which will be backed by
enhanced investment management capacity in project selection, implementation, and evaluation.
Strengthening debt management capacity and continued reliance on grants and concessional
financing will help mitigate the high risk of debt distress.
“The outlook is facing macro-financial challenges. Elevated bank lending risks and potential
contingent claims on the budget, in an environment marked by rising nonperforming loans and
highly indebted households and businesses, will continue to hold back private sector credit
expansion and the prospects for higher growth. Against this backdrop, the authorities are
working to increase the banking system’s efficiency, profitability, and resilience.
“Looking ahead, it is important that the authorities maintain the policy resolve and commitment
demonstrated so far, especially in an election year, to mitigate these risks and bring the benefits
of reforms to a broader segment of the population.”

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2016 Article IV Consultation with São Tomé and Príncipe
On June 10, 2016, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded the
2016 Article IV consultation1 with the Democratic Republic of São Tomé and Príncipe.
São Tomé and Príncipe’s economy has been resilient even after prospects for commercial oil
production, which dominated the political and economic narrative until end-2013, became
uncertain with the withdrawal of a large oil company from exploration in the Joint Development
Zone shared with Nigeria. São Tomé and Príncipe’s economic performance has been positive,
despite a slowdown in growth in 2015. Real GDP in 2015 is estimated to have fallen below the
projected 5 percent by almost 1 percentage point, driven by poor rains affecting crop yields,
particularly, cocoa production and delayed implementation of public investment projects.
Inflation fell below the projected 5 percent, aided by weakened demand and falling international
prices of oil and other commodities.
The medium-term outlook is favorable but challenges remain. GDP is projected to grow by
5 percent in 2016—below the authorities’ medium-term sustained target of 6 percent needed to
significantly impact poverty—aided by higher public investments, a recovery in cocoa
production, and increased foreign direct investment in the tourism sector. The authorities are
however, facing macro-financial challenges. Elevated bank lending risks and potential contingent
claims on the budget, in an environment marked by rising nonperforming loans (NPLs) and
highly indebted households and businesses, will continue to hold private sector credit expansion
and the prospects for higher growth. Inflation is expected to remain around 4 percent in 2016,
and further stabilize around 3 percent over the medium term, on the back of falling international
prices of food and petroleum products. The current account deficit is set to contract further in
line with weaker-than-estimated demand and lower-than-expected commodity prices.
Executive Board Assessment2
1

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with members, usually
every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial information, and discusses with officials
the country's economic developments and policies. On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which
forms the basis for discussion by the Executive Board.
2

At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the Board, summarizes the views of
Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the country's authorities. An explanation of any qualifiers
used in summings up can be found here: http://www.imf.org/external/np/sec/misc/qualifiers.htm.

2
Executive Directors agreed with the thrust of the staff appraisal. They welcomed São Tomé and
Príncipe’s progress toward greater macroeconomic stability, marked by sustained growth,
declining inflation, and stable international reserves, even after prospects for commercial oil
production became uncertain. Directors noted, however, that while some progress has been
made, challenges remain and poverty is still high. Against this backdrop, they called for further
efforts to enhance the economy’s resilience by strengthening the financial sector, maintaining
fiscal discipline, and implementing reforms to support sustainable and inclusive growth.
Directors supported the authorities’ commitment to sustain the fiscal consolidation in order to
bring debt toward a moderate risk of debt distress. In this regard, they stressed the importance of
boosting tax revenue collection, clearing arrears, strengthening expenditure monitoring and
control, and gradually scaling up the infrastructure program, which should be backed by
enhanced investment management capacity. Directors also called for strengthening debt
management capacity and for continued reliance on grants and concessional financing to mitigate
the high risk of debt distress.
Directors stressed that maintaining financial stability is crucial. In this regard, they welcomed the
authorities’ decision to develop a strategy to address the large stock of non-performing loans
and, where necessary, review provisioning practices and minimum capital requirements to ensure
that banks are well capitalized. Directors also encouraged the introduction of a contingency plan
to deal with potential fiscal risks. In addition, they called on the authorities to conduct a detailed
asset quality review to reduce the uncertainty surrounding the quality of banks’ assets and to
work with commercial banks to increase the banking system’s efficiency, profitability, and
resilience.
Directors noted the authorities’ commitment to the pegged exchange rate regime and the current
level of the peg, which has served the country well as an effective anchor for inflation in the
context of a prudent fiscal stance and an adequate level of international reserves. At the same
time, they recognized the need to ensure external competitiveness through continued tight
demand management and structural reforms aimed at enhancing the country’s physical
infrastructure, improving the business climate, promoting diversification, raising productivity,
and boosting private investment.
It is expected that the next Article IV consultation with the Democratic Republic of São Tomé
and Príncipe will be held in accordance with the Executive Board decision on the consultation
cycle for members with Fund arrangements.

STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2016 ARTICLE IV CONSULTATION, FIRST
REVIEW UNDER THE EXTENDED CREDIT FACILITY, AND REQUEST
FOR WAIVER FOR NONOBSERVANCE OF PERFORMANCE
CRITERION AND MODIFICATION OF PERFORMANCE CRITERIA

KEY ISSUES
Context: São Tomé and Príncipe’s economic development is constrained by its insularity,
fragility, limited resources, and low capacity as a small island state. GDP growth has averaged
over 4 percent per year since 2012, faster than many small island states. Inflation has also
fallen sharply from 28 percent down to about 4 percent, the lowest in the past two decades.
These developments notwithstanding, growth has not been sufficiently strong and diversified
to meaningfully improve economic prospects and reduce poverty significantly. The poverty
rate is high at 66 percent.
Focus: Discussions centered on aligning fiscal policy to bring debt to a downward trajectory
toward a moderate risk of debt distress; addressing the liquidity overhang to enhance
monetary management; improving competitiveness; and safeguarding financial sector stability
to support growth. São Tomé and Príncipe is participating in the second round pilot of
countries to mainstream macro-financial linkages.
Review: The program is broadly on track. The authorities met all the end-December 2015
quantitative performance criteria except for marginally missing the performance criterion (PC)
on the domestic primary deficit. Some indicative targets were also missed. The government
has, however, made progress in implementing structural reforms as planned.
Staff recommends completion of the first review under the Extended Credit Facility and
modification of the indicative targets for end-September and performance criteria for endDecember 2016, and supports the authorities’ request for a waiver for nonobservance of the
end-December 2015 PC on the domestic primary deficit.
Outlook and risks: The macroeconomic outlook is favorable in the near term but challenges
remain. The main sources of short-term risks to the outlook are the forthcoming presidential
election (July 2016), with the risk of extra-budgetary spending, and continued weakness in the
banking sector. In addition, the economy will remain vulnerable to global developments,
including weak demand in the key European and emerging markets.

DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF SÃO TOMÉ AND PRÍNCIPE

CONTEXT: A STRATEGY FOR DEBT REDUCTION
AND INCLUSIVE GROWTH IN A SMALL ISLAND
FRAGILE STATE
1.
São Tomé and Príncipe’s economic development is constrained by its insularity,
fragility, limited resources, and low capacity as a small island state (Figure 1). Its export
base is undiversified and consists basically of cocoa and a nascent tourism industry that is yet
to be fully tapped. Prospects for commercial oil production dominated the government’s
political and economic narrative until the end of 2013. However, Total Oil Company
subsequently withdrew from exploration in the Joint Development Zone shared with Nigeria.1
The banking sector grew rapidly from expansion in foreign liabilities, in anticipation of
intermediating the prospective financial flows from the oil sector. However, profitability
remains weak, and loan quality has deteriorated significantly. With prospects for commercial
oil production now uncertain, implementation of the government’s infrastructure program,
initially planned to be financed by oil revenue, has stalled; the high public debt and weak
revenues limit the space for infrastructure spending to overcome constraints to development.
2.
São Tomé and Príncipe has however, made commendable progress toward
greater macroeconomic stability. GDP growth has averaged over 4 percent per year since
2012, faster than many small islands states, but not sufficiently strong and diversified to
meaningfully improve economic prospects and reduce poverty significantly. The poverty rate
is high at 66 percent. Inflation has fallen sharply from 28 percent down to 4 percent, the
lowest in the past two decades.
3.
Implementation of the 2012 National Poverty Reduction Strategy (PRSP-II) has
been a top priority but progress in achieving the Millennium Development Goals
(MDGs) was mixed. São Tomé and Príncipe achieved less than half of the MDGs (achieving
universal primary education, reducing child mortality and improving maternal health) and
came close to achieving two others (combating HIV/AIDS, malaria and other diseases and
ensuring environmental sustainability). However, the country did not achieve the goal of
eradicating extreme poverty and hunger. In its recently issued 2012–13 PRSP-II
implementation review report, the government acknowledges that the reduction in poverty
rates since 2000 has been marginal and that economic growth has fallen well short of the
sustained 6 percent annual rates considered minimum to meaningfully improve social
conditions. The PRSP-II’s implementation shortcomings are attributed primarily to lack of
financial resources, and to government instability. The government is currently working on
integrating the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) into an updated national
development strategy that will replace the PRSP-II after it ends in 2016.

There are still oil exploration activities outside the Joint Development Zone but no confirmation of
commercial quantities yet.

4.
São Tomé and Príncipe’s Article IV consultation has been delayed at the request
of the new government2. The government saw a new program as a priority and an

Banking supervision
Advice

Status

Achieved. Presently all banks have capital-to-risk-weighted asset ratio above 12 percent. T hree
Strengthen supervision and enforce prudential requirements
throughout the banking system, including the strict enforcement banks which had capital shortfall raised their capitals to the minimum required in the last quarter
of the minimum capital-to-risk-weighted asset ratio of 12 percent. of 2015, following supervisory actions.

Enforce the legal requirement that all commercial banks publish
their financial accounts to enhance transparency and facilitate
assessments of counterparty risks.

Achieved de jure but not de facto. According to BCST P all banks publish their financial accounts
regularly albeit with some delays. However, a commercial bank has complained that not all
published accounts are audited or in Portuguese, limiting their usefulness.
Financial sector restructuring

Advice

Status

Encourage banks to revisit their business plans and investment
strategies in light of more uncertain oil prospects, and to adjust
their balance sheets accordingly.

Ongoing. All commercial banks, including those that had to raise their capital recently, have been
strongly encouraged to develop new business plans consistent with the current economic reality.

Foster merger of some small banks to increase the banking
system’s efficiency and profitability, and promote financial
stability.

Partially achieved. T he number of operating commercial banks has dropped by one to seven after
one of the smallest and troubled banks was acquired by a larger bank in 2014 as a part of a
resolution process due to failure to comply with supervisory requirements.

Develop a comprehensive market strategy to deal with
nonperforming loans by: (i) conducting a realistic evaluation of
distressed assets and facilitate strict enforcement of classification
based on international norms; (ii) continuing to strengthen the
oversight of risk management practices at the commercial banks
and credit enforcement laws; and (iii) exploring options for
restructuring some of the loans.

Ongoing. This recommendation has been elevated to a structural benchmark under the ECF
supported program with a due date of end-June 2016.

Monetary policy management and competitiveness
Advice

Status

Step up efforts toward more proactive liquidity management to
including the development of an interbank market to address the
excess reserves.

Partially achieved. Interbank money market was formalized in 2015; however, not a single
transaction has taken place yet due to the perception of stigma attached to participation. BCST P is
working with the banks to overcome this challenge and to further enhance liquidity forecasting
and management.

Maintain a comfortable international reserves position, a
continuation of ongoing efforts to further diversify and expand
the export base by targeting reforms that improve the country’s
competitiveness and business climate.

Ongoing. Maintenance of a comfortable international reserve position is a key objective under the
program (a performance criterion) and the development of a national export diversification
strategy has been elevated to a structural benchmark under the program with a due date of endDecember 2016. While the international reserve coverage is just at the recommended benchmark
level, it may be desirable to build additional buffer.
Safeguards assessments

Advice

Status

Strengthen the internal audit function and coordination of the
audits by senior BCSTP management to ensure prompt remedial
actions on audit findings.

Partially achieved. T he internal audit committee was restructured and a new Director with
recognized competences was appointed. Further actions are scheduled to be completed in 2016,
including the updating of the Internal Audit Charter and establishment of a database to monitor
and prioritize audit recommendations, establishing an Audit Board policy and conducting riskbased audits of high-risk areas.

Implement formal investment policies for BCST P.

Achieved. An investment policy, together with a guideline, was adopted in 2014-15.

Box 1. Main Recommendations of the 2013 Article IV Consultation and their Current Status

DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF SÃO TOMÉ AND PRÍNCIPE

RECENT ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS, OUTLOOK
AND RISKS
5.
Delayed approval of the 2015 budget hindered performance of key
macroeconomic indicators.3 Economic activity slowed as public investment projects were
kept on hold due to the late approval of the 2015 budget. In addition, poor rains affected
crop yields, particularly, cocoa production. As a result, GDP growth in 2015 is estimated to
have fallen below the projected 5 percent by almost 1 percentage point. The end-December
2015 inflation fell below the projected 5 percent, aided by weakened demand and falling
international prices of oil and other commodities.
6.
Fiscal consolidation efforts have been hampered by tax revenue
underperformance and a mismatch between the timing of donor budget support
grants and corresponding expenditure. Tax revenue is estimated to have fallen short of the
end of year target by about 0.7 percent of GDP, in part due to a lower collection effort of tax
arrears and delayed inclusion of the 15,000 new taxpayers registered during the operation
tax inclusion project. In addition, ENCO (the oil importing company) continues to accumulate
new tax arrears (estimated at 0.3 percent of GDP) in 2015. There was also about 2.2 percent
of GDP shortfall in donor budget support grants.4 While the authorities made modest
offsetting cuts in expenditure to accommodate domestic revenue underperformance, these
were insufficient, resulting in a domestic primary deficit of about 3.0 percent of GDP, higher
than the program target of 2.7 percent of GDP.
7.
The authorities have begun implementing the domestic arrears clearance plan
agreed under the ECF-supported program. The arrears clearance plan proposes clearing
government’s outstanding arrears to the utility company (EMAE), general suppliers and to
ENCO while also preventing the accumulation of new arrears. In particular, the plan outlines
that the government would amortize all arrears to: (i) EMAE in 2015; (ii) general suppliers in
five years starting from 2015; and (iii) ENCO over 40 years with no interest charges starting
from 2016. These amortizations which add to about 1 percent of GDP on average annually
through 2020 and 0.2 percent of GDP thereafter have been incorporated into the program.
An automatic fuel price adjusted mechanism is to be introduced by end-June 2016 to
prevent the accumulation of new arrears. The plan also proposes clearing EMAE’s arrears to
ENCO over 10 years, starting in 2015. The government has already cleared all arrears to
EMAE in 2015, 1.2 percent of GDP (0.5 percent of GDP higher than budgeted). EMAE in turn
paid the equivalent of 2.6 percent of GDP of its arrears to ENCO. Despite this payment,
3

The change in government and late assumption of office by the new government delayed the approval of
the 2015 budget. The 2016 budget was however approved on time.

4

World Bank budget support grant for 2015 did not materialize due to delays by the authorities to provide
documentation on MOUs signed with China Harbor Engineering on the deepwater port project to assess
whether the terms in the MOU are consistent with the ECF-supported program.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

7

DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF SÃO TOMÉ AND PRÍNCIPE

EMAE’s arrears to ENCO in 2015 increased on net basis by 2.2 percent of GDP, albeit, by less
than initially projected under the plan. Going forward, EMAE may face difficulties in making
full payments to ENCO, in line with the plan, due to delays in reaching agreement with
investors on alternative energy sources over the purchase price of energy. Clearance of
government arrears to ENCO will start this year, and are included in the 2016 budget.
8.
The external current account deficit fell to 17 percent of GDP, reflecting weak
economic activity and contraction in oil imports that more than offset the decline in
cocoa exports. Gross international reserves, estimated at US$61 million (4.4 months of
import cover) at the end of 2015, remain at comfortable levels.
9.
There are signs that the stress in the financial system has intensified. The capital
adequacy ratio for the entire banking system fell from 20.3 percent in December 2014 to
15.5 percent at the end of 2015, while capital to risk-weighted assets ratio increased to
24.1 percent from 22.6 percent, following recent capital injections by several banks.
Moreover, non-performing loans have increased to a historic high of about 30 percent
following the reclassification of overdue overdrafts in Banco Equador’s books as bad loans
and a downgrade in a sizeable share of the largest bank’s loan classification to loss.
10.
The macroeconomic outlook is favorable in the near term but challenges
remain. GDP is projected to grow by 5 percent in 2016 aided by higher and a more timely
execution of public investments, recovery in cocoa production and increased foreign direct
investment (FDI) in the tourism sector. However, the current slowdown in credit expansion as
a result of large and rising NPLs, in particular to small enterprises, is negatively affecting
economic activities and the economic growth acceleration prospects. Inflation is expected to
remain around 4 percent on the back of falling international prices of food and petroleum
products, but still higher than the euro area inflation. Staff’s medium-term projection shows
real GDP growth falling short of the authorities’ target of 6 percent; inflation stabilizing at
3 percent; and the current account deficit contracting further.
11.
Risks are tilted to the downside (see Box 2). The forthcoming presidential election
slated for July 2016, with the risk of extra budgetary spending5, and continued weakness in
the banking sector and potential contingent claims on the budget, are the main sources of
short-term risks to the outlook. Authorities have however, expressed firm commitment to
avoid electoral spending beyond what is budgeted and are working swiftly to address
weaknesses in the banking sector including a comprehensive asset quality review and a
strategy to address the high and rising NPLs (to be implemented in June 2016).
Additional downside risks could arise from weak demand in key advanced and emerging
economies, which could dampen FDI and tourism inflows and reduce exports to those
economies. Adoption of policies that increase fiscal space would serve as a buffer.

In the past, fiscal consolidation efforts have been undermined during elections.

PROGRAM PERFORMANCE
12.
The program is broadly on track (Table 1 of MEFP attachment I). Although budget
execution was challenged due to shortfalls in tax revenue and donor budget support, all but
one end-December 2015 performance criteria (PCs) were met. The PC on domestic primary
deficit was missed by about 0.3 percent of GDP due mainly to tax revenue underperformance
and the absence of corresponding expenditure cuts. The indicative targets on tax revenue
(a floor) and on dobra money (ceiling) were missed by 0.7 percent of GDP and 16 percent
above target respectively, due mainly to slowdown in economic activities and faster-thanprogrammed accumulation of net foreign assets and net government deposits respectively.
The indicative target on pro-poor spending (floor), on the other hand, was missed marginally
(2 percent lower than target) due to oversight difficulties which will be enhanced with the
expansion of the electronic information management system (SAFEe) to all ministries and
10

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF SÃO TOMÉ AND PRÍNCIPE

government agencies. Corrective measures to address tax revenue under-performance have
been introduced (see ¶ 20 and MEFP ¶ 12 and 13).
13.
The government has made progress in implementing structural reforms as
planned (Table 2 of MEFP attachment I). In particular, the new bank resolution law was
submitted to the National Assembly6, and the two structural benchmarks related to
improvements in the national accounts and consumer price statistics were also implemented.
The policy resolve and commitment demonstrated so far are still needed, especially in an
election year, to maintain momentum, and importantly, bring the benefits of reform and
sacrifices made thus far to a broader segment of the population.

POLICY DISCUSSIONS
14.
Policy discussions focused on addressing critical medium-term challenges.
Emphasis was placed on aligning fiscal policy to ensure a decline in the debt trajectory over
the medium term while creating space for growth-enhancing and social spending;
addressing the liquidity overhang to enhance monetary management; improving
competitiveness and setting the stage for higher sustainable and inclusive growth; and
enhancing the role of macro-financial linkages to improve financial stability and support
economic growth.

A. Staying the Course on Debt Reduction while Improving the Quality
of Spending
15.
Debt vulnerabilities remain high. The updated debt sustainability analysis (DSA),
which reflects lower upfront borrowing and disbursements in 2015, still shows that São Tomé
and Príncipe remains at high risk of debt distress, after receiving HIPC debt relief in 2007.
With challenges in budget execution in 2015, stronger implementation effort and oversight is
required in order to maintain the deficit target path in the program, which is consistent with
the available non-debt creating financing—aimed at bringing debt toward a moderate risk of
debt distress.
16.
São Tomé and Príncipe has outstanding arrears to non-Paris Club creditors—
Angola and the People’s Republic of China. These arrears predate the HIPC completion
point and amount to US$53 million at end-2015. They are the only debt obligations to these
creditors and there is no other debt service falling due on them.
17.
In past Fund programs, these arrears have been deemed away, reflecting the
HIPC agreement and the best efforts of the São Tomé and Príncipe authorities to resolve the
arrears to non-Paris Club creditors. The authorities have approached non-Paris Club creditors
6

The law was subsequently passed by the National Assembly and gazetted.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

11

DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF SÃO TOMÉ AND PRÍNCIPE

in order to negotiate debt relief on comparable terms but no bilateral agreement has been
reached so far.
18.
The staff assesses that the arrears can continue to be deemed away under the
revised lending-into-official arrears policy approved by the Board in December 2015.
Under the new policy the arrears can be deemed away if the underlying Paris Club
agreement is assessed to be adequately representative, i.e., if Paris Club creditors provide the
majority of the financing contributions required from official bilateral creditors. In the case of
São Tomé and Príncipe, the Paris Club creditors’ share of required contributions from official
bilateral creditors amounted to about 52 percent and hence can be considered
representative for the purposes of the new policy. Even though the deadline set out in the
Paris Club agreed minutes to conclude bilateral agreements with non-Paris Club creditors has
passed, staff assesses that the São Tomé and Príncipe authorities have since continued
making best efforts to conclude the agreements with Angola and the People’s Republic of
China. As under the old policy, staff will continue to revisit this assessment at each review, to
make a judgment about whether the authorities continue to make best efforts to resolve the
arrears.
19.
The authorities share staff’s recommendation to anchor medium-term fiscal
policy on bringing debt to a downward trajectory toward a moderate risk of debt
distress. At the heart of achieving this objective is sustained adjustment to the domestic
primary deficit (MEFP attachment I ¶ 11). Experience across smaller countries offers support
to the policy of reducing debt by reducing the domestic primary deficit through boosting tax
revenues and containing discretionary expenditure. Such an effort will require a significant
social and political commitment over the course of several years. The authorities confirmed
their determination to a medium-term domestic primary deficit of 1–1½ percent of GDP.
Consistent with the above, the projected domestic primary deficit target of 2 percent of GDP,
in the 2016 budget, is in line with the program. The sharp increase in the overall fiscal deficit
in 2016 is due to higher capital spending financed mostly from planned privatization
proceeds from government’s shares in the largest bank and the telecom company and from
disbursements of already contracted project loans and previously programmed new
concessional loans from Kuwait and Turkey. The increase in the overall fiscal deficit, as a
result of increased capital spending, does not affect the program debt trajectory. It however,
helps to offset the negative impact of the slowdown in tourism and stressed financial sector
on growth, thereby maintaining the medium-term growth path originally envisaged under
the program. The authorities agreed to staff’s recommendation to stand ready to make
timely offsetting cuts in primary domestic expenditure while safeguarding pro-poor spending
should the full amount of expected budget support fail to materialize, but noted that given
the very rigid expenditure profile, any shortfall in budget support could result in some cuts in
social spending.

20.
Accelerating improvements in revenue collection should be an integral part of
the medium-term fiscal policy strategy (MEFP attachment I ¶ 12). The goal is to increase
tax revenue collection to the levels of

curb fraud and tax evasion through
greater, more rigorous, and regular audits, improving the capacity and incentives at the large
taxpayer unit, increasing the number of products subject to imposition of minimum custom
value, and introducing a number of legislative changes, including lowering the minimum
taxable income, raising the minimum presumptive levy charged to individuals and firms, and
transferring the execution powers for collection of tax arrears from the fiscal court judge to
the tax administration (end-June 2016 structural benchmark).
21.
The government has delayed the introduction of value added tax (VAT) beyond
2017 (MEFP attachment I ¶ 12). While VAT introduction would significantly widen the tax
base and enhance domestic revenue collection, staff welcomes the government’s decision to
shift the introduction to 2018 to allow for more comprehensive preparatory work, including
the drafting and passing of the VAT law, the tax policy design, introduction of revenue
administration structures to support the implementation of VAT, training of staff, and a
public education campaign (Box 3). The IMF and other partners (including the AfDB) are
providing the necessary assistance. The current program does not yet assume the revenue
impact of the introduction of VAT.
22.
On the spending side, the authorities are placing emphasis on strengthening
public financial management and transparency (MEFP attachment I ¶ 14). The main goal is
to ensure efficiency in public expenditure. Although the authorities have taken some initial
steps to improve its information management system and data analysis capacities, swift
implementation of further measures is critical. Specific measures will include rolling out of
SAFEe from the current pilot stage to cover all ministries, autonomous services, other
sovereign institutions, regional and local government to strengthen public financial
oversight. The authorities are considering enhancing SAFEe with added functionality such as
reconciliation of treasury bank accounts, revenue tracking, management of fixed assets and a
government contracts registry to facilitate the preparation of more comprehensive general
government accounts. In addition, the authorities intend to move towards medium-term
fiscal and expenditure frameworks in 2017.
INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF SÃO TOMÉ AND PRÍNCIPE

Box 3. Conditions for Success of Value Added Tax in São Tomé and Príncipe
Broad legislative reform. The introduction of VAT should be conceived as part of a broader reform plan of
indirect taxation (introduction of excise consumption tax, revision of the customs tariff). Changes in income
tax legislation will be necessary to maintain the coherence in the tax system (for example, harmonization of
thresholds subject to the real regime).
With regard to the VAT legislation specifically, the experience of countries that have adopted this tax in
recent years points to the following best practices: (i) a broad tax base with a fairly small number of
exemptions to ensure good performance of the tax and prevent economic distortions created by tax
incentives; (ii) a single rate to simplify the tax system and facilitate administration, reduce compliance costs
of taxpayers' obligations and minimize the risk of evasion; (iii) adoption of a zero rate applied only to
exports; and a relatively high application threshold to eliminate incidence on small operators, reduce the
number of collectors and facilitate management of the tax by the tax administration. The use of a single
threshold for all companies, whatever their legal form, is a good practice.
Preparation of tax administration. Apart from the quality of the VAT law, the successful introduction of
the tax depends critically on the capacity of the tax and customs administrations to administer it. The launch
of VAT project is not recommended before the tax administration is properly prepared. In the current stage,
the tax directorate needs both an organizational restructuring and deep reforms to strengthen the tax
administration. There is a need to adopt a functional organization in line with modern tax administrations,
where central services are dedicated primarily to supporting task, steering, coordinating, monitoring and
evaluating the activities of operational services. The new organization should also include proper
segmentation of taxpayers, an internal audit function to prevent moral hazard, and an enhanced tax
enforcement function. Beyond organizational restructuring, there is an urgent need to strengthen the tax
administration in the following areas: (i) developing human capacity; (ii) improving working conditions and
(iii) strengthening fiscal operations, including needs for more dynamic and secured management of a
taxpayer database, management of taxpayer files based on risk analysis that reflects strong concentration of
revenue in a small number of taxpayers, and reorienting inspection activity towards broadening the tax base
and imposing fines on tax evasion, and adopting a computer application with basic functionality such as
automatic notification of defaulting taxpayers and the extraction of statistics and support for oversight and
improved education of taxpayers and services to users. A premature launch of the VAT would exacerbate the
existing obstacles and could lead to failure of the project. In 2016, efforts should be concentrated on
measures to strengthen fiscal operations to continue to ensure the mobilization of fiscal resources.

23.
The authorities are going ahead with the introduction of an automatic fuel price
adjustment mechanism, taking advantage of the current low international crude oil
price environment (MEFP attachment I ¶ 13). This will ensure full cost recovery, prevent the
accumulation of new domestic arrears to ENCO and reduce pressure on the budget.
The government has committed to use the initial positive price differential at the time of the
introduction of the automatic fuel price mechanism to partially lower prices at the pump
while the rest of the differential will be locked in by raising the surcharge rates on fuel, and
using the proceeds to accelerate arrears reduction to ENCO.
24.
The government has identified key growth-enhancing infrastructure spending
needed to increase growth to around 6 percent—the minimum required to significantly
impact poverty. Some of these key projects are: the deepwater port project for which the

14

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF SÃO TOMÉ AND PRÍNCIPE

government has already signed MOUs7 (about US$800 million) with China Harbor
Engineering Company to design a PPP with financing from the private sector; the extension
of the airport runway in São Tomé; and the development of alternative sources of cheaper
energy (other than thermal). Staff welcomes the authorities’ decision to focus on the
extension of the airport runway and alternative sources of energy, and only embark on the
deepwater port project if a careful and comprehensive feasibility study establishes its
economic viability and also if it is entirely private sector financed without government
contingent liabilities.
25.
A successful implementation of the infrastructure program depends critically on
implementing the existing debt framework law and strengthening debt management
capacity (MEFP attachment I ¶ 17). This will involve policy actions that include the
preparation of a national debt strategy that fixes a ceiling on the overall debt of the nonfinancial public sector and annual debt policies that fix annual ceilings for each public entity.
The government plans to carry out a new debt management performance assessment
(DeMPA) by end-December 2016 with the support of development partners. This will
highlight areas of focus for improvements. Enhanced capacity for debt management will be
anchored on an updated medium-term debt management strategy, a manual of procedures
for debt management, a computer-based debt management system and staff training.
Also, the government has prepared a comprehensive draft public private partnership (PPP)
law and framework to guide the growing expressions of interests for PPPs following the
London investors’ conference in October 2015. The PPP law is expected to be finalized by
end-September 2016.
26.
This should be backed by enhanced investment management capacity
(MEFP attachment I ¶ 16). The government’s fairly low project execution ratio suggests a
need for improving capacity in project implementation and evaluation and gradually scaling
up capital expenditure to ensure that the authorities have adequate time to build their
technical expertise. Staff urged the authorities to introduce: (i) a centralized framework for
appraising and prioritizing capital expenditure projects and (ii) a public investment
management assessment (PIMA) framework and associated implementation plan
(end-December 2016). This should help reconcile competing funding demands with available
resources while ensuring consistency with the government’s policies and objectives.
27.
The authorities agreed with the risks flagged by the updated DSA. There was
general recognition of these vulnerabilities and there is an ongoing effort to mitigate them
through the range of fiscal reforms discussed above, including efforts at strengthening debt
management and improving debt recording and monitoring. The authorities are committed
to continuing to prioritize grants and focus on priority projects financed by concessional
loans. The authorities have also prepared a borrowing plan (MEFP ¶ 18, MEFP Text Table 1)
including sources and uses of the planned financing.

7

Staff’s view, after reviewing the existing MOUs, is that there were no liabilities that are not contingent on
further negotiations/agreement by the government, and that the MOUs as they stood, did not breach the PC
on nonconcessional borrowing.

B. Addressing Liquidity Overhang to Enhance Monetary Management
28.
The large and growing excess liquidity is undermining the authorities’ effort at
monetary management. Excess liquidity was estimated at 24 percent of deposits or about
5 percent of GDP at the end of 2015. It is distributed asymmetrically among banks, with the
bulk concentrated in the largest bank, while a couple of banks struggle to meet the minimum
required reserve levels. Excess liquidity has built up mainly from net inflows of external
resources, and its persistence suggests that involuntary excess liquidity is more than a
temporary deviation away from the optimal structure of commercial banks’ balance sheets.
While current headline inflation is in line with the authorities’ target of keeping inflation
around 4 percent in 2016 and declining further to 3 percent over the medium term, there are
risks of elevating underlying inflationary pressures coming from growing excess liquidity
which could fuel aggregate demand pressures.
29.
Staff underscored the need to further refine the liquidity forecasting and
management tools (MEFP attachment I ¶ 18–19). The current forecasting tools allow for
improved information gathering and better analysis of the autonomous factors that drive
liquidity. However, forecasting errors (though reduced) still hamper an accurate assessment
of the liquidity needs of the banking system; further minimizing these errors and determining
banks’ needs would inform the timing and quantum of issuance of new treasury bills and
bonds in the nascent money market. Moreover, the recently-introduced interbank money
market has not generated the required participation by banks due to perceptions of stigma,
while the successful introduction of government treasury bills in June 2015 and the doubling
of the amount on offer to about 2 percent of GDP this year, though bold, are insufficient to
address the liquidity overhang. The implementation of the strategy to address the large and
growing NPLs (¶ 38), further development of the financial infrastructure (¶ 37), and reforms to
improve the business environment (¶ 41 and 42) will encourage commercial banks to start
lending on the margins to reduce involuntary reserves in an environment of positive real
interest rates.
30.
The BCSTP believes the lack of participation by banks in the interbank money
market is only temporary given recent developments in the domestic financial market.
The BCSTP is working with banks to address these challenges while at the same time
improving the functioning of the government securities market—creating the conditions for
longer-term liquidity management—as well as developing the secondary market.

C. Macro-Financial Linkages and Financial Sector Stability
31.
Prospects for commercial oil production increased the size of the banking
sector significantly. The financial sector is highly-concentrated and characterized by excess
liquidity and low profitability (SIP section II). One large bank accounts for about half of the
system’s deposits and loans; six small banks account for the other half (Figure 4). Total assets
of the banking system increased from 25.9 percent of GDP in 2001 to 86.8 percent of GDP by
2012 before falling to 79.9 percent of GDP in 2015. Foreign currency denominated deposits
16

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF SÃO TOMÉ AND PRÍNCIPE

and loans have been trending downward since the introduction of the peg to the euro in
2010, but remain high and subject to risks of capital flight in the absence of appropriate
prudential measures. The number of banks also increased from 1 in 2001 to 7 by 2015, all in
anticipation of increased economic activity in relation to commercial oil production.
32.
Indicators of profitability remain weak, amidst high operating cost and weak
demand for loans, with only the largest bank remaining profitable while other banks
face negative (some highly) returns on assets. Return on equity has also been
deteriorating and was estimated at -27 percent in 2015, eroding the capital base of some
banks. However, the central bank’s intervention and corrective measures are beginning to
yield results. Three out of seven banks have increased their capital to the minimum required
level. BCSTP is moving—under the new bank resolution law which provides the necessary
legal framework for swift and orderly resolution of banks—to create a transition bank as a
first step toward resolving Banco Equador which has been under administration over the past
year. The BCSTP has now introduced a regulatory framework on bridge banks, based on the
recently passed banking resolution law, to help guide any potential resolution and
restructuring of banks, including private sector solutions.
33.
The quality of banks’ aggregated loan book deteriorated significantly since the
last Article IV in 2013. The asset quality of most banks has been weakening as reflected in
increasing NPLs, and presents significant vulnerabilities as well as hindering financial
intermediation (Figure 5 and SIP section II). The ratio of NPLs to total loans almost doubled
from around 16 percent to about 30 percent. This increase in NPLs was driven by
substandard and loss loans, which indicates further deterioration in asset quality. As a result,
the BCSTP has demanded increases in provisioning (doubling it in the last year alone).
Bank-by-bank NPLs show a worrying picture, with only one bank with an NPL ratio of less
than 10 percent. Two banks have NPLs close to 50 percent while the remaining banks have
NPLs ranging between 20 and 30 percent, reflecting similar trends in other small financial
systems (SIP section IV).8
34.
Staff stressed the urgent need for a comprehensive strategy to address the
large stock of NPLs in the banking system and the introduction of a contingency plan
to deal with potential fiscal risks. The NPL strategy, among other things, should also look
at reforming the debt enforcement and insolvency regimes, introducing out-of-court
workout that aims at rehabilitating viable debtors, and measures to improve the operational
capacity of banks to work out NPLs. This should be backed by a more detailed asset quality
review (AQR) involving stocktaking, review of provisioning requirements, in-depth
examination of banks’ large exposure, and where necessary, recapitalization of affected
banks to reduce the uncertainty currently surrounding the quality of assets carried by banks.
This will also require appropriate measures at the bank level (e.g., addressing weak
8

The domestic arrears is mainly due to the oil importing company and the electricity generating company,
and does not significantly affect suppliers nor contribute to the large and rising NPLs.

underwriting standards including improvements in credit policies and governance) and
beefing up risked-based supervision to minimize spillovers from the banking sector to the
rest of the economy. Enhancing both on- and off-site supervision, tightening and enforcing
prudential norms are critical to containing credit risk. The authorities are strongly urged to
use all legal tools available (including the recently passed banking resolution law), combined
with private sector solutions (backed by the new regulation on bridge banks) to address any
vulnerabilities identified during the comprehensive AQR, and where necessary, set up a
contingency plan in subsequent budgets to address any residual fiscal risk.
35.
Linkages between developments in the financial sector and the overall economy
are bi-directional (Figure 3 and SIP section II). Continued vigilance over the financial sector
is warranted given the adverse impacts of macro-related risks on the financial sector and the
negative spillback to the real economy. More recently, the lack of dynamism in the real
economy, following the declining prospects for commercial oil production, has constrained
credit expansion as banks struggle to find new businesses. This has impacted negatively on
banks’ balance sheet and profitability. The BCSTP has had to intervene in 3 banks in the last
3 years, with one bank currently under administration. A potential resolution of the bank
under administration, if new shareholders are not identified, could induce a cost of about
4 percent of GDP to the budget. There is also a negative feedback from the current
slowdown in credit expansion, in particular to small enterprises, on economic activities and
the economic growth acceleration prospects, with already tangible negative impact on
domestic revenue mobilization—frustrating the authorities’ drive to raise domestic resources
to supplement the financing of the government’s infrastructure project. There is also a
negative spillover from the slowdown in domestic capital expenditure implementation
(weak public sector demand) on the financial sector—mainly the significant reduction in loan
demands from government contractors and the subsequent rising loan default rates
(SIP section II).
36.
Macro stress tests highlight credit risk as the most relevant given the limited
debt instruments, excess liquidity, and currency peg. In addition, large exposure to few
borrowers exposes banks to concentration risk. A default of about three large borrowers will
lead to a system-wide drop in capital adequacy ratio (CAR) below the minimum required
(SIP section II). Overall, the stress test results show that banks in São Tomé and Príncipe are
vulnerable to shocks simulated and give some indication that the industry’s overall
capitalization could be undermined should these shocks materialize.

37.
Access to financial services needs to be broadened to the unbanked segments
of the population, including SMEs (SIP section II). Credit delivery to these under-served
sectors has been hampered by the lack of collateral, poor enforcement when available and
information asymmetry in the banking system. This has made base lending rates sticky
downwards and cut off segments of the population from gaining access to financial services.
To resolve this problem, reforms are needed to lower operational costs, increase competition,
and enhance business practices by SMEs, in particular: (i) improving the coverage and
effectiveness of the credit reference bureaus; (ii) streamlining procedures to ensure collateral
enforcement, including reforms to the judiciary; and (iii) training SMEs in basic accounting,
financial management, and preparation of bankable projects.
38.
The BCSTP shared staff’s recommendation to swiftly address weaknesses in the
financial system in order to support private sector development and promote financial
inclusion. The authorities are moving quickly to produce a comprehensive strategy for the
resolution of the large stock of NPLs (structural benchmark June 2016) backed by a detailed
AQR. In addition, the authorities have initiated processes (with the help of development
partners) to address structural bottlenecks in the economy, including a comprehensive review
of the judiciary to restore confidence in contract enforcement by reducing the lengthy court
resolution of default cases, backed by a review of the collateral processes.

D. Improving Competitiveness and Setting the Stage for Higher
Sustainable and Inclusive Growth
39.
Achieving economic diversification and inclusive growth remains a challenge.
The broad outlines of the government’s 2030 Transformation Agenda identify the priorities
for medium to long-term growth, social cohesion and external credibility, including most
notably diversifying the economy, broadening the production base and modernizing the
economic and social infrastructure. While the services sector has driven growth historically,
São Tomé and Príncipe’s tourism potential is yet to be tapped (MEFP attachment I ¶ 21).
The way forward is for São Tomé and Príncipe to focus on high value-added tourism
activities, broader diversification of source markets, and more open, competitive air transport
connections, including direct links to the neighboring countries in the sub region, Europe,
and Brazil (SIP section I). This would require further work on the existing airport to extend the
runway to accommodate larger aircrafts, including chartered aircrafts.
40.
There should also be targeted efforts to support the traditional sectors
(agriculture and fisheries) to boost job creation and reduce poverty. While still
accounting for a sizable share of employment, the combined share of agriculture and
fisheries in real GDP has been declining and their contribution to growth has been
meager—a trend that has to be reversed.
41.
Staff assesses the real effective exchange rate (REER) as moderately over-valued
in 2015 (Annex I). Addressing this would require further diversifying the economy and
exports beyond the traditional sectors through targeted actions to improve the business
environment to attract FDI. The low level of competitiveness remains a challenge to
economic diversification and inclusive growth. Indicators of doing business are lagging
behind the average for sub-Saharan Africa and other small states based on the 2016 World
Bank Doing Business survey. While some progress was made in some areas—the indicator
measuring starting a business topped the rankings in the region—special attention is needed
in the areas where the country ranks in the bottom quarter in the region: getting electricity,
registering property, access to credit, protecting minority investors, and paying taxes.
Some large infrastructure projects, for example, in electricity generation, the airport, and the
existing port, could significantly enhance doing business and make São Tomé and Príncipe
one of the preferred tourist destinations in the region. Staff welcomes the authorities’ effort
to put together a national export diversification strategy by the end of December 2016.
42.
The authorities agreed with staff’s assessment of the level of the exchange rate.
They stressed their commitment to the pegged exchange rate regime and the current level of
the peg, which has served them well as an effective anchor for inflation. To ensure external
competitiveness, they recognize that it needs to be supported by continued tight demand
management and structural reforms designed to raise productivity and boost private
investment. The authorities also agree with the need for diversification and enhancing the
competitiveness of traditional sectors to promote sustained and broad-based and shared
growth. For example, in agriculture, the authorities are prioritizing access to credit by small
22

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF SÃO TOMÉ AND PRÍNCIPE

farmers as a way to reclaim lost grounds in cocoa and coffee production, with the goal of, at
least, doubling cocoa production and exports by 2020.

PROGRAM ISSUES, SAFEGUARDS AND RISKS
43.
The end-December 2015 PC on the domestic primary deficit was missed by a
small margin (0.3 percent of GDP) and staff supports corrective measures introduced
by the authorities to address this slippage. Staff agrees with the introduction of
legislations to lower the minimum taxable income, raise the minimum presumptive levy
charged to individuals and firms, and transfer the execution powers for collection of tax
arrears from the fiscal court judge to the tax administration unit (¶ 20) aimed at boosting tax
collection. Staff also supports corrective measures introduced by the authorities to address
the missed indicative targets on the floor of pro-poor spending (¶ 12) and the ceiling on
dobra money.
44.
Program monitoring. All PCs and indicative targets for the first half of 2016 remain
the same as approved by the Executive Board. Staff and the authorities have however, agreed
to propose a modification to the PCs on the domestic primary deficit and net international
reserves (while staff proposes to modify the two PCs slightly, they remain the same in
percent of GDP and in terms of months of imports respectively) and indicative targets on tax
revenue and base money in the second half of 2016 to align with the pace of reforms in
revenue administration and faster-than-programmed accumulation of net foreign assets and
net government deposits in 2015 (Table 3 of MEFP attachment I). Four new structural
benchmarks for 2016 have been proposed covering a change in tax administration
legislation, a public investment management assessment (PIMA) and the associated
implementation plan, VAT law, and establishment of an Audit Board policy at BCSTP (Table 4
of MEFP attachment I). The second review is expected to be completed by December 2016,
the third review by June 2017, and the fourth review by December 2017.
45.
The program is fully financed and staff’s assessment of São Tomé and Príncipe’s
capacity to repay the Fund remains broadly unchanged from the ECF arrangement
request (Table 11). São Tomé and Príncipe’s capacity to repay the Fund remains strong, as
obligations remain small relative to exports and reserves.
46.
An updated safeguards assessment, completed in February 2016, found that
severe capacity constraints contributed to a weak safeguards framework at the central
bank. In particular, independent oversight on audit and control mechanisms was lacking and
the BCSTP law needs to be amended to strengthen the autonomy of the central bank.
In addition, to strengthen independent oversight on the bank’s operations, the BCSTP should
establish an Audit Board Policy that includes roles and responsibilities similar to a
conventional audit committee (end-December 2016 structural benchmark), and identify a
qualified external expert to assist the Audit Board. Reforms to the BCSTP law, currently
underway, should be done in consultation with the Fund.
INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

23

DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF SÃO TOMÉ AND PRÍNCIPE

47.
Risks to the program are high. Apart from slower growth than envisaged, financial
sector vulnerabilities could become more pressing, risks to reform commitment in a
presidential election year could crystallize and weak capacity could constrain program
implementation. Continued technical assistance particularly in banking supervision, PFM and
tax administration and policy would in part mitigate risks related to capacity.

OTHER SURVEILLANCE ISSUES
48.
Although the provision of economic data has some shortcomings, it is broadly
adequate for surveillance. There is ample scope to improve the balance of payments
statistics, which are being revised with the help of STA TA. INE has completed the rebasing of
the national accounts to 2008 (as opposed to 2001) and a new CPI, reflecting price
movements in a broader basket of goods and services and using 2014 (instead of 1996) as
the base year. The next steps include improving GDP statistics by developing data on the
components of GDP on the demand side, strengthening trade statistics, and extending
coverage of the international investment position.
49.
Exchange System and Exchange Rate Arrangement. São Tomé and Príncipe
continues to avail itself of the transitional arrangements under Article XIV, but does not
maintain restrictions under Article XIV. However, it maintains one exchange restriction
subject to Fund approval under Article VIII. The authorities should work towards removing
the existing exchange restriction, which arises from Article 3 (i) and Article 10.1 (b) of the
Investment Code (Law No. 7/2008) regarding limitations on the transferability of net income
from investments. The country’s exchange rate arrangement is, since 2010, a de facto fixed
peg to the euro. The exchange system is free of multiple currency practices.

STAFF APPRAISAL
50.
The strong progress in implementation of structural reforms needs to be
maintained to bring the full benefits of reforms to a broader segment of the
population. Staff welcomes the authorities’ continued commitment to program
implementation and supports the corrective measures introduced to boost domestic revenue
mobilization (¶ 20 and 43). Measures are to be introduced by the end of 2016 to ensure
proper monitoring of pro-poor spending, i.e., expansion of the electronic information
management system (SAFEe) to all ministries and government agencies (¶ 12) and dobra
money.
51.
Staff also welcomes the authorities’ resolve to maintain the strong mediumterm fiscal adjustment to bring down debt toward a moderate risk of debt distress.
The continued underperformance of tax revenue calls for steadfast implementation of
identified revenue administration measures and introduction of legislations to address
weaknesses in collection of tax arrears and to bring on board the identified 15,000 new tax
payers to support the medium-term objective of bringing the domestic primary deficit down
24

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF SÃO TOMÉ AND PRÍNCIPE

to 1–1½ percent of GDP. This would have to be complemented by enhancing the growth
impact of public investment spending, including structured and centralized investment
planning, prioritization, and budgeting, to ensure fiscal policy supports the overriding
objective of debt sustainability, by walking a fine line between debt reduction and scaling up
of the needed growth-enhancing spending.
52.
Strengthening debt management capacity while continuing to rely on grants
and concessional loans is at the core of the debt reduction program. Staff welcomes the
authorities’ decision to prepare a national debt strategy that fixes a ceiling on the overall
debt of the non-financial public sector, updates the medium-term debt management
strategy, and prepares guidelines on debt management. The authorities are therefore
encouraged to conduct a new debt management performance assessment (DeMPA) to set
the basis for the new debt management strategy and also to finalize the draft public private
partnership (PPP) law and framework to guide the government’s public investment program
given the increased expressions of interests following the successful investor’s conference in
London, in October 2015.
53.
The timing is right to implement the automatic fuel pricing mechanism as
planned. Addressing the high stock of domestic arrears needs to be backed by a
comprehensive reform to the government’s fuel subsidy program to prevent future
accumulation of arrears. The current low international crude oil price presents the right
environment to introduce this key reform to further strengthen the authorities’ fiscal
consolidation efforts.
54.
Staff welcomes the BCSTP’s efforts at enhancing liquidity management, and
also notes that challenges remain. While the liquidity forecasting tool introduced so far
allows for improved information gathering and a more accurate analysis of the autonomous
factors that drive liquidity, it needs further refining to minimize forecasting errors, due to
poor information sharing on treasury spending, to better support BCSTP’s liquidity
management operations. Staff strongly recommends that the BCSTP leads the effort to
address banks’ transparency concerns and perceived stigma associated with accessing the
interbank market in order to boost participation.
55.
Vulnerabilities within the financial system need to be swiftly addressed. There is
evidence of bi-directional linkages between the financial sector and the real, fiscal, and
external sectors of the economy. The lack of dynamism in the real economy has impacted
banks’ ability to lend, resulting in large and fast build-up of excess liquidity in the banking
system, with a negative feedback loop to the real and fiscal sectors of the economy.
These have jointly resulted in a sharp and sustained increase in NPLs and raised the risk of
potential cost to the budget should some of the existing weak and unprofitable banks
require restructuring. The BCSTP should immediately develop a strategy to address the large
stock of NPLs, and where necessary, review provisioning practices and minimum capital
requirements to ensure banks are well capitalized. This should be backed by a detailed AQR
to reduce the uncertainty currently surrounding the quality of assets carried by banks and
INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

25

DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF SÃO TOMÉ AND PRÍNCIPE

further safeguard the stability of the financial system. Once the comprehensive AQR is
completed, the BCSTP should use all legal tools available (including private sector solutions)
to address any vulnerabilities identified, and if required, set up a contingency plan in
subsequent budgets to address any residual fiscal risk.
56.
In light of the broadly satisfactory program implementation so far and the
authorities’ commitment to maintaining the momentum, staff supports the completion
of the first review under the ECF arrangement. Staff recommends a waiver for the
nonobservance of the PC on the floor of domestic primary deficit based on corrective
measures committed by the authorities (¶ 20 and 43) and also supports the proposed
establishment and modification of PCs, indicative targets, structural benchmarks for 2016,
and the request to combine the two continuous PCs on non-concessional external
borrowing. Staff also supports the second disbursement in the amount of SDR 634,285.
57.
It is proposed that the next Article IV Consultation be held on a 24-month cycle,
in accordance with the Decision on Article IV Consultation Cycles (Decision No. 14747(10/96), as amended).

Annex I. External Balance Assessment
São Tomé and Príncipe’s external position is moderately weak and vulnerable owing to the
country’s narrow export base. Staff analysis suggests that the immediate risks to the external
position appear manageable. In particular, the real effective exchange rate is assessed as
moderately overvalued on current policy and the international reserves are adequate compared
to the traditional and IMF Low Income Country (LIC) reserve metrics, especially when the extra
buffers of the balance of the National Oil Account (NOA) and contingent credit line with
Portugal are considered. However, medium-term vulnerabilities remain significant and need to
be addressed through continued fiscal consolidation and structural reform to support
diversification and enhance the competitiveness of the economy.

A. Evolution of the Balance of Payments
1.
São Tomé and Príncipe’s external position is moderately weak and vulnerable
owing to the country’s narrow export base. The external account balance has been
worsening since the HIPC debt relief, reflecting both a trend decrease in the current account
and limited capital and financial inflow1. Current account trends have been dominated by the
gradual contraction in the trade deficit in line with weaker activities and driven more recently
by lower international prices of oil and other commodities. Capital and financial accounts
have registered declining surplus and have been dominated by foreign aid, FDI and public
sector borrowing. The external debt has increased reflecting a shift in the composition of
sources of financing of the current account deficit, with a declining role of FDI and rising
share of debt creating flows. Going forward, the external position and the current account
are expected to improve, supported by planned fiscal consolidation, further import
compression due to lower commodity prices and expected pick up in exports. However,
medium-term vulnerabilities remain significant and need to be addressed through continued
fiscal consolidation and structural reform to support diversification and enhance
competitiveness of the economy.

1

São Tomé and Príncipe’s balance of payments (BOP) statistics have some shortcomings, reflected in the
very large Net Errors and Omissions (NEO), especially in recent years (2013–14). The signs of the recent NEOs
suggest that on balance, credits (and net incurrence of liabilities) have been underestimated, or debits
(and net acquisitions of financial assets) have been overestimated, or a combination of both. This masks the
underlying magnitudes of the BOP aggregates.

B. Exchange Rate Assessment
2.
São Tomé and Príncipe’s real effective exchange rate (REER) has appreciated
considerably since the introduction of the peg to the euro in January 2010. Since then,
there has been a gradual disinflation process which has been too slow in closing the inflation
differential with trading partners. As a result, the REER exhibits a more pronounced trend
appreciation compared to that of countries with similar exports (Figure 2, right chart).

3.
EBA-lite model-based indicators of REER suggest that, on current policies, the
2015 level of real effective exchange rate ranges from slightly undervalued to strongly
overvalued (Table 1). However, the results should be interpreted with caution given the
inherent difficulties in benchmarking external stability for a fragile and small country with
severe data limitations like São Tomé and Príncipe.



The EBA-lite current account model relating the current account to policy and
non-policy fundamentals predicts a modest overvaluation (Figure 3). The model
fits reasonably well. It predicts a current account norm of -8.9 percent of GDP, net of
a policy gap of -2 percent of GDP (or the sum of deviations of São Tomé and
Príncipe’s actual fiscal balance, change in reserves and private sector credit from their
optimal levels and the world’s averages of the same policy variables from their
optimal levels). With the observed 2015 current account at -16.7 percent of GDP, it
implies a current account gap of -7.9 percent of GDP or a modest overvaluation of
the REER of about 7.5 percent assuming an elasticity of current account to REER of
-1.05.



The EBA-lite EREER model predicts a stronger REER overvaluation
(33.4 percent). However, like its predecessor equilibrium real exchange rate
INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

41

DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF SÃO TOMÉ AND PRÍNCIPE

approach under CGER methodologies, the Index REER model is not adequate for
economies with major structural changes or limited data. The model is not a good fit
for São Tomé and Príncipe. It provides an unreliable account of the REER
developments over the last 5 years due to difficulties in capturing important
structural changes such as the introduction of the peg with euro in 2010 and the
subsequent slow disinflation dynamics (see the middle chart of the panel Figure 3).
As such, the result should be interpreted with caution.


On the other hand, the external sustainability approach shows that the REER is
slightly undervalued. Targeting a net IIP at its most recent historical level
(-153.2 percent of GDP) entails a current account norm of -13.5 percent which in turn
implies an undervaluation of (-6.9 percent) based on an underlying current account
of -6.2 percent and an elasticity of current account to REER of -1.05. Reducing the net
IIP target to (-127.4 percent of GDP), a level consistent with the current account norm
from EBA-lite CA model, results in a slightly less undervalued REER (-4 to -5 percent)
or broadly consistent with the fundamentals (see the bottom chart of the panel
Figure 3).

4.
Staff bottom line assessment is that the dobra REER in 2015 is modestly
overvalued. The assessment is in line with the EBA-lite CA model prediction, which shows
the most reliable fit to São Tomé and Príncipe’s case. The EBA-lite EREER model is not a good
fit because of a significant structural change (i.e. dobra peg to the euro since 2010) and
limited data while the predictions of the external sustainability approach are less reliable
given the inherent difficulties in benchmarking the appropriate level of the net IIP.
5.
São Tomé and Príncipe’s pegged exchange rate regime has served the country
well by ending the inflation-depreciation cycle. Correcting external imbalance through
nominal depreciation is unlikely to deliver a more depreciated REER in the medium term
because of the high pass-through to domestic prices. Policies to address external imbalances
will have to focus on increasing savings through fiscal consolidation and fostering
competitiveness (see section D of this annex).

D. Non-price Competitiveness Assessment
8.
Non-price competitiveness indicators all point to some loss of competitiveness.
While São Tomé and Príncipe’s market share for tourism showed a strong rebound in 2014,
reversing the decline caused by the crisis in Europe, its market share for cocoa has generally
been declining in recent years, signaling loss of competitiveness. The 2016 World Bank’s
Doing Business survey also suggests more vigorous reform actions are needed to improve
the business environment. It shows only a modest improvement in São Tomé and Príncipe’s
overall distance to the top reformers at the frontier over the last six years. The country is
lagging relative to the average for sub-Saharan Africa and for small states. Areas with
greatest distance to the frontier are getting credit, resolving insolvency, paying taxes,
protecting minority investors and enforcing contracts.

Appendix I. Letter of Intent
São Tomé, May 18, 2016
Ms. Christine Lagarde
Managing Director
International Monetary Fund
700 19th Street N.W.
Washington, D.C. 20431
USA
Dear Ms. Lagarde:
1.
The Democratic Republic of São Tomé and Príncipe has made progress in
implementing its economic reform program, supported by an IMF arrangement under the
Extended Credit Facility (ECF) since July 2015. Despite the country’s fragility and an uncertain
environment, the government’s efforts to strengthen macroeconomic stability, foster
sustainable and inclusive growth, and reduce poverty in the context of the second National
Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP-II) have begun to bear fruit. In general,
macroeconomic stability improved, economic growth stabilized, and inflation declined
further. However, the economy continues to face significant challenges in terms of rising
debt and weak competitiveness, undermining the job creation and poverty reduction efforts.
We have stepped-up our engagement with creditors and donors toward reaching a
cooperative and meaningful solution for the country’s large infrastructural needs.
Our ambitious structural reform agenda―primarily aimed at addressing bottlenecks to
higher, sustained, and inclusive growth and strengthening the financial sector―is also being
implemented with technical and financial assistance from our international partners.
2.
The government believes that measures and policies described in the July 2015
Memorandum of Economic and Financial Policies (MEFP attachment I) remain appropriate for
attaining the objectives of our program. The attached supplement to the MEFP discusses
performance under the program thus far and updates policies toward meeting these
objectives. Our key focus going forward will be to: align fiscal policy to anchor medium-term
debt reduction; address the liquidity overhang to enhance monetary management; improve
competitiveness; and safeguard financial sector stability to support growth.
3.
Recently, the government concluded discussions on the first review under the
ECF-supported program with an IMF staff mission, with focus on program implementation
through end-December 2015, as well as on measures to be implemented during 2016.
Performance under the ECF-supported program has been satisfactory. Although budget
execution was challenged due to tax revenue underperformance, all but one of the endDecember 2015 performance criteria (PCs) were met. The PC on domestic primary deficit was
missed by about 0.3 percent of GDP. The indicative targets on tax revenue (a floor), pro-poor
spending (floor), and dobra money (ceiling) were also missed. On the other hand, all of the
structural benchmarks were implemented. The government has since introduced corrective

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

47

DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF SÃO TOMÉ AND PRÍNCIPE

measures to address the revenue shortfall and believes these are well-entrenched to prevent
future occurrence.
4.
The attached MEFP describes government policies for 2016 that would support
achieving program objectives under the ECF arrangement. We remain fully committed to
achieve the objectives of the program and will take any additional measures necessary to
that end. We will consult with the IMF on the adoption of such measures prior to any revision
of the policies indicated in the MEFP.
5.
In light of the progress in implementing the program, we request the IMF Executive
Board to approve the waiver for non-observance of domestic primary deficit performance
criteria with test date at end-December 2015, modification of performance criteria on
domestic primary deficit and net international reserves, and request for the completion of the
first review as well as the second disbursement of SDR 634,285 under this arrangement.
Without prejudice to the original intent, we request that the two continuous performance
criteria on non-concessional external borrowing be combined into one that establishes a
ceiling on the contracting or guaranteeing of new external debt of any maturity (including
overdraft positions but excluding normal import credits) by the government and/or the
BCSTP.
6.
The government will continue to provide Fund staff with all relevant information
mentioned in the Technical Memorandum of Understanding (TMU), concerning further
progress made under the program. During the program period, the government will not
introduce or strengthen any exchange controls, multiple exchange rate practices, or import
restrictions for balance of payments purposes, nor will it conclude any bilateral payment
agreements in violation of Article VIII of the Fund’s Articles of Agreement.
7.
The government agrees to make public this Letter of Intent, along with the attached
MEFP and TMU, the debt sustainability analysis (DSA) performed by the IMF and World Bank
staff, as well as the entire IMF staff report on the first review and Article IV consultation. We
hereby authorize their publication and posting on the IMF website, once the IMF Executive
Board approves the completion of the Article IV consultation and the first review under the
three-year arrangement under the ECF.
Sincerely yours,
/s/
Mr. Américo d’Oliveira Ramos,
Minister of Finance and Public Administration

Attachment I. Memorandum of Economic and Financial
Policies for 2016–18
This Memorandum of Economic and Financial Policies (MEFP) updates the one outlined in the
ECF-supported program approved by the IMF Executive Board on July 13, 2015. It describes
recent macroeconomic developments, implementation of the ECF-supported program, the
economic outlook and risks, and macroeconomic policies.

RECENT ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS
1.
São Tomé and Príncipe continued to make progress towards macroeconomic
stability but delayed approval of the 2015 budget slowed down the pace of
consolidation. GDP growth for 2015, estimated at 4 percent, fell short of the projected
5 percent due to delayed implementation of public investment projects and poor rains that
affected cocoa production. Inflation, on the other hand, was at 4 percent at the end of 2015
(the lowest in the past two decades), reflecting the slowdown in economic activity.
2.
The government’s fiscal operations yielded mixed results. Fiscal consolidation
efforts have been hampered by tax revenue underperformance. Tax revenue is estimated to
have fallen short of the end of year target by about 0.8 percent of GDP, in part due to a lower
collection effort of tax arrears and delayed inclusion of the 15,000 new taxpayers registered
during the operation tax inclusion project. In addition, ENCO (the oil importing company)
continued to accumulate new tax arrears in 2015. While the government made modest
offsetting cuts in expenditure, these were insufficient, resulting in a domestic primary deficit
of about 3.0 percent of GDP, higher than the program target of 2.7 percent of GDP.
3.
Growth in monetary aggregates also decelerated in line with the slowdown in
economic activity. Broad money (M3) grew by 13.1 percent at the end of 2015, down from
16.8 percent at the end of the previous year. Similarly, the rate of growth in net foreign assets
more than halved to 13.3 percent from 35.3 percent. Net domestic assets increased by
11.7 percent after declining by 45.2 percent in 2014; the turnaround mirrored a small
rebound in credit to the economy, largely to households.
4.
The financial sector continues to face challenges. The banking system’s capital
adequacy ratio (measured as capital to assets ratio) declined from 20.3 percent in December
2014 to 15.5 percent at the end of 2015, while the capital to risk-weighted assets ratio
increased to 24.1 percent from 22.6 percent. Non-performing loans (NPLs) also increased to
29.8 percent, following the reclassification of overdue overdrafts in Banco Equador’s books as
bad loans and a downgrade in a sizeable share of the largest bank’s loan classification to
loss.
5.
There was however, an improvement in the balance of payments helped by
lower commodity prices. The external current account deficit fell to 16.7 percent of GDP,
reflecting weak economic activity and a contraction in oil and other commodity imports that
more than offset the decline in exports due to lower cocoa production. The central bank’s
INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

gross international reserves, estimated at US$61 million (4.4 months of imports), remain at
comfortable levels.

PERFORMANCE UNDER THE ECF-SUPPORTED PROGRAM
6.
The program performance through end-December 2015 was satisfactory.
All continuous and quantitative performance criteria (PC) were met with the exception of the
PC on domestic primary deficit. The PC on domestic primary deficit was missed by about
0.3 percent of GDP on account of lower-than-expected tax revenue following under-recovery
of tax arrears and delays in including new taxpayers in the tax base. Nonetheless, the
government has introduced corrective measures to aggressively collect tax arrears and to
include the new taxpayers in the tax base this year. New legislative instruments to this effect
will be submitted to Parliament by end-September 2016. In addition, indicative targets on tax
revenue (a floor), pro-poor expenditure (floor) and on dobra money (ceiling) were also
missed.
7.
Progress continues towards implementation of the structural reform agenda.
The government began to execute the domestic arrears clearance plan, which was developed
as prior action for approval of the ECF arrangement. Overall, there was a net reduction in
domestic arrears to utility companies by 1.2 percent of GDP, 0.4 percent of GDP higher than
budgeted, eliminating arrears to the utility company (EMAE). EMAE in turn reduced its arrears
to ENCO by 2.6 percent of GDP. However EMAE arrears to ENCO in 2015 increased on net
basis (by 2.2 percent of GDP), albeit, by less than initially projected. Clearance of treasury
arrears to ENCO will start this year. This has been included in the 2016 budget. The National
Assembly passed the bank resolution law (end-September 2015 structural benchmark).
This provides the necessary legal framework for the swift and orderly resolution of Banco
Equador. To make available more representative statistics for policy evaluation and design,
the statistical agency (INE) began to compile the new re-weighted and expanded monthly
CPI series, and to publish revised national accounts series through 2013 (both structural
benchmarks for end-December 2015).

ECONOMIC OUTLOOK AND RISKS
8.
The macroeconomic outlook is favorable in the near term but challenges
remain. GDP is projected to grow by 5 percent in 2016, based on higher and timely
execution of the public sector investment program, recovery in cocoa production, and
improved external conditions (and a consequent improvement in tourism and FDI).
Inflation is expected to remain stable at around 4 percent given current forecasts for
international food and fuel prices, but still higher than the euro area inflation.
The government will have to continue to rely on concessional financing and grants; with
difficulty in identifying new budget financing prospects, fiscal tightening will have to
continue to ensure that gains from macroeconomic stability are protected.
9.
Downside risks weigh on these prospects. Facing high risk of debt distress, the
economy remains vulnerable to external shocks, which complicate the conduct of
macroeconomic policies and discourage investment with resulting adverse consequences for
50

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF SÃO TOMÉ AND PRÍNCIPE

growth and poverty reduction. The forthcoming presidential election, slated for July 2016,
with the risk of extra budgetary spending during the electoral period, and continued
weakness in the banking sector pose significant short-term risks to the outlook. However, the
government is fully committed to mitigating these near-term risks by maintaining the
momentum of fiscal discipline in the run up to the presidential election, and enhancing
supervision and oversight of banks. Additional downside risks could arise from weak demand
in key advanced and emerging economies, which could dampen FDI and tourism inflows and
reduce exports to those economies.

MACROECONOMIC POLICIES
A. Staying the Course on Debt Reduction while Improving the Quality
of Spending
The Debt Reduction Program and 2016 Fiscal Framework
10.
As debt vulnerabilities remain high, the government reaffirms its commitment
to fiscal prudence. The 2016 fiscal program, presented in the government’s budget, targets
a domestic primary deficit of 2 percent of GDP, which is consistent with the program and in
line with the goal of ensuring that the path of debt returns to a downward trajectory toward
moderate risk of debt distress over the medium term. The fiscal program for 2016 is fully
funded despite a sharp increase in capital spending which would mostly be financed by
privatization proceeds from government’s shares in the largest bank and the telecom
company (5 percent of GDP), HIPC grants and disbursements of already contracted project
loans (4.3 percent of GDP). There are also new concessional loans from Kuwait and Turkey
(4.3 percent of GDP) to be used primarily for investments in rural roads and bridges,
construction and rehabilitation of schools, improvement of the national health system,
including maintenance and equipment of a hospital and health centers. This notwithstanding,
the government is committed to frontload fiscal adjustment in 2016 to achieve the domestic
primary deficit target that is consistent with the available non-debt creating financing.

The Medium-Term Fiscal Framework
11.
The government sees the need, over the medium-term, to ensure that fiscal
policy walks a fine line between maintaining fiscal consolidation and creating space for
growth-enhancing infrastructure spending. To achieve the above, the government is
committed to bring the domestic primary deficit further down to around 1–1½ percent of
GDP by 2018 to ensure that debt remains on a downward trajectory, and at the same time
create enough space for domestically-financed infrastructure spending to complement donor
support. This would imply a significant step-up in domestic revenue mobilization through a
combination of tax policies (introduction of VAT), customs and tax administration measures,
including greater and more disciplined inspections and audits (to start immediately),
integration of Príncipe’s tax delegation, introduction and use of more modern computer
information systems with updated taxpayer database (to be implemented by end-June 2017).

Structural Reforms to Strengthen Public Finances
12.
Fiscal policy would concentrate on efforts to enhance domestic revenue
mobilization and improve the quality of spending. On the revenue side, we would take
the necessary steps to increase tax revenue collection to the levels of São Tomé and
Príncipe’s peer groups by 2018. Specific actions in 2016 will include:


Start the payment of arrears to ENCO, latest by the end-June 2016, as a good-faith
measure to address ENCO’s nonpayment of import duties.



Introduce more comprehensive and disciplined inspections and audits to curb fraud
and tax evasion.



Extend tax collection coverage to new taxpayers and aggressively collect tax arrears.
To this effect, the government will implement a number of legislative changes,
including lowering the minimum taxable income and raising the minimum
presumptive levy charged to individuals and firms and transferring the execution
powers for collection of tax arrears from the fiscal court judge to the tax
administration (end-September 2016 structural benchmark).



Introduce structures and measures to support the introduction of VAT to widen the
tax base and enhance domestic revenue collection. In particular, the government will
submit to the National Assembly a new VAT law by (end-December 2016 structural
benchmark).

13.
The government is committed to the introduction of the automatic fuel price
adjustment mechanism (end-June 2016 structural benchmark). The technical team for
petroleum price adjustment is currently reviewing the recommendations from the IMF TA in
November 2015, to design a roadmap for implementation of the automatic fuel price
adjustment. The technical team has been mandated to work on the following by end
March 2016:


Specify the pricing formula, including choosing a proper international reference price,
raise the surcharge rate on fuel products to lock in an eventual positive price
differential, deciding on the frequency of the price adjustment and the width of the
price band. This will require the National Assembly authorizing the Minister to be
able to make changes in surcharges.



Decide on the short-run revenue target for gasoline and diesel.



Decide on whether to maintain the pretax subsidy on kerosene, and if maintained, it
has to be presented in the budget.



An agency/secretariat has to be set up to be responsible for the implementation of
the price adjustment mechanism. This agency, among other things will be responsible
for monitoring the responsibilities of parties involved in the pricing mechanism and
the processes for its regular and transparent application. A request will be sent to the
IMF/FAD to help decide on the terms of reference for the creation of this agency.

52

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF SÃO TOMÉ AND PRÍNCIPE



Select a third party to carry out a detailed study on fuel product and margin
components.



Select targeted mitigating measures that will be introduced in tandem with the new
pricing mechanism.



Design and launch a public information campaign.

14.
On the spending side, strengthening public financial management and
transparency will be the focal point for ensuring efficiency in public expenditure.
Specific measures will include:


Roll out the electronic information management system (SAFEe) from the current
pilot stage to cover all ministries, autonomous services, other sovereignty institutions,
regional and local government to strengthen public financial oversight.



Enhanced SAFEe’s functionality to facilitate the preparation of a more comprehensive
and transparent general government accounts by including features such as
reconciliation of treasury bank accounts, tracking of revenue, management of fixed
assets and registry of government contracts that give rise to new liabilities.



Reactivate and ensure a fully operational macro-fiscal unit and implement needed
changes in the SAFEe Law (Lei 3/2007) and budget classification decree (decreto
4/2007) by end of March 2017 to support the move towards the introduction of a
medium-term fiscal and expenditure frameworks.

15.
The government has identified key growth-enhancing infrastructure spending
needed to increase real GDP growth to the minimum required target of 6 percent to
significantly impact poverty. In particular the government is considering the extension of
the airport runway in São Tomé to attract larger aircrafts to boost tourism, and also
investment in alternative sources of energy (beyond thermal) to bring down the energy cost
compared to its peers. In 2015, the government signed MOUs (about US$800 million) with
China Harbor Engineering Company to design a PPP with financing from the private sector to
build a deepwater port in São Tomé. The government reiterates its commitment that there
will be no fiscal cost and contingent liabilities to be borne by the government in this project.
The government will not go ahead with this project if it is not fully financed by the private
sector. The government is fully aware and is committed to relying on concessional financing
and grants to support key infrastructure projects in order to ensure that debt returns to a
downward trajectory over the medium term.
16.
To this end, the government is committed to enhancing investment capacity to
support growth-enhancing infrastructure spending. The government will introduce a
centralized framework for appraising and prioritizing capital expenditure projects in addition
to the introduction of a public investment management assessment (PIMA) framework
(end-March 2017 structural benchmark).
17.
The government is committed to implementing the debt framework law
(Lei 1/2013 de 17 de Janeiro de 2013) and to strengthening debt management
INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

53

DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF SÃO TOMÉ AND PRÍNCIPE

capacity. In that context, the government will: (i) prepare a national debt strategy, as
required by the debt framework law, that will fix a ceiling on the overall debt of the nonfinancial public sector as well as annual debt policies that fix annual ceilings for each public
entity; (ii) update the medium-term debt management strategy; (iii) seek technical assistance
to prepare a manual of procedures for debt management and to carry out a new debt
management performance assessment (DeMPA) by the end of 2016; and (iv) prepare a
comprehensive public private partnership (PPP) law and framework by end-September 2016
to guide the growing expressions of interests for PPPs following the London donors’
conference in October 2015. In addition, the debt office will recover and update the existing
debt database in the debt management system (CS-DRMS 2000+) and get the Crown Agent
to validate it and provide training to new staff.
18.
The government will continue to give priority to concessional financing.
Consistent with the IMF’s new policy on debt limits, the government has prepared a
borrowing plan (Text Table 1). Under this plan, the government is committed to a prudent
borrowing target, for 2016–18, of about US$45.4 million in nominal terms for priority
projects.11 This target implies an average annual PV of new external debt of 2.6 percent of
GDP. All loans are expected to be on concessional terms, with the bulk to finance
infrastructure projects and social spending. The government reserves the right to revise this
plan during the next ECF review.

B. Addressing the Liquidity Overhang to Enhance Monetary
Management
19.
Slowdown in credit growth since 2013 as a result of rising NPLs and lack of
bankable projects has resulted in a build-up of excess liquidity in the banking system
which is complicating liquidity management. At the moment, it is estimated that the
excess liquidity in the banking system topped 5 percent of GDP at the end of 2015.
The central bank of São Tomé and Príncipe (BCSTP) has introduced some tools to help with
liquidity management. In 2015, the BCSTP introduced an interbank market but unfortunately,
this has not taken off due to perceived stigma banks associate to participating in the
interbank market. However, we expect it is only temporary given the recent developments in
the domestic financial market. The BCSTP is working with the banks to address this challenge.
In addition, the government introduced treasury bills which have been well-received by
banks and participation has increased with the second issue of the 9-month treasury bills
oversubscribed. The BCSTP is working towards developing a treasury bonds market, creating
the conditions for longer-term liquidity management, as well as developing the secondary
market.
20.
Work on developing BCSTP’s monetary liquidity management framework
continues. The existing liquidity forecasting tool allows for improved information gathering
and more accurate analysis of the autonomous factors that drive liquidity. In 2015 the central
bank implemented a new payment methodology for the commercial banks; such that
payment orders issued by the Treasury to commercial banks in the period t are now paid in
the period t+1 thus enabling the BCSTP to include them in its liquidity forecasting,
considerably reducing forecasting errors.

C. Improving Competitiveness and Setting the Stage for Sustainable
and Inclusive Growth
21.
The government plans to promote private sector-led growth to set the stage for
higher sustainable growth and distribute its benefits more widely. The broad outlines of
the government’s 2030 Transformation Agenda identify the priorities for medium to longterm growth, social cohesion and external credibility, including diversifying the economy,
broadening the production base, and modernizing the economic and social infrastructure.
The government is seeking to create conditions conducive to support the traditional sectors,
such as agriculture, fisheries, and tourism to boost job creation and reduce poverty.
22.
The untapped tourism potential of São Tomé and Príncipe offers much promise.
Medium-term structural reforms will focus on high-yielding tourism activities, broader
diversification of source markets, and more open, competitive air transport connections.
Specific policy initiatives in 2016 will include:


Introducing targeted reforms to address the poor performing indicators in the World
Bank’s Doing Business survey.



Diversifying tourism source markets and supporting open, competitive air transport
policy, including allowing direct links to the sub region, Europe, and Brazil.
INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

55

DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF SÃO TOMÉ AND PRÍNCIPE



Developing a national export diversification strategy (end-December 2016 structural
benchmark).

D. Macro-Financial Linkages and Financial Sector Stability
23.
São Tomé and Príncipe’s highly-concentrated banking system is not only
challenged with excess liquidity but also low profitability. The largest bank accounts for
about half of the system’s deposits and loans, and the remaining six small banks account for
the other half. NPLs have almost since 2013 and reached 30 percent of total credit in 2015.
Indicators of profitability suggest pervasive weakness, with only the largest bank profitable
while other banks face negative (some highly) returns on assets. Return on equity has also
been deteriorating and was reported as -27 percent in 2015. Corrective measures by BCSTP
are beginning to yield results. As a result of supervision actions, three out of seven banks
increased their capital in the last quarter of 2015, to meet the minimum requirement. BCSTP
is at the early stage of building adequate crisis management and bank resolution frameworks
to deal with risks in the financial system. The new banking resolution law provides the legal
framework for a swift and orderly resolution of banks, including Banco Equador. A transition
bank is being created with quality assets and liabilities of Banco Equador, and steps are being
taken to identify potential buyers and conclude the process within 1 year from the
establishment of the transition bank. If a potential buyer is not identified within one year of
the establishment of the transition bank, the BCSTP will proceed with the final liquidation of
Banco Equador.
24.
The BCSTP is putting together a comprehensive strategy to address the large
stock of NPLs (end-June 2016 structural benchmark). This would involve stocktaking,
provisioning and recapitalizing specific banks if needed. In addition, the BCSTP will conduct
detailed asset quality reviews for all banks to reduce the uncertainty surrounding bank assets,
and where necessary demand recapitalization of affected banks, bearing in mind an
additional objective of consolidation in the banking system.
25.
To further safeguard financial stability, the BSCTP will strengthen on-site and
off-site banking supervision by increasing the number of direct inspections. This will
ensure stricter direct follow-up. A cycle of bank inspections, which began in 2015, was
completed, and another cycle commenced in 2016.
26.
The BCSTP welcomes São Tomé and Príncipe’s selection as a pilot country for
mainstreaming macro-financial linkages as part of the Article IV consultation.
BCSTP shares the recommendations of the exercise and is looking forward to implementing
the key recommendations. In particular, BCSTP will take the necessary steps to:


Implement necessary measures to tackle the large stock and growing NPLs which are
beginning to have negative spillback on growth.



Strengthen financial sector stability by: requiring that banks with below minimum
capital ratios increase their capital base, and conducting regular asset quality reviews
to identify problem banks that will require swift corrective measures.

56

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF SÃO TOMÉ AND PRÍNCIPE



Further develop the treasury bills market, while ensuring its consistency with the fiscal
sector.

27.
While measures of financial inclusion in São Tomé and Príncipe compare well
with its regional peers, the impact on poverty reduction and private sector
development is unclear. Low financial, documentation and barriers to entry contribute to
relatively high access levels. Bank branches are relatively evenly dispersed and minimum
requirements are comparatively low, and the number of adults with savings accounts is larger
than the regional average. However, important challenges remain in terms of achieving
universal inclusion. Specific actions in 2016 include:


Improving the coverage and effectiveness of the credit reference bureaus.



Streamlining procedures to ensure collateral enforcement, including reforms to the
judiciary.



Capacity building of SMEs in basic accounting, financial management, and
preparation of bankable projects.

OTHER PROGRAM ISSUES
28.
Initiatives to strengthen safeguards and improve transparency have been
introduced since 2015. A safeguards assessment mission was conducted by the IMF’s
Finance Department in September 2015, which recommended independent oversight of the
audit mechanisms, internal controls, and financial reporting. Given capacity constraints, it was
also recognized that external audits done by a reputable audit firm continued to serve as a
critical safeguard. In order to further strengthen internal controls, several measures were
adopted including the restructuring of the internal audit committee and the appointment of
a new Director with recognized competences. Furthermore BCSTP is in the process of
acquiring new equipments that automatically sort and destroy mutilated bills and thus
reduce human intervention in the process. With respect to financial reporting, the BCSTP has
sought TA from Brazil and the IMF to migrate statements of accounts to the International
Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS), and the work on the revising the organic central bank
law is ongoing. In 2016, the BCSTP plans to:


Update the Internal Audit Charter and establish a database to monitor and prioritize
audit recommendations by end-June 2016.



Establish an Audit Board policy (end-December 2016 structural benchmark), similar to
an Audit Committee Charter, that specifies roles and responsibilities similar to that of
a conventional Audit Committee, which would include oversight of the internal and
external audit mechanism.



Conduct risk-based audits of high-risk areas, including foreign reserves, currency and
vault operations, and banking operations by end-December 2016.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

57

(structural benchmark) to align its legal framework with leading practices for central
banks.

Attachment II. Technical Memorandum of Understanding
June 2016
1.
This Technical Memorandum of Understanding (TMU) contains definitions and
adjuster mechanisms that clarify the measurement of quantitative performance criteria and
indicative targets in Table 3, which are attached to the Memorandum of Economic and
Financial Policies for 2016 and 2017. Unless otherwise specified, all quantitative performance
criteria and indicative targets will be evaluated in terms of cumulative flows from the
beginning of each calendar year.
2.
The program exchange rate for the purposes of this TMU1 will be 20,299 dobra per
U.S. dollar, 24,500 dobra per euro, and 29,236 dobra per SDR for both 2016 and 2017.

PROVISION OF DATA TO THE FUND
3.
Data with respect to all variables subject to performance criteria and indicative
targets will be provided to Fund staff on the frequency described below (paragraph 27) with
a lag of no more than four weeks for data on net international reserves of the Central Bank of
São Tomé and Príncipe (BCSTP) and six weeks for other data. The authorities will transmit
promptly to Fund staff any data revisions. For variables that are relevant for assessing
performance against program objectives but are not specifically defined in this
memorandum, the authorities will consult with Fund staff as needed on the appropriate way
of measuring and reporting. Performance criteria included in the program are defined below
and refer to the floor on domestic primary balance; the ceiling on changes in net bank
financing of the central government; the floor on net international reserves of the central
bank; the ceiling on central government’s outstanding external payments arrears; the ceiling
on the contracting or guaranteeing of new non-concessional external debt with original
maturity of more than one year by the central government or the BCSTP; and the ceiling on
the outstanding stock of external debt with original maturity of up to and including one year
owed or guaranteed by the central government or the BCSTP.

DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF SÃO TOMÉ AND PRÍNCIPE

6.
Debt is defined as in paragraph 8 of the Guidelines on Public Debt Conditionality in
Fund Arrangements, adopted by Decision No. 15688 of the Executive Board (Dec. 5, 2014).
Debt will be understood to mean a current, i.e., not contingent, liability, created under a
contractual agreement through the provision of value in the form of assets (including
currency) or services, and which requires the obligor to make one or more payments in the
form of assets (including currency) or services at some future point(s) in time; these
payments will discharge the principal and/or interest liabilities incurred under the contract.
7.
Government domestic revenue (excluding oil revenue) comprises all tax and nontax revenue of the government (in domestic and foreign currencies), excluding: (1) foreign
grants, (2) the receipts from the local sale of in-kind grants (e.g., crude oil received from
Nigeria, food aid, etc.), and (3) any gross inflows to the government on account of oil
signature bonus receipts and accrued interest on the National Oil Account (NOA).
Revenue will be measured on a cash basis as reported in the table of government financial
operations prepared by the Directorate of Budget and the Directorate of Treasury in the
Ministry of Finance and Public Administration.
8.
Domestic primary expenditure comprises all government spending assessed on a
commitment basis (base compromisso), excluding (1) capital expenditure financed with
external concessional loans and grants and (2) scheduled interest payments. Reporting of
government domestic expenditure will be based on the state budget execution prepared
every month by the Directorate of Budget and the Directorate of Treasury in the Ministry of
Finance and Public Administration.

PERFORMANCE CRITERIA
9.
Performance criterion on the floor on domestic primary balance.
This performance criterion refers to the difference between government domestic revenue
(excluding oil revenue) and domestic primary expenditure. For reference, this balance for
end-December 2015 was -207 billion dobra, broken down as follows:
Government domestic revenue:
Less:
Government primary expenditure:
(As defined in paragraph 8)
Equals: Domestic primary balance:

1,108 billion
1,315 billion
-207 billion

10.
Performance criterion on the ceiling on changes in net bank financing of the
central government (NCG). This performance criterion measures the increase (decrease) in
the stock of all outstanding claims on the central government held by the BCSTP and by
other depository corporations (ODCs), less all deposits held by the central government with
the BCSTP and with ODCs, as they are reported monthly by the BCSTP to the IMF staff.
The balance of the National Oil Account (NOA) is not included in NCG. All foreign exchangedenominated accounts will be converted to dobra at the program exchange rate.
For reference, at end-December 2015, outstanding net bank financing of the central
government (excluding NOA) was -43.2 billion dobra, broken down as follows:

11.
Performance criterion on the floor on net international reserves (NIR) of the
BCSTP. The NIR of the BCSTP are defined for program-monitoring purposes as short-term
(i.e., original maturities of one year or less), tradable foreign assets of the BCSTP minus shortterm external liabilities, including liabilities to the IMF. All short-term foreign assets that are
not fully convertible external assets nor readily available to and controlled by the BCSTP
(i.e., they are pledged or otherwise encumbered external assets, including but not limited to
the HIPC umbrella SDR account and assets used as collateral or guarantees for third-party
liabilities) will be excluded from the definition of NIR. Securities whose market value on the
last day of the year differs by over 20 percent from their original nominal issue price will be
assessed at their market value as reported by the BCSTP’s Markets Department. The balance
of (1) NOA at the BCSTP, (2) banks’ deposits related to capital or licensing requirements, and
(3) banks’ reserves denominated in foreign currency are excluded from the program
definition of NIR. All values are to be converted to U.S. dollars at the actual mid-point market
exchange rates prevailing at the test date. For reference, at end-December 2015 NIR was
1,267.4 billion dobra, calculated as follows:
Gross international reserves:

12.
Performance criterion on the ceiling on the contracting or guaranteeing of new
nonconcessional external debt by the central government or the BCSTP. This is a
continuous performance criterion that refers to the contracting or guaranteeing of new
external debt of any maturity (including overdraft positions but excluding normal import and
suppliers credits) by the government and/or the BCSTP. Debt is considered nonconcessional
if it includes a grant element less than 35 percent. The grant element is the difference
between the nominal value of the loan and its net present value, expressed as a percentage
of the nominal value. The net present value of the debt at the date on which it is contracted
is calculated by discounting the debt service payments at the time of the contracting of the
debt. The discount rate used for this purpose is 5 percent. With respect to the precautionary
line of credit from Portugal to support the pegging of the dobra to the euro, unpaid balances
outstanding during the first three quarters of a given calendar year will be excluded from this
ceiling. However, outstanding balances at the end of a given calendar year will be included in
the assessment of compliance with this performance criterion. This performance criterion
does not apply to IMF facilities. Debt being rescheduled or restructured is excluded from this
ceiling. Medium- and long-term debt will be reported by the Debt Management Department
of the Ministry of Finance and Public Administration (as appropriate) by the BCSTP, measured
in U.S. dollars at the prevailing exchange rates. The government should consult with IMF staff
before contracting or guaranteeing new medium- or long-term debt obligations.
13.
Performance criterion on the ceiling on central government’s outstanding
external payment arrears. This is a continuous performance criterion. Central government
external payment arrears consist of external debt service obligations (principal and interest)
that have not been paid at the time they are due, as specified in the contractual agreement,
subject to any applicable grace period. This performance criterion does not apply to arrears
resulting from the nonpayment of debt service for which a clearance framework has been
agreed or for which the government is actively seeking a rescheduling agreement.

INDICATIVE TARGETS
14.
Ceiling on change of central government’s new domestic arrears is set on the
difference between expenditure on a commitment basis and cash payments (amounts past
due after 40 days and unpaid).
15.
Ceiling on dobra base money is set on the sum of currency issued—which consists
of currency outside depository corporations and cash in vaults—and banks reserves
denominated in dobra. Bank reserves refer to reserves of commercial banks (in dobra) held
with the central bank and include reserves in excess of the reserve requirements.
For reference, at end-December 2015 dobra base money was 1,295.7 billion dobra, calculated
as follows:

16.
Within domestic primary expenditure, the floor on pro-poor expenditure refers to
the floor on government outlays recorded in the budget that have a direct effect on reducing
poverty, as agreed with the IMF and World Bank staffs. These expenditures, which include
both current and capital outlays, are defined as follows:
a. Pro-poor current spending: These cover the following functional classifications and
expenditure categories (by budget code) as described in the matrix below:

Expenditures on fuels and lubricants (combustíveis e lubrificantes ) that are affected for administrative purposes are excluded. Likewise, food (alimentação ) and clothing and shoes (roupas e calçados ) supplied to administrative staff are excluded.

b. Pro-poor treasury-funded capital spending: This covers projects that are deemed
to have a direct impact on alleviating poverty in the following sectors: education,
health, social safety nets, agriculture and fisheries, rural development, youth and
sports, provision of potable water, and electrification.
17.

MEMORANDUM ITEMS
18.
New concessional external debt contracted or guaranteed with original
maturity of more than one year by the central government or the BCSTP measures such
debt with a grant element of at least 35 percent.
19.
Net external debt service payments by the central government are defined as
debt service due less the accumulation of any new external payment arrears, as defined
under the performance criterion on the ceiling on central government’s outstanding external
payment arrears.
20.
Official external program support is defined as grants and loans, including in-kind
aid when the products are sold by the government and the receipts are earmarked for a
budgeted spending item, and other exceptional financing provided by foreign official entities
and incorporated into the budget.
21.
Treasury-funded capital expenditure is classified as part of domestic primary
expenditure and covers public investment projects that are not directly financed by project
grants and concessional loans or that have to be partially co-financed with government
resources. It includes spending on new construction, rehabilitation, and maintenance.
Expenditure on wages and salaries and the purchase of goods and services related to the
projects will not be classified as capital expenditure.

USE OF ADJUSTERS
22.
The performance criterion on the domestic primary balance will have one
adjuster. The limit on the domestic primary balance will be adjusted upward if the
government finds budget support and privatization receipts in 2016 and 2017 in addition to
that described in the MEFP; this adjuster will be capped at 70.3 billion dobra (about 1 percent
of 2015 GDP) for 2016 and 2017.2
23.
The performance criteria on net bank financing of the central government and
net international reserves of the central bank will be adjusted in line with deviations from
amounts projected in the program for budget transfers from the NOA, official external
program support, net external debt service payments, and domestic arrears will trigger
adjustments on the above mentioned performance criteria. These deviations will be
calculated cumulatively from end-December 2015 or end-December 2016, as appropriate
(MEFP attachment I, Table 3). The following is an explanation of these adjustments:


Adjusters on ceilings on changes in net bank financing of the central government

transfers from the NOA, official external program support, net external debt service
payments, and domestic arrears will be converted to dobra at the program exchange
rate and aggregated from end-December 2015 or end-December 2016, as
appropriate, to the test date. The ceilings will be adjusted downward (upward) by
cumulative deviations downward (upward) of actual from projected net external debt
service payments, and by deviations upward (downward) in budget transfers from the
NOA, official external program support, and domestic arrears. The combined
application of all adjusters at any test date is capped at the equivalent to US$3million
at the program exchange rate.
Adjusters for the floor on net international reserves (NIR) of the BCSTP: Quarterly
differences between actual and projected receipts of budget transfers from the NOA,
official external program support, net external debt service payments, and domestic
arrears in dobra, will be converted to U.S. dollars at the program exchange rate and
aggregated from end-December 2015 or end-December 2016, as appropriate, to the
test date. The floor will be adjusted upward (downward) by the cumulative deviation
downward (upward) of actual from projected net external debt service payments of
the central government, and by deviations upward (downward) for budget transfers
from the NOA, official external program support, and domestic arrears.
The combined application of all adjusters at any test date is capped in such a way
that the adjusted floor does not fall short of US$50 million in 2016 and US$52 million
in 2017.

Safeguards Assessments:
The recent update of safeguards assessment found that severe capacity constraints have
contributed to a weak safeguards framework at the BCSTP. In particular, safeguards relating to
independent oversight on audit, financial reporting, and control mechanisms need strengthening.
In addition, the BCSTP’s legal framework will need to be revised to align it with leading practices for
central banks. While external audits conducted by a reputable audit firm continue to serve as a
critical safeguard, ongoing institutional development will be needed to strengthen capacity and
bolster the safeguards framework. Further, the engagement of the Audit Board with revised roles
and responsibilities will be needed for better oversight.

Exchange Arrangements:
The de jure and de facto exchange rate arrangement is a conventional peg against the euro.
Since January 2010 São Tomé and Príncipe has pegged the dobra to the euro at a rate of dobra
24,500 per euro. The organic law of the BCSTP authorizes it to make decisions regarding exchange
rate policy. The commission on foreign exchange sales cannot be higher than 2 percent for the euro
and 4 percent for other currencies. Purchases of euro must be done at the rate published by the
BCSTP and no commissions are allowed. The official euro–U.S. dollar cross rate is based on the
European Central Bank (ECB) reference rate of the previous day. The BCSTP finances current
international transactions at the official exchange rate only after verification of the documentation
establishing the bona fide nature of the bank’s request. Access to foreign exchange is limited to
institutions having a net position in the transaction currency of less than 12 percent of qualified
capital, a net position in total foreign currency less than 25 percent of qualified capital, and which
are in compliance with the central bank’s regulations on bank liquidity and capital adequacy.
Financial institutions are allowed access to the central bank’s facilities regardless of the above
conditions if the foreign exchange is to be used for importation of goods and services in periods of
crisis or for the importation of fuel. Commercial banks that meet these requirements can buy foreign
exchange directly from the central bank, which can charge up to 1.5 percent commission on sales of
euro and up to a 0.5 percent commission on purchases of euro. The buying rate is mainly indicative
because the BCSTP rarely makes purchases. The current exchange rate system has effectively
eliminated the multiple currency practice related to the existence of numerous exchange rate
markets with differing exchange rates for spot transactions that existed in previous years.
São Tomé and Príncipe continue to avail itself of the transitional arrangements under Article XIV, but
it does not maintain restrictions under Article XIV. However, it maintains one measure subject to
Fund approval under Article VIII: an exchange restriction arising from Article 3(i) and
Article 10.1(b) of the Investment Code (Law No. 7/2008) regarding limitations on the transferability
of net income from investment. The restriction results from the requirement that taxes and other
obligations to the government have to be paid/full-filled as a condition for transfer, to the extent
the requirement includes the payment of taxes and the fulfillment of obligations unrelated to the
net income to be transferred.

RELATIONS WITH THE WORLD BANK GROUP
Joint Managerial Action Plan (JMAP) for São Tomé and Príncipe
(As of April, 2016)
1.
The IMF and World Bank São Tomé and Príncipe teams held regular meetings to discuss
their respective work programs and macro critical structural reforms for São Tomé and Príncipe.
The two institutions’ teams met in the context of the preparations for the current ECF-supported
program that discusses policies and financing during the prospective program period 2015–18, and
for the prospective financial sector development plan (a World Bank initiative).
2.
The World Bank’s work program is guided by a Country Assistance Strategy for the fiscal
years 2014 to 2018 approved in 2014 that focuses on supporting growth and job creation through
two broad themes: macroeconomic stability and national competitiveness, and reducing
vulnerability and strengthening human capacity. Gender, partnership, and capacity building are
elements that cut across all the proposed engagements. A Debt Management and Performance
Assessment (DeMPA) report was completed in October 2011, and an accompanying reform plan to
improve debt management was completed in March 2012. The Bank has suggested the government
to formally ask for a follow-up DeMPA mission.
3.
The IMF’s work program includes the Executive Board’s consideration of the second review
under the ECF-supported program, together with the 2013 Article IV consultation, a staff visit in
February 2015, mission in April 2015 to negotiate a new ECF-supported program, and assistances
with capacity development in the areas of public financial management, revenue administration,
statistics, monetary liquidity management, and banking supervision.
4.
The Bank and the Fund are providing complementary support to help São Tomé and
Príncipe strengthen public financial management and make progress toward debt sustainability.
Regarding the latter, the teams prepared a Joint IMF-World Bank Debt Sustainability Analysis (DSA)
update in 2014, and a new update has recently been prepared to accompany the new
ECF-supported program request.

RELATIONS WITH THE AFRICAN DEVELOPMENT BANK
GROUP
(As of May, 2016)
1.
São Tomé and Príncipe (STP) became a member of the African Development Bank Group
(AfDB) in 1976. To date, the AfDB has financed 40 operations in the country. This comprises of
30 projects, including institutional support, and 10 studies, for a total net commitment of
UA 134 million under the African Development Fund (ADF) (98.9 percent), and one special support
operation of UA 1 million under the Nigeria Trust Fund (NTF). The vast majority of these operations
(94 percent) were financed through loans with the remaining 6 percent through grants.
2.
As of May 31, 2016, the AfDB’s ongoing portfolio comprised of six active projects for a total
commitment of UA 26.2 million. These are: the Infrastructure Rehabilitation for Food Security
(PRIASA I); Infrastructure Rehabilitation for Food Security (PRIASA II); the Public Finance
Management Project (PAGEF); the National Planning Scheme study; the Study on Water Supply and
Sanitation Programme Rural; the Trade Facilitation project (second phase of ASYCUDA); (Table 1).
The portfolio is relatively young. The average age of the ongoing portfolio is 3 years against
5.4 years recorded in 2011. Such improvement is mainly linked to new projects approved in the
first quarter of 2013 and 2015. The portfolio’s average disbursement rate stands at 25.8 percent
lower than 29.3 percent reported in the last portfolio review conducted in 2014. In terms of sector
distribution, agriculture contributes a substantial proportion, representing 71 percent of the total
value of the portfolio, followed by multi-sector (26 percent) and water and sanitation (3 percent).
There is no ongoing private sector or multinational projects.
3.
The AfDB current involvement in STP is guided by the Country Strategy Paper (CSP)
2012–16, approved in July 2012. The CSP’s main objective is to prepare the authorities for the
forthcoming oil production era and the associated challenges and risks to the country’s socioeconomic development. A mid-term review of the strategy was concluded in 2014. During the
review process the AfDB and the government agreed to add a second pillar in order to respond to
the country’s development needs. Therefore, the AfDB’s strategy focuses on Pillar I- Strengthening
Governance; and Pillar II- Promotion of Agriculture Infrastructure. Both pillars are consistent with
the authorities’ priorities as well as with the AfDB’s priorities outlined in the 2013–2022 strategy for
the continent. More specifically, the strategy aims at improving the capacity of key public
administration institutions, including human resource development, country systems, and strategic
legal and regulatory frameworks by the time the oil era begins. In addition, it will also help to
address the issues of food security, job creation, transformation of local products and global value
chains.
4.
As part of its strategy and knowledge products, the AfDB also envisages to undertake the
following economic and sector works: (i) the study on agriculture transformation; (ii) the study on
national planning scheme; and (iii) the study on accreditation of the agriculture research and
investigation centre (CIAT). In addition, the AfDB also concluded the private sector strategy
INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF SÃO TOMÉ AND PRÍNCIPE

2015–2024 for STP. Within the context of its project, the AfDB will also undertake the following
studies; (i) study on the accreditation of the Technology and Agronomic Centre (CIAT); (ii) study on
the cartography and selectivity of energy including network protection of EMAE-Electricity and
Water Company). STP reached the Highly Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) decision and completion
points in 2000 and 2007, respectively. To this effect, the country became eligible for the MDRI with
an estimated US$99.56 million in debt service according to the terms of the MDRI. The AfDB’s total
assistance under HIPC and MDRI amounted to US$187.92 million in debt relief. At the end of
December 2008, the AfDB provided US$13.33 million in debt relief under HIPC and US$99 million
under MDRI.

STATISTICAL ISSUES
(As of April, 2016)
I. Assessment of Data Adequacy for Surveillance
General: Economic data are broadly adequate for surveillance. At the same time, serious financial,
human, and technological resource constraints have slowed down efforts to strengthen the
statistical system.
National Accounts: Statistics on GDP/GNP are compiled on a yearly basis and provided at the time
of the Article IV consultation and program review missions. Weak source data affect the quality
national accounts estimates. A technical assistance mission is planned early during FY2017 to further
help (i) change the base year of GDP series to 2008; (ii) assist the authorities to improve the flash
GDP estimates based on high frequency indicators; and (iii) migrate the GDP series to an improved
statistical platform that better captures survey and market information and includes estimates of the
informal sector.
The current GDP series (base year 2001) became available in mid–2011. Compared with the previous
series, the revised ones reflect more accurately recent economic developments. While the revision of
the GDP series represented a significant improvement, a number of shortcomings remain.
Further improvements would require input from the recently completed household expenditure
survey (rather than living conditions survey), using producer prices, and better estimates for
agricultural production.
Consumer Price Statistics: From January 2016, the INE is disseminating a new CPI
(base 100 = 2014). With the assistance of AFRISTAT, the product mix was changed and the weights
were updated, using the results of a household expenditure survey conducted in 2010. Due to
financial constraints, the new CPI only covers the capital city.
Government Finance Statistics: Detailed revenue and expenditure data are compiled and reported
to AFR. The main areas that need to be strengthened are (i) monitoring of expenditures on projects
financed by donors; and (ii) financing operations. All project loans financed by donors are
programmed in the budget, but some are executed independently. The government has requested
development partners to help in recording all external financing in the budget. The recording of
financing operations and stocks is expected to improve since the debt data management capacity is
expected to be strengthened.
The 2010 government accounts were finalized and presented to the Court of Audit in June 2013
(the first time in over two decades that government accounts have been prepared and submitted).
The authorities are working on the 2011 and 2012 government accounts, but preparing the latter
using the accounting feature of SAFE-e has taken longer than expected, highlighting the need for
additional technical assistance and training in this area.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF SÃO TOMÉ AND PRÍNCIPE

An October 2004 government finance statistics (GFS) mission helped the Ministry of Finance to
compile and disseminate GFS for the general government in accordance with the Government
Finance Statistics Manual 2001 (GFSM 2001). The mission prepared bridge tables between national
budget classification and GFSM 2001 classifications to be used to compile GFS for reporting to STA
and AFR, as well as in Ministry of Finance policy work. The mission also reviewed the classification of
oil revenues under the Oil Revenue Management Law and made recommendations on classification
of such transactions. A September 2007 follow-up mission found some progress with regard to the
recommendations made by the 2004 mission. In particular, in January 2007 a new budget law was
approved that significantly improved national budget classifications. More recently, the authorities
are revising all financial statements of government operations for 2010 through 2014 and GFS series
are expected to be aligned by July. Notwithstanding these efforts, faster statistical progress is
hampered by an inadequate accounting system. Successive FAD missions aimed at improving public
accounting have begun to address this issue.
Monetary and Financial Statistics: STA missions provided technical assistance on monetary
statistics in December 2004, April/May 2006, June 2007 and September 2010. As a result, the
accuracy and timeliness of the monetary data reported in the standardized report forms (SRF) for
the central bank and the other depository corporations’ data improved significantly. The BCSTP was
reporting monthly data to STA for the central bank and other depository corporations (ODCs) on
regular basis, but since February 2015 stopped the data transmission, notwithstanding repeated
requests from STA to resume reporting.
The BCSTP monthly trial balance sheet is broadly adequate to compile monetary statistics in line
with the Monetary and Financial Statistics Manual (MFSM).
A new plan of accounts for ODCs was introduced in January 2010. The September 2010 mission
reviewed the new plan of accounts for the financial system, and found it adequate for a proper
classification, sectorization, and valuation of financial instruments, and in line with the methodology
of the MFSM. However, the mission detected serious shortcomings in the information reported by
some banks and an inconsistent approach in the way banks report to the BCSTP. Following the
mission’s recommendations, the BCSTP worked towards eliminating those problems. The central
bank has begun to collect data from insurance companies which opened in the past few years.
The asset sizes of insurance companies remain small enough not to warrant inclusion in monetary
statistics at this time.
The central bank produces a quarterly FSI table. MCM TA missions on banking supervision have
helped expand the coverage of the table and improved the data quality. The additional information
compiled could permit the beginning of stress testing exercises in the near future. STA contacted
the BCSTP to receive FSI data on a regular basis according to the methodology of the FSI
Compilation Guide for their posting on the IMF’s website: after an initial exchange, the BCSTP
stopped responding to STA’s requests.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF SÃO TOMÉ AND PRÍNCIPE

External Sector Statistics: The BCSTP compiles quarterly balance of payments statistics consistent
with the guidelines of the sixth edition of the Balance of Payments and International Investment
Position Manual (BPM6) which was implemented in 2014. Quarterly IIP data on a BPM6 basis
(for December 2014 and March 2015) were submitted to STA in June 2015 during a TA mission.
However, since then the BCSTP has not submitted additional IIP data. The BCSTP should compile
and submit quarterly IIP data for later periods consistent with the balance of payments data.
The BCSTP has recently started conducting quarterly surveys to collect balance of payments and IIP
data from the private sector and improve the coverage of the external sector statistics (ESS).
However, the response rates of the surveys addressed to the nonfinancial private sector and oil and
gas sector need to improve and these data should be carefully validated before addition to the ESS
to assure the accuracy of the disseminated data. The net errors and omissions figures for 2014 are
still very large.
A June 2015 mission recommended improving coordination and data sharing among dataproducing agencies, increasing staff dedicated to the compilation and collection of ESS, and
discussing with the Joint Development Authority the establishment of mechanisms for receiving
regular data on production sharing agreement contracts. The National Petroleum Agency has
started submitting regular data.
The authorities have built on previous efforts to strengthen debt data management, and a unit was
created in late 2003 within the Ministry of Finance. The Commonwealth Secretariat debt recording
and management system is being operationalized.
II. Data Standards and Quality
São Tomé and Príncipe has participated in the Fund’s General Data Dissemination System (GDDS)
since April 20, 2004. Currently, it is in its successor data dissemination initiative, eGDDS.

Democratic Republic of São Tomé and Príncipe: Table of Common Indicators Required for Surveillance
(As of April 30,2016)

STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2016 ARTICLE IV CONSULTATION,

PERFORMANCE CRITERION AND MODIFICATION OF
PERFORMANCE CRITERIA—DEBT SUSTAINABILITY
ANALYSIS UPDATE1

May 20, 2016

Approved By
David Owen and Andrea Richter
Hume (IMF) and John Panzer (IDA)

Prepared by:
International Monetary Fund and International
Development Association staffs in collaboration
with the authorities of São Tomé and Príncipe.

Risk of external debt distress:
Augmented by significant risks stemming from domestic public
and/or private external debt?

HIGH
NO

The update of analysis based on the joint IMF-World Bank debt sustainability
framework (DSF) for low income countries shows that São Tomé and Príncipe is at
a high risk of debt distress. The assessment of high risk of debt distress is unchanged
from the previous Debt Sustainability Analysis (DSA). This update reflects US$14 million of
planned new borrowing in 2016, recent economic data and forecasts, including a slightly
lower than originally projected end-2015 debt stock out-turns. Debt ratios are projected to
follow roughly the same trajectories as in the previous DSA. The risks continue
manageable over the medium term if the authorities are able to move forward with a
planned fiscal adjustment of 1.5 percent of GDP over 2016–18, and they stay committed
to mainly grants and concessional borrowing to fund the public investment program from
2016 onwards.

The DSA update was prepared by IMF and World Bank staff in collaboration with the authorities of São Tomé
and Príncipe. The analysis updates the previous Joint DSA dated June 24, 2015
(IMF Country Report No. 15/196, Supplement 2). The DSA follows the IMF and World Bank Staff Guidance
Note on the Application of the Joint Fund-Bank Debt Sustainability Framework for Low-Income Countries
(November 5, 2013). The DSA uses the unified discount rate of 5 percent set out in Decision No 15462
(October 11, 2013). São Tomé and Príncipe’s CPIA score of 3.05 classifies it as a weak performer.
The corresponding indicative thresholds are: 30 percent for the NPV of debt-to-GDP ratio; 100 percent for the
NPV of debt-to-export ratio; 200 percent for NPV of debt-to-revenue ratio; 15 percent for the debt service-toexports ratio; and 18 percent for the debt service-to-revenue ratio.

A. Underlying Assumptions
1.
The basic macroeconomic assumptions have changed little from those in the previous
DSA. The long-term forecasts for growth, inflation and the primary deficit are essentially unchanged.
Exports and imports growths are also unchanged belittling decline in their levels in 2015 with forward
rippled effects. Moreover, there is a marked improvement in the long term current account deficit on
account of lower commodities prices and slightly lower FDI.

2.
The 2016 DSA starts with a lower stock of external debt in comparison to the previous
DSA because actual borrowing and disbursements in 2015 were lower than projected. Staff had
projected US$35 million in new concessional borrowing in 2015. The actual new borrowing and
disbursement of new loan in 2015 ended up US$5 million and US$20 million lower respectively.
This resulted in a lower PV of debt-to-GDP ratio in 2015 under the current DSA. The HIPC initiative
legacy arrears which were included in the historical stock of external debt but excluded from PV
calculations in the previous DSAs on the assumption of expected forgiveness have been completely
excluded in this DSA. Their exclusion does not impact debt trajectory.

B. External DSA
3.
Like the previous DSA, the three solvency-based indicators remain significantly above
their relevant indicative thresholds over the next few years (Figures 1 and 3). However, the PV of
PPG external debt- to-exports and to-revenue ratios deteriorate slightly, prolonging periods of the
breach of the thresholds by one year relative to the previous DSA. This is due mainly to the level effects
of lower 2015 revenue and exports on their projected values. The PV of public and publicly guaranteed
(PPG) external debt-to-GDP ratio follows broadly similar trajectory as in the previous DSA, breaching the
thresholds until 2022 and remain below thereafter. All indicators of debt service remain below their
respective thresholds while showing a modest improvement in the early years of projection relative to
2

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

DEMOCRATIC REPUBLIC OF SÃO TOMÉ AND PRÍNCIPE

the previous DSA due to lower actual disbursements in 2015. Historical scenarios (Figure 1, red dashed
lines) for all debt indicators present a generally more deteriorated picture than the previous DSA
because of both lower growth and higher primary deficit in 2015. Large residuals in 2016–19 which are
in line with recent history are mainly explained by net private financial inflows2, drawdown from the
National Oil account and price changes.
4.
Stress tests show the highest vulnerability of debt sustainability extends the period of
breach of thresholds for a few additional years beyond those observed in the baseline (Figure 1,
solid black lines).3 The export based indicators are most sensitive to exports shocks while the remaining
indicators are most sensitive to a one-time depreciation shock.

C. Public DSA
5.
There is essentially no difference between the external and public sector DSAs4. The debt
indicators continue to rise throughout the projection period when real GDP growth and the primary
balance are at historical averages (Figure 2, grey dashed line) or when the primary balance is unchanged
from 2016 (Figure 2, red dashed line). These shocks highlight the importance of continued fiscal
prudence to ensure debt sustainability and structural reforms to improve the business environment and
thus support private sector led growth. Public debt-to-GDP is most sensitive to a worsening primary
balance while the public debt and debt service-to-revenue ratios are most sensitive to worsening
primary balance and a one-time 30 percent depreciation of the dobra.

D. Conclusion
6.
São Tomé and Príncipe remains at a high risk of external debt distress. However, the
country is able to service its current obligations and while some external debt indicators are projected
to remain above their respective thresholds they show a clear downward trend in the long term. In this
context, to mitigate risks, the DSA underlines the need for the authorities to:


Maintain an adequate level of international reserves to reinforce the peg and boost
confidence in the wake of reduced oil prospects;



Maintain fiscal prudence, particularly in the run-up to the 2016 presidential elections;



Accelerate reforms to improve policy and institutional performance to enhance the growth
potential of the country;



Ensure favorable financing terms in the form of grants or concessional borrowing; and

2

The stock of private sector external debt is not included in the DSA as there is no reliable data.

3

In the previous DSA, the country’s debt stock indicators were most vulnerable to non-debt flows shocks while
debt service indicators were most vulnerable to exports and one-time depreciation shocks.
4

Fuel products supplier (ENCO)’s domestic claims on the central government were not included pending the
conclusion of formal review to establish the definitive amount.



Develop and implement a comprehensive strategy to reduce the cost of doing business and
attract private investment that can broaden the export base.

7.
The biggest risks to external debt sustainability come from exchange rate shocks and
shocks to export growth. Debt sustainability could also deteriorate in the event of sharp increase in
the international prices of fuel and other commodities, raising the import bill and putting pressure on
the current account. The risks appear manageable over the medium term if the authorities are able to
move forward with the planned fiscal adjustment in the coming years and build international reserves
buffer. The development of sound public debt management, anchored in a medium-term debt
management strategy and medium-term fiscal framework, will be essential to guide prioritization of the
future public investments and their financing.

Includes both public and private sector external debt.
Derived as [r - g - ρ(1+g)]/(1+g+ρ+gρ) times previous period debt ratio, with r = nominal interest rate; g = real GDP growth rate, and ρ = growth rate of GDP deflator in U.S. dollar terms.
Includes exceptional financing (i.e., changes in arrears and debt relief); changes in gross foreign assets; and valuation adjustments. For projections also includes contribution from price and exchange rate changes.
Assumes that PV of private sector debt is equivalent to its face value.
Current-year interest payments divided by previous period debt stock.
Historical averages and standard deviations are generally derived over the past 10 years, subject to data availability.
Defined as grants, concessional loans, and debt relief.
Grant-equivalent financing includes grants provided directly to the government and through new borrowing (difference between the face value and the PV of new debt).

1/ Variables include real GDP growth, growth of GDP deflator (in U.S. dollar terms), non-interest current account in percent of GDP, and non-debt creating flows.
2/ Assumes that the interest rate on new borrowing is by 2 percentage points higher than in the baseline., while grace and maturity periods are the same as in the baseline.
3/ Exports values are assumed to remain permanently at the lower level, but the current account as a share of GDP is assumed to return to its baseline level after the shock
(implicitly assuming an offsetting adjustment in import levels).
4/ Includes official and private transfers and FDI.
5/ Depreciation is defined as percentage decline in dollar/local currency rate, such that it never exceeds 100 percent.
6/ Applies to all stress scenarios except for A2 (less favorable financing) in which the terms on all new financing are as specified in footnote 2.

Statement by Mr. Yambaye, Executive Director
and Mr. Lopes Varela, Advisor to the Executive Director,
on the Democratic Republic of São Tomé and Príncipe
June 10, 2016
On behalf of our São Toméan authorities, we would like to express our gratitude to the
Board, Management and Staff for their continued support and valuable advice to São Tomé
and Príncipe. The authorities are thankful to Fund Staff for the constructive discussions held
in São Tomé in March 2016, during the 2016 Article IV Consultation and the first review of
São Tomé and Príncipe’s economic program supported by the Extended Credit Facility
(ECF).
The authorities have made great efforts in achieving macroeconomic stability, sustainable
economic growth and poverty reduction under the National Poverty Reduction Strategy
Paper (PRSP-II), including improving macroeconomic stability, stabilizing economic growth,
and declining inflation. Despite this progress, the economy continues to face significant
challenges in terms of rising public debt and weak competitiveness. The authorities broadly
concur with the main policy recommendations of the staff report as a support for better
implementation of PRSP-II.
As regards performance under the ECF, all end-December 2015 performance criteria (PC)
were met with exception of just one. The PC on domestic primary deficit was missed by a
small margin, about 0.3 percent of GDP, due mainly to tax revenue underperformance and
the absence of corresponding expenditure cuts. Regarding structural reforms, the authorities
have made strong progress by implementing all structural benchmarks through endDecember, including the new banking law and two other measures related to improvements
in the national accounts and consumer price statistics. Overall performance is satisfactory
and the program is on track.
RECENT ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS AND PERFORMANCE UNDER THE ECF
ARRANGEMENT
Although highly vulnerable to external shocks, the economy of São Tomé and Príncipe has
grown faster than many small islands states, with average GDP growth over 4 percent per
year since 2012. However, as noted by staff, these macroeconomic performance has not been
sufficiently strong and diversified to improve economic prospects and reduce poverty
significantly. Real GDP growth is estimated to have fallen below the budget target of
5 percent in 2015, by almost 1 percentage point, mainly due to late approval of the 2015
budget-which slowed down the execution pace of public investment projects-and poor rains,
that resulted in a decrease of agricultural output (cocoa production). Helped by weakened
demand and falling international prices of oil and other commodities, inflation has fallen to
its lowest level in two decades, from 28 percent to below 5 percent at end December 2015.

2
In the fiscal area, the authorities’ efforts have been affected by lower than expected tax
revenue and donor budget support. As a result, the domestic primary deficit was 0.3 percent
of GDP, higher than the program target of 2.7 percent of GDP. Lower collection of arrears is
a main cause of the tax revenue short fall, although more arrears were collected in 2015
(24 percentage points) compared to 2014. Efforts to increase arrears collection are being
strengthened.
The authorities have also started to implement a comprehensive plan to clear the outstanding
stock of arrears, including to the oil importing company (ENCO) and the state utility
company (EMAE). In this regard, it is worth noting that the government has cleared all
arrears to EMAE in 2015, 1.2 percent of GDP (0.5 percent of GDP higher than budgeted).
EMAE in turn paid the equivalent of 2.6 percent of GDP of its arrears to ENCO. For its part
the government will start clearing its arrears to ENCO this year and provision has been made
accordingly in the 2016 budget. In addition, the automatic fuel price adjustment mechanism
will also be implemented and will help to prevent accumulation of new arrears.
In line with the weaker economic activity and contraction in oil and other commodity
imports, the external current account deficit declined to 17 percent of GDP in 2015, which
offset the drop in cocoa exports as production declined. Gross international reserves
remained at a comfortable level of 4.4 months of imports cover at end 2015.
Monetary policy has been adversely affected by the excess liquidity, low profitability, and
high NPLs in the economy. The capital adequacy ratio for the entire banking system fell from
20.3 percent in December 2014 to 15.5 percent at the end of 2015, while capital to riskweighted assets ratio increased to 24.1 percent from 22.6 percent, following recent capital
injections by several banks. NPLs increased to a record high of about 30 percent in 2015,
following the reclassification of overdue overdrafts in Banco Equador’s books as bad loans
and a downgrade in a sizeable share of the largest bank’s loan classification to loss.
2016 AND MEDIUM-TERM POLICIES
The prospects for São Tomé and Príncipe are favorable in the near term but challenges
remain. On the basis of higher and timely execution of public investments, recovery in cocoa
production and increased foreign direct investment (FDI) in the tourism sector, real GDP is
projected to grow by 5 percent in 2016. Inflation is expected to remain around 4 percent
aided by falling international prices of food and petroleum products.
Over the medium term, real GDP growth is expected to be maintained at 5 percent; inflation
is expected to continue to decline to 3 percent; and the current account deficit contracting
further.
In the fiscal area, the authorities remain committed to bring the primary deficit down to
around 1–1 ½ percent of GDP by 2018 and to ensure that debt remains on a downward path.

3
At the same time the authorities will take steps to create fiscal space to meet the expenditure
need for domestically-financed infrastructure spending to complement donor support.
To achieve these objectives, the authorities will strengthen revenue collection efforts through
a combination of tax policies (including the introduction of VAT), and customs and tax
administration measures as well as improving the quality of spending.

Various measures will be implemented to attain this objective, including, greater and more
rigorous audits, improving the capacity and incentives at the large taxpayer unit, increasing
the number of products subject to imposition of minimum custom value, and introducing a
number of legislative changes. The authorities will also submit to the National Assembly a
new VAT law, a step toward to the introduction of VAT.
On the expenditures side, the authorities are focused on strengthening public financial
management and transparency. They intend to steadfastly implement key measures, notably,
rolling out of SAFEe ( the electronic information management system) from the current pilot
stage to cover all ministries and others state institutions to strengthen public financial
oversight; enhancing SAFEe with added functionality such as reconciliation of treasury bank
accounts, revenue tracking, management of fixed assets and a government contracts registry
to facilitate the preparation of more comprehensive general government accounts. In
addition, the authorities intend to move towards medium-term fiscal and expenditure
frameworks in 2017. As regards, extra budgetary spending in the run-up to the presidential
election, the authorities are fully commitment not to exceed the amount budgeted.
Mindful of the need to preserve debt sustainability, our authorities are committed to
implement the debt framework law and strengthening debt management capacity. In pursuit
of these objectives, among other measures, they will: (i) prepare a national debt strategy, as
required under the debt framework law, that will put a ceiling on the overall debt of the
nonfinancial public sector as well as annual debt policies that fix annual ceilings for each
public entity; (ii) update the medium-term debt management strategy; (iii) seek technical
assistance to prepare a manual of procedures for debt management and to carry out a new
debt management performance assessment (DeMPA) by the end of 2016. Concerning
external borrowing, the authorities will continue to pursue policies consistent with debt
sustainability, by giving priority to concessional financing for infrastructure projects and
social spending.
Monetary Policy
The monetary authorities are focusing their efforts on removing the excess liquidity in the
economy and in this regard the central bank of São Tomé and Príncipe (BCSTP) has
introduced the interbank market and treasury bills. In addition, the BCSTP is working
towards developing a treasury bonds market, creating the conditions for longer-term liquidity
management, as well as developing the secondary market.

4
The BCSP has continued its efforts in developing monetary liquidity management framework
by implementing a new payment methodology for the commercial banks in 2015, to allow
payment orders issued by the Treasury to commercial banks in a given period to be paid in
the following period, thus enabling the BCSTP to include them in its liquidity forecasting,
considerably reducing forecasting errors.
Macro-Financial Linkages and Financial Sector Stability
The authorities are mindful of the need to address the weakness in the financial sector, as to
enhance fiscal and financial stability to support growth. In this regard, The BCSTP has been
making efforts to strengthen its capacity in banking regulation and supervision. Three out of
seven banks increased their capital in the last quarter of 2015, to meet the minimum
requirement. BCSTP is at the early stage of building adequate crisis management and bank
resolution frameworks to deal with risks in the financial system. The new banking resolution
law provides the legal framework for a swift and orderly resolution of banks, including
Banco Equador. A transition bank is being created with quality assets and liabilities of Banco
Equador, and steps are being taken to identify potential buyers and conclude the process
within 1 year from the establishment of the transition bank.
In order to reverse the trend of NPLs and credit to the private sector, the BCSTP is
implementing necessary measures to tackle the large stock of NPLs, notably by stocktaking,
provisioning and recapitalizing specific banks if needed, conduct detailed asset quality
reviews for all banks to reduce the uncertainty surrounding bank assets, and where necessary
demand recapitalization of affected banks.
Furthermore, the authorities will take additional measures to address other weakness in the
financial sector, including, improving the coverage and effectiveness of the credit reference
bureaus, streamlining procedures to ensure collateral enforcement, and capacity building of
SMEs in basic accounting, financial management, and preparation of bankable projects.
Improving Competitiveness and Setting the Stage for Sustainable and Inclusive Growth
The authorities recognize the need to promote private sector-led growth in order to set the
stage for higher and sustainable growth. Consistent with this goal, our authorities have listed
in their 2030 Transformation Agenda the priorities for medium to long-term growth, social
cohesion and external credibility, including diversifying the economy, broadening the
production base, and modernizing the economic and social infrastructure. In addition, the
authorities are seeking to create the conditions conducive to support the traditional sectors,
such as agriculture, fisheries, and tourism to boost job creation and reduce poverty.
In order to maximize the great tourism potential, the authorities are focusing their efforts on
medium-term structural reforms on high-yielding tourism activities, broader diversification
of source markets, and more open, competitive air transport connections. They will also

5
continue efforts to diversify tourism source markets and take steps to support open,
competitive air transport policy, including allowing direct links to the sub region.
Furthermore, they will seek to implement policy initiatives in 2016 aimed at introducing
targeted reforms to improve the indicators in the World Bank’s Doing Business survey, and
pursue efforts to encourage diversification of production and exports.
CONCLUSION
Our São Toméan authorities remain committed to fiscal prudence and to undertake crucial
reforms so as to lower the public debt level and increase São Tome and Principe’s
competitiveness and business environment. They will also continue their efforts in
enhancing liquidity management and banking supervision in order to maintain financial
stability. In this regard, they will rely on the IMF and other partners’ support to help
consolidate their efforts to achieve the goal of sustained growth and poverty reduction.
We therefore, call on Directors for a favorable consideration of our authorities’ request for
the completion of the first review, waiver for nonobservance of performance criterion and
modification of performance criteria.
