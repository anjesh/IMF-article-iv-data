STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2014 ARTICLE IV CONSULTATION
June 11, 2014

KEY ISSUES
Politics: President Bachelet won the Presidential election on a platform to foster
inclusive growth and reduce inequality. Her government took office in March 2014 and
is launching an ambitious policy agenda that includes important reforms in several
areas, including taxation, education, productivity, and energy.
Outlook and risks: Chile’s global environment is shifting, with a dimmer outlook for its
main export, copper, and normalization of global monetary conditions. Growth has
slowed markedly, resulting in a modest output gap. The peso has depreciated, feeding
into inflation. Staff projects growth to bottom out in 2014 and then gradually recover.
Key risks relate to a large and lasting drop in copper prices and global financial volatility.
Policy mix: The freely floating peso is working as a shock absorber and will support the
economic recovery. The policy mix with broadly neutral fiscal and accommodative
monetary policy is appropriate. Room for further monetary easing has narrowed but
space remains if domestic demand flounders, so long as inflation expectations remain
well anchored. On fiscal, given the strong public finances, automatic stabilizers should
be allowed to operate unimpeded and there is space for stimuli in the event of a major
downturn. The commitment to close the structural fiscal deficit by 2018 is appropriate
and should be phased in a way that avoids undue drag on the recovery. Should risks
materialize, the freely floating currency is the first line of defense.
Growth and equity reforms: Achieving strong growth while reducing inequality will
require structural reforms. The authorities’ agenda focuses on the right areas but many
details remain work in progress. Clarity on the details, timetables, and prioritization will
reduce uncertainty and the risk of delays.
Financial stability: Risks to financial stability appear contained, but it will be important
to push through with regulatory reforms underway, including initiatives currently in
Congress. Further effort will be needed to close regulatory gaps, in particular bank
capital requirements, relative to international benchmarks.

CONTEXT
1.
Chile is confronting a changing external environment. As the world’s leading copper
exporter and with a large, internationally integrated financial sector, Chile profited greatly from
recent years’ global copper boom and easy international financial conditions (Figure 1). Chile
achieved a substantial increase in per capita income, a fall in poverty, and an improvement, if more
modest, in its skewed income distribution.1 Growth tailwinds are now reversing as the Fed has
started to normalize policy (“tapering”) and the commodity boom is petering out. Although Chile is
in a strong position to cope with these changes and associated turbulence thanks to its freely
floating currency, credible monetary policy framework, robust public finances, and a track-record of
macro-financial stability, the changing environment poses challenges for macroeconomic policy and,
in particular, for the prospects for strong and more inclusive growth.
2.
A new government has taken office. Former President Michelle Bachelet won the
November 2013 elections and assumed office on March 11, 2014 for a four year term. Her coalition
also won majority in both chambers in Congress. President Bachelet was elected on a platform to
improve equity through major tax and education reforms. The platform also includes energy, labor,
and productivity reforms, and a clear commitment to prudent fiscal policy. Annex I summarizes past
Fund advice.

CURRENT CONDITIONS
3.
So far, spillovers have been mixed: mild from tapering and severe from the dimmer
global copper outlook. Though not immune, Chile has been remarkably resilient to the taperingspillovers (Figure 2). The corporate sector has maintained access to external funding, capital inflows
have remained buoyant, albeit with recent moderation, and the effect on EMBI spreads has been
modest. Notably, Chile’s local currency long-term

The central bank has eased monetary policy. In October 2013, with inflation below target
and a weakening economic outlook, the central bank bucked the tightening trend among emerging
markets and cut the policy rate from 5 to 4 percent by April 2014 (Figure 4). The cuts transmitted
quickly to interbank and lending rates, and added to peso depreciation. Nonetheless, credit growth
has moderated for all types of credit, except for mortgages, which remain brisk.

Inflation has picked up. The pass through
from peso depreciation to consumer prices has been
surprisingly swift. Inflation was 4.3 percent (y/y) in
April, up from 1.7 percent in October 2013. More
worrisome, although the largest spike was in tradable
goods inflation, as would be expected, non-tradable
and core inflation measures have also risen. Still,
inflation expectations remain anchored at 3 percent
over the two-year policy horizon.

7.
Fiscal policy has stayed broadly neutral (Figure 5). The structural deficit in 2013 was
0.8 percent of GDP (staff estimate), roughly unchanged from 2012 net of a one-off capital gains tax
windfall (equal to 0.4 percent of GDP). The fiscal stance, measured by staff as the change in the nonmining primary structural balance, was broadly neutral. The fall in copper revenue shifted the
headline balance to a deficit of 0.6 percent of GDP from a surplus of equal size in 2012, but central
government net assets remained at 6.7 percent of GDP helped by valuation gains.

financing, albeit with a growing debt component. According to
the Fund’s EBA estimates, the peso is in line with fundamentals, and this view is supported by a
broader set of indicators—brisk (copper and non-copper) export volume growth, adequate reserves,
and strong international investment position (Figure 6). That said, external debt has increased and
gross external financing needs, though smaller than in 2013, remain sizeable at 17 percent of GDP,
roughly half of which is non-bank corporate debt.

conservatively tend to accumulate more capital than required by regulations and solvency
requirements are being strengthened. In recent years, the sector has expanded into lower-liquidity,
higher-risk investments (e.g., real estate). As for corporates in the context of easy global financial
conditions, firms have increased their indebtedness to about 92 percent of GDP, surpassing precrisis levels, though most of the increase reflects FDI-related debt with likely less roll-over risk
(Annex III).
10.
Real estate remains dynamic. Real mortgage credit expanded by 9 percent (y/y) in April,
and house prices, following some deceleration, are rising again though with large regional variation
(Figure 8). However, household indebtedness (mostly bank-financed) has remained broadly stable at
about 55 percent of disposable income. Commercial real estate data are spottier, but an apparent
oversupply of office space poses some risk to life insurers.

2016. But there is a clear risk that the recovery could be
underpowered and bumpy, held back by sluggish private consumption, near-term policy
uncertainty, and international shocks. Inflation will decline to 3 percent over the next 12–18 months
as the temporary effects from the peso depreciation wears off.

12.

Two risks dominate the outlook (Annex IV).



Copper prices. Copper represents over half of Chile’s
exports, equaling 15 percent of GDP. A further sharp
and sustained decline in copper prices—triggered, for
example, by a drop in demand from China (which
consumes about 40 percent of world copper)—would
hurt investment, crimp growth, and require another
round of substantial real depreciation. Previous staff
analysis suggested that a 10 percent fall in copper
prices reduces Chile’s GDP by 0.8 percent over eight
quarters.

Global financial volatility. Financial spillovers to Chile from tapering and emerging market
turmoil have been muted. And as shown in the Spring 2014 World Economic Outlook, Chile is
less vulnerable to capital flow volatility than most other emerging markets thanks to its
robust macroeconomic framework and deep local capital market (including large pension
funds). Still, Chile’s large and internationally integrated financial system, the significant realfinancial linkages, the increased corporate leverage, and the sizeable gross external financing
need expose Chile to sudden stop risk.

13.
The authorities are in the process of reassessing their macroeconomic forecasts but
broadly agreed with staff on the outlook and risks. On external risks, they saw a disorderly
slowdown in China as most important, especially if associated with further postponement of copperrelated investment projects. On financial spillover risks, they no longer see tapering as an
immediate risk, as the earlier uncertainty has been resolved, but will remain vigilant of any major
deviations from announced plans. Medium-term growth prospects and potential growth should
improve with implementation of structural reforms.

CHILE

POLICY IMPLICATIONS
Given the structural character of the growth slowdown and the modest-sized output gap, structural
reform rather than demand-side policies should have the primary role in strengthening prospects for
strong and inclusive growth. Continued efforts to reinforce financial stability will also be important.

A. Policy mix
14.
Monetary policy should remain vigilant to the inflation outlook. The present
accommodative stance is consistent with keeping inflation in check over the policy horizon and
supporting the baseline’s recovery. However, the recent broad-based spurt in inflation calls for
caution and for interest rates to be left on hold absent a further weakening in domestic demand.
Monetary policy normalization should proceed as the economy reverts toward potential.
15.
A broadly neutral fiscal stance would be appropriate. It would be consistent with full
execution of the 2014 budget (approved last year with a structural deficit of 1 percent of GDP) and
would allow for a robust increase in expenditure, investment in particular, after under-execution in
2013. At the same time, the headline deficit will double to 1.2 percent of GDP and central
government net assets will decline by about 1 percentage point. The government’s target of a
balanced structural position by 2018 is welcome and should be feasible as activity recovers, though
the consolidation should be calibrated to avoid an unduly contractionary stance. The strong public
finances allow for automatic stabilizers to operate fully.
16.
There is room to react if risks materialize. The floating exchange rate should be the first
line of defense, in particular in case of a further sharp and lasting fall in copper prices and capital
flow reversals. Foreign exchange intervention could help avoid excessive currency volatility, if
needed. If domestic demand falters, further monetary easing could be appropriate though room has
shrunk. Fiscal support—beyond automatic stabilizers—could be considered if there is a large decline
in activity. In the event of a capital flow reversal, the authorities should also be prepared to contain
liquidity pressures, including through expanding repo operations, broadening the range of accepted
collateral, and setting up dollar swap auctions.
17.
The authorities broadly agreed. The central bank stressed that monetary policy will
continue to focus on inflation. The pick-up in inflation had been stronger than expected but the
central bank was confident that this increase was temporary, as suggested also by market
expectations, and that inflation would revert toward 3 percent during 2015. Still, the rapid rise in
inflation was a concern. Fiscal policy will be cast around a target of a structural balanced position by
2018. The government is considering revisions to the 2014 budget that would likely include
additional outlays relating to costs of the recent earthquake in the north and widespread fires in
Valparaiso. They also noted that the macroeconomic assumptions on which the 2014 budget was
based have turned out to be too optimistic and, therefore, a somewhat larger headline deficit could
be expected this year. The government is committed to bring the structural budget to a balanced
position by 2018 using receipts from tax reform.

B. Fostering strong and inclusive growth
18.
Chile faces two important medium-term challenges: fostering strong and sustained
growth and reducing inequality.




Growth. Rapid growth over the past decade was led by investment and employment
expansion, while total factor productivity increased a paltry 0.4 percent a year (and was
particularly lackluster in the copper sector). The shifting tailwinds raise doubts about the
mining sector as a driver for future growth—even if some recovery is projected—and the
scope for employment expansion is constrained by low unemployment and the decelerating
working-age population (from 1.6 percent in 2013 to 1.1 percent by 2019).The floating
exchange rate and the flexible labor market will be key in facilitating the needed economic
adjustment. But fostering strong and sustained growth will also require structural reforms.

Equity. Inequality has declined but it remains high compared with the region and OECD
countries. Chile’s inequality is reflected also in low intergenerational social mobility, which is
largely caused by unequal access to quality education. Social public spending has risen
significantly over the last two decades, especially on health and education, but still lags
regional and OECD averages. The Chilean tax-transfer system is characterized by low
progressivity and has been less effective in reducing poverty and income inequality
compared with the experience in OECD.3

The government is launching an ambitious policy agenda that could galvanize strong
and inclusive growth, while preserving Chile’s record of prudent macroeconomic policy. The
plans, most of which are under development, focus on the following areas:
Education and tax reforms. The government has proposed a major tax reform to reduce
regressivity and raise 3 percent of GDP by 2018 in revenue to fund education reform,
increase outlays on health, and raise public savings (see Box 2). The mission supported these
objectives. The proposal prudently matches new spending with permanent revenue.

region but still well below OECD averages. In Chile, student performance is also highly

 Tax reform (Box 2). The reform involves several changes to Chile’s integrated tax
regime.6 The current system of tax deferral for undistributed earnings (in place since
1984) has become a source of significant tax planning and evasion—mainly benefitting
those with higher incomes—and challenging to administer. The tax reform (expected to
be approved in September 2014) is tilted toward taxing the upper-income brackets,
including through its focus on capital income and closing loopholes, and should reduce
the regressivity of the current tax system. Given the size and complexity of the reform
there is some uncertainty over its expected revenue yield and economic impact. Further,
there is not much international experience to draw on for the proposed new
profit/dividend tax regime but higher taxation of corporate profits and capital income
would likely dampen investment and, in particular, corporate savings, while instant
depreciation and higher public savings would provide some offset. Strengthening the
tax authority will help support the expected revenue yield; and the planned gradual
implementation is welcome and would allow fine-tuning if needed.




Energy (Box 3). While demand for electricity has risen steadily (and will continue to rise),
investment in the sector, including in generation, has stalled. Energy reform is a top concern
for the business sector and a priority for the government. The mission commended the
government’s plan to promote energy investment and efficiency, and to facilitate entry and
the use of new, clean technologies.

Labor market. The government is considering a
number of labor market reforms. The mission encouraged in particular reforms to promote
female labor force participation (e.g., training and improved access to daycare), which,
despite important progress over the last decade lags OECD and regional averages and is
particularly low for lower-income groups. As for the minimum wage, which is quite binding
in Chile, the government’s commitment implies an increase by about 20 percent over three
years at the time of a weaker labor market. The mission stressed the importance of
maintaining a labor market that allows for sufficient flexibility while fostering equity.

The authorities emphasized that the reform agenda is designed to provide a strong
boost to medium-term growth and achieve a fairer distribution of income, which is important
for social stability. The tax reform will bring needed fresh fiscal resources that will be used
prudently on education and health and on increasing public savings. Improving access to high
quality education will strengthen long-term growth prospects but also attack a root cause of
inequality. And the planned agendas for energy reform and productivity, innovation and growth will
address the main concerns of Chilean industry. All in all, the authorities were convinced that the
implementation of their bold reform program should have an important positive impact on
medium-term growth prospects and potential output.

C. Reinforcing financial stability
21.
Chile’s financial system is large, with significant links to the local economy, the region,
and the rest of the world. Financial system assets exceed 200 percent of GDP. Chilean banks (and
corporations) are net borrowers in world markets. Subsidiaries of foreign banks account for a large
share of bank assets. Foreign participation is also

22.
Chile has made considerable progress in
enhancing oversight, but further efforts would
strengthen the resilience of the system. Much of
the progress has built on the 2011 FSAP (Annex V).
But important parts of the agenda remain unfinished.
The mission encouraged the new authorities to push
forward with reforms to buttress the resilience of the
bank and nonbank system.

Financial Sector Reforms in Progress
1. Legal reforms currently in Congress
Risk-based insurance supervision
Comprehensive credit registry
Stronger governance and independence for the Securities and Insurance
Superintendence (SVS)
New legal framework for the Financial Stability Council, improving
coordination and data sharing
2. Regulatory changes currently under public consultation
Standardized bank mortgage credit provisioning model linked to LTV levels
Enhanced liquidity regulation and reporting, in line with Basel III
Source: National authorities.

23.
Banking sector soundness is being reinforced. While bank soundness indicators do not
point to immediate risks, real estate, funding, and corporate leverage developments merit watching.


Real estate exposure. Mortgage loans represent about one-quarter of banks’ loan portfolio
and the share of mortgages with elevated (80 percent or higher) loan-to-value (LTV) ratios
has stabilized at a relatively high 60 percent. Prompt implementation of regulation underway
linking mortgage credit provisioning to LTV levels would be important, and further action
(hard limits on LTVs and debt-to-income ratios) might need to be considered. The mission
also encouraged the authorities to address real estate data gaps, in particular for
commercial real estate.



Bank funding. The banking system’s loan-to-deposits ratio—an often-used measure of
liquidity risk—is high by international comparisons.8 The main reason is its heavier reliance
on institutional deposits and, on the asset side, its higher share of loans. The Basel III Net
Stable Funding Ratio (NSFR) is a broader measure and the 2011 FSAP Update found Chilean
banks well-positioned to meet the NSFR. The mission welcomed the work of the
Superintendence of Banks and Financial Institutions (SBIF) and the Central Bank to enhance
liquidity regulation and reporting, taking into consideration recent proposals of the Basel
Committee on Banking Supervision.



Corporate exposure. In recent years, corporate debt has risen (as a share of GDP), and
profits and liquidity ratios have worsened from pre-crisis levels, especially in the construction
and retail trade sectors that also have a large share in bank commercial debt. Corporate
loans represent roughly half of banks’ portfolios, so banks’ exposure is significant. That said,
local and global appetite for Chilean corporate debt remains strong, firms’ currency
mismatches appear limited, and other indicators of corporate debt vulnerabilities do not
point to acute risks (see Annex III). Central bank stress-tests find the banking sector solvent
even under extreme scenarios.9

In a test involving a 6 percentage point output drop relative to baseline and subdued growth over the medium
term, a 300 basis points rise in interest rates in the short term and 100 basis points in the long term, and 20 percent
peso depreciation, all banks maintain regulatory capital to risk-weighted assets above 8 percent.

24.

The soundness of the non-bank system is also being strengthened further.



Insurance companies.10 The important life insurance sector (with assets equal to 20 percent
of GDP) is expected to expand as the number of retirees increase. Longevity risk is being
mitigated by regular review of mortality tables to reflect future life expectancy
improvements, as recommended in the 2004 FSAP. As for credit risk, a longer average
maturity for assets than for liabilities exposes life insurers to a decrease in interest rates. Life
insurers’ growing direct exposure to commercial real estate merits watching, though stress
tests undertaken by the Securities and Insurance Supervisor (SVS) find no significant
concerns. Exposures to domestic corporate bonds (almost one-third of life insurers’
investments) also merit continued monitoring. The mission encouraged speedy approval of
the law now in Congress that would introduce a risk-based supervisory system, including
changes in solvency requirements.



Fund management industry. Chile’s fund industry is led by the rapidly expanding mutual
fund sector, which is large relative to other emerging markets. Its assets (14 percent of GDP)
are primarily in fixed income securities, and about half in money market funds (fixed income
with maturity of 90 days or less). The 2013 law Ley Unica de Fondos which became effective
on May 1, 2014, puts the industry under a unified legal framework, modernizes the
regulatory framework, and improves investor protection by enhancing the supervisory
powers of the SVS and setting qualification requirements for fund managers.



Pension funds. Chile’s privately-administered pension system is large by international
standards. The government has appointed a commission to propose parametric changes to
ensure adequate replacement rates in the face of declining investment returns and rising life
expectancy. The government also plans to create a publicly-managed pension fund to
complement the six privately-managed funds. In response to concern from the mission on

10

14

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

CHILE

how this might affect the industry, the authorities stressed that the new fund manager
would operate under the same legal and regulatory framework as the others and that it
would focus on enrolling workers not currently picked up by private funds (e.g. selfemployed, rural).
25.
Multiple agencies provide close and active financial oversight but the framework and
governance could be strengthened. The financial industry is regulated by the Central Bank, and
supervised by SBIF, SVS, and the Superintendence of Pensions. The Financial Stability Council,
chaired by the Minister of Finance, facilitates coordination and data sharing. Two laws currently in
Congress, which will provide a legal framework to the Financial Stability Council and strengthen the
operational independence of SVS, should be implemented promptly once approved. But it will also
be important to strengthen the independence of the banking supervisor (SBIF).
26.
Conglomerates pose a challenge for supervision and a consolidated approach would
be more effective. Most financial institutions in Chile are part of conglomerates, which tend to be
large, complex, and prone to regulatory arbitrage and intra-group contagion. Chile’s financial
oversight structure relies on a silo approach, based on sectoral supervision and built-in firewalls
(such as related-party exposure limits). The authorities have strengthened oversight of
conglomerates within the current legal framework, including by advancing risk identification based
on case studies, tightening related-party exposure limits for banks, and improving the coordination
and information exchange mechanisms among supervisors. When approved, the Financial Stability
Council law will remove data sharing constraints among supervisory bodies that have hampered
effective supervision. While these advances are important, a more comprehensive approach (as
suggested by the 2011 FSAP) would be more effective. This would require a clear allocation of
powers and responsibilities for continuous consolidated supervision, prudential regulation at
conglomerate level, and corrective actions to address compliance with the framework.
27.
Implementation of other initiatives would strengthen financial resilience further. The
mission encouraged prompt congressional approval of legislation expanding the credit registry with
comprehensive credit history from banks and nonbanks. Furthermore, the revision of the General
Banking Law mentioned in last year’s staff report remains unfinished, and the mission recommended
that the authorities give it a new push, focusing on incorporating Basel III capital standards,
improving the legal framework for bank resolution, and strengthening the SBIF’s independence.
28.
The authorities explained that they are committed to push ahead with financial sector
reforms. They are committed to ensuring prompt approval of the legislative initiatives already in
Congress. They are also committed to pushing forward with other financial sector reforms, including
revising the General Banking Law to complete the adoption of Basel bank capital standards,
strengthen SBIF’s independence, and modernize the banking resolution, though the timing of these
reforms would require careful consideration given the broader policy agenda. In the shorter run, the
Central Bank has already put in consultation the new proposed regulation for the sound
management of banks’ liquidity risk.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

15

CHILE

D. Enhancing the fiscal framework
29.
There is scope to refine Chile’s fiscal framework. Chile has a well-earned track record of
prudent fiscal policy, formalized, since 2001, in a fiscal rule that has become a model for other
countries. The rule was strengthened with the creation in 2013 (by ministerial decree) of a Fiscal
Council to oversee its implementation. Though there is no urgent need for changes to the
framework, the mission suggested consideration of some modifications.


The rule/target. The rule is simple and understood by the public and markets, and has
shielded the budget from the business cycle and changes in copper prices, while allowing
for a flexible response when warranted. The structural target is set by each administration for
its four-year term and can be changed mid-stream. To provide more predictability and a
stronger anchor for fiscal policy, especially after deviations, clearer guidance on mediumterm objectives (e.g., structural balance or net assets) could be embedded in the rule itself.
When the rule was created the authorities set a structural surplus target of 1 percent of GDP.
While circumstances are now different (e.g., the government net asset position) and this
target may not be appropriate, a small structural surplus for “steady state” would help
preserve the government net asset position. Further, an explicit escape clause to allow
discretionary policy in the event of large, clearly defined shocks would enhance clarity while
preserving flexibility.



The Council. A law now in Congress will give the Council a stronger legal basis and will
hopefully be approved soon. The authorities could also consider strengthening the Council’s
autonomy and broadening its mandate (e.g., to include assessing outturns against targets).

30.
The authorities appreciated the recommendations but did not see, given the already
heavy agenda, revisions to the fiscal framework or the Council’s mandate as immediate
priorities. They also noted that the appropriate medium-run fiscal target is a topic that will need
further consideration and public discussion.

STAFF APPRAISAL
31.
Chile is confronting a challenging macroeconomic environment. Activity has slowed
markedly, mostly reflecting an adjustment toward trend after a period of rapid growth. There are
signs of a budding recovery but it is subject to considerable uncertainty and risk. And looking ahead,
Chile’s growth prospects are affected by waning, even reversing, tailwinds to growth as global
monetary policy begins to normalize and the copper price boom peters out. Chile also faces the
headwind of a slowing working-age population.
32.
Strengthening the prospects for strong and inclusive growth will require structural
reforms. Chile is ahead of the curve in terms of building strong and credible policy institutions,
flexible markets, and achieving macroeconomic stability. There is no single bottleneck to growth
that stands out. Rather a comprehensive reform effort will be needed to rekindle productivity, spur
investment, and boost human capital.

16

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

CHILE

33.
The government’s reform focuses on the right areas. The tax reform stands to achieve a
welcome reduction in regressivity, close loopholes, and raise permanent revenue to fund education
reform and additional health spending, and raise public savings. While the tax reform would likely
dampen investment and, in particular, corporate savings, other key elements of the reform agenda
could boost medium and long-run growth prospects. In particular, a well-designed education
reform that focuses on improving access and quality at all levels of schooling, especially at younger
ages, would be a win-win for growth and equity. Likewise with reforms that boost female labor force
participation. Labor market reforms should make sure the market remains flexible to support a
dynamic economy and the needed adjustments, while fostering equity. Reforms to upgrade key
infrastructure and spur innovation would help boost productivity growth and investment. Greater
clarity on details, timetables, and priorities—followed by rigorous implementation—will be critical to
reduce uncertainty and risk of delays.
34.
The current macroeconomic policy mix is broadly appropriate. The freely floating
exchange rate is acting as a shock absorber, facilitating adjustment, and supporting the recovery.
Monetary policy can remain accommodative so long as inflation expectations remain anchored.
Fiscal policy should remain broadly neutral and with full operation of automatic stabilizers. The
authorities’ commitment to achieve a balanced structural fiscal position by 2018 is appropriate—and
the path should calibrated to avoid excessive drag that could scupper the recovery—and the
resulting increase in public savings is welcome.
35.
Enhancing the fiscal framework would help preserve fiscal space. Providing clearer
guidance on medium-term fiscal objectives in the framework itself would provide a stronger anchor
for fiscal policy, especially after deviations. A small structural surplus target over the cycle would
help preserve strong fiscal buffers. An escape clause for discretionary policy in the event of shocks
could enhance clarity further while preserving flexibility. The authorities’ plan to put the Fiscal
Council on a more solid legal basis is an important step, but strengthened autonomy and a broader
mandate would improve its effectiveness.
36.
Chile should build on the progress achieved in recent years in enhancing financial
oversight. Chile has made significant progress, building on the 2011 FSAP, but important parts of
the agenda remain unfinished. It will be important to complete the initiatives now in Congress
relating to risk-based insurance supervision, a comprehensive credit registry, stronger governance
and independence of the Securities and Insurance Supervisor, and a new legal framework to the
Financial Stability Council. It will also be important to follow up with reforms to align capital
standards with Basel III, and provide greater independence to the Supervisor of Banks and Financial
Institutions. As the economy is adjusting, corporate sector financial health and leverage, as well as
the developments in the still dynamic real-estate sector should be monitored closely. Finally, given
their dominant role in the financial system, the ongoing strengthening of supervision of financial
conglomerates is important and welcome. Building on the progress achieved, consideration should
be given to a more consolidated approach to oversight of conglomerates.
37.
Staff proposes to hold the next Article IV consultation on the standard 12-month
cycle.

growth in the second half of 2013 will have a negligible effect on Chile’s growth in 2014, but a more
substantial effect by end-2015 (all else equal). The increases in the effective U.S. federal funds rate,

modest moderation on Chile’s growth by end 2014 and 2015.

Box 2. Tax Reform 1/
The authorities’ tax reform proposal has three main objectives: (i) to raise 3 percent of GDP in
revenue to finance an increase in spending on education (1.5 percent of GDP) and other social
program (0.5 percent), and close the structural fiscal deficit (1 percent); (ii) to make the tax system
more progressive; and (iii) to streamline savings and investment incentives and reduce tax
avoidance and evasion. The reform will be implemented over four years.

tax planning and evasion (activities that primarily benefit the well-off).



Raise the flat corporate income tax rate from 20 to 25 percent and lower the top marginal
personal income tax from 40 to 35 percent.



Introduce measures to foster investment for small and medium-size enterprises. Measures
include instant depreciation of investment (large companies would be eligible for
12 months); establishing a unique simplified tax regime with greater coverage; and
increased tax credit for fixed-asset purchases.



Modify real-estate related taxes and strengthen some excise and green taxes. VAT will be
charged on the sale of new houses; the existing VAT credit to builders of small houses will
be reduced; and capital gains from house sales will be taxed (except from seller-occupied
houses). The financial transaction (stamp) tax will also be increased. As for green taxes, the
reform includes an import tax on highly-polluting diesel vehicles and an emission-based
tax for industrial activity.



Strengthen the administrative capacity of the revenue authority by revamping
international tax norms and auditing practices, improving access to information, and
strengthening equipment and staffing.

Box 3. Electricity Sector in Chile
Chile imports about three-quarters of its energy
needs, including for electricity generation. The Central
(SIC) and Northern (SING) Interconnected Systems
represent 75 and 24 percent of installed generation
capacity. SIC is mostly hydropower and serves the central
part of the country with over 90 percent of the
population. SING is mostly thermal power, based on coal,
natural gas and oil, and it serves the northern parts where
the mining industry is located. Though demand for
electricity has been rising steadily, several generation
projects have been delayed due to environmental and
administrative reasons.

Macroeconomic policies, and financial and structural reform priorities of the authorities have been broadly in line with the Fund advice in recent years.

Fiscal Policy: Withdrawal of the fiscal stimulus injected in 2009 and

The authorities gradually withdrew the fiscal stimulus injected in 2009 between 2011 and

continuing gradual fiscal consolidation with the aim of a positive

2012, and adopted a tighter fiscal stance than implied by the 2013 budget. Their medium

structural deficit target of 1 percent of GDP.

Monetary Policy: Normalization of easy monetary policy stance

The central bank accelerated the pace of policy normalization in early 2011 to help bring

following the global financial crisis to avoid inflationary pressures, and

inflation expectations closer to the target, and maintained a neutral stance in 2012. Amidst

maintaining a neutral stance to support an orderly deceleration in

Structural Reforms:

The government launched several initiatives in recent years aimed at boosting productivity

i) Establishing a reform agenda for boosting productivity growth

by improving the business environment, such as by reducing the cost of doing business,
increasing competition (facilitating entry of new firms), making credit more accessible to

ii) Improving labor market efficiency and flexibility, including by

labor participation, and improving the efficiency of training programs
Recent reforms to improve (female) labor force participation -and in turn equity- include
extending the length of maternity leave, employment subsidies for low income women
and youth, and employment support and training services, albeit not used up extensively.
iv) Improving income distribution and access to quality education

Authorities had difficulty in achieving consensus on other measures to increase labor
market flexibility and efficiency, which is also true for enhancing generation and
transmission of electricity. On the other hand, the authorities established an education
quality assurance system, improved access to scholarships and state-guaranteed loans
with lower interest rates, and strengthened (conditional) cash transfer programs recently.

Annex II. A Closer Look at Investment11
The global copper boom has triggered a gradual transformation of investment in Chile.
Investment has become less focused on construction and much more on mining. Conventional
(non-mining) construction traditionally represented well above 50 percent of total gross fixed capital
formation (GFCF), but its importance has diminished in recent years due both to the growth in
mining investment (construction and equipment) and to the increasing accumulation of equipment
in other rapidly growing sectors, such as retail and services. Mining has increased its share in GFCF
from 15 percent in the early 2000s to 26 percent in 2012, and the increase has been particularly
pronounced since 2008. As a share of GDP, mining investment increased from 2.5 percent on
average in 1976–2007 to 4.7 percent in 2008–2012.12

determinant of copper prices and Chile’s growth outlook (mining represents more than 13 percent
of Chile’s GDP and more than 50 percent of Chile’s exports).
Investment growth collapsed in 2013. The decline was particularly sharp in the fourth quarter
when private GFCF dropped by 12 percent y/y (11.4 percent q/q s.a.), amidst a pronounced global
decline in copper prices. Quartely national accounts data on mining investment are not available,
and a precise assessment of the behavior of mining investment is difficult to establish. Nonetheless,
information from the Chilean Corporation of Capital Goods (CBC)—which compiles data about
planned investment projects—suggests a double digit decline in mining projects both q/q and y/y
at end-2013. The downward dynamics of Chile’s GFCF in 2013 also appeared broadly similar to that
of other commodity-exporting countries, but significantly more pronounced in the fourth quarter.
The more precipitous decline was largely due to one-off base effects in transportation equipment in
2012 and changes in the statistical treatment of inventories (and GFCF). Construction also tapered
off, with the completion of the post-2010 earthquake reconstruction, and had a modest additional
adverse effect on private GFCF. Nonetheless, even after accounting for the one-off base effect and
construction moderation, an additional unexplained idiosyncratic domestic effect remains. Many in
the business community point to uncertainty arising from new government’s reform agenda, in
particular the tax reform, though this is difficult to evaluate empirically.
The investment slowdown in Chile in late 2013 was
bigger than in other copper-exporting countries

First, alternative models and specifications are
not able to eliminate the large residuals in
2012Q3 and 2013Q4. For example, a projection
using a structural vector autoregression (VAR)
model shows significant errors in those
quarters.14

Dependent variable: quarterly growth of seasonally adjusted private GFCF; Explanatory variables: first lag in the
change of the exchange rate and real wages; second lag in the change of copper prices, interest rates, and expected
GDP growth rate. Due to the high correlation of the copper price change, the exchange rate depreciation, and Chile’s
growth expectations with China’s growth, the latter appears insignificant in the regressions and has been omitted.
Expected GDP growth rate refers to 1-year forecasts. Regression with robust standard errors, 41 quarterly

observations in 2003-13, and R =0.62. Alternative specifications using real effective exchange rate changes and
terms-of-trade growth yield significant coefficients, but a poorer fit.

The VAR model used in this analysis is described in Chapter 4 of the April 2014 World Economic Outlook (WEO). As
in the WEO, to avoid “overfitting” due to the small number of observations and large number of variables, the model
is estimated using Litterman’s (1986) Bayesian approach. The terms of trade variable in the WEO model is replaced
with growth in the copper price, while the real exchange rate is replaced with the change in the nominal CLP/USD
exchange rate. Real wage growth is also added to the model.



Second, as mentioned above, the copper price, the exchange rate—and the growth outlook
in Chile—are very highly correlated and their movement is likely to be jointly affected by an
external factor, such as China’s demand for copper. The VAR model suggests that a
1-percentage point increase in China’s growth leads to an increase in the copper price and
appreciation of the Chilean peso by about 3.5 percentage points in 8 quarters and to a
4-percentage point increase in GFCF growth over the same horizon.15
One percentage point increase in China's growth affects the copper price, the exchange
rate, and Chile's real GFCF growth

Third, some short-term effects appear counterintuitive. China’s growth seems to have a
negative impact on Chile’s investment growth in the short-run. As Fornero and Kirchner
(2014) explain, investment reaction to commodity price shocks could be sluggish since
economic agents initially perceive the price change as transitory. As agents observe
persistence in the copper price change, they revise their beliefs, and investment growth
starts following the direction of the commodity price change (i.e., the direction of China’s
growth). Alternatively, one might also need to specify different and more closely
representative proxies for China’s demand for copper—e.g., growth in China’s energy
investment instead of China’s GDP growth. The negative effect of exchange rate
depreciation on investment is another example of a counterintuitive result. In the short run
the depreciation does make imports of capital goods more costly; however, in the mediumterm, the depreciation helps regain competitiveness and is likely to encourage investment
growth.

With Chile’s mining investment boom coming to an end, copper prices on a downward trend,
and weakening growth expectations, the short-term GFCF growth outlook remains uncertain.
With an 8-percent depreciation of the peso—which weighs on the cost of imported capital goods—
and a slight drop in the copper price in 2014Q1, investment growth is likely to remain weak in the

Annex III. Recent Developments in Corporate Debt16
Corporate leverage has risen over the last two years, surpassing pre-crisis (2008) levels. 17
Currently at about 93 percent of GDP, corporate debt has increased by about 10 percentage points
since mid-2011 and is high compared to other emerging economies.
As a mitigating factor, FDI-related (external) debt accounts for most of this increase. FDIrelated debt, which is mostly in mining, likely has a lower rollover risk than other forms of financing
(e.g., bonds and bank loans) as it is between related parties.
In terms of stocks, local bank credit remains the most important source of debt, followed by
local bonds and foreign bank credit. About 50 percent of corporate debt is in the form of local
bank credit. Reliance on bank financing fell significantly in the aftermath of the global financial crisis,
but has since recovered to pre-crisis levels. Local bonds and foreign bank credit have declined in
significance and together now represent each about 13.5 percent. In the context of easy global
financial conditions, firms have also increased their issuance of external bonds to reach 6 percent of
total corporate debt. Despite this increase, corporate maturing external debt will remain at about
6.5–7.25 percent of GDP a year over the next three years, in line with the 2005–13 average.

The composition of debt varies across sectors. Community services (mainly health and education)
and the trade sector—the two sectors with the largest share of aggregate corporate debt—rely
relatively less on external debt (20 percent of total debt). Mining, on the other hand, relies heavily
on external debt, of which about half is in the form of FDI-related debt. Construction and agriculture
depend almost exclusively on domestic financing (in particular, bank financing).

Microeconomic data suggest that a handful of firms account for a significant part of the
expansion in corporate debt. The Capital IQ database includes data on 319 Chilean firms reporting
in 2008 and 2012. Their total debt amounted to roughly 60 percent of GDP in 2012 (or about
two-thirds of total corporate debt). The increase in the indebtedness of five firms (between 2008
and 2012) equaled six percentage points of GDP. For example, in 2012 LAN made a large acquisition
of TAM to become the LATAM Airlines Group. Cencosud (consumer retail), Codelco (mining), Antar
Chile (industrial conglomerate), and Empresas CMPC (materials-cellulose producer) also contributed
significantly.

In aggregate, corporate profitability, leverage, and liquidity indicators have worsened, but
there are important differences across sectors. In 2013, the food and transportation and
telecommunication sectors experienced a marked decline in profitability and liquidity, and an
increase in leverage. The construction sector has almost doubled its leverage from the 2002–08
average; its profitability is also lower but it has remained stable since 2009. The services sector has
the highest leverage but it also among the most profitable and liquid.

Still, other aggregate indicators of vulnerability do not point to acute risks. Currency
mismatches, as reported by the central bank, remain limited.18 Indicators for debt service capacity do
not show a uniform picture. The median of the net debt to EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes,
depreciation, and amortization) ratio, is quite high compared with other emerging market
economies, but has remained stable.19 A broader cross-country comparison of debt-to-equity ratios
shows that the number for Chile is roughly in line with its income level. In a comparison of the
interest coverage ratios (EBITDA divided by interest expenses) Chilean companies appear to have a
relatively good capacity to service debt. The IMF’s April 2014 Global Financial Stability Report (GFSR)
includes a stress testing exercise assuming a 25 percent increase in borrowing costs and a 25
percent decline in earnings that shows a low increase in Chilean debt-at-risk relative to other

Data to conduct a foreign currency stress testing exercise was not available to staff. However, to the extent that an
exchange rate shock (peso depreciation) would affect interest rate expenses and earnings, the stress test mentioned
below provides some indirect evidence that Chile is in a relatively good position to face such shock.
19

The figure is similar to Figure 1.20.3 in the IMF’s April 2014 GFSR. However, the GFSR computed the median only
for firms with positive net debt and positive EBITDA. The share of Chilean firms with negative net debt in the Capital
IQ database increased by 10 percent points from 2008 to 2012. In this Annex we compute the median for firms with
positive or negative net debt and positive EBITDA. The relative position of the medians for Chile is not significantly

Finally, corporate debt represents a large share of the Chilean financial system’s assets.
Commercial loans account for roughly 50 percent of banks’ portfolios. Domestic corporate bonds
account for 30 and 10 percent of life insurance companies’ and pensions funds’ investments,
respectively. The potential exposure of the financial sector to corporate sector vulnerabilities is
thus significant. However, central bank stress tests find the banking sector solvent even under
extreme scenarios. All banks maintain capital adequacy ratio above 8 percent in a test involving a
6 percentage point drop in output relative to baseline and subdued growth over the medium term;
a 300 basis points rise in interest rates and 100 basis points in the long term; and a 20 percent peso
depreciation.

construction and financial sectors and through a
drop in collateral values trigger a cycle of tighter
credit, lower economic activity, financial stress, and
real estate prices.

Recommended Policy Response
The floating exchange rate is the first-line of
defense. Foreign exchange intervention could help
avoid excessive currency volatility, if needed. As long
as inflation expectations remain well anchored over
the policy horizon, there is room for monetary
easing to support demand. In case of more severe
output drop, there would be ample room for a
robust fiscal response.
The floating exchange rate remains the first line of
defense. Foreign exchange intervention could help
avoid excessive currency volatility, if needed.
Nonetheless, the authorities should be prepared to
react as they did at the onset of the global financial
crisis and use measures to contain liquidity
pressures: expanded repo operations, broadening
the range of accepted collateral, and setting up
dollar swap auctions.

Potential Domestic Shocks

The priority should be to strengthen further the
financial oversight and regulation, including through
macroprudential policies, as needed, to help prevent
excessive exposure of the financial system. In the
event of a sharp correction in real estate prices, the
authorities should be ready to consider actions
(easing off macroprudential and/or monetary policy)
to dampen the possible vicious feedback loop
between real estate prices, credit, and activity.

The Risk Assessment Matrix (RAM) shows events that could materially alter the baseline path (the scenario most likely to materialize in the view of IMF staff). The
relative likelihood of risks listed is the staff’s subjective assessment of the risks surrounding the baseline (“low” is meant to indicate a probability below 10 percent,
“medium” a probability between 10 and 30 percent, and “high” a probability of 30 percent or more). The RAM reflects staff views on the source of risks and overall
level of concern as of the time of discussions with the authorities. Non-mutually exclusive risks may interact and materialize jointly

Figures in the boxes represent average projections for the respective variables in the baseline and scenario being
presented. Ten-year historical average for the variable is also shown.
2/ For historical scenarios, the historical averages are calculated over the ten-year period, and the information is
used to project debt dynamics five years ahead.
3/ Permanent 1/4 standard deviation shocks applied to real interest rate, growth rate, and current account
balance.
4/ One-time real depreciation of 30 percent occurs in 2015.

Source: Fund staff calculations.
1/ Public sector is defined as central government.
2/ Based on available data.
3/ EMBIG (bp).
4/ Defined as interest payments divided by debt stock (excluding guarantees) at the end of previous year.
5/ Derived as [r - π(1+g) - g + ae(1+r)]/(1+g+π+gπ) times previous period debt ratio, with r = effective nominal interest rate; π = growth rate of GDP deflator; g = real GDP growth rate;
a = share of foreign-currency denominated debt; and e = nominal exchange rate depreciation (measured by increase in local currency value of U.S. dollar).
6/ The real interest rate contribution is derived from the numerator in footnote 5 as r - π (1+g) and the real growth contribution as -g.
7/ The exchange rate contribution is derived from the numerator in footnote 5 as ae(1+r).
8/ Includes asset changes and interest revenues (if any). For projections, includes exchange rate changes during the projection period.
9/ Assumes that key variables (real GDP growth, real interest rate, and other identified debt-creating flows) remain at the level of the last projection year.

STATISTICAL ISSUES
(As of May 22, 2014)
Assessment of Data Adequacy for Surveillance
General: Data provision is adequate for surveillance. The National Institute of Statistics (INE)
regularly publishes a full range of economic and financial data. The Central Bank of Chile (CBC)
also publishes comprehensive macroeconomic and financial data. The Ministry of Finance
publishes fiscal data.
Key publicly accessible websites for macroeconomic data and analysis are:
National Institute of Statistics: http://www.ine.cl/
Central Bank of Chile: http://www.bcentral.cl/

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2014 Article IV Consultation with Chile

On June, 27, 2014, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded the
Article IV consultation1 with Chile.
Chile is confronting a challenging macroeconomic environment. After several years of strong
economic performance, Chile’s investment has weakened and growth slowed markedly due in
part to a weaker copper price outlook, with the economy performing slightly below potential. At
the same time, the depreciation of the peso has fed into higher inflation, but medium-term
expectations remain anchored around the Central Bank’s target. The current account deficit has
narrowed rapidly to 3.1 percent of GDP in the first quarter of 2014, but gross external financing
needs, though smaller than in 2013, remain high at 17 percent of GDP. The labor market—albeit
still tight—has softened.
Monetary policy has eased; fiscal policy has stayed broadly neutral. The central bank reduced the
policy rate from 5 to 4 percent between October 2013 and April 2014 amid a weakening
economic outlook and inflation below target. The cuts have been transmitted to interbank and
lending rates and contributed to peso depreciation. Nonetheless, credit growth has moderated for
all types of credit, except for mortgage credit, which remains brisk. The 2013 structural deficit
was 0.8 percent of GDP (staff estimate). The fall in copper revenue shifted the headline balance
to a deficit of 0.6 percent of GDP from a surplus of equal size in 2012. However, central
government net assets remained at 6.7 percent of GDP.
Growth is expected to bottom out in 2014 and gradually return to trend. Growth will reach 3.2
percent in 2014 and recover to its potential level by 2016, supported by monetary easing, the
peso depreciation, and recovery in the global economy. Key risks to the outlook stem from the
potential of further declines in copper prices and global financial volatility. Although there are
signs that investment is stabilizing and could pick up later in the year, consumption of durable

goods has declined and further weakening cannot be ruled out. Net exports should continue to
provide a boost to the recovery.
The government has launched an ambitious policy agenda to bolster long-term growth and
reduce inequality. It includes important reforms in taxation, education, productivity, and energy.
The authorities’ tax reform aims to create a more progressive tax structure and raise 3 percent of
GDP in revenue to fund greater spending on education and health, while raising public savings.
The education reform focuses on early childhood education, and fostering equal access and
improving quality and accountability in education. The energy agenda aims to promote
investment and efficiency and facilitate the use of clean technologies. The authorities’ plans to
bolster competitiveness include improving infrastructure, promoting research and development
and job training, and providing new services for small and medium-enterprises.
The financial sector is large, but risks are contained. Financial system assets exceed 200 percent
of GDP. Bank capitalization appears adequate, profitability remains comfortable, and
nonperforming loans are low and fully provisioned. Life insurers’ growing exposure to
commercial real estate merits watching, but stress tests do not show significant concerns.
Investment returns of the private pension system have declined, and the government has
appointed a commission to propose parametric changes to ensure adequate replacement rates.
The authorities have sent to congress legislation that establishes risk-based insurance supervision
and a comprehensive credit registry, and strengthens the legal framework of the Securities and
Insurance Supervisor and the Financial Stability Council.
Executive Board Assessment2
Executive Directors commended the authorities for their sound macroeconomic management,
which has contributed to Chile’s robust economic performance in recent years. At the same time,
Directors noted that the end of the copper price boom and the normalization of global monetary
conditions pose challenges to the growth outlook. They acknowledged, however, that Chile, with
its strong fundamentals and policy frameworks, including a floating exchange rate, is well placed
to cope with these challenges.
Directors agreed that the current macroeconomic policy mix is broadly appropriate. They
concurred that, with inflation expectations well anchored and some remaining slack in the
economy, monetary policy can remain accommodative although continued vigilance is needed in
light of recent inflation developments. Directors supported a broadly neutral stance of fiscal
policy, with full operation of automatic stabilizers. They welcomed the authorities’ commitment
to move toward a balanced structural fiscal position by 2018 while minimizing the drag on the
recovery.

At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the Board, summarizes the views of
Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the country's authorities. An explanation of any qualifiers
used in summings up can be found here: http://www.imf.org/external/np/sec/misc/qualifiers.htm.

3

Directors emphasized the need for structural reforms to strengthen prospects for strong and
inclusive growth. They agreed with the authorities’ focus on improving education, fostering
female labor force participation, upgrading key infrastructure, and promoting energy efficiency.
Directors also supported the tax reform’s objectives of increasing progressivity and generating
permanent revenue to finance additional social spending, while maintaining incentives for
private investment.
Directors commended the authorities for their track record of fiscal prudence, anchored in a
credible fiscal rule. They welcomed the plan to strengthen the legal framework for the Fiscal
Council, noting that consideration could be given in the medium term to increase its autonomy
and broaden its mandate. In due course, further refinements to the rule-based fiscal framework
could also be considered. Directors saw the benefits of setting a small structural surplus target
over the cycle in preserving adequate buffers.
Directors recognized the progress in enhancing financial sector oversight and the resilience of
the financial system, and looked forward to full implementation of the recommendations from
the Financial Sector Assessment Program. They underscored the importance of focusing efforts
on completing legislative initiatives, aligning capital standards with Basel III, and strengthening
the independence of the Supervisor of Banks and Financial Institutions. The dominant role of
financial conglomerates in the financial system also calls for a more consolidated approach to
their oversight. Directors encouraged close monitoring of corporate leverage, the real estate
sector, and the growing exposure of insurance companies to commercial real estate.

Statement by Alvaro Rojas-Olmedo, Executive Director for Chile
And Yan Carrière-Swallow, Advisor
June 24, 2014
On behalf of our Chilean authorities, we would like to thank the staff for the Staff Report and
Selected Issues papers on the occasion of the 2014 Article IV Consultation. As a small, open,
and financially integrated economy, the Chilean authorities appreciate the importance of
contributing to and benefiting from a healthy global economy. The constructive discussions
and thoughtful analysis conducted during the consultation process reflect the tradition of
candid dialogue between the authorities and Fund staff.
Chile’s solid macroeconomic policy framework is based on three long-standing pillars: a
structural fiscal rule that takes into account the long-term price of copper and the business
cycle; price stability under an inflation targeting framework implemented by an independent
central bank; and a financial system that is well capitalized and adequately regulated. These
pillars have been instrumental in securing Chile’s long-term macroeconomic stability, and
there is a broad consensus across the political spectrum and civil society on the importance of
such policy framework.
Background
After a period of strong growth above trend, the economy has been decelerating since early
2013, and the Central Bank of Chile has recently revised downwards its forecast for output
growth in 2014, from a range between 3.0 and 4.0 percent to a range between 2.5 and 3.5
percent. The deceleration has been somewhat more pronounced than initially expected, and
reflects a cyclical slowdown in investment along with the easing of private consumption in
recent months. As the copper boom recedes, the dynamism of investment in the mining
sector has eased accordingly and a negative output gap has opened. While unemployment
remains low by historical standards, a number of indicators are beginning to show signs of
slack in the labor market. Going forward, growth is expected to recover gradually starting in
the second half of 2014 as a result of the adjustment of key variables such as the real
exchange rate and long-term interest rates, as well as the policy responses being implemented
by the central bank and the operation of automatic stabilizers on the fiscal side. The main risk
to this outlook stems from China’s rate of growth and its implications for global metal prices.
After a long period of exceptionally favorable external conditions, financing conditions and
the terms of trade are normalizing and are expected to return to their longer-term averages.
Overall external demand from trading partners has remained stable, although its composition
is shifting as the gradual recovery in advanced economies continues, and emerging market
economies have decelerated significantly. Adjustment to these changing external conditions
has come primarily through the nominal exchange rate, which has depreciated approximately
20 percent since May 2013. Such depreciation of the Chilean peso has allowed for the

2
necessary adjustment in relative prices to increase the competitiveness of the tradable sector,
leading to strong export performance and a steady reduction of the current account deficit,
which is now expected to shrink to 2.5 percent of GDP in 2014. Such reduction in the current
account deficit reflects the adjustment process towards improving the external balance
position, thus reducing external vulnerability. The authorities coincide with the staff
assessment that the real exchange rate remains in line with its long-run fundamentals, and
agree that the risks from external imbalances have diminished substantially. The authorities’
estimation of potential growth is slightly higher than the staff’s, but they agree on the
importance of productivity-enhancing reforms to boost long-term growth.
Monetary policy
The Central Bank of Chile sets its monetary policy based on a long-standing inflationtargeting framework within a flexible exchange rate regime. These policies have ensured that
price stability is delivered by meeting the inflation target, while affording monetary policy
the flexibility to respond to economic fluctuations. In light of the cyclical deceleration in
growth in 2013 which extended to the first half of 2014, the Central Bank of Chile has cut the
monetary policy rate 4 times since October 2013 with a cumulative cut of 100 basis points
from 5 percent to 4percent. The monetary policy rate has been kept at 4 percent since March
of 2014, which represents an expansionary monetary policy stance to provide a stimulus to
domestic demand given the deceleration in growth and its implications for the inflationary
forecasts.
As mentioned before, the nominal exchange rate has played the role of shock absorber while
monetary policy has been able to focus on stabilizing domestic demand. The depreciation of
the peso has passed through to domestic price inflation, with year on year inflation reaching
4.7 percent in May, above the upper limit of the target band. The authorities expect this passthrough to be transitory and for inflation to converge to the 3 percent target within the twoyear policy horizon. This view is reaffirmed by private inflation expectations, which have
remained firmly anchored in the 3 percent target.
Going forward, monetary authorities will evaluate further monetary easing should domestic
and external conditions imply a deviation from the objective of maintaining price stability.
While the cyclical downturn is expected to reduce inflationary pressures, they are aware that
monetary conditions are already supportive and that recent price dynamics have been higher
than expected. They will proceed with caution and weigh the risks involved in order to fulfill
their mandate of price stability.
Fiscal policy
A new administration took office in March 2014, and they will continue to implement
prudent fiscal policy in line with the structural fiscal rule. Following a decisive fiscal

3
expansion in response to the 2009 financial crisis, the stimulus has been gradually withdrawn
in recent years. The structural budget balance for FY 2013 was -0.7 percent. The budget law
considers a structural deficit of -1 percent in FY 2014, and the new government has
announced its intention to eliminate it gradually in order to reach structural balance by the
end of their term in 2018. This announcement is in line with the Fiscal Responsibility Act of
2006, which requires incoming governments to announce structural fiscal targets for the full
length of their mandate within the first 90 days of their administration. Such announcements
provide a clear anchor for fiscal policy over the medium-term.
The Chilean government remains a net creditor, with assets in the sovereign wealth funds
having been built back up to pre-crisis levels. The authorities note the staff’s warning that
maintaining structural balance would erode these buffers as a share of GDP, and the
recommendation of adopting a small structural surplus in order to preserve them. The
authorities see these buffers as an important asset that allows favorable access to debt
markets and to respond to large external shocks. However, they point out that carrying large
buffers also imposes substantial opportunity costs in terms of forgone social investment.
Defining the appropriate target level for the structural balance requires a careful cost-benefit
analysis of this trade-off, and the authorities are open to further discussions on this topic.
The authorities welcome the Fund’s recommendations to strengthen the institutionality of the
Fiscal Council. They see merit in the proposal, but do not see it as an immediate priority.
That being said, the institutionality of fiscal prudence and transparency in Chile has been
continually improved over the past decades.
Financial sector
Recent cuts to the monetary policy rate have been effectively transmitted to local financial
markets, combining with low risk premiums to generate historically low rates on public and
private fixed income instruments. These favorable financing conditions in bond markets have
not generated excessive growth in household credit, and the financial sector remains broadly
resilient. However, the combination of a cyclical economic slowdown and loose financing
conditions poses potential risks that the central bank and financial supervisors are watching
carefully.
The corporate sector has taken advantage of such favorable financing conditions to increase
their debt levels. While leverage ratios remain contained, increases have reduced the sector’s
resilience to large shocks. The real estate sector remains dynamic, but the vacancy rate in
commercial real estate has increased in recent quarters. Mortgage growth has remained
stable, and there has been a slight moderation in the share of mortgages with high LTV
ratios, as well as a slight tightening of credit conditions for this type of loans. The monetary
authorities are vigilant of the risks these developments may pose, and have dedicated
extensive analysis to each in their recent Financial Stability Reports. Over the past two years,

4
they have made recurrent calls warning market participants not to extrapolate recent price
dynamics in real estate markets, which have been effective in moderating some of the
incipient trends observed in the past.
The authorities welcome the staff’s support for the regulatory reforms that are currently
before Congress. The Financial Stability Council law will strengthen the institutionality of
this important body, and will give it broader powers to share information across supervisory
agencies. This will increase its ability to adequately supervise large conglomerates, whose
operations often span banking, insurance, pension fund administration, as well as commercial
undertakings.
Reform agenda
As presented in the Staff Report, Chile’s economy has performed exceptionally well for
several decades, with high average growth rates and declining macroeconomic volatility.
These gains have allowed the country to improve its income status, and achieve substantial
reductions in the poverty rate. However, the authorities agree that two important challenges
currently face the Chilean economy: boosting productivity growth and lowering excessive
inequality. Overcoming these challenges will require extensive structural reforms in order to
address the permanent challenge of enhancing growth prospects of the Chilean economy over
the medium term.
President Bachelet has identified the education system as being a key bottleneck to both
objectives, and has proposed an agenda of reforms to education, taxes, productivity and
energy aimed at delivering inclusive growth. As the staff points out, current public spending
on education is low by international standards, so fresh resources will be required to improve
access and quality. Future economic growth will provide a part of these resources, but in
keeping with the authorities’ commitment to fiscal prudence, all new permanent expenditures
will be matched by increases in structural revenues.
In order for the proposed education reform to be fully funded, a tax reform has been
proposed in order to raise structural revenue by 3 percent of GDP. Two-thirds of these
resources will be ear-marked for financing the education reform and other social spending,
with the remaining third being used to increase public savings by eliminating the current
structural deficit of 1 percent of GDP by 2018. This will complete the gradual withdrawal of
the stimulus that was initially deployed in response to the 2009 crisis.
The design of the tax reform has been tailored to raise this revenue while maintaining
adequate incentives for private investment and activity, while also making the tax system
more progressive. The existing tax system is regressive and places a proportionately large
burden on low-income households. With indirect taxes representing more than half of fiscal
revenue, the reform will focus on shifting the tax burden towards direct taxes by (i) raising

5
the corporate income tax and (ii) closing an existing benefit that allows firms to defer
payment of taxes on undistributed profits, which has been used extensively for tax evasion.
The top personal income tax bracket will also be lowered in order to reduce the gap between
the Personal Income Tax (PIT) and Corporate Income Tax (CIT) rates, and thus the incentive
to elude payment through the creation of shell companies. In view of the size of the changes
being proposed, they will be implemented gradually over the coming years.
The authorities agree that passing the legislation quickly is important in order to avoid
creating uncertainty, but point out that a reform of this size must be given sufficient time to
be debated within the legislative process. That being said, the main aspects of the proposal
have not changed since their initial presentation during the Presidential campaign almost one
year ago, and have already been approved by an ample majority in the lower house. As part
of the ongoing legislative process, the authorities will discuss additional measures intended
to increase corporate savings and investment, while maintaining the objectives and main
aspects of the reform.
Finally, we take the opportunity to welcome the Fund’s decision to co-host the upcoming
High-Level Conference on “Inclusiveness and Growth in Latin America” with the
Government of Chile in Santiago later this year within the events scheduled as part of the
Road to Lima 2015. This event will consider the longer-term challenges faced by Latin
American countries as they reach middle-income status. We see the Fund as being wellplaced to offer broad international experience that can help members achieve their
development goals.
