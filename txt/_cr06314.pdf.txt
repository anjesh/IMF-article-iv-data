EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
Background and outlook. Belarus continues to benefit from very favorable energy import
prices. Macroeconomic performance has been strong over the past few years, with real GDP
growth averaging 7½ percent and inflation falling to under 8 percent at end-2005. Hefty and
increasing terms of trade gains related to cheap imported prices of energy have substantially
contributed to these results, but are unlikely to continue. Belarus remains vulnerable to a
deterioration of the external environment and still faces challenging tasks in fostering the
transition to a market-based economy.
Policy discussions focused on the following key issues:
•

the sustainability of Belarus’s macroeconomic performance in adverse external
conditions;

•

how to ensure high and sustainable noninflationary growth while enhancing transition
reforms; and

•

the need for fundamental policy changes.

The authorities and staff agreed that macroeconomic performance had been strong while
acknowledging that external circumstances had been favorable. Common ground was found on
the need to implement some structural reforms to foster sustainable growth in the medium
term, including on the following objectives: reducing the share of GDP redistributed by the
budget and the tax burden, strengthening the financial system, facilitating the development of
small and medium-sized enterprises, moderating real wage growth, and attracting foreign
investors.
The authorities stressed their achievements in consolidating Belarus’s manufacturing base,
maintaining a strong social protection element and implementing a unique Belarusian
economic development model based on a pragmatic approach to the role of the state and the
private sector. They also felt that their reform agenda was sufficient to ensure strong growth
over the medium term, even in a less favorable external environment.
Staff, however, stressed that the unfavorable outlook underscored the need for
fundamental policy changes. Staff emphasized, in particular, the need for fiscal tightening in
anticipation of lower revenues as terms-of-trade gains cease growing or fall, and
recommended that the authorities reduce the economy’s dependence on fiscal and quasi-fiscal
subsidies. Key among the recommended structural reforms are (i) introducing hard budget
constraints, including through a significant cut in government subsidies; (ii) phasing out price
controls and recommended (directed) lending, (iii) eliminating economywide mandatory wage
targets; (iv) revising and limiting the “golden share” rule to a handful of strategic enterprises;
and (v) initiating transparent tenders to privatize selected enterprises other than natural
monopolies.

achieved with a dominant role of
government in economic activity, while
the private sector, subject to pervasive controls and government interference, contributed only
one fourth to GDP (EBRD Transition Report 2005).
2.
Favorable energy import prices have supported high growth, particularly in 2005
(Figure 1). A widening gap between world prices for Belarus’s energy-intensive exports and
prices of energy imports from Russia have provided a large and increasing amount of trading
gains—reaching about 12 percent of GDP in 2005.1 These gains were redistributed through
various channels (Box 1), boosting domestic demand—investment and household
consumption grew by 13½ and 14½ percent, respectively, in 2005. A measure of growth that
excludes the impact of favorable external conditions (Box 2), however, shows that underlying
performance has fallen short of headline growth since 2001, especially in 2005.
3.
Other factors also supported growth. Belarus benefited from strong partner country
growth, which, together with the 12¾ percent terms-of-trade improvement, helped swing the
current account into a surplus of 1.6 percent of GDP in 2005. Moreover, economic
stabilization and rising incomes have strengthened consumer confidence, further contributing
to increasing domestic demand. The economy’s positive momentum has carried forward into
2006, despite higher imports (Table 1).

1

In 2005, Belarus imported gas at US$47 per thousand cubic meters (a quarter of world market levels), and crude
oil at US$30/barrel (half of world market prices).

6
4.
Ample production capacity and price controls have contributed to declining
inflation, but some signs of inflationary pressures are emerging (Figure 2). Owing to a
sizable output gap, strong demand has boosted GDP growth beyond potential while headline
inflation declined steadily to 6.9 percent in May 2006, aided also by pervasive administrative
controls over price formation (Box 3). However, rising unit labor costs, tighter capacity
utilization in many sectors, a high and increasing ratio of producer price index (PPI) to CPI
inflation, and estimates of underlying inflation suggest a build-up in inflation pressures.
5.
Macroeconomic data may not tell the whole story. While the statistical system is
generally good, state controls and non-market mechanisms permeate economic activity,
substantially altering the information content of data. This complicates the assessment of
economic developments and of the impact of policy actions.

Box 1. Centralized Redistribution of Terms-of-Trade Gains
Belarus imports energy from Russia at prices below world market levels and exports refined oil
products (US$4.9 billion or 55 percent of non-CIS exports in 2005), as well as other energy intensive
products, at world market prices. The resulting gains are redistributed into the domestic economy
through the budget and through non-budgetary channels.
About a quarter of the terms-of trade gains accrues to the budget by taxing the consumption and
export of imported energy, as well as the profits of energy companies. This fiscal windfall feeds
budgetary transfers to state-owned enterprises and banks, and to the population (including hikes in
budgetary wages). It also supports high budgetary investment.
The remaining gains are redistributed through several non-budgetary channels. First, through
economywide mandated wage increases, which, while contributing to raising household demand,
further decapitalize enterprises that cannot cover these increases with profits. Second, through large
scale recommended (directed) bank lending funded by increasing deposits that reflect higher
enterprise profits (mainly those of exporters) and rising household income. Such lending occurs
mainly through state-owned banks, which have benefited from a 2005 decree requiring state
enterprises to place their deposits with these banks. Finally, the government also mandates significant
redistribution through selected state-owned enterprises, notably by keeping domestic energy prices
below full cost-recovery levels, and in the form of free gasoline to agriculture.

7

Box 2. Measures of Underlying Growth
Underlying growth is defined as actual growth minus transient growth effects. Three methods are
used to calculate transient effects in 2000–05.
The terms of trade approach relies on econometric estimates of the terms of trade elasticity of
growth. We combine staff estimates for Belarus with estimates in Broda’s (2001) VAR model for
developing countries (see Selected Issues Paper, Chapter I for details and references).
The trading gains approach assumes that the real income from terms of trade windfalls has been
consumed or invested since 2000. Following SNA (93), we calculate trading gains, the excess of real
Gross Domestic Income over real GDP, as

X −M ⎧ X
M⎫
−⎨
−
⎬,
P
⎩ PX PM ⎭
where X and M are export and import values, PX and PM the relevant price indices, and P the GDP
T=

deflator.
The energy consumption approach directly estimates underlying GDP growth, relating it to energy
consumption, following Rawski (2001). It assumes a constant energy efficiency of production—not
unrealistic since production technologies are unlikely to have changed substantially (over 70 percent
of machinery and equipment in Belarus has been fully depreciated in recent years). Input-output
tables also show a broadly stable cost share of energy in industrial production during 2001–04. Given
its macroeconomic importance, gas consumption is used to proxy underlying GDP.

Direct and indirect interventions in price formation
add up to pervasive price controls. Article 394 of
the Civil Code stipulates the free formation of
prices, but allows the president and state agencies
to control them administratively. Wholesale and
retail prices are regulated through fixed prices,
price caps, markup ceilings, rate of return ceilings,
and governmental indicative prices (World Bank’s
Doing Business in 2005 survey). They are also
subject to norms on manufacturers’ trade margins
and the Council of Ministers’ mandatory exfactory
price limits based on the projected inflation rate. If
a manufacturer’s envisaged price increase exceeds
this index, the manufacturer must seek approval
from a regional pricing authority—generally
forthcoming only if costs are assessed to be in line
with established norms.

Source: EBRD Transition Report 2005 .
Note: A rating of 1 indicates most prices formally controlled by
the government; 4.33 indicates standards of advanced countries:
complete price liberalization with no price control outside
housing, transport, and natural monopolies.

Of the World Bank survey’s 1,200 respondents,
88 percent had been inspected by the ministry of economy, local authorities, or other price control
agencies during 2004, and 39 percent by the State Control Committee. If a price regulation is
violated, the authorities seize excess earnings and impose a penalty. Repeat violations can lead to
business closure.

expected acceleration of spending by earmarked funds.

7.
There has been no change in the exchange rate policy pursued by the NBRB. De
jure, it targets the exchange rate of the Belarusian rubel to the Russian ruble within a
horizontal band (plus/minus 2 percent). De facto, the exchange rate of the Belarusian rubel
against the Russian ruble is allowed to move in line with market trends outside the established
band with a view to limiting daily fluctuations in the exchange rate of the Belarusian rubel visà-vis the U.S. dollar. Exchange rate stability vis-à-vis the U.S. dollar has helped anchor
inflation expectations, and facilitated further gradual dedollarization and a rapid increase in
international reserves in 2005.
8.
Monetary policy has been mildly accommodative (Figure 3). Rising government
deposits in the NBRB and some NBRB intervention largely sterilized the increase in
international reserves, and limited broad money growth to about 30 percent through
November, despite a reduction of 600 basis points in the refinance rate and of one percentage
point in the reserve requirement. The liquidity impact of the large drop in government
deposits at end-2005 was broadly neutralized in early 2006 by the subsequent partial

12
rebuilding of such deposits, and some NBRB interventions in the money markets and in the
foreign exchange market to support the currency ahead of the March elections. International
reserves remained broadly unchanged in January-June 2006. In June, the NBRB cut the
refinance rate by 50 basis points to 10½ percent and the reserve requirement by another
percentage point.

Bank recapitalizations have continued amid rapid credit growth (Figure 4). The

also increased, reaching about ½ percent of

below 2 percent at end-2005. A tenth of NPLs
remained unprovisioned in May 2006 (an
improvement from a year ago), and the few banks still not complying with prudential
requirements on liquidity and maximum risk exposure have agreed to an adjustment schedule
with the NBRB.
10.
Despite improvements, deep-seated external vulnerabilities remain (Figure 5).
First, while the current account was in surplus in 2005, the non-oil current account deficit is
large and growing as export volumes lag behind imports mainly reflecting declining export
market share in Russia, a key market.3 In this regard, Russia has indicated that Belarus’s
energy import costs may rise substantially from 2007. Second, real wage growth has
exceeded productivity gains over most of the last six years by a considerable margin, eroding
competitiveness. In particular, the appreciating bilateral real exchange rate vis-à-vis the U.S.
dollar and the euro in recent years does not bode well for non-CIS export prospects. Third,
gross foreign exchange reserves—while up by two-thirds in 2005—remain low at less than
one month of imports and one-third of short-term debt (which comprises 80 percent of
3

Import volumes spiked at end-2004, in the run up to the introduction of the destination principle for VAT in
trade with Russia, then fell substantially. Rival exporters heightened competition in the Russian market and some
bilateral trade disputes, suggesting that Belarusian exporters’ market share losses may not be temporary.

13
external debt). Fourth, foreign direct investment (FDI) is extremely low by international
comparison at 1 percent of GDP, and negligible from countries other than Russia. Should
shocks materialize, the ability of the highly concentrated economy to adjust flexibly remains
uncertain.4
11.
Structural reforms have not
fostered the role of the private sector. In
aiming to refine centralized macroeconomic
management, Belarus is further diverging
from the liberalization trend in other
transition economies. Complex and
changing administrative requirements, the
state’s overarching role in the concentrated
economy, an excessive golden share rule
(applicable ex post), and residence permit
requirements restricting the movement of
labor to large cities thwart private sector
investment and product and labor market
flexibility.

Belarus lags well behind other countries
in implementing structural reforms.

12.
Regarding the effectiveness of Fund surveillance, while significant differences
remain between the views of the authorities and staff on economic and structural
policies, Fund surveillance has contributed to narrowing some differences. The
authorities remain unconvinced about the need to revise their overall policy approach, but
indicated that Fund advice and technical assistance had contributed toward formulating some
of their policy and reform measures. Their track record in implementing technical assistance
(TA) recommendations has been good.

II. POLICY DISCUSSIONS
13.
Discussions focused on the sustainability of rapid growth and the attendant
policy implications. In staff’s view, recent growth critically benefited from fiscal and quasifiscal redistribution of terms-of-trade gains, which facilitated high mandatory wage increases
and strong investment growth while enterprise losses have remained high. Even if energy
import prices were to remain at current levels, further terms-of-trade gains are unlikely
unless world market energy prices continue to rise. In staff’s opinion, this suggests (i)
markedly lower future GDP growth, since the growth rate of subsidies, investment, and
mandatory wage increases experienced in recent years is no longer sustainable; and (ii) a
need for policy adjustment. Staff stressed that the possibility of significantly reduced
subsidies from Russia—increasingly likely as the horizon lengthens—imparts a significant
downside risk to the near-term outlook, further underscoring the need for early policy action.
Box 4 outlines a possible scenario, which could significantly worsen a medium-term debt
outlook that would otherwise appear benign (Figure 6, Tables 6–7). Against this background,
staff saw a compelling need for up-front fiscal tightening to mitigate the risk of having to
undertake significant pro-cyclical tightening as terms-of-trade gains cease or are reversed.
Inevitably, this would involve reductions in subsidies and transfers to loss-making
enterprises, making early liberalization of prices and wages, followed by broader structural
reforms, a priority.
14.
The authorities did not agree with the thrust of staff’s analysis. In their view, the
role of terms-of-trade gains was secondary, so there was no need for significantly altering
policies. They were not ready to discuss the risks to the outlook and the policy implications
pending the conclusion of talks with Russia on energy prices around end-2006. They argued
that in the common economic space, Belarus would continue to benefit from low domestic
Russian energy prices, thus avoiding a substantial deterioration in the external environment.
A. Short and Medium-Term Macroeconomic Outlook
15.
The authorities’ 2006–10 Socioeconomic Program targets high growth and low
inflation assuming a broadly unchanged external environment and economic
structure. The key sources of growth are to be rapidly rising government-led investment
and employment. Inflation is envisaged to fall to 5 percent by 2010, and current account
surpluses, as well as substantial FDI inflows, are envisaged throughout the period.

Box 4. The Impact of Surging Energy Prices—an Illustrative No Policy–Change Scenario
Belarus—like other CIS energy importers—is likely to face an increase in energy prices toward international levels over
the medium term. The baseline scenario is consistent with the authorities’ views. A risk scenario assesses the implications
of a faster increase in energy prices. Gas prices are assumed to double to $95 per thousand cubic meters in
2007—at par with the 2006 level negotiated for Ukraine and below that for Armenia—and then converge to international
prices by 2012. Oil prices are assumed to smoothly converge to international prices during 2007–12.
To quantify the impact of surging energy prices on baseline growth, five estimates are averaged. The production
function model (Bruno and Sachs, 1985) calculates the direct impact on output using the cost share of energy. The net
import model (IEA, 2004) assumes that higher energy prices reduce the wealth of net energy-importing countries.
Additional estimates of the impact on growth are obtained from panel regressions in Broda (2004), Becker and Mauro
(2006), and Chapter I of the Selected Issues Paper.
The first-round impact on inflation is simulated using (i) the CPI weights of energy and utilities prices; (ii) the passthrough rate of energy import prices to utilities prices (gradually increasing from 50 percent in 2007 to full pass-through
by 2011); and (iii) the gas intensity of heat and electricity production. Inflation may actually be higher despite slower
growth, owing to second-round effects—particularly if profits cannot act as a buffer.
Higher energy prices cause an equilibrium real exchange rate (ERER) depreciation, leaving the RER overvalued. The
ERER is approximated using the long-term relationship between a real exchange rate index and PPP GDP per capita,
estimated on a panel of 100 countries and on a subpanel of transition economies. The scenario uses the average ERER
elasticity from these two regressions. In the medium term, higher inflation vis-à-vis trade partners may generate further
RER overvaluation.
The fiscal balance gradually deteriorates to about 5 percent of GDP by 2011 because revenues fall as enterprise sector
profitability drops, and larger subsidies and transfers are needed owing to the incomplete pass-through of energy costs, and
the rising share of lossmakers. The current account deficit will rise to more than 10 percent of GDP over the medium
term as the energy shock unfolds, generating a run-up in external debt. Banking system capital adequacy would fall to
barely above the regulatory 8 percent level with increasing credit risk (assuming 5 percent of loans to agriculture and 10
percent to other sectors becoming loss, and 20 percent of standard loans becoming substandard). Excluding two large
banks, the system appears much more fragile and relatively more exposed to the non-agriculture sector.

16.
In staff’s view, economic growth is likely to slow down in the medium term in
the absence of structural reforms.
•

Growth in 2006 should remain robust. Reflecting continued strong growth in
Russia, preliminary GDP data for the first six months of 2006, and a sizeable
carryover, staff project growth, driven by domestic demand, at around the lower end
of the government’s projected range of 7–8½ percent.

•

But continued rapid noninflationary growth in 2007 and beyond is increasingly
doubtful under current policies. Terms-of-trade gains are likely to stop increasing,
constraining centralized redistribution. Expansionary macroeconomic policies to
boost growth above potential will also gradually cease to be a noninflationary policy
option as the output gap closes. Moreover, even massive public investment would not
necessarily raise productivity rapidly if resources are not allocated efficiently.5 Panel
regressions using a neoclassical growth model—calculated as background to the
discussions—suggest annual potential growth of about 3½-4 percent over the next
five years (Craft and Kaiser, 2004). Similar results obtain in a growth-accounting
framework, with total factor productivity (TFP) calculated as (i) the average
Belarusian TFP over recent years; or (ii) the average of transition economy TFP
estimates.6 TFP is unlikely to sustain high growth rates in the medium term given the
large share of fully depreciated productive equipment, and policies precluding large,
technology-enhancing FDI inflows. Finally, exports’ contribution to growth would
peter out as Belarusian exports encounter increasing competition.

17.
Staff expressed reservations about some aspects of the authorities’ mediumterm outlook. First, the projected current account surpluses, together with the sharp
increase in the share of investment in GDP stemming from the government’s ambitious
investment plan, would imply a considerable contraction in domestic consumption to create
room for the necessary sharp rise in savings from its current level of 31 percent of GDP. In
contrast, staff projects gradually deteriorating current account deficits after 2006, stemming
from weak export volume growth and stagnant terms of trade. Second, the envisaged
employment increases would require raising the share of employment in the working-age
population by 10 percentage points from an already high 71 percent in 2005, given the
demographic trends. Third, projecting substantial increases in FDI would appear overly

2006).

B. The Need for Structural Reforms
18.
Some common ground has emerged. The authorities envisaged gradual reforms as
part of their multiyear Socioeconomic program, notably some cuts in taxes and subsidies, and
measures to strengthen the financial system, facilitate small and medium-sized enterprise
development, moderate real wage growth, and attract foreign investors.
19.
Staff argued for deeper and less gradual reforms. A more rapid withdrawal of
state intervention (through the structural reforms described in Box 5) would complement
the authorities’ own intentions and aim at creating favorable conditions for private sector
growth while the economy was still in a period of strength. This would foster an efficient
allocation of resources, and ultimately boost productivity and potential growth.
20.
However, the authorities remained unconvinced about the need for, and
desirability of, more radical reforms than those envisaged in their Socioeconomic
Program. They pointed to past macroeconomic performance as proof that Belarus’s
development model was appropriate. The authorities strongly objected to phasing out
recommended lending and centrally mandated wage increases, and to wide-ranging
privatization, which they saw as putting their social objectives at risk.
C. Fiscal Policy and Reform
21.
Staff argued for fiscal tightening starting in 2006. The 2006 budget targets an
overall deficit of 1.5 percent of GDP, but a broad balance is within reach on current

22
policies.7 Staff suggested targeting a moderate surplus of about ½ percent of GDP through
expenditure restraint to create fiscal space for future tax cuts and to avoid having to endure
lower revenues—notably energy-related ones—while committed to stretched expenditure
levels. The authorities, while acknowledging in principle the case for some fiscal savings,
were not in a position to commit to a budget surplus this year.
22.
For 2007, the authorities target a fiscal deficit of 1½ percent of GDP. They were
not prepared to discuss the final parameters for the 2007 budget, but discounted the risk that
next year’s budget would suffer from lower terms-of-trade gains. Pointing to the need to
support growth and to the likely availability of financing given low public debt (8.5 percent
of GDP), they considered a moderate fiscal deficit appropriate. Staff argued that fiscal
policy should be more restrained in 2007 and beyond, stressing that revenues would reflect
stagnating terms-of-trade gains, and that expansionary fiscal policy would heighten
inflationary pressures and worsen competitiveness. In this context, the quality of
expenditure, rather than its quantity, and its ability to enhance productivity were key. Room
for maneuver would also be needed to offset contingent liabilities (notably related to
cumulative fiscal costs of recommended lending), to finance the cost of structural reforms
which may be frontloaded, and—if needed—for smoothing the impact of possible adverse
developments in energy prices.
23.
A range of fiscal reforms would need to begin already in 2006 to leave room for
future maneuver. The authorities stressed that tax cuts were continuing in 2006 and that
the president had declared that subsidies would be scaled back. While welcoming these
plans, staff recommended focusing on (i) identifying permanent expenditure cuts necessary
to offset looming revenue losses; (ii) reducing budget rigidities by phasing out earmarking;
and (iii) incorporating remaining extrabudgetary funds into the budget and the Treasury
Single Account, gradually moving all central budgetary funds to the latter, to enhance
expenditure management. Staff also argued for phasing out subsidies and transfers to lossmaking enterprises, and discontinuing bank recapitalizations associated with recommended
lending.

7

Under current projections, the state budget deficit would be ½ percent of GDP smaller than budgeted, while
the Social Protection Fund (SPF) would record a 1 percent of GDP surplus as in previous years (the budget
conservatively assumes that the SPF would be in balance).

23

Box 5. Structural Reform Agenda
To address the most binding constraints to sustained growth, structural reforms should primarily aim
at retrenching the state’s pervasive intervention in economic activity, hardening budget constraints,
and attracting FDI. While Belarus’s savings and investment levels are high and the human capital
endowment favorable, potential growth is constrained by the limited efficiency of state-led
investment and the low effective returns to private investment evidenced by its low share (both
domestic and foreign). Appropriate sequencing and pacing of reforms, together with supporting
macroeconomic policies are key to containing potential negative effects on economic activity.
The most urgent reforms would curtail direct government intervention in economic activity, notably
by
•

sharply reducing entry barriers for private firms and streamlining the regulatory framework;

•

phasing out controls on price formation to enhance price signals;

•

discarding centrally mandated wage targets to help wages clear the labor market and avoid
decapitalizing enterprises; and implementing rules in SOEs to keep wage growth in line with
productivity increases;

•

phasing out recommended lending to enhance market-based financial intermediation;

•

curbing the golden share rule to apply only to a handful of strategic enterprises so as to attract
8
domestic and foreign private investors;

•

adopting international accounting standards for enterprises.

This would be followed—after sufficient preparation, but without undue delay—by
•

transparently privatizing banks and nonmonopoly enterprises to ensure more efficient use of
factors of production;

•

curbing subsidies and enforcing the exit of inefficient enterprises to fortify enterprise budget
constraints; and

•

to complement the latter effect, gradually reducing the tax and regulatory burden financed by
cutting state support to enterprises.

Concurrent institutional reforms would round off the transition, including
•

putting in place effective regulation of economic monopolies;

•

strengthening the social safety net to minimize the social costs of efficient labor reallocation;

•

reforming tax administration, public expenditure management, and the pension and health
systems to ensure fiscal sustainability.

8

The golden share can be introduced ex post in any enterprise with current or past state ownership, wage arrears,
accounting or workers’ rights irregularities, allowing the government to take decisions regarding the enterprise’s
activity. From June 2006, it no longer applies to banks. The authorities claim that they use the golden share rule
very selectively.

Part of the revenue loss from this measure would be compensated by increasing the central government profit
tax rate from 24 to 26 percent and unifying local sales tax rates at a higher average level. The first of these
changes would reduce the number of taxes levied on the same tax base, as well as revenue earmarking.

25
gains from possible reform measures had commenced. Staff argued for a pension reform
that would raise the effective retirement age (which was falling further behind the nominal
retirement ages of 60 for males and 55 for females, owing to early retirements) and enhance
the link between lifetime contributions and pension benefits.
D. Monetary and Exchange Rate Policy
26.
The NBRB agreed that its monetary and exchange rate policy should primarily
aim at attaining the inflation—rather than exchange rate—objective. While the NBRB
currently sets targets for money supply (M1) and an explicit band for the Russian ruble
exchange rate (and an implicit one vis-à-vis the U.S. dollar), these targets can be revised
during the year if needed to achieve the inflation objective given developments in money
demand. Observing that some exchange rate flexibility would help buffer the economy
against real shocks, the NBRB agreed that it should move further toward clearly indicating
inflation as the primary monetary policy objective in its 2007 monetary policy guidelines. In
this context, while an intermediate target for money supply was needed, staff cautioned
against setting further quantitative targets—notably for nominal exchange rates—since this
could undermine the credibility of the NBRB’s commitment to the inflation objective.
27.
There was agreement that monetary policy needed to remain focused on its
target. Staff agreed that the NBRB’s commitment to lower inflation to 7-9 percent in 2006
and to 5 percent by 2010 was attainable. However, given the need to remain vigilant about
inflationary pressures, it found the latest reduction in the refinance rate and in reserve
requirements somewhat premature. These moves boosted liquidity in a context in which (i)
measured inflation might not fully reflect underlying inflationary pressures, and (ii) the
preference for foreign currency as a store of value remained high (40 percent of bank
deposits were foreign currency denominated). Staff urged the NBRB to discontinue largescale liquidity support to banks and lending to the economy in support of government
programs. Noting that interest rate caps distorted credit allocation and may be largely offset
by increased lending fees and commissions, staff advocated their elimination—an objective
the NBRB concurred with as a medium-term goal.
28.
The framework for monetary policy and operations has become more
transparent. The NBRB has improved communications to the public of its policy actions
and operations. Staff suggested that banks could be allowed to better benefit from reserve
requirements averaging to use available liquidity more efficiently. The NBRB could also
usefully shorten the maturity of NBRB securities used in liquidity withdrawal operations to
coincide with the period for which it could make reliable liquidity forecasts. The NBRB was
receptive to both suggestions.
29.
Coordination between the NBRB and government is key for building public
confidence in macroeconomic policies. Enhancing the NBRB’s operational independence
and further strengthening cooperation with the Ministry of Finance would be key steps

26
toward bolstering the operational framework of monetary policy. Staff also advocated (i)
replacing outstanding NBRB loans to the government with marketable securities that could
be used to conduct open market operations and (ii) moving government deposits into the
NBRB from banks to facilitate NBRB liquidity management—gradually, to avoid an
adverse impact on banking system liquidity.
E. Financial Sector Soundness
30.
The NBRB has improved the supervisory and regulatory framework. The
transparency of bank capital, corporate governance, and risk management has been
strengthened and the use of external audits increased. In a welcome recent step, the golden
share rule was eliminated for banks to encourage the entry of strategic foreign investors in
the banking system. Progress was also made toward adopting a new banking code, and laws
on credit bureaus, deposit insurance and mortgages. The authorities indicated that Fund
assistance had played a role in several of these accomplishments, and had also helped raise
NBRB staff’s technical skills. They agreed that continued vigilant oversight was key,
particularly of systemic banks that failed to comply with all prudential requirements.
31.
Banking sector soundness has improved but vulnerabilities remain, especially
in light of continued rapid credit growth. Low NPL levels, with a considerable share of
loans extended at the government’s behest, might not adequately reflect borrowers’
repayment capacity (for instance, NPLs exclude loans under central government guarantee).
Also, the level of loans written off in 2005 (about 0.35 percent of GDP), which have
reduced NPLs, suggested a need for improving banks’ risk assessment procedures. Staff
noted that high capital adequacy ratios in the banking sector reflected recurrent
recapitalizations, and, per se, did not provide an adequate forward-looking measure of the
system’s safety. In this regard, stress tests showed that banking system resilience to shocks
had improved since 2004 (when the FSSA stress tests were conducted), but underscored the
need for considerable capital injections in case of a severe shock when two large banks were
excluded from the test.
32.
Staff emphasized that recommended lending should be phased out as rapidly as
feasible. It argued that such—effectively directed—lending for housing, agriculture, and
other purposes increased banks’ vulnerabilities as appropriate risk management procedures
were not followed; it necessitated large recurrent bank recapitalizations; and it built up
potentially large contingent liabilities. Such lending also (i) generated maturity mismatches
as affected banks funded themselves at short maturities, increasing systemic liquidity risk;
(ii) distorted financial resource allocation; and (iii) precommitted the budget to bear an
interest cost during these loans’ long life span. The NBRB agreed that eliminating
recommended lending could be a medium-term objective.

27
F. The Trade Regime
33.
Although weighted average tariffs on imports from outside Russia are a
moderate 11 percent, the trade regime retains numerous ad-hoc administrative
restrictions. Importers must receive special government permits to import consumer goods
considered products of comparative advantage for Belarus. Mandatory shares of
domestically produced goods are prescribed for retail outlets, and state procurement favors
local firms. Staff argued that these attempts to support inefficient domestic production and
compensate for weak export performance hampered growth by (i) reducing competition, (ii)
raising domestic prices, and (iii) increasing the cost of producing export goods (to the extent
they affected imported inputs).
III. STAFF APPRAISAL
34.
Belarus has enjoyed several years of high growth and falling inflation. Growth
reflected rising labor productivity aided by increasing capacity utilization, with demand
benefiting from unfettered access to Russia’s expanding market and the redistribution of
escalating terms-of-trade gains. The successful exchange rate anchor, administrative
intervention in price formation, and a sizable output gap have contributed to lower inflation.
35.
However, once the energy windfall ceases to rise, the Belarusian development
model will come under strain. Continued centralized support to domestic activity will
rapidly raise inflationary pressures, given the vanishing output gap. Without policy
adjustment and structural reforms—notably liberalizing prices and wages, and curbing the
state’s role in economic activity—growth will revert toward its lower potential level. The
prospect of significantly higher prices of energy imported from Russia imparts considerable
further downside risks to the outlook, since the attendant compression of terms-of-trade
gains would seriously worsen the external current account and force significant cuts in fiscal
subsidies and other forms of demand-supporting redistribution.
36. Fiscal policy should be tightened, starting in 2006, in anticipation of revenue
losses and structural reform costs. To this end, expenditures—especially recurrent ones—
should be constrained to the extent feasible in 2006, and further reduced as a share of GDP
in 2007 and beyond. Spending cuts should be focused on subsidies (including to banks), net
lending, and transfers to lossmaking enterprises. Remaining elements of earmarking should
also be eliminated.
37. Institutional reforms to enhance fiscal management and sustainability are also
needed. In coordination with the NBRB, central government deposits should be moved
gradually to the NBRB, and outstanding NBRB loans to the government converted into
marketable securities to enhance liquidity management. Moreover, pension reforms
sufficient to address the looming demographic changes should be developed expeditiously.

28
38. The NBRB should refocus monetary policy on inflation control. In this regard,
staff noted that the NBRB should stand ready to accept more flexibility in the exchange rate
in the event of inconsistency between the inflation and exchange rate targets. Moreover, to
enable the NBRB to pursue monetary policy effectively, its operational independence needs
to be strengthened, the number of its quantitative targets pruned, its direct lending to the
economy discontinued, and interest rate caps eliminated.
39. Progress in strengthening the supervisory framework and banking system
soundness needs to continue. The NBRB should ensure that future liabilities stemming
from remaining directed lending are fully reflected in prudential indicators. By vigilantly
enforcing all prudential requirements, it can lower the risk that continued rapid credit
growth gives rise to higher NPL levels. Staff welcomes the recent steps toward attracting
strategic foreign investors to the banking system, and stresses the importance of ensuring
transparency and competition in privatization.
40.
The case for implementing bolder structural reforms while the economy is still
in a period of strength is compelling. It is reinforced by substantial downside risks to the
outlook. The policy room built up would help address the diminishing gains from energy
trade—notably its impact on fiscal revenues—and support the necessary reduction in fiscal
subsidies and transfers. Implementing productivity-enhancing structural reforms while the
economy is growing rapidly would also make covering their up-front costs easier. An
improved investment climate would help attract FDI, facilitating faster export growth
through technology inflows, and enhanced access to foreign markets.
41.
The consequences of piecemeal reforms appear unattractive. Implementing only
moderate changes and retaining state domination of the economy would create increasing
macroeconomic and social costs as the external environment worsens and traditional sources
of growth fade. While the costs could in principle be financed for some time given the
current low external debt, this approach would necessitate larger adjustment down the road.
42.
The key task is to reduce state intervention and improve the business
environment. Directed lending, whose cumulative long-term costs remain partially
unaddressed by recurrent bank recapitalizations, should be eliminated as soon as feasible. If
subsidies to specific sectors are deemed necessary, these should come directly from the
budget. Pervasive controls on price formation should be discontinued, cross-subsidization
via state-owned enterprises abolished, and the golden share rule drastically curtailed.
Mandatory wage increases should cease.
43. The quality and timeliness of statistical data are broadly adequate for
surveillance, although macroeconomic analysis is encumbered in some areas. Belarus
subscribes to the Special Data Dissemination Standard, publishing extensive statistics.
However, administrative controls in the economy may affect the meaning of statistical data

29
and hence hamper staff’s macroeconomic analysis in key areas. Moreover, the weights in
the CPI basket remain inaccessible, and the statistical discrepancy in national accounts data
is relatively large.
44. The next Article IV consultation is proposed to be conducted under the standard
12-month cycle.

1/ Derived as [r - g - ρ(1+g) + εα(1+r)]/(1+g+ρ+gρ) times previous period debt stock, with r = nominal effective interest rate on external debt; ρ = change in domestic GDP deflator in US dollar terms,
g = real GDP growth rate, e = nominal appreciation (increase in dollar value of domestic currency), and a = share of domestic-currency denominated debt in total external debt.
2/ The contribution from price and exchange rate changes is defined as [-ρ(1+g) + εα(1+r)]/(1+g+ρ+gρ) times previous period debt stock. ρ increases with an appreciating domestic currency (ε > 0)
and rising inflation (based on GDP deflator).
3/ Defined as current account deficit, plus amortization on medium- and long-term debt, plus short-term debt at end of previous period.
4/ The key variables include real GDP growth; nominal interest rate; dollar deflator growth; and both non-interest current account and non-debt inflows in percent of GDP.
5/ The implied change in other key variables under this scenario is discussed in the text.
6/ Long-run, constant balance that stabilizes the debt ratio assuming that key variables (real GDP growth, nominal interest rate, dollar deflator growth, and non-debt inflows in percent of GDP) remain
at their levels of the last projection year.

B1. Nominal interest rate is at baseline plus one-half standard deviation
B2. Real GDP growth is at baseline minus one-half standard deviations
B3. Non-interest current account is at baseline minus one-half standard deviations
B4. Combination of B1-B3 using 1/4 standard deviation shocks
B5. One time 30 percent real depreciation in 2006

Safeguards Assessments:

As there is no arrangement in place, under the Fund’s safeguards assessments policy, the
National Bank of Belarus (NBB) is not subject to a full safeguards assessment. However, as a
potential borrower, the NBB requested a voluntary safeguards assessment, and an on-site
assessment was conducted in December 2003. The assessment concluded that significant
vulnerabilities existed in the safeguards framework, especially in the areas of the legal
structure and independence, external and internal audit, and in financial reporting. The
assessment made specific recommendations to correct the identified shortcomings. The
authorities have begun to address some of these issues, and are considering appropriate
measures to address the remaining concerns.

39
VIII.

Exchange Arrangements:

As of August 20, 1994, the rubel (Br) became the unit of account replacing the Belarusian
ruble, which was formally recognized as the sole legal tender only on May 18, 1994. The
conversion took place at the rate of 10 Belarusian rubles = 1 rubel. The authorities decided to
drop three zeroes from the rubel denomination as of January 1, 2000. The exchange rate for
the U.S. dollar was Br 2149 on April 18, 2006.
In mid-September 2000, the official exchange rate was unified with the market-determined
rate resulting from daily auctions at the Belarus Currency and Stock Exchange. Since then, the
official rate on any day is equal to the closing rate of the previous trading day. In line with the
objective to reach monetary union with Russia, the authorities adopted a crawling band vis-àvis the Russian ruble in January 2001, with monthly rates of devaluation that are revised
quarterly and a band of currently 5 percentage points around central parity. On November 5,
2001, Belarus accepted the obligations of Article VIII, Sections 2, 3, and 4 of the IMF’s
Articles of Agreement. During the same month, the NBB suspended all ad hoc exemptions
from the 30 percent surrender requirement.

UFR/Article IV Consultation:

Belarus is on a 12-month consultation cycle. The 12th Article IV consultation was concluded

APPENDIX II. RELATIONS WITH THE WORLD BANK
Partnership in Belarus’ development strategy
1.
According to the recent Country Assistance Strategy for Belarus the World Bank
Group aims to advance cooperation in critical areas, help the country open up its economy
and society, minimize social and environmental risks, and address global public good
concerns.
IMF-World Bank collaboration in specific areas
2.
The Bank and Fund teams work closely in Belarus and maintain an extremely good
relationship. The IMF plays a key role at the macro level, while the World Bank focuses on
the structural agenda, social and environmental issues. The Bank and the Fund teams carry
out joint activities on the key fiscal and structural issues. The joint work on the Public
Expenditure Review (PER), Financial Sector Assessment Program (FSAP) and the Country
Economic Memorandum (CEM) - are examples of excellent cooperation between the two
institutions.
Areas in which the World Bank leads
3.
Social sphere. The World Bank technical engagement with Belarus has generated a
significant amount of analysis in areas of relevance to the assessment of poverty and living
conditions in the country. A strong platform for technical collaboration on poverty issues
was provided by technical assistance under the IDF grant for Strengthening of the Capacity
of the Ministry of Social Protection in Policy Formulation and Analysis for preparation and
introduction of Targeted Social Assistance Program (TSAP). The Grant was implemented
successfully during 2000-2003 and completed in June 2003. In 2004 the Bank presented
study “Poverty Assessment. Can Poverty Reduction and Access to Services Be Sustained?”
offering a number of improvements to the methodology for measuring poverty and living
conditions in Belarus and contributing an in-depth analysis of the multiple dimensions of
poverty. Driven by demographic and socio-economic factors, Belarus faces a need for deep
pension system reform. To analyze current situation and discuss possible reform options the
World Bank team conducted a Pension Policy Dialogue with the Government during FY
2004.
4.
Energy sector. The Social Infrastructure Retrofitting Project (US$22.6 million) aims
to assist in the rehabilitation of the heating system, thermal insulation, and lighting in over
450 public buildings across the country. The project targets schools, hospitals, orphanages,
and community homes for the elderly and the disabled. It also includes measures to increase
energy efficiency.

43
5.
Energy Sector Management Assistance Program (ESMAP) grant (US$50.0 thousand,
completed in 2005). The project helped the Committee on Energy Efficiency explore market
mechanisms to improve energy efficiency through operation of Energy Servicing Companies
(ESCOs) and options of strengthening the energy efficiency program by learning experience
of neighboring countries that have managed to weather the impact of multi-fold energy prices
increases.
6.
Private-Public Infrastructure Advisory Facility project (US$350.0 thousand) was
approved in 2005. The project will help to advance the transition to market principles and
encourage private sector involvement in the Belarus energy sector by providing regulatory,
institutional and other support to create an environment that is conducive to private investment.
While recognizing that the environment for private investments is not conducive in Belarus, the
government has considered some reform scenarios that draw on experience gained by
neighboring countries, and is seeking technical assistance in the evaluation and implementation
of such scenarios.
7.
Environment. Belarus has made good progress in the protection of environment.
However, the country is still facing many environmental problems, including coping with the
legacy of the Chernobyl accident. The Post-Chernobyl Recovery Project (approved on April
18, 2006) is designed to revitalize selected regions of the country, affected by the Chernobyl
accident, by improving local people’s living conditions, reinforcing the energy efficiency and
environmental safeguards. The project is based on the recommendations of the Chernobyl
Review (2002) and also intended to spearhead greater support of the international community
to the affected regions of the country.
8.
PHRD Climate Change Pilot Project (US$1.0 million, approved in 2003) is aimed at
demonstrating opportunities for greenhouse gas (GHG) emission abatement through energy
efficiency and renewable energy utilization in the supply of heat and hot water to social
sector buildings, and assisting the Belarusian Government with the development and
implementation of emission standards for biomass-fired boilers, thereby removing an
institutional barrier to broader introduction of energy supply based on biomass fuel.
9.
GEF POPs Enabling Activity Project (US$499,300). After a two-year dialogue and
preparation activities in cooperation with UNEP, Belarus ratified the Stockholm Convention
on Persistent Organic Pollutants (POPs) and selected the World Bank as a GEF
Implementing Agency for the POPs activities. The project objective is to develop a National
Implementation Plan (NIP) for POPs to reduce volume and ultimately eliminate the
persistent organic pollutants stockpiles, consistent with the protection of human health and
the environment. Preparation of a follow-up GEF investment project is under consideration.

44

Areas of shared responsibility
10.
Economic development. The Bank team cooperated closely with the IMF on the
issues related to the preparation of the Country Economic Memorandum (CEM), with one
chapter - “Macroeconomic policies and risks,” prepared jointly. This chapter reviews the
country’s macroeconomic developments since 1996, the sources and structure of growth, and
analyzes the role of macroeconomic policies in Belarus’s growth performance. Special
attention was paid to the risks associated with Belarus’s current macroeconomic position,
and how these risks might be addressed effectively through adjustments in monetary policy,
fiscal policy, and debt management.
11.
Private sector development. The most challenging reform agenda for Belarus is in
the area of structural reforms and private business development. The Bank Group seeks to
improve the general environment for the creation and operation of private business in
Belarus through technical assistance, policy dialogue and ESW. The Bank and the IFC
conducted a number of studies including Improving the Business Environment and Costs of
Doing Business Surveys to track the developments in this area, define impediments to private
business expansion and provide policy recommendations. The Fund focuses on
macroeconomic policies aimed at sustainable growth and encouraging private sector
development. The Fund also provides technical assistance to improve taxation, banking
regulations and banking supervision.
12.
Public expenditure management. The current CAS attaches great importance to
fiscal issues, emphasizing the goals of greater effectiveness, transparency, and accountability
in the use of public resources. In 2003 the World Bank with the IMF participation completed
the first Public Expenditure Review (PER) for Belarus.
13.
The IMF and the Bank provide continuous technical assistance to Belarus in the area
of public expenditure management. The Government has determined the following priority
areas: modernization of budget classification, Budget Code preparation, MTEF, reform of
inter-budgetary fiscal relations, and development of sector strategies. During FY2004 the
Bank provided technical assistance to the Ministry of Finance for Budget Code preparation.
In FY2005 efforts have been focused on assisting the Government in the area of
intergovernmental fiscal relations, in particular, in clarification of revenues and expenditures
assignments for different level of the Government and in the development of formula for
intergovernmental fiscal transfers. In FY 2006 the assistance has been provided for
preparation of budget programs’ description and other basic documents required for the
introduction of performance-based budgeting (PBB).

45
14.
Financial sector. The FSAP for Belarus (2005) has been centered on assessments of
the banking system, including deposit insurance, securities markets, insurance industry,
payment system and transparency in conducting monetary policy. Regulations, oversight and
governance arrangements has been reviewed also. The Bank and the IMF also carry out joint
responsibility for providing assistance to Belarus in the prevention of money laundering and
combating financing of terrorism.
In the context of the CIS Payments and Securities Settlement Initiative (CISPI), the
World Bank-lead mission visited Minsk in spring 2006 to review the payment and securities
settlement systems of the Republic of Belarus. The CISPI is a cooperative effort lead by the
World Bank. Its objective is to describe and assess the payments systems of the countries of
the CIS with a view to identifying possible improvement measures in their safety, efficiency
and integrity.
15.
Statistical capacity-building. The IMF and the World Bank provide technical
assistance in the area of statistics to the Ministry of Statistics and Analysis, National Bank
and the Ministry of Finance. Trust Fund for Statistical Capacity Building (TFSCB) grant
(US$108.0 thousand, 2005) was designed to assist the GOB in the design of the National
Strategy for the Development of Statistics (NSDS), which will provide Belarus with the
strategy for strengthening statistical capacity across the entire national statistical system.
Areas in which the IMF leads
16.
The IMF is actively engaged with the Authorities in discussing the macroeconomic
program providing them with technical assistance and related support, including on
economic and financial statistics, tax policy, monetary operations and fiscal transparency.
The IMF is leading the dialogue on setting the objectives for monetary and exchange rate
policies, public debt management, overall budget envelope and tax policy.
17.
The IMF analysis in these areas serves as an input to the Bank policy advice. The
Bank and the IMF teams have regular consultations and the Bank staff takes part in the IMF
Article IV Consultation missions. This helps to ensure consistency of the policy
recommendations by the two institutions.
The World Bank Group Strategy
18.
Belarus joined the World Bank in July 1992. Bank relations with Belarus have
generally paralleled those of the IMF. Under the 1999 CAS, liberalization of the exchange
rate was set as a trigger for moving to a low case lending (one project per year) scenario. The
unification of the exchange rate in September 2000 allowed the Bank to proceed with the
preparation of a US$22.6 million Social Infrastructure Retrofitting Project, approved on
June 5, 2001. An improved technical dialogue between the World Bank Group and the
Belarus authorities preceded the preparation of the 2002-04 CAS. In the low case, the CAS
focused on the areas compatible with government priorities and the Bank’s corporate
mandate—global public goods and interventions with a high social content. The CAS left the

46
door open for a broader assistance by spelling out triggers for a base case, should the
Government advance in public expenditure reform and improve business environment.
19.
The Country Assistance Review (2004) recommended completing the key elements
of latest CAS before initiation of the new strategy of engagement. This included, completion
of ongoing ESW, particularly the CEM and the FSAP; continuation of the environment
initiatives, and finalization of the Chernobyl Project. The next CAS for Belarus will be
prepared in the first half of FY07.
20.
To date, the Bank has committed the total of US$240.6 million, and US$15.0 million
has been provided in the form of grants. The IBRD Belarus active portfolio has one ongoing
operation – Social Sector Energy Retrofitting Project totaling US$22.6 million. The PostChernobyl Recovery Project (US$50.0 million) was approved by the Executive Board on
April 18, 2006.
21.
Non-lending activities include extensive analytical work. The most recent work
includes the report entitled Belarus: Chernobyl Review (2002), a Public Expenditure and
Institutional Review (Belarus: Strengthening Public Resource Management, 2003) and a
Poverty Assessment Update (Belarus Poverty Assessment: Preparing for the Future, 2004),
Country Economic Memorandum (Belarus: Window of Opportunity to Enhance
Competitiveness and Sustain Economic Growth, 2005) and Financial Sector Assessment
Program (2005)
22.
The IFC activities in Belarus. The International Finance Corporation has been
actively involved in advisory work in Belarus since 1993. The work began with the advisory
services on privatization of small businesses. Currently IFC focuses its efforts on small and
medium enterprise development and improvement of the business environment.
23.
In December 2004 IFC has launched a Business Enabling Environment Project
funded jointly with the Swedish International Development Cooperation Agency (SIDA).
This two-year technical assistance effort will aim at reducing the regulatory burden on small
and medium enterprises and improving their access to information and business support
services.
24.
In addition to the advisory services the IFC is also pursuing investment activities in
Belarus. It has invested a total of US$71 million in four projects in the financial and
manufacturing sectors, including credit lines extended to Priorbank and Belgazprombank for
on-lending to private enterprises and providing loan and equity for the refurbishment,
modernization and expansion of Dednovo brewery. Despite the difficult investment

47
environment in Belarus, IFC continues to seek opportunities for investment projects with the
participation of the strategic investors.

APPENDIX III. BELARUS: STATISTICAL ISSUES
1. The quality and timeliness of statistical data are broadly adequate for surveillance,
although macroeconomic analysis is encumbered in some areas. While weaknesses remain in
the statistical system of Belarus, the authorities, with the help of technical assistance from the
Fund, have made significant efforts and improvements over the past years in a number of key
areas, as described below. The Ministry of Statistics and Analysis of the Republic of Belarus
(Minstat) publishes a large amount of data and has a predetermined publication schedule.
The provision of data over the last year has generally been adequate for the analysis of
economic developments on a regular basis.
2. The country’s IFS page was published since November 1996 and is updated regularly
on a monthly basis. A Statistics Law was signed by the President in February 1997. A
multisector statistical advisor sponsored by the Fund was in place from August 1996 to
August 2000.
3.
The data ROSC mission that visited Minsk in early 2004 found that all statistical
agencies face the challenge of increasing users’ confidence in the accuracy and reliability of
official statistics.
4.
The authorities subscribed to the IMF’s Special Data Dissemination Standard (SDDS)
on December 22, 2004: http://www.belstat.gov.by/homep/en/specst/np.htm.
National Accounts
5.
National accounts are compiled in accordance with the System of National Accounts
of 1993 (SNA 1993). GDP is compiled by the production, the expenditure and the income
approaches, and covers the entire economic territory of the Republic of Belarus. Data on
GDP are disseminated on a quarterly basis (in national currency) in current and constant
market prices (2000=100) expressed as absolute values.
6.
GDP figures are likely to be distorted by the underreporting of newly emerging
sectors—in particular services—and an active informal sector. A systematic upward bias in
measuring industrial output has also led to significant inaccuracies in GDP estimates. In
addition, problems remain in calculating holding gains from inventories. Problems continue
to exist in measuring the capital stock and consumption of fixed capital. Estimates of GDP
by expenditure categories are still uncertain. The authorities have prepared an alternative
series on industrial output that corrects some of the above problems, and these data, and the
requisite revisions to GDP, have been published from January 1, 2006.

49
Prices
7.
Data on Consumer Price Index (CPI) and the Producer Price Index (PPI) are being
reported to the Fund monthly on a timely basis. Both indices were developed with substantial
technical assistance from the Fund. As regards the PPI, in January 1995 a Laspeyres formula
recommended by the Fund was adopted. Other recommendations, such as inclusion of
exports, adequate specification of items, and better selection of representative products and
prices, have either been adopted or are in the process of being adopted. Since January 2001,
the PPI has been compiled using the 1999 weights; and beginning with 2003 data, with 2001
production weights.
Government Finance Statistics
8.
Since the 2004 data ROSC mission, the MOF has made progress in different areas of
collection, compilation, and dissemination of fiscal data. The authorities have extended the
coverage of the general government (republican and local government) operations by
including data for innovation funds, included the Social Protection Fund’s operations in the
budget, increased the number of officials involved in the GFS compilation work, established
a close coordination with the National Bank of the Republic of Belarus (NBRB) for the
reconciliation of fiscal and monetary datasets, and increased provision of detailed budgetary
metadata and methodological descriptions on the MOF’s website. In addition to these
improvements, the MOF has prepared new budgetary classifications codes for revenue,
expenditure, and financing data that will align them to the GFSM 2001 analytical framework.
9.
At the end of April 2005, a GFS technical assistance (TA) mission visited Minsk.
This mission found that the existing fiscal, accounting, and statistical systems have a sound
basis for migrating to the GSFM 2001. Nonetheless, several areas were identified that will
need further work before satisfactory implementation of the GFSM 2001. In order to provide
assistance in this area, the GFS TA mission collaborated with the authorities on the
preparation of a migration plan for a gradual implementation of this analytical framework.
10.
The authorities have reported GFS for 2003 and 2004 under the GFSM 2001
analytical framework for publication in the GFS Yearbook and started disseminating, through
the MOF’s website, fiscal data according to the IMF’s Special Data Dissemination Standard.
Monetary Statistics
11.
The balance sheet of the NBRB and the monetary survey are usually provided with a
lag of no more than two weeks; the bank monthly balance sheet is available on or about the
fifth of the month following the reference period, but monetary data for publication in IFS
are reported with a lag of about six weeks.
12.
Interest rate data on bank deposits and credits, as well as data on NBRB credit
auctions and the placement of NBRB and government securities, are provided with a onemonth lag. Exchange rate data are readily available on the NBRB’s web site, and periodically
reported to the Fund in electronic file.

50
13.
Following the TA mission of October 2005, the NBRB has compiled and submitted to
STA a pilot set of monetary data for December 2004 – November 2005 using the framework
of the new Standardized Report Forms (SRF). Subsequent STA review of the data validated
the resulting monetary aggregates and the authorities initiated regular reporting of current
monetary data in the SRF framework to EUR and STA. Also, the authorities and STA have
been working on converting historic monetary database beginning from December 2001 into
the SRF format for inclusion in the STA database and publication in on forthcoming IFS
Supplement.
Balance of Payments Statistics
14.
The overall quality and timeliness of external sector data is satisfactory. The
International Transactions Reporting System employed by the NBRB has been broadened to
permit a more accurate classification of external transactions, while coverage and reporting
forms for enterprise surveys were also improved. The NBRB publishes quarterly balance of
payments and international investment position statements in the BPM5 format on a timely
basis. Scheduled interest and amortization payments on public sector debt are tracked by the
MoF and reported to the Fund, and timely information is available on arrears on government
and government-guaranteed debt.
15.
Belarus has started to disseminate historical data on the reserves template on the
IMF's website: http://www.imf.org/external/np/sta/ir/colist.htm. Monthly time series start
with November 2004 data.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
August 25, 2006

International Monetary Fund
700 19th Street, NW
Washington, D. C. 20431 USA

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2006 Article IV Consultation with the
Republic of Belarus
On August 4, 2006, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded
the Article IV consultation with the Republic of Belarus.1
Background
Belarus’s centralized, state-dominated economy has performed well over the past few years.
The government’s centrally administered, socially oriented policies have facilitated rapid real
income growth, near-full employment, and a reduction in poverty to the lowest level in the CIS.
GDP growth averaged 8.2 percent in 2002–05. Favorable energy import prices have supported
high growth, particularly in 2005. A widening gap between world prices for Belarus’s energyintensive exports and prices of energy imports from Russia have provided a large and
increasing amount of trading gains. These have been distributed throughout the economy—
including through transfers and subsidies to state-owned enterprises, high budgetary
investment, as well as economy-wide mandated wage increases, and recommended lending—
supporting domestic demand. Belarus also benefited from strong partner country growth, which,
together with terms-of-trade improvements, helped swing the current account into a surplus of
1.6 percent of GDP in 2005. Moreover, economic stabilization and rising incomes have
strengthened consumer confidence, further contributing to increasing domestic demand. The
economy’s positive momentum has carried forward into 2006.
1

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On
return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the
Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the
Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the
country's authorities.

2
Ample production capacity has allowed twelve-month inflation to decline steadily over the past
few years, to 6.9 percent in May 2006. However, rising unit labor costs, tighter capacity
utilization in many sectors, a high and increasing ratio of Producer Price Index to Consumer
Price Index inflation, and estimates of underlying inflation suggest a build-up in inflation
pressures. Low inflation also reflects, in part, administrative controls over price formation.
Macroeconomic data may not tell the whole story. While the quality of statistics is generally
good, extensive state controls over the economy—notably on prices— complicate the
assessment of economic developments and of the impact of policy actions.
After a broad balance in 2004, the 2005 budget recorded a deficit of 0.7 percent of GDP,
despite a 2¼ percent of GDP revenue windfall from the booming energy sector and from the
switch to the destination principle for the value added tax in trade with Russia from the
beginning of 2005. The 2005 deficit excluding oil-related revenues of around 6 percent of GDP
suggests continued fiscal sensitivity to energy pricing. The 2006 budget recorded a—largely
seasonal—3.1 percent of GDP surplus through May against a budgeted full-year deficit of
1½ percent of GDP.
While officially targeting the Russian ruble, the National Bank of the Republic of Belarus (NBRB)
has maintained a stable exchange rate vis-à-vis the U.S. dollar, which facilitated further gradual
dedollarization and rapid increases in international reserves in 2005. The refinance rate was
reduced by 600 basis points in 2005 and by a further 50 in June 2006. Reserve requirements
were also lowered twice in 2005 and 2006, by one percentage point each time. These
developments triggered an increase in liquidity that the NBRB sterilized to a large extent, in a
context of further remonetization.
State banks continued to lend at the government’s behest for designated purposes mostly at
controlled and subsidized interest rates. The resulting decline in these banks’ liquidity and
profitability necessitated budgetary recapitalizations of 1.1 percent of GDP. NBRB credit to the
nonfinancial nongovernment sector has also increased, reaching ½ percent of GDP in April
2006. As a result, credit to the economy has continued growing, while the share of
nonperforming loans fell to below 2 percent at end-2005. Banks have improved provisioning,
covering about 90 percent of the requirement as of May 2006.
Progress with structural reforms has been limited. The remaining significant role of the state in
the economy and administrative restrictions on the movement of labor and in other areas
hamper market flexibility and private investment.
Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors noted that Belarus has enjoyed several years of relatively strong
macroeconomic performance. In particular, growth has been rapid since 2003, and inflation has
declined further, remaining in single digits since the second half of 2005. This economic
performance has reflected broadly the authorities’ pursuit of prudent fiscal and monetary

3
policies, as well as strong growth in partner countries, although price controls have also
contributed to declining inflation.
Most Directors observed that the strong growth of recent years owed much to energy imports
from Russia at markedly below-market prices, while prices for Belarus’s energy-intensive
exports had grown considerably. The resulting large and increasing terms-of-trade gains had
been redistributed, financing rapid wage increases, budgetary support to enterprises, and largescale investment projects that had underpinned the policy of strong government interference in
the economy.
Directors emphasized that the outlook seems much less favorable than recent trends. They
noted that current World Economic Outlook energy price projections suggest that terms-of-trade
gains are set to halt from 2007. Indeed, the possibility of significantly less subsidized energy
imports could impart a considerable downside risk to the outlook. Directors also pointed to
Belarus’s declining market share in the CIS, the large and growing non-oil current account
deficit, the low level of international reserves, and the diminishing output gap. In light of these
considerations, most Directors called for a fundamental change of course in policies, notably in
the structural and fiscal areas. In particular, they stressed the importance of an up-front fiscal
tightening, calling for early liberalization of prices and wages, followed by broader structural
reforms.
Directors welcomed the authorities’ intentions to implement fiscal and structural measures by
2010, especially to curb budgetary transfers and subsidies, reduce the tax burden, strengthen
the financial system, moderate real wage increases, and attract foreign investors. However,
Directors noted that a more rapid withdrawal of state intervention, including early liberalization
of prices and wages, would help to underpin strong noninflationary growth in the medium term.
They stressed that structural reform measures should be implemented without delay, while the
economy is still in a position of strength. In this context, several Directors noted the importance
of improving the institutional framework and governance, and several Directors pointed to the
need to build social consensus for the reforms. Directors welcomed the authorities’ strong track
record regarding the implementation of technical assistance from the Fund, and endorsed the
provision of further technical assistance in support of the reform agenda.
In particular, Directors argued for rapidly phasing out directed bank lending, bringing all
remaining state support to enterprises on-budget, ensuring that budgetary and public sector
wages grow in line with productivity, and curtailing the golden share rule to apply to only a
handful of preannounced strategic enterprises. Directors cautioned against using privatization
proceeds or increased foreign borrowing to sustain an unaltered state-dominated economic
structure—a strategy that would only postpone the inevitable macroeconomic adjustment, while
increasing its costs.
Directors argued that fiscal tightening, starting already in 2006, is necessary to cope with the
impact on the budget of a stabilization of the terms of trade. The case for this policy stance is
reinforced by the risk that the terms of trade might weaken, heightening the possibility that a
relatively loose fiscal policy would prompt inflationary pressures and undermine

4
competitiveness. Fiscal savings—primarily in the form of expenditure retrenchment—are also
required to finance the cost of structural reforms and offset the planned reduction in Belarus’s
high tax burden. With a view to safeguarding the effective social safety net and productivity
growth, these cuts should focus on phasing out subsidies and transfers to loss-making
enterprises, and discontinuing bank recapitalizations associated with directed lending. Directors
also noted the need to reduce budget rigidities by phasing out earmarking.
Turning to monetary policy, Directors believed the NBRB should clarify that controlling inflation
is its primary objective. In this regard, most Directors stressed that the NBRB should accept
more flexibility in the exchange rate in the event of inconsistency between the inflation and
exchange rate targets. They also found that further policy interest rate cuts should be contingent
on clear signs of lasting declines in inflationary pressures. Directors noted that to enhance the
credibility of the NBRB’s commitment to the inflation objective, its operational independence
would need to be strengthened, the number of its quantitative targets pruned, its direct lending
to the economy discontinued, and interest rate caps eliminated.
Directors commended the NBRB on the progress in strengthening the supervisory framework.
However, they emphasized that, against the backdrop of continued rapid credit growth, the
NBRB needs to remain vigilant in enforcing all prudential requirements. Directors welcomed the
recent steps toward attracting strategic foreign investors to the banking system, while stressing
the importance of transparent and competitive privatization procedures. It was also suggested
that anti-money laundering legislation should be improved to meet international best practices.
Directors noted that the quality of the statistical system and the timeliness of data are broadly
adequate.

Statement by Willy Kiekens, Executive Director for Republic of Belarus
and Mikhail V. Nikitsenka, Advisor to Executive Director
August 4, 2006
Economic Developments
The cooperation between the authorities and the staff has been constructive and has enabled
further convergence of views. The authorities share staff’s general assessment on the sources
of growth and medium-term policy goals. These include structural reforms, reducing the size
of the budget, strengthening the financial system, facilitating the development of small and
medium-size enterprises, wage moderation and improving the business climate. The
authorities are grateful for the technical assistance and advice, which was helpful for
designing and implementing economic policies and reforms.
The staff has analyzed the sources of growth in Belarus, which has enabled them to project
growth more accurately. In the past years, staff projections significantly underestimated
actual growth. Real growth in 2005 was 9.2 percent, or 2.1 percent above the staff projection.
For the first half of 2006, annualized growth has been already in excess of 10 percent. For the
year as a whole, growth is projected by the staff to be 7 percent.
The authorities agree that in Belarus, as elsewhere, macro-economic data must be assessed in
light of the specifics of the given economy. Nonetheless, they believe that par. 5 and par. 43
of the staff report and par. 5 of the background section of the draft PIN exaggerate the
difficulties for assessing Belarus’ economic developments and policies on the basis of what
are widely considered good quality statistical data. The Fund’s technical assistance report on
national accounts, finalized in April 2005, confirms that the methodology for compiling
national accounts is based on “sound techniques and procedures”, and that “regarding GDP
growth rates, the mission’s opinion is that the methods and procedures applied by the
Minstat are in accordance with international standards and the GDP data are consistent
with the source data”. At the same time, the report points to a possible upward bias in
recorded growth rates, in the order of 1 percentage point, because of methodological
shortcomings.
The staff concludes that high growth and falling inflation reflect rising labor productivity,
increased capacity utilization and favorable terms of trade. The authorities would like to
stress that the country’s favorable growth record is primarily the result of policies directed at
high savings and investments to upscale the country’s industrial potential and to make the
economy more energy efficient. In this respect, Belarus compares favorably with Russia and
Ukraine.

2

GDP growth is mainly export driven. Exports in U.S. dollar terms doubled in the last four
years. Belarus is now the most open economy among CIS countries. Exports to non-CIS
countries, mainly EU countries, have been growing fast and have now reached 52 percent of
total exports. While exports of fertilizers have dropped dramatically in the first quarter of
2006, exports of finalized goods, such as trucks, grew in the same period at the brisk pace of
66 percent.
Monetary and Exchange Policies
The decline in inflation, which is now among the lowest in the CIS countries, has greatly
enhanced Belarus’ external competitiveness. The central bank agrees with the staff that low
inflation, rather than the exchange rate, should be its principal policy objective. The 2007
monetary guidelines are consistent with this priority. However, the authorities continue to
believe that the crawling band exchange rate regime during the past years was instrumental in
reducing inflation, increasing external reserves and reducing the level of dollarization.
Low inflation, exchange rate stability, and robust growth, all have enhanced confidence and
demand for money. In parallel, bank assets have continued to grow at a brisk pace.
The Fund’s technical assistance was instrumental in improving bank regulation and
supervision. Financial soundness indicators for the banking system improved substantially.
The ratio of non-performing loans fell from 14.4 percent at the end of 2001 to 1.5 percent in
May of this year. At the same time, the authorities are aware that the country’s banking
system is still underdeveloped and must be further improved.
Fiscal Policy
Belarus continues to pursue a disciplined fiscal policy. Last year it showed a budget deficit of
0.7 percent of GDP. Buoyant revenue collection contributed to a budget surplus of 3.1
percent of GDP during the 5 first months of this year.
Transparency in the budget process has improved. In 2004, the extra budget pension fund
was integrated in the overall budget. Last year the innovation fund was also integrated in the
budget. Both operations increased the overall budget by 12.6 percent of GDP. As
recommended by the Fund, the government now considers its annual budgets within a
medium-term framework.
Belarus has borne a financial burden in relation to the Chernobyl catastrophe, and will do so
in the foreseeable future. On top of all the human suffering come the total financial costs,
which according to international experts, exceed 10 times the country’s GDP.

3

Structural Policies
Since the last Article IV consultation, the authorities have continued to improve institutions
and the business environment. An IFC study of the business environment in Belarus,
published in June 2006, highlights several improvements. The average number of inspections
of SMEs has dropped from 10 in 2004 to 7 in 2006. The average time required to issue a
license has also dropped from 45 days to 27 days.
Technical assistance provided by the IFC was helpful in preparing regulations on business
registration. The regulation, issued last April, provides for a one stop procedure and reduces
both expenses and time needed to complete the procedure. To give an example, the number
of documents required for registration will be reduced from 13 to 4. The IFC estimates that
the overall cost of a registration will be reduced by 21 percent. The decree also provides that
all formalities will not take more than 30 days. Moreover, it eliminates all penalties for not
complying with the time limits for submitting documents.
In order to improve the access of SMEs to information, an Internet portal “Belarus SME
Toolkit” (www.bel.biz.url) was launched in May 2006. The website covers a multitude of
business related issues: legislation, support services, etc. The portal is updated daily and
contains all the administrative information which an entrepreneur might require for running
the business.
In the most recent five year plan, the government envisages to cut taxes and subsidies, to
facilitate the functioning of SMEs, to strengthen the financial system and to attract foreign
capital. Belarus has already nine banks that are now fully owned by foreigners. The so called
“Golden Share” no longer applies to banks. This should encourage the entry of strategic
foreign investors. Today the golden share rule applies in only 14 enterprises for a limited
period of 1 to 5 years. This year, the government’s golden share will lapse in eight
enterprises, thereby only leaving six enterprises with the golden share.
The authorities made a strong effort to reduce the level of cross subsidization. Utility cost
recovery ratios increased from 21.7 percent in 2001 to 50.7 percent in 2006. The recent
World Bank Report “Belarus: Addressing Challenges Facing the Energy Sector”, concludes
that cost-recovery tariffs allowed enterprises to finance their investment programs, fully pay
current bills, and significantly reduce the stock of debt related to energy imports from Russia.
In April 2006, less than 20 percent of enterprises were loss making, compared to the 26.2
percent one year earlier.
Wage increases are no longer mandatory for the economy as a whole. Every enterprise now
has its own wage policy, according to financial affordability.

4

Relations between Belarus and the Fund
In Belarus gradualism proved conducive to economic stability and maintaining high social
standards. The country has the lowest level of poverty among the CIS countries.
The authorities recognize the difference of views with the staff, and would have preferred
these differences to be resolved by a more intense dialogue. The authorities believe that both,
an IMF resident representative in Belarus and a greater continuity in the IMF staff team
working on Belarus, would be beneficial in this regard. They would like to benefit from the
high quality of technical assistance and would prefer full-fledged consultations rather than
streamlined staff visits.
In conclusion, we would like to convey the intention of the Belarusian authorities to continue
with disciplined monetary and fiscal policies and to improve the business climate so as to
sustain economic growth. The authorities are confident that the Board will recognize the
positive macroeconomic developments and encourage management to provide capacity
building assistance to help the country strengthen its policies, reforms and economic
performance.
