STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2012 ARTICLE IV CONSULTATION

KEY ISSUES
Context. GDP is projected to contract by 1½ percent in 2012, owing to a severe
drought that impacted agriculture in Q1. Non-agricultural activity is, however, expected
to grow at slightly below potential, supported by stimulative fiscal and monetary
policies. With the drought now over, robust domestic demand, and strong confidence,
a rapid turn-around in activity is expected over the coming months. Next year, GDP
would expand by 8½ percent as weather conditions normalize and agriculture recovers.
Inflation would remain in line with the central bank target (5 percent) in 2012-13.
Near-term policies. The current policy mix is appropriately supportive of activity and
broadly consistent with meeting the inflation target in 2012. Fiscal and monetary policy
can do little to mitigate the direct effect of the drought on agriculture, and should react
only to the extent that there are spillovers to the rest of the economy and inflation
remains under control. It is important to avoid relaxing these policies further, while
allowing the exchange rate to help mitigate the supply shock. Inflationary pressures
might resurface as 2013 approaches and the economy rebounds, and the authorities
would need to be ready to tighten policies in a timely fashion. Protecting financial
stability calls for keeping credit growth under control, continuing bolstering regulation
and supervision, and strengthening the sector’s buffers. It is also important to close
information gaps in the financial sector.
Tax reform. The tax system needs to be improved to increase revenues. Higher
revenues are needed to support upgrading basic infrastructure, improving social
indicators and human capital, and reducing poverty. It is important to implement
promptly the personal income tax, and improve agricultural taxation by limiting
generous deductions and closing loopholes. There is also scope to raise the tax
contribution of the financial sector, including by broadening the tax base and raising
the currently-low VAT rate on financial services.

PARAGUAY

BACKGROUND
1.

GDP growth slowed down markedly in 2011 and turned negative in 2012Q1 (Figure

1). After a strong rebound in 2010 led by agriculture, growth slowed down to 3.8 percent in
2011, reflecting both monetary tightening and country-specific supply shocks. Against the
backdrop of inflationary pressures, the central bank continued increasing interest rates through
the third quarter of 2011. At the same time, cement shortages and an outbreak of foot-andmouth disease followed by a beef export ban, impacted strongly the non–agricultural sector,
which expanded by less than 3 percent in the year. The non-agricultural output gap (a more
appropriate measure of demand pressures in Paraguay) turned negative in the third quarter of
2011 reaching about -1 percent in the last quarter. Unemployment declined slightly to about 5½
percent in 2011, while underemployment remained high, at above 20 percent. A severe drought
hit the country in late 2011-early 2012 and is estimated to have caused significant losses in the
agricultural sector, especially for key export products (e.g., soybeans). High frequency indicators
suggest that GDP contracted by over 3 percent (y/y) in 2012Q1 as a result of the drought, but
non-agricultural activity grew at close to 4½ percent.
2.

Inflation has declined below the central bank target, but core inflation has

remained relatively high (Figure 1). After peaking at over 10 percent (y/y) in early 2011,
inflation began easing in mid-year, reaching 5 percent
(the central bank target) at year-end and falling further to

in meat prices following the export ban. Tighter monetary
conditions and a substantial appreciation of the guaraní
(see chart) also played a role in reducing inflation

remained somewhat above the official target for headline inflation, reflecting mainly still strong
domestic demand growth and one-off factors.2
3.

Credit growth has moderated, helping reduce domestic demand pressures and

financial sector risks (Figure 2). From mid-2010 to
August 2011 the central bank (BCP) raised the policy

demand growth has moderated, although it remains
above potential output growth.
4.

Against a backdrop of easing inflation and external uncertainty, the BCP began

cutting interest rates in late 2011. The BCP reduced the policy rate by 200 bps between
November 2011 and February, and by an additional 25 bps in May (to 6¼ percent). In easing
monetary policy, the BCP cited initially the softening of inflation and risks from an uncertain
global economic outlook and, more recently, weakening domestic demand growth. While the
real policy rate remains positive (at around 1¼ percent), it is below its neutral level (Box 1). This
seems broadly consistent with the current negative output gap.
5.

The current account deficit improved and international reserves continued to grow

in 2011 (Figure 3). Despite the negative shock to beef exports and the appreciation of the
guaraní (by 14 percent in real effective terms during 2011), the external current account deficit
declined to 1¼ percent of GDP in 2011 (from 3½ percent of GDP in 2010). The improvement
reflected better terms of trade, a stronger services account (mainly related to electricity royalty
payments by Brazil and Argentina), and higher worker remittances. Capital inflows, notably
2

The main one-off factor in early 2012 was related to higher education costs, owing to a new law that introduced
obligatory social security contributions for private schools. This has contributed about ½ percentage points to
the increase in core inflation since December 2011, with the rest of the uptick attributed to domestic demand
factors and exchange-rate pass-through.

External financial developments might have also played a role in lowering credit growth. See Selected Issues

foreign direct investment, remained strong, allowing the BCP to increase net international
reserves by 1½ percent of GDP in 2011, to about 24 percent of GDP. The central bank continued
to intervene on both sides of the market during 2011, aiming at limiting excessive exchange rate
volatility. More recently, in 2012Q1, the BCP sold a sizeable amount of FX to (i) withdraw an
unexpected large liquidity injection by the government (which used BCP deposits to, inter alia,
pay-off outstanding accounts payable), and (ii) stem strong depreciation pressures following the
drought. These operations prevented the exchange rate from depreciating in response to the
drought-induced supply shock. FX intervention in 2011–12 appears to have limited exchange rate
flexibility (Box 2).
6.

Fiscal policy was slightly expansionary in 2011 (Figure 4). The overall fiscal surplus

declined by ½ percentage points, to 1 percent of GDP, driven by a large increase in primary
spending (especially capital expenditures). This implied a fiscal impulse (measured by the change
in the structural primary balance) of about ¾ percent of GDP. Revenue growth decelerated but
remained strong, supported by continued improvements in tax administration. Public debt
continued on a declining trend, with general government debt falling below 14 percent of GDP,
one of the lowest in the region.
7.

The banking sector has remained sound, but NPLs have risen. Profitability is high and

capital adequacy ratios remain strong. NPLs are low (2 percent in March), but have risen over the
last year.4 More stringent provisioning measures and higher capital requirements became
effective in January 2012, helping strengthen financial institutions’ buffers. A program to bolster
the prudential and regulatory framework of the cooperative sector is being implemented.

Provisions have also declined. However, this reflects changes in the composition of NPLs, with the share of
recently overdue loans (which carry a lower provision) increasing. Regulations on provisioning have actually been

2012 ARTICLE IV REPORT

Congress recently approved legislation to shift public sector deposits from commercial banks to
a state-owned bank. These deposits amount to about 6 percent of GDP and its abrupt shifting
and concentration could strongly impact the liquidity distribution within the banking system. The
initiative is on hold as the BCP has filed a suit with the Supreme Court challenging the legislation
on constitutional grounds.

MACROECONOMIC OUTLOOK AND RISKS
8.

The economy is projected to contract in 2012 as a result of the recent drought. Staff

projects real GDP to fall by 1½ percent, driven by a decline in agricultural activity of about
25 percent. While spillovers from agriculture to the rest of the economy seem modest,5 the
agricultural contraction would have a notable effect on the non-agricultural sector, given the size
of the shock. However, following the 2012Q1 contraction, a rapid recovery is expected. Growth is
likely to turn positive already in 2012Q2,
supported in the non-agricultural sector by high
confidence, a strong fiscal impulse, stimulative
monetary conditions, and the partial reversion of
negative supply shocks that hit the sector in

weather conditions will positively impact the
agricultural sector next year and GDP would expand by 8½ percent, before stabilizing around
potential over the medium term.
9.

Inflation is expected to remain at about 5 percent in 2012. Upward pressure on

inflation should be relatively muted in 2012 given: (i) a slightly negative output gap; (ii) subdued
global commodity prices; and (iii) local food price increases limited by the existing beef export
ban. Inflationary pressures, however, may arise toward next year once the export ban is lifted and
economic activity rebounds strongly. These pressures and their impact on expectations can be
contained as long as the BCP appropriately tightens monetary policy in a timely fashion and

10.

The external current account would temporarily weaken in 2012, owing to the

supply shocks. Agricultural exports are projected to contract sharply as a result of the drought,
while beef exports would remain essentially stagnant due to the current ban. While the decline in
overall exports is expected to be partially offset by lower imports, the current account deficit is
projected to rise above 3 percent of GDP. This deterioration would be reversed in 2013, with the
recovery of agriculture and the expected lifting of the export ban in late 2012, with the current
account deficit stabilizing at around 1¼ percent of GDP over the medium.
11.

Fiscal policy would provide significant stimulus to economic activity in 2012. As

reflected in the government’s Financial Plan, the 2012
budget envisages a sizeable loosening of fiscal policy.

percent, with an impact on pensions through the existing indexing mechanism), mostly
determined by congress.6 Staff projects real revenue to grow by 3½ percent in 2012, supported
by increased electricity royalty payments from Brazil (following the new agreement on Itaipú) and
a still relatively robust domestic demand.7 The 2012 stimulus is projected to be withdrawn only
slowly, with the government accounts remaining in deficit through 2014. However, in line with
recent historical experience in Paraguay, it is expected that deficits would remain modest.
Against this background, while general government debt would rise to over 14 percent of GDP in
2012, it would resume its declining trend in 2013, aided by the strong rebound in economic
growth.
12.

Main risks to the short-term outlook are as follows (Annex 1):


Growth and inflation. While weaker-than-expected global growth would hurt activity
in Paraguay, the main risk to domestic growth in 2012 comes from the drought’s
spillovers to domestic demand, which could be stronger than currently estimated.8 In
such a scenario, real GDP would contract more than envisaged in the baseline, with
possible effects on the financial sector and the fiscal accounts. For 2013, risks to
growth and inflation are overall tilted to the upside: the agricultural rebound could
be even stronger than currently envisaged, and non-agricultural activity could also
expand more rapidly on the back of strong domestic demand growth—leading to
higher inflationary pressures—although this could be dampened by lower global
growth.



Financial sector. The contraction of agriculture in 2012 and related spillovers might
lead to higher NPLs, although this risk looks limited as farmers have large buffers
from very high profits in recent years. Banks have relatively strong capital and lossrelated reserve buffers, and should be able to deal with a moderate rise in NPLs.
Credit to the private sector expanded rapidly in the last few years, but risks to
financial stability from a credit bubble have declined lately, given the recent marked

6

Through its Financial Plan (FP), the government has some ability to alter spending plans approved by congress,
but cannot change wages. For 2012 the FP cut spending by over 1 percent of GDP relative to the approved
budget. The public sector wage increase is not expected to influence wage growth in the private sector, which
tends to follow the minimum wage. The latter is adjusted in line with 12-month inflation when inflation is 10
percent or higher; otherwise it is set discretionally by the government. With inflation running well below 10
percent, minimum wage and overall private sector wage growth are expected to be modest in 2012.

7

The agricultural contraction will have a very limited direct impact on revenues, given that the sector’s
contribution to tax collections is negligible.

deceleration in credit growth and the strengthening of buffers in the banking sector.
The possibility that public sector deposits at commercial banks might be shifted to a
state-owned bank constitutes a risk to financial stability, as it would abruptly affect
private banks’ funding sources and the liquidity distribution within the financial
system.


Fiscal accounts. With general elections in 2013 and ongoing pressures for higher
spending, downside risks dominate in the near term, especially given the ability of
the Paraguayan congress to independently increase expenditures. A weaker fiscal
stance could lead to a higher external current account deficit and inflation, and to a
more depreciated exchange rate, which could fuel second-round inflationary
pressures.

13.

Medium-term risks stem mainly from the external environment (Annex 1). These

include a large decline in commodity prices and a substantially weaker external demand.9 At
present, staff considers these risks to be low to medium. However, were they to materialize, they
would have a significant impact on Paraguay’s highly-open and commodity-dependent
economy. In such a scenario, the external current account would weaken, and the guaraní could
be put under significant pressure. This would tend to push inflation up, although weaker
economic activity would partially offset such pressures. Economic activity would be broadly
affected, putting strong pressure on the financial system given that the non-agricultural sector
has weaker buffers. These risks highlight the importance of continuing bolstering financial sector
cushions while improving bank regulation and supervision. Fiscal risks are also tilted to the
downside, given the powers of congress and its tendency to produce expansionary budgets.

POLICY DISCUSSIONS
14.

Focus of the consultation. The 2012 consultation focused on (i) macroeconomic and

financial policies needed to maintain stability against the backdrop of supply shocks; (ii)
improving the tax system to raise the revenue ratio to help fund higher spending on basic social
and infrastructure needs; and (iii) increasing long-term growth and other structural issues.
15.

Implementation of past Fund policy advice. The previous Article IV consultation (IMF

Country Report 11/238) highlighted the need to gear short-run policies toward moderating

domestic demand pressures and returning to a more balanced growth path, in order to reduce
inflation, contain the external current account deficit, and preserve financial stability. It also
stressed the need to advance on the implementation of structural reforms in the monetary, fiscal,
and financial sectors. There has been progress in several of these areas, but implementation has
lagged in some others. In particular, monetary tightening has helped moderate domestic
demand growth and lower inflation, against the backdrop of a substantial deceleration in credit
growth (paragraphs 2-3) There have also been advances in financial sector reforms (paragraph 7
and Box 5) and in strengthening the monetary framework (Box 6), but further steps should be
taken. Progress has been slower on fiscal reforms (e. g., fiscal framework and tax reform), which
in the case of tax policy reflects largely the government’s lack of a majority in congress.

A. Near-Term Macroeconomic and Financial Sector Policies
16.

Policies need to focus on keeping inflation in line with the official target and the

external current account deficit under control, while protecting financial stability. The
current policy mix is supportive of economic activity and broadly consistent with achieving the
BCP inflation target in 2012. Given the nature of the shock buffeting the Paraguayan economy
this year, there are limits to how much macroeconomic policies can do to cushion its effects on
activity. The authorities concurred that policies cannot do much to mitigate the direct impact of
the drought on agriculture, and should react only to the extent that there are spillovers to the
rest of the economy, provided that the inflation dynamics allow it. Limiting risks to financial
stability calls for maintaining close monitoring of credit growth, continuing bolstering regulation
and supervision, and strengthening financial sector’s buffers.
17.

The mission recommended to avoid easing monetary policy further and to stand

ready to tighten if the recent inflation dynamics reverse. The current policy rate is below its
neutral level. This appears to be broadly consistent with a negative output gap in the nonagricultural sector and meeting the BCP inflation target in 2012, given that food inflation would
remain subdued. Interest rates could be eased further only if there were clear signs of weakerthan-anticipated non-agricultural growth or external demand were set to decline significantly,
and the dynamics of core inflation showed clear signs of softening. Staff also noted that
inflationary pressures will likely increase as 2013 approaches, once the beef export ban is lifted
and economic activity recovers. The BCP should be ready to tighten monetary policy accordingly
to keep inflation in line with the target. The authorities agreed with this assessment. Consistent
with this, in its last policy communiqué, the BCP appropriately suggested that the policy rate had

reached a minimum in the current easing cycle and signaled an increase in rates towards
2012Q4.
18.

There is room for greater exchange rate flexibility. Staff stressed that FX intervention

should be limited to dealing with excessive volatility and to prevent potential disorderly
movements in the FX market. 10 The mission noted that, at the current juncture, some
depreciation of the exchange rate would help cushion the impact of the drought on economic
activity and the external sector. With a strong rebound of agriculture in 2013, pressures for the
guaraní to strengthen might arise. While considering that some FX intervention could be
appropriate in that context to smooth out sharp movements in the exchange rate, staff stressed
the importance of not resisting the trend and letting the exchange rate play its role in containing
any inflationary pressures.
19.

Staff emphasized the importance of improving liquidity management. Excess

liquidity is a structural problem in Paraguay, complicating the implementation of monetary policy
and limiting its effectiveness. This is especially relevant in a context in which the BCP is moving
towards an inflation targeting regime. The BCP has been trying to address this problem by
fostering the interbank market. In this regard, staff encouraged the authorities to move to
average reserves requirements as soon as feasible. The BCP indicated that it will implement this
change later this year once a new payments system is in place (see paragraph 29). Staff also
indicated that the BCP should consider issuing long-term paper to absorb liquidity if unexpected
spikes reappear, given that relying on FX operations can have unintended consequences on the
exchange rate (see paragraph 5). In this context, staff also encouraged the authorities to improve
communication and coordination between the BCP and the Ministry of Finance to avoid large,
unexpected changes in public deposits at the central bank.
20.

There was agreement on the need to avoid further relaxation of fiscal policy in 2012

and start withdrawing fiscal stimulus next year. Fiscal policy is already providing a strong
stimulus to the economy this year. The authorities concurred that adding more stimulus could
undermine the ability of the central bank to meet the inflation target while further widening the
external current account deficit. They shared the mission’s view on the need to start withdrawing
the stimulus next year, while noting that this could be challenging given that 2013 is an election

year. The team also pointed to the importance of protecting fiscal buffers built during recent
years, and indicated that were activity to turn out significantly weaker than anticipated, the first
line of defense should be monetary policy. Staff stressed that the permanent large increase in
public sector wages this year would crowd out needed capital spending, thus hindering a better
allocation of scarce budgetary resources.
21.

There is room to improve financial sector monitoring and for greater use of macro-

prudential tools. There are currently important information gaps regarding the extent of
currency mismatches by borrowers, adequate loan classification by sector and maturity, and
developments in real estate markets. Staff welcomed plans to address some of these weaknesses
(e.g., credit classification) while noting that it is essential to take steps to fill such gaps as soon as
feasible. At the same time, while imperfect, available information in some of these areas should
be used to limit financial institutions’ risks and further strengthening buffers. The mission
recommended moving forward with plans to adopt higher provisioning for foreign-currency
loans, and encouraged the authorities to evaluate the use of other similar measures such as
higher capital requirements for such lending. The mission also supported authorities’ plans for
introducing dynamic provisioning.
22.

The exchange rate does not seem to be fundamentally misaligned (Box 3). The

mission’s estimates based on CGER and measures of external competitiveness suggest that the
guaraní was overvalued by less than 10 percent at end-2011. All the methodologies used point
consistently to an overvaluation of around that magnitude.

B. Improving the Tax System
23.

Paraguay needs to raise its tax ratio to

support upgrading basic infrastructure,

30

improving social indicators, and reducing

25

poverty. While tax revenues have been growing at a

20

solid pace in recent years, the tax ratio remains one

15

of the lowest in Latin America, and is well below that
in neighboring countries. Insufficient public
resources are a major factor behind important

time, modest social spending contributes to a relatively low level of human development and
high poverty incidence.11 Higher social and education-related spending could help progress in
these areas while also being beneficial to long-run economic growth. Against this backdrop, and
building on recent TA advice, the mission supported existing tax reform plans and made
recommendations to increase the revenue effort while improving tax equity.
24.

Staff supported the authorities’ efforts to implement the personal income tax (PIT).

The PIT was originally approved in 2004 but its implementation has been postponed several
times by congress. Implementation prospects in the short run have greatly improved after
congress’s lower house approved the tax’s enactment in early May. The senate is expected to
consider the bill soon, and a favorable outcome is anticipated. There was agreement that, while
the current PIT law has several shortcomings, it is important to implement it as soon as possible.
A PIT will not only increase revenues and tax equity—although marginally in the short-run—but
will also contribute to reducing informality. The authorities also agreed that, going forward, it
would be important to work on enhancing the PIT to bolster its income-tax features by limiting
overly generous deductions.
25.

Staff also supported improving agricultural taxation. Despite accounting for over

20 percent of GDP, the agricultural sector’s share of tax revenues is negligible. The mission
supported recent changes to agricultural taxation, including limiting VAT credits against the
agricultural income tax (IMAGRO) liabilities and broadening the IMAGRO base. Staff welcomed
legislation plans to, inter alia, bring cooperatives under the IMAGRO and limit overly generous
deductions. Staff highlighted that there is scope for further trimming of deductions, closing
loopholes, and unifying the various taxation regimes in place in the sector. It cautioned against
the introduction of export taxes (a bill sponsored by individual lawmakers is currently in
congress, with slim chances of approval); instead, it recommended adopting a sales tax on
agricultural products to be levied at the first stage in the transaction chain and at a low rate.
26.

There is scope to increase financial sector taxation. The financial sector is considered

to be under-taxed, owing to exemptions and a low VAT rate (5 percent, compared to the
10 percent general rate). Building on recent TA advice, the mission recommended progressively
raising (one percentage point per year) the VAT on financial transactions to the general rate level.
11

Paraguay ranked 107 out of 197 in the UN’s 2011 Human Development Index. Poverty affected 35 percent of
the population in 2010.

It also suggested bringing the cooperative sector under the corporate income tax, and
eliminating exemptions on interest and capital gains on stocks and public debt holdings. The
authorities agreed with these recommendations.

C. Long-Term Growth and Other Structural Issues
27.

There is room to raise long-term growth. Paraguay’s potential growth is estimated at

about 4½ percent, which is broadly in line with regional levels. However, Paraguay’s per capita
income is considerably lower than that of its neighbors, which suggests scope for higher
potential growth rates. This would require raising the investment ratio (on the low side by
regional levels) and increasing competitiveness
and productivity. The mission identified some key

20000
18000

constraints to growth in the country related to

16000

infrastructure shortcomings, relatively low levels of

12000

human capital, a weak business climate, and labor

8000

market inefficiencies (Box 4). Staff encouraged the

4000

authorities to work on a strategy for easing these
constraints. It also supported ongoing efforts to

improve public enterprise monitoring and performance (including through the enactment of
appropriate legislation); if sustained, they should increase overall efficiency and help ease
constraints to long-run growth.12
28.

The authorities are planning pension system reforms. The current public pension

system comprises a variety of pay-as-you-go, defined-benefit schemes, each governed by a
separate law and with some intended for specific occupations. They cover less than 20 percent of
the working-age population. Although the aggregate system generates a small cash surplus, due
to parametric differences, several pension regimes have sizable cash flow deficits that have to be
covered by the central government. Reliable data on the system’s liabilities and assets lacks
comprehensiveness, partly due to weak reporting requirements. The mission stressed the need
for a proper actuarial assessment of the existent pension schemes. It also welcomed plans to
address other shortcomings, including through homogenizing and strengthening the system’s
regulation and supervision, for which the authorities plan to create a superintendency of

There are 9 state-owned enterprises in Paraguay, including in water services, telecommunications, cement, oil

pensions with World Bank support. The authorities’ plans also include a broader reform to pursue
a modern and encompassing pensions system based on sustainability and portability principles.
The project also aims at reducing contingent liabilities.
29.

Financial sector reform is advancing in some areas in line with recent FSAP

recommendations (Box 5). Staff supported advances on the program to strengthen regulation
and supervision of cooperatives, and to create a financial safety net for the sector. Little progress
has been made in other areas in the sector, however, notably on governance reform. The mission
welcomed plans for implementing a new payments system later this year. It also supported
ongoing discussions to set up a high-level committee to strengthen cooperation and
coordination among regulators. The authorities explained that plans to reform bank and BCP
legislation will likely move more slowly as they require strong support in congress, where the
current administration lacks a majority. These reforms would facilitate updating bank prudential
requirements and support a more effective risk-based supervision, including by bringing the
definition of capital and loan classification fully in line with international standards.
30.

The BCP continues moving forward with the process of adopting an inflation-

targeting (IT) regime (Box 6). In 2011 the authorities announced their intention to adopt IT,
envisaging that the process would be completed before end-2013. The mission welcomed steps
taken by the BCP to support this process, including adopting a 14-day rate as the policy rate,
producing a bi-annual inflation report, and improving communications. The mission encouraged
the BCP to continue moving forward with the implementation of recommendations made by a
recent MCM technical assistance missions in the areas of monetary framework and operations,
liquidity management and forecasting, and FX operations. The team also reiterated its
recommendation to recapitalize the central bank by implementing the 2010 recapitalization
law.13

STAFF APPRAISAL
31.

A severe drought will lead to a contraction in 2012, but the economy is expected to

rebound strongly next year. GDP is projected to fall by 1½ percent this year, driven by the
agricultural sector. Although domestic demand growth has receded from high levels in 2011, it

13

Concerns about the financial cost to the Treasury appear to have been a key factor in the delay of the
recapitalization of the BCP.

16

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

PARAGUAY

2012 ARTICLE IV REPORT

should remain robust, in line with strong confidence. With the drought now over and supportive
policies in place, growth will likely resume in the second quarter and accelerate in the second half
of the year. The non-agricultural sector should grow at close to potential, although the output
gap would remain negative. As weather conditions normalize and agriculture recovers, GDP
would expand by 8½ percent in 2013.
32.

The current policy mix seems broadly appropriate for 2012. The monetary policy

stance is stimulative, with a policy rate below its neutral level underpinning robust credit growth.
Fiscal policy is providing strong stimulus to activity, with an impulse of over 3 percent of nonagricultural GDP. This policy mix is broadly consistent with meeting the BCP inflation target (5
percent) in 2012 and will help offset the impact of the drought on the non-agricultural sector.
However, staff considers that this year’s permanent large increase in public wages precludes a
better allocation of scarce budgetary resources as it would crowd out needed public sector
investment. Regarding exchange rate policy, heavy FX intervention in 2012Q1 appears to have
prevented the guaraní from depreciating, which would have also helped cushion the effects of
the drought.
33.

It is important not to relax policies further, and stand ready to tighten if

inflationary pressures resurface. With non-agricultural GDP close to its potential, further
monetary and fiscal stimuli will likely fuel inflationary pressures and widen the external current
account deficit. At the same time, were clear signs of weaker-than-anticipated non-agricultural
growth to appear, monetary policy should be the first line of defense. Going forward, with the
expected reversal of the recent decline in meat prices once the export ban is lifted, and given the
strong recovery anticipated, inflationary pressures are likely to rise as 2013 approaches. The BCP
should stand ready to tighten monetary policy in a timely manner while allowing for sufficient
exchange rate flexibility. Fiscal policy would also need to play a role by starting to withdraw the
significant stimulus provided in 2012.
34.

Staff encourages closing important information gaps in the financial sector.

Improving information on currency mismatches, loan classification, and real estate prices is
essential to enhance financial sector monitoring. At the same time, while imperfect, available
information should be used to limit financial sector risk. In this regard, staff encourages the
authorities to implement plans to adopt higher provisioning for foreign-currency loans. Staff
considers congress’s initiative to abruptly move public sector deposits from commercial banks to

PARAGUAY

a state-owned bank to pose a risk to financial stability; appropriate alternatives should be
considered.
35.

A higher tax ratio would help address significant deficiencies in infrastructure and

social indicators. Paraguay has one of the lowest tax ratios in the region. Higher tax revenues
would help improve basic infrastructure, finance higher levels of social spending and improve
human capital, and support poverty reduction. Staff welcomes the authorities’ efforts to
implement the PIT as soon as possible. Going forward, it would be important to strengthen the
tax by limiting overly generous deductions. Staff also supports improving income taxation in
agriculture, where generous deductions and significant loopholes are major factors behind very
low revenue collections. There is scope to increase the tax contribution of the financial sector,
including by broadening the base and raising the VAT rate on financial transactions, which is only
half the general rate.
36.

Key constraints to long-run growth need to be addressed. Staff considers that, given

Paraguay’s income level, there is room for achieving higher long-run growth. Growth is being
constrained, in particular, by large infrastructure gaps, relatively low levels of human capital, and
a weak business climate. Sectors where public enterprises have a strong presence could also
improve their efficiency. In this regard, staff supports the authorities’ efforts to improve
monitoring and performance of public enterprises, and encourages the authorities to consolidate
recent advances, including by enacting appropriate legislation.
37.

Staff welcomes progress on structural financial sector reforms and encourages the

authorities to move forward with the reform agenda. The program to bolster regulation and
supervision, and to set up a safety net for cooperatives is advancing. Its full implementation will
strengthen the sector and the overall financial system. Staff supports the forthcoming
implementation of a new payments system, and encourages the authorities to set up promptly a
high-level committee of regulators. It is important that reforms to banking and BCP legislation
are implemented as soon as feasible to support a more effective risked-based supervision and
bring prudential regulations fully in line with international standards. Finally, staff supports plans
to reform the pension system, including by strengthening its regulation and supervision.
38.

The authorities’ efforts to support IT implementation are welcome but further work

would be needed to transition to a full-fledged regime. The BCP has recently taken several
important steps to support this process, including the establishment of a single monetary policy

18

rate and the publication of bi-annual monetary policy reports. Further advances in several areas,
including the monetary framework, and monetary and FX operations, would also be required for
the BCP to transition to full-fledged IT. Moving to average reserve requirements would help
reduce excess liquidity and foster the interbank market, improving the monetary transmission
mechanism. Implementing the BCP recapitalization would also be important to further
strengthen monetary policy. Improved communication and coordination between the BCP and
the Ministry of Finance would also facilitate liquidity management and forecasting.
39.

It is recommended that the next Article IV consultation takes place on the standard 12-

month cycle.

Box 1. The Natural Real Interest Rate in Paraguay
The natural real interest rate (NRIR) can be used as a benchmark to evaluate the stance of
monetary policy. The assessment involves a comparison with the real policy rate. If the economy is in
full-employment and absent any financial friction, the NRIR should equal the growth rate of potential
output and clear the savings-investment equilibrium. In practice, being a latent variable, the NRIR has
to be estimated through various methods and might differ from potential growth. This Box presents
two alternative measures of the NRIR for Paraguay based on economic theory: one derived from a
consumption-smoothing model with a risk-free real rate, and a second one based on the uncovered
interest rate parity (UIP) condition.
A parameterized consumption model with a risk-free rate suggests a NRIR for Paraguay of
around 3¾ percent. In this model, which in the version considered incorporates habit persistence, the
NRIR is a linear function of the expected long-run growth rate of output, its volatility, and some
measure of risk aversion.1 As is standard in the literature, discount factors between 0.97 and 0.99 and
coefficients of relative risk aversion in the 1.0–2.0 range are

the domestic interest rate should equal the international
interest rate plus/minus the expected rate of
depreciation/appreciation of the domestic currency and any country and/or exchange rate risk.2 The
exercise estimates Paraguay’s NRIR for different expected rates of appreciation. This is based on the
consideration that a country like Paraguay should normally experience productivity growth and
become richer. It is assumed that productivity in the tradable sector relative to the non-tradable sector
grows at a similar pace in Paraguay compared to the rest of the word. Based on this, a long-run real
appreciation between zero and one percent per annum is considered. For this range of values, the
NRIR is estimated to lie between 2.5 and 3.5 percent, with an average of 3.0 percent.

Box 2. Exchange Rate Flexibility in Paraguay
FX flows exert pressures on the exchange rate. Policymakers may choose to let the exchange rate move freely with FX
flows, or may decide to resist such pressures by intervening in the FX market and changing the level of net international
reserves. The extent to which these pressures are resisted determines the degree of flexibility of an exchange rate regime.
In a purely flexible regime, the exchange rate carries the entire burden of the adjustment, with no intervention by the
authorities and no change in reserves. In a purely fixed exchange rate regime, on the contrary, the exchange does not
change, as reserve accumulation absorbs FX flows. In practice, however, most exchange rate arrangements are somewhat
between these two extremes. Exchange rate flexibility can enhance monetary policy transmission and help the economy
absorb shocks.
To gauge systematically exchange rate pressures and the degree of resistance to them by the BCP, two indicators
are built: (i) an index of exchange market pressures (EMP), and (ii) a resistance index (RI). The latter is an indicator of
exchange rate flexibility. The EMP index is a combination of changes in the exchange rate and changes in net
international reserves, normalized by each variable’s standard deviation:

to be passed-through to the exchange rate:

The BCP has tended to resist exchange market pressures in recent years. This resistance grew during most of 2007–08
in the face of strong and rising appreciation pressures. Somewhat lower resistance during late-2010 and part of 2011, a
period of appreciation as well, appear to have helped contain inflation. Resistance then started to increase again in 2012Q1
as appreciation pressure rose. Especially since late 2011, the BCP has resisted almost entirely exchange market pressures
against a backdrop of negative supply shocks (drought and foot-and-mouth disease) that might have required a
weakening of the guaraní. Overall, measured by the RI, exchange rate flexibility decreased in Paraguay over the last year,
reversing a trend that had started in late 2009.

Box 3. Exchange Rate Assessment in Paraguay
According to CGER estimates, the guaraní was overvalued by about 9 percent at end-2011. The
guaraní appreciated by 14 percent in real effective terms during 2011, reflecting both a moderate
nominal strengthening and an inflation rate exceeding that of Paraguay’s trading partners. This was
only partially offset by improvements in medium-term fundamentals, notably the current account
deficit, the net foreign asset position, and the terms of trade.
Other methods suggest a similar degree of overvaluation. Staff also assessed the level of the
guaraní using two additional indicators of external competitiveness, namely relative prices and market
shares for Paraguay’s primary products in major export markets.1 Changes in market shares are
measured through the evolution of the substitution ratio of Paraguayan vs. domestic products sold in
export markets. These indicators are compared with their respective medium-term levels. The
methodology indicates that the guaraní was overvalued by over 9 percent at end-2011. The correlation
between these two measures of external competitiveness considered was found to be high (77 percent). This makes sense, given that Paraguay’s exports are easily-substitutable commodities,
with a high sensitivity of demand to changes in relative prices.

Box 4. Constraints to Long-Term Growth
Long-rung growth prospects in Paraguay would improve by easing constraints in some key areas:



Investment and basic infrastructure. Investment is low by regional standards (below 19 percent of
GDP). In particular, there are large deficiencies in basic infrastructure (e.g., ports, river transport,
utilities, roads), which increase production costs and constitute a drag on growth. Public-private
partnerships could be used as a vehicle to support infrastructure improvements, while carefully
assessing the fiscal contingencies related to them. At the same time, moving forward with reforms

Human capital development. Studies show that
the marginal return to education in Paraguay is
among the highest in Latin America.1 This
reflects largely the relative scarcity of human
capital in the country. Indicators of schooling are
low compared with its neighbors. In addition to
helping raise productivity, improving human
capital by raising schooling could help attract
higher volumes of (and higher value-added) FDI
flows while reducing inequality and poverty.

Labor markets. Paraguay ranks low by international standards in its labor market institutions, which
increases production costs and hurts competitiveness. Based on World Bank data, labor market
features that account for Paraguay’s low international ranking include: (i) a high ratio of minimum
wage to the average value added per worker, (ii) significant barriers to hiring and firing employees,
and (iii) substantial rigidity of hours. To put these issues in perspective, the minimum wage in
Paraguay is about ½ of average value added, versus a Latin American average of 32 percent. Days
of paid annual leave—30 after 10 years of service—are about one third higher than the regional
norm. Moreover, notice periods on redundancy dismissal (some 7½ salary weeks) are more than
twice the regional average.

Paraguay: Real Sector Developments

Following a record-high level in 2010, growth decelerated strongly in 2011, on the back of monetary tightening and
domestic supply shocks. Domestic demand remained robust, but also decelerated. Declining food prices and lower demand
growth reduced inflation.
Growth slowed down markedly in 2011…

…falling well below average growth in the region.



A slow recovery of the global
economy might adversely affect
commodity prices.



A large increase in U.S. interest rates
or a strong deceleration in the
Chinese economy could induce a
moderation in demand-driven global
price increases.



Staff assessment: Low to medium

The external current account would worsen and
strong pressures on the exchange rate could
arise.

If accompanied by a large decline in soy
production (about 50 percent of agriculture),
lower prices will drag down growth, including via
spillovers to the non-agro economy.

The financial sector might observe an increase in
NPLs, which would be large only to the extent
that the shock is sufficiently persistent.

Fiscal and monetary policies could help sustain
domestic demand.
Staff assessment: Medium to large





The probability of a much weaker
external demand than currently
envisaged seems to range from low
to medium.



Effects similar to a collapse in the world price for
soy (see above).
A large and broad based decline in external
demand would affect primarily the agricultural
sector but would impact also the rest of the
economy both directly and indirectly.

Domestic

agriculture to
rest of the

currently
estimated

Staff assessment: Low to medium





Persistent
intense droughts
(extended over
two years)

Staff assessment: Low

Staff assessment: Medium to large





If spillovers to the non-agricultural
sector are stronger than currently
estimated, domestic demand would
decelerate more strongly than
currently anticipated. This would
result in lower non-agricultural
growth, which would impact the
financial sector and the fiscal
accounts more strongly.

The probability of two consecutive
intense droughts is low. However,
were they to materialize, economic
activity would experience a more
prolonged decline, which would also
amplify the shock.





Lower domestic demand and non-agricultural
growth would hurt employment and incomes.
Given weaker buffers in the non-agricultural
sector, NPLs would be higher than in the
baseline. Similarly, tax revenue growth would be
negatively affected.

A more prolonged economic contraction would
impact the financial sector more strongly—
including indirectly through spillovers to the rest
of the economy—increasing NPLs.
Lower export earnings could put the guarani
under strong pressure and lead to a large
depreciation, which could generate sizeable
balance sheet effects and inflationary pressures.
Strong buffers at various levels (by the BCP,
farmers, and banks) would help deal with

Relative Likelihood of realization in the
next 1-3 years
(high, medium, or low)

Expected impact on economy if risk is realized
(high, medium, or low)
depreciation pressures and potential financial
sector stress from higher NPLs and balance sheet
effects. However, some individual bank buffers
might become strained.

Further fiscal
relaxation

Higher inflation

Staff assessment: Medium

Staff assessment: Medium



Congress tends to use its powers to
increase spending without proper
funding, and there are political
pressures to make the current stance
of fiscal policy more expansionary.





Going forward, congress could limit
the ability of the Ministry of Finance
to control spending through the
Financial Plan.

Staff assessment: Medium

While fiscal buffers are strong, a larger fiscal
expansion would make it harder for the BCP to
meet the inflation target.

It would widen further the current account deficit,
and could put pressure on the guaraní. In
addition to fueling inflation, this could produce
balance sheet effects, with negative implications
for the financial system.

A weakening of the fiscal framework could have
long-lasting consequences for fiscal discipline
and the public finances, rising debt and eroding
current buffers.

It could also limit the space for implementing
needed infrastructure expenditures to bolster
potential growth.
Staff assessment: Low







Pressures to relax macroeconomic
policies could increase ahead of the
elections. With relatively weakly
anchored inflation expectations and a
still developing inflation targeting
regime, inflation could increase above
the central bank’s target.



While a setback, inflation will likely remain on the
low side (single digits).
However, anchoring inflation expectations and
establishing strong central bank inflation
credentials would take longer than currently
envisaged.

A high openness to trade and strong
pass-through implies a potentially
significant price impact from
exchange rate depreciation.

The RAM shows relatively low probability events that could materially alter the baseline path, which is the
scenario most likely to materialize in the view of the staff. Staff’s subjective assessment of the relative likelihood
among those low probability events as noted in the matrix (ranging from “low” to “high”) is consistent across
different country reports prepared in a given period.

Safeguards Assessment: Under the Fund's safeguards assessment policy, Central Bank of

Paraguay (BCP) was subject to a full safeguard assessment in respect to the arrangement approved
on May 31, 2006. A safeguards assessment of the BCP was completed in October 2006. The report
stated that while the BCP has made some progress in strengthening the safeguards framework since
the 2003 safeguards assessment, vulnerabilities remain in certain areas such as financial reporting
and program data reporting to the Fund.

ANNEX 2. WORLD BANK-FUND COLLABORATION
1.

Meeting of teams. The Fund and Bank Paraguay teams met in September 2011 and April

2012 to exchange views on economic developments in Paraguay, and discuss ongoing work and
work plans for the year ahead. This Annex provides a summary of the discussions.
2.

The teams agreed that Paraguay’s main macroeconomic challenge will be responding

appropriately to the supply shocks buffeting the economy. Given the nature of these shocks (an
outbread of foot and mouth disease and a drought), there are limits to what macroeconomic
policies can do to cushion their effects on economic activity. Policies can do little to mitigate the
direct effect of supply shocks on agriculture, and should react only to the extent that there are
spillovers to the rest of the economy, and provided that the inflation remains under control. Against
this background, the current policy mix seems appropriate to sustain activity in the non-agro sector,
which would grow by over 4 percent in 2012. Domestic demand is projected to decelerate, but
would remain robust, helped by a significant relaxation of fiscal policy and stimulative monetary
conditions. However, given the severity of the recent drought and its strong impact on agricultural
activity (projected to fall by 25 percent), the economy would contract by 1½ percent in 2012. Aided
by subdued local food and global commodity prices, inflation is projected at around 5 percent (the
authorities’ target).
3.

Policies need to be geared toward maintaining macroeconomic and financial stability.

Policies need to focus on keeping inflation in line with the official target and the external current
account deficit under control, while protecting financial stability. With the non-agricultural sector
operating at close to capacity, there is virtually no space to relax macroeconomic policies further.
Exchange rate flexibility to allow some depreciation of the guaraní should help to absorb the effects
of the supply shocks. Risks to the financial sector from the contraction of agriculture look limited as
farmers have large buffers from very high profits in recent years. Banks, in turn, have relatively
strong capital and loss-related reserve cushions, and should be able to deal with a moderate rise in
NPLs. At the same time, the recent moderation of credit growth has reduced the risk of a credit
bubble. However, it would be important to keep credit growth under control while continuing to
strengthen financial sector regulation and supervision.

6

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

PARAGUAY

4.

2012 ARTICLE IV REPORT—INFORMATIONAL ANNEX

The following reform areas have been identified as “macrocritical”:


Tax reform. Tax reforms are needed to increase low revenues. In particular, it is
important to implement the personal income tax and reform agribusiness taxation,
while there is also scope to raise taxation on the financial sector. Continuing with
recent improvements in tax administration would also help raise revenues.



Fiscal framework. Paraguay would benefit from further strengthening its fiscal
framework, including through improved public financial management.



Financial system. Further progress on reform to banking legislation would help
strengthening regulation and supervision, as well as bringing prudential norms fully in
line with international standards. It is also important to fully implement the program to
strengthen regulation and supervision for cooperatives and establish a safety net for
the sector.



Monetary framework. To support the move to an inflation targeting regime, the central
bank (BCP) would need to continue strengthening the monetary framework, as well as
FX and monetary operations.

5.

The division of labor between the teams would be along the following lines:


Tax reform. The Fund would continue providing technical assistance (TA) to support
authorities’ efforts to improve the tax system.



Fiscal framework. The Fund would continue providing TA to strengthen public financial
management.



Monetary framework. The Fund could continue providing TA to further strengthen the
monetary framework and operations to support to BCP’s efforts to transition to an
inflation targeting regime.



Money Laundering. The Fund will provide TA on the development of a national strategy
concerning anti-money laundering and combating the financing of terrorism
(AML/CFT).



Medium-term debt management. The Bank, with the Fund’s support (MCM), will
continue providing technical assistance to develop a medium-term debt strategy so as
to reduce domestic debt servicing costs and promote the development of a domestic
government debt market



Transfers. The Bank will study the effects of royalty transfers on municipalities.

ANNEX 3. STATISTICAL ISSUES
Data provision to the Fund has some shortcomings, but is broadly adequate for surveillance.
Following a data ROSC mission in January–February 2006, the authorities’ response to the report
and the mission’s recommendations were published on the Fund’s website on June 30, 2006. The
country is a GDDS participant.

A. Real Sector
1.

National accounts estimates, broadly consistent with the guidelines of the 1993 SNA,
were released in 2005. However, no comprehensive regular program for data collection
through economic censuses and surveys exists (an industrial survey was conducted in 2002, and
an economic census is currently being undertaken) and source data for nonfinancial services,
household consumption, and changes in inventories are insufficient. Major areas of concern
include: (i) the 1994 reference year needs to be updated; (ii) excessive use is made of fixed
coefficients for value added and household consumption; (iii) changes in inventories are
obtained residually; (iv) informal activities are not monitored; and (v) supply and use tables have
been compiled only until 1997. While the periodicity of annual GDP meets GDDS
recommendations, timeliness does not because data are disseminated with a lag of 9 months.
Several STA missions on the compilation of quarterly national accounts (QNA) were fielded in
August 2007, August 2008, November 2009 and March-April 2011. Production of definite QNA
series would need to await a revision of the national accounts base year and the compilation of
supporting basic data, which are tentatively scheduled for 2013, to be completed within 3 years.
The STA mission of November 2009 assisted the authorities in outlining a work program for
updating the national accounts’ base year.

2.

Both the consumer (CPI) and producer price indices (PPI) are reported on a regular
and timely basis. Since January 2008, the Central Bank of Paraguay (BCP) has been using a new
CPI index based on the 2005–06 household budget survey. The geographic coverage of the CPI
is limited to Greater Asunción (the capital and metropolitan area) and expenditure weights are
representative of the consumption patterns of urban households. The PPI has a base weight
period of December 1995 and its basket (150 items) is not fully representative of current
national output; electricity, water, and gas are not covered.

3.

Since the introduction of a regular household survey in 1998, the coverage and quality
of employment and unemployment statistics have improved significantly. Since 2010, data
are released on a quarterly basis, although the latter covers the Asuncion area only. The last

10

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

PARAGUAY

2012 ARTICLE IV REPORT—INFORMATIONAL ANNEX

available observation for the quarterly series is the first quarter 0f 2012, whereas the annual data
for 2011 has not been released yet.Wage indices are updated twice a year.
4.

The data ROSC mission found that the resources are insufficient for real sector
statistics and constrain further development, particularly the full adoption of the 1993
SNA. The authorities have been trying to address these resource shortcomings in the context of
the recent compilation of a new CPI and the production of provisional QNA series.

B. Fiscal Sector
5.

The Government finance statistics (GFS) used for internal purposes and for reporting
to WHD is broadly consistent with the recommendations of the Manual on Government
Finance Statistics 1986 (GFSM 1986). The authorities have not yet prepared a plan to migrate
to the Government Finance Statistics Manual 2001 (GFSM 2001). Monthly data are available for
the central administration (budgetary central government). The asset position of the social
security system is available on a daily basis. Statistics on the central administration include data
of the Postal Service Directorate (a nonfinancial public corporation) and the statistics of the
nonfinancial public sector include data of financial public corporations ––four employer social
insurance schemes. These social insurance schemes are treated as financial corporations in the
monetary and financial accounts. Data on medium- and long-term external debt are reliable and
available on a monthly basis. Domestic debt data are available on request, but need to be fully
integrated with the external debt database. Deficiencies remain in recording short-term supplier
and commercial credit of the public sector. Moreover, there is a discrepancy in the fiscal data
reported by the monetary and fiscal authorities. Measures are being taken to make reporting
more transparent.

6.

Annual data covering general government for 2009 have been reported for
publication in the 2010 edition of the GFS Yearbook. However, since 1994 no outstanding
debt data and no breakdowns for expenditure by function have been provided for publication in
the GFS Yearbook. Monthly and quarterly data are not reported for publication in IFS.

C. Money and Banking Sectors
7.

Paraguay completed the establishment of a unified compilation and reporting system
for the whole range of monetary data. This new system intends to harmonize monetary data
for use within the BCP, for reporting to STA for publication in IFS, and for operational and
monitoring purposes. A revision of the classification criteria has led also to a marked reduction
in the discrepancies of interbank positions. Data on credit cooperatives, which account for

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

11

2012 ARTICLE IV REPORT—INFORMATIONAL ANNEX

PARAGUAY

around ¼ of deposits and loans of the banking sector, are reported to the BCP on a monthly
basis since January 2011. The BCP, with assistance from STA, plans to include monthly data of
the 20 largest credit cooperatives in the monetary survey during 2012. The Superintendency of
Banks publishes a detailed and informative report on the soundness of the financial system.

D. External Sector
8.

The classification of the balance of payments and the international investment
position (IIP) follows the recommendations of the Balance of Payments Manual, 5th
edition. Quarterly and annual data on balance of payments and the IIP are available from 2001
onwards on the central bank website, and are reported only once a year to STA for publication
in the IFS. Improvements have been made in the quality of the data on capital flows, especially
in the coverage of foreign direct investment, and in the recording of external debt transactions.
Special studies by the central bank have improved the estimation methods for remittances of
Paraguayans abroad and unregistered trade transactions, but serious deficiencies remain.

9.

Also, there are deficiencies in the area of private capital outflows, which are difficult to
register due to Paraguay’s open capital account. An STA mission on Balance of Payments
Statistics assisted the BCP in November 2006 in implementing recommendations of the ROSC
mission. In particular, the mission focused on: (1) assessing the surveys used to capture data on
services, direct investment, nonfinancial private sector portfolio investment, and other
investment; (2) reviewing and updating the statistical techniques used to calculate unrecorded
trade; (3) reassessing the treatment of the binational hydroelectric energy enterprises in the
external sector accounts; and (4) reviewing and preparing a preliminary template for reporting
data on international reserves and foreign currency liquidity.

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2012 Article IV Consultation with
Paraguay
On June 22, 2012, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded the Article
IV consultation with Paraguay.1
Background
GDP growth slowed down markedly in 2011 and turned negative in 2012Q1. After a strong rebound in
2010, growth decelerated to 3.8 percent in 2011, reflecting both monetary tightening to contain
inflationary pressures and country-specific supply shocks (cement shortages and an outbreak of foot-andmouth disease followed by a beef export ban). A severe drought hit the country in late 2011-early 2012
causing large losses in the agricultural sector, especially for key export products (e.g., soybeans).
Inflation has declined below the central bank target, but core inflation has remained relatively high. After
peaking in early 2011 (over 10 percent y/y), inflation began easing in the second half of 2011, reaching 5
percent (the central bank’s target) at year-end, and falling further to
3¼ percent in April 2012. This decline reflects mainly lower food inflation due to reductions in meat
prices following the export ban, although tighter monetary conditions and a substantial appreciation of the
guaraní also played a role in 2011. Despite a negative output gap, core inflation remained above the midpoint of the official target range, reflecting still strong domestic demand growth and one-off factors. On
the back of monetary tightening, credit growth moderated to 19 percent in April 2012 (43 percent at end2010). Growth of credit in U.S. dollars decelerated faster, though from a higher base, reflecting problems
in the primary sector and reduced FX earnings. Against this background, domestic demand growth
moderated and financial sector risks diminished.
The BCP began cutting interest rates in late 2011. It reduced the policy rate by 200 bps between
November 2011 and February on the grounds of softening of inflation and risks from an uncertain global
1

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with members,
usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial information, and discusses
with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On return to headquarters, the staff prepares
a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the
Managing Director, as Chairman of the Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this
summary is transmitted to the country's authorities. An explanation of any qualifiers used in summings up can
be found here: http://www.imf.org/external/np/sec/misc/qualifiers.htm.

economic outlook, and by an additional 25 bps in May (to 6¼ percent), citing weakening domestic
demand growth. The real policy rate, at around 1¼ percent, remains below its neutral level, which seems
broadly consistent with the current negative output gap.
The current account deficit improved and international reserves continued to grow in 2011. The external
current account deficit declined to 1¼ percent of GDP in 2011 (from 3½ percent of GDP in 2010) owing
to better terms of trade, a stronger services account, and higher worker remittances. Strong capital inflows
allowed the BCP to increase net international reserves by 1½ percent of GDP in 2011 (to 24 percent of
GDP). Aiming at limiting excessive exchange rate volatility, the BCP continued to intervene on both
sides of the market during 2011 and 2012.
Fiscal policy was slightly expansionary in 2011. The overall fiscal surplus declined by ½ percentage
points to 1 percent of GDP, driven by a large increase in primary spending (especially capital
expenditures). This implied a fiscal impulse (measured by the change in the structural primary balance) of
¾ percent of non-agricultural GDP. Revenue growth decelerated but remained strong, supported by
continued improvements in tax administration. Public debt continued on a declining trend, with general
government debt falling below 14 percent of GDP, one of the lowest in the region.
The banking sector has remained sound. Profitability is high and capital adequacy ratios remain strong.
NPLs are low (2 percent in March), but have risen over the last year. More stringent provisioning
measures and higher capital requirements became effective in January 2012, helping strengthen financial
institutions’ buffers, while a program to bolster the prudential and regulatory framework of the
cooperative sector is being implemented. Congress recently approved legislation to shift public sector
deposits from commercial banks to a state-owned bank, which would pose a risk to financial stability.
The initiative is on hold as the BCP has filed a suit with the Supreme Court challenging the legislation on
constitutional grounds.
Real GDP is projected to decrease by 1½ percent in 2012. The strong contraction in the agricultural sector
will be partially offset by a close-to-potential expansion in the non-agricultural sector. The latter, in turn
will grow on the back of a strong fiscal impulse (3¼ percent of non-agricultural GDP), easy monetary
conditions, and strong confidence. Lower agricultural exports will drive a widening of the external
current account (to over 3 percent of GDP). Strong expenditure growth and a contracting GDP will result
in an overall fiscal deficit of 2½ percent of GDP.
Executive Board Assessment
Directors noted that the Paraguayan economy is projected to contract this year as a result of a severe
drought. However, a rapid turnaround in activity and strong growth next year are expected, on account of
robust domestic demand, strong confidence, and normalization of weather conditions.
Directors agreed that the current mix of macroeconomic policies is appropriately supportive of economic
activity and consistent with the inflation target in 2012. Noting that the non-agricultural sector is
operating at close to capacity, Directors stressed the importance of not relaxing macroeconomic policies
further. In light of the strong recovery expected for 2013, they also recommended that the authorities

3
stand ready to tighten monetary policy if warranted, allow the exchange rate to adjust flexibly, and start
withdrawing fiscal stimulus next year.
Directors commended the authorities for their fiscal prudence over the years. They supported plans to
mobilize tax revenue for infrastructure and social spending. The priorities are to expedite the
implementation of the personal income tax and limit exemptions, and further strengthen agricultural
taxation and tax administration. Directors also saw scope for broadening the financial sector’s tax base
and increasing its low VAT rate. Directors stressed the need to improve the allocation of scarce budgetary
resources. Noting that the large increase in public sector wages will crowd out needed public investment,
they called on the authorities to contain current expenditure growth.
Directors welcomed steps toward adopting an inflation targeting regime. They encouraged further efforts
to enhance liquidity management and to strengthen the monetary framework and operations, including
through the recapitalization of the central bank, and improved communication and coordination between
the central bank and the Ministry of Finance.
Directors commended the authorities for the progress in implementing the 2010 FSAP recommendations
and upgrading the AML/CFT framework. They emphasized the importance of addressing information
gaps to improve financial sector monitoring, and recommended making greater use of macro-prudential
tools. Further steps would also be needed to improve banking legislation, set up a high-level committee of
regulators, and strengthen regulation and supervision for cooperatives. Directors expressed concern about
legislation to abruptly shift to a state-owned bank sizeable public sector deposits kept at commercial
banks. They noted that the measure has been put on hold and called on the authorities to consider
appropriate alternatives to avoid adverse effects on the funding and liquidity of commercial banks.
Directors called for efforts to raise Paraguay’s growth potential and living standards. They encouraged
the authorities to formulate a long-term strategy for improving infrastructure, human capital, and overall
economic efficiency. Directors welcomed ongoing efforts to enhance the monitoring and performance of
state-owned enterprises.

Public Information Notices (PINs) form part of the IMF's efforts to promote transparency of the IMF's
views and analysis of economic developments and policies. With the consent of the country
(or countries) concerned, PINs are issued after Executive Board discussions of Article IV consultations
with member countries, of its surveillance of developments at the regional level, of post-program
monitoring, and of ex post assessments of member countries with longer-term program engagements.
PINs are also issued after Executive Board discussions of general policy matters, unless otherwise
decided by the Executive Board in a particular case.
