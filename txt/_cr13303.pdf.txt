STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2013 ARTICLE IV CONSULTATION
July 19, 2013

KEY ISSUES
Context: South Africa has made impressive strides in economic development over the
past two decades. But in recent years, lower growth has exacerbated high
unemployment, inequality, and vulnerabilities. Although weak trading partner growth
contributed, domestic factors were an important reason why South Africa’s growth has
been below that of other emerging markets. Large current account and fiscal deficits, so
far easily financed by global liquidity, have raised vulnerabilities.
Outlook and Risks: The outlook is for continued sluggish growth and elevated current
account deficits, reflecting global developments and important domestic factors. Absent
structural reforms, growth will be insufficient to reduce unacceptably high
unemployment. Risks are tilted firmly to the downside, especially from lower capital
inflows, though stronger implementation of National Development Plan (NDP) would
improve the outlook.
Structural Reforms: Advancing structural reforms—by implementing the NDP and
increasing competition and flexibility in labor and product markets—is imperative to
achieve faster growth and job creation. Prompt progress on NDP implementation could
build reform momentum and reduce policy uncertainty. Limited reform progress leads to
an inexorable buildup of vulnerabilities.
Demand-Management Policies can only play a limited role in supporting growth.
Automatic stabilizers should be allowed to play this year if growth is lower than assumed
in the budget, but should growth continue to disappoint, offsetting measures will be
required. Greater clarity on a medium-term debt benchmark could bolster credibility.
Measures to improve spending efficiency and composition are critical for growth. The
monetary policy stance is finely balanced and the inflation targeting framework remains
appropriate. Rand flexibility has helped South Africa absorb shocks, and higher reserves
would also help manage vulnerabilities.
Financial Stability: Financial soundness indicators remains strong, though rising risks
from unsecured lending and high household indebtedness suggest additional macroprudential and consumer protection measures, as well as improved regulator
coordination, may be warranted. The adoption of Basel III will further strengthen the
financial architecture, but meeting the net stable funding ratio will be challenging.

Inequality within races has also increased since 1994.
3.
In recent years, South Africa’s subdued growth has exacerbated unaddressed
structural problems and exposed new vulnerabilities. Since the global financial crisis, South
Africa’s growth has lagged other emerging markets (EMs) and commodity exporters, aggravating
its long-standing high unemployment.1 Further, though public and external debt remains
manageable, after five years of elevated fiscal deficits, fiscal vulnerabilities have increased and
the current account deficit has widened. Abundant global liquidity has provided easy financing
so far, but the pull back of capital flows from EMs in May 2013 showed how South Africa’s
domestic vulnerabilities amplify external shocks.

These challenges came to a head in 2012. Dissatisfied with wages and working
conditions many workers in the mining sector have changed union membership, leading to interunion rivalries. In August 2012, a strike turned into a tragedy when over 40 people were killed at
the Marikana mine, owned by the world’s third-largest platinum producer. Tense industrial
relations, especially in the mining sector, persist in 2013, as initial wage demands do not reflect
the outlook for growth and commodity prices, or productivity growth. However, a framework
agreement to normalize industrial relations in the mining sector and address historical challenges
such as spatial patterns, migrant labor, and vulnerabilities brought about by volatility in
commodity prices, has been signed. Inequality and unemployment, combined with localized
expression of discontent with corruption and poor public service delivery are affecting investor
perceptions and macroeconomic outcomes. Since September 2012, citing the lackluster growth,
rising vulnerabilities, and structural and social problems, all three major credit rating agencies
have downgraded South Africa’s sovereign rating—two maintain a negative outlook.
5.
Recent statements suggest a renewed commitment to structural reform, but past
implementation dampens expectations. The African National Congress’ (ANC’s) and the
government’s endorsement of the National Development Plan (NDP) in 2012 raised hopes for
structural reforms. Since then the government has reprioritized spending in line with the NDP
within the fiscal envelope. However, parts of the tripartite alliance have opposed the NDP, which
together with the implementation record of structural reforms leaves many investors skeptical
about prospects for major structural change. At the same time, the political debate over the
direction of economic policy has resulted in policy uncertainty. Also, various factors (including
apparent population dissatisfaction) are contributing to the emergence of other political
formations seeking to contest the 2014 elections.
6.
The authorities’ macroeconomic policies and past Fund advice have been broadly
aligned, but progress on structural reforms has been limited. In the 2013 budget, fiscal
expenditure growth was lowered. Monetary policy has continued to anchor inflation
expectations. In the face of a depreciating currency, the authorities chose not to increase
reserves. As for structural reforms, the 2013 budget takes the NDP as its starting point, and the
Department of Performance Monitoring and Evaluation has started to develop a medium-term
strategic framework that will guide NDP implementation over the next five years. On product
market reforms, the Competition Commission’s powers have been strengthened. Industrial
relations remain tense, and progress on labor market reforms has been elusive.

entrepreneurship during apartheid have left a
legacy that continues to hinder employment and small and medium enterprise (SME)
development. Burdensome regulations, and to a lesser extent access to finance, are also factors
that explain why barriers to entry are high and the creation and survival rates of SMEs in South
Africa are among the lowest in the world.2 Finally, a World Bank study on the economy of townships

finds that crime is an important deterrent to economic activity. The result is a large number of

people excluded from the labor market, increasing capital intensity, too few SMEs, and stifled
innovation and competitiveness.
10.
Meager employment growth has highlighted unaddressed structural problems.
Employment grew an average of 0.8 percent annually in 2010–12 compared to 1.6 percent in
2002–08, leading to an increase in the unemployment rate from a trough of 21 percent to
25 percent. All net job creation post 2009 has taken place in the public sector, while the private
sector has only recovered two-thirds of the jobs lost during the global financial crisis. With
inflation at 5½–6 percent and wage settlements averaging 10 percent since 2008, the gap
between real wages and productivity growth has widened. Wage demands so far in 2013 exceed
inflation by large amounts.

C. Vulnerabilities on the Rise, though Balance Sheets Remain Robust
External position
11.
Despite subdued growth and still-robust terms of trade, South Africa’s current
account deficit in 2012 was one of the largest among EMs.


After averaging 3½ percent of GDP in the previous three years, the current account deficit
deteriorated to 6.3 percent of GDP in 2012, reflecting a wider trade deficit and a 2 percent
fall in the terms of trade (Figure 4). Savings fell while investment was broadly constant. Export
volumes stagnated despite a re-orientation away from Europe and towards
Sub-Saharan Africa and Asia. Import volumes grew rapidly, partly owing to the high import
intensity of infrastructure projects. In the first quarter of 2013, the current account deficit
improved marginally to 5.8 percent of GDP.



South Africa’s current account deficit reflects competitiveness problems, which remain
significant despite the recent depreciation and have contributed to a declining share of
global exports (Box 1). Before 2008, improving terms of trade masked weak export
performance—had the terms of trade remained at the 2005 level, the 2012 current account
deficit would have reached 11 percent of GDP. The share of manufacturing exports has fallen
to just below 40 percent from above 50 percent in 2002, while commodities account for
almost all the rest.



The IMF external balance assessment suggests that South Africa’s current account deficit
exceeded the current account deficit consistent with fundamentals and policies at desired
levels by 2–4 percentage points of GDP (Annex III). Applying mechanically trade elasticities,
this would imply a 10–15 percent exchange rate overvaluation. Although the rand
depreciation since the first quarter of 2013 should help reduce the current account gap,

structural factors, such as low household savings, will likely keep the external position weaker
than justified by fundamentals.
12.
External vulnerabilities are exacerbated by a worsening funding mix and relatively
low reserves.


South Africa’s current account deficit is increasingly financed by non-FDI flows, particularly
debt. Net portfolio and other investment liabilities accounted for 5.1 percent of GDP in 2012,
boosted especially by inflows into the bond market and short-term bank loans. Outward FDI,
notably to Sub-Saharan Africa, is rising, while inward FDI has declined in sync with
deteriorating investor confidence. Nonresidents hold 34 percent of the shares of the top 100
listed firms and about 36 percent of local government bonds (from 13 percent in 2008) are
now held by nonresidents, though at 32 percent of GDP external debt remains moderate.4, 5
The international investment position (IIP) improved in 2011 to -7 percent of GDP from 18 percent of GDP in 2010, as the rand depreciated.



Reserves (US$47 billion at end-June) are at the low end of the IMF’s adequacy metric, and
cover about five months of imports and about 80 percent of the gross external financing
requirement.

Fiscal position
13.


South Africa’s relative fiscal position among EMs has weakened.
General government deficits have averaged 5 percent of GDP for the past four years as South
Africa took advantage of the fiscal space that existed pre-2008 to support the economy. As a
result, government debt increased by 15 percentage points to 42 percent of GDP, slightly
above the median in EM peers (Figure 5).

Nonresidents hold 42 percent of total government debt and 36 percent of local currency government
bonds. Nonresident holdings of equities were estimated by a study conducted by the Johannesburg Stock
Exchange (2012).

More disaggregated data on the nature of other investment flows would be helpful in refining the
external vulnerability assessment.

Rising deficits have more than doubled the government’s gross financing need compared to
2008, which at 12 percent of GDP is above the EM average notwithstanding an average debt
tenor of 11 years. Nearly 60 percent of the 2012/13 borrowing requirement was financed by
nonresidents, which had led to a substantial yield compression before the recent sell-off.

2002



2001

A cyclical decline in revenues has played a role, but most of the deficit deterioration since
2007/08 is due to a near-doubling of the wage bill which now absorbs more than 35 percent
of spending, compared to an average 22 percent among EM peers. This reduces expenditure
flexibility and crowds out government capital spending which is increasingly undertaken by
public enterprises. Public enterprise borrowing has more than quadrupled to 14 percent of
GDP since 2007/08, raising contingent liabilities.

The debt-stabilizing primary balance is estimated to increase to -0.6 percent of GDP in the medium term
as global interest rates normalize.

the 2007 Credit Act, combined with the
objective to promote financial inclusion, led to a sharp rise in unsecured lending. While the
increase in unsecured credit to low-income households from 1.6 to 2.2 percent of disposable
income since 2008 has contributed to greater financial inclusion, there is still a need to improve
access to finance, especially for SMEs, according to the World Bank.7 Rising credit has worsened
household debt burdens, which now amounts to 76 percent of disposable income, and has
added to social vulnerabilities. Higher interest rates, weaker household incomes growth, or lower
house prices could pressure households’ debt repayments, nonperforming loans (NPLs), and
banks’ capital given relatively low provisioning in international comparisons. Banks’ reliance on
short-term wholesale funding provided mostly by residents also represents a vulnerability,
though historically it has been stable as it corresponds to corporate deposits and contractual
savings in pensions and insurance funds that are subject to capital controls. In addition, South
African banking groups’ expansion on the African continent would require additional efforts to
improve home-host cooperation among regulatory authorities.

OUTLOOK AND RISKS
15.
The outlook is for subdued growth with the current account deficit remaining high.
South Africa’s growth is projected at 2.0 percent in 2013, reflecting softer private consumption
growth and sluggish private investment, offsetting robust public investment and higher exports.
Softer disposable income growth, weaker confidence, and households’ high indebtedness hold
back private consumption. Private investment is expected to remain lackluster, due to low
business confidence and perceived high policy uncertainty, electricity constraints, and softer
terms of trade. Growth is projected to rebound to 2.9 percent in 2014 and strengthen to about
3½ percent in the outer years, benefiting from the expected pick-up in global growth and new
infrastructure projects relieving bottlenecks and catalyzing private investment and exports. The
output gap remains slightly negative in 2018 with the IMF staff’s current estimate of potential

growth at about 3 percent, which is subject to considerable uncertainty. Unemployment remains
high throughout the projection period. The terms of trade are projected to fall by 7 percent over
2013–2014 and stabilize thereafter. The current account deficit is projected to be about 6 percent
of GDP in 2013 and in 2014, and to fall only slightly in the outer years, as public investment
remains high.
16.
Quicker implementation of structural reforms could deliver better outcomes, while
lack of progress would build up vulnerabilities inexorably. Although difficult to quantify,
numerous studies suggest tangible and considerable progress on structural reforms would boost
growth and employment over the medium term, and through increased investor confidence have
also a short-run impact. In particular, research suggests product market reform in South Africa
could boost potential growth by 1.2–1.5 percentage points—more if combined with reforms to
transport and communication and to raise the supply of skilled labor—and increase employment
by nearly 40 percent.8 Research on EU and OECD countries also suggests comprehensive labor
and product market reform can provide a significant boost to the economy.9 Without structural
reforms, the resulting low growth and anemic job creation would lead to increased economic
vulnerabilities and could contribute to heightened social tensions.
17.
In the face of these vulnerabilities, downside risks weigh heavily on South Africa’s
outlook (Box 3). A prolonged stop in capital inflows, which could force a disorderly adjustment
of the twin deficits and cause a recession, is the main risk. Continued and substantial global
repricing of risk or term premia is the most likely external trigger linked to the unwinding of
advanced economies’ unconventional monetary policies; escalating industrial tensions are the
most likely domestic triggers. Even a scenario with a stronger U.S. recovery that leads to a sharp
rise in long-term U.S. yields would have negative spillovers on South Africa as it trades heavily
with Europe, while its financial conditions are linked to those in the United States: events in
global financial markets since May 2013 illustrate the potential for a sharp increase in financing
costs. Also, gold prices could fall further with declining demand for safe haven assets. With
limited space for countercyclical policies, lower global growth with roots in Europe or persistent
weaker growth in China and other major EMs, which could reduce commodity prices
considerably, would lower South Africa’s exports and growth, with its impact significantly larger if
combined with a financial shock. Further delays in the coming on line of new power plants are
also a downside risk.

Regional Economic Outlook for Sub-Saharan Africa suggests that once global growth is taken
into account, South Africa’s economy has only a limited impact on the rest of the region’s
growth—caution, however, is called for on the size of spillovers, given data paucity and quality
and varying estimates across studies.10 South Africa’s impact on neighboring countries is
stronger. The pegs to the rand entail importing monetary and exchange rate policy from South
Africa and the Southern African Customs Union revenue sharing mechanism implies significant
fiscal linkages. Considerable people and financial flows also create important spillovers. Weaker
growth in South Africa could lower exports from, and remittances to, neighboring countries. But
higher outward FDI as South African firms seek alternative markets and South Africa’s elevated
current account deficit and resulting high customs transfers should partly offset the negative
impact.
Authorities’ views
19.
The authorities broadly agree with staff on the macroeconomic outlook. Following
the weakness of first quarter GDP growth, they expect that higher growth is required over the
remaining period in order for growth to average the 2.7 percent projected in the 2013 budget.
Weakness of the first quarter GDP growth data is partly attributed to temporary factors. They
also emphasize that the slowdown in Europe and China has further constrained external demand
and adversely affected South Africa’s terms of trade. Despite its declining share as an export
destination, Europe’s economic situation remains critical for South Africa, notably for
manufacturing and agriculture exports. Nevertheless, the authorities recognize that domestic
factors are contributing to sluggish growth and an elevated current account deficit.
20.
The authorities concur on the key risks, but highlight South Africa’s resilience in
previous episodes of capital outflows. A slowdown or sudden stop in capital inflows would
likely lead to sharp rand depreciation, which may warrant higher interest rates should the risk of
a material and sustained breach of the inflation target become evident. The depreciation is
expected to contribute to some narrowing of the current account deficit. The authorities note
that in earlier sudden stops episodes, South Africa did not face dollar shortages. Nevertheless,
higher funding costs and lower GDP would require some fiscal adjustment. Such an event would
complicate macroeconomic dynamics, but would be manageable. Anticipation of the end of
unconventional monetary policy in the United States has already resulted in a slowdown in
capital inflows, currency depreciation, and higher sovereign yields across EMs. In addition, the
authorities view the risk of lower commodity prices as elevated and the risk of a deeper
slowdown in Europe as high compared to the April 2013 WEO.

POLICIES
Against this lackluster outlook and reduced policy space, South Africa needs to move to a higher
and more labor intensive growth path, which will require tackling the key constraints that are
holding back the economy, attacking entrenched interests, while also addressing rising
vulnerabilities.

A. Demand Management Policies: Supporting Growth while Managing
Vulnerabilities
Monetary and exchange rate policy
21.
As the SARB noted in the last monetary policy committee statement, monetary
policy is in a bind, facing low growth, rand depreciation, and increased inflation
uncertainty. The SARB has kept rates on hold since July 2012. Citing subdued core inflation and
a persistently negative output gap, it concluded that underlying inflation remains contained even
though headline inflation is likely to exceed the upper end of the 3–6 percent band temporarily
in the next few months. The SARB assessed that the impact of the depreciation would be offset
by softer world food and oil prices, but that risks to the inflation outlook remain on the upside,
mainly due to uncertainty surrounding the exchange rate and wage settlements. Inflation
expectations remain well anchored, close to the upper end of the target band.11
22.
A simple Taylor rule helps illustrate the monetary policy tradeoff going forward.
With staff’s current end-year forecasts for the output gap (about -1½ percent) and inflation
(5.7 percent), such a rule suggests that the repo rate could be cut modestly. But if inflation rises
in line with the historical exchange rate pass-through (15 percent), the Taylor rule suggests an
increase in the policy rate.12 Further, the tapering of unconventional monetary policy in the
United States creates uncertainty about the neutral policy rate, which has been correlated across
countries. Moderate space for an interest rate cut could open up if the exchange rate passthrough proves to be low and wage settlements are not excessive. But, a rate increase may
become needed if inflation risks become likely to materialize or in the event of a sustained stop
in capital inflows. Moreover, in the event of additional demand shocks, monetary policy could be
eased. The SARB’s communications will continue to play a crucial role in guiding inflation
expectations.
23.
The SARB’s policy has resulted in one of the most flexible exchange rates among
EMs, helping South Africa adjust to shocks. Foreign exchange risk on domestic balance sheets
is limited, which is a key strength. Also, when the rand depreciates, nonresident investors who
11

Klein, N. (2012), “Estimating the Implicit Inflation Target of the SARB,” IMF Working Paper No. 12/177,
finds that the SARB’s implicit inflation target is in the upper segment of the band and has increased in
recent years.

and Services,” forthcoming in the Journal of Development Studies.

SOUTH AFRICA

mainly hold rand-denominated securities share the foreign exchange risk, reducing the dollar
value of outflows. Similarly, the international investment position improves with currency
depreciation. Finally, limits on the foreign exchange exposure of domestic institutional investors
can also have a stabilizing role, as depreciation may require them to repatriate assets.
24.
Higher reserves would enhance the SARB’s ability to provide FX liquidity in case of
disorderly market conditions. Higher reserves would lower the country’s risk premium, partly
compensating for carry costs. Recent financial crisis episodes showed that, regardless of the
exchange rate regime, EMs that held higher reserves suffered lower consumption volatility. The
SARB has seldom intervened in the foreign exchange market and when it has in the past, it has
done so opportunistically. Other countries, such as Israel, Mexico, and Turkey, have built reserves
through regular and pre-announced auctions to buy small amounts of FX, which minimize the
impact on the exchange rate. This could also be useful for South Africa.
25.
The South African authorities have appropriately relied primarily on
macroeconomic policies to manage volatile capital flows. In case of outflows, exchange rate
depreciation remains the key adjustment mechanism, accompanied by targeted FX liquidity
provision in case of dollar shortages and a tightening of macroeconomic policies in case of
financing difficulties. Should large inflows return, the initial policy response should rely on
reserve accumulation, and to the extent possible, looser monetary policy. If a surge in capital
inflows or disruptive capital outflows were to raise macroeconomic or financial system stability
risks, then capital flow management measures could be appropriate in certain circumstances, but
should not substitute for warranted macroeconomic adjustment.13 Outflow liberalization needs to
continue to be mindful of the implications for the stability of banks’ funding.
26.
Measures to boost saving and FDI would lower external vulnerabilities. South
Africa’s saving rate is low relative to EMs, mainly due to low households’ saving (Box 4). The
planned fiscal consolidation will help raise saving, but historical patterns suggest it will likely be
partly offset by lower corporate saving. Tax measures introduced in the 2013 budget to promote
savings are welcome. Incentives for people who do not pay taxes should also be strengthened.
The proposed pension reforms, including compulsory preservation, are worth pursuing. Reducing
unemployment remains key to boost household income and saving. This would create a virtuous
cycle of higher investment, growth, and saving. As the country is likely to remain dependent on
foreign saving over the medium term, FDI should be encouraged to provide more stable external
funding. Besides measures to improve the investment climate, a one-stop shop for foreign
investors that speeds up approvals combined with greater coordination among government
agencies would increase South Africa’s attractiveness as an investment destination and a gateway
to Africa.

Authorities’ views
27.
Noting the high uncertainty on the inflation outlook, the SARB is ready to move
interest rates in either direction consistent with its flexible inflation targeting framework.
While the wider negative output gap might suggest room for policy easing, rand depreciation
and high wage demands add to inflationary pressures that limit the room for any further policy
accommodation. The size of the exchange rate pass-through and the impact of policy interest
rates on economic activity are particularly uncertain at this juncture, although the current
economic conditions suggest a somewhat weaker exchange rate pass-through than has been the
case during previous episodes of rand weakness. The SARB notes that if the exchange rate passthrough proves to be low and wage settlements are moderate, space for a cut could open up. On
the other hand, a tighter monetary policy stance may become necessary if there is evidence of
significant second-round effects on inflation and an unhinging of inflation expectations. Finally,
the SARB has expressed the view that there are limits to the role monetary policy can play in
stimulating economic activity and maintains the inflation targets remain appropriate, while
stressing that structural reforms are needed to put South Africa on a higher growth trajectory.
28.
South Africa remains fully committed to its flexible exchange rate regime. The
exchange rate is a crucial adjustment mechanism and, together with the rand denomination of a
large part of fiscal and external liabilities, an important source of resilience in the South African
economy. Balance sheet exposure to exchange rate risk in banks, public sector, and households is
relatively limited. In the authorities’ view, while some depreciation of the rand was warranted in
terms of the fundamentals, the rand has possibly overshot its appropriate level and is expected
to appreciate to some extent once the global turmoil settles down. However, high exchange rate
volatility, if excessive, could become disruptive and result in disorderly markets and sustained
divergence from equilibrium. Although the authorities do not intend to use capital flow
management measures at present to affect the flows or the exchange rate, they reserve the right
to adopt appropriate policy measures should this become necessary.
29.
The authorities agree that South Africa would benefit from higher reserves and the
modalities of how to achieve this are being worked out. Given the current financial position
of the SARB, the government has borne most of the cost of higher reserves over the past few
years. The authorities also note that the decline in reserves in May was due to repayment of a
maturing Eurobond, and will be replenished once the sovereign issues an international bond
later this year.

allocations and reducing the contingency reserve—to reduce the deficit to 3.1 percent of GDP by
2015/16. While this is consistent with the deficit target in last year’s MTBPS, the consolidation is
more back loaded.
31.
Mainly due to lower growth, the 2013 budget deficit is likely to be higher than
budgeted and debt will continue to rise without offsetting policy adjustments.


Staff projections suggest the 2013/14 deficit will fall marginally to 4.9 percent of GDP.14 This
is 0.3 percentage points higher than envisaged in the 2013 budget and 1.2 percentage points
higher than envisaged in last year’s budget, reflecting the 1½ percentage point downward
revisions to staff’s growth projections for 2013/14 relative to last year’s budget. Relative to
previous years, the margin for error in the budget has been reduced given cuts to the
contingency reserve.



Government debt is projected to stabilize at around 47 percent of GDP in 2018/19,
19 percentage points higher than in 2008. Staff analysis suggests that in the absence of
offsetting measures, even a modest shock to growth and interest rates would result in debt
continuing to rise, with a 10 percent chance that debt will reach 63 percent of GDP by 2020.
In addition, state enterprise debt is expected to continue to increase. Rising deficits have also
raised gross financing needs. These findings are consistent with the public debt sustainability
analysis (DSA) based on the Fund’s new DSA template, which suggests that although South
Africa’s government debt level remains manageable, the relatively high bond spread, large
financing requirements, and significant nonresident bond holdings pose risks.15



Nevertheless, likely high multipliers in the current phase of the cycle and below-potential
growth argue for allowing automatic stabilizers to work this year, while remaining within
existing expenditure ceilings and improving the composition of spending, provided financing
conditions allow.

32.
Staff analysis suggests the authorities should aim to reduce debt to around
40 percent of GDP in the medium term (Box 5). Determining an appropriate debt benchmark
remains highly controversial. Nevertheless, given South Africa’s outlook, the magnitude of
macroeconomic and fiscal shocks, and cross-country comparisons, reducing the debt-to-GDP
ratio to around 40 percent by 2020 would allow the country to rebuild adequate fiscal space.
Announcing such a debt benchmark as a guiding principle for fiscal policy over the medium term
and the measures to buttress it could help bolster the credibility of the fiscal outlook. Finally,
issuing a comprehensive fiscal risk statement, as currently done in several countries including

On a calendar year basis the deficit is projected to remain constant in 2013 due to a sharp deterioration
in tax collection in the second half of the fiscal year as labor unrest in the mining sector negatively affected
both corporate and personal income taxes.

SOUTH AFRICA

Australia, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, and Indonesia, would strengthen the monitoring of fiscal risks,
including from public enterprise borrowing.
33.
Lowering gross debt to 40 percent of GDP will require significant adjustment. The
fiscal path outlined in this year’s budget implies a 1.8 percent of GDP improvement in the
primary balance to –0.4 percent of GDP by 2015/16. The needed additional measures will depend
on how soon the adjustment is implemented, the horizon over which the authorities choose to
meet the debt benchmark, and spending re-orientation and efficiency. For example, if the debt
target is to be reached in 2020, the primary balance would have to average around 0.5 percent of
GDP in the post-Medium Term Expenditure Framework (MTEF) period. However, the increasingly
challenging financing outlook suggests it may be desirable to introduce some additional
measures already during the MTEF-period to demonstrate a tangible improvement in the
structural balance. In addition, as done in the 2013 budget, the government will need to
reconsider revenue and expenditure plans within the MTEF-period, while protecting social
transfers, if the economic environment deteriorates further or if financing conditions deteriorate
sharply. A decline in potential growth, for example, would require measures, but because
potential growth is not directly observable, if growth persistently disappoints, it would be
prudent to adjust fiscal policy gradually. Finally, ongoing reforms to strengthen fiscal
management—complemented by expenditure reviews and systematically taking into account
program performance at all levels of government—could facilitate re-orienting spending toward
investment, encourage spending efficiency, which deliver a more growth-friendly consolidation.
Authorities’ views
34.
The South African authorities remain committed to fiscal consolidation. They
underscore that the budget expenditure figures are now generally regarded as ceilings and fiscal
discipline has broad support. South Africa budget statements have indicated clearly that if risks
to the economic or fiscal outlook materialize, the government’s fiscal program will be revised
where appropriate, and the authorities remain committed to this view.
35.
The authorities are fully committed to long-term fiscal discipline and recognize the
need to rebuild fiscal space to be able to conduct countercyclical fiscal policy. They see
merit in incorporating risk analysis into the budget discussions, as reflected in recent budget
policy statements. They agree that debt should be low enough to have sufficient room to
increase during downturns without destabilizing market expectations and fiscal dynamics. The
authorities will also proceed cautiously with pension reforms and the implementation of the
national health insurance to ensure their affordability and consistency with fiscal sustainability.
The forthcoming long-term fiscal report will highlight the tradeoffs involved in light of the
principles of counter-cyclicality, debt sustainability, and intergenerational fairness.
36.
The government is intent on improving its service delivery and spending efficiency,
as well as carrying out its large infrastructure program, to support sustainable growth. The
government is taking measures to improve accountability in service delivery, strengthen
procurement through its newly established Chief Procurement Office, and is embarking on a
public service reform. Moreover, government departments have been asked to align their

18

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

SOUTH AFRICA

planning and expenditure to meet the objectives of the NDP. Spending efficiency is being
promoted in a number of ways, and the government is aiming at moving toward performance
budgeting, though the authorities underscore that South Africa needs to continue making
significant allocations to critical areas, such as education and health, even when outcomes are
not fully satisfactory. Finally, the authorities view public infrastructure investment, mostly carried
out by public enterprises, as essential for sustained growth.
Financial policies
37.
In response to the rapid growth in unsecured lending, the SARB has urged banks to
apply more stringent loan assessments and make adequate provisions. And while this
appears to have led to some moderation in new lending, unsecured credit is still rising rapidly. At
the same time, the authorities are seeking to limit the use of debt collection via wage
withholding to mitigate the social implications of over-indebtedness.
38.
South Africa remains at the forefront of financial sector regulatory reform globally.
The adoption of Basel III earlier this year, the envisaged implementation of the Twin Peaks
system from 2014, and several financial sector initiatives will further reinforce South Africa’s
already strong financial architecture. Including the National Credit Regulator within the Twin
Peaks System, as recommended by the 2012 FSB peer review, would consolidate regulation and
supervision and market conduct for all financial institutions. The SARB last year introduced a
committed liquidity facility that enables banks to meet the liquidity coverage ratio, and very
limited new style Basel III type of bail-in capital instruments have been issued by local banks to
strengthen banks’ loss absorption capacity and enhance long-term stable funding sources,
though banks would still find it difficult to meet the net stable funding ratio (NSFR) in the form
currently envisaged. A deposit insurance scheme is being developed and the crisis management
framework is being improved.
39.
Consideration could be given to additional measures to manage rising credit risk,
combined with measures to help households deal with high indebtedness. As overall credit
growth at 8.3 percent year on year in May remains modest, monetary tightening would not seem
the appropriate response to rising unsecured lending. Instead, introducing quantitative
affordability criteria (e.g., debt to disposable income ratios) accompanied by consumer
protection measures, and limits on mortgage loan-to-value ratios could be considered. Also, to
prevent households turning to nonbank lenders at higher costs, programs to improve awareness
of the negative impact of over-indebtedness should be bolstered, and ways to assist those in
debt distress reach a debt-work out strengthened. Ensuring accurate and comprehensive
information on household indebtedness remains instrumental and proposals to expunge the
credit history of blacklisted individuals should be resisted as it may lead to an abrupt pull-back of
lending. In addition, greater coordination among regulators ahead of the Twin Peaks
implementation is needed, and the feasibility of extending the perimeter of regulation and
supervision to shadow banking institutions to reduce regulatory arbitrage could also be studied.
Moreover, to help banks meet the NSFR when it becomes operational, measures to encourage
retail deposits, especially low-cost accounts, are worth pursuing.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

19

SOUTH AFRICA

Authorities’ views
40.
The authorities are of the view that unsecured lending does not pose systemic risks
and they continue to improve their understanding of the underlying dynamics in this
market. Acknowledging that, on average, households are overly indebted, the SARB is of the
opinion that banks are managing credit risk well and are well-capitalized. Unsecured lending to
households has helped enhance financial inclusion and it is not desirable to have a sudden stop
in credit provision. The authorities are confident that after the rapid increase in personal loans in
recent years, a soft landing can be achieved. Nevertheless, this episode has highlighted some
weaknesses in market conduct and it is important to strengthen consumer protection and
improve households’ financial literacy. It is also necessary to formalize affordability guidelines.
However, too tight affordability guidelines should also be avoided. The SARB shares concerns
about a credit information amnesty that would eliminate some of the credit history, and which
could induce a sharp reduction in bank lending or higher cost of credit to consumers.

B. Structural Policies
41.
The NDP is a wide-ranging vision for inclusive growth and jobs in South Africa
(Box 6). It lays out a blueprint for eliminating poverty and reducing inequality by 2030 by
creating 11 million jobs on top of the existing 13½ million and increasing labor force
participation, sufficient to reduce the unemployment rate from 25 to 6 percent. The plan
estimates this will require increasing growth to an average of 5½ percent between 2011 and
2030 by rebalancing the economy toward investment and away from consumption and raising
productivity and competitiveness. The plan includes a range of proposals to improve
infrastructure, education, healthcare, as well as public service delivery with a focus on
strengthening governance and fighting corruption.
42.
As the NDP states, “South Africa needs to fix the future, starting today.” The
commitment to align the budget with NDP priorities is a good start, as are initiatives to improve
service delivery and accountability, and progress on key infrastructure projects. In the near term,
the authorities should also focus on a few high-impact reforms, quick wins, to build support for
the plan and demonstrate the government’s effectiveness in implementing structural reforms.
Communication of such quick wins would help persuade investors that South Africa’s
fundamentals are improving and could create positive feedback loops by reducing risk premia
and vulnerabilities. The National Treasury’s proposed youth employment incentive is an example
of a potential quick win: pilots need to start as soon as possible and, if successful, this scheme
should be rolled out nationally. The introduction of e-tolling and clarity on several legislative
initiatives could help assuage concerns about policy uncertainty. The coming on line of the first
units of the new power plants and start of construction of the recently approved manganese
railway corridor will boost investor confidence and ease infrastructure bottlenecks. The
normalization of industrial relations, especially in mining where in early-July Deputy President
Motlanthe oversaw the signing of a framework agreement by all parties—with the notable
exception of the Association of Mineworkers and Construction Union which is now the dominant
union in the platinum industry—that is intended to lay the foundations for a sustainable solution
to the problems afflicting the industry, is critical to boost confidence.
20

43.
Additional reforms to the labor and product markets are needed and would best be
done jointly as part of a social bargain. Limited competition in product and labor markets is
mutually reinforcing and has resulted in high corporate profitability and prices, and
unemployment. A social bargain should include wage restraint in return for industry’s hiring
commitments, measures to enhance product market competition, and improved public
services—in particular, in education and training. Government involvement is critical to ensure
the interests of outsiders—outsiders include people without a job and small firms or potential
entrants—and society at large are reflected. Even such a bargain could start with an initial set of
quick wins that help build trust and, with effective communication, reform momentum. Examples
of social compacts include Ireland, Denmark, the Netherlands, and the U.K.16 The Pact for Mexico
is a recent example, including greater labor market flexibility, legislative changes to boost
competition, and new social protection guarantees (Box 7).
44.
Reforms in product markets would spur competition, lower entry barriers and
prices, and promote innovation.


The Competition Commission has done important work regarding cartels and its new power
to conduct market-level inquiries constitutes progress, but more needs to be done. The
Commission’s ability to deal with abuse of market dominance could be strengthened, for
example by moving to effects-based standards in its inquiries. In addition, firms’ costs for
uncompetitive behavior may need to be raised, and the Commission’s resources
strengthened.17



There is also a need to identify entry barriers and regulatory mechanisms by which
incumbents protect their dominant positions. Given that sectoral characteristics differ
significantly, initially targeting a sector that has extensive linkages across firms, e.g., such as
Information and Communication Technology, would have important positive spillovers and
demonstration effects across the economy.



OECD research suggests aligning South Africa’s onerous product market regulation with
international best practice and relaxing employment protection legislation could increase
productivity.18 In contrast with the NDP’s proposals to cut red tape, the Licensing of
Businesses Bill would likely add to the administrative burden, especially for SMEs.



Trade liberalization would contribute to increased competition and, in the regional context
allow South Africa to maximize benefits from Africa’s growth dynamics. Consideration should
be given to reducing the number of tariff bands, lowering tariffs, and removing tariffs on
imports of raw materials and intermediate inputs.

Reforms to labor markets and steps to address skill mismatch would contribute to
job creation. Limiting the practice of extending collective bargaining outcomes to firms that did
not participate in the bargaining—especially SMEs—would increase wage flexibility and reduce
barriers for entry for SMEs. SMEs have a high potential to create jobs and increase the
constituency for reform, but need a more flexible labor framework, with the transfer system
being responsible for safeguarding a socially agreed minimum living standard. A proposal to
restrict the use of temporary contracts—temporary employment has accounted for a large share
of employment growth in recent years—should be resisted. Significantly, raising education
attainments and greater focus on vocational training are required to address South Africa’s skill
mismatch. Targeted transport subsidies for job seekers, combined with greater competition in
the private transport industry, could help alleviate the problem of spatial dispersion.
46.
Though South Africa’s flexible exchange rate is an advantage, the experience of
peripheral euro area countries holds important lessons for South Africa. Greece, Ireland,
Portugal and Spain’s low productivity growth, large current account deficits, accompanied by
easy foreign financing that masked underlying structural weaknesses are signs that are also
present in South Africa.19 Spain and Ireland’s public debt was below 45 percent of GDP in 2008,
showing that debt dynamics can quickly become perverse when growth slows and risk premia
climb. While contingent liabilities from the financial sector are likely to be significantly smaller
than those of Spain and especially Ireland, South African public enterprises’ borrowing could lead
to the crystallization of contingent liabilities. The lessons are: structural reforms should not be
postponed; expansionary policies can only buy time but not sustained growth; and easy
financing builds up leverage that can move out of line with repayment capacity.
Authorities’ views
47.
Keenly aware of the imperative of structural reforms, the authorities are working
toward implementing the NDP. They note that some progress is being made in several areas,
such as in infrastructure, public service delivery, and accountability. The National Planning
Commission will release the first of a series of five-year plans after the elections in 2014 to
coincide with the Government’s Medium-Term Strategic Framework. The authorities continue to
work toward developing social consensus, which will be critical to managing trade-offs between
policy options as they arise.

STAFF APPRAISAL
48.
Over the last two decades, South Africa has made great strides in economic and
social outcomes, yet unemployment remains unacceptably high. South African institutions
and policy frameworks have delivered macroeconomic stability. Living standards have improved
markedly. But, market dominance in many sectors and rigidities in product and labor markets
have produced an insider-outsider system that creates too few jobs and stifles growth.
49.
In recent years, South Africa’s growth has underperformed and vulnerabilities have
increased considerably. While weak external demand contributed, domestic factors—such as
flagging competitiveness, an environment not conducive to investment, labor unrest, and
infrastructure bottlenecks—played an important role. Elevated fiscal and current account deficits,
combined with greater dependency on external debt to finance them, have heightened
vulnerabilities.
50.
The outlook is for sluggish growth, with considerable downside risks. The
government’s adoption of the NDP as its blueprint for reform is welcome, though progress on
structural reforms is likely to be slow given entrenched opposition. Failure to deliver on structural
reforms makes the economy increasingly vulnerable to shocks. The main risk is a sudden and
prolonged stop in capital inflows, with either domestic or external triggers, such as tighter global
financing conditions. Escalating labor tensions is a key domestic risk. Lower global growth and
commodity prices also weigh on South Africa’s outlook.
51.
A lackluster outlook, both at home and abroad, combined with heightened
vulnerabilities and reduced policy space makes progress on structural reform imperative.
Demand management policies cannot address the root causes of South Africa’s weak growth.
Instead, decisive progress on structural reforms, many of which are identified in the NDP, is
essential to boost inclusive growth and job creation and lower economic and social
vulnerabilities. Quick wins can help build consensus for reform and confidence. Critical product
and labor market reforms could be pursued as part of a social bargain. Trade policy should not
be used as a tool for industrial policy and trade liberalization could help promote competition
and create jobs.
52.
The need to support growth while managing vulnerabilities argues for a gradual
consolidation while bolstering the credibility of the medium-term fiscal outlook. With debt
broadly in line with that of other EMs and weak growth, the government’s commitment to stick
to the expenditure ceiling is welcome, while revenue can be allowed to move with activity this
year. But the authorities should prepare contingency measures that could be implemented
quickly were funding conditions to deteriorate sharply. Continued sluggish growth beyond this
year, however, and the need to stabilize debt will likely require measures. Also, announcing a
debt target that takes into account the significant volatility in the South African economy could
strengthen credibility. Ongoing reforms to boost the efficiency of public spending and
improvements in expenditure composition would help make the consolidation more
growth-friendly.

53.
The current monetary policy stance is appropriate and high inflation uncertainty
warrants caution. The evolution of capital inflows, the corresponding exchange rate passthrough to inflation, and wage settlements will be critical factors in determining the next
monetary policy move. The SARB is rightly ready to move in either direction. In the event of
additional demand shocks, monetary policy should provide most of the stimulus, given
diminished fiscal space. The present inflation targeting regime has anchored inflation
expectations and has provided flexibility to support the economy.
54.
South Africa benefits from having one of the most flexible exchange rate regimes
among EMs and also needs higher reserves. Rand flexibility helps cope with global shocks and
the recent depreciation should help reduce the current account deficit. In addition, increasing
international reserves would enhance the authorities’ ability to supply foreign exchange liquidity
in the event of disorderly market conditions. Opportunistic FX purchases are warranted and
consideration could be given to regular and pre-announced auctions. Measures to boost FDI
would lower external vulnerability, though structural reforms are needed to strengthen South
Africa’s low household saving rate and its external position, which is assessed to be weaker than
justified by fundamentals and desired policies.
55.
South Africa’s financial system is well capitalized and supervised, but risks from
unsecured lending have risen, warranting some measures. Ongoing efforts to improve the
regulatory and supervisory architecture, including through this year’s adoption of Basel III
standards and the planned twin peaks system are welcome. The rapid expansion of unsecured
credit from a low base has contributed to financial inclusion, but has highlighted areas where
new measures could play a useful role to bolster financial stability and help households deal with
high indebtness. The authorities’ watchful monitoring of unsecured lending to ensure that these
risks do not become systemic remains critical and increased coordination among regulators
ahead of the implementation of the twin peaks system is warranted.
56.
Staff recommends that South Africa remain on the standard 12-month Article IV
consultation cycle.

Box 1. South Africa: Analysis of External Competitiveness 1/
Estimates of the real effective exchange rate (REER) based on unit
labor costs are higher than its long-term average, and more
appreciated than CPI-based metrics. The recent nominal depreciation of
the rand has contributed to a 6 percent decline in the CPI-based REER over
the past few months. However, our estimates of the dollar-denominated
relative unit labor costs—a proxy for ULC-based REER—show that, albeit
on a declining path, South Africa’s real exchange rate remains near 10
percent above its 10-year average. A ULC-based REER is likely to be a
better indicator than a CPI-based measure as it captures competitiveness
gaps on labor-intensive sectors that are of strategic concern for South
Africa. Weakening competitiveness is reflected in a falling share of
manufacturing exports to 39 percent in 2012 from 53 percent in 2002,
while commodities now account for nearly 60 percent of exports.
South Africa’s value-added REER (VA-REER) has also appreciated
substantially faster than CPI-based metrics. The VA-REER is based on
relative GDP-deflators and accounts for vertical specialization in trade by
controlling for the import-component of South Africa’s exports . As a large
importer of intermediate goods, the index is of high relevance for the
country. South Africa’s GDP deflator has grown faster than CPI in 10 out of
the past 13 years, signalling a wider competitiveness gap than suggested
by CPI-based metrics. Staff estimates of South Africa’s VA-REER indicate an
appreciaciation of near 35 percent since its 2008 trough, against a more
moderate appreciation of about 26 percent suggested by the CPI-based
REER.
Notwithstanding the diversification of its export markets, South
Africa’s export performance continued to deteriorate in recent years.
With the slowdown in advanced economies, South Africa’s trade has been
reoriented towards emerging and developing economies, with an
increasing share of commodities exports that are usually associated with
lower value-added than manufacturing. Nevertheless, South Africa’s export
performance—measured as the ratio of its export volume growth to its
trading partners’ real domestic demand growth—has been weaker than EM
peers’. South Africa’s export performance index is about 20 percent lower
than in 2005 (on a cumulative basis), in spite of the diversification of its
export markets.

Staff research indicates that commodity-intensive EMs tend to exhibit
weaker export performance than manufacturing exporters. Regression
analysis suggest that the elasticity of export volumes to trading partners
growth is about 0.2 smaller for commodities exporters. Among large EMs,
Brazil, Chile, and South Africa have had weaker export performance than
China, India, and Mexico, even after controlling for the effects of real
effective exchange rate and relative unit labor costs. Put differently, the
higher demand for South Africa’s commodities exports has not been
sufficient to fully offset the impact of subdued manufactured exports. As
the latter is typically associated with higher value-added, this has negative
implications for external competitiveness and growth.

Box 2. South Africa: Credit to Households
South Africa appears at the late stage of the credit
cycle, as a mortgage boom before 2008 was followed
by rapid unsecured lending growth.1 During 2001-2007,
mortgages grew by an annual average of 22 percent.
Mortgage growth slowed substantially after 2008, but
unsecured credit including personal loans has nearly
quadrupled since 2007.

Residential mortgages are subject to rising credit risk
given that interest rates have been at historical lows
and household indebtedness is elevated. Residential
mortgages account for about 36 percent of banks’ total
credit and 56 percent of lending to households. Over
35(50) percent of (new) mortgages have loan-to-value
ratios above 80 percent. After more than tripling in the 2000s,
house price indices have displayed mixed signals. CPI-adjusted
house prices have dropped by 15 percent after 2008. Higher
interest rates, subdued income, and high unemployment could put
pressure on household debt and banks’ asset quality.

The key vulnerability of South Africa’s banking system is credit risk. Household debt to disposable
income ratio increased by nearly 30 percentage points from
2002 to 2009 and has remained elevated at around
76 percent. Benefitting from the currently low interest rate
environment, the debt service to disposable income is still at
a manageable 8 percent. However, as mortgage rates are
linked to the SARB repo rate, a 200 bps increase in interest
rates is estimated to bring this ratio to 10–14 percent, close
to historical highs. SARB’s latest Financial Stability Review
cites tensions in the labor market spreading to other sectors
and higher levels of unemployment as two critical risks for
financial stability, as these would worsen repayment capacity.

lowering the dollar value of outflows. In addition,
domestic nonbank institutional investors have assets exceeding 100 percent of GDP and a relatively low

Protracted period of slower growth in advanced economies. Although trade with Europe has fallen after
the global financial crisis, Europe still accounts for about a fifth of South Africa’s exports. A downside
scenario discussed in the Spring 2013 WEO assumes that euro area growth recovers more slowly and only
up to 1 percent a year by 2018, with GDP ending 4 percent below the WEO baseline. Globally consistent
simulations using DSGE models calibrated to 28 economies suggest the scenario would lead to lower growth
and inflation, and slightly higher twin deficits. The impact on South Africa would be similar to that on the
median EM and smaller than that on the median advanced economy.
Lower commodity prices. Lower commodity prices will hurt South Africa directly and indirectly, e.g.,
through lower demand for manufacturing products from Sub-Saharan Africa. Although mining accounts for
about 8 percent of GDP, supporting activities account for at least an additional 7 percent of GDP, and it
generates about two thirds of exports. Because South Africa’s aging deep-shaft mines have a high cost
structure, lower commodity prices could lead to closures of marginal mines and large job losses creating
hysteresis effects. The lower income would lower aggregate demand and reduce public revenue, leading to
higher twin deficits and higher risk spreads. As a mitigating factor, the currency would depreciate helping
offset the effect of lower commodity prices on earnings.

3½ percent during 1995–2011, and was at 2.8 percent in 2012.
The saving gap with peer EMs has increased over the last decade. While saving in South Africa remained
relatively stable, the median saving rate in EMs rose during the 2000s. This rise in peers’ saving rates mainly
reflects higher government and a stable private saving rate. In contrast, in South Africa, the private saving rate
has been more volatile, falling from 1995 through 2007, rising sharply during the crisis, and falling again since
2011. South Africa’s household saving is the lowest of the seven peer EM countries for which data is available.
In a broader sample of 42 countries of advanced and EM economies, South Africa’s household saving rate
ranks in the low 25 percent of the distribution. Government saving followed trends in peer EMs in the 2000s,

Household saving has moved together with household labor income in percent of GDP.1 The high
structural unemployment and adverse demographics (especially a high young dependency ratio) have been
the main culprits for the low level of household saving, with the decline in the labor share of income and
households’ increasing debt also contributing. Household saving rose modestly after the global financial crisis
as wage settlements remained fairly insensitive to the economic cycle.
Looking forward, the national saving rate might increase, but likely only slowly. It is expected to remain
below the long-term 15.5 percent average given the expected

This box explores the question of an appropriate debt benchmark for South Africa. The ongoing
debate about the tradeoff between growth and fiscal consolidation suggests there is no easy answer to this
question. Moreover, lack of consensus across models and the number of factors driving perceptions about
debt sustainability complicates this analysis. The deterioration in South Africa’s fiscal position has raised
concerns, but its debt is still in line with the average EM, financing has so far been easily available in South
Africa’s liquid bond market, and the debt maturity and currency composition suggest high debt tolerance.
A debt ceiling around 50–60 percent of GDP appears consistent with debt sustainability.
Following IMF (2003), the sustainable debt ceiling can be calculated as the discounted sum of future
primary surpluses.3 Using a discount rate of 0.8—consistent with South Africa’s EMBIG spread in
2000–07 and the average yield on the U.S.

The debt ceiling should also be informed by debt
levels in other EMs. South Africa’s debt in 2008
was low relative to its sovereign rating, but is now
closer to that of similarly-rated countries.

Box 5. South Africa: Debt Benchmarks (concluded)
This debt ceiling and the magnitude of shocks likely to hit the South African economy suggest the
authorities should aim to lower the debt-to-GDP ratio to around 40 percent of GDP.



A government needs to commit to service its debt not only in a baseline scenario, but also when the
economy is buffeted by shocks or when fiscal risks materialize. This means the benchmark should be
sufficiently below the debt ceiling to allow space to absorb shocks that increase the fiscal deficit.



Following Mendoza and Oviedo (2004), a debt benchmark which takes into account the impact of
shocks can be calculated as the discounted sum of future primary surpluses following a temporary
decline in the primary balance. For South Africa, we assume a 3 percentage points of GDP decline in
revenues—roughly equal to the decline during the global financial crisis—that is gradually unwound
over the next 7 years.4 Assuming expenditure moves in line with baseline projections, the sustainable
debt-to-GDP ratio declines to 35-40 percent of GDP for discount rates ranging from 0.8-0.85.



The debt benchmark depends not only on the debt ceiling and the discount rate, but also on the target
horizon and the degree of confidence about the debt path. A shorter horizon would allow a higher debt
benchmark given the buildup of uncertainty over time, but would provide less guidance to investors. On
the other hand, a greater degree of confidence about the debt path would require a lower debt
benchmark, but would tend to reduce risk premia charged by investors.



Stochastic simulations using the simple three-variable VAR suggest reducing the debt-to-GDP ratio to
just below 40 percent of GDP by 2020 would be consistent with keeping debt below a 60 percent of
GDP debt ceiling with a 90 percent degree of confidence. Our simulations suggest this reduction in debt
could be achieved either through a 2 percent of

GDP increase in revenues or a 4 percent per

Revenue increase-cumulative output loss
annum reduction in real spending growth after the



Simulations suggest increasing revenue or
reducing spending growth would result in a
6–9 percentage loss in output by 2020. However, if
structural reforms were implemented that would
raise annual growth from 3 to 5 percent, the
necessary adjustment would be achieved without
further fiscal measures.

Box 6. South Africa’s National Development Plan 1/
The NDP, launched in August 2012 by the National Planning Commission, aims to eliminate poverty
and reduce inequality by 2030. The NDP targets to reduce the number of households living below the
poverty line from 39 percent to zero, and the Gini coefficient from 0.7 in 2009 to 0.6 in 2030. The NDP went
through extensive consultations with different parts of society.
The NDP focuses on a range of policy areas, especially infrastructure, education, health care, social
protection, building a capable state, and promoting accountability and fighting corruption.



Infrastructure. The plan proposes to expand electricity capacity, water supply, public transport, and
transport infrastructure to facilitate commodity exports.



Education and training. Actions include: improving the management of the education system; meritbased school principal selections; improving teachers’ performance with training remuneration
incentives; adult education and a variety of informal training programs.



Health care. The plan aims at improving health management and implementing a national health
insurance system to improve the quality of care and public facilities.



Building a capable state. The NDP aims at enhancing the role of the Public Service Commission to
monitor standards and improve recruitment, and improving relations between national, provincial, and
local governments.



Fighting corruption and enhancing accountability, by giving greater power to the Tender Compliance
Monitoring Office, insulating anti-corruption agencies from political interference, setting up a dedicated
prosecution team, specialist courts and judges, and developing accountability frameworks.

The NDP will be implemented in phases. First, some steps are planned for 2013 to start implementation.
The second phase will involve implementing the 2014–19 Medium Term Strategic Framework, the first fiveyear building block of the NDP. The 2013 budget Review is the first budget tabled within the framework of
the NDP and next year’s budget is expected to require line departments to align their spending with the
NDP priorities.

Box 7. Labor and Product Market Reforms—the Mexico Case
Recently, Mexico has embarked on a series of structural reforms to improve labor and product markets,
done as part of a social compact, known as the Pact for Mexico, signed by the newly elected President and
the main opposition parties. These reforms and their implementation in the context of a social bargain could
be of interest to South Africa as they relate to areas where action is needed and the two countries share
some similarities in initial conditions.
Labor Market Reforms
The Labor Market Reform Law approved in 2012 includes measures to promote labor market
flexibility, increase productivity, and improve labor conditions. 1 The Law introduces temporary trial and
training contracts for project-specific and seasonal activities that are expected to boost youth employment,
and hourly pay contracts to facilitate part-time employment. Other provisions are expected to lower hiring
barriers, including streamlining the settlement of labor lawsuits, limiting compensation for unjustified
dismissals to one-year’s salary, and eliminating the requirement to terminate employment if a worker leaves
the union. The new Law also aims to boost productivity by relaxing seniority rules and including productivity
and labor skills as criteria for promotion, while introducing training certification schemes and a National
Committee for Productivity. Bans on discrimination, child labor, a regulatory framework for outsourcing, and
measures to improve working conditions for mining, rural, and domestic workers, are aimed to improve
labor conditions.
Mexico’s labor reforms are expected to boost job creation, reduce informality, and increase
productivity and growth. The Banco de México and the OECD estimate that these reforms could boost
potential growth by 0.15-0.5 percentage points per year.2 Significant formal job creation is expected. Around
two-thirds of the payoff is anticipated to come from new temporary contracts and the measures to increase
worker productivity.
Product Market Reforms
Recent anti-trust reforms have strengthened the powers of regulatory bodies to curb anticompetitive practices. The 2011 Competition Law authorizes the Competition Commission (CFC) to impose
fines of up to 10 percent of domestic turnover, and carry out on-site searches and impose criminal penalties
if necessary. The Commission’s new powers have already been applied in several cases and are expected to
be a significant deterrent to abuse. The Law also envisages setting up specialized courts with expert judges
for all competition and regulation issues. Once operational, these courts should play an important role in
supporting competition and policing abuses.
The Telecoms Reform Bill—signed into law in June—includes wide-ranging proposals to improve
competition in the telecommunications sector. The Bill establishes a new regulatory body with powers to
apply more stringent regulation to dominant firms in the market and, if necessary, force asset sales. The new
regulations are expected to increase competition, improve access to broadband internet, and reduce the
costs of communication services.
Mexico has also significantly eased procedures to start a business. The time and average cost to open a
business has been brought down, while the capital required to start a business has been progressively
reduced, reaching zero for low-risk businesses this year. Also, the Federal Commission on Regulatory
Improvement is applying a regulatory impact analysis (RIA) to all regulations introduced over the past
decade, and has aligned its RIA systems with OECD best practice.

Annex I. The Job Challenge
South Africa needs to create jobs for its unemployed, those that have altogether withdrawn from the
labor force, and future labor market entrants. In their National Development Plan (NDP), the
authorities aim to create 5 million jobs over the next decade, and 11 million by 2030. To achieve this,
growth enhancing reforms will have to go hand in hand with measures to improve the functioning of
the labor market and to strengthen the country’s education system. This annex summarizes existing
analysis of the factors contributing to the problem of “too few people work,” and policy
recommendations.
1.
South Africa has one of the highest unemployment rates, one of the lowest labor force
participation rates, and exhibits one of the highest income inequality in the world. Since the

registering 50 percent (ILO, 2013). This
is worrying because poor labor market outcomes early in one’s career are typically associated with
lower life time earnings and less stable employment (“scarring”). Unemployment is also highly
concentrated amongst individuals with little formal education and lower skills. In addition, labor
force participation at 55 percent is very low in international comparisons, in particular among
women. The low share of individuals who are gainfully employed is one contributing factor to South
Africa being one of the most unequal societies in the world as measured by the Gini coefficient.
2.
The NDP aims at creating 11 million jobs by 2030. It succinctly summarizes the problem
as “too few people work,” and targets a reduction in the unemployment rate to 6 percent and an
increase in the labor force participation rate to 65 percent by 2030, while the working-age
population continues to grow. This translates into employment growth of 2½ percent per year in
2013–2030, and—assuming that the historical relationship between growth and job creation remains
unchanged—average annual real GDP growth of 5 percent. This compares to estimates of potential
growth of 3 to 3½ percent, and an average annual employment growth of 1 percent over
2001–2012. By way of illustration, if South Africa were to grow by 3 percent per annum through
2030, only 3.2 million jobs would be created and unemployment would remain at 25 percent,

capital intensive methods of production.
Hence, the interaction between growth policies and labor market policies is the key for achieving
South Africa’s employment objectives. In addition, the increasing tendency toward “international
trade in skills” as opposed to trade in goods makes even more imperative to have competitive labor
market policies for an economy to be able to generate jobs (IMF, 2013).
4.
Cross-country comparisons show how the macroeconomic environment and labor
market institutions contribute to job creation Countries that have achieved high rates of job
creation, such as India, Peru, and Thailand, are characterized by favorable macroeconomic outcomes
(Zhan, 2011). Growth was slightly higher than in countries that generated fewer jobs, inflation was
substantially lower, the REER depreciated or showed less appreciation, and the current account
balance was stronger. In addition, fast job creators tend to have a lower union density, substantially
lower average and minimum wage levels than countries that struggle to create jobs, and less
restrictive working hours. At present, South Africa does not exhibit these characteristics of job
creating economies.
5.
Several characteristics of South Africa’s labor market have restrained job creation:
these are described below:


Skill gap: Current job seekers do not have the skills demanded by employers and the education
system does not provide the majority of graduates with these skills.



Bottleneck labor relations: South Africa’s wage bargaining framework contributes to real wage
outcomes that appear to have little sensitivity to economic conditions, and, in addition, legal
provisions on dismissal, in practice, appear to make employers reluctant to take on new workers.



Wage setting: Real wage growth has outpaced productivity growth, even during the 2008/09
crisis when real GDP fell. Given South Africa’s fairly high costs of living, even for poor
households, workers’ demands for higher wages are understandable. Even more so when
considering that a single income earner often supports eight or more relatives. However, firms
have responded by investing in labor saving capital and have been reluctant to hire. In addition,
the mandatory extension of collective bargaining agreements makes it difficult for smaller firms

50

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

SOUTH AFRICA

to compete on costs while still creating employment (Bhorat & Mayet, 2012). The practice also
makes markets less contestable and contributes to oligopolistic structures that hold back
innovation, growth, and job creation.


Temporary employment: So-called labor brokers have been a main source of private sector job
creation since 1995. Firms turn to labor brokers because, in practice, it appears to be extremely
difficult to dismiss workers for performance reasons. Thus, taking on a new hire when
information on his/her skills and work ethic are difficult to establish is a risky proposition from
which firms shy away. Unions see labor brokers as undermining collective bargaining and
workers’ rights and are calling for them to be abolished: an amendment that would restrict the
use of labor brokers is currently discussed in Parliament. However, this would come at the high
price of even less job creation.



Bottleneck spatial gaps: A legacy of apartheid is that job seekers as well as workers do not live
close to the centers of economic activity. As a result, those employed in low-skilled jobs often
face transport costs that anecdotally can take up to one third of the take-home wage. In
addition, people spend inordinate amounts of time commuting.



HIV and AIDS infections: Although health outcomes have improved in recent years, the
HIV/AIDS adult prevalence rate remains one of the highest in the world, negatively affecting the
labor supply.

Policy recommendations


Youth unemployment: The youth employment incentive, envisaged in the NDP, and currently
under consideration by the government, could be an important trigger to ease the transition of
young people into employment and avoid life-long “scarring” effects.



On-the-job training: For those already in the labor market, on-the-job training is instrumental,
including through the use of temporary employment contracts and trainee wages combined
with training requirements and certification.



Education system: For today’s and future students, making school leaders more accountable
and providing quality teacher training would be important steps to strengthen the education
system. Moreover, infrastructure backlogs need to be addressed, and failures to distribute
learning material as it happened with textbooks in one province during 2012 cannot be
tolerated. Given South Africa’s strong private school system and a very nascent private school
industry targeting low-income households, it may be worth exploring whether a school voucher
scheme could help incentivize education providers.



Wage setting


It is important to stop extending negotiated wages to other firms that were not part of
the bargaining process. While discontinuing this mandatory extension will be politically
challenging, it would open the way to firm-level bargaining and facilitate wage outcomes
that are conducive to employment gains.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

51

SOUTH AFRICA



More generally, unemployed outsiders need to gain a voice in wage bargaining, and
higher labor force participation would reduce the burden on those gainfully employed to
provide for others that do not have a wage income.



A national minimum wage, as currently proposed by Cosatu, could further slow job
creation; the issue of a minimum household income needs to be addressed through
social transfers (CDE, 2013).



Temporary employment: Labor brokers should be encouraged, unless problems with dismissal
practices are addressed in parallel.



Bottleneck spatial gaps: Better public transport, targeted transport subsides, and introducing
more competition in the private mini-bus industry could help lower commuting costs and thus
make low-wage jobs more attractive. It would also facilitate job search by reducing the
transaction costs of going to interviews. It would be useful to pilot these reforms before
applying them nationally.

Annex II. A Synopsis of Product Market Issues in
South Africa
South Africa’s product market has undergone an important transformation in the past two decades. State
control of the economy was reduced and regulation improved. However, the economy still has high levels of
concentration and market dominance in several sectors, relatively restrictive regulation and trade regimes,
and far-reaching industrial policy.

Achievements of the Past two Decades
1.
From a history of extensive state economic involvement and isolation during apartheid,
South Africa has gone through significant liberalization in the past two decades. By signing the
National framework Agreement (NFA) in 1996, all interest groups agreed to restructure the economy and
certain state assets, including transportation and telecommunication. The share of state-owned
companies dropped markedly, several foreign companies now operate in South Africa, and many South
African companies have operations abroad. According to World Economic Forum (2013), South Africa has
well developed financial markets, ranked number 3 out of 144 countries.1 The country also does well on
factor allocation, such as intellectual property protection (20th), property rights (26th), the accountability of
its private institutions (2nd) and its good market efficiency (32rd).
2.
A series of reforms since the 1990s has led to a substantial liberalization of South Africa’s
trade. Effective protection and the anti-export bias fell, with average effective protection for all traded
goods falling from 35 percent in 1994 to 9.5 percent in 2006.2 Particularly strong declines in protection
were experienced in textiles, apparel, footwear, and communication equipment.
3.
South Africa has also developed a sophisticated system of competition regulation. The
competition regime, established under the Competition Act of 1998, is centered on three institutions—
the Competition Commission, the Competition Tribunal, and the Competition Appeal Court. Each of these
institutions is independent of the government. This framework has received positive assessments by the
OECD and others.3

Characteristics of South Africa’s Product Markets
Restrictive product market regulation
4.
Despite these advanced, product market regulation remains relatively restrictive,
particularly in the area of barriers to entrepreneurship and to trade and investment. According to
the OECD, South Africa ranks 35 out of 40 countries in the sample—a higher ranking denotes a more

restrictive system.4 It ranks 40 (out of 40) for license and permits system, regulatory and administrative
opacity, and regulatory barriers to trade and FDI have particularly contributed to the barriers to
entrepreneurship and to trade and investment. In addition, according to a recent survey by Grant
Thornton, regulations and red tape is the second largest constraint for business expansion, with the
manufacturing sector most affected. 5 Problems include the high cost, complexity, and amount of time it
takes to deal with red-tape associated with starting and running a business in South Africa. The proposed
Licensing of Businesses Bill, however, which requires all businesses to obtain a business license from their
local municipality, has raised concerns that it might impose an additional bureaucratic burden on
business, especially SMEs, if passed.

Highly concentrated sectors and market dominance
5.
Various sectors remain highly concentrated. South African companies are relatively profitable
compared with EM peers, and appear particularly so in sectors with high concentration. New entrants,
especially SMEs, often find it difficult to compete with existing firms that have high market dominance,
despite government support for startups. These insider-outsider dynamics have resulted in higher prices
in some sectors to the detriment of consumers or of other companies that use those goods and services
as inputs. For example, some sectors, e.g. telecommunications, transportation, and financial services,
provide important inputs to other industries. Hence, economies with costly and inefficient goods and
services will find their competitiveness in other industries negatively affected. In the case of
telecommunications, despite some deregulation of the telecom market and some price moderation, the
sector still has high prices relatively to other countries and internet services remain inefficient.6 7
Trade policy
6.
Despite past progress, there remains considerable room for further trade reforms. The
current tariff structure remains complex relative to other middle-income economies as measured by the
coefficient of variation and the number of tariff bands.8 Nominal and effective protection rates remain
high for many sectors, particularly those producing final consumer goods. Trade in services remains
relatively protected. In addition, a number of investment incentives have made the tariff structure more
complex, and in some cases are subject to local-content requirements and contingent on export

performance.9 Comprehensive trade liberalization does not appear to be emphasized in the government’s
current policies. In contrast, trade policy seems to be conducted on a case-by-case basis and guided
more by industrial policy objectives.
Industrial policy
7.
Past and ongoing industrial policies have aimed to bring South Africa to a new growth path
and promote industrialization and diversification, but their effectiveness appears elusive. South
Africa’s industrial policy is articulated mainly in its Industrial Policy Action Plans (IPAP).10 The IPAP focuses
on sectors that are deemed to be most productive and envisages a host of interventions at the micro
level, with an emphasis on import substitution. Critics of this approach have highlighted the difficulties of
picking winners, the focus on industry as the only sector that could have high job creation potential, and
the possibility that the implementation of industrial policies could provide space for rent-seeking
behavior. 11

Competition commission
8.
Despite a well-developed system of competition regulation, a focus on improving
implementation and further strengthening effectiveness appears needed. Progress has been made
in the breaking up of cartels. Nevertheless, it is not unusual for cases to take four to five years from
referral by the Commission to the Tribunal hearing being concluded. This follows an investigation period
of one to two years by the Commission. Further, although South Africa has embodied in its legal
provisions specific effects-based tests for dominance abuse, the test is still broadly form-based in
practice. Finally, there is a need to identify entry barriers and regulatory mechanisms by which
incumbents continue to protect their market dominance from outsiders. 12

Annex III. External Balance Assessment
1.
South Africa’s current account deficit reached 6.3 percent of GDP in 2012—the highest
since the global financial crisis. The deficits in the income account (2.2 percent of GDP) and net
transfers (1 percent of GDP) were broadly in line with their 10-year average (2.4 and 0.7 percent of
GDP), reflecting the country’s low domestic savings and substantial net payments to the other
members of the Southern African Customs Union (SACU). 1 The trade deficit, however, was much
larger than its 10-year average of ½ percent of GDP. Higher-than-expected income receipts, terms
of trade gains, and higher exports to other SACU countries contributed to a narrowing of the current
account deficit to 5.8 percent of GDP (in seasonally adjusted terms) in the first quarter of 2013.
2.
The underlying current account deficit was slightly below 6 percent of GDP,
reflecting South Africa’s low domestic savings and high investment needs. The cyclicallyadjusted current account balance as calculated in the IMF External Balance Assessment (EBA), which
adjusts for the economic cycle and the TOT, both for South Africa and its trading partners, was
-5.8 percent of GDP in 2012. A separate methodology, which eliminates cyclical factors, as well as
other temporary factors, such as the recent labor unrest in the mining sector, and assumes that net
transfers to the other members of the SACU and interest rates revert to their historical average,
reaches similar conclusions.
3.
A decomposition of South Africa’s current account suggests that favorable
commodity prices masked the deterioration in export performance. We decompose South
Africa’s trade deficits into six main categories, and show that the deficit on the balance of
manufactured goods—especially machinery,

Gross transfers to the other members of the SACU are denominated in local currency, reducing South Africa’s

4.
Model-based estimates continue to suggest that South Africa’s external position is
weaker than implied by fundamentals and
desirable policies. This analysis is based on the
IMF’s EBA.2 Two of the EBA approaches are
regression-based and entail estimation of the
current account balance and the REER for a panel of
50 countries over a period of 25 years, based on
macroeconomic fundamentals, relative prices,
demographics, and policy variables that can be used
to understand the extent to which the exchange rate
or current account misalignments are related to
policy gaps. The third method—the external
sustainability approach—involves a comparison of
the projected medium-term current account balance
with the one that would stabilize the country’s net
foreign asset position (NFA) to GDP, at a specific
benchmark level against peers’ average.
5.
The macro-balance approach and the external sustainability analysis suggest the
current account deficit is larger than implied by fundamentals and desired policies. The macro
balance estimates yield a gap between the 2012 cyclically adjusted current account and the
estimated current account norm of -2.8
South Africa: Actual and Fitted Real Effective Exchange Rate
percentage points of GDP, but with a large
(in natural logarithm of index, 1990-2013)
confidence interval. The external sustainability
analysis suggests a gap of -4.2 percent of GDP
between the 2012 cyclically adjusted current
account and a benchmark current account that
stabilizes South Africa’s NFA/GDP ratio at peers’
average (2 percent). Combining these two
approaches and taking into consideration the
inherent uncertainty of these methods, staff
deems the current account to be 2–4
percentage points of GDP weaker than implied
by fundamentals and desired policies. Applying

mechanically the estimated trade elasticity of
0.2, and taking into account the REER depreciation during the first four months of 2013, the
overvaluation of the rand was estimated at 10–15 percent in 2012.3 While the recent nominal

depreciation should help close this gap, structurally-low domestic saving coupled with robust public
infrastructure investment are expected to keep the current account deficit elevated over the medium
term. Structural reforms that would help increase household savings are needed to yield a sustained
improvement in the current account balance (Box 4).
6.
EBA estimates of the CPI-based REER imply a small degree of undervaluation, but
these results are highly sensitive to the sample period and not sufficiently reliable. For South
Africa, the EBA REER regression suggests a small degree of undervaluation (about 7 percent) as of
mid-April.4 However, the results are highly sensitive to the sample period: the 1990s was a period of
major structural shifts in the country, including the abolishment of the multiple currency practice
(financial rand). The high volatility of the rand also makes the REER regression results particularly
unstable. Moreover, most of the misalignment is not explained by the included regressors, and is
probably driven by factors outside of the EBA model. The high volatility of South Africa’s REER and
the many structural changes that have taken place in the past 20 years make inferences from this
method unreliable. Finally, several indicators of external competitiveness, including South Africa’s
declining share of world exports and the ULC-based REER, point to an overvaluation (see also Box 1)
7.
In conclusion, South Africa’s external position appears weaker than consistent with
medium-term fundamentals and desirable policy settings. The current account deficit has
widened sharply, financed to a large degree by debt flows. Several indicators point to
competitiveness issues. Though the real depreciation in 2013 should help reduce the gap, structural
factors underlie the large current account deficit, suggesting the external position will likely remain
weak.

The CGER REER regression suggests an undervaluation of 14 percent.

South Africa has consented to its quota increase under the 14th General Review of Quotas which will
essentially double the IMF’s quota resources, once effective. South Africa also accepted the
proposed amendment to reform the Executive Board. The quota increases will become effective
once the proposed amendment to reform the Executive Board entered into force, which occurs once
the Fund certifies that three-fifths of the IMF members (i.e., out of currently 188, i.e., 113 members)
having 85 percent of the total voting power have accepted the proposed amendment.1 South
Africa’s quota under the 14th General Review will increase to SDR 3,051.2 million (R 38.6 billion).
In September 2010 South Africa also agreed to lend the IMF up to SDR 340 million (R 4.3 billion)
under the New Arrangements to Borrow (NAB). The NAB is a set of credit arrangements the IMF has
with 40 member countries and/or its institutions. Currently 37 of these arrangements are active and
thus can be drawn by the IMF to supplement its quota resources for lending purposes. South Africa
is paid interest on its loans to the IMF under the NAB based on the SDR interest rate. As of end-May,
South Africa had lent SDR 41.2 million (R 570.8 million) to the IMF under the NAB.
On January 7, 2013, the South African Treasury pledged $2 billion (R16.8 billion) to IMF resources, as
part of a global drive to increase the IMF’s resources by over US$430 billion to help strengthen
global economic and financial stability. The South African authorities are now working with the Fund
staff to draft a bilateral agreement to this effect.
Exchange rate arrangement
The rand floats against other currencies, and South Africa maintains an exchange system
consistent with South Africa’s obligations under Article VIII of the IMF’s Articles of
Agreement. 2 South Africa’s de jure exchange rate arrangement is free floating, and the de facto
arrangement is floating. Its exchange system is free of multiple currency practices and restrictions on
the making of payments and transfers for current international transactions. South Africa has
continued to gradually liberalize the system of capital controls in place since the apartheid regime.
With the abolition of the financial rand in 1995, all exchange controls on nonresidents were
eliminated. Nonresidents are free to purchase shares, bonds, and other assets and to repatriate
dividends, interest receipts, and current and capital profits, as well as the original investment capital.
Foreign companies, African governments, and institutions may inward list on South Africa’s equity
and debt instruments on South Africa’s securities exchanges.

1

The two additional conditions for the proposed quota increases to become effective have already been met, i.e., the
entry into force of the Voice and Participation Amendment of the Fund’s Articles of Agreement and the consent of
members having not less than 70 percent of the total quotas (as of November 5, 2010) to the increase in their
quotas.

South Africa accepted the Article VIII, Section 2(a), 3, and 4 obligations in 1973.

Box 1. Liberalization of Capital Controls on Residents (Selected Measures)
October 2009—The authorities (i) raised the lifetime limit on individuals investment offshore to R4 million
from R2 million a year and (ii) increased the single discretionary allowance to R750,000 from R500,000.
March 2010—Authorised dealers were allowed to acquire direct and indirect foreign exposure up to a
macroprudential limit of 25 percent of their total liabilities, excluding total shareholder's equity.
October 2010—Authorities (i) eliminated the 10 percent levy on the capital South Africans can transfer upon
emigration, (ii) raised the limit on offshore investments by individuals to R4 million a year from R4 million in
a lifetime, and (iii) raised the single discretionary allowance to R1 million from R750,000.
December 2010—Limits that resident institutional investors can invest offshore were raised by 5 percentage
points, and now range from 25 to 35 percent depending on the type of institutional investor.
January 2011—Authorities allowed qualifying international headquarter companies, subject to approved
registration with the Financial Surveillance Department of the South African Reserve Bank, to raise and
deploy capital offshore without exchange control approval.
October 2011—Authorities (i) removed the restriction on foreign participation in the ownership of money
remittance businesses and the requirement to partner with an existing authorized dealer to conduct money
remittance business; (ii) approved criteria for consideration of individual foreign investments above
R4 million; (iii) announced that all inward-listed shares traded and settled in rand on the Johannesburg Stock
Exchange will be regarded as domestic assets; (iv) permitted South African companies to make bona fide
new outward foreign direct investments, outside their current line of business, allowing them to diversify
their offshore operations from a domestic base; (v) withdrew the prohibition on the transfer of additional
working capital for investments below R500 million per applicant company, per calendar year; (vi) allowed
South African companies to acquire from 10 to 20 percent equity and/or voting rights, whichever is higher,
in a foreign target entity, which may hold investments and/or make loans into any Common Monetary Area
(CMA) country; (vii) allowed residents (natural persons) to transfer up to R1 million abroad, as part of the
single discretionary allowance, for investment purposes, without the requirement to obtain a tax clearance
certificate.
February 2013—South African multinationals were allowed to treat a local subsidiary as a nonresident
company for exchange control purposes to encourage retaining treasury operations in South Africa.
Authorized dealers were also allowed to invest an additional five percent of their total liabilities, excluding
total shareholder’s equity, for expansion into Africa, in addition to the current macro-prudential limit on
foreign exchange of 25 per cent.

Exchange controls on capital transactions by residents have been gradually relaxed. The
authorities’ main objective has been to move toward a system based on prudential limits and
supervision, and away from a rigid system of quantitative controls. Box 1 summarizes recent

measures consistent with the overall liberalization strategy that have helped offset some of the
pressure on the exchange rate coming from strong portfolio flows since 2010.
Article IV consultation
The 2012 Article IV consultation was concluded by the Executive Board on August 1, 2012. South
Africa is on the standard 12-month Article IV consultation cycle.
Technical assistance
An IMF Fiscal Affairs Department (FAD) mission took place in December 2010 to support capacity for
fiscal policy analysis in the Treasury’s Fiscal Policy Unit (FPU). In July 2011, senior FPU staff visited the
IMF’s headquarters to discuss international experience with fiscal rules. In March 2012, an FAD team
visited Pretoria to discuss room for further improvement in South Africa’s strong budget institutions.
In November 2012, an FAD-arranged mission by two external experts visited Pretoria to discuss the
forthcoming Long-term Fiscal Report, and in April 2013, a TA mission visited Cape Town to support
the authorities in the establishment of a new Parliamentary Budget Office (PBO).
In March 2011, an STA mission took place to conduct the training on the Coordinated Direct
Investment Survey for Anglophone Africa in Pretoria.
A number of IMF Legal Department (LEG) missions in 2007–09 assisted the authorities in the
ongoing process of rewriting the Income Tax Act and drafting a new Tax Administration Act. The
most recent LEG mission took place in November 2008, and a report on this mission was completed
in late 2009. LEG has submitted comments on the Tax Administration Act to the authorities by email.

THE JMAP WORLD BANK IMF MATRIX
The IMF South Africa team led by Ms. Laura Papi (mission chief) met with the World Bank South
Africa team led by Mr. Asad Alam (country director) on May 30, 2013, to discuss macrocritical
structural issues and to coordinate the two teams’ work for June 2013–May 2014.
The teams agreed that South Africa’s macroeconomic challenges include promoting job creation
and improving the long-run inclusive growth needed for maintaining social cohesion. In addition,
they noted the increased vulnerabilities, especially external, that pose risks to macroeconomic
stability.
Based on this shared assessment, the IMF and the World Bank agreed to support the authorities’
efforts on the following macrocritical fronts with these specific actions:


Fiscal sustainability: The IMF will continue its engagement with the authorities on South Africa’s
long-term fiscal challenges and risks as part of the surveillance dialogue. For the 2013 Article IV

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND 5

SOUTH AFRICA

consultation, IMF staff have worked on a paper that discusses what might be an appropriate
debt benchmark for South Africa given the magnitude of shocks that the economy is exposed
to. In a similar vein, the debt sustainability analysis has been done according to the new
guidelines, which focus on risk-based analysis. The IMF will provide follow-up advice on the
authorities’ forthcoming Long-Term Fiscal Report and remain supportive of the nascent
Parliamentary Budget Office. The IMF will also provide advice on managing fiscal risks, and
stands ready to share work by FAD on health care reform and seek opportunities, such as
workshops with the authorities, to discuss options for the design of reforms in this area and will
continue to inform the authorities of best practices from other countries in terms of modeling
the implications of health and social security reforms.


Improvements in the composition of public spending: The IMF continues to call for containing
the public sector wage bill and increasing capital spending during the 2013 Article IV
consultation. The World Bank is providing technical assistance for ongoing efforts to strengthen
government-wide monitoring and evaluation systems and is carrying out a public expenditure
tracking survey for health-related spending in the province of Kwa-Zulu Natal.



Debt and foreign exchange management: Partnering with the South African Reserve Bank
(SARB), the World Bank has been supporting efforts in the area of the foreign currency reserves
management (including enhancement of SARB’s governance and risk management frameworks
as well as its investment operations and systems infrastructure), and by supporting the National
Treasury in preparing the debt management strategy, reviewing strategic benchmarks and
improving the secondary debt market architecture. Also, a new partnership with the Public
Investment Corporation (PIC), which manages public assets, will focus on strengthening all
aspects of investment operations and infrastructure



Strengthened public infrastructure: The Eskom Investment Support Project ($3.75 billion IBRD
loan) and the Eskom Renewable Energy Support Project ($250 Clean Technology Fund), both
being implemented by the World Bank, support the expansion of electricity supply and help
South Africa accelerate development of renewable energy generation capacity.



External vulnerabilities: For the 2013 Article IV consultation, the IMF has worked on a paper that
discusses South Africa’s competitiveness challenge in an era of global growth moderation and
on a paper that analyzes the factors behind South Africa’s low saving. The IMF has been asked
by the National Treasury to cooperate on a series of workshops that will examine South Africa’s
external vulnerabilities and seek to achieve broader policy consensus throughout government
on how to manage the corresponding risks. The IMF will also stay closely engaged on this
matter through its surveillance dialogue.



Labor market reforms: The IMF has highlighted the urgency of making progress on this area to
reduce structural unemployment during the 2012 and 2013 Article IV consultation. Specifically,
the IMF has called for increasing the flexibility of the wage bargaining mechanism, especially for
small and medium-size enterprises (SMEs) and newly created businesses; increasing the
flexibility of labor laws and regulations—and reducing compliance costs—to improve the

6

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

SOUTH AFRICA

business environment and increase employment opportunities; and introducing well-designed
active labor market measures to encourage youth employment and providing working
experience or on-the-job training.


Product market reforms: The IMF deepened its work on product market competition in the 2013
Article IV consultation, and intends to elaborate further proposals in the context of the 2014
Article IV consultation. The World Bank identified competition as a key impediment to faster and
more inclusive growth in its July 2012 Economic Update and is considering more in-depth
analysis in one of its upcoming biyearly Economic Updates.



Tackling high inequality: Recognizing South Africa’s exceptionally high levels of exclusion, the
World Bank is developing a systematic analytical understanding of the structure of the township
economy to grasp its full economic potential for policy action. A World Bank study on the
potential of and constraints to private sector development in less developed regions is ongoing.
Furthermore, poor education outcomes have been flagged as key determinant hampering
inclusive growth, and the World Bank is currently engaging with the Department of Basic
Education to strengthen the annual national assessments in order to improve teaching and
learning in schools. Additionally, vocational training, particularly for low-income youths, is a
strategic priority for the IFC in Sub-Saharan Africa. It will explore the possibility of supporting
private sector for- and nonprofit technical education in South Africa, with the aim of:
(i) increasing employment opportunities; (ii) raising the productivity of South African firms; and
(iii) improving income distribution, given the significant returns to education in the country.



Financial sector stability and inclusion: The IMF has cautioned in the 2013 Article IV consultation
that the rapid increase in personal loans could potentially pose risks to South Africa’s financial
sector. At the request of the National Treasury and SARB, the World Bank is reviewing South
Africa’s contingency planning and crisis management framework, assessing the institutional
set-up of financial sector supervision, and carrying out a Review of Standards and Codes (RoSC)
on Insolvency and Creditor Rights. The Bank is also working with an interministerial working
group that is assessing strategic priorities for financial inclusion.



Private investment program: Promotion of private investment and job creation is at the top of
the government agenda, and activities by the IBRD, IFC and MIGA will remain central to this
program. The IBRD will continue its support for economic diversification and micro, small and
medium enterprise (MSME) development, including technical assistance to the Department of
Trade and Industry in promoting MSME development in poorer regions, as well support for
enhancement of policies aiming at improving Research and Development efficiency. The IFC’s
strategy in South Africa will remain focused on innovation, job creation, and poverty reduction
by: (i) supporting South African companies “going north” and “going global”; (ii) providing
advice and financing in underserved niches of the South African market where IFC can add
value; (iii) providing technical assistance and related support for small business, with a focus on
the informal sector and education; and (iv) supporting the development of renewable energy
and energy efficiency projects.

STATISTICAL ISSUES
Data provided to the IMF are adequate for surveillance. South Africa subscribed to the Special Data
Dissemination Standard (SDDS) on August 2, 1996, and is in observance of specifications for
coverage, periodicity, and timeliness of data, although using a flexibility option on the timeliness
and periodicity of unemployment data. A Report on Observance of Standards and Codes—Data
Module, Response by the Authorities, and Detailed Assessments Using the Data Quality Assessment
Framework (DQAF) was published on October 16, 2001.
Real sector statistics
The national accounts are compiled according to the SNA 1993. In 2009, the base year of the
national accounts was changed from 2000 to 2005. At the same time, benchmarking was undertaken
to reflect more accurately the structure of the economy and to introduce other methodological
changes to the compilation of data. Reporting of real sector data for International Financial Statistics
(IFS) is timely.
Labor market statistics are published with lags of three months. Given the seriousness of the
unemployment problem, labor market analysis and policy design would benefit from better, more
frequent and timely labor market data. A new quarterly Labor Force Survey has been conducted in
January 2008.
The consumer price index (CPI) covers all households living in metropolitan and urban areas, which
represent approximately 56 percent of the total number of households and 75 percent of private
consumption expenditure. The current CPI weights were derived primarily from Stats SA’s household
expenditure survey. Current price indices, which were rebased to December 2012=100, are
calculated according to these weights. These indices form the basis for calculating the year-on-year
changes in the CPI for 2013 and the month-on-month change between January 2013 and
December 2012. The historical rates of inflation are not revised backward.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

SOUTH AFRICA

Government finance statistics
Data for the GFS Yearbook and IFS are compiled and disseminated according to the GFSM 2001
framework. Data for social security funds and central government’s extra budgetary funds have been
reported on an accrual basis, starting in 2000 and 2002, respectively. Starting in 2005, the authorities
have included additional noncash data for other levels of government, consistent with their
migration to accrual reporting. South Africa currently reports data for the consolidated general
government for publication in the Government Finance Statistics Yearbook. It also reports monthly
data covering the cash operations of the budgetary central government for publication in IFS.
Monetary statistics
Monetary statistics compiled by the SARB are consistent with the methodology recommended in the
Monetary and Financial Statistics Manual. South Africa regularly reports good quality monetary
statistics for publication in the IFS and the IFS Supplement, although there is room for improving the
timeliness of the data on nondepository financial institutions.
Balance of payments statistics
Balance of payments data are broadly consistent with the fifth edition of the Balance of Payments
Manual (BPM5). The authorities are also working with their partners in the Southern African Customs
Union (SACU) to improve the coverage of intra-SACU trade flows. Data reported for Direction of
Trade Statistics differ substantially from external trade data reported for IFS, particularly exports,
because of balance of payments adjustments.
Data on the international reserves position are disseminated in line with the requirements of the
IMF’s template on international reserves and foreign currency liquidity.
Work is ongoing to improve the reliability and accuracy of balance of payments data, with the aim
of reducing errors and omissions. Export and import price deflators are expected to be revised in
2013. It would also be useful to disseminate a detailed breakdown of financial account data
pertaining to other investment assets and liabilities.

STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2013 ARTICLE IV
July 19, 2013

CONSULTATION—DEBT SUSTAINABILITY ANALYSIS

Approved By
Anne-Marie Gulde-Wolf
and Vivek Arora

Prepared by the Staff Representatives for the 2013 Article IV
Consultation with South Africa

SOUTH AFRICA

PUBLIC DEBT SUSTAINABILITY ANALYSIS
1.
The public debt sustainability analysis is based on the Fund’s new Market Access Countries’
framework.1 The new debt sustainability analysis (DSA) framework, which is being piloted in a number of
countries before a full rollout later this year, uses a risk-based approach, which expands upon the basic DSA
to include: (i) an assessment of the realisim of baseline assumptions and the projected fiscal adjustment;
(ii) an analysis of risks associated with the debt profile (financing structure); (iii) macro-fiscal risks; (iv) a
stochastic debt projection taking into account past macro-fiscal volatility; and (v) a standardized summary
of risks in a heat map. For South Africa, this expanded analysis is called for by its gross financing
requirement which exceeds 10 percent of GDP.
2.
Macroeconomic assumptions. Growth is projected at 2 percent in 2013, rising gradually to 3½ by
2018 on the back of a recovery in global demand and easing infrastructure bottlenecks. The GDP deflator is
expected to average around 6½ percent, consistent with CPI inflation close to the upper range of the
authorities’ 3–6 percent target range.
3.
Fiscal assumptions. The impact of weaker-than-budgeted growth on revenues resulted in a sharp
widening of the primary deficit in 2012. The 2013 deficit is projected to remain broadly unchanged despite
a slow-down in expenditure growth, as automatic stabilizers result in continued weak revenue
performance. Consistent with the authorities’ 2013 budget, anticipated expenditure restraint and a modest
pickup in revenues is expected to result in a gradual narrowing of the deficit over the medium term. The
projections do not assume additional fiscal measures that the authorities suggested in the 2012 Medium
Term Budget Policy Statement (MTBPS) could become necessary if the deficit does not evolve as
anticipated in the 2013 budget. In addition, the framework does not assume any policy response to shocks.
4.
Data coverage. Consistent with the data on government debt reported by the authorities, the
fiscal assumptions in this DSA are based on the national government main budget. While this coverage
excludes provincial governments, social security funds, and extra-budgetary institutions, these entities are
either not allowed to incur debt or only borrow in small amounts. Moreover, most provincial and municipal
expenditure is funded through transfers from the national government main budget and thus already
captured in the projections. State-owned enterprises borrowing, however, has increased substantially in
recent years and is projected to continue to increase. Around 40 percent of this borrowing is covered by
government guarantees. The authorities are in the process of compiling statistics on the indebtedness of
the overall public sector.
5.
An expanded debt sustainability analysis is warranted given South Africa’s elevated gross
financing needs. Gross financing needs (GFN) are estimated at 12.5 percent of GDP in 2012 and are

SOUTH AFRICA

expected to peak at 14.5 percent in 2014, above the 10 percent of GDP trigger based on a conservative
assessment of early-warning results.
6.
There is no evidence of a systemic projection bias that would undermine the assessment of
sustainability. The median forecast errors for real GDP growth and the primary balance between 2004–12
are below 1 percent and in line with other countries. There is some evidence that the GDP deflator in recent
years has been underprojected, likely because of stronger than anticipated terms of trade.
7.
Cross-country experience suggests the projected fiscal adjustment is feasible. The maximum
three-year adjustment in the cyclically adjusted primary balance over the projection period (1.3 percent of
GDP) as well as the maximum level of the primary balance (-1.1 percent of GDP) is moderate when
compared to the experience in market-access countries with debt above 60 percent of GDP.
8.
Primary deficits averaging 3 percent of GDP for the past four fiscal years have resulted in
rising debt ratios and higher GFNs. Substantial fiscal stimulus helped cushion the impact of the global
economic slowdown on the economy, but also contributed to a 15 percentage point increase in the debtto-GDP ratio since 2007. Elevated deficits have brought the GFN to 12 percent of GDP, above the EM
average notwithstanding a favorable maturity structure.
9.

The DSA framework suggests South Africa’s government debt-to-GDP ratio is sustainable.



The framework uses an indicative 70 percent of GDP debt benchmark beyond which a country is
reported as high risk (red in the standardized heat map). The benchmark is based on a crosscountry early-warning exercise of emerging market countries that have experienced episodes of
debt distress.2 This benchmark compares with the 60 percent of GDP South Africa-specific debt
ceiling that staff analysis suggests is consistent with debt sustainability.3



Under the baseline the debt-to-GDP ratio is projected to increase to 48 percent by 2018. This is
20 percentage points higher than in 2008, but below the 70 percent benchmark level in the DSA
as well as the South Africa-specific debt ceiling.



The debt level remains below the DSA benchmark level and the South Africa-specific debt
ceiling even if the envisaged fiscal consolidation does not materialize and the primary balance
remains unchanged, or with a one-standard-deviation temporary shock to growth or a
temporary return of interest rates to historical highs. A customized shock entailing a permanent
half a standard deviation reduction in growth—consistent with a decline in potential growth of
around one percentage point—would increase debt to around 56 percent of GDP, still below the
DSA benchmark level but close to the South Africa-specific debt ceiling.

2

Debt distress events are defined as default to commercial or official creditors, restructuring and rescheduling
events, or IMF financing.

For further details see Box 5 in “South Africa Staff Report for the 2013 Article IV Consultation.”



A macro-fiscal shock—including the standard shocks to growth and interest rates, as well as a
primary balance shock (a temporary half a 10-year historical standard deviation deterioration in
the primary balance) and an exchange rate shock (consistent with the maximum movement over
the past 10 years and an exchange rate pass-through of 0.25 based on cross-country estimates
of pass-through in EMs4)—does result in a sharp increase in the debt-to-GDP ratio to 57½
percent. Note, however, that this is an extreme shock and the results should therefore be treated
with caution.



Fan charts—including an asymmetric fan chart that reflects the predominance of downside risks
but also the possibility of greater progress on structural reforms that would boost growth and
facilitate an improvement in the primary balance—that take into account the impact of the
historical volatility of the aforementioned macro-fiscal variables on the future debt path yield
similar results.



While not explicitly modeled, a contingent liability shock whereby the government would have
to absorb state-owned enterprise (SOE) debt would increase risks significantly. If the
government has to absorb the entire debt stock of SOE debt—estimated at 13½ percent of GDP
at end-2012—and the economy is hit by a persistent shock to growth or to a macro-fiscal shock
of the kind described above, the 70 percent debt benchmark would be exceeded. While extreme,
this exercise serves to underscore the growing vulnerability posed by contingent liabilities in
SOEs.

10.
A heat map suggests that despite its low share of foreign currency and short-term debt,
South Africa faces risks relating to its gross financing requirement and its debt profile. Even in the
baseline, South Africa’s GFN is close to the 15 percent of GDP benchmark that is considered high risk. The
standard shocks to growth or the primary balance shock, as well as the combined macro-fiscal shock and
the contingent liability shock—would push South Africa above the benchmark, indicating an increased risk
of financing difficulties. South Africa’s local currency bond spread and the relatively large share of debt held
by non-residents also point to emerging risks. These findings are consistent with staff’s assessment that a
sudden stop in capital inflows that could cause a disorderly adjustment in the twin deficits is the main risk
facing South Africa.

Authorities’ views
11.
It is laudable that the IMF has refined its framework for analyzing debt sustainability. While
improving transparency, the new framework is conditional on a much broader set of assumptions. This has
increased the data-intensity of preparatory work, and widened the scope for discretion and qualitative
analysis on the part of Fund staff.

12.
South African budget statements have indicated clearly that if risks to the economic or fiscal
outlook materialize, government’s fiscal programme will be revised where appropriate. However, a
key assumption in the Fund’s analysis is that authorities do not respond to economic developments since
the last budget. Consequently, the baseline scenario envisages a pessimistic primary balance outlook.
Despite this strong assumption, we take comfort from the fact that projected debt remains comparatively
moderate in global terms and is on a path towards stabilization. An explosive debt trajectory is not
projected in the baseline scenario nor under a range of shocks.
13.
The analysis could be strengthened by engaging with the structure of debt, the potential for
flexibility in debt management and its implications for sustainability. In South Africa’s case, the
vulnerability of the debt profile remains low, with projections assuming a debt-structure that is increasingly
long-term and largely denominated in domestic currency. South Africa has sophisticated and experienced
debt management institutions and liquid domestic bond markets. Longer term vulnerabilities typically
associated with health care and pension systems in advanced economies are also largely absent in South
Africa.

SOUTH AFRICA

EXTERNAL DEBT SUSTAINABILITY ANALYSIS
14.
South Africa’s external debt was 36 percent of GDP in 2012, but is projected to reach
41 percent of GDP by 2018. The increase in the external/GDP ratio by 5 percentage points over the
medium term reflects the persistently high current account deficit (averaging 6 percent of GDP during this
period) on the back of strong public infrastructure investment, structurally low savings, and softer terms of
trade. A normalization of global interest rates is expected to worsen the deficit in the net income balance
by ½ percent of GDP, while transfers to the other members of the Southern African Customs Union (SACU)
should remain close to 1 percent of GDP. The external deficit is expected to be financed to a large extent by
non-resident portfolio investment and other debt flows. This includes portfolio equity (which does not add
to the debt stock), local-currency bonds, with only a small share expected to come from foreign-currency
denominated debt. Net foreign direct investment is projected at 1.2 percent of GDP over the medium term.
15.
The rising external debt ratio increases South Africa’s vulnerability to external shocks and
rollover risk, but risks look manageable against a range of shocks. The large share of external debt
denominated in local currency (58 percent) and at fixed interest rates significantly lowers risks. Stress tests
indicate that the largest adverse impact would arise from a 30 percent real exchange rate depreciation, and
to a lesser extent from a further widening of the noninterest current account deficit. These shocks would
push the external debt ratio to 53 percent and 45 percent respectively by 2018. But these are likely to
represent upper bound estimates, since the standard DSA does not capture the likelihood of import
compression if those shocks were to materialize, and therefore narrower trade deficits. By contrast, a
permanent shock to real GDP growth (equivalent to half a standard deviation or about 1 percent in the
case of South Africa), as well the standard shock to interest rates (also half a standard deviation or about 50
basis points in the case of South Africa) have only minor effects, and the combined shock has a moderate
effect on external debt levels.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

Washington, D.C. 20431 USA

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2013 Article IV Consultation with South Africa
On July 31, 2013 the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded
the Article IV consultation with South Africa.1
South Africa’s economy has made important strides over the past two decades. Rising
income levels have resulted in declining poverty rates, and strong institutions and policy
frameworks have contributed to macroeconomic stability and greater integration with the
global economy. However, in recent years the country’s structural problems that are holding
back growth and job creation have come to the fore. The economy has underperformed other
emerging markets and commodity exporters, exacerbating South Africa’s already-high levels
of unemployment (25 percent) and inequality, and contributing to rising social tensions. At
the same time, weak trading partner growth, coupled with declining competitiveness and
countercyclical fiscal policy, have led to rising fiscal and current account deficits and made
South Africa vulnerable to a prolonged reversal of capital inflows and a further repricing of
risk premia. The rand has been one of the worst performing emerging market currencies in
2013, and bond yields rose sharply in May and June as concerns over the Fed’s tapering of
quantitative easing and China’s growth outlook led to rising global risk aversion and weaker
commodity prices.
The outlook is for continued sluggish growth and elevated current account deficits. Growth is
projected at 2 percent in 2013 as weak consumption growth and lackluster private investment
offset robust public investment and higher export growth. Growth is expected to rise to about
3 percent in 2014 and 3½ percent in the medium term, as infrastructure investment gradually
relieves supply bottlenecks. Unemployment is expected to remain high. A gradual
withdrawal of stimulus is projected to result in declining fiscal deficits, but continued high
imports for infrastructure investment will likely keep the current account deficit close to 6
percent of GDP throughout the projection period. Quicker implementation of much-needed
structural reforms could result in higher growth and job creation.

1

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with members,
usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial information, and discusses
with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a
report, which forms the basis for discussion by the Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the
Managing Director, as Chairman of the Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary
is transmitted to the country's authorities. An explanation of any qualifiers used in summings up can be found
here: http://www.imf.org/external/np/sec/misc/qualifiers.htm.

The balance of risks is tilted firmly to the downside. The main risk is a prolonged stop in
capital inflows and a disorderly adjustment in the twin deficits. The trigger could be either
external, e.g., a global repricing of risk resulting from an unwinding of unconventional
monetary policies in advanced economies, or a further escalation in domestic labor and social
unrest. South Africa also remains vulnerable to a further weakening of growth in Europe or a
slowdown in China and other emerging markets, particularly if accompanied by a weakening
of commodity prices.
Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors commended the significant macroeconomic progress made by South
Africa over the past two decades. However, Directors noted that lower growth in recent
years, due to external and domestic factors, has aggravated already high unemployment and
inequality. In addition, large current account and fiscal deficits have increased. To address
the vulnerabilities, create jobs, and foster inclusive growth, Directors stressed the need for
firm policy action and progress on reforms.
Directors welcomed the authorities’ National Development Plan, which outlines an
integrated strategy for structural reforms. They emphasized the importance of decisive and
timely implementation of this plan. Directors underscored that additional labor and product
markets reforms, improvements in the business climate, and trade liberalization will also be
critical to achieve faster growth and job creation.
Directors agreed with the need for gradual fiscal consolidation and welcomed the authorities’
commitment to remain within the medium-term expenditure ceilings. If growth continues to
disappoint, they saw merit in allowing automatic stabilizers to operate this year, provided
financing conditions permit. Directors underscored the need to stabilize debt and rebuild
fiscal buffers, and generally agreed that announcing a debt target could help bolster the
credibility of the medium-term fiscal outlook. They commended the authorities’ commitment
to long-term fiscal discipline and welcomed ongoing reforms to improve spending efficiency.
Directors agreed that the monetary policy stance is finely balanced and the inflation targeting
framework remains appropriate. They concurred that the exchange rate pass-through to
inflation and wage settlements are critical factors in determining the next monetary policy
move. Directors encouraged the authorities to stand ready to adjust interest rates as needed.
Directors observed that South Africa’s highly flexible exchange rate is a considerable
strength and should be maintained. Noting the costs of accumulating and managing foreign
exchange reserves, Directors in general agreed that increasing reserves will further contribute
to lower vulnerabilities. They encouraged the authorities to give consideration to regular and
pre-announced auctions to buy foreign exchange as done by some other countries. Directors
also encouraged the authorities to promote foreign direct investment and considered that
structural reforms are also needed to raise the low household savings rate and improve the
external position, which is assessed to be weaker than justified by fundamentals.

Directors noted that South Africa’s financial system is well capitalized, but risks from
unsecured lending have risen. They welcomed the authorities’ ongoing efforts to improve the
regulatory and supervisory architecture, including the recent adoption of Basel III standards.
Directors noted that the rapid expansion of unsecured credit from a low base has contributed
to financial inclusion, but highlighted areas where new measures could play a useful role to
bolster financial stability and help households deal with high indebtedness. They emphasized
that heightened vigilance is important to ensure that these risks do not become systemic and
encouraged increased coordination among regulators.

Statement by Mr. Saho, Executive Director for South Africa
July 31, 2013
1.
My authorities’ robust macroeconomic policy frameworks and institutions have
delivered sustained growth and price stability in the past two decades, despite adverse
domestic and external developments. However, the recovery from the recent global financial
crisis is proving to be more challenging than previously anticipated. Economic growth for
this year and the next is now expected to be lower than projected in the 2012 Article IV
report. This presents a profoundly difficult backdrop for macroeconomic policy in South
Africa.
2.
My South African authorities generally agree with the staff report that, although a
weak external environment is contributing to the ongoing slow recovery, domestic factors are
also at play. It is for this reason, amongst others, that my authorities announced in the 2013
Budget Review their determination to address the twin deficits problem, by implementing
structural reforms in the labor and product markets, with a view to enhancing inclusive
growth and reducing poverty. Indeed, structural reforms are key to achieving the fiscal space
needed to meet long-term economic development and social expenditure goals.
Recent Economic Developments and outlook
3.
South Africa’s economy continues to grow, but at a slower rate than anticipated at
the time of the 2012 Article IV consultation. Following the first quarter annualized growth
rate of 0.9 percent, overall annual growth is likely to be lower than the 2.5 percent growth
rate recorded in 2012. According to the latest Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) statement
of the South African Reserve Bank (SARB), the growth forecast for 2013 has been revised
down from 2.4 percent to 2.0 percent and from 3.5 percent to 3.3 percent for 2014.
4.
It is expected that economic growth in 2015 will accelerate to 3.6 per cent,
supported by robust infrastructure investment spending and easing of electricity supply
constraints as additional electricity supply from new power plants begin to come on stream.
Additionally, water supply and rail capacity upgrades, strong regional growth, and relatively
low interest rates will also provide momentum for higher levels of growth. The authorities
are aware that the risks to the growth forecasts are on the downside and these include
fragility in the global economic growth outlook, slowdown in a number of systemically
important emerging market economies, weaknesses in the domestic mining sector,
weakening commodities prices, infrastructure constraints, prolonged strike action and
rigidities in the labor and product markets.
5.
Employment growth remains subdued, particularly in the private sector. The official
unemployment rate increased from 24.9 per cent in the fourth quarter of 2012 to 25.2 per cent
in the first quarter of 2013. Of particular concern to the South African authorities is the
increase in the youth unemployment rate to 52.9 percent in the first quarter.

2

6.
With regard to inflation, the consumer price index for all urban areas in South Africa
was 5.6 percent in May 2013, vis-a-vis 5.9 percent for the previous three consecutive months.
The main contributors to the inflation outcome were housing and utilities and miscellaneous
goods and services which contributed 1.4 and 1.1 percentage points respectively. According
to the latest MPC statement, inflation is expected to average 5.9 and 5.5 percent in 2013 and
2014 respectively, while the forecast for 2015 is 5.2 percent. According to the survey
conducted by the Bureau for Economic Research at Stellenbosch University during the
second quarter of 2013, inflation expectations have remained anchored around the upper end
of the inflation target band of 3 – 6 percent.
Monetary and exchange rate policies
7.
Monetary policy in South Africa remains supportive of growth. The downside risks
to growth have already resulted in the monetary authorities being more tolerant of inflation at
the upper end of the target range than would normally have been the case - an approach that
is consistent with a flexible inflation targeting framework. Recent developments, however,
indicate that some inflationary pressures are beginning to emerge, mainly due to continued
currency weakness and higher-than-expected petrol price increases.
8.
The risks to the inflation outlook are tilted to the upside and are mainly related to
uncertainty regarding exchange rate developments as well as the expected outcome of the
present round of wage bargaining which is critical in determining the extent of wage
pressures on the inflation outlook. This outlook reduces somewhat the scope for further
monetary accommodation. The SARB recognizes the conflicting policy choices relating to
rising inflation uncertainty and slowing growth and will continue to monitor developments
closely and act appropriately in order to sustain the credibility of its inflation targeting
regime.
9.
Furthermore, the South African monetary authorities are concerned about the
potential impact of the withdrawal of stimulus by advanced countries. It is already becoming
clear that uncertainty regarding the timing of the stimulus withdrawal by the US Federal
Reserve is already generating capital flow reversals that impact adversely on domestic bond
and currency markets in particular. However, it is the view of the authorities that the staff is a
bit more alarmist than necessary in expressing their concerns with regard to South Africa’s
vulnerability if capital flows were to reverse (page 12, paragraph 17). South Africa’s flexible
exchange rate regime, which the authorities have allowed to operate to adjust to outflows or
inflows of capital, has provided a crucial adjustment mechanism which has cushioned the
economy against shocks. Even at the height of the global financial crisis, South Africa did
not experience liquidity shortages, as several emerging market economies experienced, as the
country allowed the exchange rate to adjust to the availability to reserve currency liquidity.
10.
Regarding accumulation of reserves, my authorities are aware of the staff advice that
it could also be useful for South Africa to build reserves through regular and pre-announced
auctions to buy small amounts of FX, as done by other countries, such as Israel, Mexico, and
Turkey. My authorities would like to reiterate the view they expressed during the 2012

3
Article IV consultation, i.e. they recognize the importance of accumulating reserves for
precautionary purposes. However, this needs to be balanced against the cost of reserves build
up and management. Hence, my authorities will continue the process of opportunistically
accumulating reserves without unduly impacting on the exchange rate. The South African
authorities are willing to consider any policy advice regarding the accumulation and
management of reserves, provided that the potential benefits and costs are robustly
established.
Fiscal policy
11.
My authorities are committed to pursuing sound fiscal policy management which
seeks to balance the need to provide support for economic growth while ensuring sustainable
public debt. Owing to weaker than anticipated economic growth and revenue collection
below projections, a budget deficit of 5.2 per cent in 2012/13 fiscal year was recorded. The
staff report seems to incorrectly suggest that the government wage bill explains most of this
deterioration. My authorities view is that most of the deterioration is attributable to a sharp
decline in revenues. During 2009/10 when most of the deterioration started to take place,
wages and salaries only increased by 1.1 percentage points of GDP (Page 42, Table 2). Tax
revenues, however, contracted by 2.5 percentage points of GDP. Since then, both have
stabilized.
12.
My authorities acknowledge that in the absence of growth picking up, the
deterioration may continue. As a result, they have taken additional steps to ensure that
expenditure remains firmly under control, by further adjusting the medium-term expenditure
allocations to national departments downwards. The authorities stand ready to make further
adjustments to the budget during the regular October Adjustment Budget should the
circumstances warrant.
13.
The authorities have also embarked on efforts to increase the efficiency of taxation
and spending and to eliminate waste. To support this endeavor, the Ministers’ Committee on
the Budget has been assigned the responsibility to oversee expenditure reviews in the coming
year and to analyze patterns of public spending, including personnel spending. The reviews
will also identify opportunities to improve value for money, such as enhanced procurement
controls and the phasing out of projects that are ineffective or no longer aligned with policy
priorities.
14.
On the tax front, a committee has been set up to inquire into the role of the tax
system in the promotion of inclusive economic growth, employment creation, development
and fiscal sustainability. Its mandate includes examining the overall tax base and burden, the
corporate tax system and the mining tax regime, including the appropriate tax mix between
personal income tax, corporate income tax and value added tax.
15.
With regard to the wage bill, the authorities note the assertion by staff that the
growth of the wage bill has crowded out government capital expenditure “which is
increasingly undertaken by public enterprises” (Page 10, first bullet, SM/13/226). My
authorities do not agree with this assertion. Their view is that public enterprises continue to

4
be responsible for economic infrastructure, and have not been required to take on any new
role as a result of spending pressures elsewhere in the budget. While they acknowledge
“crowding out” from the wage bill as a long run concern, they consider the main obstacle to
government’s social infrastructure spend in the short to medium term as lack of capacity
resulting in under spending, particularly in municipalities.
Financial stability
16.
South Africa’s financial soundness indicators remain strong, but the rapid expansion
of unsecured lending to households has increased credit risk. South Africa's unsecured
consumer lending market has experienced significant growth in recent years, following the
introduction of the National Credit Act in 2007. This growth was also supported by the
decline in interest rates to a near 40-year low, and strong nominal wage increases. My
authorities do recognize the increased credit risk, nevertheless they note that the development
has rendered access to finance more inclusive.
17.
It is also important to note that unsecure credit growth has moderated recently. On
the basis of information from six banks that are significant role players in the unsecured retail
credit market, the year-on-year (y-o-y) growth in unsecured retail other (which largely
consists of unsecured personal term loans) has tapered off since peaking at 33.6 per cent in
August 2012 to 19.0 per cent in May 2013. The y-o-y growth in retail other category
consisting of loans greater than R30 000 decreased from a peak of 71.2 per cent in November
2012 to 40.3 per cent in May 2013. Unsecured loans in the retail other category consisting of
loans equal to or less than R30 000 has been contracting since March 2013.
18.
My authorities do not expect the sector to experience a 'hard landing' in view of the
current moderate inflation and low interest rate environment, as well as heightened
regulatory scrutiny. In any event, the unsecured credit levels are still too small compared
with the overall banking assets to pose any threat to the overall stability of the banking
system.
Structural Reforms
19.
As the staff report pointed out, my authorities are aware of the imperatives of
structural reforms. As a result, the 2013/14 Budget, which is consistent with the National
Development Plan (NDP), has mapped out an integrated strategy for accelerating inclusive
growth, eliminating poverty and reducing inequality. The Department of Performance
Monitoring and Evaluation has started to develop a medium-term strategic framework that
will guide NDP implementation over the next five years. Already, some progress has been
made in several areas such as infrastructure, public service delivery, and accountability. In
this regard, my authorities are committed to improving capacity to plan, procure, manage and
monitor projects, as well as working more closely with the private sector at various stages of
the project development cycle.
20.
On product market reforms, the Competition Commission’s powers have been
strengthened, and the South African authorities are committed to enhancing the level of

5
competition in a various sectors. The ultimate objective is to encourage free entry and exit by
stakeholders. In addition to issuing licenses and setting tariffs, regulators are now called upon
to place more emphasis on stimulating market competition and promoting affordable access
to quality services. The authorities acknowledge that fulfilling this role will require capacity
building in regulatory institutions and discussions are ongoing as to how best to achieve this.
21.
Finally, with regard to labor market reforms, it is important to recognize that labor
markets in South Africa are relatively more complicated, primarily due to the legacies of
apartheid. Therefore, reforming the labor market is a long-term project and my authorities are
committed to developing social consensus, which will be critical for managing trade-offs
between reform options.
