EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
The 2008 Article IV consultation discussions focused on policies to contain inflation, the
need to improve the quality and efficiency of public expenditure, and measures to strengthen
the resilience of the banking system to shocks and to promote the development of the
financial sector.
Economic developments and outlook
Economic growth was strong in 2007, led by a major increase in oil production. Non-oil
GDP continued to expand rapidly pushed by large increases in public expenditure, including
wages and pensions. The overall fiscal balance was in surplus, but the non-oil primary deficit
deteriorated. A large current account surplus resulted in a major accumulation of foreign
reserves and oil fund assets. But inflation rose to almost 20 percent, also reflecting the lack
of monetary and exchange rate policy actions to reduce the impact of the fiscal expansion,
and an uncompetitive business environment. The growth and external outlook remains
favorable on account of strong oil production and prices, but, if macroeconomic policies
remain loose, inflation will remain high.
The authorities’ views
The authorities intend to continue with their expansionary fiscal plans in 2008, in line with
their strategy to pursue fast improvements in living standards and infrastructures to set the
basis for long-term non-oil growth. They reported intentions to moderate the fiscal expansion
in 2009. In the meantime, they have adopted a new exchange rate arrangement that pegs the
manat to a dollar/euro currency basket, aimed at keeping the nominal effective exchange rate
stable. They expect the new arrangement to help contain imported inflation and view it as a
step towards preparing the foreign exchange market for more exchange rate flexibility. The
ANB has strengthened prudential regulations and supervision to contain potential risks from
a very rapid credit expansion. The authorities are also considering measures to develop the
financial market.
Staff recommendations
•

Moderate the 2008 fiscal expansion and tighten the fiscal stance in 2009 to avoid the
entrenchment of a nascent wage-price spiral.

•

Facilitate the unavoidable real exchange rate adjustment through more nominal
appreciation rather than through higher inflation, by allowing the manat to appreciate
against the basket.

•

Significantly strengthen the medium-term expenditure framework to improve the quality
and efficiency of public spending and the monitoring of financial operations of public
enterprises.

•

Reinforce the enforcement of current and planned prudential regulation to address
probable risks from a very rapid credit expansion.

•

Take steps to help the development of the financial market and measures to enhance
competition and strengthen the supply response of the economy.

I. INTRODUCTION
1.
Major expansions in oil and gas production and large increases in public
expenditure resulted in spectacular growth in Azerbaijan during 2005–07. Annual real
growth has been above 20 percent since 2005, resulting in higher living standards, lower
unemployment, and rapidly declining poverty. While the oil boom has created unprecedented
opportunities for economic and social development, its temporary nature and the
expansionary policies being pursued pose significant macroeconomic challenges going
forward.
2.
The short and medium-term challenges have not changed much from those
identified in the 2007 Article IV consultation, but they have intensified. Booming oil
revenues will continue to provide abundant financing for large increases in government
spending in the pursuit of a fast-track development strategy. Real appreciation pressures
from the recent terms-of-trade gains, amplified by the large fiscal expansion, will continue to
occur mostly through high inflation, particularly if monetary and exchange rate policy
remains subdued. Growing government spending is likely to deepen problems with
expenditure quality and efficiency, in the absence of more effective public expenditure
management. Unless structural reforms are deepened, governance problems and an
uncompetitive business environment are likely to hinder a stronger supply response. Finally,
rapid credit expansion and limited risk assessment capacity by banks pose new challenges for
regulation and supervision, while an underdeveloped financial system limits long-term
funding and saving options.
3.

The discussions focused on:

¾ The appropriate macroeconomic policy mix to reduce inflation through a more restrained
fiscal policy and a more determined use of exchange rate policy;
¾ The need to improve the quality and efficiency of public expenditures, particularly for
public investment; and,
¾ Measures to strengthen the resilience of the banking system to shocks and to promote the
development of the financial sector.

The dominance of oil has increased, driving Azerbaijan’s strong economic
growth performance (Table 1).1 In 2007, oil GDP grew by 37 percent and accounted for
59 percent of total GDP. Non-oil growth remained strong at about 12 percent, driven mostly
by strong non-tradable sectors activity, particularly construction, commerce, and
communications. The spectacular growth coupled with very high oil prices pushed per capita
GDP to an estimated $3,663, and the official rates of poverty and unemployment declined
significantly.

Inflation accelerated, reflecting fiscal-induced demand pressures, rising
international food and commodity prices, increases in administered energy prices, and
an accommodative monetary policy. Twelve-month inflation reached 19.5 percent in
December, and remained high at 18.2 percent in March 2008, despite the fact that the
January 2007 large energy price increase had already been absorbed in the base. The real
effective exchange rate appreciation continued, because of widening inflation differentials
with Azerbaijan’s trading partners.

The consolidated fiscal balance returned to surplus in 2007, but the non-oil
primary deficit to non-oil GDP ratio increased (Tables 3 and 4). Oil revenue grew by
about 60 percent, and rising incomes and consumption—together with improved tax
administration—boosted non-oil revenue (Box 1). Budgetary expenditure rose to 66 percent
of non-oil GDP. Wages and transfers together increased by 46 percent. Following a two-fold
jump in 2006, investment spending rose by 63 percent, and progress to strengthen
expenditure planning, execution, and monitoring, particularly of large projects, was limited.

7
Box 1. Non-Oil Revenues: Recent Developments and Policy Issues
The rapid increase in non-oil revenues from 22 percent of non-oil GDP in 2003 to 33¼ percent in 2007 reflects
booming consumption and growing incomes and corporate profits, which constitute the base of the VAT and income
taxes, respectively. In addition, significant improvements in tax administration, particularly during 2006–07, have
also generated very positive results.

The following measures are at the core of the recent improvements:
•

A major cleanup of the VAT registration system cut almost by a half the number of registered taxpayers over
2005–07, and reduced fraud by eliminating unjustified refunds;

•

Improved taxpayers’ services strengthened voluntary compliance; and

•

The introduction of an automated system covering all non-oil taxes eased significantly tax processing.

Nevertheless, non-oil tax revenues remain below
potential. This is explained by a costly system of
exemptions regarding the VAT; customs administration
problems that continue to undermine the revenues from
non-oil customs duties; and a large, but difficult-toquantify informal economy that mostly escapes the tax
system.
In the short term, the authorities expect to broaden the
non-oil tax base by: (i) implementing a modern system
of risk-management for audits; (ii) strengthening
voluntary compliance and establishing basic conditions
for effective self-assessment; and (iii) reducing non-oil
VAT exemptions. Progress on customs administration is
expected once new regulations consistent with WTO
rules are approved and implemented.
The authorities are also considering a comprehensive
review of non-oil tax policy to support the development
of medium-sized companies and the diversification of
the economy. In particular, they are interested in a
simpler tax system with flat and lower personal and
corporate income taxes, and a lower VAT rate, once the
non-oil tax base has been further expanded.

Tax credits to the state oil and energy companies were reduced, reflecting increased energy
prices and better collection rates. Yet, the government was unable to make a comprehensive
assessment of the quasi-fiscal activities of the large state-owned enterprises (SOEs), since
their economic and financial operations in 2007 were not adequately monitored. Staff
estimates the implicit energy subsidies at about 15 percent of non-oil GDP, because of an
increasing gap between domestic energy prices and world prices since the January 2007
adjustment.

Policy coordination problems and limited operational independence at the ANB
constrained the monetary policy response to the fiscal-induced overheating. In the
context of a de facto slowly appreciating crawling peg to the dollar, the pace of manat
appreciation was lower than originally
700
envisaged by the authorities. The ANB
ANB Monthly Net Purchases
600
(In millions of U.S. dollars)
established a new interest rate corridor
500
to provide a better signaling mechanism,
400
but policy interest rates remained
negative in real terms. The ANB bought 300
from the government about US$2 billion 200
in 2007—of which one third in
100
December—and sterilized only a
0
fraction of the currency issued in
-100
exchange, leading to about 100 percent
increase in manat base money. There is
little evidence that the July 2007 removal of restrictions on capital outflows to OECD
countries had the intended effect of mitigating the monetary expansion. Abundant liquidity
and increasing foreign borrowing by banks, boosted an accelerating credit expansion
(Tables 5 and 6).

In March 2008, the ANB announced the introduction of a new exchange rate
arrangement aimed at stabilizing the manat nominal effective exchange rate. The manat
is now pegged to a dollar/euro currency basket, in which the weight of the euro will gradually
increase. The basket peg and the envisaged weight adjustments are aimed at mitigating
imported inflation.
10.
Banks’ prudential indicators improved and supervision strengthened in 2007, but
credit risks intensified and some structural weaknesses of the banking system persisted
(Table 7 and Box 2). Deposits and assets concentration at the largest bank -state-owned
International Bank of Azerbaijan (IBA)—declined, but is still high. The new deposit insurance
scheme covers 37 out of 46 banks and is strengthening depositors’ confidence. At end-2007,
all banks met the 12 percent regulatory risk-weighted capital adequacy requirement. However,
credit to the economy almost doubled in 2007, creating new risks.
11.
The financial system is underdeveloped, providing few long-term instruments for
savers and investors. The limited stock exchange activity is concentrated in treasury bills and
ANB notes. Government bonds are issued with a maximum one-year maturity. In the absence
of a yield curve, the corporate bond market is very thin, limiting funding choices for
companies. With no domestic mutual or private pension funds and minimal life insurance, the
government and corporate bonds market is illiquid. For individuals, there are virtually no
domestic savings products beyond bank accounts—currently providing negative real returns—
and real estate.
12.
Structural reforms to promote a competitive non-oil sector remain slow, but
WTO accession plans are driving new efforts. The one-stop facility for business registration
is now operational, facilitating the establishment of new companies. Licensing requirements,
though, remain heavy and unregulated, and governance issues—particularly in customs—are
quoted by business as major impediments. Parliamentary approval of important bills to
strengthen governance and the business environment (e.g. anti-monopoly, investment, and
AML/CFT laws) has been pending for more than a year. Nonetheless, ongoing work to
upgrade legislation in line with WTO rules in areas such as customs and technical standards
and specifications is expected to improve the business environment.

10

Box 2. Banking Sector Developments
Azerbaijan’s banking sector has registered stunning growth in recent years. The degree of monetization,
measured as the ratio of broad money to non-oil GDP, has doubled in the past two years. Banking sector credit to
the economy has expanded by more than 50 percent per year since 2004; it grew by 96 percent in 2007. Private
banks have grown faster than state-owned banks, and accounted for 58 percent of total assets at end-2007, from
45 percent two years ago.

Public banks' share of total assets

The officially reported soundness indicators and compliance with prudential regulations generally improved
in 2007. All banks met the capital adequacy requirement at end-2007, including the two state-owned banks.1
Nonperforming loan (NPL) ratios declined significantly, largely reflecting a doubling of credit outstanding during
the year. There was no bank violating the limit on net open foreign exchange position at end-2007. In addition, the
authorities’ stress test shows that the banking system is resilient to interest rate and exchange rate shocks of
moderate magnitude.
However, the current credit boom poses risks to the banking sector. Rapid credit expansion coupled with
limited risk management capacity may lead to a lagged deterioration in the quality of banks’ portfolios. The risks
could intensify in a couple of years when the economic activity is projected to slow down. Discussions with the
ANB and commercial banks also revealed that the banking sector is highly exposed to the property sector through
lending to the construction sector and using property as collateral for other loans. Furthermore, a few banks may
face liquidity risks as they funded new credit in 2007 partially through external borrowing that needs to be
refinanced in 2008, although the scale of foreign borrowing was constrained by the tightening global liquidity
conditions in the latter part of the year.
The ANB has moved to take prudential and other measures to address increasing risks. Measures in the
pipeline include: (i) introducing reserve requirements on foreign borrowing; (ii) tightening asset classification
standards and raising provisioning requirements for NPLs; (iii) restricting the use of subordinate debt in meeting
the capital adequacy requirements; iv) increasing the risk weight for mortgage loans and toughening the criteria for
collateralized loans. Moreover, the ANB reviewed banks’ risk management systems, carried out more targeted
inspections, and pushed banks to reduce credit growth targets.

III. OUTLOOK
13.
Azerbaijan’s short- and medium-term economic prospects remain strongly
dependent on oil sector developments, and on how the authorities manage the related
opportunities and challenges. The main risk to the outlook is a major downward correction in
oil prices, although unlikely in the short
600
term. However, if loose macroeconomic

sector.
A. Short-Term
14.
The growth and external outlook for 2008 remains strong, with overall growth
projected at 18½ percent. Non-oil growth—driven by large public expenditure—would
moderate to a still high 9 percent. The current account surplus would rise to 40 percent of GDP,
reflecting higher oil export volumes and prices. Oil fund assets and international reserves are
projected to more than triple from end-2007, to reach $25 billion at end 2008—about
50 percent of projected GDP.
15.
Large public spending plans are expected to keep aggregate demand and inflation
high in 2008.2 Massive increases in oil revenue underpin a projected overall fiscal surplus of
29 percent of GDP, matched by a major accumulation of oil fund assets. Despite buoyant
non-oil revenue, the non-oil primary deficit would worsen by 7 percentage points of non-oil
GDP to reach 39 percent, reflecting pension and wage increases of about 40 percent and a
55 percent rise in investment. Heightened aggregate demand would keep inflation close to
20 percent.
16.
The implementation of the currency basket arrangement should help limit the
impact of imported inflation, by containing the inflationary effect of import price increases
triggered by the depreciation of the dollar against other major currencies. Preparing the ground
for more flexibility in the future, the new arrangement will also help address the current
undervaluation of the manat (Box 3).

The 2008 projections are based on the budget and staff’s assessment of preliminary plans for a mid-year
supplementary budget.

16 percent.
For a country like Azerbaijan, which is undergoing a temporary oil production boom, the
standard MB approach does not provide a very robust valuation of the currency. Given
Azerbaijan’s oil production profile, the country is bound to register sizable underlying current
account surpluses during the peak production years. However, looking beyond the peak
production years, Azerbaijan’s underlying current account balance will decline sharply, as
exemplified by a fall in the current account surplus from 12 percent of GDP in 2012 to below
1 percent in 2013. A one-year extension in the timeframe of the analysis to 2014 would entail a
further decline of the underlying current account, taking it closer to the norm and substantially
reducing the measured degree of exchange rate undervaluation. Moreover, a significant portion
of the current account surplus is to be accumulated in the state oil fund, reflecting the need to
save the oil wealth to achieve intergenerational equity. Thus any normative analysis must allow
for this temporary buildup in reserves. Allowing for Azerbaijan’s particular situation, the
assessed magnitude of exchange rate undervaluation does not represent an exchange rate
misalignment.
Alternative approaches to exchange rate assessment. Data deficiency precludes the
application of the equilibrium real exchange rate approach, and the external sustainability
approach suffers the same bias as the MB approach. The purchasing power parity approach,
which relies solely on the relationship between relative prices and incomes per capita, indicates
that Azerbaijan’s REER was undervalued by about 15 percent in 2007.

The scenario is based on the assumption of unchanged policies. Although the authorities have mentioned their
intention to slow down expenditure increases starting in 2009, they have not yet prepared a medium-term fiscal
framework consistent with this intention.

IV.

THE AUTHORITIES’ VIEWS

A. Macroeconomic Policy Mix to Reduce Inflation
19.
Although they consider inflation uncomfortably high, the authorities do not plan
to reduce the pace of public spending in 2008. They see the 2007 inflation outcome as
exceptional, reflecting the early 2007 energy price increases and the rise in international
commodity prices, as well as the fiscal expansion. Their short-term concerns with high
inflation still give way to the importance they attach to using the oil wealth early on to
improve living standards and critical infrastructure. The mid-year supplementary budget will
thus include allocations for pension increases and accommodate the rising costs of imported
inputs for investment projects. The authorities noted that the recent introduction of the new
VAT bank accounts is likely to raise VAT collection above projections, with a cooling effect
on aggregate demand.4
20.
The government agreed that, going forward, fiscal moderation and better policy
coordination are necessary to reduce inflation and achieve long-term growth and fiscal
sustainability. Progress toward establishing a medium-term macroeconomic framework has
been made with the establishment of a macroeconomic coordination committee comprising
the main economic policy makers. The authorities intend to prepare the 2009 budget in the
context of a coherent medium-term framework.
21.
The currency basket arrangement will be used to limit imported inflation. The
authorities conceded that last year a slow pace of appreciation against the dollar added to the
inflation dynamics. They see the new basket peg as an effective tool in containing imported
inflation, with the manat appreciating faster versus the U.S. dollar under current conditions.
They also stressed that by creating the possibility of two-way movements in the manat/dollar
exchange rate, the new arrangement will help develop the foreign exchange market, and
encourage the introduction of hedging instruments. The ANB sees a more developed and
deeper foreign exchange market as a precondition toward greater exchange rate flexibility to
be pursued over time.
22.
Though real appreciation pressures continue, the authorities consider the
undervaluation of the manat to be moderate and a temporary phenomenon. They noted
that a relatively short oil-production horizon in Azerbaijan justifies their intention to limit
nominal appreciation at this juncture of booming oil exports so as to avoid the need for
abrupt depreciation when oil production declines sharply.

4

The new system, aimed at reducing fraud, requires registered VAT taxpayers to maintain a sub-account with
the ANB through which all VAT transactions (output and input taxes) must pass. Monthly net VAT liabilities
must be paid from this account.

18
23.
The ANB does not plan to use interest rates actively to respond to inflation
because of a weak transmission mechanism and fears of speculative capital flows. There
is no intention to raise policy rates significantly in the short term, despite negative real
interest rates. The authorities emphasized that liquidity conditions in the system are cyclical
and largely linked to tax payments and government spending and do not respond effectively
to interest rate changes. Moreover, appreciation pressures on the manat and large interest rate
differentials with partner countries are already attracting short-term speculative flows, which
the ANB intends to contain.
B. Improving the Quality and Efficiency of Public Expenditures
24.
The government recognized that the high pace of spending is undermining
the quality and efficiency of public projects. Line ministers have therefore been instructed
to complete existing projects, before they can initiate new ones. With assistance from
development partners, the government is also building up domestic capacity to conduct costbenefit analysis for project proposals. Moreover, some large projects co-financed by the
World Bank and other IFIs are subject to higher standards both at the preparation and
execution stage; this will help strengthen project management capacity in the administration.
25.
The adoption of IFRS accounting starting in 2008 will enhance the transparency
of SOEs’ operations and their financial discipline. The authorities reported that all large
SOEs have submitted their 2008 budget plans for vetting to the ministry of finance. A few
SOEs need to provide clarifications on their spending plans, but the majority of the SOEs’
budgets have already been vetted. The government has also adopted a schedule for intra-year
monitoring of individual enterprises’ budget execution. These measures are expected to
increase SOEs’ financial discipline and accountability.
C. Strengthening the Financial System
26.
The authorities are well aware of the structural weaknesses of the banking
system and will continue to address them. The privatization of Kapital Bank will be
completed in 2008 and, on the basis of that experience, the authorities will prepare plans for
privatizing IBA. They also expect the minimum capital requirement introduced in 2007 to
help consolidate the banking system and increase efficiency. A few large international banks
have already set up representative offices in Azerbaijan and may decide to establish branches
or subsidiaries. The authorities welcome enhanced foreign participation in the banking
system to promote competition and the adoption of international best practices.
27.
The ANB is taking sound supervisory measures to contain the risks from the
sharp increase in bank lending. The authorities shared staff’s concerns that the rapid credit
expansion makes deterioration in credit quality probable, especially during economic
downturns. They consider the measures already taken and those in the pipeline as adequate to
contain systemic risks. The ANB noted that its capacity to operate risk-based supervision is

19
strengthening and that recent increase in ANB salaries will improve staff retention, namely
skilled supervisors.
28.
The authorities agreed on the importance of developing other sectors of the
financial system, including the bond, insurance, and private pension markets. The
government is keen to encourage the development of a deeper financial system and is
considering the issuance of longer term bonds to help establish a yield curve and support the
development of the corporate bond market. However, the authorities are concerned that the
interest rate levels needed to make longer-term bonds attractive domestically would draw
additional foreign speculative flows and complicate further macroeconomic management.
V. STAFF APPRAISAL
29.
Azerbaijan’s economic prospects are favorable, but sustainable improvements in
economic conditions require cautious management. The impressive progress in living
standards of the last few years is a major achievement, but it is at risk if the upward inflation
trend persists. While inflationary pressures have emerged globally, the inflation dynamics in
Azerbaijan has been particularly rapid. Macroeconomic policy should be adjusted promptly
to prevent high inflation expectations from becoming entrenched, driving the nascent wageprice spiral, and inflicting serious damage on long-term growth prospects.
30.
Given strong fiscal dominance, successful disinflation requires fiscal
adjustment. An adjustment process that allows for continuous but moderate increases in
real public spending would still allow for higher living standards and a gradual upgrade of
productive infrastructure. Given the current high inflation environment, the government
needs to move determinedly to establish its anti-inflation credentials. Efforts at moderating
the 2008 fiscal expansion and fiscal tightening in 2009 would send a credible signal.
31.
The adjustment should focus on reducing the pace of expenditure increases.
Although strong tax administration will help keep non-oil taxes buoyant, an adjustment in the
pace of expenditure is critical to cool down aggregate demand in an economy where the
supply response is limited. A successful moderation in expenditure and further achievements
with broadening the tax base would eventually provide space for reducing tax rates and
support the authorities’ objective of promoting the development of a competitive non-oil
private sector.
32.
Expenditure moderation would also help address increasing problems with the
quality and efficiency of public spending, particularly investment. The extraordinary
increase in investment spending since 2005 calls for the urgent establishment of effective
institutional mechanisms to ensure proper planning execution and monitoring of public
projects. The adoption of a comprehensive medium-term expenditure framework (MTEF) in
the context of the 2009 budget—consistent with medium-term macroeconomic stability—
would be a major step. An adequate MTEF should reflect transparently the government’s

20
priority, the cost-benefits of projects, and their recurrent maintenance costs. Institutional
improvements in the areas of internal auditing and public procurement and the adoption of
international public sector accounting standards would enhance accountability and value for
money.
33.
In a similar vein, a better monitoring of SOEs’ operations is needed. The largest
SOEs can have significant impact on aggregate demand. To ensure that their operations are
consistent with the government’s macroeconomic objectives, the corporate governance of the
largest enterprises should be strengthened. Following on the 2005 OECD guidelines for best
practices in managing commercially oriented SOEs, it is critical to separate the commercial
and regulatory functions of SOEs—particularly utilities. In addition, SOEs’ decision-making
process should become more transparent and the chain of accountability of managers should
be clarified.
34.
Monetary and exchange rate policy needs to be used actively to fight inflation.
Staff welcomes the adoption of the new currency basket arrangement and encourages the
authorities to use it more actively to fight inflation, particularly given that interest rate
changes have limited effect on aggregate demand. The authorities should consider allowing
the manat appreciate against the basket in case of continued inflationary pressures.
35.
The real exchange rate appears to be moderately undervalued. However,
allowing for the temporary nature of the current oil production boom, the undervaluation
should be less than what the standard approaches indicate. As long as real appreciation
pressures persist in the medium term, the authorities should consider introducing more
flexibility in the new basket peg to prevent the real appreciation from materializing mostly
through high inflation.
36.
Completing the state’s disengagement from bank ownership is necessary to
create a level playing field and strengthen competition in the banking system. Once the
privatization of Kapital Banka is finalized, the government should proceed to prepare the
privatization of IBA. A transparent sale process for this systemically important bank is of
utmost importance for the sound development of the banking system.
37.
The ANB’s supervisory measures are welcome, but substantial risks remain.
Stronger enforcement of the current and planned prudential measures would help contain
risks. To anticipate the likely increase in the proportion of nonperforming loans, the ANB
should consider raising the general provision for collateralised loans—currently at
2 percent—in recognition of difficulties in claiming collateral. A higher risk-weight for
foreign currency loans to customers whose income is in manat would also be a sound
prudential measure.
38.
Government support for capital market development is needed, mainly through
the issuance of government bonds of varying maturities to establish a yield curve as the basis

21
for pricing corporate debt. The participation of institutional investors could be further
encouraged by changes to the law to allow the development of mutual funds. Full
implementation of the requirement on larger companies to follow IFRS accounting would
bring transparency in corporate financial statements and support the development of the
equity and bond markets.
39.
The implementation of a coherent structural reform agenda is critical to
promote strong non-oil growth over the medium term. Strong market concentration in
several sectors of the economy indicates that there are informal obstacles to competition,
which need to be addressed. The WTO accession process is providing a useful framework for
reforms. A priority should be the envisaged reform of customs legislation and administrative
practices, including regulations for customs valuation, a simplified tariff schedule, and the
introduction of a single document for custom clearance. Progress in these areas would help
reduce nontariff barriers to imports and increase the supply response of sectors currently
shielded from competition.
40.

It is proposed that Azerbaijan remains on a 12-month consultation cycle.

1/ Public and publicly guaranteed external and domestic gross debt.
2/ Derived as [(r - p(1+g) - g + ae(1+r)]/(1+g+p+gp)) times previous period debt ratio, with r = interest rate; p = growth rate of GDP deflator; g = real GDP growth rate; a = share
of foreign-currencydenominated debt; and e = nominal exchange rate depreciation (measured by increase in local currency value of U.S. dollar).
3/ The real interest rate contribution is derived from the denominator in footnote 2/ as r - π (1+g) and the real growth contribution as -g.
4/ The exchange rate contribution is derived from the numerator in footnote 2/ as ae(1+r).
5/ For projections, this line includes exchange rate changes.
6/ Defined as public sector deficit, plus amortization of medium and long-term public sector debt, plus short-term debt at end of previous period.
7/ $70 per barrel starting from 2008.
8/ Derived as nominal interest expenditure divided by previous period debt stock.
9/ Assumes that key variables (real GDP growth, real interest rate, and other identified debt-creating flows) remain at the level of the last projection year.

GDP deflator in U.S. dollar terms, g=real GDP growth rate, e = nominal appreciation (increase in dollar value of domestic currency), and a = share of domestic-currency denominated
debt in total external debt
2/ The contribution from price and exchange rate changes is defined as [-r(1+g) + ea(1+r)]/(1+g+r+gr) times previous period debt stock. r increases with an appreciating domestic
currency (e > 0) and rising inflation (based on GDP deflator).

Safeguards Assessment

Under the Fund’s safeguards assessment policy, Azerbaijan National Bank (ANB) was
subject to an assessment with respect to the PRGF arrangement, which was approved on
July 6, 2001 and expired on July 4, 2005. A safeguards assessment of the ANB was
completed on March 8, 2002. The assessment concluded that risks may exist in the legal
structure and independence of the Central Bank, and in its internal audit and control systems.
The authorities have implemented all but one of the 2002 safeguards assessment
recommendations. The National Bank Law adopted in 2004 clearly specifies the modalities
for the ANB profit distribution, consistent with one of the last two outstanding
recommendations, and requires that ANB’s internal audit division be responsible only to the

3
chairman of the ANB Board. The latter falls short of establishing an independent audit
committee under the Board, as recommended by the safeguards assessment mission.
VIII.

Exchange Rate Arrangements

The currency of Azerbaijan is the manat, which became sole legal tender on January 1, 1994.
Currently de jure, the exchange rate is allowed to float against all currencies. Exchange rates
for cash transactions are quoted by commercial banks licensed to deal in foreign exchange on
the basis of market conditions. A new de facto exchange rate arrangement that pegs the manat
to a dollar/euro currency basket became operational in March 2008, replacing a crawling peg
exchange rate system that had been in place since 2006.
Azerbaijan accepted the obligations of Article VIII, Sections 2, 3, and 4 effective
November 30, 2004 and maintains an exchange system that is free of restrictions on the
making of payments and transfers for current international transactions, except for restrictions
maintained for security reasons that have been notified to the Fund.
IX.

Article IV Consultation

The 2007 Article IV consultation with Azerbaijan was concluded on May 9, 2007.

ROSCs

A fiscal transparency ROSC module was prepared by FAD (SM/00/278, 12/12/01) and
updated in April 2003 (SM/03/159, 04/30/03). A fiscal ROSC update mission took place
in April 2005. A data dissemination ROSC module was completed by STA in March 2003
(IMF Country Report No. 03/86). The authorities published the fiscal ROSC, and it is
available on the IMF web site. Several financial systems ROSC were conducted in the
context of the FSAP (2003–04) but were not published. A CPI data ROSC took place in
February 2008.

Resident Representative

Mr. Koba Gvenetadze, the Fund's sixth Resident Representative, took up his duties in Baku in
January 2008.
XII.

Resident Advisers

An adviser on the establishment of the Treasury in the Ministry of Finance, Mr. Nurcan
Aktürk, was stationed in Baku from December 1994 until September 1996. He was succeeded
by Mr. B.K. Chaturvedi, whose assignment was extended twice, first through August 2000,
and then through May 2001. Mr. B.K. Chaturvedi was replaced by Mr. A. Khan, whose
assignment started in May 2001 and ended in August 2002. A technical long-term adviser for
tax administration, Mr. Mark Zariski, was stationed in Baku from April 1995 until April 1996.
He was succeeded by Mr. Peter Barrand, who was stationed in Baku from January 2001 until
December 2002. Mr. Isaac Svartsman was resident advisor in the ANB for bank supervision

4
and restructuring from September 1998 to April 2001. Nataliya Ivanik took up the position of
STA regional external sector statistics advisor in November 2006.

ANNEX II: AZERBAIJAN: IMF-WORLD BANK RELATIONS
(As of April 15, 2008)
•

The World Bank has been actively involved in structural reforms, poverty reduction
measures, public expenditure management, agricultural policies, private sector
development, institution building, and governance. A range of instruments is used to
conduct the dialogue. SAC-II, which was fully disbursed in June 2003, supported a
wide-ranging structural reform agenda and its accompanying second institution
building and technical assistance credit (IBTA II) assisted institutional capacity
building, especially of the Treasury Information management System (TIMS), public
investment program preparation, and utility reforms. The Bank’s Board approved a
Poverty Reduction Support Credit (PRSC) in May 2005. By supporting the
authorities’ State Program of Poverty Reduction and Economic Development
(SPRED), the PRSC aimed to improve the business environment, the efficiency and
effectiveness of allocations in the social sectors, support anti-corruption efforts and
increased transparency and accountability of public finances.

•

The Bank’s new Country Partnership Strategy (CPS) was discussed at the World
Bank’s Board on December 7, 2006. A CPS Progress Report was prepared in April
2008. The CPS is based on a broad policy reform approach combined with sector
investment projects in agriculture, transport, water, refugees/IDPs, environment,
education, health, and energy. Analytical and advisory assistance for the next four
years includes Programmatic Poverty Assessments, Programmatic Public Expenditure
Reviews (PER), an update on the CFAA (financial accountability) and CPAR
(procurement), and ongoing work on trade facilitation and mitigation of the social
costs of utility price increases. In FY2008, the Bank, in collaboration with other
donors, plans to complete three assessments: a Public Expenditure and Financial
Accountability (PEFA) assessment, and a Country Procurement Assessment Review.
In addition, a Country Economic Memorandum (covering macroeconomic polices,
infrastructure, trade and the business environment, financial sector, and employment)
is also planned for FY2008. The Bank will continue its advisory services in the
energy sector, the health sector, and the water sector.

•

After the PRGF arrangement expired in July 2005, close collaboration between the
IMF and the World Bank has continued. The World Bank’s policy advice will
continue to focus on preparation and implementation of the medium term expenditure
framework, public expenditure management (PEFA follow up, budget processing,
and public accounting) and the business environment (including taxation issues) as
well as areas for follow-up on the basis of CEM analysis. The World Bank’s recently
expanded lending activity will continue to focus on infrastructure, education, private
sector development, and other sectoral issues, as well as some financial sector issues.
The IMF will continue to focus on macro-critical areas and tax administration, and
will collaborate with the Bank on tax policy. The World Bank and the Fund will also
share responsibilities on issues of banking and financial sector soundness. The Fund
will continue to provide advice on banking sector soundness and supervision and
systemic issues and the World Bank will provide assistance on microeconomic issues

6
that are critical to strengthen the functioning and enhance the depth of the financial
sector. The two country teams agreed to coordinate their policy advice in the financial
sector area, where overlaps are more likely.
•

The IFC’s strategy emphasizes support to the non-oil sector to help economic
diversification. To this end, the IFC will help catalyze FDI in non-oil sector projects,
which focus on exports, help generate foreign exchange earnings and contribute to the
modernization of the country’s manufacturing base and basic infrastructure. The
IFC’s strategy for the non-oil sectors involves (i) promoting competition in the
banking sector, establishing joint ventures in the non-bank financial sector, technical
assistance to private local banks for institutional capacity building; (ii) improving
access to finance through credit lines to local private banks for on-lending to small
and medium size enterprises (SMEs); (iii) enhancing the business climate and
reducing impediments to foreign investments; (iv) supporting agri-business and
agro-processing; and (v) creating conditions for private provision of public services.

ANNEX III: AZERBAIJAN’S RELATIONS WITH THE EBRD
(As of March 31, 2008)
As of March 31, 2008, the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD)
had signed 79 investments in Azerbaijan with cumulative commitments totaling
EUR725.7 million. Current Portfolio Stock equals to EUR478.2 million. The EBRD’s first
operation-the rehabilitation of Yenikend power plant, was signed in December 1994. Since
then, the pace and composition of portfolio growth has varied significantly from year to year.
During 2007, the EBRD signed 27 transactions in Azerbaijan for EUR122 million. In 2007,
the Bank provided an additional EUR 65.3 million to Azerenerji, the public power utility for
the rehabilitation of the country’s largest power generation facility, AZDRES. The EBRD
has invested additional funds in Milk-Pro, the largest diary producer in Azerbaijan. Three
more Azerbaijani commercial banks became clients of EBRD in 2007 increasing the number
of partner banks to nine. The EBRD has signed two syndicated loans under the A/B structure
for two local commercial banks. In addition, two leading non-bank microfinance institutions,
received funding from EBRD in 2007, with co-financing from the BP-led Regional
Development Initiative (RDI). A loan agreement with another non-bank microfinance
institution was signed in the second half of 2007. In 2007, the EBRD signed four projects in
agribusiness and general industries sectors under the co-financing facility and has provided
equity and debt financing to Unileasing (privately owned leasing company).
The ratio of private sector projects in the portfolio now stands at 51 percent. A new,
three-year EBRD Country Strategy for Azerbaijan was approved in September 2007. The
Strategy sets a number of objectives directed towards the development of enterprise,
financial institutions, infrastructure and energy sectors. The EBRD will contribute to the
development of the non-oil sector by making direct debt and equity investments and via
support to the financial sector. Micro-, small- and medium-sized enterprises will continue to
be the primary target for these investments using the instruments available under the ETC
Initiative. A special emphasis will be on provision of financial resources to regions outside
Baku through the banks’ expanding branch networks and providing increased support to the
agriculture sector. In the infrastructure and energy sectors, the main focus will be in
financing projects and pursuing an active policy dialogue for reforms in the transport, power,
municipal infrastructure and environmental clean-up. The EBRD is already taking the lead in
policy dialogue with the Government particularly in the power sector and will help drive key
sector reforms, legislative and regulatory changes, and attraction of the private sector.
Azerbaijan is part of the “Early Transition Countries” (ETC) initiative. Launched in April
2004, the initiative aims to increase investments in the Bank’s eight countries of operation in
the early transition stage. The initiative builds on international efforts to address poverty in
these countries. Through this initiative, the EBRD focuses its efforts on private sector
business development and selected public sector interventions. It aims to stimulate market
activity by using a streamlined approach to financing, focusing on smaller projects,
mobilizing more investment, and encouraging ongoing economic reform. The Bank will
accept higher risk in the projects it finances in the ETCs, while still respecting principles of
sound banking.

ANNEX IV. AZERBAIJAN: STATISTICAL ISSUES
1.
Economic and financial statistics provided to the Fund are broadly adequate for
surveillance purposes. Although the authorities have made significant progress in improving
the quality and timeliness of their macroeconomic statistics, a number of weaknesses should
be addressed, particularly in the areas of national accounts, price statistics, and external
sector statistics. STA has provided extensive technical assistance and recommendations in
these areas.
2.
Azerbaijan has participated in the GDDS since mid-2001. In April 2002, a data ROSC
mission reviewed Azerbaijan’s data dissemination practices against GDDS guidelines and
conducted an assessment of the quality of national accounts, consumer price index (CPI),
producer price index (PPI), government finance, monetary, and balance of payments
statistics. The data module of the ROSC is available on the IMF’s external website.
Azerbaijan nominated a national SDDS Coordinator in August 2005. An SDDS assessment
mission in April 2007 provided technical assistance on the outstanding issues required for
SDDS subscription. A data ROSC module to reassess the Consumer Price Index (CPI) took
place in February 2008.
A. Real Sector
National accounts and price statistics
3.
Under STA’s national accounts project, significant technical assistance has been
provided to the State Statistics Committee (SSC) and progress has been made in a number of
areas. Methods for compiling gross national income have been improved and revised
estimates disseminated; quarterly national account estimates at constant prices for 1998–2004
have been compiled; capital investment data have been revised; estimates of undeclared
wages have been made; and a new methodology for calculating price indices for the
construction and transportation sectors is well underway. The March/April 2005 mission
identified the following problems: (i) the Oil Fund’s transactions are not adequately reflected
in the national accounts due to lack of information from the Oil Fund; (ii) the SSC does not
have sufficient information to make reliable estimates of remittances from domestic residents
working abroad; and (iii) there are no estimates of informal sector activity.
4.
In January 2005, the CPI was revamped: the consumption basket was expanded to
cover 585 items and expenditure weights updated to reflect recent consumption patterns.
With respect to regional coverage, which is now expanded to 54 regions, the SSC used
population-based weights in the aggregation of elementary price indices. However, this
treatment raised methodological questions, because (i) international best practices suggest
the use of expenditure-based weights in every stage of aggregation in CPI compilation, and
(ii) population shares are not reliable proxies for regional expenditure shares. The recent
reassessment of the CPI found that expenditure weighting for regional aggregation has now
been implemented, but noted that expenditures on owner-occupied housing are inadequately
represented by expenditure for maintenance and repairs.

11
B. Fiscal Sector
5.
Recent treasury modernization efforts are expected to improve the compilation of
fiscal data. With the assistance of a Fund peripatetic advisor, the Ministry of Finance
developed the treasury chart of accounts (COA), an essential input to the new treasury
system. The October 2006 STA government finance statistics mission found the latest draft
COA broadly consistent with the Government Finance Statistics Manual, 2001. The work
on the COA is proceeding in parallel with the computerization of Treasury operations.
6.
The 2002 data ROSC mission recommended expanding the coverage of government
finance statistics by including all operations recorded by the treasury and publishing details
on financing and debt outstanding. Starting in 2006, the state budget incorporates transfers
to Nakhichevan as a separate expenditure item, but no further details are provided.
C. Monetary Sector
7.
The Azerbaijan National Bank (ANB) compiles monetary statistics according to the
methodology of the Monetary and Financial Statistics Manual. The ANB reports monetary
data to STA within three weeks after the end of the reference month, via Standardized
Report Forms (SRFs). Monetary and financial data have also been published in the
International Financial Statistics(IFS) Supplement since December 2006.
D. External Sector
8.
Starting in November 2006, a Regional Advisor in External Sector Statistics to
Azerbaijan and Georgia has been stationed in Baku to (i) facilitate activities carried out by
different government agencies in the development of external sector statistics; (ii) assist
with statistical capacity building; (iii) coordinate the technical assistance activities of STA
with the MCD’s work program; and (4) assist the authorities in coordinating with other
international institutions and bilateral agencies involved in technical assistance in statistics
in Azerbaijan and Georgia.
9.
While the overall structure of the balance of payments (BOP) statistics is broadly
consistent with the fifth edition of the Balance of Payments Manual, several compilation
weaknesses remain. These include (i) insufficient data on FDI stocks and flows that prompt
inadequate estimates for FDI income and impede the proper treatment of profit taxes of the
oil sector; (ii) undercoverage of nonguaranteed external debt and inconsistencies with the
relevant creditor source data; (iii) incorrect treatment of operational leases of mobile
equipment; and (iv) an inadequate breakdown between FDI equity and other capital, which
is necessary to properly record transactions associated with the Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan
Pipeline, Shah-Denis gas field, and South Caucasus Pipeline.
10.
The ANB has made steady progress toward implementing the short-term measures
recommended by the 2002 data ROSC mission. Almost all short-term measures have now
been completed: the methodology for compiling reserve assets has been revised to exclude
the Oil Fund assets, and they are now classified as other investment assets of the
government; a new survey form for oil sector enterprises (IOCs) has been designed and

12
distributed to international oil consortia; and the scope and classification of BOP statistics
have been improved. However, the data provision from IOCs remains insufficient, which
hampers the compilation of foreign direct investment estimates due to inconsistencies in
timing, coverage, and valuation of the source data.
11.
To date, significant progress has also been made in implementing the data ROSC
medium-term recommendations. Starting with data for the third quarter of 2005, the
classification of services has been expanded, and data on reinvested earnings have been
included in the BOP. The compilation system appears to be facing some operational
problems due to the lack of collaboration with other data-producing agencies, such as the
Oil Fund. Problems also remain with the sources and methods, particularly with regard to
short-term liabilities. No data are available on intercompany lending to direct investment
enterprises, and trade credit transactions are estimated on the basis of trade statistics and the
International Transactions Reporting System (ITRS) data with no clear distinction between
asset and liability transactions.
12.
The ANB has initiated compilation of the International Investment Position (IIP)
statistics, but the IIP statement is still at an evolving stage. The IIP data have been published
in the IFS since 2002.
13.
Statistics for public and publicly guaranteed external debt are reported quarterly on a
due-for-payment basis with a lag of one to two months. A debt service schedule for public
and publicly guaranteed external debt, separately identifying the principal and interest
components, is also provided with a one quarter lag. However, systematic information on
nonguaranteed external debt, including a sectoral breakdown, is lacking. The law on
external debt, which includes the assignment of responsibility for external debt compilation,
has been drafted and provided to the Parliament. On external debt, the 2005 BOP mission
noted that it would be desirable to use balance sheet data from commercial banks pertaining
to banking sector liabilities, which would permit presentation of information with a
breakdown by maturities and instruments.
14.
Monthly data on total official reserve assets and daily ANB net interventions in the
foreign exchange market are provided within 15 days of the end of each month. Data on
official reserves during the month are provided on request from Fund staff. Azerbaijan does
not disseminate International Reserves and Foreign Currency Liquidity Template data, but
the ANB and the government have stated that there have not been any forward or futures
transactions that could give rise to contingent short-term net drains on foreign currency
assets.

AZERBAIJAN: TABLE OF COMMON INDICATORS REQUIRED FOR SURVEILLANCE

Statement by the IMF Staff Representative
May 23, 2008
1.
This statement summarizes information that has become available since the Staff
Report on the Republic of Azerbaijan was circulated to the Executive Board on May 8, 2008.
The new information points to heightened risk for further rise in the already high inflation
rate, but does not change the thrust of the staff appraisal.
2.
Inflation has accelerated since the beginning of the year. The 12-month inflation rate
rose to 21.4 percent in April from 15.2 percent in January, with food inflation surging to
29.6 percent from 19.4 percent.
3.
On May 7, 2008, the President of the Republic of Azerbaijan signed into law the
supplementary budget of the central government for 2008. The revised budget indicates a
much larger fiscal expansion than the one described in the baseline scenario of the staff
report, which reflected preliminary information on government policy intentions at the time
of the mission. The authorities justified the significant budget expansion on account of higher
than previously expected oil revenue.1 The revised budget has significantly increased the
domestically financed investment expenditure, quoting higher investment costs because of
rising commodity and building material prices, and the need to accelerate the execution of
investment projects to support non-oil GDP growth. Allocations for wages, pensions and
social transfers have also been augmented to counter the impact of inflation on real incomes.
4.
Staff estimates that the 2008 supplementary budget would entail an increase in
consolidated government expenditure of 12.7 percentage points of non-oil GDP, with respect
to the staff report projections (Tables 1, 2 and 3). Non-oil revenue is now projected to be
1.7 percentage point of non-oil GDP higher, on account of higher inflation and growth. If
fully executed, the revised budget would result in a widening of the non-oil primary deficit to
50 percent of non-oil GDP, from 32 percent in 2007; the staff report projected a non-oil
primary deficit of 39 percent of non-oil GDP for 2008. The overall fiscal surplus would be
lower than previously projected by about 1.9 billion manat (5 percent of total GDP), leading
to less accumulation of oil fund assets.
5.
In the context of already binding supply constraints and an accelerating inflation
trajectory, staff expects that the additional increase in public spending will result in higher
inflation, a marginal increase in non-oil growth, and higher imports compared with the staff
report projections. With inflation now projected to rise to 26 percent at end-2008, the risk of
1

The original budget law was based on a 50 dollar per barrel average oil price for 2008. The supplementary
budget assumes an average oil price of 70 dollar per barrel. Staff’s projections, both in the staff report and in
this statement, are based on the Spring WEO oil price projection of 95.5 dollar per barrel.

2

a price-wage spiral has increased substantially. The supplementary budget will also
exacerbate the existing problems with the quality and efficiency of public expenditure due to
limited administrative and absorption capacity. In view of increasing risks to long-term
macroeconomic stability, staff now considers as critical a more cautious approach to budget
implementation in 2008 and significant fiscal adjustment in 2009 to support a credible
disinflation process. In addition, during the remainder of 2008, exchange rate and monetary
policy will need to be used proactively to avoid that the inflationary impact of the
supplementary budget gets out of control.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
July 1, 2008

International Monetary Fund
700 19th Street, NW
Washington, D. C. 20431 USA

IMF Executive Board Concludes the 2008 Article IV Consultation with
the Republic of Azerbaijan
On May 23, 2008, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded the
Article IV consultation with the Republic of Azerbaijan.1
Background
Azerbaijan’s economic growth remained strong, with real GDP expanding by 23 percent in
2007. The oil sector continued to be the main driving force, growing by 37 percent. The non-oil
sector also grew rapidly at about 12 percent, propelled mostly by non-tradable activity,
particularly construction, commerce, and communications. As a result, per capita GDP is
estimated to have exceeded US$3500, and officially reported poverty and unemployment level
declined significantly.
However, 12-month inflation accelerated to 19.5 percent at end-2007, reflecting demand
pressures from fiscal expansion, rising international food and commodity prices, increases
in administered energy and utility prices, and an accommodative monetary policy. Inflation
remained high at 21.4 percent in April 2008, despite the fact that the January 2007 adjustment
of administered prices had already been absorbed in the base. Widening inflation differentials
with Azerbaijan’s trading partners resulted in a continuation of real effective exchange rate
appreciation, clouding the growth prospect for the non-oil tradable sector.

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On
return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the
Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of
the Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to
the country's authorities. This PIN summarizes the views of the Executive Board as expressed
during the May 23, 2008 Executive Board discussion based on the staff report.

2
The oil production boom and rising international oil prices further strengthened Azerbaijan’s
external position. The current account surplus is estimated to have risen to 29 percent of GDP
in 2007, from 18 percent in 2006. Despite very large profit and investment repatriation by
foreign oil companies, the government’s oil fund assets and international reserves at the
Azerbaijan National Bank (ANB) together reached about US$7.3 billion—triple the amount of
external public sector debt outstanding at end-2007.
Fiscal policy continues to be expansionary in 2007. Total expenditure grew by 43 percent,
with wages and transfers increasing by 46 percent and investment spending rising by
63 percent. As a result, the non-oil primary deficit widened slightly to 32 percent of non-oil
GDP, despite a robust performance of non-oil revenues. The consolidated fiscal balance
returned to surplus mostly owing to a 60 percent growth in oil revenues, but also reflecting
improved tax administration. However, progress to strengthen public expenditure planning,
execution, and monitoring was limited.
The monetary policy response to the fiscal-induced overheating was insufficient. In the context
of a slowly appreciating crawling peg to the dollar, the ANB undertook large purchases of
foreign exchange from the government, leading to a doubling of manat base money in 2007.
The policy interest rate was kept negative in real terms.
In March 2008, the ANB introduced a basket peg aimed at stabilizing the nominal effective
exchange rate. The manat is now pegged to a dollar/euro currency basket, in which the
weight of the euro will gradually increase. The new arrangement and the envisaged weight
adjustments are intended to mitigate imported inflation, and as a first step towards more
nominal exchange rate flexibility.
Banks’ soundness indicators and compliance with prudential regulations improved in 2007, but
credit risks intensified amid an extraordinary credit boom. Private banks’ share in the banking
system surpassed 50 percent during the year. At end-2007, all banks met the requirements on
capital adequacy and foreign currency exposure, and the non-performing loan ratios were
lower than a year before. Meanwhile, abundant liquidity and increased foreign borrowing by
banks boosted credit growth by 97 percent, with increasing exposure to the property sector.
In general, the financial sector is still underdeveloped, providing few long-term instruments for
savers and investors.
Structural reforms to promote a competitive non-oil sector remained slow. The work to upgrade
legislations in line with World Trade Organization (WTO) accession requirements is under way.
The one-stop facility for business registration is now operational, facilitating the establishment
of new companies. Licensing requirements, though, remain heavy and governance issues—
particularly in customs—are perceived as major impediments. Parliamentary approval of
important bills to strengthen governance and the business environment (e.g. anti-monopoly,
investment and Anti-Money Laundering/Combating the Financing of Terrorism laws) has been
pending for more than a year.
The short-term growth and external outlook remains strong, but high inflation is here to stay
under the current policy stance. Real GDP is projected to grow by 19 percent on the strength

3
of higher oil production. Non-oil growth—driven by large public expenditure—would moderate
to a still high 10 percent. The current account surplus would rise to 36 percent of GDP on
higher oil export volumes and prices. Oil fund assets and international reserves are projected
to more than triple from the end-2007 level, to reach US$24 billion at end 2008. However, the
continuation of the fiscal expansion would fuel domestic demand growth and inflation would
stay high in 2008.
Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors welcomed the impressive growth performance over the past three years,
the rapidly improving living standards and declining poverty, and the generally favorable
medium-term economic prospects. Directors agreed that the current oil boom holds the
promise of modernizing Azerbaijan’s economy, but cautioned that sustainable improvements
in economic conditions require cautious management. They were concerned about the
acceleration of inflation associated with the current expansionary policies, and called on the
authorities to adjust promptly macroeconomic policies to prevent high inflation expectations
from becoming entrenched.
Directors agreed that fiscal policy should shoulder most of the burden of adjustment to
help reverse high inflation expectations and stifle the emerging wage-price spiral. While
acknowledging the need for investments in infrastructure and human capital to promote nonoil
sector growth and reduce poverty over the medium term, Directors underscored the need to
moderate the planned fiscal expansion for 2008 and to embark on fiscal tightening from 2009
to contain aggregate demand, focusing on reducing the pace of expenditure increases. They
were concerned that the recent adoption of a sizeable supplementary budget would add to the
inflation risk.
Directors emphasized the importance of increasing the effectiveness of public spending. They
observed that expenditure moderation would help address the government’s concern about
the quality and efficiency of public investment. Effective institutional mechanisms need to be
established to ensure proper planning, execution, and monitoring of public projects. Directors
called on the authorities to adopt a comprehensive medium-term expenditure framework in the
context of the 2009 budget that reflects transparently the government’s priorities and that
evaluates the costs and benefits of projects and their recurrent maintenance costs.
Directors noted the role of monetary and exchange rate policies in preventing inflation from
spiraling upward. They welcomed the authorities’ intention to move toward a more flexible
exchange rate system over time and the recent adoption of the two-currency basket peg—a
step that supports the necessary development of the domestic foreign exchange market.
Directors encouraged the Azerbaijan National Bank (ANB) to use exchange rate policy more
actively to ward off imported inflation, and to allow the manat to appreciate somewhat against
the basket.
Directors agreed that the exceptionally fast credit growth observed in the past few years
entails substantial risks that may not have yet manifested themselves in the traditional banking
soundness indicators. They welcomed the prudential measures recently adopted by the ANB

4
to strengthen banking regulation and supervision, and encouraged it to monitor the situation
closely, take additional steps when necessary, and implement the prudential regulations
forcefully across the banking system.
Directors underscored the importance of developing further the financial system to facilitate
the growth of the non-oil economy. They took note of the renewed initiatives to privatize the
state-owned banks, and encouraged the authorities to follow international best practices and
complete the process transparently. They recommended consolidating the banking system
further, while attracting established foreign banks to promote competition and increase
efficiency. Directors encouraged the authorities to develop other sectors of the financial
system, including the bond, insurance, and private pension market, to provide additional
financing channels, investment vehicles, and savings instruments.
Directors considered a coherent structural reform agenda to be a critical component for
supporting non-oil growth over the medium term. They called on the authorities to intensify
efforts to strengthen corporate governance of the largest state-owned enterprises, remove
obstacles to competition to increase the supply response of the economy, and implement
anti-corruption programs. They welcomed the introduction of a one-stop facility for business
registration, and called for a reduction in licensing requirements. They encouraged the
authorities to proceed with reforming customs legislation and administration in line with
WTO rules.

Statement by Thomas Moser, Executive Director for Republic of Azerbaijan
and Martin Lanz, Advisor to Executive Director
May 23, 2008
1.
On behalf of our Azerbaijan authorities, we would like to thank the staff for the
constructive discussions and the candid staff report. In these for Azerbaijan exciting but
challenging times, the staff’s policy advice provides valuable input to the authorities’ efforts
to address the population’s manifold expectations. The authorities are committed to preserve
macroeconomic stability and agree that, going forward, fiscal moderation will be needed.
Managing a sudden surge in oil wealth, however, is and remains a challenging balancing act.
2.
Azerbaijan has experienced spectacular growth during the recent years, with GDP per
capita more than doubling over the last three years alone. The authorities are determined to
use this unique opportunity for the rapid development of the country and to make fast
progress in the living standards of the population. Given the still large needs and expectations
of the population, the authorities have scaled up development spending. Not only
infrastructure, but also such sectors as health and education are receiving necessary increases
in funding.
3.
The authorities are fully aware of the macroeconomic challenges that the oil boom
creates. In 1999, in anticipation of the oil boom, the State Oil Fund of the Republic of
Azerbaijan (SOFAZ) was established to save energy-related windfalls both for future
generations and to avoid excessive spending. In 2003, the government established a
Committee on Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI) to implement its
obligations under the initiative, and Azerbaijan has since then published annual and semi
annual EITI reports. The authorities have also made significant improvements in increasing
non-oil revenues and are putting policies in place to support the development of mediumsized companies and the diversification of the economy.
4.
The authorities are also aware that the rapid scaling up of public expenditure is testing
the absorptive capacity of the country. They agree that the quality of public investment is
crucial and are committed to improve project selection and monitoring to avoid wasteful,
inflationary spending. The government is building up domestic capacity to conduct costbenefit analysis for project proposals, and the adoption of IFRS accounting starting in 2008
will enhance the transparency of SOEs’ operations and their financial discipline.
5.
Rising food prices and energy price increases are contributing to the inflationary
pressures. In March, the authorities replaced the crawling peg to the US dollar with a peg to a
dollar/euro currency basket, whereby the weight of the euro will be adjusted in light of
experience with the basket arrangement. Moreover, in April the National Bank of Azerbaijan
(NBA) raised the refinancing rate by 1 percentage point to 14 percent. Both measures should
help to contain inflation. Moreover, the introduction of a new system which requires VAT

2
taxpayers to maintain a sub-account with the ANB is expected to raise VAT collection above
projections and should thus have a cooling effect on aggregate demand. The establishment of
a macroeconomic coordination committee with the aim to improve policy coordination is
also expected to help preserve macroeconomic stability.
6.
Our Azerbaijan authorities consider the development and strengthening of the
financial sector a priority. Azerbaijan’s banking sector has grown substantially over the last
years, with private banks now accounting for a larger share of total assets than state-owned
banks. Soundness indicators and compliance with prudential regulations have improved in
2007, and the ANB is taking several measures to contain the risks stemming from high credit
growth.
7.
Measures on the structural front to develop entrepreneurship and improve the
business environment are expected to boost competitiveness. The organization of
entrepreneurship under the “one window” principle, loans given to investment projects of
entrepreneurs by the National Fund on Support of Entrepreneurship, and preferential loans to
farmers play a significant role in the development of the private sector. The establishment of
special economic zones is also one of the major initiatives of state support to
entrepreneurship. Efforts are made to create the first industrial city, business incubators and a
network of business centers in the country to establish a market infrastructure of
entrepreneurship. A new State Program is expected to be adopted that will cover the state
policy on the development of entrepreneurship and the methods of its implementation. The
Program will cover 2008-2013. WTO accession is now a top priority of the government of
Azerbaijan, and the harmonization of legislation with WTO rules is expected to provide
additional impetus to the efforts to improve the business environment.
8.
The authorities would finally like to thank the Fund for the recently concluded CPI
ROSC mission. Concerns about the CPI methodology have repeatedly been the subject of
discussions between the authorities and stakeholders in past years. The authorities are
currently studying the draft ROSC paper, but they appreciate the preliminary finding that
there are no issues with their CPI methodology. Of course, the authorities will be keen on
further improving their assessments of prices, based on the finding of the report.
