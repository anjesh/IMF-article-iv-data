STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2012 ARTICLE IV CONSULTATION
January 16, 2013

KEY ISSUES
Background: Activity is slowly recovering after a cumulative decline of about 5 percent
during 2008–10. Expansionary fiscal policies—largely to counteract the impact of the
global slowdown and the two successive natural disasters—led to a deterioration in
fiscal balances, with public debt up by about 10½ percent of GDP over this period. The
fiscal deficit, however, is expected to narrow this year, largely reflecting cuts in capital
spending. In the financial sector, non performing loans remain above prudential
guidelines; provisioning and profitability are low; and supervision remains weak.
Policy Challenges: Further fiscal consolidation—including by rebalancing government
expenditure toward growth and employment generating public sector projects—is
required to ensure medium-term sustained growth as well as keep public sector debt on
a downward trajectory. In this regard, improving the efficiency of revenue collection and
reducing current spending—especially on the wage bill, which is high relative to
revenues—will be crucial to allow the government to maneuver fiscal policy. Financial
sector weaknesses also need to be addressed, including through strengthening of
supervisory and regulatory standards, to promote effective financial intermediation that
supports private sector growth. Structural reforms, including infrastructure
enhancements and labor market reforms are critical to improve competitiveness and
ensure medium-term growth and current account sustainability.

The Fund provided two consecutive disbursements under the Rapid Credit Facility in 2011 to help mitigate the
impact of the natural disasters. The Caribbean Development Bank, the World Bank, and other donors have also
provided funds to help improve the country’s resilience to natural disasters. Many of these projects have commenced

(17½ percent of 1999 GDP) for the construction of the Ottley Hall shipyard (a yacht repair facility). However, the
project later failed and in 2007, the government secured a debt cancellation in an amount of EC$150.8 million from
the government of Italy.

Box 1. The Authorities’ Progress with Building Climate Resilience
There are ongoing efforts to rehabilitate vulnerable public buildings and damaged
infrastructure caused by the hurricane. Damaged infrastructure, including roads, schools, community
centers, water ways, and bridges, are under repair and reconstruction, and these projects are being
undertaken under the Public Sector Investment Program (PSIP). Similarly, emergency shelters are being
retrofitted—this is required for more than half of the 100 buildings identified to prepare them for use
during emergencies. Project activities also involve strengthening river defenses and building
warehouses to store emergency relief materials.
A comprehensive approach to disaster vulnerability reduction will take off in the medium term.
Supported by the World Bank, a major ongoing project—the Disaster Vulnerability Reduction Project
(DVRP)—aims to measurably reduce the country’s vulnerability to adverse natural events, including
climate change. This is a region-wide initiative, which complements the ongoing efforts of the
government and other donors. It includes comprehensive interventions in disaster risk reduction
measures – preventative maintenance, climate change adaption, appropriate zoning, hazard mapping,
land use planning, and a disaster information system.
The authorities have started implementing the new national building regulations. This
commenced in late 2011 to ensure that new buildings are constructed to higher standards. Under the
new building codes and guidelines, the authorities will conduct inspections at different phases of
building construction and issue a certificate of occupancy upon completion. However, enforcement of
the regulations is weak owing to insufficient manpower for monitoring.
Additional investments would be needed to further enhance disaster risk management.
Discussions with the authorities revealed that in addition to ongoing efforts, the country needs an early
warning or seismic monitoring system to boost emergency preparedness. The national emergency
agency is hampered by the reliance on the periodic tsunami watch alerts issued by the Pacific Tsunami
Warning Centre (PTWC) located in the US, to make a national warning and evacuation call in the event
of a hurricane.
The authorities agreed with staff on the importance of having a contingency fund to build
buffers against exogenous shocks. However, they argued that setting up such a fund will not be
feasible now given the limited fiscal space and the need to meet developmental priorities on
infrastructure, and in the education and health sector.

3.
Deterioration in the competitiveness of
tourism and exports and increased
construction-related imports have led to a
sustained widening of the current account deficit
over the last decade. Declines in tourism and
export receipts and high commodity prices have
contributed to keep the current account deficit high
despite weak aggregate demand. The deficit has so
far been financed mainly by FDI and official capital
flows (capital grants and disbursements).

BACKGROUND
4.
The economy is showing signs of recovery, but at a slower pace than expected last
year. After three consecutive years of negative growth, real GDP grew by about ½ percent in 2011.
Economic activity indicators for the first six months of 2012 suggest a modest pick-up in tourism
arrivals, manufacturing, and agricultural activity. However, delays in public sector capital projects, in
part reflecting cash constraints, and weak private sector credit growth continue to act as a drag on
growth.

Inflation has moderated in recent
months. The pressure from international food and
fuel prices led to an increase in inflation last year
with end-period and average headline inflation
peaking at 4.7 percent and 3.2 percent,
respectively, in December 2011.4 However, the
decline in international prices since then has
helped to ease inflation with end-period inflation
declining to 0.3 percent by October this year.

6.
The fiscal deficit is expected to narrow this year. Based on data through the first
10 months of the year, the overall fiscal deficit is expected to be around 2¾ percent of GDP, lower
by about a percentage point of GDP compared to last year. Revenues have been lower than
projected due to both the sluggish recovery as well as an apparent decline in tax compliance.
Spending on the wage bill is expected to be somewhat higher given the recent announcement of a
retroactive wage increase of 1½ percent for civil service workers for 2011 and 2012. As has been the
case in recent years, cash flow constraints are being met by cuts in capital spending and some
accumulation of domestic arrears.5 Earlier in the year, the government issued an EC$40 million
10−year bond on the Regional Government Securities Market (RGSM) to help finance the deficit.6
7.
The 2012 current account deficit is expected to improve marginally by one percentage
points of GDP to 27.8 percent compared to 2011. Preliminary estimates for the first eight months
of 2012 suggest that there was a modest rebound in agricultural exports as well as an increase in
manufacturing exports. However, imports were also up more than expected, driven largely by FDIrelated imports as well as imports of fuel and construction materials for the international airport
project.

4

This also includes the increase in telecommunication prices last year.

5

The expected sale of government shares in the Bank of St. Vincent was not realized due to technical problems and
is now planned for next year.
6

This was in line with the plan at the time of the budget. The coupon rate was 7.5 percent. Meanwhile, coupon rates
on 91-day T-bills have declined from an average of 4¼ percent last year to 3¼ percent in recent months.

8.
Private sector credit growth remains sluggish, with a slight uptick in recent months.
Since the crisis, private sector credit growth has been in the range of 2–4 percent (y/y, nominal
terms). While this reflects a tightening of lending standards by banks in the wake of the financial
crisis and slowdown in growth which have led to high NPLs and reduced profitability, banks also
indicated a lack of demand from the business sector.7 Most of the new loans have been mortgages
as these are perceived to be less risky because they are backed by collateral.
9.


Weak growth has also affected the performance of the financial sector.
Non-performing loans (NPLs) at banks remain in the 7–7½ percent range, almost twice
their pre-crisis level.8 The size of NPLs varies across banks, ranging from 5–15 percent. Bank
profitability has declined significantly since 2009. While capital adequacy ratios are relatively
high at around 20 percent, inadequate provisioning against NPLs (around 30 percent) calls for
caution in interpreting these ratios.



The balance sheets of non-bank financial institutions continue to remain under stress.9
Average NPLs at credit unions are similar to those at banks, and profitability remains low.
Available data on NPLs at the Building and Loan (B&L) association indicate that half of its loan
portfolio was overdue in 2011. Although exposures to the two failed insurance companies— the
British American Insurance Company (BAICO) and the Colonial Life Insurance Company
(CLICO)— were partly written off in 2011 by two credit unions and the B&L association, a
considerable amount still remains on their books (6 percent and 2.7 percent of their assets,
respectively). It is estimated that the B&L association would need considerable additional capital
to achieve the minimum capital adequacy ratio of 10 percent of total assets.

7

This is not to say that banks do not get requests for loans from the business sector, but many of these are not
backed by sound cash flow projections or a viable business plan.
8

The ECCU’s operational guideline is for NPLs not to exceed 5 percent. All the banks are foreign owned, with the
government holding a 40 percent share in the Bank of St. Vincent.
9

The non-bank financial sector includes credit unions, the B&L association, insurance companies, and a small
offshore sector. Assets of credit unions and the B&L association are around 13 percent of GDP each.



Progress is being made to resolve the fallout from the BAICO/CLICO. Last year, the Medical
Support Fund was established to address the needs of BAICO’s medical policyholders.
Negotiations for selling BAICO’s life insurance portfolio to a regional insurance company are
well advanced. Most recently, it was announced that BAICO and CLICO annuity holders will start
receiving partial payments before the end of 2012. 10

10.
Policy reform measures, in line with the commitments at the time of the two Rapid
Credit Facility requests in 2011, are being implemented. Regarding fiscal measures, the Large
Taxpayers Unit (LTU) is functioning although further strengthening is needed and a market-based
property tax is expected to be implemented starting next year. However, the wage bill will not
decline as had been expected given the recent agreement to grant a wage increase of 1½ percent
retroactively from 2011. That said, this is half of the agreed increase during the last wage
negotiation. Little progress has been made in setting up a framework for monitoring state-owned
enterprises (SOEs), although data collection on their financial operations has improved (see Annex
III). In the financial sector, the Financial Services Authority (FSA), which will supervise the nonbanking sector, was officially launched in mid-November.

OUTLOOK AND RISKS
11.
The near-term outlook remains challenging, but a gradual recovery is expected over
the medium term. Real GDP growth is expected to be around ½ percent this year, as weak
construction activity partly offsets modest upticks in manufacturing and tourism. Growth is expected
to improve over the medium term, albeit gradually, on the back of projected improvements in
economic activity in advanced economies and the expected completion of the international airport
in the next 12–18 months, which is expected to boost tourism. The recent opening of two medical
universities is also expected to contribute importantly to growth over time. Inflation is expected to
return to its historical average of around 2½ percent, as international commodity prices moderate in
line with WEO baseline projections.
12.
The authorities agreed with the baseline growth projections, but saw significant
upside potential from the completion of the international airport. While the authorities agreed
that near-term growth prospects will remain subdued, especially in light of the external
environment, they were optimistic that the international airport would boost economic activity, both
directly by making the country more accessible for tourists but equally importantly by attracting
more FDI in the tourism sector, especially in the hotel industry. In this context, they noted that land
sales had already improved in anticipation of the airport and several foreign investors had indicated
plans to expand their existing investments. In addition, the domestic private sector would also get a
boost by providing support services.

10

Money will be distributed at different stages with annuity holders under EC$30,000 to be compensated first (by
Christmas) followed by annuity holders with higher investments. It is not clear at this time to what extent institutional
annuity holders will be paid.

8

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

ST. VINCENT AND THE GRENADINES

13.
Risks to the outlook, however, remain on the downside. External risks arise from
continued uncertainties about the global economic environment, including a further intensification
of the European debt crisis, which could jeopardize the expected recovery in tourism and FDI
assumed in the baseline (see Annex I). Higher food and fuel prices are also a major source of
external risk and could undermine growth through their impact on inflation and the current account.
In the financial sector, weaknesses in domestic non-banks and spillover effects from weaknesses
elsewhere in the regional financial sector could undermine confidence. In addition, contingent
liabilities from the weak financial sector and weakly monitored SOEs could disrupt fiscal
consolidation. A delay in the completion of the airport project could also dampen medium-term
growth prospects. Finally, potential natural disasters are a perennial threat to economic stability.

POLICY ISSUES AND RECOMMENDATIONS
14.
Against this background, discussions focused on reform measures to improve growth
prospects while continuing to reduce debt and enhance the country’s resilience to exogenous
shocks. Given the constraints of operating within the currency board arrangement, discussions
focused on three principal areas: (i) tax and expenditure measures that could enhance revenues,
improve the efficiency of government spending, and rebalance spending toward growth-supporting
capital projects; (ii) strengthening financial sector supervision to restore confidence in the financial
sector and enhance financial intermediation; and (ii) structural reforms to improve competitiveness
and encourage private sector-led growth.

A. Fiscal Policy: Continuing Fiscal Consolidation While Supporting Growth
15.
Staff and the authorities agreed that a credible medium-term fiscal framework would
help to ensure that debt remains on a downward trajectory while supporting growth. To date,
shortfalls in revenues and lower-than-expected donor flows have largely been offset by cuts in
capital expenditures, which have declined from about 7 percent of GDP in 2008 to under 4 percent
of GDP in 2011. This has led to unplanned delays in many priority projects including rehabilitation
and maintenance of basic infrastructure like roads and bridges. Over the same period, the wage bill
has increased from 11 percent of GDP to about 12½ percent of GDP: almost 50 percent of revenues
are now going toward the wage bill, compared to an average of about 40 percent in the rest of the
ECCU. Social expenditures have doubled, in part to help mitigate the impact of the recession and the
natural disasters, but also because of possible overlaps in coverage. In this context, the authorities
agreed that fiscal adjustment is necessary to ensure debt sustainability over the medium term. They
also agreed with staff on the need for a strong medium-term fiscal framework with multi-year
projections to promote a stable fiscal management and ensure that fiscal consolidation measures
are implemented as planned. In the near term, however, the authorities signaled that given the
recent exogenous shocks adjustments in the fiscal framework will have to be modest.
16.
Preliminary discussions on the 2013 budget indicate that the fiscal stance will remain
largely unchanged. At the time of the mission, the budget was still under discussion. Staff
projections suggest that modest adjustments in current expenditure will be offset by a projected

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

ST. VINCENT AND THE GRENADINES

increase in capital expenditure.11 The overall fiscal deficit is expected to remain broadly the same as
in 2012. Financing is expected to come from external sources, including the CDB and the EU, as well
as domestic financing from the sale of government shares in the Bank of St Vincent.
17.
Going forward, staff emphasized that efforts would have to focus on raising revenues
and cutting current expenditure. Toward this end, staff discussed a menu of options for the
medium term, which could yield up to 4½ percent of GDP in additional revenues and expenditure
cuts. This would make room for higher capital expenditures while putting public sector debt on a
sustainable path.

18.
On the revenue side, authorities shared staff’s views on the need to close tax
loopholes, strengthen administrative capacity, and improve tax compliance. More specifically:


Eliminating discretionary exemptions: Pervasive granting of non-legislated discretionary
concessions has contributed to the recent decline in corporate income tax and VAT revenues (by
as much as 2 percent of GDP). In addition, ad hoc exemptions at customs have almost doubled
between 2008 and 2011. The authorities agreed that there was scope to reduce tax exemptions
and pointed out that they were already working on proposals to streamline these exemptions,
with the exception of those transparently given to religious organizations.

11

The authorities’ preliminary budgeted capital spending was much higher than staff projections, which are
estimated based on financing availability and historical budget execution rates.

10

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

ST. VINCENT AND THE GRENADINES



Improving compliance and enforcing tax laws: A recent CARTAC mission found that tax
compliance has declined by about 20 percentage points since 2008 to the current estimated
level of 65 percent. This reflects several factors, including lax enforcement of tax laws, weak
auditing capacity at the Inland Revenue Department (IRD), and lack of progress in establishing
post-clearance auditing and risk management at the Customs and Excises Department (CED).
This has also resulted in a significant build up of tax arrears, including VAT arrears (estimated at
about 1½ percent of GDP as of September 2012). Moreover, the property tax legislation passed
last year has yet to be implemented. That said, preparations are underway to implement the
property tax starting in 2013. The authorities also expressed concern about the weak auditing
capacity and noted that enhancing capacity is critical to ensure tax compliance as well as further
strengthening of the LTU. With this in mind, they are seeking further assistance from CARTAC,
both in the form of TA and training.12 Finally, in line with previous CARTAC recommendations,
the CED plans to implement risk based assessment and post-clearance audits, and an IRD-CED
auditing team has been established to reconcile customs declarations for imports with VAT
refund applications.

19.
The authorities agreed in principle that current expenditures need to be contained to
finance growth-enhancing capital projects and reduce debt, but pointed out that gains would
be limited. The following areas were discussed:


Containing the wage bill: Staff recommended freezing employment and limiting wage increases
in the short term and undertaking comprehensive civil service reforms over the medium term to
contain the wage bill and improve the efficiency of the public sector, including through attrition,
better reallocation and coordination of jobs and staff skills, and establishing performance-based
salary increases. While the authorities acknowledged that the wage bill is high relative to
revenues, they noted that staff-recommended savings over the medium term are unlikely to be
achievable given their planned emphasis on expanding education and health services. They
indicated that any meaningful gains in the wage bill could only come from comprehensive civil
service reforms, on which they agreed to explore TA from possible donors.



Limiting transfers to SOEs: On the backdrop of the recent increases in transfers and subsidies,
partly reflecting the hiving off of a number of new SOEs out of central government
departments,13 the mission urged the authorities to limit transfers and to put in place a
time−bound action plan for sustainable financing schemes to preclude these agencies from
becoming a burden on the budget. Staff also cautioned the authorities against the proliferation

of total funding, and prevents the government from keeping track of total wages. The mission

minimize contingent liabilities to the government, and contain potential fiscal risks (see Annex
III). The authorities broadly agreed with the staff assessment and the need for streamlining
transfers and ensuring that operational costs are minimized. Furthermore, they noted that
transfers have been cut in a few cases recently and further streamlining is envisaged, although it
is difficult in some cases where SOEs provide non-marketable public goods like roads.


Targeting social safety nets: Given the large number of social assistance programs, staff
reiterated the need to move to a central registry system, consolidate social assistance programs
where possible and encouraged the authorities to improve targeting, including through
means−testing. The authorities recognized the importance of putting in place a central registry
system and indicated that plans are underway on this front. Meanwhile, the ministries are
working together to avoid duplication of service and ensure that beneficiaries are well targeted.



Pension reforms: The mission welcomed the authorities’ plans to undertake parametric reforms
of the National Insurance Service (NIS) pension system (Box 2). It also urged the authorities to
reform the public service pension system to ease the burden on public finances, including by
merging it with the NIS. On the latter, the authorities argued that past efforts had not been
successful and for the time being they planned to focus on the planned parametric reforms of
the NIS pension system.14



Investing in human capital and infrastructure: The mission encouraged the authorities to improve
cost recovery for education and health services, while ensuring that the poor and vulnerable
groups are not affected. Savings from these measures could be used to improve access to and
quality of health and education services by training teachers and health workers, building new
schools and health centers, and ensuring that medical supplies are available. The mission also
stressed the need to reallocate resources into priority infrastructure projects, which are
necessary to spur growth, including enhancing the road network (especially in rural areas),
improving port facilities, and exploring alternative energy sources. The authorities indicated that
cash constraints combined with their desire to limit debt had constrained spending on capital
projects; and going forward a rebalancing of spending to focus on these areas was required.
That said, expediting existing donor-financed projects in the education and health sectors as
well as infrastructure projects, especially those financed by the CDB and WB, remain key
priorities in the near term.



Improving cash management and strengthening commitment controls: The authorities shared
staff’s views that weaknesses in cash management and commitment controls need to be
addressed to strengthen budget transparency and accountability and minimize payments
arrears. In this respect, they noted that, in line with SEMCAR15 recommendations, they plan to

put in place measures to ensure that purchase orders are approved only after due check of
funds availability and to impose penalties for non-compliance.

Box 2. Pension Reform
The National Insurance Service (NIS), a state-owned pension company, is facing long term
sustainability challenges. The recently completed eighth actuarial review indicates that under the existing
parameters—8 percent contribution rate, 60 year retirement age, and 60 percent replacement rate—the NIS
could face sustainability issues, especially given the increasing rate of unemployment and high outward
migration of the working age population. In particular, it is estimated that contribution income will not be
sufficient to cover total expenditures starting from 2015; the reserve fund would need to be tapped to
finance expenses starting from 2025; and the reserves are expected to be depleted by 2036.
The government is considering a number of reform options. Based on the recommendations of the
actuarial review, the authorities are considering a number of options to make the NIS sustainable. These
measures, which are expected to be implemented gradually starting in 2014, include: (i) increasing the
minimum years of service for eligibility to a full pension from 10 years to 15 years; (ii) increasing the
retirement age to 65 years; (iii) increasing the contribution rate over the next few years to 12 percent.
Assuming that (i) and (ii) are fully in place by 2028 and (iii) is implemented over the next four years, the
contribution income would continue to cover expenses up to 2034 and the reserve fund ratio will be
increased up to 13 years.
Despite increasingly becoming a burden on public finances, reforming the Public Service (PS) pension
system is not on the agenda yet. The PS pension system is a non-contributory scheme for eligible public
servants, on top of their NIS pension, with a replacement rate of up to 66⅔ percent and a minimum
retirement age of 55 years. The central government carries the full burden of the costs, which consumes
about 10 percent of total revenues each year. While there is an ongoing study with the support of the
International Labor Organization on reform options of the PS pension system, discussions with the
authorities and the opposition party leaders indicate that significant changes to the system are not politically
feasible. In fact, the system was closed for new entrants in 1992 only to be repealed and retroactively
implemented in 1998 due to political pressure. To make it sustainable and reduce its burdens on public
finances, the PS system would need to be contributory and fully funded.
_________________________
1/

The mission was able to obtain only a brief summary of the results of the actuarial review and proposed measures since the full
report was not readily available.

20.
The authorities reiterated their commitment to generate primary surpluses over the
medium term to bring down public sector debt below the ECCB’s target of 60 percent of GDP
by 2020. In light of the authorities’ willingness to implement the revenue measures (paragraph 18)
but their doubts about the feasibility of a significant reduction in current expenditure (paragraph
19), the baseline scenario assumes implementation of the revenue-enhancing measures discussed
above but with only limited adjustment on the expenditure side. This could generate primary
surpluses in the range of 1 percent of GDP over the medium term, sufficient only to achieve the
ECCB debt-to-GDP target of 60 percent by 2020. Staff argued that a more rapid decline in the debtto-GDP ratio, in line with the scenario in last year’s Article IV consultation, is warranted given the
high vulnerability to exogenous shocks. The authorities indicated that they aim to be more

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

13

ST. VINCENT AND THE GRENADINES

ambitious over the medium term in terms of streamlining current expenditures and generating
primary surpluses in the range of 1½ to 2 percent of GDP.
21.
The mission urged the authorities to continue their cautious approach to borrowing
and further improve debt management. In line with their commitments at the time of the RCF
request and again during the last Article IV Consultation, the authorities have so far shown restraint
in borrowing on commercial terms and relied principally on grants and concessional resources from
multilateral institutions. Financing shortfalls have been offset largely by cuts in capital spending
despite favorable terms on the RGSM. However, efforts are underway to mobilize commercial
borrowing (long-term loan) to expedite the completion of the airport project.16 Nevertheless, staff
urged the authorities to ensure that such borrowing does not jeopardize their fiscal and debt
sustainability objectives.
22.
The Debt Sustainability Analysis (DSA) indicates that St. Vincent and the Grenadines’
risk of external debt distress remains moderate. The baseline scenario sketched above assumes
commercial borrowing of about 3 percent of

spending, reduce debt, and build buffers

16

Despite earlier reservations by staff, the authorities have pushed ahead with this project at a total cost of
US$250 million (35 percent of GDP). About two-thirds of the project has been completed, and so far the bulk of
financing has come from grants and concessional loans (Cuba, Taiwan POC, and Venezuela), and land sales. To
expedite the completion of the project, the authorities are now planning to borrow EC$60 million (around 3 percent
of GDP) on commercial terms. The departure tax (airport service charge) is expected to be raised from EC$20 to
EC$50 per traveler to help service this debt.

14

ST. VINCENT AND THE GRENADINES

Box 3. Active Scenario: Additional Expenditure Measures
Reflecting the authorities’ concerns about the feasibility of a significant reduction of current expenditures in
the medium term, the baseline scenario assumes only partial realization (less than half) of staffrecommended medium-term savings. As a result, capital expenditure is projected to remain around
4 percent of GDP, well below the pre-crisis level. This limits the potential output growth to 3 percent.
The active scenario, which incorporates all of staff-recommended measures, would generate central
government primary surpluses of around 2 percent of GDP by 2017, compared to around 1 percent in the
baseline scenario. In addition, savings from current spending can be used to boost capital expenditure up to
6 percent of GDP. This will improve the medium-term growth prospects, raising the potential output growth
to 3½ percent in the medium term.
Another assumption of the active scenario is on financing of the airport project. The baseline scenario
assumes commercial borrowing of around 3 percent of GDP to expedite the completion of the project.
However, staff advised against borrowing on commercial terms and encouraged the authorities to explore
external grants, selling assets, and concessional financing. Hence, the active scenario assumes no
commercial borrowing, with a quarter of the financing gap coming from concessional borrowing and the
remaining equally split between external grants and asset sales.
These measures will help to reduce the public sector debt to around 52½ percent of GDP by 2020 through
the direct impact of limited borrowing by the airport project and the growth impact of the additional
infrastructure investment. In addition to solidifying the sustainability of the public sector debt, this will open
up fiscal space to start building buffers against future shocks.

B. Containing Risks and Reducing Vulnerability in the Financial System
23.
The authorities were in broad agreement with staff that vulnerabilities in the financial
sector need to be addressed expeditiously through improvements in regulation and
supervision. Since 2008, financial sector balance sheets in the ECCU region have deteriorated
significantly with some institutions more affected than others. While the slowdown in the individual
economies and regional factors like the failure of BAICO/CLICO explain part of this deterioration,
weak regulations and supervision also had a role to play. Therefore, there is an overriding need to
strengthen legislation and supervision to ensure that the financial sector remains resilient.
Discussions focused on the need to address these weaknesses expeditiously, both for banks and
non-banks.
Banking sector
24.
The authorities agreed with staff on the importance of implementing the
recommendations of the joint Financial Sector Task Force (FSTF) in order to strengthen bank
supervision. The banking sector is supervised by the ECCB, although licensing of banks is done by
the individual Ministries of Finance in each country. While noting that all four commercial banks are
now majority foreign-owned, staff expressed concerns that NPLs at most banks continued to remain
above the ECCU prudential guidelines and provisioning and profitability have declined sharply since
2009. Moreover, an intensification of financial sector problems in other jurisdictions could have

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

15

ST. VINCENT AND THE GRENADINES

spillover effects, especially by derailing confidence. In this context, staff emphasized the role that the
authorities can play through the Monetary Council to ensure that the recommendations of the joint
FSTF are implemented. In particular, staff emphasized the need to update the current legal and
regulatory framework, including loan classifications and provisioning requirements, define triggers
for prompt corrective action by supervisors, and establish a region-wide deposit insurance scheme
and crisis management framework. While aware of spillover risks, the authorities recognized the
need to improve bank supervision and indicated that the ECCB and the Monetary Council are
working jointly to ensure that the recommendations of the FSTF are implemented, as rapidly as
feasible.
Non-bank financial sector
25.
Staff emphasized the urgency of addressing weaknesses and improving supervision of
this sector. As noted above, NPLs at credit unions are in the 7–8 percent range and profitability is
low. The B&L association faces a significant capital shortfall with half its loan portfolio
non-performing. Although most of its loan portfolio is backed by collateral, the latter is quite illiquid
given current market conditions. Moreover, these institutions have much narrower interest margins
on their loans given the ECCB floor on the saving rate and the need to compete against commercial
banks. Also, due to the membership nature of these institutions and the lax supervision, some of
these institutions have continued to pay dividends even in years when there were losses, thereby
deteriorating their position even further.
26.
The authorities noted that the establishment of the FSA and legislative updates are
expected to improve significantly the supervision of this sector. The FSA, which started
operations in mid-November, is now in charge of regulating and supervising money remitters,
building societies, insurers and insurance intermediaries, and credit unions.17 The FSA Act empowers
the FSA, among other things, to give directives to ensure compliance, suspend or cancel licenses,
seize the management, reorganize or wind up and exempt any non-bank financial entity. The
authorities also noted that the Harmonized Cooperatives Societies Act has been passed and the
Insurance and Mutual Funds Acts have been modernized. A new Building Societies Act is currently
under consideration. Meanwhile, the World Bank is providing technical assistance to help the B&L
association strengthen its balance sheet. The FSA is also seeking technical assistance from CARTAC
to help build supervisory capacity.

C. Sustaining Growth and Improving Competitiveness
27.
St. Vincent and the Grenadines’ external competitiveness has deteriorated over the
last decade, with staff analysis suggesting that the current account deficit is excessive and the
real exchange rate overvalued (Annex II). These large current account deficits underscore the
need to improve external competitiveness and reduce reliance on imports. While real effective
17

The FSA is currently staffed with 7 people (expected to increase to 14 in the future) and is financed by the
government though it is expected to be self-financed in the long run.

16

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

ST. VINCENT AND THE GRENADINES

exchange rate indices have depreciated since 2008, this has not been enough to stem the decline in
competitiveness. An assessment of the real effective exchange rate using methodologies based on
CGER analysis suggests an overvaluation ranging from 2 to 20 percent,18 with the sizable projected
current account deficit leading to further accumulation of already large net external liabilities.
Assessment of the underlying causes of weaknesses in competitiveness points to structural factors
(Figure 1). In particular, weaknesses in infrastructure, a high cost of electricity, and burdensome
customs clearance are often identified as major bottlenecks to doing business in the country. These
have resulted in losses in regional market shares in exports, tourism, and FDI since the early 2000s.
28.
The latest diverging trend between real wages and labor productivity in St. Vincent
and the Grenadines is worrisome. Historically, real wages in St. Vincent and the Grenadines have
moved closely with labor productivity and with

market, as well as shortage of qualified
personnel and skills mismatches. In this regard, increasing labor market flexibility, building human
capital, and containing the growth of public sector wages are essential.
29.
The authorities agreed with staff on the urgent need to expedite structural reforms to
boost competitiveness and lay a foundation for sustained medium-term growth. The
authorities agreed with staff’s assessment of the competitiveness challenges and they noted that
weak infrastructure is being addressed with donor assistance although alleviating the problem will
take time. They also highlighted the ongoing modernization at the Customs and Excise Department
and Port Authorities to improve clearance procedures and efforts to make the public sector more
efficient. They also pointed to various other initiatives that are underway to improve
competitiveness, including:


18

Reducing cost of business: In order to reduce the cost of electricity, the government last year
reduced the ‘demand charge,’ levied on businesses in addition to the regular tariff. They are also
exploring alternative energy sources (hydro, wind, and geothermal) in partnership with donors
and the private sector to reduce the cost of electricity over the medium to long term.

These are likely to be underestimated as explained in Annex II.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

17

ST. VINCENT AND THE GRENADINES



Efforts to boost tourism: The completion of the international airport project is expected to boost
the competitiveness of the tourism sector by improving access and reducing both cost and time
of travel. The establishment of the Tourism and Hospitality Institute, initiatives to strengthen
synergies between the tourism and exports and the agriculture sector with technical assistance
from donors (for example, the EU Funded-Banana Accompanying Measures), credit support to
farmers and the agriculture modernization program, are all expected to boost competitiveness.



Building skills and improving productivity: Improvements in the education system, including
better training of teachers, establishment of two new universities last year, various initiatives at
the community college to introduce vocational training and certification, are expected to
improve the quality of the labor force.

OTHER ISSUES
30.
Exchange Rate Regime: St. Vincent and the Grenadines is a member of the
Eastern Caribbean Currency Union, which has a common central bank and a common currency and
operates as a currency board. Since July 1976, the Eastern Caribbean dollar has been pegged to the
US dollar at the rate of EC$2.7 per US dollar. St. Vincent and the Grenadines has accepted the
obligation of Article VIII, Sections 2, 3, and 4 and maintains an exchange system free of restrictions
on the making of payments and transfers for current international transactions.
31.
Data provision and quality needs to be improved: Data provision has significant
shortcomings in some areas although it is broadly adequate for surveillance. Data relating to central
government accounts is generally adequate and available on a monthly basis. Monetary data and
banking sector soundness indicators are available but with long lags and there are significant gaps
in data for the nonbank financial sector. There are also significant lags in the availability of national
accounts data and there is no systematic reporting of labor market indicators which hampers an
assessment of real sector developments. Balance of payments data suffer from significant
weaknesses, especially capital account data, and data on the international investment position,
which is critical given the large external liabilities, is not available. That said, the authorities are
working closely with CARTAC to improve the timeliness and availability of statistical data, including
through capacity building at the Central Statistical Office.

18

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

ST. VINCENT AND THE GRENADINES

STAFF APPRAISAL
32.
A fragile recovery appears to be underway, but significant challenges remain. A modest
recovery in tourism and manufacturing appears to have contributed to the recent turnaround in
growth, although it remains subdued. The limited scope for domestic policy response given the high
debt levels and the currency board arrangement combined with weaknesses in financial sector
balance sheets continue to weigh down on growth. Growth is expected to pick up over the medium
term reflecting a recovery in tourism source countries and the completion of the airport project,
which is expected to improve access to the country. That said, structural reforms aimed at improving
competitiveness will be critical in determining whether growth can be sustained.
33.
Staff welcomes the authorities’ commitment to medium-term fiscal consolidation, but
urges them to adopt more ambitious expenditure measures. In particular, staff emphasized that
containing the growth of the wage bill is critical to create fiscal space for badly needed capital
expenditures and reduce public debt more rapidly, while helping narrow the real wage-productivity
differential. In addition, staff urged the authorities to implement market-based property taxes,
further strengthen the LTU, limit transfers to SOEs, and rationalize the various social assistance
programs. These measures will help to generate primary surpluses in the range 1½–2 percent of
GDP over the medium term. In addition to the reform efforts assumed in the baseline, a more
ambitious agenda for fiscal structural reforms, including civil service and pension reforms to
streamline wages and pension payments, could potentially generate significant savings and enhance
the government’s ability to address exogenous shocks.
34.
Staff urges the government to continue to remain prudent on debt. After a jump in
fiscal deficits in 2009 and 2010, reflecting decline in revenues and increased spending to help
mitigate the impact of the global slowdown and natural disasters, the fiscal balances have improved
over the last two years. While in part these reflect financing constraints, staff welcomes the
authorities’ commitment to avoid commercial borrowing to finance public spending despite
favorable terms in the RGSM. Looking ahead, streamlining current expenditures and rebalancing of
spending toward capital spending will be necessary to undertake priority capital projects. In this
context, staff urged the authorities to limit the planned commercial borrowing for the completion of
the international airport to safeguard the authorities’ medium-term objectives on fiscal and debt
sustainability.
35.
The authorities need to monitor financial sector vulnerabilities. While the domestic
banking sector appears to be resilient thus far, NPLs at credit unions and most importantly the B&L
association remain a significant concern. In this context, staff welcomed the establishment of the
FSA and urged the authorities to monitor these institutions closely. The authorities plan to seek TA
from CARTAC to improve the capacity of the supervisory staff.
36.
Staff welcomes the authorities continued efforts to diversify the economy. Staff
underscored the importance of structural reforms to improve the business climate and improve
competitiveness, as these are keys to private sector investment. Notably, the completion of the

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

19

ST. VINCENT AND THE GRENADINES

international airport project is expected to boost competiveness and growth by improving access
and reducing both cost and travel time. Over the medium term, the economy will benefit from
ongoing initiatives to enhance climate resilience, reduce energy cost, improve labor productivity,
and modernize customs and port services. It will also be essential to strengthen the synergies
among the tourism, exports, and the agriculture sector.
37.
Staff would like to encourage the authorities to improve data quality. It will be
important to work closely with CARTAC and implement its recommendations to help improve the
quality and timeliness of data quality. In addition, greater focus on building capacity in the central
statistical office as well as greater accountability of reporting agencies are also important to ensure
that data is reliable and timely.
38.
It is proposed that the next Article IV consultation be held on the standard 12-month
cycle.

High
The Euro area crisis is a major threat to the global
economic recovery. An intensification could drag
fragile growth of St. Vincent’s main tourist partners
like the US down, leading to not only lower tourist
expenditure but also to a decline in FDI.
Tourism constitutes 68 percent of exports and
30 percent of output (29 percent of tourists come
from US and 25 percent from Europe). A drop in
tourist arrivals by 10 percent would reduce GDP
growth in St. Vincent and the Grenadines by
3 percent and increases the current account deficit
by 2 percentage points of GDP.
A decline in FDI by 10 percent would decrease
construction activity by 1 percent and GDP by
0.1 percent.
Low/Medium
The banking sector in St. Vincent and the
Grenadines is dominated by foreign banks, with
only one bank part of a regional ECCU bank. The
impact from a deterioration in this sector is
expected to be small.

Diversify growth drivers, for instance,
by building a broader tourist base
(tourist campaigns in other markets
like Asia), rebalance fiscal spending
towards capital projects, and build
financial buffers.

Play a more proactive role in the
ECCU through the Monetary Council
and demand a quick implementation
of the recommendation of the
Financial Sector Task Force.

However, if the slow pace of resolution of these
banks creates financial uncertainty and a loss in
confidence, this could have more significant impact
on the economy, including derailing the economic
recovery.
Medium/High
Half of total loans of B&L association are nonperforming.
B&L association also has exposures to
BAICO/CLICO worth EC$12.2 million (4.9 percent of
total assets) though they increased provisions for
BAICO to EC$5.6.

Implement a framework to closely
monitor and gradually improve the
balance sheet of B&L association.
One of the first tasks of the newly
established Financial Services
Authority should be an onsite visit to
the B&L association to get clarity
over their books. This would help
both parties in establishing a
convincing strategy as to how to
improve the balance sheet of the
B&L association in the near future.

Natural disaster
(hurricanes, torrential

Likelihood:
High

Medium/High
Given the country’s dependence on agriculture and
tourism, both vulnerable to hurricanes and
flooding, the expected impact of such incidences
could range from medium to high depending on
the strength of the rains and the hurricanes.
For instance, hurricane Thomas led to a decrease in
GDP by 0.3 percent. The torrential rains and floods
in 2011 caused a decline in GDP by 1 percent.

5.

Oil supply shock and
nonfuel commodity
price shock
Likelihood:
Low

Medium
80 percent of St. Vincent and the Grenadines
energy supply depends on oil. An increase in oil
prices by 10 percent, all other things being equal,
would increase CPI by roughly 2 percent, worsen
the current account by 0.5 percentage points of
GDP, and reduce GDP by 0.2 percent.
The share of food in the CPI basket of St. Vincent
and the Grenadines is 22 percent. If food prices go
up by 10 percent, CPI increases by 4 percent,
current account deficit worsens by 0.9 percentage
points of GDP, and GDP declines by 0.6 percent.

34

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

Build climate resilience with the help
of the World Bank and other donors
to address disaster vulnerability. The
government should complement
these efforts by ensuring strict
enforcement of regulatory standards
for buildings and other
infrastructure. In addition, build
financial buffers to ensure room for
action in the event of natural
disasters.
St. Vincent and the Grenadines
should allow for a full pass through
of international prices with a
cautious use of targeted subsidies to
protect the poor and vulnerable if
necessary.

ANNEX II. EXTERNAL SECTOR ASSESSMENT
The persistent deterioration of the current account deficit since the early 2000s, partly
reflecting weaknesses in external competitiveness, raises concerns about its sustainability.

transfers and loan amortizations. This suggests
that improving export competitiveness and reducing the high reliance on imports are absolutely
critical to ensure current account sustainability over the medium term.
Assessments of the appropriateness of the real effective exchange rate also point to
overvaluation. Quantitative assessments based on CGER-type methodologies show that the real
exchange rate is overvalued, with the current account-based methodologies pointing to a higher
overvaluation. Specifically, the external sustainability approach, assuming that net foreign assets
(NFA) are stabilized at the historical 10-year average, shows an overvaluation of 20 percent and the
macro balance approach shows an overvaluation of some 15 percent as the underlying current
account deficit is much higher than the norm. The equilibrium real exchange rate (ERER) method
points to a lower overvaluation also reflecting the REER depreciation over the past decade.2 The rate
of REER overvaluation for the ECCU is estimated to be in the range of 3.8 percent (ERER approach)
to 11.6 percent (external sustainability approach).

1

St. Vincent and the Grenadines’ shares of exports, tourist arrivals, and FDI vis-à-vis the Caribbean have declined
considerably in recent years (Figure 1).
2

The ERER method is likely to have underestimated the overvaluation given the country’s large negative NFA
position. Estimates from the other 2 CGER methods might also have understated the degree of overvaluation. For
instance, the ES approach stabilizes NFA at -175 percent of GDP, but such a high level of NFA is not sustainable over
the long term.

Assessment of the underlying causes of the weaknesses in external competitiveness points to
structural factors. (Figure 1) Both data and perception-based assessments indicate that there are
several bottlenecks to doing businesses, including high cost of electricity (the second highest in the
region), limited air access from major tourist source countries due to small size of the airport, limited
capacity at ports, limited supply of skilled labor, and burdensome customs clearance. These
constraints highlight the pressing need for structural reforms to improve external competitiveness
and jumpstart private sector-led growth.

ANNEX III. FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE OF
STATE-OWNED ENTERPRISES
There are around 25 State-owned Enterprises (SOEs) in St. Vincent and the Grenadines with total debt of
around 10 percent of GDP (15 percent of total public sector debt) as of 2011. Despite explicitly
guaranteeing their external debt and implicitly assuming a contingent liability on their domestic debt, the
central government has a limited oversight of their operations apart from monitoring their debt holdings.
Among other factors, limited availability of timely financial data on the operations of SOEs has been the
main constraint. To help the authorities start monitoring the financial performance of SOEs and the
overall public sector in general, this mission built a framework for consolidating SOEs’ financial reports.
The resulting consolidated SOEs’ and public sector operations data, based on recent and latest financial
reports of major SOEs obtained through a concerted effort with the help of the Ministry of finance is
shown in Annex Tables 1 & 2.
Due to the nature of the public services they provide, some of the SOEs such as the Tourism Authority,
the Community College, the International Finance Services Authority, and the Roads, Building and
General Services Authority (BRAGSA) do not have their own revenue sources and are run entirely on
central government subventions. Consequently, their finances are implicitly reflected in the central
government’s finance. Of the remaining SOEs, St. Vincent Electricity Services Limited (VINLEC), National
Insurance Services (NIS), International Airport Development Corporation (IADC), Central Water and
Sewerage Authority (CWSA), the Port Authority, the National Lotteries Authority, the Agricultural Input
Warehouse Limited, and the National Properties Limited (NPL) are the largest by the sizes of their
operations and their debt holdings. With the exception of the IADC, which is partially self-financing, these
SOEs are fully self-financing though they enjoy implicit government assistance including through tax
exemptions and duty free imports. They constitute over 90 percent of SOE’s total revenues and owe
100 percent of SOEs’ total debt as of 2011. Consequently, a consolidated public finance report based on
the operations of the central government and these SOEs can fairly reflect the financial situation of the
overall public sector.
The resulting consolidated data for the self-financing SOEs, including the IADC, shows that their financial
performance is generally better than previously estimated. That said, there are variations among these
SOEs. For instance, the IADC and NPL have been running persistent deficits. VINLEC—the largest of all—
runs significant deficits at times when it undertakes big capital projects financed through external
borrowing. Given the authorities’ plans to pursue alternative energy sources, VINLEC is expected to run
deficits over the medium term. On the other hand, the global financial crises have turned NIS’s
historically persistent surplus into a deficit in 2011 through its impact on both contribution and
investment incomes. The deficit is expected to continue until the planned pension reforms are
implemented in the medium term, after which it is expected to revert to surplus.
The situation at the NPL, however, warrants the authorities’ attention. The primary function of the NPL is
to manage and sell real properties (mainly land) on behalf of the government. Its main revenue sources

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

37

ST. VINCENT AND THE GRENADINES

are rental income, management fees, and commissions. Even though NPL is a very small entity by the size
of its operations, it has a sizeable domestic debt (about 3 percent of GDP as of 2011 against its total
revenue of around 0.3 percent of GDP), most of which was transferred from IADC with a land swap. Given
limited progress on land sales due to a depressed real estate market, NPL’s ability to repay its debt is
currently in doubt. More importantly, the creditor for 95 percent of this loan is the NIS and NPL’s ability
to service its debt has a broader consequence on the overall public finance, highlighting the need for
closer monitoring.

Exchange rate arrangement: St. Vincent and the Grenadines is a member of the Eastern
Caribbean Currency Union, which has a common central bank (the Eastern Caribbean Central
Bank) and currency (the Eastern Caribbean dollar). Since July 1976, the Eastern Caribbean dollar
has been pegged to the U.S. dollar at the rate of EC$2.70 per U.S. dollar. St. Vincent and the
Grenadines has accepted the obligations of Article VIII, Sections 2, 3, and 4. St. Vincent and the
Grenadines maintains an exchange system free of restrictions on the making of payments and
transfer for current international transactions.

VIII.

Safeguards Assessment: Under the Fund's safeguards assessment policy, the Eastern
Caribbean Central Bank (ECCB), of which St. Vincent and the Grenadines is a member, is subject
to a full safeguards assessment under a four year cycle. The most recent assessment was
completed in April 2012, and did not identify any significant safeguards risks. ECCB
management places emphasis on good governance and sound controls, and has enhanced the
bank's transparency and accountability since the last assessment, including the publications of
financial statements that comply with International Financial Reporting Standards. The
assessment made some recommendations to sustain the ECCB's safeguards framework going
forward.

Technical assistance (January 2006– ): Several missions from the Caribbean Regional
Technical Assistance Centre (CARTAC), the Fiscal Affairs Department (FAD), the Support of
Economic Management for the Caribbean (SEMCAR), and the Legal Department (LEG) have
visited St. Vincent and the Grenadines since the beginning of 2006 to assist the authorities. In
the area of public finance, CARTAC/LEG assisted with the introduction of the VAT and excise
taxes at all different stages. CARTAC also assisted to monitor the central government’s fiscal
performance relative to its annual targets presented in the budget. A workshop for Permanent
Secretaries on strategic budgeting reforms together with general public finance training has
also been delivered. CARTAC has provided technical assistance in statistics to develop exportimport prices, national accounts, and balance of payments statistics. CARTAC has also
provided technical assistance in the areas of collection, enforcement, and projections of public
finance and GDP. On the financial front CARTAC provided technical assistance to review and
upgrade the International Insurance Act, and to develop regulations for Credit Unions. CARTAC
also provided technical assistance in conducting off-site and on-site examinations on banks in
international financial services industry. FAD provided technical assistance in improving tax
administration, including reform and modernization of both inland revenue and customs and
excise tax. FAD also provided advice on selected tax policy issues and expenditure
rationalization. In CY 2011/2012, CARTAC delivered technical assistance to review the revenue
performance of the Value Added Tax and recommended measures to enhance and safeguard
VAT revenues. CARTAC also supported a capacity building program in audit and assisted with
the development of Inland Revenue Department’s revised function-based organizational
structure that resulted in a full integration of VAT administration into mainstream IRD. In
Customs, CARTAC focused on modernization of the operations by strengthening risk
management and post clearance (PCA) programs. In 2011/2012 SEMCAR assisted the
authorities in introducing a performance orientation in the budget of three ministries, reviewed
the treasury and modernized the budget execution process. In addition SEMCAR helped setting
up a cash management unit and introduced cash flow forecasting.

RELATIONS WITH THE WORLD BANK GROUP
(January 10, 2013)
In June 2010, the Board of Executive Directors of the World Bank discussed a joint Bank/IFC Regional
Partnership Strategy (RPS or Strategy) for the six independent territories of the Organization of
Eastern Caribbean States1 (OECS). The Strategy covers a five year period which coincides with the
duration of the election cycles in all six countries, although the timing of the elections in the
countries is not aligned. The inter-related strategic objectives of the RPS are: (a) building resilience;
and (b) enhancing competitiveness and stimulating growth over the medium term. A Progress
Report that assesses the implementation of the Strategy at the mid-term and outlines how the Bank
will position itself strategically for the remainder of the RPS period has been presented to the Board
in May 2012.
The OECS countries were among the countries in the world hardest hit by the global financial and
economic crisis and have experienced a significant lag in recovery relative to other countries in the
Latin American region. Economic growth in the OECS has been severely undermined, with ripple
effects across the economies, particularly through a decline in tourism activity and the FDI related
construction sectors upon which these countries depend. Furthermore, the agriculture sector
contracted due to pest infestation, drought and Hurricane Tomas in October 2010. The global
slowdown also exacerbated existing weaknesses in the financial sector, increasing the risk of
spillovers across countries. In addition, limited fiscal space, the result of high debt and debt service,
severely constrained the governments’ ability to implement countercyclical policies to cushion the
impact of the crisis. As a consequence, vulnerability across the region has increased and remains a
major element of concern going forward. On the positive side, however, the OECS continued to
pursue ambitious goals for further political and economic integration with the implementation of
the OECS Economic Union.
The OECS are also among the countries most adversely affected by the impacts of climate variability.
Climate shocks represent a dominant factor driving output fluctuations in the region, which severely
affecting development prospects. In the OECS, natural disasters account on average for almost
20 percent of the variance of real GDP growth and the evidence shows that an adverse natural event
in one country has a statistically significant spillover effect on neighboring countries in the region.
To help build resilience, the Bank Group is supporting interventions aimed at promoting fiscal and
debt sustainability, protecting and improving human capital—particularly social safety nets,
education and health—and strengthening climate resilience. To help enhance competitiveness and
stimulate sustainable growth, it focuses its support on two critical areas: strengthening the countries’
domestic financial sectors and improving access to quality services to create more competitive
1

While the OECS comprises six independent countries and three British Overseas Territories, the RPS covers only the
six independent countries, namely: Antigua and Barbuda; Dominica; Grenada; St. Kitts and Nevis; Saint Lucia; and
St. Vincent and the Grenadines. Excepting St. Vincent and the Grenadines which did not join IFC, all are members of
the World Bank Group.

business environments. The Strategy provides urgent remedial measures to address the crippling
effects of the global and regional crises, while supporting key policy reforms that establish a
platform for growth in the medium term.
The planned program of support indicate in the RPS will entail new commitments totaling up to
about US$120 million on IBRD terms for the six Bank Members of the OECS and up to US$73 million
of IDA financing (depending on their Country Policy and Institutional Assessment-CPIA) for the four
OECS (Dominica, Grenada, St. Lucia, St. Vincent and the Grenadines) which are also eligible to IDA
(blend).
Like its OECS partners, the key policy priorities for St. Vincent and the Grenadines are to jump-start
growth while keeping debt and deficits at reasonable level and maintaining economic gains by
reducing vulnerability to exogenous shocks. In the area of tourism, progress can be made to revive
the tourism product more broadly, including further investments in infrastructure. In the area of
fiscal consolidation, the policy priority has been to increase revenues, contain expenditures and
introduce a public sector modernization agenda.

World Bank Group engagement
Comprehensive Debt Framework - At the request of the Heads of Government of CARICOM, the
Bank put together a Comprehensive Debt Framework that proposes a strategy for addressing the
high debt challenge faced in the OECS in a sustainable way. This Framework proposes a holistic
approach around four interdependent pillars (Supporting private sector led growth, including
private sector development and financial sector stability; Enhancing fiscal sustainability; Improving
climate change resilience and Disaster Risk Management; and Debt resolution). The Framework is
being rolled out in the OECS, including St. Vincent and the Grenadines, where the World Bank
conducted a scoping mission in July 2012. The Government expressed interest in principle, in
working jointly with the World Bank and other development partners to develop policy measures
that could help stimulate growth and reduce debt in the country.
The Caribbean Growth Forum (CGF) – The Caribbean Growth Forum (CGF) is an initiative led by
the Inter-American Development Bank, the Caribbean Development Bank and the World Bank, in
collaboration with the United Kingdom Agency for International Development (DFID) and the
Canadian International Development Agency (CIDA), to identify policies and initiatives aimed at
inducing growth and creating jobs in the Caribbean region through analytical work, knowledge
exchange and inclusive dialogue. The CGF will provide an action oriented forum for governments
and other key non-traditional stakeholders (youth, private sector, Diaspora) to engage in a dialogue
around the growth and development challenges with a view to identify—through a participatory
bottom-up approach—practical and implementable solutions that inspire action. The CGF will then
support and facilitate the implementation by the Government of key reforms to stimulate private
sector led growth according to a detailed schedule and in a transparent and accountable fashion. In
FY2013, the CGF dialogue will focus on 3 themes, namely "Logistics and Connectivity", "Investment
Climate", and "Skills and Productivity". St. Vincent and the Grenadines has expressed interest in

holding a national CGF event on January 17, 2013 to engage both traditional and non-traditional
stakeholders in an action-oriented national dialogue around growth and development challenges.
CGF national events have already taken place in Dominican Republic (November 1, 2012), Antigua
and Barbuda (November 19, 2012) and Grenada (December 11, 2012), and have been scheduled in
St. Lucia (January 22, 2013) and Dominica (January 24, 2013) as well.

Projects
The OECS E-Government for Regional Integration Program was approved by the Board in
May 2008. The loan to St. Vincent and the Grenadines was approved in December 2009 and consists
of a US$2.3 million IDA Credit designed to promote the efficiency, quality, and transparency of
public services through the delivery of regionally integrated e-government applications that take
advantage of economies of scale. The idea behind EGRIP is that countries can purchase
eGovernment applications together and obtain volume discounts. The program focuses on
generating regional consensus and designing cross-sectoral e-government applications for all four
countries, including (i) a front-end eTax Filing System that allows businesses and citizens to file their
taxes online, (ii) an OECS-wide eTendering System for Pharmaceuticals that facilitates OECS
countries’ purchase of pharmaceuticals in bulk, and (iii) Multipurpose Identification System to be
installed in all countries, and generating unique personal identification numbers.
The Caribbean Regional Communication Infrastructure Project (CARCIP) - Phase 1, was
approved by the WB Board in May 2012 with Grenada (US$10 million IDA), St. Lucia (US$6million
IDA) and St. Vincent and the Grenadines (US$6 million IDA) as participating countries. The
Dominican Republic is preparing its inclusion to CARCIP ($30m IDA), while other Caribbean islands
have formally expressed interest in joining. CARCIP is a broad umbrella program to include all
interested CARIFORUM countries. It offers a menu of choices with specific components to be
tailored to each country's priorities. The menu of options are: (a) ICT Connectivity, to increase access
and affordability of broadband communications networks within region and countries;
(b) e-Government, to contribute to improved Government efficiency and transparency through the
delivery of e-services, including e-government and e-society applications; and (c) IT Industry, to
contribute to the development of the regional and national IT industry. The sources of financing are
a mix of World Bank, CDB, IDB lending, donor grant funding, the government's own resources and
substantial amounts of private sector investment. The instrument chose for this program (APL)
allows countries to join on a readiness basis. Phase 1 of CARCIP was declared effective in
December 2012.
The Hurricane Tomas Emergency Recovery Credit was approved in January 2011 for US$5 million
and aims at rehabilitating damaged infrastructure caused by the passage of Hurricane Tomas and
strengthening the Government’s ability to analyze location-specific risks. The project has three
components: i) Component 1 will rehabilitate and reconstruct vulnerable and damaged
infrastructure; ii) Component 2 will improve the capacity of the Ministry of Housing, Informal Human
Settlements, Lands and Surveys and Physical Planning (MoHILP) and the National Emergency
Management Organization (NEMO) to evaluate natural hazard and climate change risks by training

their staff and providing technical advisory services and acquisition of goods; and iii) Component 3
will strengthen and develop the institutional capacity of the Public Sector Investment Program
Management Unit (PSIPMU) for project management and execution, including procurement,
financial management and supervision of project activities, through the acquisition of goods,
provision of technical advisory services, training, and operating costs.
The OECS Disaster Vulnerability Reduction Project was approved in June 2011. St. Vincent and
the Grenadines will receive a total of US$20.92 million, including a US$10.92 million zero-interest
credit from IDA repayable in 35 years with a 10-year grace period; a US$7 million grant from the
Pilot Program for Climate Resilience (PPCR); and a US$3 million zero-interest loan from the PPCR
repayable in 40 years with a 10-year grace period. The project aims to create understanding of the
vulnerability of key structures and increase resilience of critical public infrastructure, which will
complement the work and goals of the PPCR. Component 1 will implement a broad spectrum of
interventions aimed at building resilience in public buildings and infrastructure. Component 2 will
support regional efforts in the Eastern Caribbean to build capacity to conduct assessment of natural
risks and integrate such knowledge into policy- and decision-making for development investments,
disaster risk mitigation, climate change adaptation, and disaster response planning across sectors.
Component 3 will re-categorize financing or provide additional financing to cover early recovery and
rehabilitation costs following an adverse natural event, and subject to a Government’s declaration of
emergency in accordance with national law and the submission of a recovery action plan satisfactory
to the Association. Component 4 will strengthen and develop the institutional capacity for project
management and implementation.

Economic and Sector Work
The Bank has completed a series of analytical products relating to public expenditure, fiscal and
debt sustainability, growth and competitiveness, the financial sector, public sector management and
social protection. The ongoing dissemination of these reports represents a key instrument for policy
dialogue with the OECS governments, including St. Vincent and the Grenadines.
In the context of the Support of Economic Management for the Caribbean (SEMCAR) program, a
team is working with the authorities on an Action Plan for Customs improvements and has assessed
the system by using the Customs Assessment Trade Toolkit (CATT). The CATT assessment measures
120 high level indicators which are combined and aggregated into seven intuitive dimensions:
Process orientation, Strategic thinking, Transparency, Control, Efficiency, Effectiveness and
Facilitation. The distinctive feature of the CATT is that it is evidence base framed by a set of
international best practices which are compared against the practice that currently is used.
The Bank’s program in St. Vincent and the Grenadines is further supported by a comprehensive
series of completed, ongoing and planned analytical and advisory activities, including the following:
“Towards a New Agenda for Growth” – OECS growth and competitiveness study (2005); An OECS
Skills Enhancement Policy Note (2006); a Caribbean Air Transport Report (2006); a regional study on
Crime, Violence, and Development: Trends, Costs, and Policy Options in the Caribbean (2007); an
OECS Private Sector Financing Study (2008); the OECS Tourism Backward Linkages Study (2008); the
report titled “Caribbean – Accelerating Trade Integration: Policy Options for Sustained Growth, Job

RELATIONS WITH THE CARIBBEAN DEVELOPMENT
BANK (CDB)
(As of December 13, 2012)

A small open economy, St. Vincent and the Grenadines is particularly vulnerable to economic shocks
and natural hazards. Since 2008, a series of such adverse exogenous shocks have caused major
economic losses, weakening the country’s macroeconomic position. Even as the direct impact of the
global slowdown has lessened, weather-induced shocks associated with Hurricane Tomas, a severe
drought and torrential rainfall and flooding in 2010 and 2011 have added to macroeconomic
weaknesses.
In the aftermath of these recent disasters, CDB’s assistance to the Government of Saint Vincent and
the Grenadines has focused on providing grant and loan funding to assist with emergency relief and
economic rehabilitation and recovery efforts. The Bank will be providing a loan of US$12.62 million
(approved in July 2011) to rehabilitate and reconstruct critical infrastructure, and upgrade and
improve affected emergency shelters to internationally accepted standards. The project also
provides for technical assistance to the Government of St. Vincent and the Grenadines to undertake
a hydraulic assessment study of major watersheds in the central and north windward region of the
island, for developing standard operating procedures for disaster responses for the Ministry of
Transport and Works, and for undertaking a coastal study as well as medium to long-term sea
defense designs for capital works at Sandy Bay and Dark View. A substantial part of this financing is
being provided on concessionary terms through the Bank’s Special Development Fund.
In December 2011, the Bank approved a concessionary loan of US$5.0 million for the development
of technical and vocational education and training. The purpose of the project is to increase the
supply of skilled and employable labor with regionally acceptable certification by approximately
4000 by 2016. An important component of project is teacher training with 230 persons targeted for
training by 2016. A total of 23 classrooms/workshops/laboratories will be built or upgraded. The
targeted beneficiaries are secondary school students, unemployed and at-risk youth and adult
learners. The project will also establish the institutional and informational infrastructure for the
ensuring that training is market demand driven.
In December 2012, the Bank approved a loan of US$13.6 million of which US$7.1 million was
concessionary financing for the purpose of rehabilitating and upgrading the South Leeward
Highway. The project will involve the building and upgrading of 11.4 kilometers of roadway, the
upgrading of two bridges and of drainage infrastructure. The target completion date of the project
is March 2016.
At December 2012, cumulative loans approved by CDB to the Government and Statutory Authorities
stood at US$278.1million, of which US$221.9 million was disbursed, while total loans outstanding
INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

11

ST. VINCENT AND THE GRENADINES

amounted to US$139.0 million. Of the total loans approved, US$62 million was borrowed during
2009 and 2010 under the framework for policy-based lending to help mitigate the effects of the
global crisis on public finances, and to support a range of macroeconomic and financial sector
reforms. Those loans have been fully disbursed.
Since 2010, the disbursement of CDB financing has fallen off significantly as flows normalized
following the accelerated rate of disbursement in prior years. At the same time, however, CDB
project operations have been adversely affected by the Government’s constrained fiscal position
which impinged on the Government’s ability to adequately provide counterpart financing. Given the
lower disbursements, there was a negative net transfer of resources (that is, disbursements of loans
less repayments of principal, interest and charges) between CDB and St Vincent and the Grenadines.

STATISTICAL ISSUES
I.

Assessment of Data Adequacy for Surveillance

General: Data provision has some shortcomings, but is broadly adequate for surveillance. Statistical
databases remain weak in terms of coverage, consistency, periodicity, and timeliness. While in areas
central to surveillance—notably central government accounts, indicators of the financial sector and
external sector accounts—the data are adequate for surveillance purposes, information on the rest
of the public sector and nonbank financial intermediaries is limited. Major improvements are needed
to facilitate effective surveillance, particularly in the coverage of national accounts (especially
expenditure based national accounts), and on data used to monitor labor markets.
National Accounts: A new rebased GDP series (using 2006 as the base year instead of 1990) was
released in January 2011 with assistance from CARTAC. The new series improved coverage, data
sources, and methodology. The revision disaggregated some industries previously classified under
government into separate sectors that now include private sector activity; these are health,
education, and social development. The new series also improved the level of detail by estimating
value added for business services, computer and related services, and private households with
employed persons which were not accounted for in the previous series. A CARTAC Mission is
assisting the authorities to revise the estimates of GDP by expenditure at constant and current
prices. In October 2007 CARTAC also launched a project for strengthening tourism statistics in the
OECS, including St. Vincent and the Grenadines. The project covers the core tourism datasets
relating to visitor arrivals, visitor expenditure, tourist accommodation and statistics for other key
tourism-related enterprises. The project will also seek to standardize and harmonize tourism
concepts, definitions and classification schemes across these countries.
Price statistics: A new CPI index series (with January 2010 as the base) was introduced in June 2011
with assistance from CARTAC. The new index introduced updated methods and procedures used for
compiling the CPI that are in accordance with international standards and allows comparisons
among the ECCU member states. The new index uses a Household Budget and Expenditure Survey
(HBES) that took place in 2008, replacing the old HBES conducted in 1996, to construct an updated
CPI basket. As part of the CARTAC’s assistance with the new CPI index it helped link the 2001 based
to the 2010-based CPI series.
Government finance statistics: Due to delays in reporting capital expenditures by some ministries,
monthly revenue and expenditure data for the central government are provided to the Fund with
some lag. Discrepancies exist between the fiscal and monetary accounts, between above and below
the line for budget data, and between financing and debt data. The financial reports of public
enterprises are not timely, with about a two-year lag.
Monetary statistics: Monetary statistics are compiled and reported to the Fund by the ECCB on a
monthly basis based on a standardized report form since July 2006. The institutional coverage of
monetary statistics needs to be improved by including the accounts of mortgage companies,

building societies, credit unions, and insurance companies. In this respect, close coordination
between the ECCB and the new established FSA (which is supervising financial institutions other than
those licensed under the Banking Act) will be crucial.
While noting some recent improvements, the 2007 data ROSC mission identified the following main
shortcomings in the ECCB’s monetary statistics: (i) the methodological soundness of monetary
statistics can be improved by adopting internationally accepted concepts and definitions, expanding
institutional coverage, and revising the classifications of financial instruments and the basis for
recording; (ii) transparency can be improved, for example, by releasing monetary data to all users at
the same time and strengthening the validation of the disseminated data; (iii) the timeliness of the
dissemination of data on broad money and credit aggregates can be improved to meet best
international practices; and (iv) the access to officially disseminated data and metadata can be
improved.
Balance of payments: Balance of payments data are compiled by the ECCB on an annual basis.
Data reported to STA are becoming more timely, although quality, frequency and coverage need to
be improved. Quarterly estimates and the international investment position statement are not
compiled. The estimates lack sufficient detail due to the unavailability of source data, and the
statistical techniques used to estimates some components are weak. In particular, no estimates are
available on transportation services by type or mode of transport and of travel by purpose. Further,
a breakdown of portfolio and other investment by instrument or sector is not available. There is a
need to compile quarterly balance of payments estimates and the annual international investment
position statement; however, developing these new statistics will have to be undertaken in
conjunction with the ECCB, which coordinates the compilation of the external sector statistics for all
its member countries.
External debt: The Ministry of Finance maintains a database on public and publicly-guaranteed
external loans that provides detailed and current information on disbursements, debt service, and
debt stocks. The Treasury maintains the data on bonds placed abroad. Data from the two databases
as well as information on payments by creditor (actual and scheduled) need to be further
consolidated to produce timely debt stock data.
II.

Data Standards and Quality

St. Vincent and the Grenadines participates in the General Data Dissemination System since
September 2000. The 2007 regional data ROSC on monetary statistics provides an assessment of the
ECCB’s monetary statistics. No data ROSC is available for other sectors.

STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2012 ARTICLE IV
January 16, 2013

CONSULTATION—DEBT SUSTAINABILITY ANALYSIS
Approved By
Gian Maria MilesiFerretti and
Elliot Harris

Prepared by the Staff of the International Monetary
Fund.

The current Debt Sustainability Analysis (DSA) indicates that, under the baseline scenario
discussed in the Staff Report, St. Vincent and the Grenadines’ risk of external debt distress
remains moderate. While the public sector debt will increase further in the coming two
years owing to anticipated borrowing for the airport project, the public debt to GDP ratio
is projected to revert to a sustainable trajectory over the medium term in light of the
authorities’ commitment to undertake fiscal consolidation measures and the projected
rebound in economic growth.

ST. VINCENT AND THE GRENADINES

INTRODUCTION
1.
Slow recovery appears to be underway after three consecutive years of output contraction.
Economic activity contracted by about 1.7 percent per annum, on average, during 2008–10, reflecting the
impacts of the global slowdown, the international commodity price increases in 2008–09, and draught and
Hurricane Tomas in 2010. Another weather shock, torrential rains and floods, in April 2011 derailed the
ongoing recovery; as a result, growth remained tepid at around ½ percent last year. Government efforts to
counter the impacts of these shocks resulted in a reversal of the 1.1 percent of GDP primary surplus in 2008
to a persistent deficit since then. At the same time, the public sector debt-to-GDP ratio increased by
10½ percentage points to 67.8 percent in 2011. External debt constituted around 63 percent of the public
sector debt at end-2011, of which about two-thirds is multilateral debt. The Caribbean Development Bank
is the creditor for the bulk of the multilateral debt. The central government owed about 85 percent of the
total public sector debt at end-2011, with the rest owed by state-owned enterprises.1

2.
The fiscal stance is expected to be tighter this year, reflecting financing shortfalls. Revenue
outturns and external disbursements for the first 10 months of the year fell short of expectations. As usual,
the brunt of financing shortages falls on capital expenditure, where only a quarter of the planned projects

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

ST. VINCENT AND THE GRENADINES

are expected to be executed. The overall deficit is expected to be 2¾ percent of GDP, lower by about a
percentage point of GDP compared to last year.

UNDERLYING ASSUMPTIONS IN THE BASELINE
SCENARIO
3.
The DSA analysis is based on the following macroeconomic framework, assuming that the
authorities will implement the policies discussed in baseline scenario of the staff report.


Growth and Inflation: Growth is expected to be around ½ percent in 2012 and to increase to
1 percent in 2013. Over the medium term, growth is projected to reach its potential level of
3 percent, reflecting improved employment and consumption conditions in tourism and FDI
source countries and the expected completion of the international airport project. End-period
inflation is expected to have eased to around ¾ percent in 2012, reflecting declining
international food and fuel prices. Over the medium term, inflation is projected to revert to its
long-term path of around 2½ percent, anchored by the currency board arrangement.



Fiscal Balance: While a small surplus of around ½ percent of GDP is expected for this year, the
public sector primary balance is projected to deteriorate significantly next year to a deficit of
3½ percent of GDP due to expected increasing activity at the international airport project
financed mainly by borrowing. Over the medium term, however, the primary balance is
projected to register surpluses in the range of 2 percent of GDP, mainly reflecting the central
government’s commitment to generate primary surpluses in the range of 1 percent of GDP, and
the expected completion of the airport project2. Revenue is projected to increase over the
medium term, reflecting the authorities’ plan to implement a number of revenue enhancing
measures such as implementation of market-based property tax, improvements in compliance
and enhancement of tax audits, and streamlining exemptions. External grants, which peaked in
2009, are projected to decline to around 2 percent of GDP over the medium term and further fall
to 1½ percent of GDP in the long term. On the other hand, expenditures in percent of GDP are
expected to remain high as there is limited appetite for expenditure cutting measures.



External Sector: The current account deficit is expected to remain high at around 28 percent of
GDP in 2012, but it is projected to narrow continuously to around 18 percent of GDP by 2017.
Tourism and FDI are assumed to rebound as economic recovery strengthens in source countries
(mainly North America and Europe), over the medium term. The grant element of new external
borrowing is projected to fall over the medium to long term, reflecting difficulty of accessing
concessional resources as per capita income increases, however, the grant element will continue

2

The SOE’s projected primary deficit in the coming two years is primarily due to the international airport project,
which is managed by a state-owned enterprise (the International Airport Development Corporation). After the
completion of the project in 2014, the SOEs combined are expected to generate primary surpluses in the range of
1 percent of GDP.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

ST. VINCENT AND THE GRENADINES

to remain high in the near to medium term in line with the central government’s commitment
not to borrow on non-concessional terms.

EVALUATION OF PUBLIC SECTOR DEBT SUSTAINABILITY
4.
The public sector debt will continue to increase in the near term, but is projected to revert to
a downward trajectory over the medium term as long as the authorities generate primary surpluses
in the range of 1 percent of GDP. The public sector debt-to-GDP ratio is projected to peak at
74.7 percent by 2014, mainly reflecting borrowing for the International Airport project. However, the debt
trajectory is expected to start a downward trend afterwards, reflecting fiscal consolidation measures that
the authorities plan to take combined with the projected rebound in economic growth, as discussed in the
staff report. The public debt-to-GDP ratio is projected to fall to 59 percent of GDP by 2020, just below the
ECCB’s recommended threshold of 60 percent.
5.
Sensitivity analysis shows that permanently lower GDP growth is a key vulnerability for
St. Vincent and the Grenadine’s debt dynamics. Under a scenario where growth is permanently lower by
one standard deviation divided by the square root of the length of the projection period, the Present Value
(PV) of debt-to-GDP ratio would reach 71 percent by 2022 and over 97 percent by 2032, compared to the
base line levels of 51 percent and 32 percent in 2022 and 2032, respectively (Table 1b, Scenario A2).

EVALUATION OF EXTERNAL DEBT SUSTAINABILITY
6.
St. Vincent and the Grenadines’ risk of external debt distress remains moderate. Under the
baseline scenario, the PV of public sector external debt is estimated at 39 percent of GDP in 2012 and is
projected to decline to 24 percent of GDP by 2022, half of the threshold value of 50 percent3 (Table 2b).
The present values of debt and debt service to export and revenue ratios also remain below the respective
thresholds under the baseline scenario. Nevertheless, these ratios would permanently exceed the respective
prudential thresholds under the ‘Historical’ scenario, where key macroeconomic variables such as real GDP
growth, GDP deflator, growth of exports, and non-debt creating flows are assumed to be at their respective
averages for the last 10 years.4 This highlights the pressing need for implementing fiscal consolidation and
structural reform measures, as discussed in the staff report, to improve competitiveness and jumpstart
economic activity.

3

The DSA uses policy-dependent external debt burden indicators. Policy performance is measured by the Country
Policy and Institutional Assessment Index (CPIA), compiled annually by the World Bank, categorizing countries into
three groups based on the quality of their macroeconomic policies (strong, medium, and poor). St. Vincent and the
Grenadines is classified as a strong performer, with the thresholds on PV of debt-to-GDP, debt-to-exports, and debtto-revenue of 50, 200 and 300 percent, respectively.

4

The historical scenario for this year’s DSA differs significantly from that of last year’s DSA because the 10-year
historical averages for this year drops one ‘good’ year (2000) and includes one ‘bad’ year (2011) for key
macroeconomic variables.

4

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

ST. VINCENT AND THE GRENADINES

7.
Sensitivity analysis shows that St. Vincent and the Grenadines’ external debt dynamics is
vulnerable to changes in non-debt creating flows and the nominal exchange rate. The stress test
assuming that net non-debt creating flows are at historical average minus one standard deviation in
2013-2014 shows that the PV of external debt-to-GDP ratio would jump to 52 percent in 2013, breaching
the country-specific threshold of 50 percent, and will remain above 50 until 2019. Similarly, the PV of
external debt-to-GDP ratio would jump to 56 percent in 2013 and remain above 50 percent until 2016
under the scenario of a one-time 30 percent nominal depreciation relative to the baseline in 2013
(Table 2b, Scenario B6).

ACTIVE SCENARIO: HIGHER CAPITAL SPENDING AND
NO COMMERCIAL BORROWING FOR THE AIRPORT
8.
Re-orientation of central government spending into infrastructure and avoiding commercial
borrowing for the airport would reduce the public sector debt to a more desirable level. Additional
investment in infrastructure, financed through savings from current expenditure, would increase mediumterm growth by about ½ a percentage point. This would help reduce the public sector debt in percent of
GDP. Further reduction in public sector debt would be achieved if the government continues to rely on
external grants, land sales and some concessional resources for the airport project, avoiding the planned
commercial borrowing assumed in the baseline. Under this scenario, the public sector debt would fall to
52½ percent of GDP by 2020. While the external debt distress still remains in the moderate range, the PV
of public sector external debt would be at 38 percent of GDP in 2013 and is projected to decline to
25 percent of GDP by 2022, well below the threshold value of 50 percent (Figure 3).

CONCLUSION
9.
St. Vincent and the Grenadines’ public debt is projected to revert to a sustainable trajectory
over the medium term and the external debt distress remains moderate. While the fiscal situation has
been deteriorating in recent years, the authorities are committed to fiscal consolidation measures, in
particular on the revenue side. These, along with projected improvements in economic prospects, are
expected to improve the fiscal situation and ensure debt sustainability over the medium term. Reorientation of spending into capital projects would improve the medium-term growth prospects and bring
down public sector debt to a more desirable level.

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2012 Article IV Consultation with St. Vincent and the
Grenadines
On February 6, 2013, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF)
concluded the Article IV consultation1 with St. Vincent and the Grenadines.
The economy of St. Vincent and the Grenadines shows signs of recovery, but at a slower
pace than expected in 2011. After three consecutive years of negative growth, reflecting the
impact of the global financial crisis, higher commodity prices and natural disasters, real GDP
grew by about ½ percent in 2011. Economic activity indicators for the first six months of
2012 suggest a modest pick-up in tourism arrivals, manufacturing, and agricultural activity.
Real GDP growth is expected to be around ½ percent this year, as weak construction activity
partly offsets the modest upticks in manufacturing and tourism. Pressures on prices have
eased, consistent with declining commodity prices, with year-on-year inflation reaching a
low of 0.9 percent in September 2012, after peaking at 4.7 percent at the end of 2011. The
external current account deficit remains high at around 30 percent of GDP, largely reflecting
higher than expected imports relating to foreign direct investments (FDI), fuel, and
international airport construction. Private sector credit growth remains sluggish and
continues to drag on growth. While this reflects a tightening of lending standards by banks in
the wake of the financial crisis and high non-performing loans (NPLs), it also shows banks’
hesitation to lend to private businesses despite excess liquidity.
The fiscal deficit is expected to narrow by about one percentage point compared to last year
to about 2¾ percent of GDP, as lower-than-projected revenues were offset by cuts in capital
expenditure due to financing constraints. That said, spending on wages and salaries is
expected to be somewhat higher given the recent announcement of a retroactive wage

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with members,
usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial information, and discusses
with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a
report, which forms the basis for discussion by the Executive Board.

increase of 1½ percent for civil service workers for 2011 and 2012. Earlier in the year, the
government issued a EC$40 million 10-year bond on the Regional Government Securities
Market (RGSM) to help finance the deficit.
Weak growth performance has taken a toll on the financial sector. NPLs at banks remain in
the 7–7½ percent range, almost twice their pre-crisis level, with considerable variation across
banks. Similarly, bank profitability has declined significantly since 2009. While capital
adequacy ratios at around 20 percent are relatively high, inadequate provisioning against
NPLs (less than 30 percent) calls for caution in interpreting these ratios.
Non-bank financial institutions endure low profitability and their balance sheets continue to
come under stress with average NPLs at credit unions broadly similar to those at banks.
Available data on NPLs at the Building and Loan (B&L) Association indicate that half of its
loan portfolio was overdue in 2011. Although exposures to BAICO and CLICO were partly
written off in 2011 by two credit unions and the B&L association, a considerable amount
remains on their books and a further write-off could worsen their balance sheets.
Regional efforts to resolve the fallout from the BAICO/CLICO failure are underway. In
addition to the establishment of the Medical Support Fund last year to address the needs of
medical policyholders, negotiations for selling BAICO’s life insurance portfolio to a regional
insurance company are well advanced. It is also expected that with the help of the money
committed by Trinidad and Tobago, annuity holders may start receiving partial payments by
the end of 2012.
Growth is expected to improve over the medium term, albeit gradually, on the back of
projected improvements in economic activity in advanced economies and the expected
completion of the international airport, which is expected to boost tourism.

Executive Board Assessment

Executive Directors noted that the St. Vincent and the Grenadines’ economy is showing signs
of recovery following a series of negative shocks. Nevertheless, the near-term outlook for
growth is challenging due to the high level of public debt and weaknesses in the financial
sector. Directors considered that continued commitment to prudent macroeconomic and
financial policies as well as structural reforms to improve competitiveness are key to
sustaining growth and enhancing the economy’s resilience to shocks.

2

At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the Board, summarizes the views
of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the country's authorities. An explanation of any
qualifiers used in summings up can be found here: http://www.imf.org/external/np/sec/misc/qualifiers.htm.

3

Directors welcomed the authorities’ commitment to fiscal consolidation and to the realization
of primary surpluses in the medium term. They emphasized that ensuring fiscal and debt
sustainability, making room for growth-enhancing capital expenditures, and building buffers
against potential future shocks will require further efforts to increase revenues and reduce
current expenditure. To this end, Directors encouraged steps to contain the wage bill, limit
transfers to state-owned enterprises, and reform of public pensions system. They also called
for elimination of discretionary exemptions, strengthening administrative capacity, and
improving tax compliance. While recognizing the need for commercial borrowing for the
international airport project, Directors urged the authorities to continue to pursue a prudent
debt policy to safeguard fiscal and debt sustainability.
Directors underscored the need to monitor the bank and the non-bank financial sectors and to
address the vulnerabilities by strengthening supervisory and regulatory standards. In this
context, they welcomed the recently established Financial Services Authority and encouraged
expeditious resolution of issues at any domestic financial institutions, drawing on technical
assistance from international financial institutions.
