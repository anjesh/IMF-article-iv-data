IMF Executive Board Concludes 2016 Article IV Consultation Discussions with the
Kingdom of the Netherlands-Curaçao and Sint Maarten
On July 27, 2016, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded the
2016 Article IV Consultation discussions with Curaçao and Sint Maarten, two autonomous
countries within the Kingdom of the Netherlands, and considered and endorsed the staff
appraisal without a meeting.1,2
The currency union of Curaçao and Sint Maarten has important strengths, including a high level
of development, good infrastructure, and relatively low public debt, however, preserving these
going forward will require surmounting some critical challenges. GDP per capita is already at
high-income country levels, but growth is lackluster and unemployment levels are high. The
fiscal situation remains relatively stable, following the debt relief in 2010, but progress on
necessary fiscal and structural reforms has been slow.
For several years now, both countries have experienced stagnant growth, trailing behind regional
peers. Curaçao experienced modest growth in 2015 of 0.1 percent, reflecting a turnaround from
the contraction of 1.1 percent in 2014. Growth in Curaçao mainly reflected an increase in
investment (both public and private), driven largely by the construction of the new hospital and
the upgrade of road infrastructure. Meanwhile, the economy of Sint Maarten expanded by 0.5
percent in 2015, a slowdown compared to the 1.5 percent recorded in 2014. The expansion in
Sint Maarten’s GDP mainly reflected an increase in stay-over tourist arrivals, though at a slower
pace than in 2014. With the exception of the recent expansion project at the Princess Juliana
International Airport, there were no major private investment in 2015, underscoring the need to
boost investor confidence.

Under Article IV of the IMF’s Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with members, usually every year. A staff team visits
the country, collects economic and financial information, and discusses with officials the country’s economic developments and policies. On
return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the Executive Board.

Article IV consultations are concluded without a Board meeting when the following conditions apply: (i) there are no acute or significant risks,
or general policy issues requiring Board discussion; (ii) policies or circumstances are unlikely to have significant regional or global impact; (iii)
in the event a parallel program review is being completed, it is also being completed on a lapse-of-time basis; and (iv) the use of Fund resources
is not under discussion or anticipated.

2

Real GDP growth in 2016 is expected to reach 0.5 percent in Curaçao and 0.7 percent in Sint
Maarten. For Curaçao, economic activity is projected to accelerate reflecting continued
economic recovery in main trading partners (especially the U.S.) and a continuation of both
private and public investment projects, mostly supported by the hospital construction. Higher
growth in Sint Maarten reflects expectations for higher private spending, particularly in the
tourism and transportation sectors, and a moderate increase of tourism flows.
Over the medium term, growth is expected to moderately pick up to 0.9 percent and 1.3 percent
for Curaçao and Sint Maarten, respectively. The expansion in both countries will mainly depend
on the implementation of structural reforms aimed at attracting more FDI, relaxing restrictions
on hiring foreign labor, and reducing costs of doing business.
Executive Board Assessment
In concluding the 2016 Article IV consultation discussions with Curaçao and Sint Maarten,
Executive Directors endorsed the staff’s appraisal, as follows:
The economic recovery and a stronger fiscal position have helped reduce near-term risks.
Curaçao ended a three-year recession in 2015, despite the deterioration in macroeconomic
conditions in Venezuela—one of the island’s main trading partners. Expansion in Sint Maarten’s
economy continued into the fourth consecutive year, despite a modest deceleration. The Union’s
external and fiscal imbalances have also declined, with favorable external conditions and the
authorities’ fiscal consolidation efforts, but vulnerabilities to external shocks remain given its
reliance on a narrow scope of products and markets.
However, risks to medium-term growth prospects remain to the downside. Continued low growth
in the euro area could have serious economic repercussions for Curaçao and Sint Maarten
through various channels, given that both islands remain heavily reliant on the euro area. Further
disruptions in Venezuela could worsen Curaçao’s growth prospects and balance of payments if
no alternative export markets are identified. Meanwhile, a loss of CBRs could hinder crossborder transactions, adding to the macroeconomic uncertainties. In addition, slow progress in
implementing needed structural forms also poses an important downside risk to growth prospects
going forward.
Unlocking growth through economic diversification and investment promotion is therefore
imperative in this environment. In this respect, the authorities’ national development plans are
an important step toward charting a clearer direction for strategic sectors and markets and
removing impediments to private sector activity. Implementation of the plans is key, in
particular, on decisive structural reforms to improve the labor market and doing business
conditions, as well as energy sector reforms to diversify energy generation via renewable
sources.

3

A sound medium term fiscal framework will help reinforce macro stability anchored by the fixed
exchange rate. With the limited effective monetary and exchange rate policy instruments, given
the fixed exchange rate regime, fiscal policy is the authorities’ only available option to cushion
economic shocks. A sound medium term fiscal framework, equipped with clear objectives and
targets and supported by a proven track record could improve credibility, bolster investor
confidence, and promote investment.
In this regard, important structural fiscal reforms are needed to further strengthen fiscal
discipline. In particular, weaknesses in tax administration and public financial management have
been identified in both islands. Staff welcome the authorities’ efforts to strengthen tax
administration to enhance revenue mobilization, improve taxpayer services, and increase tax
compliance. These are important prerequisites for future tax policy reforms contemplated by the
authorities. In addition, an action plan is greatly needed to ensure timely and decisive
implementation of measures to strengthening public financial management, in line with PEFA
assessment recommendations.
Strengthened financial supervision has become more important given increasing international
scrutiny. The authorities are advised to strengthen risk-based financial supervision and effective
implementation of cross-border tax information sharing, as well as AML/CFT frameworks in
line with international standards. In a context of evolving regulatory requirements and
enforcement landscape, Curaçao and Sint Maarten’s ability to strengthen transparency, including
in Curaçao’s international financial center, will help reduce the perceived reputational risks. A
stable financial sector is also critical to supporting economic growth and private sector activities.
Capacity building is needed to strengthen public institutions. Policy implementation has been
greatly challenged by capacity issues in both islands, as in most other Caribbean small states.
Investment in human capital development is critical to strengthening public institutions and
improving productivity. Staff urge the authorities to engage with their international partners in
seeking technical assistance to support capacity building.
Data provision should be improved to allow adequate surveillance. The statistical offices in both
countries expressed concerns over lack of capacity, ability to hire qualified personnel, and delays
in data submission from the private sector and government entities. While some efforts have
been made to streamline data collection and digitalize surveys, staff highlights the need to
allocate additional resources to increase personnel and obtain technical assistance to address
shortcomings.

STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2016 ARTICLE IV CONSULTATION
DISCUSSIONS

KEY ISSUES
Context. The currency union of Curaçao and Sint Maarten has important strengths,
including a high level of development, good infrastructure, and relatively low public
debt. However, preserving these going forward will require surmounting some critical
challenges. GDP per capita is already at high-income country levels, but the islands must
combat lackluster growth and high unemployment levels by addressing weak
competitiveness and improving the investment environment. The fiscal situation remains
relatively stable, following the debt relief in 2010, but sustained efforts on fiscal and
structural reforms are required to lock in gains and ensure continued fiscal and debt
sustainability. The authorities’ structural reform plans are welcomed, but continuity in
policy will be essential going forward, particularly in the context of the upcoming
elections in both countries, scheduled for September 2016.
Unlocking growth. The authorities have identified strategic areas for structural reforms,
but sustained efforts and decisive implementation are needed, particularly in removing
the impediments to private sector-led growth. Increasing labor productivity and
improving competitiveness are key for unlocking growth potential.
Strengthening the fiscal framework and building buffers. Important progress has
been made to improve the fiscal positions in both islands through compliance with the
fiscal rules. The current fiscal policy framework could be further strengthened with a
clear medium term debt target to safeguard fiscal and debt sustainability, while
providing a policy cushion and flexibility to accommodate external shocks.
Maintaining financial stability. While the financial sector appears to be generally
stable, private credit remains weak and there are signs of deteriorating asset quality in
the banking sector, following years of subdued economic growth. In addition, the recent
loss of correspondent banking relationships by small banks in Curaçao underscores the
need for greater efforts to strengthen financial supervision, cross-border sharing of tax
information, and the AML/CFT framework, with a particular focus on Curaçao’s
international financial center.

KINGDOM OF THE NETHERLANDS—CURAÇAO AND SINT MAARTEN

BACKGROUND
1.
Macroeconomic conditions in Curaçao and Sint Maarten are similar to those in the
Eastern Caribbean Currency Union (ECCU) countries, with some important differences. Curaçao
and Sint Maarten formed a currency union following the dissolution of the Netherlands Antilles in
2010, and kept the guilder, which has been pegged to the U.S. Dollar at 1.79 since 1971. Both islands
suffer from stagnant growth, with growth rates trailing regional peers for nearly a decade.
Nevertheless, per-capita GDP remains among the highest in the Caribbean (US$26,457 for Sint
Maarten and US$20,587 for Curaçao in 2015). While the Union’s current account deficit has steadily
declined over the last few years, external sustainability continues to be challenged by persistent
large current account deficits (predominantly from Curaçao). As in most ECCU countries, credit
growth has been negative since 2013, despite ample liquidity in the banking system, which was in
part fueled by large portfolio investment inflows from the Kingdom of the Netherlands. Both
countries have made significant progress on fiscal consolidation and are now fully compliant with
the legislated fiscal rules. After considerable assistance in the form of debt relief from the
Netherlands in 2009-10, public debt ratios in Curaçao and Sint Maarten are now low by regional
standards.1

2.
Efforts have been made to implement the policy recommendations from the 2014
Article IV Consultation discussions, however, progress has been slow (Box 1). Considerable
progress in reducing risks associated with pension funds and state-owned enterprises (SOEs) has
been made, and additional reforms are forthcoming. While neither island has formally adopted a
VAT as recommended by the technical assistance provided by the IMF’s Fiscal Affairs Department in
2009, the fiscal position has benefited from progress in keeping public wage developments in check.
The central bank has also made steady progress in implementing monetary and financial policy
recommendations to ensure financial stability. Less progress has been made however, in
implementing recommendations to improve labor market conditions.

3.
Staff urges the authorities to implement measures to improve the quality of statistics,
to better support effective macro-economic surveillance. There is significant room for
improvement in the coverage and timeliness of data, in particular on national accounts, public
finance in GFS format, and international investment positions (IIP). In both countries, staff noted
large data gaps with GDP estimates, with lags as far back as 2006 for various expenditure
components.2 Besides, with no reliable deflator, or deflators by sector, the real GDP series are
derived based on the consumer price index. In addition, some components of Sint Maarten’s
balance of payments (BOP) statistics have been compiled as the difference between the Union and
Curaçao’s, inevitably resulting in large unexplained swings in the island’s BOP developments in
certain years.

RECENT ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS
4.
Economic performance remains weak in both countries. For several years now, both
countries have experienced lackluster growth, trailing behind regional peers. Curaçao experienced
modest growth in 2015 of 0.1 percent, reflecting a turnaround from the contraction of 1.1 percent in
2014. Growth in Curaçao mainly reflected an increase in investment (both public and private), driven
largely by the construction of the new hospital and the upgrade of road infrastructure. Meanwhile,
the economy of Sint Maarten expanded by 0.5 percent in 2015, a slowdown compared to the 1.5
percent recorded in 2014. The expansion in Sint Maarten’s GDP mainly reflected an increase in stayover tourist arrivals, though at a slower pace than in 2014. With the exception of the recent
expansion project at the Princess Juliana International Airport, there was no major private
investment in 2015, underscoring the need to boost investor confidence. Unemployment in both
countries remains relatively high at 11.7 percent and 8.9 percent for Curaçao and Sint Maarten,
respectively. However, youth unemployment is estimated to be significantly higher, in the region of
30 percent for Curaçao and 25 percent for Sint Maarten.

Inflation remains subdued, reflecting low pressure from international commodity
prices. Following a period of moderate inflation during 2010–14, averaging 2.2 percent in Curaçao
and 2.8 percent in Sint Maarten, inflation in Curaçao stood at -0.5 percent in 2015 and 0.3 percent in
Sint Maarten, largely reflecting lower international oil prices. However, core inflation in Curaçao,
which excludes food and energy, decelerated only modestly from 1.3 percent in 2014 to 1.1 percent
in 2015.3

percent in 2014, primarily reflecting lower oil
prices and higher tourism arrivals. In contrast, Curaçao’s current account deficit widened to 15.3
percent of GDP in 2015 from 11.9 percent in 2014, largely due to lower refining and transportation
exports, and lower bunkering activities with the decline in oil prices. These were only partly offset by
lower oil imports associated with the decline in oil prices.
7.
Curaçao and Sint Maarten were both fully compliant with their fiscal rules in 2015.
Both countries complied with the rules-based fiscal framework, which comprises an “interest burden
rule” (a cap on the interest payments to revenue ratio), and a “golden rule” of borrowing only for
investment. Nonetheless, the public debt of the Union increased from 30.5 percent of GDP in 2013
to 41.5 percent of GDP in 2015—partly but not entirely reflecting pre-financing—and fiscal
performance for the two countries diverged noticeably.

operational deficits of the SEHOS hospital and the national health insurance fund.
The tax-to-GDP ratio moderately recovered to 25.7 percent in 2015, ending a fouryear downward trend, due to improved tax compliance and increases in property tax
rates. With interest payments at around 1 percent of GDP (or around 3½ percent of
total government revenue), the overall fiscal deficit was 2.8 percent of GDP in 2015.
The government issued three long term loans during 2014-15, totaling NAf 526
million (or 9.3 percent of 2015 GDP) to pre-finance the new hospital, resulting in a
rapid buildup in public debt to 44.3 percent of GDP at end 2015 (compared with 34.6
percent in 2010).

a decrease in capital spending and lower wage bill (which declined to 10.1 percent of
GDP from 10.6 percent in 2014). Tax revenues increased to 20.3 percent of GDP from
19.7 percent in 2014, largely reflecting higher taxes on income and profits. The debt

Credit growth remained weak despite ample liquidity in the banking system. Despite
robust deposit growth, which has led to further accumulation of bank reserves to well above the
regulatory requirement, private sector credit remains weak.4 This in part reflects a deterioration of
asset quality (¶9), which has dampened banks risk appetites. Meanwhile, as credit demand remained
subdued with long term investment decisions deterred by macroeconomic uncertainties, bank
lending to private sector remained flat in 2015.

4

Since 2014 (when the bank level credit ceilings were lifted) the central bank has relied solely on the auctioning of
Certificates of Deposits to mop up excess liquidity, by offering more attractive rates and various maturities.

Despite a recent deterioration in asset quality and profitability, the banking sector
appears to be generally stable, supported by adequate capital buffers. The nonperforming
loans (NPL) to total loans ratio remains elevated at 11.3 percent in 2015, as bank asset quality
deteriorated during the recent economic downturn.5 This, along with a lower net interest margin
and increased competition among banks, has negatively affected bank profitability. Banks’ capital
buffers, however, appears to be adequate with a capital adequacy ratio of 13.6 percent in 2015,
above the 10 percent regulatory requirement. Some local banks have recently reported a loss of
correspondent banking relationships (CBRs), which calls for a proactive policy response by the
authorities (¶34).

The commercial banks undertook some adjustments in 2014 to lower their NPL ratios and increase their loan-loss

increase their ability to withstand possible macroeconomic shocks.

spending, particularly in the tourism and
transportation sectors, and a moderate increase of tourism flows. Meanwhile, inflation is expected to
accelerate gradually to 0.8 percent in Curaçao and 1 percent in Sint Maarten, as the effect of lower
oil prices is countered by an increase in prices in the U.S. and the Netherlands, the Union’s main
trading partners.
11.
Medium-term prospects remain broadly positive but will depend on the authorities’
efforts to address structural bottlenecks. Over the medium term, growth is expected to
moderately pick up to 0.9 percent and 1.3 percent for Curaçao and Sint Maarten, respectively. The
expansion in both countries will mainly depend on the timely implementation of structural reforms
aimed at attracting more FDI, relaxing restrictions on hiring foreign labor, and reducing costs of
doing business (¶18-21).

On the external side, the Union’s current account deficit is projected to gradually
improve over the medium term. The deficit is expected to narrow in 2016, reflecting projections
for lower oil prices and higher tourism receipts, notwithstanding higher imports of construction
material related to public investment projects (particularly the construction of a new hospital in
Curaçao). Given adequate external financing, including from foreign direct investments, debt issues,
and a decrease in foreign assets, the Union’s net international reserves are projected to increase in
2016. Going forward, the Union’s external imbalances are expected to gradually decline as tourism
demand picks up. Nevertheless, given the reliance on a narrow scope of products and markets,
considerable risks remain, underscoring the need to improve competitiveness, reduce vulnerabilities

to external shocks, and build external buffers to ensure external sustainability going forward. Staff
estimates, which are based on limited data and subject to considerable uncertainty, suggest that
Curaçao’s REER is somewhat undervalued, while that of Sint Maarten is somewhat overvalued
(Annex II).
13.
On current policies, Curaçao’s fiscal position is expected to gradually improve, but
public debt will continue to build up. The primary deficit is projected to narrow to 1.4 percent of

GDP at end 2016, relative to 36.5 percent at end 2015.
15.
Risks to the macroeconomic outlook are tilted to the downside (Annex I). Continued
low growth in the euro area could negatively affect Curaçao and Sint Maarten through trade,
tourism, remittances, and investment channels. Persistent strengthening in the U.S. dollar could lead
to further appreciation of the REER, and a loss in competitiveness vis-à-vis European and Canadian

tourists. Reduced financial services by global/regional banks could result in disruptions to banking
services, hindering cross-border financial transactions. Given the close trade relationship, Curaçao
remains vulnerable to a further disruption of economic activity in Venezuela (Annex IV). Other
downside risks include slow implementation of planned structural reforms, an outbreak of Zika, and
a natural disaster in Sint Maarten. Upside risks include improving economic prospects in the U.S.
generating tourism for Sint Maarten, higher investment flows through major tourism projects, and
spillover and productivity gains through higher public investment if managed prudently.
16.
With the current low levels and favorable public and external debt dynamics for
Curaçao and Sint Maarten, the Debt Sustainability Analysis (DSA) finds the risk of debt
distress low, but the debt paths are sensitive to shocks (Annex III). In Curaçao, while public debt
is already on an upward trend, a combined macro-fiscal shock7 could add another 10 percentage
points to its debt-to-GDP ratio. Besides, under a full-blown Venezuela shock scenario (where all
trade links between the two countries are removed and the refinery business comes to a complete
stop in 2019), Curaçao’s debt-to-GDP ratio could end up 7½ percentage points above the baseline
by 2021. In Sint Maarten, the debt-to-GDP ratio is projected to increase by 10 percentage points
under a hurricane scenario (assuming a 10 percent of GDP increase in government expenditure in
2017 to cover post-disaster reconstruction needs). Both island’s significant vulnerability to shocks
calls for the authorities’ sustained efforts on reforms to strengthen their fiscal frameworks, build
policy buffers, improve external competitiveness, and unlock growth potential.

POLICY DISCUSSIONS
A. Growth and Competitiveness
Background
17.
Both economies continue to operate
below capacity, exhibiting low convergence
towards potential growth. Labor productivity
growth remains low, negatively impacting
output growth and competitiveness (text chart),
particularly in Curaçao, where labor productivity
growth has averaged -0.2 percent over 2012-15.
Meanwhile, broader competitiveness indicators
are mixed, pointing to high labor costs, subdued
inflation and a moderate increase in the number
of stay-over tourist arrivals (but a decline in
market share) in both countries (Annex II).

Policy Discussions
18.
The mission welcomes the authorities’ ambitious plans to strengthen competiveness
and reinvigorate their economies through important structural reforms. In Curaçao, the
National Development Plan 2015-30 aims at encouraging foreign direct investment, stimulating
priority sectors with potential for higher value added (including the free zone, maritime and aviation
sectors), ensuring inclusive quality education, and promoting good governance. In Sint Maarten,
where tourism represents the highest share of the economy, a tourism authority has been recently
established and a development plan is currently being discussed, to diversify the tourism sector,
reduce its seasonality, and increase value-added.
19.
Given the Union’s small population base, a flexible labor market equipped with
appropriate skills is needed to improve competitiveness and growth potential. In Curaçao,
labor market reforms should focus on addressing restrictive dismissal laws and protective work
permit policies (for foreign labor) that hinder labor market flexibility (Box 2). Although the labor
market in Sint Maarten is less restrictive, efforts are needed to improve efficiency and timeliness in
granting required permits for foreign workers. To address mismatches in skills, the authorities in
both islands have recognized the need to refocus the education system. The mission recommends
renewed efforts to improve vocational education and develop targeted training programs to
strengthen skills and improve productivity. The Sint Maarten authorities have recently embarked on
a government-sponsored employment program to address high youth unemployment. Close
monitoring and assessment of program deliverables will be critical to ensure the effective
deployment of public resources.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

KINGDOM OF THE NETHERLANDS—CURAÇAO AND SINT MAARTEN

Box 2. Labor Market Issues
Low growth and high unemployment underscore the need to address declining labor
market productivity and improve labor market flexibility in the Union. Unemployment
remains high, especially among the youth in both Curaçao and Sint Maarten. At the same time,
the work force cannot adequately meet the demand for labor. The focus of labor market policy,
including on flexibility, has shifted frequently and contributes to uncertainty.
Education systems and technical and vocational training are currently not fully aligned to
meet the countries’ needs. This exacerbates issues related to small populations and migration,
which also contribute to a mismatch between the supply and the demand for labor. There are also
limited quality technical and vocational training institutions and no certifying institutions. The
authorities also recognize the need for greater focus on building soft skills and on career
mentoring to help better prepare young people for the work place.
Generous welfare benefits act as a disincentive to employment in the formal sector
contributing to a high reservation wage, particularly in Curaçao. Unemployment benefits in
Curaçao often exceed the minimum wage, covering, among other things, housing, healthcare
costs, and provide subsidies for water and electricity. This could incentivize persons to work in the
informal sector while collecting benefits. Although Curaçao has implemented reforms to reduce
fraud and now requires that persons receiving welfare undergo training and actively seek
employment, controls are often weak. Sint Maarten’s welfare benefits are less generous at
approximately 67 percent of the minimum wage.
Restrictions on hiring foreign workers limit the ability to fill employment gaps. Both
countries require that persons seeking employment are sponsored by an employer, and that the
employer initiates the application for the work permit. In addition, the employer must show that
the vacancy was advertised in the local market without success. In Curaçao, the Permit department
is faced with a number of challenges, including an insufficient budget, understaffing, and
inadequate office space, which has led to a backlog in permits, beyond the six weeks’ maximum
required by law. While Sint Maarten processes work permits in 2 weeks, the process is lengthened
by the need to first obtain a landing permit, which can take 3-4 weeks.
Dismissal laws are also inflexible in both countries. This has encouraged the use of short-term
contracts rather than the creation of stable employment. As such, even where the skills required
are available locally, these posts may not be filled, given the limited job security they provide.

Staff emphasized that improving the business climate is critical to reigniting investor
confidence, promoting private sector activity, and attracting foreign direct investment. The
mission therefore welcomes the authorities’ efforts in both islands to rationalize business licensing
requirements, reduce transportation costs, and promote fair competition. The mission also endorses
the authorities’ plan to proactively address red tape through centralization and streamlining of
business registration processes, and to improve efficiency in government services and reduce
transaction costs. In addition, maintaining a stable political environment and ensuring policy
continuity is critical to promoting long term business investment decisions.
21.
Staff urged the authorities to quickly advance implementation of energy sector
reforms geared toward cost reduction and long term sustainability to improve
competitiveness and build resilience. As in many other Caribbean islands, energy costs are high in
Curaçao and Sint Maarten, where high reliance on imported-fossil-fuel-based generation increases
their vulnerability to external shocks.8 The authorities in both islands have recognized, through their
national development plans, the importance of diversifying the generation mix through the
development of renewable energy. Follow through with steadfast implementation is critical to
reducing energy costs and achieving a stable, sustainable and clean energy future. Moreover, the
energy sector regulatory framework needs to be strengthened in Sint Maarten by introducing an
independent regulator.9
22.
Authorities’ views. The authorities concurred with staff about the importance of removing
impediments to private sector activity by enhancing the doing business and labor market
conditions. They stressed that vocational education and skills training are among the key priorities
for addressing skills mismatches, unlocking growth, and improving competitiveness over the
medium term. Regarding energy sector reforms, the authorities noted that several initiatives for
renewable energy have been considered, including wind and solar power, seawater cooling, and
“waste-to-energy”, under their national development plans.

B. Strengthening Fiscal Framework and Building Buffers
Background
23.
The Union has a rules-based fiscal policy framework monitored by the Board for
Financial Supervision (Cft in Dutch). Each island submits its budget to the Cft, who verifies the
realism of the assumptions and the adherence to the rules-based framework, and if necessary
recommends changes to the budget. The Cft’s function is reviewed every three years, to ascertain
whether there remains a need for continued oversight and the accompanying low-cost “standing
subscription” borrowing arrangement, which allows both countries to borrow at prevailing rates in
8

In both Curaçao and Sint Maarten, electricity generation is provided by a single government-owned company with
a monopoly also on distribution. Although state-owned, no subsidy currently exists and the electricity tariffs
comprise two components: i) the base component to cover all non-direct production costs, and ii) the fuel
component that is determined by international oil prices and adjusted monthly.

Energy pricing has been regulated by an independent regulator in Curaçao since 2010.

the Dutch capital market. The most recent review was undertaken in 2015, which extended the Cft’s
function till 2018.
Policy Discussions
24.
Staff proposed that the current rules-based framework be strengthened to ensure
fiscal and debt sustainability. While the framework provides a strong basis for containing shortterm fiscal risks, it does not provide a sufficient medium term anchor for debt sustainability. A
strengthened fiscal framework is particularly important in the context of the upcoming 2018 review
of the Board for Financial Supervision (Cft in Dutch) oversight function and the current low-cost
“standing subscription” borrowing arrangement.10 If the agreement was to be discontinued
following the review without an agreement for the refinancing of debt incurred under the current
access to low rate financing, net flows from the Dutch borrowing arrangement could turn negative,
resulting in higher interest costs going forward. The increase in borrowing costs, would over time
erode the gains from debt relief and put public debt on an upward trend. Moreover, rising interest
costs will make it increasingly difficult to satisfy the “interest burden rule” and accelerate debt
accumulation. Hence, staff proposes that the rules be supported by adopting a medium-term
macro-fiscal framework that includes a primary balance target consistent with a long-run debt
anchor of 40 percent of GDP, which is around the median level of developing and emerging
countries. The 40 percent of GDP target is also the benchmark debt ratio used in the standard Fiscal
Monitor long-term adjustment needs scenario for emerging market economies, and is consistent
with the debt norm proposed by the Cft for Curaçao and Sint Maarten.
25.
In addition, the fiscal framework should allow adequate flexibility and be
complemented by improved effectiveness of public spending and capacity building to
strengthen public institutions and fiscal discipline. Staff’s proposed strengthened framework
would ensure the flexibility needed to accommodate the investment in skills development, crucial to
unlocking growth, and allows adequate flexibility to accommodate temporary deviations over
economic cycles and in the case of natural disasters and other emergencies. The fiscal framework
should also include a corrective mechanism with clearly spelt out fiscal measures to correct for any
temporary deviations from the target.

10

There has been no formal commitment that the Cft oversight and the “standing subscription” arrangement will or
will not be extended after the 2018 review. However, staff suggested to the authorities that a stronger fiscal
framework would increase their ability to avoid and/or withstand a potential large interest rate risk.

(i) Curaçao
26.
To mitigate medium-term risks, staff discussed with the authorities a fiscal framework
that envisages a 1.5 percent of GDP adjustment phased evenly over 2017-19. This framework is
anchored by a 40 percent of GDP long term debt target, and is operated via targets on the primary
balance. The adjustments in the primary balance needed for the public debt to gradually decline and
stabilize at 40 percent could be achieved by: (i) improving tax compliance (0.5 percent of GDP), (ii)
reducing personnel expenditure through attrition and implementation of merit-based salary
increments (0.4 percent of GDP), and (iii) containing national health insurance expenses through cost
restructuring (0.6 percent of GDP). In this respect,

term fiscal sustainability (¶29 and Annex V).
(ii) Sint Maarten
27.
Staff recommended that policy focus on building fiscal buffers for natural disasters,
and strengthening institutional capacity to support prudent fiscal management and preserve
fiscal and debt sustainability. As public debt in Sint Maarten is projected to remain below 40
percent of GDP under staff’s baseline scenario, staff does not envision a need for immediate upfront
fiscal consolidation. However, unlike Curaçao, Sint Maarten lies within the Hurricane belt,
underscoring the need to build fiscal buffers for natural disasters. The authorities agree with staff’s
recommendation to set aside budget

regard, the authorities agree that this goal can be achieved through measures to improve tax
administration, and mobilize revenues. In addition, future consideration could be given to replacing
the sales turnover tax with an efficient and sufficiently broad based value added tax (VAT). While the
authorities do not see much room to adjust expenditures, staff encouraged the authorities to
explore measures to contain the wage bill, which remains above 10 percent of GDP, to make room
for other critical spending, including on human capital development.
28.
Staff welcomes the authorities’ capacity building efforts, particularly to improve tax
administration and public financial management (PFM), and achieve compliance with the
fiscal rules. The mission welcomes steps taken by the authorities in Curaçao to improve tax
administration, by reducing backlogs in tax assessments and the treatment of objections,
rationalizing tax receivables, as well as efforts to improve compliance (including the introduction of
fiscal cash registers). Staff encourages Sint Maarten to implement similar measures and, importantly,
to take steps to develop human capacity in tax administration. Further efforts are needed in both
islands to improve budget formulation and cash flow management, and other key areas highlighted
in the 2015 Public Expenditure and Financial Accountability (PEFA) assessments, supported by the
Cft. Addressing these weaknesses will require a clear action plan supported by systematic technical
assistance to assist the authorities to implement the plan. It is also critical that both governments
implement measures to support the production of timely fiscal and macroeconomic statistics,
essential to public policy formulation.
29.
Staff welcomed the progress made in reducing risks associated with state-ownedenterprises (SOEs) and social security systems. The financial position of SOEs has improved
significantly, however, further steps should be taken to address deficit making institutions, in
particular Curaçao’s post office, and to ensure transparency and good governance (Box 3). Recent
reforms to the social security and pension systems have helped mitigate short term risks, but policy
focus should shift toward addressing medium to long term system shortfalls, and ensuring their
sustainability. Strong efforts are also required to reduce risks related to increasing healthcare costs.

Box 3. Fiscal Risks and State-owned Enterprises
State-owned enterprises (SOEs) are a key source of fiscal risk for Curaçao and Sint Maarten.
Risks related to unexpected changes in macroeconomic variables are relatively low, following the
debt relief program, which assures low cost financing in local currency. However, SOEs present a
potentially significant source of fiscal risk, underscoring the need to ensure transparency and
accountability within these institutions, and for measures to address inefficiencies.
At the time of the 2014 Article IV Consultation discussions, staff identified several issues
related to transparency and oversight of SOEs. For Curaçao, above-market wages and other
inefficiencies translated into a high cost of doing business. While in Sint Maarten, in the absence
of a clear dividend policy, profitable SOEs minimized their contribution to the public budget.
Since then, Curaçao has made significant progress in strengthening the financial position of
SOEs. The financial situation in all but one of four high-risk state-owned enterprises has improved
significantly over the last two years, based on reforms instituted by the authorities.


Aqualectra, the utility company, took steps to better align employee compensation with
market norms, and to ensure that prices reflect the full pass-through of oil prices. Importantly,
Aqualectra has been able to recover losses from previous years by adding a “recovery price”
to the regular price. The authorities are also negotiating the return of assets, previously
distributed to the refinery at no cost.



Analytic Diagnostic Center, the medical laboratory, in addition to realigning employee
compensation, took steps to reduce overstaffing, improve the invoicing process, contain
operational costs, and improve debt collection.



Curaçao Dry Dock Company (CDM) settled claims from previous employees, related to poor
working conditions and underpayment, and prospects for the company have improved with
the signing of a LOI with an international strategic partner. The partnership is expected to
bring in new investments and increase the Dry Dock’s capacity to meet the demand for its
main line of business, ship repair services.



CPost, the post office, remains a high-risk entity as the action plan, developed to improve its
financial position, has not been fully implemented. The cost of providing services remains
higher than revenues, with losses amounting to NA f. 3-4 million guilders (US$1.7 million –
US$2.2 million) annually. This in part reflects discounts to the government and the Social
Security Bank, making the plans politically challenging to implement.

In Sint Maarten, SOEs have historically not been a drain on government resources. The
authorities have recently drafted a dividend policy to provide a framework for remitting dividends
to the government. While the draft policy identifies the relevant financial ratios that can be used
to determine whether a dividend can be paid to the government, the decisions to pay a dividend
and the amount are left to the shareholders. The authorities believe that the SOEs are better able
to decide when they can pay a dividend, based on their position and future plans, and prefer not
to set explicit terms.

30.
Authorities’ views. The authorities agreed in principle on the appropriateness of staff’s
proposed medium–term fiscal framework, but were of the view that, while 40 percent is a reasonable
target, the decision on the level of the debt target should be left to the individual governing
authorities. In the area of tax administration, the Sint Maarten authorities highlight human capital as
the most significant challenge, and note that the need to balance the current budget constrains
spending on skills development and capacity building, therefore limiting progress in this area. The
authorities are taking steps to integrate the tax administration function, which is currently separated
into two departments, the Tax Assessment Department and the Audit and Control Department. They
are also exploring the possibility of utilizing the financial tax software system shared by the Dutch
municipalities (Bonaire, St Eustatius, and Saba) and Curaçao. This would not only be an improvement
over the current system, which is outdated, but would allow for shared costs. They recognize the
potential benefits from adopting a VAT but indicate their first priority is improving tax
administration.

C. Maintaining Financial Stability
Policy Discussions
31.
The financial sector is generally stable with no imminent systemic risk, supported by
strengthened supervision at both sector and institution levels. The central bank’s Early Warning
Monitoring System has been enhanced to allow better assessment of financial sector soundness and
to enable the central bank to perform regular stress tests to assess financial sector resilience. A riskbased rating model is also embedded in the system to detect financial sector weak spots,
complementing targeted supervision. Stability indices, on financial sector soundness, tracked by the
central bank for the domestic banking, insurance and pension sectors (which account for
approximately 95 percent of total financial sector assets) have remained stable over the past five
years. 11 However, given macroeconomic uncertainties going forward and recent deterioration in
bank asset quality and profitability, staff encouraged the authorities to continue their efforts to
strengthen financial oversight (especially in the non-bank sector), through on-site and off-site
supervision.
32.
Sustained efforts are needed to strengthen the AML/CFT framework in line with the
FATF standard and mitigate perceived ML/TF risks. In this regard, the authorities have recently
updated their AML/CFT legislation and issued new compliance guidelines and criteria to the financial
institutions based on FATF recommendations. An action plan to address strategic deficiencies
identified following Sint Maarten’s assessment of its AML/CFT framework by the CFATF is currently
under review. The authorities are encouraged to fully address remaining regulatory gaps and ensure
effective risk-based implementation of the AML/CFT regime.

11

Stability indices comprise five indicators including asset quality, capital adequacy, liquidity, profitability, and
sensitivity to market risk.

KINGDOM OF THE NETHERLANDS—CURAÇAO AND SINT MAARTEN

33.
Some small local banks in Curaçao have recently experienced a loss of CBRs. While
existing CBRs with large European banks could provide a temporary buffer in the short run, staff
encouraged the authorities to continue monitoring the status of CBRs and address reputational risk
by strengthening their compliance with AML/CFT and transparency of tax information standards.
34.
Staff continued to emphasize that the central bank should refrain from direct lending
to SOEs, which could cause market distortions. The central bank embarked on an asset purchase
program to build a portfolio of corporate bonds with an ultimate goal to create a substitute for the
conduct of open-market operations, as the short term government security market dried up since
2010.12 There has been no new purchase since 2012 and currently there are two loans (both to SOEs)
in the portfolio. Staff has urged the authorities to restrain from further central bank direct lending
and to continue their efforts to further develop a corporate bond market, to provide financing
alternative to bank financing for SOEs and private entities, and to create more local investment
opportunities.
35.
Authorities’ views. The authorities concurred with staff about the importance of
strengthening financial regulation and supervision. They noted that draft legislation to harmonize
and update prevailing supervision laws, which is in the last phase of the legislative process, will
enable the central bank to execute its supervisory tasks more effectively, and a new Chart of
Accounts reporting system will further strengthen the central bank’s oversight function. The
authorities expressed their deep concerns over the recent and potential further loss of CBRs and are
committed to proactively identifying and addressing vulnerabilities in the financial sector.13
Regarding the central bank’s lending to SOEs, the authorities committed to bring it to a close once
the two existing loans mature.14

STAFF APPRAISAL
36.
The economic recovery and a stronger fiscal position have helped reduce near-term
risks. Curaçao ended a three-year recession in 2015, despite the deterioration in macroeconomic
conditions in Venezuela—one of the island’s main trading partners. Expansion in Sint Maarten’s
economy continued into the fourth consecutive year, despite a modest deceleration. The Union’s
external and fiscal imbalances have also declined, with favorable external conditions and the
authorities’ fiscal consolidation efforts, but vulnerabilities to external shocks remain given its reliance
on a narrow scope of products and markets.

12

The “standing subscription” arrangement under the 2010 debt relief agreement allows the governments to borrow
at ultralow rates (Dutch levels) from the Dutch Treasury, which inadvertently caused the local market for government
securities to dry up, depriving the central bank of an important policy instrument.
13

A high level delegation (consisting of the central bank president and the ministers of finance from both islands)
visited Washington and held discussions with the U.S. officials in June 2016.
14

They are currently in discussion with a regional bank for divestment of one of the two loans before its maturity.

37.
However, risks to medium-term growth prospects remain to the downside. Continued
low growth in the euro area could have serious economic repercussions for Curaçao and Sint
Maarten through various channels, given that both islands remain heavily reliant on the euro area.
Further disruptions in Venezuela could worsen Curaçao’s growth prospects and balance of payments
if no alternative export markets are identified. Meanwhile, a loss of CBRs could hinder cross-border
transactions, adding to the macroeconomic uncertainties. In addition, slow progress in
implementing needed structural reforms also poses an important downside risk to growth prospects
going forward.
38.
Unlocking growth through economic diversification and investment promotion is
therefore imperative in this environment. In this respect, the authorities’ national development
plans are an important step toward charting a clearer direction for strategic sectors and markets and
removing impediments to private sector activity. Implementation of the plans is key, in particular, on
decisive structural reforms to improve the labor market and doing business conditions, as well as
energy sector reforms to diversify energy generation via renewable sources.
39.
A sound medium term fiscal framework will help reinforce macro stability anchored by
the fixed exchange rate. With the limited effective monetary and exchange rate policy instruments,
given the fixed exchange rate regime, fiscal policy is the authorities’ only available option to cushion
economic shocks. A sound medium term fiscal framework, equipped with clear objectives and
targets and supported by a proven track record could improve credibility, bolster investor
confidence, and promote investment.
40.
In this regard, important structural fiscal reforms are needed to further strengthen
fiscal discipline. In particular, weaknesses in tax administration and public financial management
have been identified in both islands. Staff welcome the authorities’ efforts to strengthen tax
administration to enhance revenue mobilization, improve taxpayer services, and increase tax
compliance. These are important prerequisites for future tax policy reforms contemplated by the
authorities. In addition, an action plan is greatly needed to ensure timely and decisive
implementation of measures to strengthening public financial management, in line with PEFA
assessment recommendations.
41.
Strengthened financial supervision has become more important given increasing
international scrutiny. The authorities are advised to strengthen risk-based financial supervision
and effective implementation of cross-border tax information sharing, as well as AML/CFT
frameworks in line with international standards. In a context of evolving regulatory requirements
and enforcement landscape, Curaçao and Sint Maarten’s ability to strengthen transparency,
including in Curaçao’s international financial center, will help reduce the perceived reputational risks.
A stable financial sector is also critical to supporting economic growth and private sector activities.
42.
Capacity building is needed to strengthen public institutions. Policy implementation has
been greatly challenged by capacity issues in both islands, as in most other Caribbean small states.
Investment in human capital development is critical to strengthening public institutions and

improving productivity. Staff urge the authorities to engage with their international partners in
seeking technical assistance to support capacity building.
43.
Data provision should be improved to allow adequate surveillance. The statistical offices
in both countries expressed concerns over lack of capacity, ability to hire qualified personnel, and
delays in data submission from the private sector and government entities. While some efforts have
been made to streamline data collection and digitalize surveys, staff highlights the need to allocate
additional resources to increase personnel and obtain technical assistance to address shortcomings.
44.
Staff recommends that the next Article IV Consultation discussions with the Kingdom
of the Netherlands—Curaçao and Sint Maarten be held on the 24-month consultation cycle.

The Risk Assessment Matrix (RAM) shows events that could materially alter the baseline path (the scenario most likely to materialize in the
view of IMF staff). The relative likelihood is the staff’s subjective assessment of the risks surrounding the baseline (“low” is meant to indicate a
probability below 10 percent, “medium” a probability between 10 and 30 percent, and “high” a probability between 30 and 50 percent). The
RAM reflects staff views on the source of risks and overall level of concern as of the time of discussions with the authorities. Non-mutually
exclusive risks may interact and materialize jointly. “Short term” and “medium term” are meant to indicate that the risk could materialize
within 1 year and 3 years, respectively.

Competitiveness indicators for Curaçao and Sint Maarten are mixed, highlighting current and potential
issues faced by the Union and the need for structural reforms to address impediments.
1.
Despite the same nominal peg, Curaçao and Sint Maarten’s real effective exchange
rates (REER) moved in different directions in 2015. Curaçao’s REER depreciated in 2015, largely
reflecting lower inflation relative to one of its main trading partners—Venezuela. In contrast, Sint
Maarten’s REER appreciated in 2015, given the relatively low inflation in the United States, its main
trading partner. A comparison of the REERs relative to equilibrium values suggest that Curaçao’s
REER is below its equilibrium level, while Sint Maarten’s REER shows slight overvaluation.1 However,
staff cautions that these assessments are subject to large statistical errors given limited data
availability and in some cases the quality is below that required for the standard IMF EBA-lite
assessment.

Finally, the Unions’ large current account deficits, albeit declining, and lackluster
growth underscore the need for targeted reforms to address competitiveness issues. Foreign
reserves coverage appears adequate, at 10.7 months of imports in Curaçao and 3.6 months of
imports in Sint Maarten. However, the Union’s current account deficit remains high, and has been
financed partly through growing external debt. Given the islands’ significant vulnerability to external
shocks, including natural disaster, international commodity prices, and adverse growth shocks in
trading partners among others, strengthening competitiveness and efforts to build external buffers
are critical to ensuring external sustainability and unlocking growth potential.

Annex III. Debt Sustainability Analysis
Curaçao and Sint Maarten both benefited from significant debt relief as part of the
constitutional reform in 2010, when the Netherlands took over all existing debt of
Netherlands’ Antilles in exchange of a significantly smaller amount of long term debt
issued in local currency at very low rates by the two islands. The public debt levels in the
two islands are currently low compared to regional peers. The debt paths are, however,
sensitive to adverse growth, fiscal and interest rate shocks, as well as contingent liabilities
associated with state-owned-enterprises (SOEs) and social security funds. In addition, Sint
Maarten is susceptible to natural disaster related risks, as the island sits in the Caribbean
Hurricane Belt. Overall, risks of public debt distress are assessed to be low, in light of the
current low debt levels, and the favorable maturity profile and currency composition of
debt.

A. Public Debt Sustainability Analysis
Background
Public debt remains relatively low around 35-45 percent of GDP in Curaçao and Sint Maarten,
despite the increase in recent (post-debt-relief) years. The debt relief in 2010 significantly
lowered the debt burdens of the two islands and introduced a “standing subscription” arrangement,
which allows the two island governments to access long-term borrowing in local currency at
ultralow rates from the Dutch Treasury to finance their operations. The recent increases in debt
levels in the two islands in part reflect loans issued during 2014-15 to pre-finance several large
public investment projects, while the governments have made important progress to balance their
current accounts to comply with the fiscal rules, which include a “golden rule” that permits
government borrowing only for investment.
The authorities have made important progress in consolidating the public accounts and
reducing contingent fiscal risks. Social security (including national health insurance) revenue and
expenditure have been included in the central government budget, as of 2016, and are therefore
also reflected in the baseline scenario. The authorities in both islands (particularly Curaçao) have also
made considerable progress in reducing contingent fiscal risks associated with state-ownedenterprises (see paragraph 30 in the Staff Report).

Baseline scenario and main assumptions
Gross public debt, under the baseline scenario, is projected to gradually increase over the
projection horizon to 46½ percent of GDP in 2021 (relative to 44⅓ percent in 2015) in Curaçao, as
slow economic growth persists; and to slowly decline toward 34 percent of GDP (relative to 36½
percent in 2015) in Sint Maarten with lower deficits. Despite a slight upward trend in Curaçao’s
public debt trajectory, it is expected to remain low by regional standards, and gross financing needs
are assessed to be broadly manageable.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

37

KINGDOM OF THE NETHERLANDS—CURAÇAO AND SINT MAARTEN

Real GDP growth is expected to gradually pick up to 1 percent in Curaçao and 1⅓ percent in Sint
Maarten, supported by the continuation of private and public investment projects and a moderate
increase in tourism flows. However, downside risks to medium-term growth prospects remain,
including structurally weak growth in the euro area, reduced financial services by global/regional
banks, further deterioration of macroeconomic stability in Venezuela (in the case of Curaçao), and
natural disasters (in the case of Sint Maarten), among others (see Annex I in the Staff Report).
Inflation is also expected to increase to around 2⅓ percent in Curaçao and 2¾ percent in Sint
Maarten over the medium term, as the deflationary impact of the current low international oil prices
dissipates and domestic demand gradually recovers.
The fiscal position, on current policies is expected to slowly improve in both islands over the
latter part of the projection horizon, as large public investment projects begin to wind down and the
authorities continue their efforts on increasing revenues. However, going forward, close expenditure
management and strict budget execution will be needed to ensure compliance with the fiscal rules.
The current fiscal policy framework could be further strengthened through the adoption of a
medium term fiscal framework to ensure fiscal and debt sustainability, while providing policy
cushion and flexibility to accommodate potential external shocks.
Market Access is assumed to remain adequate to cover fiscal deficits and maturing debt under the
presumption that the current low cost “standing subscription” borrowing arrangement with the
Netherlands (under the Cft’s oversight) will remain in place throughout the projection horizon.
However, interest rates are projected to gradually increase over time, in line with the forecast for the
Netherlands’ long-term borrowing costs.

Shocks and stress tests
Growth shock. In an adverse growth shock scenario with lower output growth of one standard
deviation for 2 years starting 2017, the debt-to-GDP ratio would increase by 3⅓ percentage points
in Curaçao and by 6 percentage points in Sint Maarten compared to the baseline.
Primary balance shock. A temporary shock equivalent to one-half of standard deviation in 2017-18
would entail a deterioration of 3⅓ percent of GDP in the primary balance in Curaçao and 1¾
percent in Sint Maarten. Accordingly, the debt-to-GDP ratio would increase by about 7 percent in
Curaçao and 3 percent in Sint Maarten, as a result of the higher gross financing needs than in the
baseline scenario.
Interest rate shock. The standard interest rate shock is expected to have relatively moderate impact
over the projection horizon given the islands’ favorable maturity profile with most borrowing at
fixed rates and low refinancing needs. Combined with a permanent increase in the nominal interest
rate by 300 bps starting 2019 (assuming the low cost “standing subscription” arrangement will lapse
following the 2018 review of the Cft oversight), public debt would expand by 0.6 percent of GDP
higher in Curaçao and by 0.1 percent of GDP higher in Sint Maarten, compared with the baseline
scenario, which assumes the “standing subscription” arrangement will remain.

Combined macro-fiscal shock. A combination of the above shocks would bring the debt gradually
up to 56 percent of GDP in Curaçao and 41 percent of GDP in Sint Maarten, and would continue to
rise thereafter.
Customized shocks. Two customized shock scenarios are simulated for Curaçao and Sint Maarten
respectively:


Venezuela shock (for Curaçao). Under an extreme shock scenario, in which 1) Curaçao’s trade and
tourism links with Venezuela are completely removed starting from 2017 and 2) the refinery
business completely stops in 2019 after the current lease expires (i.e. not renewed), Curaçao’s
debt-to-GDP ratio would increase by 7¾ percent over the baseline scenario.



Natural disaster shock (for Sint Maarten). Given lack of detailed data on historical disaster
damages and reconstruction-related government expenditure, a hypothetical disaster in 2017 is
simulated. The shock, which assumes a one-time 10 percent of GDP increase in government
expenditure to cover post-disaster reconstruction needs, would lead to an increase in the debt
level by an amount similar to the size of the shock.

B. External Debt Sustainability Analysis
Financing needs to cover the Union’s large current account deficits will push up gross external
debt over the medium term. Under the baseline scenario, the gross external debt would increase
from around 94 percent of GDP in 2015 to over 106 percent of GDP by 2019 before beginning a
gradual decline. This forecast is based on the same assumptions for macroeconomic variables as per
the baseline macroeconomic framework. In particular, average non-debt creating FDI is assumed to
be about 3⅓ percent of GDP a year, compared with an average of 2½ percent of GDP over the past
decade, reflecting a gradual pickup in tourism-related investment as global tourism demand
increases. As such, current account deficits are also expected to gradually narrow over the medium
term, largely due to an increase in the demand for the Union’s tourism services.
The Union’s external debt is sensitive to adverse current account or depreciation shocks, but
is relatively resilient to an interest rate or growth shock. The shock scenarios find the gross
external debt would increase by 16 percent of GDP by 2021 with a current account deficit path onehalf of standard deviation above the baseline, and by 31 percent of GDP with a 30 percent real
depreciation (given a large share of the Union’s external debt is denominated in the local currency).
A full assessment of external debt sustainability is, however, hampered by lack of information on the
Union’s international investment positions, in particular its foreign assets.

C. Conclusions
With the current low levels and favorable dynamics of Curaçao and Sint Maarten’s public and
external debt, the DSA finds the risk of debt distress low, but the debt paths are sensitive to
shocks. While remaining relatively low levels compared with most of its regional peers, Curaçao’s
public debt is expected to gradually increase under the baseline scenario, posing a risk to the
INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

island’s long term debt sustainability. As such, staff has proposed a medium term fiscal framework
that aims to gradually reduce and stabilize Curaçao’s public debt (see paragraph 27 in the Staff
Report). Besides, both islands’ public and external debt are found to be vulnerable to shocks, which
calls for the authorities’ sustained efforts and decisive reforms to strengthen their fiscal framework,
build policy buffers, improve external competitiveness, and unlock growth potential.

400 and 600 basis points for bond spreads; 17 and 25 percent of GDP for external financing requirement; 1 and 1.5 percent for change in the share of short-term debt; 30 and 45
percent for the public debt held by non-residents.
4/ Long-term bond spread over German bonds, an average over the last 3 months, 02-Oct-15 through 31-Dec-15.
5/ External financing requirement is defined as the sum of current account deficit, amortization of medium and long-term total external debt, and short-term total external debt at
the end of previous period.

1/ Public sector is defined as general government.
2/ Based on available data.
3/ Long-term bond spread over German bonds.
4/ Defined as interest payments divided by debt stock (excluding guarantees) at the end of previous year.
5/ Derived as [(r - π(1+g) - g + ae(1+r)]/(1+g+π+gπ)) times previous period debt ratio, with r = interest rate; π = growth rate of GDP deflator; g = real GDP growth rate;
a = share of foreign-currency denominated debt; and e = nominal exchange rate depreciation (measured by increase in local currency value of U.S. dollar).
6/ The real interest rate contribution is derived from the numerator in footnote 5 as r - π (1+g) and the real growth contribution as -g.
7/ The exchange rate contribution is derived from the numerator in footnote 5 as ae(1+r).
8/ Includes asset changes and interest revenues (if any). For projections, includes exchange rate changes during the projection period.
9/ Assumes that key variables (real GDP growth, real interest rate, and other identified debt-creating flows) remain at the level of the last projection year.

ANNEX IV. Curaçao’s Exposure to a Potential Economic Disruption in
Venezuela
As one of Curaçao’s main trading partners, the worsening economic situation in Venezuela
poses major risks to Curaçao’s growth prospects. With a market share of 33 percent for exports
and 21 percent for imports (see figure 1), a potential economic collapse in Venezuela could lead to
serious economic repercussions for the island’s near and medium-term outlook.

Trade disruptions with Venezuela pose a serious threat to Curaçao through various channels,
including tourism, transportation, the free-zone, and the refinery. Tourism expenditure of
Venezuelan tourists (18.9 percent of total) also declined, as more of them are traveling to Curaçao to
obtain U.S. dollars that they can exchange for bolivars in their home country instead of for leisure. In
the transportation industry, the unstable economic situation and currency restrictions in Venezuela
seem to have affected this sector particularly

To assess the impact of a potential Venezuelan economic collapse on Curaçao’s real GDP, a
shock scenario is estimated for 2014 in which all trade transactions between the two countries
are removed.1 As seen in Figure 2 (blue bar), a discontinuation in all trade transactions with
Venezuela would have resulted in a larger GDP contraction of 10.7 percent in 2014 (a 9.6 percent
drop from the actual figure of -1.1 percent). More especially, the contraction would have been
exacerbated by a decline in net foreign demand as a result of lower exports of goods, primarily from
an annulment of the refining fee, a decline in air transportation to Venezuela, a drop in harbor
activities, and a loss of foreign exchange revenues from free-zone re-exports and tourism
expenditures. In addition, a halt in activities at the refinery could cause lay-offs and an interruption
of private investment projects.
A different shock scenario analysis that excludes Isla Refinery in 2019 shows that Curaçao has
a high risk exposure towards a potential economic collapse in Venezuela. There is no doubt
that over the past few years, some sectors of the economy have already been affected by the
economic instability and currency restrictions in Venezuela. Consequently, with the recent dramatic
drop in international oil prices and further

of a collapse.

The 2014 simulation, in which all trade transactions between Curaçao and Venezuela are removed, is based on
Central Bank’s estimates and set of assumptions. Assumptions include the discontinuation of all refining activities,
transportation services, tourist arrivals, oil imports, non-oil merchandise imports, and re-exports by the free-zone
companies to Venezuela, and ceteris paribus. Similarly, the 2019 shock scenario relies on data provided by the
Central Bank, complemented by IMF staff calculations.

ANNEX V. Risks Related to Pensions and Social Security
Curaçao and Sint Maarten have taken important steps to allay short term risks related to
pensions funds, however, residual risks must be addressed to ensure long term sustainability.
Sluggish growth, rising healthcare costs, and an aging population underscore the need to address
inefficiencies in pension funds, and the social security system to ensure continued fiscal and debt
sustainability.
Despite some successful reforms to Curaçao’s basic pension system in 20131, it remains
underfunded. The reforms included an increase in the retirement age from 60 years to 65 years,
with a transition period of 3 years. The transition period ended recently, so there are no new retirees
expected this year after February. The shortfall is, however, expected to remain in the near term,
reflecting continued high unemployment and low growth. Recommendations made during the 2014
Article IV Consultation discussions included extending the pension reforms to public sector workers.
At the time pension benefits were indexed to inflation. Since then the authorities have implemented
reforms to ensure the sustainability of the public pensions, including by granting increases to
pensioners only when the pension fund backing is over 105 percent and civil servants receive a
salary increase.
Benefits related to healthcare remain the largest fiscal risk, reflecting inefficiencies in
healthcare delivery. Of note, medical doctors are for the most part not employed by the hospital
and have private practices, limiting cost savings from pooling resources. Only recently are new
doctors required to work for the hospital. While premiums are considered high, rising costs and an
aging population underscore the need to increase contributions through higher employment and
improved compliance. The authorities have reduced old-age pension benefits to persons living
outside Curaçao and are looking at further cuts to help reduce the shortfall. They are also
considering a further increase in the retirement age (to 67 years).
A 2015 ALM study exposed underfunding in three funds managed by Sint Maarten’s Social
Security Bank (SSB), the Sickness Insurance, OV (Accident) Insurance, and the Retired Civil
Servants Sickness funds. Low compliance, in the region of 60 to 65 percent, was highlighted as the
main factor behind underfunding. On the expenditure side, high medical costs and waste in the
pharmaceutical industry have also contributed to underfunding. The SSB is currently in the process
of increasing its audit capacity, and automating systems to help reduce fraud. These measures are
expected to improve compliance to 75 percent over the near term.
A recent audit of pension assets suggests underfunding of 95 percent at end 2015. Notably,
eliminating arrears, including from the government, would improve the funded-status to 102
percent, in line with the pension fund, APS’s target. The APS is exploring a number of local
investments, including in the tourism and housing sectors to improve the return on assets. The age
of retirement will be increased to 62 years, effective July 2016. The authorities are currently in

discussions with unions and other stakeholders towards implementing further pension reform, by
2018, to improve the viability of the pension fund and reduce the required contribution of the
government.
Risks going forward relate to increasing healthcare costs and aging. These increasing cost also
reflect the cost of sending persons abroad for treatment not available in the country. Notably, the
Sint Maarten authorities are exploring a joint working relationship with St. Martin, which could allow
for lower costs and a more efficient provision of healthcare.

ANNEX VI. Curaçao’s Offshore Financial Sector
The termination of a U.S. tax treaty and the adoption of the New Fiscal Framework have led
to gradual erosion of Curaçao’s offshore financial sector. The post-war U.S.–Antilles tax treaty
provided an opportunity for U.S. companies to avoid the withholding tax on interest payments to
non-residents by setting up subsidiaries in Curaçao, which would issue Eurobonds in the London
market and relend to their American parent. The tax treaty was terminated in 1998, and, as a result,
Curaçao’s offshore financial sector experienced a sharp decline as it lost much of its attraction for
many customers. Shortly after, Curaçao adopted the “New Fiscal Framework (NFF)” in 2001, to avert
inclusion on the OECD’s threatened “black-list”. The NFF abolished the ring-fenced treatment of
offshore companies and nonresident investors, who were given preferential tax treatment. A
grandfathering transition period (until 2019) was given to existing offshore companies; however,
fears were created that many of these companies would abandon Curaçao after 2019.
Recent deterioration in the macroeconomic conditions in Venezuela also appears to have
negatively affected the sector. There are several Venezuela-based international institutions
registered in Curaçao, including 11 offshore banks (out of total 31 in Curaçao, but their assets share
is not significant). It is reported that the recent disruptions in Venezuela have caused a loss of
Venezuelan customers, although the direct impact cannot be easily qualified at this moment.
These changes have, however, created an opportunity to transition the sector. Curaçao’s
offshore financial sector survived these changes, albeit in weakened form, but the size of the sector
has gradually diminished. The sector was the main foreign exchange provider in 2000, but it ranked
at eighth position in 2012 according to the central bank, with its contribution shrunk from around 30
percent of total FX revenue to a single digit. Against rising international scrutiny on offshore
financial centers, the authorities are rebranding the sector toward a destination for back-office type
services for international companies.

STATISTICAL ISSUES
I. Curaçao and Sint Maarten: Assessment of Data Adequacy for Surveillance
General: Data provision has serious shortcomings that significantly hamper surveillance. National
accounts data have large lags, dating back to 2006. There are no data on GDP deflators or real GDP.
Data on fiscal expenditures for both countries continue to be on cash basis, complicating the
assessment of fiscal policy. Fiscal reporting standards need improvement, including the adoption of
the Government Financial Statistics Manual (GFS). The current account deficit could possibly be
mismeasured given limitations in the statistical infrastructure. Lastly, there are no data on the two
countries’ international investment position.
National accounts: Data are compiled by the respective Central Bureau of Statistics (CBS) in both
Curaçao and Sint Maarten. Expenditure-side national accounts components have been published only
up to 2011 in Curaçao and 2006 in Sint Maarten, while there is still no production-side data. Detailed
price indices to deflate national accounts aggregates are not available. The statistical offices and
Central Bank continue to use the total consumer price index (CPI) to deflate nominal GDP, which gives
rise to potential distortions in the measurement of real growth.
Price statistics: CPI data are compiled and published on a monthly basis but measures of core
inflation are not readily available, particularly for Sint Maarten.
Government finance statistics: The Ministry of Finance in Curaçao provides fiscal data that can
broadly be bridged to the cash framework of the GFSM format. However, the fiscal reporting standards
in Sint Maarten are significantly weaker than in Curaçao, and improvements are needed in converging
and consolidating fiscal data according to the GFSM manual. Final data on the 2016 fiscal budget for
both countries have only become available during the mission, complicating timely fiscal policy
assessment.
Monetary statistics: The methodology used by the Central Bank of Curaçao and Sint Maarten (CBCS)
for compiling monetary statistics is broadly consistent with the IMF Monetary and Financial Statistics
Manual. However, monetary and financial indicators are only available for the Union.
Balance of payments: Balance of payments (BOP) statistics are reported on a transactions basis in
accordance with the sixth edition of the BOP Manual. The CBCS reports quarterly BOP data. No data on
intra-currency union flows is available. Monthly data on the official reserves position are published with
a lag of one month. The diversified and changing structure of the offshore sector makes an
appropriate classification of capital account inflows and outflows problematic. Areas requiring
improvement include: a) maturity schedules for private sector external debt, b) more detailed
information on individual financing components; c) information on intra-union flows, and d) data on
net international investment positions.
II. Data Standards and Quality
Not a General Data Dissemination System participant.

No data ROSC is available.
