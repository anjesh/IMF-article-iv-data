REPUBLIC OF AZERBAIJAN
STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2011 ARTICLE IV CONSULTATION
December 20, 2011

KEY ISSUES
Context
A strong recovery of the non-hydrocarbon economy has offset a decline in oil output in
2011, but inflation pressures could emerge in 2012. The high oil fund savings should
provide for an adequate buffer against a potential global shock.

Focus of consultation and recommendations
Diversifying the economy away from hydrocarbons and generating sustainable and inclusive
growth, while preserving macro-financial stability. Staff recommends:



Restraining budgetary spending to contain demand pressures that could emerge
in the near term, and committing to medium-term fiscal consolidation to allow
better sharing of hydrocarbon wealth across generations;



Allowing greater exchange rate flexibility to counter inflation and lower output
volatility, and strengthening monetary policy over the medium term;



Strengthening supervision and taking steps to deepen the financial system;
promptly addressing issues at the systemically important public bank;



Improving the business environment and eliminating governance constraints on
the private sector, especially for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs).

Previous Consultation
During the 2010 Article IV Consultation discussion, Directors stressed the need to preserve
macroeconomic stability by securing fiscal sustainability; gradually exiting from crisis-related
liquidity support; strengthening bank supervision and reforming the financial sector and the
business environment. Since then, the authorities have adopted some macro-prudential
measures and taken steps to improve the business climate. However, fiscal consolidation
has not commenced and liquidity support to state enterprises and regulatory forbearance
towards the systemic state bank have continued.

2011 ARTICLE IV REPORT

REPUBLIC OF AZERBAIJAN

BACKGROUND AND CONTEXT
1.

Azerbaijan’s economy has grown
rapidly since the onset of the ongoing
oil boom in 2003, and fared well
through the 2009 global crisis. Non-oil
economic growth -averaged 13 percent in
2006–08. During the 2008–09 global shock,
a fiscal stimulus and a stable exchange rate
helped prevent non-oil growth from falling
below 3 percent. The Central Bank of
Azerbaijan (CBA) provided support to state
enterprises, including provision for losses
on investments abroad. Non-oil growth
recovered to 7½ percent in 2010.

recently, and inequality has also fallen.
Gains in employment and wages and
transfers through targeted social programs
have contributed to these positive social
outcomes.
3.

Notwithstanding those
achievements, the following actions are
needed to preserve macro-financial
stability and promote sustainable and
inclusive growth:



Removing the obstacles in the business
environment and governance that
constrain private sector–led growth,
especially for SMEs;



Conducting countercyclical fiscal policy
while making the oil wealth available for
future generations;



Reducing the level and volatility of
inflation; and



Fostering financial intermediation and
deepening, and promptly addressing
issues at International Bank of Azerbaijan
(IBA) to maintain near-term financial
stability.

nearing potential by end–2011. Nonhydrocarbon growth is expected at
6 percent in 2012.

REPUBLIC OF AZERBAIJAN

Oil output fell sharply in 2011 because of
maintenance problems and shortfalls in
the delivery of new wells. The volume of
hydrocarbon output could remain broadly
the same next year, and over the next
decade, before beginning to fall
thereafter. As the price of a barrel of oil
equivalent of Azerbaijani natural gas is
about ¼ of oil prices, the increase in
wealth associated with recent natural gas
discoveries is significantly less than is
implied by the volume increase.

scenario) and non-hydrocarbon output
beginning to exceed potential (see Box 1).

Inflation surged to 9.5 percent in
February, but fell to 6.8 percent in
October, mainly reflecting global food
price developments. However, it could rise
to 8 percent by end-2011 with planned
public spending (under staff baseline

The manat exchange rate has been

Fiscal policy. Staff projects the nonhydrocarbon deficit to be 44 percent of
non-hydrocarbon GDP in 2011, from
38 percent in 2010. The spending
envisaged under the 2012 draft budget
could increase it to above 50 percent,
significantly raising the breakeven oil
price. Recent high spending has also
worsened fiscal sustainability.

Box 1. Azerbaijan: Inflation, Food Prices, and Output Gap
Food prices strongly influence headline
inflation in Azerbaijan and spill over to core
inflation. A 10 percent change in international
food prices changes domestic food prices by about
3.2 percent. An exercise by IMF staff that splits the
officially-recorded core inflation into (i) an
underlying core (related to the output gap) and (ii)
the spillover of food price inflation to expectations,
suggests that about ¾ of the movement in core
inflation in recent years was because of the latter.
Azerbaijan: Inflation Dynamics
(y-o-y, percent)

In 2012, inflation could be increasingly driven
by domestic demand. An output gap model
suggests some slack in the non-hydrocarbon
economy in 2011; but this gap is expected to close
by end–year if supplementary fiscal spending is
executed. With international food price growth
moderating in the period ahead, headline inflation
will be increasingly influenced by public spending–
fueled domestic demand pressures.

Monetary policy. As recovery took hold
and there were signs of spillovers from
rising global food prices on domestic
inflation in early 2011, policy interest rates
and reserve requirements were raised.
Market rates, however, have been
unresponsive and credit growth has
remained sluggish (monetary transmission
through policy rates is weak in the
absence of well developed money and
bond markets). The availability of
securities for conducting monetary policy
is also limited.



Financial indicators of the banking
system excluding IBA appear stable.
Return on assets is recovering and capital
exceeds 20 percent of risk–weighted
assets. Nonperforming loans (NPLs)
increased during the 2008–09 crisis,
though it is unclear whether the cycle has
peaked yet (disclosed NPL figures might
be understated, as only the overdue
portion of principal and interest is
reported as NPL).



While spillovers from the 2008–09 global
financial crisis did not affect Azerbaijani
banks, CBA bailed out troubled state
enterprises through commercial banks,
mainly to ease difficulties in rolling over
short-term foreign liabilities. This credit
has risen to about 5½ percent of
projected non-hydrocarbon GDP and 20
percent of CBA’s projected 2011 GIR,
despite a strong economic recovery.

A recent audit has confirmed capital
adequacy and liquidity issues at the
systemic public bank IBA (arising
primarily from a deterioration in asset
quality). While the authorities hired
consultants to devise a privatization
strategy, there has been little progress in
this area over the last decade.

Risks emanate from oil prices and
regional developments, but can be
mitigated by the large foreign assets
cushion. While Azerbaijan does not rely
heavily on non-oil exports and
remittances (these account for less than
10 percent of current account receipts),
these links are primarily with CIS
countries. Evidence from 2009 suggests
that a regional slowdown could affect
Azerbaijan’s non-hydrocarbon economy.
Nevertheless, foreign assets should
provide sufficient buffer against future

shocks, including to a sustained and sharp
decline in the oil price to 50 dollars per
barrel. Under this crisis scenario, nonhydrocarbon GDP growth could slow to
4 percent over the medium term and, if
government spending is unchanged from
the baseline scenario, could entail a
substantial draw down of oil fund savings.
Continued impasse on the NagornoKarabakh conflict could adversely affect
the country’s ability to attract nonhydrocarbon FDI over the medium term.

7.

Non-hydrocarbon growth and
poverty reduction have been largely
driven by high public spending. Since
the beginning of the oil boom, the nonhydrocarbon economy has become
symbiotically dependent on public
expenditures, with a sizable portion of the
private non-farm sector reliant on
government contracts, directly or
indirectly. The gains in poverty reduction

service sector growth, which in turn has
benefited from heavy public capital
spending.

would have to generate adequate
employment, including through trade. The
business environment and governance
would have to be improved and the social
protection net widened. On the former,
reforms that enhance competition, ease
trade barriers, and facilitate a SME access
to finance would be key (Box 3). While the
recent introduction of e-Government and
one-stop windows for business would
help, anti-corruption efforts need to be
broadened and sustained.

Box 2. Azerbaijan: The Inclusiveness of Growth1
Poverty and inequality have declined rapidly during
2001–08 because of gains in employment, wages
and productivity and social transfers (though official
data indicate only a small drop in the unemployment
rate). The poverty rate has fallen by more than
30 percentage points to 15 percent, and the Gini
inequality index has declined by 8 percent to 34
percent. Both these achievements are made even more
impressive by the fact that one in nine persons in
Azerbaijan is internally displaced by the NagornoKarabakh conflict. The officially-recorded
unemployment rate fell by only 3 percent during the
period, raising doubts about the quality of such
statistics and the definition of employment.2 Household
survey data suggest a substantial tightening of the
labor market since the onset of the boom—average
hours worked in non-agricultural jobs increased to 43
per week in 2008, from 38 in 2001, and real wages rose
sharply.

Social protection is well targeted to the poor,
though the coverage is narrow. The country does not
rely on generalized subsidies on foods or fuels. Instead,
there is a well–targeted assistance program (TSA)
which, while having narrow coverage, has low “leakage”
to the non-poor (with about half the benefits flowing to
the bottom decile of the population).

Box 3. Azerbaijan: Business Environment and Governance
Azerbaijan ranks well globally on rules and regulations associated with business climate (e.g. on the World
Bank’s Doing Business), though significant challenges remain. Businesses report problems with local
competition intensity and trade barriers. Weak financial infrastructure, such as the absence of a credit
bureau, affects SMEs’ access to finance. Governance is a particular concern. Notwithstanding some
improvement in the past decade, the country ranks poorly on overall governance-related indicators (in the
bottom third, globally), and it does particularly poorly on corruption.

B. Fiscal Policy: Reconciling Near and Medium-Term Challenges
10.

11.

12.

12

In recent years, fiscal policy has
been pro-cyclical and has, as a result,
built up risks to macroeconomic
stability. Prior to 2012, the annual budget
process had established appropriate levels
of spending and oil fund saving. However,
recent unanticipated increases in global oil
prices have triggered supplemental
government spending—mostly on capital
projects. Combined with weakening tax
discipline, this additional spending has
sharply raised the non-hydrocarbon
primary deficit and the 2012 consolidated
budget bill, if fully implemented, would
further raise this deficit, to more than
50 percent of non-hydrocarbon GDP.
Fiscal consolidation would be
necessary in 2012 to avoid inflationary
pressures. With output expected to have
reached potential in late 2011, the large
fiscal expansion planned for 2012 would
lead to overheating pressures. Staff
assumptions under the baseline scenario
(Text Table and Table 4) support that a
lower non-hydrocarbon deficit relative to
the level envisaged in the draft budget—
by about 10 percentage points of nonhydrocarbon GDP—would be consistent
with the economy’s absorptive capacity
and macroeconomic stability, and would
still allow for sizable investment spending.
Finite hydrocarbon resources and
the need to achieve fiscal sustainability
necessitate a commitment to mediumterm fiscal consolidation. A sizable share
of oil revenues should be saved to ensure
that the benefits of hydrocarbon wealth
are shared equitably across generations.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

To provide an anchor for consolidation
efforts the government could employ a
permanent-income fiscal rule, whereby it
consumes a constant return on net
hydrocarbon wealth. The rule would
suggest a reduction of the nonhydrocarbon deficit from 44 percent of
non-hydrocarbon GDP in 2011 to about
20 percent by 2017–18. Committing to a
medium-term budget framework with
indicative annual targets for the nonhydrocarbon fiscal deficit could help build
public support for fiscal consolidation.

Reforms of revenues and investment
spending could underpin medium-term
consolidation efforts. Non-hydrocarbon
revenues can be boosted, without raising
tax rates, by streamlining exemptions,
applying tax procedures uniformly and
enhancing private–sector competition
(Box 4). The ongoing modernization of the

introduction of online filing, will help.
Recent progress in increasing budget
transparency should be supplemented with
efforts to improve weaknesses in the

The authorities understand the role
fiscal policy plays in maintaining
macroeconomic stability, and intend to
adjust infrastructure spending if demand
pressures emerge. However, they also
emphasized the need to spend over the
next two years on critical infrastructure and
other large projects (such as the Eurovision
Song Contest) which will speed up the
upgrading of public facilities, and plan to
reduce such spending thereafter. They
acknowledge the need to improve the
selection and appraisal of public

C. Monetary and Exchange Rate Policies: Dealing Effectively with Inflation
15.

The exchange rate could play a more
active role in dealing with near-term
inflation pressures emanating from
increases in public spending. With a de
facto stabilized exchange rate, CBA has
struggled to contain pressures emanating
from fiscal spending and external shocks.
Monetary tightening would be warranted
in 2012 if demand pressures emerge and a
move toward greater exchange rate
flexibility than exists today could help
alleviate such pressures, as would the

introduction of a sufficiently wide
exchange rate band (see Box 5). The
economy’s competitiveness can be
adequately preserved by containing real
exchange rate appreciation through
keeping inflation low and stable rather
than by resisting appreciation of the
nominal exchange rate.

2011 ARTICLE IV REPORT

Box 5. Azerbaijan: Exchange Rate Policy—Insights from a DSGE Model1
The model—calibrated and tailored to a small
hydrocarbon economy with limited international
capital interaction—suggests that a flexible
exchange rate would entail lower macroeconomic
costs (to inflation and output) than a fixed rate. By
following a more flexible exchange rate than it
currently does, the CBA could better mitigate the
negative impacts of shocks emanating from changes
in global oil prices and government spending, even
under fiscal dominance. Given the limited financial
intermediation and a paucity of instruments to
hedge against exchange rate volatility, managed
flexibility may be appropriate over the near term.

Over the medium term, further
strengthening of monetary policy tools
would be key to better controlling
inflation. A move away from the exchange
rate as the nominal anchor, and greater
reliance on interest rates and a more
flexible exchange rate—would lower the
volatility of output and inflation in the face
of shocks (see Selected Issues Note,
“Exchange Rate Policy and Macroeconomic
Costs in Azerbaijan”). While greater
exchange rate flexibility than exists today

could help in the near term with inflation, a
move to fuller exchange rate flexibility
would require several actions. These
include developing securities market (even
in the absence of a need for financing);
introducing currency risk mitigation
instruments; deepening the interbank
credit market; reducing distortions in
interest rates and pricing of government
securities; and improving the coordination
between monetary and fiscal policies.

Staff estimates do not suggest a
misalignment of the real effective
exchange rate. The Macroeconomic
Balance and the PPP approaches suggest

an overvaluation, whereas the external
sustainability and equilibrium real
exchange rate approaches point to an
undervaluation (See Box 6).

Box 6. Azerbaijan: Exchange Rate Assessment
The manat REER appreciated substantially during
the oil boom, but there is no concrete evidence
of loss of competitiveness. With a fixed nominal
exchange rate, adjustment in the REER has come
mainly from changes in domestic inflation. Between
early 2004 and late 2008—the peak of the oil
boom—the REER appreciated by about 78 percent.
Following a sharp drop in inflation after the global
financial crisis, it has been broadly steady since late
2008. Notwithstanding the substantial real
appreciation, the evidence on changes in
competitiveness is mixed. While non-hydrocarbon
exports have declined in relation to nonhydrocarbon GDP, Azerbaijan has been able to
increase its share in global non-hydrocarbon
exports.

D. Financial Sector: Managing Risks while Enabling the Sector to Support
Private Sector–Led Growth
With weak intermediation and high
concentration, the banking system is
not well placed to support private
sector–led growth. The sector is
characterized by low deposit and credit in
relation to the size of the economy, and
domination by a large public bank, IBA. In
addition, SMEs have lower access to

finance than in many comparator
countries, and microfinance lending is
small (see Box 3).
20.

IBA’s soundness needs to be
improved without delay, while
preserving financial stability. Findings of
the recent audit underscore the need to
promptly strengthen the bank’s liquidity
and capital. To avoid exposing the central
bank’s balance sheet, liquidity support to
IBA should be collateralized, and
government recapitalization of the bank
undertaken in line with implementation of
a clear action plan to restore the bank to
good health. IBA should limit additional
financing from abroad, as such borrowing
imposes contingent liability on sovereign
resources. The appointment of consultants
to devise a privatization strategy for IBA is
a welcome step. Future plans should
include ways to reduce IBA’s systemic
importance, and privatization undertaken
transparently and with a clear timetable.

should be strengthened and applied
more proactively. The recent adoption of
macro–prudential regulations, such as a
leverage ratio—to prevent a rapid credit
boom of the kind seen prior to the 2009
global crisis—and an increase in reserve
requirement on foreign exchange deposits,
should help reduce risks in the financial
system. Enforcement of CBA supervision
and prudential regulations should be
applied uniformly across all banks,
including the IBA.

(e. g., enforcement of contracts and setting
up a credit bureau), particularly to enhance
the role of SMEs. Ongoing efforts,
including those undertaken in
collaboration with the World Bank, to
strengthen capital markets with the
objective of developing long-term
instruments for savers and investors, are
appropriate.

CBA should unwind its support to
state enterprises. It should narrowly limit
its role to that of a “lender of last resort”
for financial institutions. Support for
troubled state enterprises should come
directly from the budget.
Enhancing banking competition and
deepening financial markets are key. As
IBA accounts for 44 percent of system
deposits, its persistent problems have
hindered financial development in
Azerbaijan. Offloading and downsizing IBA
would bring the additional benefits of
leveling the playing field across banks and
enhancing financial intermediation.
Encouraging the consolidation of private
banks, particularly small ones, into
competitive entities would also enhance
competition. There is also a need to

STAFF APPRAISAL
26.

27.

Until recently, Azerbaijan’s strong
economic performance has benefited
from prudent economic policies. Since
the early 2000s, government policies have
contributed to keeping non-hydrocarbon
growth high and the macroeconomic
environment relatively stable. The policy of
transparently saving a sizable portion of oil
revenues has enabled the economy to
avoid the adverse consequences of
harvesting natural resources. In addition,
non-hydrocarbon growth and welltargeted social assistance have contributed
to significant reduction in poverty and
inequality.
Nevertheless, significant actions
would be needed for Azerbaijan to
maintain the record of high growth and
significant poverty reduction. Given the
limited horizon of hydrocarbon resources,
the economy needs to be reoriented from
its symbiotic dependence on natural
resource revenues. An important
prerequisite for a successful transition to
economic diversification and private
sector–led growth is to improve
governance and the business environment.
The authorities’ recent steps in this regard
are welcome, but the anticorruption
campaign needs to be extended widely
and pursued resolutely. To improve the
business climate, trade barriers should be
eased and regulations made less restrictive
with a view to enhancing competition.

28.

Fiscal policy should be delinked
from the global oil price cycle.
Supplemental public spending, driven by
changes in hydrocarbon prices, has
exposed the economy to volatility and
posed risks to macroeconomic stability.
With the non-hydrocarbon economy
recovering strongly and government
spending likely to result in demand
pressures in 2012, the non-hydrocarbon
deficit should be lowered. The intra-year
execution of government spending should
be made less uncertain and more even.

29.

Finite hydrocarbon resources
underscore the need to achieve
medium–term fiscal sustainability. The
authorities understand the need to
undertake medium-term fiscal
consolidation, but near-term demands on
public resources, especially for
infrastructure and other large-project
spending, have, to date, trumped longer–
term considerations. The non-hydrocarbon
fiscal stance in 2011 has worsened fiscal
sustainability, and the 2012 draft budget
could exacerbate it further. Fiscal
consolidation should commence now, and
there is considerable scope for trimming
capital expenditures and boosting nonhydrocarbon revenues over the medium
term. To build public support for the
consolidation effort, the authorities could
employ indicative annual targets on the
non-hydrocarbon fiscal deficit. They should
also strengthen the process underlying the

20

A tightening of monetary policy,
through allowing greater exchange rate
flexibility, may also be needed if
demand pressures emerge. The de facto
stabilized exchange rate has limited the
effectiveness of monetary policy. Allowing
greater exchange rate flexibility by
employing a sufficiently wide exchange
rate band would help contain inflation, and
should be supplemented with other
monetary policy tools, such as interest
rates. However, staff does support the
authorities’ view that the exchange rate
should not be used to absorb the shocks
from an uneven and uncertain pattern of
public spending. The monetary policy
framework needs to be strengthened to
better counter inflation over the medium
term, and in addition to helping develop
the associated infrastructure (e.g. debt
markets), the central bank should improve

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

the communication of monetary and
exchange rate policies with the public.
31.

Addressing financial sector
weaknesses is key for supporting
sustainable and inclusive growth.
Effectively dealing with IBA would help
maintain financial stability, contribute to
transforming the financial sector by
unlocking its resources and improving
efficiency. To level the playing field and
enhance competition, IBA should be
downsized, and smaller banks encouraged
to consolidate into competitive entities.
Steps should also be taken to enhance
SME access to finance. To minimize conflict

financial institutions.

It is expected that the next Article IV
consultation with Azerbaijan will be held

2011 ARTICLE IV REPORT

Annex I. Azerbaijan: External Debt Sustainability Assessment
External debt is low and risks of debt distress over the medium term are similarly low.
External debt has declined substantially since the onset of the oil boom, halving by 20 percentage points to
about 21 percent in 2010 relative to 2004. This reflects, in large part, rapid real GDP growth and the
government’s decision to finance domestic investment projects from oil revenue.
Under the baseline scenario, external debt is projected to decline slightly to about 15 percent of GDP by 2016,
mainly from increasing non-oil FDI (attracted by progress on structural reforms and substantial strengthening
of the non-oil fiscal position).
Azerbaijan’s external debt appears resilient to most adverse external shocks.
Bound tests suggest that under standard shocks to interest rates, growth, and real exchange rate, external debt
will remain relatively low, at less than 26 percent of GDP by 2016.
External debt, however, could increase rapidly, to about 65 percent, if there were a standard shock to the noninterest external current account.
If key variables, including real GDP growth and current account surplus, remain at the historical 10–year
average (15 percent and 7 percent of GDP, respectively), external debt would continue to decline rapidly
relative to the baseline scenario. But given the prospects for oil production and prices, this scenario seems
unlikely.

Annex II. Azerbaijan: Public Debt Sustainability Assessment
Public debt is small, thus, risks of debt distress in the medium–term are low.
Public debt has declined substantially since the onset of the oil boom, halving to about 11 percent in 2010,
relative to 2004. As in the case of external debt, this reflects rapid real GDP growth and the government’s
decision to finance domestic investment projects from oil revenue.
Under the baseline scenario, public debt is projected to remain broadly unchanged at about 10 percent of GDP
by 2016. The scenario assumes substantial efforts to consolidate the non-oil fiscal position and reduced
spending on investment financed with oil resources.
Azerbaijan’s public debt appears resilient to most adverse shocks.
Bound tests suggest that under standard shocks to interest rates, primary balance, and real exchange rate,
public debt would remain relatively manageable at about 25 percent of GDP or less by 2016.
However, the public debt ratio seems more vulnerable to shocks to real growth than the external debt, as
under this bound test, public debt would rise to 43 percent by 2016.
If key variables, including real GDP growth and primary surplus, remain at the historical 10 year average (15
percent and 5 percent of GDP, respectively), public debt would continue to rapidly decline relative to the
baseline scenario. However, prospects for oil production and oil prices are expected to have a substantial
impact on oil fund revenue going forward, so the likelihood of such scenario is low at this stage.

ANNEX IV. STATISTICAL ISSUES
1.

Economic and financial statistics

provided to the Fund are broadly adequate for
surveillance purposes. Although the authorities
have made significant progress in improving
the quality and timeliness of their
macroeconomic statistics, a number of
weaknesses should be addressed, particularly
in the areas of national accounts, price
statistics, and external sector statistics. STA has
provided extensive technical assistance and
recommendations in these areas.
2.

Azerbaijan has participated in the

GDDS since mid-2001. In April 2002, a data
ROSC mission reviewed Azerbaijan’s data
dissemination practices against GDDS
guidelines and conducted an assessment of
the quality of national accounts, consumer
price index (CPI), producer price index (PPI),
government finance, monetary, and balance of
payments statistics. The data module of the
ROSC is available on the IMF’s external
website. Azerbaijan nominated a national
SDDS Coordinator in August 2005. An SDDS
assessment mission in April 2007 provided
technical assistance on the outstanding issues
required for SDDS subscription. A data ROSC
module to reassess the Consumer Price Index
(CPI) completed in July 2008.

A. Real Sector
National accounts and price statistics
3.

Under STA’s national accounts project,

significant technical assistance has been
provided to the State Statistics Committee
(SSC) and progress has been made in a
number of areas. Methods for compiling gross
national income have been improved and
revised estimates disseminated; quarterly
national account estimates at constant prices
for 1998–2004 have been compiled; capital
investment data have been revised; estimates
of undeclared wages have been made; and a
new methodology for calculating price indices
for the construction and transportation sectors
is well underway. The March-April 2005
mission identified the following problems: (i)
the Oil Fund’s transactions are not adequately
reflected in the national accounts due to lack
of information from the Oil Fund; (ii) the SSC
does not have sufficient information to make
reliable estimates of remittances from
domestic residents working abroad; and (iii)
there are no estimates of informal sector
activity.
4.

In January 2005, the CPI was

revamped—the consumption basket was
expanded to cover 585 items and expenditure
weights updated to reflect recent consumption
patterns. With respect to regional coverage,
which is now expanded to 54 regions, the SSC
used population-based weights in the

It is important for the SSC to measure

both the asset and rental prices of housing.
Accordingly, the 2008 CPI reassessment
mission suggested compiling a house price
index, which would provide an estimate of
inflation for the capital formation component
of household final expenditure. The SSC has
been considering proposing such an index for
its statistical development program, as a new
price indicator distinct from its consumptionbased CPI.

B. Fiscal Sector

are expected to improve the compilation of

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
January 18, 2012

International Monetary Fund
700 19th Street, NW
Washington, D. C. 20431 USA

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2011 Article IV Consultation with
Azerbaijan
On January 9, 2012, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded
the Article IV consultation with Azerbaijan on a lapse of time basis. Under the IMF’s lapse of
time procedures, the Executive Board completes Article IV consultations without convening
formal discussions. 1
Background
Non-oil economic growth continues to be strong; it could reach 9 percent in 2011, up from 7½
percent in 2010, largely supported by oil-financed government spending. Though output
shortfall from new wells and maintenance issues will result in a sharply reduced oil output for
2011, the external position is projected to remain strong. Inflation fell to 6.8 percent in October
after surging early this year, because of global food price developments, but could rise with
planned public spending and non-hydrocarbon output beginning to exceed potential. The manat
exchange rate has appreciated by less than 2 percent against the U.S. dollar since November
2010.
Strong fiscal stimulus continued in 2011 triggered by unanticipated increases in global oil prices.
With the substantial increase in capital spending, staff projects the non-hydrocarbon fiscal

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On
return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the
Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the
Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the
country's authorities. An explanation of any qualifiers used in summings up can be found here:

2
deficit could increase to 44 percent of non-hydrocarbon GDP in 2011, from 38 percent in 2010,
and could exceed 50 percent if the 2012 draft budget is fully implemented.
In 2011 there was some unwinding of supportive monetary and financial sector policies adopted
in response to the 2009 global crisis. Policy rates and reserve requirement were raised
modestly, as recovery took hold and signs of spillovers from rising global food prices emerged
on domestic inflation. Market interest rates, however, have been unresponsive and credit
growth has remained sluggish. Support provided by the Central Bank to state enterprises has
continued, albeit at a slower pace, and there has been little progress with the privatization of the
systemic public bank.
Near and medium–term economic prospects are favorable and non-hydrocarbon growth could
reach 6 percent in 2012 and remain in the 5–5½ percent range thereafter, if underpinned by
medium–term fiscal consolidation and supported by non-oil Foreign Direct Investment. This
outlook assumes a substantive adjustment in the non-hydrocarbon fiscal position beginning in
2012 and progress with structural reforms, including on business environment and governance
to foster private non-hydrocarbon investment. Risks emanate mainly from a fall in oil prices
given Azerbaijan’s low reliance on non-oil exports and remittances. But large foreign assets
could provide sufficient buffer to mitigate the impact of future shocks, including a sharp and
sustained decline in oil prices.
Executive Board Assessment
In concluding the 2011 Article IV consultation with Azerbaijan, Executive Directors endorsed
staff’s appraisal, as follows:
Until recently, Azerbaijan’s strong economic performance has benefited from prudent economic
policies. Since the early 2000s, government policies have contributed to keeping nonhydrocarbon growth high and the macroeconomic environment relatively stable. The policy of
transparently saving a sizable portion of oil revenues has enabled the economy to avoid the
adverse consequences of harvesting natural resources. In addition, non-hydrocarbon growth
and well-targeted social assistance have contributed to significant reduction in poverty and
inequality.
Nevertheless, significant actions would be needed for Azerbaijan to maintain the record of high
growth and significant poverty reduction. Given the limited horizon of hydrocarbon resources,
the economy needs to be reoriented from its symbiotic dependence on natural resource
revenues. An important prerequisite for a successful transition to economic diversification and
private sector–led growth is to improve governance and the business environment. The
authorities’ recent steps in this regard are welcome, but the anticorruption campaign needs to
be extended widely and pursued resolutely. To improve the business climate, trade barriers
should be eased and regulations made less restrictive with a view to enhancing competition.

3
Fiscal policy should be delinked from the global oil price cycle. Supplemental public spending,
driven by changes in hydrocarbon prices, has exposed the economy to volatility and posed risks
to macroeconomic stability. With the non-hydrocarbon economy recovering strongly and
government spending likely to result in demand pressures in 2012, the non-hydrocarbon deficit
should be lowered. The intra-year execution of government spending should be made less
uncertain and more even.
Finite hydrocarbon resources underscore the need to achieve medium–term fiscal sustainability.
The authorities understand the need to undertake medium–term fiscal consolidation, but nearterm demands on public resources, especially for infrastructure and other large-project
spending, have, to date, trumped longer– term considerations. The non-hydrocarbon fiscal
stance in 2011 has worsened fiscal sustainability, and the 2012 draft budget could exacerbate it
further. Fiscal consolidation should commence now, and there is considerable scope for
trimming capital expenditures and boosting non-hydrocarbon revenues over the medium term.
To build public support for the consolidation effort, the authorities could employ indicative
annual targets on the non-hydrocarbon fiscal deficit. They should also strengthen the process
underlying the selection and appraisal of public investment projects.
A tightening of monetary policy, through allowing greater exchange rate flexibility, may also be
needed if demand pressures emerge. The de facto stabilized exchange rate has limited the
effectiveness of monetary policy. Allowing greater exchange rate flexibility by employing a
sufficiently wide exchange rate band would help contain inflation, and should be supplemented
with other monetary policy tools, such as interest rates. However, staff does support the
authorities’ view that the exchange rate should not be used to absorb the shocks from an
uneven and uncertain pattern of public spending. The monetary policy framework needs to be
strengthened to better counter inflation over the medium term, and in addition to helping
develop the associated infrastructure (e.g. debt markets), the central bank should improve the
communication of monetary and exchange rate policies with the public.
Addressing financial sector weaknesses is key for supporting sustainable and inclusive growth.
Effectively dealing with IBA would help maintain financial stability, contribute to transforming the
financial sector by unlocking its resources and improving efficiency. To level the playing field
and enhance competition, IBA should be downsized, and smaller banks encouraged to
consolidate into competitive entities. Steps should also be taken to enhance SME access to
finance. To minimize conflict of interest, the central bank should unwind the support it has been
providing to state enterprises (through commercial banks), and limit its role to lender of last
resort for financial institutions.
It is expected that the next Article IV consultation with Azerbaijan will be held on the standard
12–month cycle.
