STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2014 ARTICLE IV CONSULTATION
June 6, 2014

KEY ISSUES
Context: Attempts to boost activity with policy stimulus, in lieu of much-needed
structural reform, have failed to raise growth and contributed to large external
imbalances. Adverse developments in the region further cloud the outlook. High
financing needs and low buffers leave Belarus highly dependent on external financial
support. The risk of disorderly adjustment remains high.
Challenges: Mitigating immediate risks and facilitating external adjustment through a
sharp change in macroeconomic policies. Advancing the transition to a market-based
economy to raise sustainable growth.
Policy recommendations:




Halt wage increases and reduce subsidized lending to slow demand growth;
Reduce foreign exchange interventions and tighten monetary policy to facilitate
external adjustment;
Enhance market orientation of the economy through a rapid phase-out of price
controls and mandatory targets and by privatization of state-owned enterprises.

CONTEXT
1.
After two crises in four years, growth has slowed amid bouts of external pressures.
Following average annual GDP growth of 8 percent during 1997–2008, in the aftermath of the
2008 and 2011 crises growth reached only 1.7 percent in 2012 and 0.9 percent in 2013 reflecting
structural limitations of the economy and a weak external environment (Figure 1, Table 1). Repeated
attempts by the authorities to boost activity through domestic policy stimulus, while delaying
much-needed structural reform, have resulted in rapidly rising external imbalances and recurrent
bouts of exchange rate pressures, which have in turn given rise to frequent, though modest, policy
shifts in short-term efforts to maintain stability.

As short-term risks increased, policies became more cautious from the second half of
2013. After the summer, when the scale of the current account deterioration became gradually
apparent and the demand for dollar deposits rose sharply, the authorities made several policy

changes. Specifically, wage increases were paused and the exchange rate was allowed to depreciate
somewhat faster. Also, monetary policy was temporarily tightened during July–November, until the
NBRB switched to direct control of credit volumes in the last quarter of the year. The latter caused a
sharp squeeze in commercial credit, as directed lending continued unabated. The combined
measures managed to stem deposit conversions and helped quell exchange market pressure, but
they were insufficient to reduce inflation, which has persisted at around 16½ percent (Figure 3).

5.
Developments in early 2014 were mixed and affected by seasonal factors. The trade
balance improved markedly, reaching a small surplus, mainly on a sharp decline in imports. While
this improvement appears to large extent a seasonal phenomenon—the trade balance tends to
improve sharply in the first quarter to then gradually deteriorate during the year—the turnaround
may have been particularly pronounced owing to tight external financing conditions in early 2014.
Meanwhile, first quarter growth surprised on the upside (+0.5 percent y-o-y), but this was influenced
by a large investment project and unlikely to be sustainable. Policies were on hold in early 2014,
with the notable exception of monetary policy which is gradually being loosened. The authorities
continue to pursue GDP growth (3.3 percent) and real income (3 percent) targets in 2014, but in
contrast to previous years, emphasis on these objectives in policy statements has been muted.

OUTLOOK AND RISKS
6.
The outlook is for continued slow growth and persistent external imbalances. With very
weak Russian growth weighing on external demand and with domestic demand slowing, only
0.9 percent GDP growth is expected this year. Thereafter, activity remains constrained by structural
deficiencies and structurally reduced growth prospects in Russia, which prompt a downward revision
of Belarus’ medium-term growth to about 2¾ percent. Inflation is forecast to remain around
16 percent on rubel depreciation and high inflation expectations. The current account deficit is
projected at 8¾ percent of GDP in 2014 on weak external demand, low competitiveness, and a
policy mix that continues to be too loose. Going forward, limited financing and increasingly low
reserves do not permit such high deficits. Therefore, the staff’s stylized baseline scenario assumes
gradual exchange rate depreciation that brings about sufficient current account improvement to
prevent full depletion of reserves, but not enough to address imbalances and rebuild buffers. Hence,
the baseline scenario implies continued very high vulnerabilities throughout the forecast period.
Without the stylized assumptions of the baseline, vulnerabilities and the risk of a disorderly
adjustment are even higher.
7.
Risks are high and tilted to the downside. The main risks are for further balance of
payments deterioration and external financing shortfalls. Ongoing developments in Ukraine also
pose risks—notably through their impact on Russia—as does possible protracted slow growth in
other trade partners (Box 1). Meanwhile, banking sector risks remain substantial on weak loan
portfolios and rapid FX lending growth. On the upside, higher-than-envisaged support from Russia
or other donors, or successful privatization of a large Belarusian company could alleviate short-term
financing constraints.

POLICY DISCUSSIONS
8.
Discussions focused on policies to facilitate external adjustment and mitigate risks. The
staff’s adjustment scenario illustrates that consistent implementation of sound macro policies and
structural reform—in line with staff recommendations—would allow for a steady reduction of
external imbalances, strengthening of reserve buffers, and higher medium-term growth (Figure 4,
Table 3). Specifically, improving competitiveness and cautious management of domestic demand
should prompt a sustained reversal in the current account, while positive confidence effects from
structural reform would attract higher FDI. Under these conditions, reserves could be rebuilt and
reach about 4 months of import cover by 2019. As reforms take hold, medium-term, sustainable
growth could reach close to 5 percent in an environment of single-digit inflation.

Box 1. Belarus: Possible Spillovers from Regional Geopolitical Tensions
For now there are no clear spillovers to Belarus from the geopolitical tensions surrounding Russia and Ukraine.
However, spillovers may occur through several channels (listed below in approximate order of importance).



Russian support. Belarus is highly dependent on Russian support, not only through loans but also via
heavily discounted energy prices. It is unclear if the recent changes in Russia’s relationship with Ukraine
have implications for Belarus, and if so in what direction (more, or less support).



Trade. Growth in Russia— the destination of 35 percent of Belarus’ exports—is expected to suffer as a
result of sanctions, reduced confidence, and higher interest rates. Ukraine—accounting for 12 percent of
Belarus’ exports and a positive bilateral trade balance worth US$2 billion—is also a significant trade
partner. It is, however, also a (potential) competitor, including for the transit of Russian gas to Europe,
resulting in both up and downside risks from trade linkages.



Competitiveness. The Ukrainian hryvnia and Kazakhstani tenge have depreciated sharply and other CIS
exchange rates—including the Russian ruble—may be affected thereby weakening Belarus’
competitiveness and further increasing pressures on the rubel.



Financial linkages. Subsidiaries of Russian banks account for a quarter of banking sector assets with
two Russian subs being among the five largest banks. The Russian subs rely mostly on their parents for
funding and capital and any weakening of the parent banks could have substantial spillovers to Belarus.
Also, Russia accounts for about 70 percent of foreign direct investment in Belarus and any substantial
declines in these flows could significantly affect Belarus’ balance of payments.

A. Fiscal Policy: Containing Lending Programs and Wages to Curb Demand
9.
Quasi-fiscal directed lending operations and wage policies continue to be the key
fiscal policy concerns.


Lending. The flow of new subsidized lending increased 35 percent—reaching 5½ percent of
GDP—in 2013, thereby fueling domestic demand, raising the share of subsidized credit in overall
lending, and adding to concerns about the efficiency of credit allocation. It also created
contingent fiscal liabilities as a likely large share of lending was directed at ailing sectors and
enterprises. While new lending has increasingly taken place through the Development Bank
(DB), growth of directed lending in state banks also continues to be high, validating concerns

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

7

REPUBLIC OF BELARUS

that the DB has become an additional source of
subsidized credit instead of a consolidating
institution as originally envisaged. Faced with
increasing financing constraints, for 2014 the
authorities have adopted a “Financing Plan” that
identifies and sets a binding limit on the combined
subsidized lending volumes of the DB and other
banks (though it excludes subsidized housing
lending). Staff estimates that the plan implies a flow
of new directed lending on the order of 3¾ percent
of GDP.

to upside risks to the official objective.

10.
Meanwhile, the authorities again aim to balance the headline budget in 2014. The
headline budget posted a small surplus in 2013, despite a 2 percent of GDP revenue shortfall that
was countered with ad hoc increases in regulated prices and deferral of expenditures on goods and
services and public investment. Including contingent liabilities from quasi-fiscal operations, however,
staff estimates that the budget was over 6 percent in deficit (Figure 5, Table 4). For 2014, the
authorities are aiming again at a balanced headline budget, but risks are on the downside as the
erosion of revenues from external trade is likely structural owing to tariff reductions in the context of
the Eurasian customs union and declining exports on reduced external competitiveness.

Box 2. Belarus. Wage Setting: The Role of the Government
Closer inspection of the role of targets suggests a large role for the government in setting wages.
Rapid economy-wide wage growth has been a key destabilizing factor in recent years. High wage
increases—which far outstripped productivity growth—led to overheating, fueled inflation and external
imbalances, and reduced competitiveness, and were a key contributing factor to the 2009 and
2011 crises.

Note: Productivity is computed as GDP at constant prices in billion rubles/ employment. USD wage refers to the average economy-wide monthly wage measured in USD.

High wage growth in Belarus is not spontaneous but prompted by government policy through
widely-applied wage targets.



Economy-wide wage targets in US dollars, and corresponding regional and town-level targets in
local currency, have been set by the authorities in most years and apply to the entire economy,
including the private sector (companies less than 50 percent state-owned).



Although the importance of mandatory wage targets appears to be decreasing, the targets have
been closely adhered to and are a more important driver of wages than the government’s single
pay grading system, which regulates wage-setting in budgetary organizations. Very low variation
of wages between regions and sectors confirms the strong influence of official wage targets.

Policy Discussion
11.
Staff urged a sharper reduction of subsidized lending and a halt to wage increases.
Staff welcomed the authorities’ Financing Plan, which promises to be a helpful instrument in the
control of overall directed lending volumes, and recommended that it become a recurring feature of
the authorities’ policy framework. At the same time, given the associated cyclical and structural
drawbacks, it urged the authorities to be more ambitious in scaling back directed credit and to limit
new lending to 2 percent of GDP in 2014, fully channeled via the DB. Directed lending should be
reduced further to 1 percent of GDP in 2015, with a view to a full phase out over the medium term.
Staff also recommended forgoing the wage increases embedded in the official policy plans for 2014.
Keeping wages constant in nominal terms would avoid fueling domestic demand growth and help
make up for lost competitiveness from the excessively high wage growth of recent years.
12.
If directed lending and wages are not adequately contained, fiscal balance objectives
should be more ambitious. Staff advised that the authorities run a corresponding surplus for any
new subsidized lending above the recommended 2 percent of GDP limit, to offset the expansionary
effect of such excess lending and help build fiscal buffers to cope with implied contingent liabilities.
Staff also urged the authorities to optimize fiscal savings from wages and reductions in subsidies,
instead of balancing the budget by reducing capital expenditure. Such savings would also pay for
improvements in social safety nets that should accompany reform.
13.
The authorities argued that policies were already tightening and that scope for more
ambitious cutbacks was limited. They suggested that given wage hikes in recent years, which had
resulted in a large increase in average wage levels, the emphasis on meeting wage targets would be
less pronounced this year. In addition, financing constraints would limit the scope for directed
lending. In this context, the authorities explained that the Financing Plan was a temporary
instrument aimed at ensuring sufficient financing for ongoing projects deemed critical, at the
expense of lower-priority and new projects. Meanwhile, the authorities were planning to make the
DB the main coordinator of all directed lending from 2015—an initiative that was welcomed by staff
in principle although its modalities remain largely unclear. Regarding the headline fiscal balance, the
authorities worried that achieving even the zero balance mandated by the budget would prove to
be an uphill struggle if revenue performance continued to be weak. Further cuts in capital
expenditure would be considered, but there was a considerable chance that a deficit would result.

B. Monetary Policy: Reducing External Imbalances and Inflation
14.
Despite high risks to stability, the NBRB is relaxing monetary policy. Monetary policy
effectiveness remains constrained by a suboptimal operational framework and the disruptive impact
of subsidized lending. However, domestic interest rates have a direct impact on the population’s
willingness to hold local currency. Therefore, in response to the pickup in demand for foreign
currency deposits last summer, the NBRB increased the reserve requirement for foreign exchange
deposits and raised the overnight credit rate by 10 percentage points to 45 percent (Figure 6, Tables
5 and 6). From November, however, the NBRB has started to loosen policy again by reversing the

15.
Slow exchange rate adjustment compounds imbalances and poses risks. Over the past
year, the NBRB has tightened control over the exchange rate through interventions, with the regime
increasingly resembling a crawling peg (prompting a reclassification by the staff of the de facto
regime to “crawl-like arrangement”). Although the pace

Macroeconomic Balance (MB) approach is best suited for an
assessment of Belarus’ external stability, but needs to take into account the unsustainable nature of the
current external imbalance, which reduces the accuracy and relevance of any projected medium-term
current account balance. Given these challenges, the staff’s exchange rate assessment is mainly based
on the MB approach using the projected 2014 current account balance (rather than the medium-term
balance forecast) as a proxy for the underlying balance.



The MB approach estimates a further
widened gap between the projected
medium-term current account and the
estimated norm to around -7 percent. This is
consistent with a significant overvaluation.

These estimates should be interpreted carefully. The high degree of state control in the Belarus
economy and related administrative interference with price formation significantly weaken the role of
price signals relative to a market based economy. This introduces considerable uncertainty in the
estimated effectiveness of exchange rate adjustment.

Policy Discussion
16.
Staff urged further reducing exchange rate intervention, thus allowing faster
depreciation, accompanied by monetary policy tightening. Faster rubel depreciation would aid
external adjustment, save reserves, and improve competitiveness. To contain inflationary pressures
and guard against potential exchange rate overshooting, monetary policy should be simultaneously

12

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

REPUBLIC OF BELARUS

tightened. Increased exchange rate flexibility should be accompanied by a carefully crafted
communication strategy to guide expectations of market participants and the public.
17.
Staff also encouraged enhancing monetary policy effectiveness through a base money
anchor. With Belarus not ready for a successful move to inflation targeting, staff urged the NBRB to
start implementing base money targeting as a temporary policy anchor, in line with TA advice.
18.
While agreeing on the need for exchange rate flexibility, the authorities were reluctant
to increase the pace of depreciation. They remained deeply concerned about potential market
reactions, arguing that the expectations of the general public are still shaped by the experience of
the 2011 crisis and that faster depreciation could trigger a disorderly adjustment of the rubel. They
also pointed to the high economic costs of the 2011 devaluation. The authorities expected that the
arrival of the promised Russian loans would help support the balance of payments.
19.
The NBRB planned to continue loosening monetary policy to alleviate credit
constraints. The authorities argued that private enterprises had lived with high rubel interest rates
for too long and that this was stifling investment. Lowering rates was therefore the key policy
priority. They did not perceive such policy loosening as inconsistent with the challenge of reducing
high inflation. While the NBRB agreed it was highly likely that inflation would remain well above the
official 11 percent target this year, it argued this was mostly due to the impact of exchange rate
depreciation and administrative price increases. Also, the NBRB planned to continue rationing credit
volumes to avoid lower rates from resulting in a rapid acceleration of credit growth. The authorities
were studying the recommendations to re-anchor monetary policy on base money.

C. Banking Sector: Safeguarding Stability and Curbing Dollarization
20.
Rising risks in the banking sector require close attention. Prolonged weak economic
performance and adverse external developments have increased financial stability risks (Box 4). NPLs
at several key banks have increased rapidly in early 2014, even though system-wide NPLs remained
stable on account of transfers of problem loans to the Development Bank, which is not included in
the statistics and where NPLs have jumped to 7½ percent from very low levels earlier. Also,
continued liquidity problems at a large bank, which started last summer, have resulted in an
effectively open-ended extension of its exemption from regular

REPUBLIC OF BELARUS

Box 4. Belarus: Potential Impact of Exchange Rate Depreciation
High financial dollarization makes the Belarusian economy and in particular the financial sector
vulnerable to sharp exchange rate depreciation.
Direct effects from depreciation for the banking sector appear limited, even positive. Banks
maintain a long position in foreign exchange (FX), with the net open position amounting to
12 percent of capital. Recent NBRB stress tests estimate that 20 percent depreciation would initially
decrease capital ratios by 1.1 percentage point (regulatory capital is held in local currency) but
increase profits.
However, high FX-related credit risk could have a large negative indirect impact on banks. FX
loans account for a high share of corporate sector borrowing—with shares ranging from about one
quarter in the agricultural sector to more than three quarters in manufacturing—likely including a
significant number of borrowers without FX earnings (in some mainly domestically oriented sectors
more than half of loans are in FX). NBRB estimates of 20 percent depreciation show strong increases in
NPLs, significant losses in the banking sector and suggest that capital ratios of the system could fall
close to the regulatory minimum (10 percent).
While the quantitative effects of a depreciation are uncertain, information about FX exposures
indicates different impacts across sectors.



For the household sector the impact would be positive as these hold a large share of FX deposits,
while FX loans to households are banned.



For the corporate sector the impact would be
mainly negative. Overall, the corporate sector
has a negative FX position, with a large
amount of FX loans and relatively small FX
deposits. Exporters, however, may be able to
profit from depreciation.

25
20

(Percent of GDP)



14

The effect on the financial sector, on balance,
would be negative, mainly because of its large
FX exposure to corporates and through a
negative position with non-residents in the
form of largely short-term loans.

The government would be impacted through its foreign exchange denominated debt. Assuming a
20 percent depreciation, government and government-guaranteed debt would increase to
43 percent of GDP (from 37 percent at present). An increasing interest bill, and higher outlays for
bank recapitalizations, would likely compound effects over time.

1/ Official statistics do not adequately reflect risks because of pervasive evergreening and reporting weaknesses.
Indicators do not include DB as it is a non-bank financial institution.
2/ CARs fell in 2013 mostly on account of an increase in risk weights for FX loans that was introduced in October.
3/ NPLs fell in 2013 mostly because of transfers of problem loans to the DB (which is not included in the statistics).
4/ Watch loans include loans with delinquencies, negative information on the borrower or insufficient collateral.

21.
A joint World Bank-IMF mission urged reduction of state control in the banking
system. The mission assessed state lending, the DB, capital markets, and insurance, among other
areas of the financial system. It stressed the developmental challenges from pervasive state
influence in the financial system and cautioned against rapid growth of the DB (Box 5).

Policy Discussion
22.
Staff urged close supervision of banks and adequate remedial measures. The NBRB
should closely monitor the health of individual banks and decisively address any uncovered
problems. In particular, it should ensure that all banks in the system comply with capital adequacy
norms and reserve requirements. In addition, recent successes notwithstanding, the NBRB needs to
continue to closely monitor FX lending and take further measures—e.g., further raising reserve
requirements for FX loans or provisioning requirements for FX loans to unhedged borrowers—if FX
loan growth rates do not continue to decrease. In this context, staff also emphasized that loan
dollarization is closely tied to distortions from directed lending policies and the exchange rate
regime that need to be addressed. Staff seconded the findings of the recent joint mission with the
World Bank and urged the authorities to step up efforts to reduce state control of banks and
lending to promote better resource allocation and risk management. It cautioned against further
growth of the DB and called on the authorities to reverse the recent decision to make its debt
eligible for refinancing at the NBRB, which raised the specter of monetary financing of DB lending.
23.
The NBRB concurred that the situation in the banking sector bears close watching.
Specifically, it indicated it was planning to agree on a plan for restoring liquidity at the
aforementioned large bank by end May. The NBRB also shared staff’s concerns about remaining FX
lending growth and had recently further restricted the issuance of FX loans further by permitting
them only for settling transactions with non-residents. Further measures, including increased
provisioning, would be considered if the share of FX loans in total credit continued to rise.

Box 5. Belarus: Key Recommendations from Joint World Bank-IMF Mission
A recent joint World Bank-IMF financial sector mission found that the main feature of the financial
system remains the government’s pervasive influence at various levels including through (i) direct
ownership of large market players in all segments; (ii) directed and subsidized lending programs and their
distortive impact on capital allocation; and (iii) undermining institutions governing the development of
the market (e.g. lack of competition framework, oversight).
The mission made recommendations in a wide range of areas, including the following:
Directed and subsidized lending





Develop a detailed and time-bound plan for curtailing directed lending programs.
Introduce formal mechanisms for monitoring and evaluating the effectiveness of directed lending
programs.
Consolidate existing and future directed lending programs through the Development Bank.

Development Bank






Introduce external regulation and supervision of the Development Bank.
Prevent the Development Bank being used as an off-budget financing mechanism by ensuring that
it operates within the resource envelope for state programs, counting its debt towards the debt
ceiling, and reflecting the state’s contingent liabilities in the budget.
As a transitional institution the DB should not have an indefinite lifespan and as the commercial
financial sector develops, the need for a state-run Development Bank should be reconsidered.

Capital market development





Adopt a framework law establishing operational independence of the securities supervisor.
Migrate the supervisory framework from a compliance-based to risk-based supervision of
professional market participants.
Analyze in coordination with NBRB the need to implement rules governing the issuance of
corporate bonds in FX by unhedged issuers.

D. Structural Reform: Raising Sustainable Growth
24.
Some progress has been made on price
liberalization, but in other areas the stalemate continues.
Deep reform of the uncompetitive Belarus economy remains
critical. Motivated by the requirements of the Customs Union
with Russia and Kazakhstan, some progress was recently made
in reducing the number of “socially important goods” subject
to continuous price controls, though their share in the CPI
basket was modest. In other areas there has been no apparent
progress. In particular, despite increases in utility and transport
tariffs, these remain far below cost recovery levels. Also,

Policy Discussion
25.
Staff acknowledged steps in price liberalization, but emphasized the need for
comprehensive and much more ambitious reforms. Staff urged leveraging the recent progress on
price controls by stepping up efforts in other reform areas to improve resource allocation. Specific
steps would include the initiation of a time-bound plan to reach full cost recovery of utility and
transport tariffs, a detailed plan to reduce the role of the state in the economy, including a rapid
phase out of mandatory targets (for output, exports, wages, employment, and other variables) for
enterprises and credible plans for privatization. Staff also urged strengthening safety nets to cushion
the impact of reforms on the most vulnerable.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

REPUBLIC OF BELARUS

26.
The authorities recognize structural challenges but prefer strengthening the existing
system. The authorities agreed that the current economic model was not producing favorable
outcomes, and that falling competitiveness was posing a structural challenge. They argued that the
challenge could be met through strengthened management and appropriate reform within the
existing system. In this context, they pointed out that even though mandatory targets for enterprises
continued to cover a wide range of variables, in practice emphasis was increasingly placed on
targets for labor productivity, profitabiliy, and exports, while compliance with other targets was
becoming less critical. The authorities also pointed to their recent privatization efforts, but indicated
that market conditions had not been conducive.

CAPACITY TO REPAY AND FUND RELATIONS
27.
Capacity to repay remains strained and subject to high risks. Belarus met its external
obligations in 2013, but payment capacity will continue to be tested in 2014 given continued large
debt repayments, a weak balance of payments position,

The authorities are confident that bilateral
loans will allow them to meet financing needs this
year. Nonetheless, they continue to seek sources of
additional financing. In this context, the Ministry of
Finance expected to be able to issue US$700 million in
FX-denominated domestic bonds this year
(US$200 million of which had already been issued). At
the same time, they conceded that realizing the official
plan to issue a US$800 million Eurobond would prove a
challenge given market conditions and unresolved
technical problems. The authorities also noted that if
they did not meet ACF conditionality, they would not
receive the last remaining $440 million ACF tranche.
They were more hopeful, however, regarding the
prospects for significant privatizations, which they
thought could bring substantial foreign exchange
revenues.

STAFF APPRAISAL
29.
Large imbalances and low buffers call for decisive policy change. Expansionary policies,
slowing trade-partner growth, and an insufficiently flexible exchange rate have undermined
competitiveness and led to increasing external imbalances. Meanwhile, growth has remained low
and inflation high. External financing needs are large while market access remains limited and
reserves have fallen to a low level. Adverse developments in the region compound the already high
risks. The authorities have started to tentatively change policies, but much stronger actions are
needed to mitigate risks of disorderly external adjustment.
30.
Directed lending should be reduced much faster than currently envisaged. The
reduction of the volume of net new directed lending under the authorities’ Financing Plan is a
welcome step, but the authorities should be more ambitious in limiting net new lending. This would
help reduce domestic demand, generate budget savings, and contain contingent liabilities
associated with lending to unviable projects and enterprises.
31.
Wages should not rise any further in 2014. It will be critical to forgo the wage increases
embedded in official policy plans to avoid fueling domestic demand growth and to regain lost
competitiveness from the excessively high wage growth of recent years.
32.
If directed lending and wages are not contained, fiscal objectives should be more
ambitious. The authorities should run a corresponding budget surplus in 2014 for any new
subsidized lending above the recommended 2 percent of GDP limit, so as to offset the expansionary
effect of the excess lending and help build fiscal buffers to cope with implied contingent liabilities.
Fiscal adjustment should be achieved by optimizing fiscal savings from wages and reductions in
subsidies, instead of further reducing capital expenditure.
33.
FX interventions should be further reduced and monetary policy tightened. Stepped up
rubel depreciation—in a controlled manner—is needed to improve competitiveness, aid external
adjustment, and save reserves. To contain inflationary pressures and limit potential for exchange
rate overshooting, monetary policy should be simultaneously tightened. The effectiveness of
monetary policy could be enhanced by moving to a base money anchor, in the context of a flexible
exchange rate. Approval of remaining exchange restrictions and multiple currency practices, which
the authorities are in the process of eliminating, is not recommended by staff.
34.
Rising risks in the banking sector require close attention and action. Recent increases in
NPLs and ongoing liquidity problems in a major bank call for very close supervision and adequate
remedial measures. The NBRB should ensure that all banks in the system comply with capital
adequacy norms and reserve requirements. While recently on a downward trend, FX lending growth
also continues to bear close watching and the NBRB should consider taking additional measures—
such as a further increase in reserve requirements for FX loans—if loan growth does not continue to
come down.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

19

REPUBLIC OF BELARUS

35.
Efforts to reduce the role of the state in the banking sector should be intensified. The
mission welcomes the intention to increasingly free up commercial banks from lending under
government programs by making the Development Bank (DB) the coordinator of all such lending
from 2015. However, this step should be complemented with a detailed and time-bound plan for
rapidly phasing out subsidized lending and developing a banking sector that works on a fully
commercial basis. Debt of the DB should not be eligible for refinancing at the NBRB, so as to avoid
monetary financing of its lending.
36.
Broad structural reforms are needed to boost sustainable growth. Progress on price
controls should be leveraged by stepping up efforts in other reform areas to improve resource
allocation. Such efforts should include initiation of a time-bound plan to reach full cost recovery of
utility and transport tariffs, a detailed plan to reduce the role of the state in the economy, and a
strengthening of social safety nets. While the full benefits of such reforms accrue over time, bold
upfront actions would help raise policy credibility and boost confidence even in the short run.

Appendix I. Belarus: Implementation of Past IMF Policy Recommendations
Belarus has a mixed record of implementing Fund policy advice and the recommendations from the
previous Article IV Consultation were heeded only to limited extent.
Overview. During the 2009–10 Stand-By Arrangement, progress was made on macroeconomic
policies and in a few structural reform areas, but many of the gains were reversed after the program
ended, contributing to a severe currency crisis in 2011. Since the crisis, the authorities have
selectively implemented Fund recommendations, but often in an inconsistent manner and only
temporarily, when forced by mounting external pressures.
2013 Article IV Consultation. Since the previous consultation, the authorities allowed wage growth
to slow but it continued to exceed targeted inflation—which staff had suggested as an upper limit—
by a wide margin. Similarly, monetary policy was tightened in the summer of 2013, as recommended
by staff, but progressively loosened later while inflation remained high. Moreover, the flow of
directed lending increased and amounted to more than double the volume advised by staff in 2013.
Also, in contrast to staff recommendation to maintain a flexible exchange rate, NBRB control over
the rubel was tightened. In the financial sector, successful measures were taken to curb FX lending
growth, as urged by staff, although considerable risks remain. Advice on the Development Bank was
mostly not followed and the bank is becoming an additional source of macroeconomic and financial
risks. On the structural front, the authorities proceeded to abolish some price controls in line with
staff advice. However, no progress was made on privatization and state-owned enterprise
restructuring or with the strengthening of safety nets.

Likelihood

Protracted period of slower growth in
advanced and emerging economies.
Sovereign stress re-emerges in the Euro
Area due to incomplete reforms,
unanticipated outcomes from the asset
quality review and stress tests in the absence
of a fiscal backstop.
Sharp increase in geopolitical tensions
surrounding Russia/Ukraine that creates
significant disruptions in global financial,

Medium

Impact if realized
High/Medium
Slower growth in advanced and
emerging economies (especially
Russia) would produce negative
spillovers through trade and
remittances causing further current
account deterioration and raising
external financing needs.
High
Slower growth in Russia, reduced
confidence, and higher interest rates
would produce negative spillovers.
Tensions could also affect support
from Russia (in negative or positive
ways).

Policy Response

 Increase exchange rate

flexibility and tighten
monetary policy.
 Tighten macroeconomic
policies to narrow external
imbalances.
 Speed up structural reforms
to increase competitiveness.

In case of upside shock:
 Build reserves.

Medium
A negative shock would lower energy
import prices, but also reduce exports
because of likely lower growth in
Russia.
Medium
Stimulus efforts would boost demand
and reignite inflation and fuel
pressures on the exchange rate.

 Tighten macroeconomic

Potential state-owned bank
recapitalization costs could be

 Intensify supervision and

including through more
frequent onsite monitoring.
 Reduce new subsidized and
directed lending.

The Risk Assessment Matrix (RAM) shows events that could materially alter the baseline path (the scenario most
likely to materialize in the view of IMF staff). The relative likelihood of risks listed is the staff’s subjective assessment
of the risks surrounding the baseline (“low” is meant to indicate a probability below 10 percent, “medium” a
probability between 10 and 30 percent, and “high” a probability of 30 percent or more). The RAM reflects staff views
on the source of risks and overall level of concern as of the time of discussions with the authorities. Non-mutually
exclusive risks may interact and materialize jointly.

REPUBLIC OF BELARUS

Appendix IV. Belarus: Public Debt Sustainability Analysis (Continued)
Public sector debt dynamics in Belarus appear benign in the baseline but fail to capture large
contingent liabilities associated with subsidized lending and guarantees. Belarus has also become
more vulnerable to exchange rate shocks because of rising debt dollarization. Stress tests indicate
that contingent liabilities and exchange rate risks have a major impact on fiscal sustainability.
Stress test assumptions and impact
Belarus-Specific Stress Tests


Exchange rate shock. The scenario assumes 30 percent devaluation in the real exchange
rate in 2015. The debt ratio increases to over 37 percent of GDP by 2019, up 8 percent of
GDP from the baseline. Meanwhile, gross financing needs rise to 19 percent of GDP in
2019.



Contingent liability shock. The shock assumes that half of the stock of outstanding
directed and subsidized loans would not be repaid, leading to a one-off fiscal cost of
10 percent of GDP. The shock results in a sharp increase in the debt ratio to 43 percent of
GDP by 2019. Meanwhile, gross financing needs would rise to 19 percent of GDP in 2015,
and stay high over the medium-term.

Standard stress tests


Growth shock. Under this scenario, real output growth rates are lowered during 2015–16.
The public debt ratio increases 8 percentage points by 2019, while the gross financing
needs ratio in 2019 increases over 3 percent relative to the baseline.



Interest rate shock. This scenario examines the implications for debt sustainability of an
increase in spreads by 500 basis points. The deterioration in the ratios for debt and gross
financing need are back-loaded as old debt gradually matures and new higher interest
rate debt is contracted. However, by 2019, the impact on financing needs is significant.



Primary balance shock. This scenario assumes a revenue shock and a rise in interest
rates leading to a cumulative 1.4 percentage points of GDP deterioration in the primary
balance. The combined shocks lead to deterioration in the debt ratio and gross financing
needs, but the impact is more muted than in other scenarios under consideration.



Combined macro shock. This scenario comprises a recession in 2015–16, a 500 basis
point increase in interest rates, and a sharp rise in expenditures. It pushes the debt to GDP
ratio up towards 50 percent of GDP, and significantly increases gross financing needs.

Safeguards Assessments:
Voluntary (non-program related) assessment of the NBRB was completed in April 2004. The
assessment concluded that significant vulnerabilities existed in the safeguards framework, especially
in the areas of the legal structure and independence, external and internal audit, and in financial
reporting. The assessment made specific recommendations to correct the identified shortcomings.
An updated assessment of the NBRB, which was completed in May 2009 in connection with the
Stand-By Arrangement approved on January 12, 2009, found little progress in addressing previously
2

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

REPUBLIC OF BELARUS

identified vulnerabilities. The assessment determined that risks have increased since the
voluntary 2004 assessment and recommended the following measures:


Adopting a new law that provides operational and financial independence for the NBRB to
ensure the effectiveness of the NBRB’s internal and external audit mechanisms and the control
systems,



Conducting special audits of NIR and NDA data to reduce the risk of misreporting,



Divesting the NBRB’s investment in non-financial subsidiaries, and



Publishing the audited IFRS financial statements.

The NBRB implemented only some of the recommendations. Special audits of NIR and NDA data for
March, June, September and December 2009 test dates were completed. The NBRB divested most of
its non-financial subsidiaries in 2011, but also increased involvement in quasi-fiscal activities, e.g., in
the first half of 2011 the NBRB purchased bonds issued by domestic banks at higher than market
prices and subsequently sold them to the Development Bank to acquire bonds issued by the latter.
While the new Banking Law provides some improvement over its previous version, NBRB autonomy
is still undermined, in particular, by powers of the President to amend the NBRB Statute at any time,
to direct NBRB operations by his decrees, and to dismiss Board members.
Exchange Arrangements:
The currency of Belarus is the Belarusian rubel, which was introduced in 1994.
The de jure exchange rate regime is managed float. Starting from the last quarter of 2012, the
Belarusian rubel has followed a gradually depreciating trend with a 2 percent band. Therefore, the
de facto exchange rate arrangement has been retroactively reclassified from other managed to
crawl-like arrangement, effective September 19, 2012.
Belarus accepted the obligations of Article VIII, Sections 2, 3, and 4 of the IMF’s Articles of
Agreement on November 5, 2001.
An Article VIII mission took place in 2013 and identified exchange restrictions and multiple currency
practices (MCPs) subject to the Fund’s jurisdiction. The exchange restrictions arise from the
requirement of an NBRB permit for (i) advance payments for imports and (ii) payments for imports
with delivery outside of Belarus. The MCPs arise from (i) the potential deviation by more than two
percent of the exchange rates in the over-the-counter (OTC) market and the Belarusian Currency
and Stock Exchange (BCSE), (ii) the potential deviation by more than two percent of the exchange
rates in the OTC market and the BCSE exchange rate or the official exchange rate with respect to the
mandatory resale of unused foreign exchange by resident legal entities and foreign exchange
amounts subject to mandatory sale requirement and (iii) broken cross rates among the currencies
for which the NBRB establishes official exchange rates with monthly frequency with respect to the

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

mandatory resale of unused FX by resident legal entities and FX amounts subject to mandatory sale
requirement.
Based on the mission’s recommendations, the NBRB developed and approved a plan to eliminate all
of the restrictions in the near future. Legislative amendments to this effect are in process. At this
time, the authorities do not request Board approval of the identified exchange restrictions and
MCPs. The staff supports the authorities’ plans to eliminate the measures and encourages them to
implement these as soon as possible.
UFR/Article IV Consultation:
Belarus is on a 12-month consultation cycle. The last Article IV consultation was concluded on May
25, 2013. The report was published: http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/cat/longres.aspx?sk=40666.0.
Stand-By Arrangement:
A 15–month Stand-By Arrangement (SBA) in the amount of SDR 1.6 billion (US$2.5 billion,
418.8 percent of quota) was approved by the Executive Board (Country Report No. 09/109) on
January 12, 2009. An augmentation of the SBA was approved on June 29, 2009 in conjunction with
the completion of the first review (Country Report No. 09/260), bringing the Fund’s financial support
to SDR 2.3 billion (US$3.5 billion, 587.3 percent of quota). The final review was completed on
March 26, 2010. Total disbursements under the program amounted to SDR 2.3 billion
(US$3.5 billion).
FSAP Participation, ROSCs, and OFC Assessments:
Two FSAP missions took place in 2004 and an FSSA report was published on
http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/cat/longres.cfm?sk=18367.0.
The detailed assessment reports were disseminated in May 2006 for the Basel Core Principles for

RELATIONS WITH THE WORLD BANK GROUP
A. The World Bank Group Strategy
1. The World Bank Group (WBG) Country Partnership Strategy (CPS) for FY 2014–17 was
discussed by the WBG Board of Executive Directors in June 2013. The CPS supports Belarus to
improve: 1) competitiveness of the economy by supporting structural reforms, including reducing
the role of the state, transforming the state-owned enterprise (SOE) sector, promoting private and
financial sector development and integration into the global economy; (2) quality and efficiency of
public infrastructure services, use of agricultural and forestry resources and global benefits of public
goods; and (3) human development outcomes through better education, health and social services.
The WBG program includes Analytical and Advisory Activities (AAA), investment lending by the
World Bank and investments in the private sector by the IFC.
2. WBG lending is focused on investment lending in sectors with an adequate and improving
policy framework, a sufficient knowledge base, a solid implementation track record and
demonstrated Government commitment. The CPS envisages new investment lending, totaling up
to US$ 570 Million during 2013-2015. Lending operations will support investments in private sector
development, public financial management (PFM) systems, forest management, energy efficiency,
district heating, water supply/sanitation, education, and transport.
3. The WBG also supports a program of analytical and advisory activities. Core diagnostics
around critical developmental issues will continue, including structural reforms, fiscal, PFM, trade,
WTO accession, private and financial sector development. These advisory and technical
engagements - many of them of a programmatic nature - will underpin the policy dialogue in critical
reform areas, supporting the Government in designing and implementing policies to achieve stated
objectives of economic modernization and strengthened competitiveness. Analyses in such areas as
municipal services, forestry, education and health will underpin future investment operations.
4. The WBG’s program in Belarus will be calibrated according to the depth, breath and speed
of structural reforms. Accordingly, the AAA and lending programs have been identified only for
the first two years of the CPS. Should structural reforms accelerate, lending scope and instruments
could be revisited at mid-term of the CPS period.
5. The IFC will support private sector development and energy efficiency improvements
through a combination of investments and advisory work. The IFC program in Belarus will
support: (i) trade development in critical sectors such as agriculture, with strategic focus on small
and medium-sized exporters and importers, (ii) micro, small, and medium-sized enterprises’
(MSMEs) access to finance, (iii) investments into energy efficiency improvements, and (iv) advisory
work on regulatory simplification, including in agriculture and forestry. Agriculture will remain a
6

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

REPUBLIC OF BELARUS

priority sector, with support directed at improvements in agricultural output and efficiency, access to
finance, regulatory environment, and food safety standards.

B. IMF-World Bank Group Collaboration in Specific Areas
6.
The WBG and the Fund teams will continue to work closely in delivering their assistance.
The IMF plays a key role at the macro level, while the World Bank Group focuses on the structural
reform agenda, business regulatory environment and investment climate, energy efficiency,
infrastructure and social and environmental issues. Recent examples of close cooperation and
coordination between the Bank Group and the Fund include ongoing discussions under the IMF
post program monitoring and Article IV Consultations and during the preparation of the WBG CPS,
and joint work with the Government working group on structural reforms issues.

Areas in Which the World Bank Group Leads
7.
Structural reforms and private business development. Under the CPS, the Bank will
continue to support the design and implementation of structural reforms through its programmatic
structural reform technical assistance. This programmatic TA which will be implemented through
2016 is focused on providing targeted analytical and advisory support on structural reforms,
including further liberalization of factor and product markets to support a more efficient allocation
of resources in the economy, transformation of the SOEs and enhancing private sector growth,
including the services sector. As part of this TA, the World Bank is also providing focused technical
assistance to support Belarus’ WTO accession. In addition, the WBG is implementing a privatization
TA (which was initiated during the previous CPS and is largely funded through a donor Trust Fund)
to provide advice on legal and institutional instruments and implementation capacity to successfully
launch an enterprise privatization program that is on par with international best practice. The WBG
has initiated a new private sector development TA which supports the Government in establishing
an effective system for the promotion of small and medium-sized enterprises. In addition, the IFC
will continue to deliver an active advisory program around challenges facing the private sector and
international “best practices” for improving the regulatory environment and investment climate.
8.
Public Financial Management. The WBG will continue to provide technical assistance to
improve public financial management systems in Belarus. During the previous CPS work has been
initiated on strengthening the medium-term perspective in fiscal planning, enhancing debt
management and moving towards a more result-oriented budget management system. To assess
the current state of PFM performance, the Bank has updated the Public Expenditure and Financial
Accountability (PEFA) assessment. The PEFA is a key diagnostic to underpin the preparation of the
planned PFM modernization investment loan to improve transparency and efficiency of public
financial management and strengthen accountability of the Government for the use of public funds.
9.
Energy sector. Currently, two energy efficiency projects are being implemented in Belarus
with World Bank’s financial support: Energy Efficiency Project (EEP) (US$215 million), and Biomass
District Heating Project (US$90).
10. Road Transport. The Road Upgrading and Modernization Project (US$150 million) is aimed at
developing Belarusian transport infrastructure on a strategic route, the Trans-European Transport

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

7

REPUBLIC OF BELARUS

Corridor IX, connecting the Black Sea with the Baltic countries. A new Transit Corridor Improvement
Project (US$250 million) is under preparation.
11. Environment. The Bank supports Belarus’ efforts in strengthening its environment institutions,
addressing key public health challenges, and complying with its international commitments.
Progress is being made towards achieving improved water, wastewater and solid waste
management services under the Water Supply and Sanitation Project (US$60 million) and Solid
Waste Management Project (US$42.5 million). Additional Financing Loan (US$90 million) to enhance
the impact of the Water Supply and Sanitation Project has been approved.

Areas of Shared Responsibility
12. Macroeconomic development. The two institutions discuss and consult with each other in the
preparation of macroeconomic framework and debt sustainability analysis, as well as in the
preparation of analytical pieces on macro-growth issues.
13. Public expenditure management. Building on the recently completed PER 1 and 2, the Bank
will continue to focus on improving the efficiency of public spending. The first two volumes of the
programmatic Public Expenditure Review focused on spending efficiency in agriculture, energy,
social assistance, pension sectors, intergovernmental fiscal relations, and the efficiency of public
spending in health and education. The Bank will continue to provide targeted analytical and advisory
services to support fiscal reforms within a consistent macroeconomic framework, to ensure fiscal
and debt sustainability and to provide for growth supporting expenditure and revenue policies.
Integrating recommendations of the two volumes, the Bank will deliver a synthesis report on fiscal
reforms. The Fund, jointly with the Bank, has been working on supporting the authorities in their
fiscal consolidation effort, including technical assistance on expenditure rationalization.
14. Financial sector. The Bank and the Fund will jointly support the authorities in addressing key
vulnerabilities in the financial sector and designing needed reforms. The Bank and the IMF are
collaborating in financial sector monitoring, including on key developments, such as the newly
established Development Bank. The World Bank will maintain an active dialogue with the authorities
on financial consumer protection and financial literacy and the overall development of the financial
sector, including through a joint FSAP Development Module, completed in May 2014.

Areas in which the IMF Leads
15. The IMF is actively engaged with the authorities in discussing their macroeconomic program
and policies, providing technical assistance and related support, including support on economic and
financial statistics, tax policy, monetary operations, and fiscal transparency. The IMF is leading the
dialogue on monetary and exchange rate policies, and overall fiscal policies.
16. The IMF analysis in these areas serves as an input to the Bank’s policy advice. The Bank and
the IMF teams have regular consultations, and Bank staff takes part in IMF Article IV Consultations.
This helps to ensure consistency of policy recommendations by the two institutions.

STATISTICAL ISSUES
(As of April 1, 2014)
I. Assessment of Data Adequacy for Surveillance
General:
Data provision is broadly adequate for surveillance.
National Accounts:
The National Statistical Committee of the Republic of Belarus (BelStat) compiles and disseminates
quarterly and annual GDP estimates at current and constant prices The quality of the estimates is
good, and the timeliness and periodicity exceed the Special Data Dissemination Standard (SDDS)
requirements. In addition to the quarterly and annual estimates, a monthly GDP is compiled 15 days
after the end of the reference month. The BelStat compiles annually a full set of accounts (up to the
financial accounts), institutional sector accounts, and input-output tables. Since 2008 Belstat has been
compiling regional GDP estimates. The accuracy of the source data is good, and the statistical
techniques used are sound. The national accounts estimates are internally consistent, and they are also
consistent with other macroeconomic statistics. All other real sector data are disseminated in
accordance with the SDDS requirements.
Belarus participates in the STA project for the Sustainable Compilation of Real Sector Statistics in
Eastern Europe, funded by the government of Japan, and receives technical assistance and support
from a statistics advisor resident in Moldova. BelStat has made good progress to date implementing
the concepts and methods of the 2008 SNA and to improve the compilation of the national accounts
as needed.
Price Statistics:
The CPI covers 31 towns in the country and the PPI covers approximately 1,800 industrial
organizations, and they are published monthly. The NSC also publishes indices for foodstuffs,
non-food goods, and services. CPI weights are based on expenditure data from 2012, while the PPI is
based on weights from 2011. For the most part, Belstat is producing the CPI and PPI in accordance
with international standards and best practices as noted in the CPI and PPI Manuals. They also are
in compliance with SDDS standards, including updating their metadata for the IMF Dissemination
Standards Bulletin Board on an annual basis.
Government finance statistics:
Government finance statistics are compiled in broad compliance with the recommendations of the
Government Finance Statistics Manual 2001 (GFSM 2001). Areas that need improvement include
classification of some expenses (e.g. subsidies to corporations, social benefits to households, capital
transfers to corporations); inconsistency between GFS and monetary data; valuation of assets and
liabilities (at nominal or market value); and compilation for public corporations.
Monetary statistics:
Monetary and Financial Statistics are compiled by the National Bank of the Republic of Belarus (NBRB),
broadly following the methodology of the IMF’s Monetary and Financial Statistics Manual (MFSM). The
NBRB has implemented most of STA recommendations regarding monetary statistics.

10

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

REPUBLIC OF BELARUS

External sector statistics:
The NBRB publishes quarterly balance of payments and international investment position statements
in the BPM5 format (for 1996–2011) and in the BPM6 format since 2012 (revised data available
from 2005). Overall the timeliness and serviceability of external sector data is satisfactory, although
there are gaps in external debt data, in particular gross external debt statistics.
II. Data Standards and Quality

Statement by the IMF Staff Representative on the Republic of Belarus
July 16, 2014
1.
This statement reports on key developments since the staff report was finalized.
While some of the new information implies slightly reduced risks, the need for substantial
external adjustment remains and therefore the information does not alter the thrust of the
staff appraisal.
2.
On June 26, Belarus received US$2 billion in bridge financing from Russia. The
short-term loan, issued by VTB bank, refinances the earlier US$450 million VTB bridge loan
that was disbursed in December 2013 and provides US$1.55 billion in net new financing. This
allowed reserves to rise to US$6.4 billion (1.7 months of imports) at end June. The VTB bridge
loan is expected to be replaced by a long-term loan from the Russian government in the same
amount. The disbursement of the Russian money was anticipated and is included in the
macroeconomic projections in the staff report. Therefore, the new financing—while mitigating
risks in the very short term—does not alter the staff’s overall assessment of Belarus’ external
vulnerabilities this year, which remain high.
3.
Separately, Russia also agreed to lower oil duties payable by Belarus from 2015. In
the context of the treaty on the Eurasian Economic Union (EEA) that was signed end May,
Russia agreed to lower, starting next year, the duties that Belarus pays to the Russian budget on
oil products that are produced with oil imported from Russia but exported outside of the customs
union. The duty savings associated with the new agreement amount to US$1.5 billion (2 percent
of GDP) per year, provided the agreement is renewed. While this will support the external
position, reserves will remain far below comfortable levels. Beyond the oil-duty reduction, the
short-term impact of the EEA is expected to be modest given the already high degree of trade
integration between Belarus and Russia.
4.
First-quarter growth was revised slightly upwards while the trade balance has
recently started to deteriorate. Q1-GDP growth was revised up to ¾ percent, from ½ percent in
earlier preliminary estimates. Newly available component data suggest that Q1 growth was
entirely driven by net exports, in line with the seasonal improvement in the trade balance in the
first months of the year. Incidentally, the trade balance deteriorated in April, turning into a small
deficit—a trend that is expected to continue as the year progresses. Meanwhile, the current
account deficit in the first quarter amounted to US$1.7 billion (10.4 percent of quarterly GDP) as
the improvement in trade was offset by a seasonal increase in repatriated earnings. The overall
balance of payments recorded a US$1.1 billion deficit in Q1, resulting in a corresponding reserve
loss.
5.
Inflation has accelerated, amid continued loose monetary policy. Monthly inflation
increased from 1.3 percent in March to 2.5 percent in May, causing inflation to reach 19 percent
in year-on-year terms—the highest rate since May 2013. While the NBRB, in view of the uptick
in inflation, refrained from further reducing its key “refinancing rate” in June, it reduced its
overnight deposit rate by one percentage point to 19 percent in early July.
6.
A large bank’s exemption from reserve requirements will not be removed until
March 2015. In the context of its ongoing liquidity problems, the NBRB has agreed with this

2
large bank on a recovery plan that requires the bank to fully comply with normal reserve
requirements only by end-March 2015. Until then the bank is held to an individual, gradually
increasing, reserve requirement schedule—with which the NBRB indicates it is currently fully
complying. The liquidity problems notwithstanding, in recent months the bank substantially
reduced its deposit interest rates.

IMF Executive Board Concludes Article IV Consultation with the Republic of Belarus
On July 16, 2014, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded
the Article IV consultation1 with the Republic of Belarus.
Following average annual GDP growth of 8 percent during 1997–2008, in the aftermath of
the 2008 and 2011 crises growth has slowed—reaching only 0.9 percent in 2013—reflecting
structural limitations of the economy and a weak external environment. Meanwhile, Belarus’
external position has deteriorated sharply with the current account deficit reaching 10 percent
of GDP in 2013. Inflation continues to be in double digits and the real exchange rate has
appreciated rapidly.
Following a highly expansionary policy stance earlier, wage and credit policies have become
more cautious from the second half of 2013. This helped stem immediate pressures in the
fall. Since then, policies have been mostly on hold, with the notable exception of monetary
policy, which is gradually being loosened. The first quarter of 2014 saw improvements in
GDP growth and the trade balance, but this partly reflected seasonal and one-off factors.
The outlook is for continued slow growth and persistent external imbalances, but risks are
high and tilted to the downside. With weak Russian growth weighing on external demand
and with domestic demand slowing, only 0.9 percent GDP growth is expected this year,
while inflation is forecast to remain around 16 percent. The current account deficit is
projected at 8¾ percent of GDP in 2014 on weak external demand, low competitiveness, and
a policy mix that continues to be too loose.
Executive Board Assessment2
Executive Directors noted the pressing challenges facing the Belarusian economy, including
low economic growth, high inflation, and large external imbalances. With an adverse
external environment further clouding the outlook, Directors urged the authorities to take

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with members, usually every
year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial information, and discusses with officials the country's
economic developments and policies. On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for
discussion by the Executive Board.

At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the Board, summarizes the views of Executive
Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the country's authorities. An explanation of any qualifiers used in summings

decisive policy actions to facilitate adjustment, and to deepen structural reforms to eliminate
constraints to higher and sustainable growth.
Directors welcomed the envisaged reduction of new directed and subsidized lending but saw
a need for more ambitious cuts to help contain contingent liabilities. They welcomed the
intention to let the Development Bank coordinate all directed lending starting in 2015 and
underscored the importance of a comprehensive plan for phasing out such lending over the
medium term and developing a banking sector that operates on a fully commercial basis.
Directors noted with concern the high wage growth in recent years. They emphasized the
importance of keeping wage growth aligned with productivity improvement to avoid fueling
inflation and regain competitiveness. They also recommended achieving fiscal adjustment
through savings from wages and subsidy reductions, instead of further reducing capital
expenditure.
Directors concurred on the need to scale back foreign exchange intervention to allow greater
exchange rate flexibility needed to strengthen competitiveness, thus facilitating external
adjustment and protecting reserves. At the same time, Directors agreed that monetary policy
should be tightened to contain inflation and guard against exchange rate overshooting. In this
context, moving to base money targeting would provide a policy anchor and improve the
effectiveness of monetary policy.
Directors cautioned that recent increases in nonperforming loans and ongoing problems in a
large bank require close supervision and adequate remedial measures. They highlighted the
need for the central bank to ensure that all banks comply with capital adequacy norms and
reserve requirements. The growth in foreign exchange lending should also be closely
monitored.
Directors stressed that broad and deep structural reforms are essential to boost sustainable
growth. They encouraged the authorities to build on the recent progress in price liberalization
by stepping up reforms in other areas to improve resource allocation, including utility and
transport tariff reform, reducing the role of the state in the economy, and strengthening social
safety nets.

Statement by Mr. Prader, Executive Director for the Republic of Belarus,
and Mr. Misyukovets, Advisor to the Executive Director
July 16, 2014
The Belarusian authorities appreciate the useful dialogue with the Fund staff during the
2014 Article IV Consultation. Since they broadly agree with the staff’s assessment of
macroeconomic developments and recommendations on economic and financial policies,
we will only focus on some of the recent developments and a few areas where the scope,
pace, and sequencing of policy action are of particular relevance.
Macroeconomic developments in Belarus reflect the prevailing economic trends in
the transition and emerging market countries of the region, with slow and modest
recovery in Central and Eastern Europe in the first half of 2014. As is the case for most
countries in the region, Belarus faces an array of similar, and at times, conflicting
developments. On the one hand, the near- and medium-term outlook reflects tailwinds
from the expected acceleration of demand in high income markets, although uncertainties
in this field are high due to the risk of deflation within the Eurozone. On the other hand,
stagnant demand in developing countries globally, tightening financial conditions,
declining commodity prices worldwide, and substantial price differentials for crude oil
and oil derivatives – a sizable part of Belarus’ exports – represent headwinds to growth
prospects. In addition to the developments in Russia and the situation in Ukraine, these
global trends have also had an impact on Belarus’ external position and must be taken
into account in designing a comprehensive policy response.
GDP grew by 0.9 percent in 2013 and has accelerated modestly to 1.5 percent in
January-May 2014. In January-April 2014, the current account deficit amounted to
$2.2 billion, or 71.6 percent of the deficit in the same period of 2013. The positive trade
balance of $657.8 million (3.1 percent of GDP) in January-April 2014 factors in both
goods ($43.5 million) and services ($614.3 million) and by far outperforms the trade
balance of $35.3 million (0.2 percent of GDP), with a sizable deficit of trade in goods of
$866.8 million in January-April 2013. Given that GDP in January-April 2013 jumped to
3.1 percent, Belarus’ economic performance in 2014 is noticeably more balanced and in
line with the authorities’ commitment to maintaining stability. The authorities recognize
that growth in 2014 has been driven largely by domestic demand but, in view of its
moderate pace, would argue that it has been in sync with the business cycle and that
accommodative policies have been reasonably cautious, i.e. only to help the economy
adjust and mitigate the multiple adverse effects through a combination of policy and
economic management measures.
Inflation remained high at 8.9 percent in January-May, possibly exceeding the
authorities’ target of 12 percent for 2014. Unlike in 2013 when inflation has been
fueled mostly by the need to increase regulated utility and public transport tariffs, core
inflation has accelerated in 2014 largely due to fiscal measures (increases of excise taxes)
and successive bold steps to remove the remaining price controls. In light of inflationary
pressures, the NBRB has used the available monetary instruments to slow down inflation
and maintain exchange rate stability. The refinancing rate, currently at 21.5 percent,

2
been taken continuously to discourage dollarization and to contain liquidity and credit
growth.
The rubel has depreciated by 7 percent in nominal terms since January and, if the
current pace of depreciation is maintained, the resulting weakening will be sufficient for
an orderly adjustment, provided other macroeconomic measures are applied in a
consistent manner and the terms of trade do not worsen. The authorities have taken note
of the staff’s recommendation to step up rubel depreciation in the context of other policy
measures as well as of the assessment of the impact of exchange rate depreciation. At the
same time, they are concerned that the cumulative negative implication beyond the FX
exposure and debt management, resulting from accelerated inflation, growing fiscal
constraints and decreased public confidence in the rubel, could escalate imbalances and
derail stabilization. Having said that, the authorities remain committed to further
exchange rate flexibility as the external position improves and additional buffers are built
up to cushion adverse developments.
Fiscal policy continues to be disciplined, resulting in a general government budget
surplus of 0.2 percent of GDP in 2013, with a marginal central government budget deficit
of 0.4 percent of GDP primarily due to lower revenues from potash exports. The
authorities are committed to maintaining a prudent fiscal stance to ensure a balanced
budget in 2014. In January-April 2014, the general government budget and the central
government budget showed a surplus of 2.2 percent and 1.0 percent of GDP, respectively.
Rightsizing government support is well underway with the aim to transfer all lending
under government programs to the Development Bank in 2015. The 2015 budget will
also be balanced and the approach to wages in the budgetary sector will continue to be
prudent. The Ministry of Finance, in cooperation with the World Bank, has started to
develop a strategy and an implementation plan for moving to a new approach to public
financial management aimed at increasing efficiency, devolution of responsibility, and
strengthening accountability.
Public debt remains at a sustainable level. In January-April, 2014, external public debt
declined by $424.8 million and amounted to 16.7 percent of GDP, far below the national
economic security threshold of 45 percent of GDP and the Maastricht criterion of 60
percent of GDP. In 2014, the government has paid $673 million to meet its external
obligations, including $523 million in repurchases to the Fund. On July 9, 2014, Belarus
received a $450 million government loan in accordance with the 2013 agreement with the
Russian Federation. In addition, $2 billion in bridge financing was disbursed in end-June
as legal arrangements for the government loan from Russia are being finalized. It is also
expected that $440 million from the Anti-Crisis Fund will be disbursed in the second half
of 2014 while foreign exchange denominated bonds in the domestic financial market may
be issued if necessary to help refinance the debt. In 2015, Belarus’ will have to repay
about $3 billion of which the authorities plan to refinance not more than $1.5 billion
externally and domestically. With all the necessary capacity and instruments in place,
they remain confident of their ability to meet Belarus’ external and domestic obligations.

3
Structural reforms are high on the agenda, with a particular emphasis on private sector
development, including through public-private partnership. Consistent incremental steps
are being made towards energy and utility tariff reform, price liberalization, improving
the business climate, and SOE reorganization. Progress on these fronts could have been
faster and macroeconomic adjustments would have been deeper had they been supported
by a Fund program. The authorities regret that the IMF staff is not in a position to present
a Fund-supported program to the Board at the current juncture.
