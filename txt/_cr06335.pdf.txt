In previous consultations, the Fund commended the Chilean authorities for their
continued implementation of sound policies, centered on a prudent fiscal rule, the
inflation targeting framework, and trade liberalization. They noted that these
policies, together with a robust and deep financial system, have led to sustained
economic growth and contributed to a marked reduction in poverty. Prudent policies
have continued to be implemented since the last Article IV consultation, in line with
the recommendations of Executive Directors. In the fiscal area, higher copper
revenues have been sterilized and the overall surplus of the government has been
used to selectively prepay debt and accumulate financial assets.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
Structural reforms and prudent economic policies have helped anchor Chile’s successful
economic performance over the last one-and-a-half decade. Fiscal restraint, including under
the structural surplus rule since 2000, prudent monetary policy in the context of the inflation
targeting framework and a freely floating currency, a sound and deep financial system, and
an outward-looking trade policy have provided Chile with enviably high rates of economic
growth and low inflation.
President Bachelet’s administration, which assumed office in early March, has reaffirmed
its support for the current macroeconomic framework. The new administration has
announced that it would abide by the structural fiscal surplus rule of 1 percent of GDP, while
announcing plans to strengthen social services and undertake a comprehensive reform of the
private pension system.
The authorities are cognizant of the need to gear macroeconomic policies toward
managing the copper boom. Since 2003, the price of copper, Chile’s main export
commodity, has more than tripled. Consistent with the structural surplus rule, and in line with
projected copper prices, the central government would register an overall surplus of close to
6 percent of GDP in 2006. In 2007, an expected increase in the copper reference price would
accommodate higher fiscal spending under the structural surplus rule, but the authorities are
firmly committed to keeping the rate of growth of such spending at a moderate level.
The government has sent a bill to congress to establish rules for investing and managing
the fiscal surpluses. The draft bill envisages using part of the surpluses to invest in a pension
fund and to gradually recapitalize the central bank, and to lodge any remaining surpluses in a
newly-created Fund for Economic and Social Stabilization (FESS). The FESS will be
allowed to invest its assets abroad, to help alleviate upward pressure on the currency.
The central bank is planning to continue gradually removing monetary stimulus. The
central bank considers the policy rate, set at 5 percent since April 2006, below the neutral
rate and projects the output gap to close in 2007. However, in light of a recent slowdown in
economic activity, further interest rate hikes would be largely data-dependent, particularly
with respect to core inflation, non-mining output growth, and the possibility of additional
fiscal stimulus in 2007.
Improving Chile’s private pension system is one of the main priorities of the government.
The government has appointed a commission to formulate proposals on the five main
following issues: low density of contributions; coverage of the social pillar; lack of
competition in the system; rules governing the investments of the funds; and how to increase
the participation of women. The commission is expected to report by early-July to an
interministerial committee which will draft reform legislation. The congressional process is
expected to take place in 2007.

I. BACKGROUND
1.
Structural reforms and prudent economic policies have helped anchor Chile’s
successful economic performance over the past fifteen years. Fiscal restraint, independent
monetary policy, a sound and deep financial system, and an outward-looking trade policy
have provided Chile with enviably high rates of economic growth and low inflation. During
the 15–year period through 2005, its rate of economic growth averaged 5½ percent a year,
per capita income tripled in U. S. dollar terms, and the poverty rate was cut in half, to about
18 percent.1 Income inequality, however, remains high.
2.
Following a sharp slowdown during 1998–2003, Chile has returned to a path of
strong economic growth. In 1998, a sharp drop in the terms of trade, combined with the
impact of global financial turmoil, initiated a prolonged period of slow growth and led to a
jump in the unemployment rate. This was compounded by a sharp increase in domestic
interest rates, which contributed to a contraction in consumer spending. With the
improvement in the global economy and the rise in copper prices since late 2003, economic
growth has rebounded in recent years, from 2½ percent a year on average during 1999–2003
to 6¼ percent during 2004–05. This recovery also testifies to the credibility of Chile’s
consistent policy framework and to the strength of its institutions.
3.
Since 2003, the price of copper, Chile’s main export commodity, has surged to
record-high levels. Chile is the world’s largest copper producer, with one third of global
supply (the copper sector accounts for 15 percent of Chile’s GDP and over 40 percent of its
total exports). Copper prices rose from US$0.8 a pound on average in 2003 to US$3.7 in
May 2006, but have eased somewhat, to US$3.5 in mid-July 2006. The strength in prices has
been driven in part by an increase in world demand (particularly from China), capacity
constraints, low inventories, and a worldwide shift in financial investments toward
commodities.
4.
President Bachelet’s administration, which assumed office in early March, has
reaffirmed its support for the current macroeconomic framework. Upon taking office, the
new administration confirmed that it would abide by the structural surplus rule of 1 percent
of GDP, but also announced its intention to strengthen social services and to undertake a
comprehensive reform of the private pension system.
5.
Against this backdrop, the 2006 consultation discussions centered on three key
issues: (a) the appropriate policy mix, given the current stage of the economic cycle and the
social spending plans of the government; (b) how to manage best the copper boom; and
(c) how to help ensure long-term sustained growth.

II. RECENT DEVELOPMENTS
6.
Since mid-2005, Chile’s rate
of economic growth has moderated,
reflecting a slowdown in investment.
Annualized quarterly GDP growth
has slowed to about 4 percent since
mid–2005 (Figure 1). Domestic
demand remains the main driver of
economic growth but, after a surge in
2004–05, the rate of investment
growth has sharply decelerated while
consumption continues to be strong.
Year-on-year real GDP growth was
5.1 percent in the first quarter of
2006.
7.
The unemployment rate has
dropped to its lowest level since
1999, but it remains above the level
of the last economic expansion
(Figure 2). Employment has
increased sharply since end–2003,
registering a cumulative increase of
8½ percent through end-May 2006.
Nevertheless, the unemployment rate
has continued to hover around
8 percent in seasonally-adjusted
terms (near the top of the central
bank’s estimate of the NAIRU), with
still high unemployment among the
young (close to 20 percent). Since
mid-2005, the 12–month rate of
wage increase has been close to
5¾ percent in nominal terms
(Figure 3).

Headline inflation has
moved to the upper limit of the target range, primarily reflecting higher energy prices.
Since the beginning of 2003, the Chilean peso has appreciated by 25 percent in nominal
terms against the U.S. dollar and by 22 percent in real effective terms (Figure 4). Despite this

6
appreciation, 12–month headline CPI inflation rose steadily during 2005, moving at the top
of the central
bank’s 2–4 percent target range in the
first quarter of 2006. Part of this
increase was driven by petroleum and
nontradable goods prices. Headline
inflation was 3.9 percent in June
2006, with narrowly-defined
12-month core inflation (excluding
perishables, energy, and regulated
prices) at 2.7 percent (up from
1.7 percent a year earlier).

In 2005, the external current
account surplus narrowed from 1½ percent of GDP in 2004 to ½ percent of GDP. Driven
by the rise in copper prices, Chile’s terms of trade improved by 12½ percent, on top of a
21 percent increase in 2004. Despite the appreciation of the peso, non-mining exports have
continued to grow strongly, albeit at a slower pace than in the previous year (volume rose by
10 percent in 2005). These factors were more than offset by a drop in mining export volume
(by 3 percent from 2004, a year during which exports had been boosted by inventory sales)
and a sharp rise in imports (21 percent in volume terms).
10.
Chile has continued to adhere strictly to a sound macroeconomic framework.
Consistent with the structural surplus rule and copper price levels, the central government
registered an overall surplus of 4¾ percent of GDP in 2005, up from 2¼ percent in 2004. The
surplus was used by the government in broadly equal amounts to prepay debt and increase its
liquid asset holdings. The central bank continued to manage monetary policy prudently, in
the context of the inflation targeting framework. Since September 2004, it has raised its
policy rate by a total of 325 basis
points, to 5 percent, in response to the

Vulnerability indicators have continued to improve, reflecting strong economic
growth and the strengthening of the fiscal position. The ratio of net public sector debt
(including central bank debt) to GDP fell from about 13 percent in 2003 to 7½ percent in
2005; over the same period, gross public sector debt declined from 44½ percent of GDP to
31½ percent. Private sector indebtedness abroad fell sharply (by 15 percentage points), to
close to 31 percent of GDP at end–2005. Gross official international reserves, at
US$17 billion (15 percent of 2005 GDP), are equivalent to close to 110 percent of Chile’s
short-term external debt, covering close to five months of imports of good and services.
12.
The recent correction in emerging market assets had a limited impact in Chile,
confirming the resilience of the economy. In June, the Chilean peso depreciated by almost
3 percent against the U.S. dollar and the stock market fell by about 1½ percent, both from
elevated levels. Chile’s sovereign spreads, however, tightened slightly, to around 80 basis
points, in contrast to the widening in Latin America EMBI spreads.
III. OUTLOOK
13.
The outlook for Chile is positive, reflecting strong prospects for copper and robust
domestic demand. Global demand and the improvement in the terms of trade are expected to
support investor and consumer confidence, underpinning strong domestic demand. Real GDP
is projected to grow by 5-6 percent in 2006–07, as the economic cycle matures, and inflation
is projected to gradually return to the middle of the inflation target range. Reflecting the
impact of higher copper prices, the central government is expected to register a surplus of
close to 6 percent of GDP in 2006, while the external current account surplus would widen to
about 2 percent of GDP.
14.
The risks to the outlook appear broadly balanced. Global imbalances remain at
elevated levels, carrying the risk of a disorderly adjustment and a sudden reversal in investor
sentiment. Disruptions in the supply of natural gas from Argentina and further increases in
oil prices could also negatively impact growth in Chile. On the upside, the continued strength
of global growth could push economic growth in 2006–07 beyond current projections.
•

Global and regional risks. A disorderly adjustment in global imbalances and
increased uncertainty about interest rates in the U.S. could weigh more heavily on
emerging market assets than the recent sell-off, lead to a pronounced drop in
commodity prices and available financing, and negatively impact growth. Regional
political developments could also reduce investors’ appetite for Latin American risks
and affect capital flows. Chile enjoys an investment grade rating and should, in

8
principle, be sheltered from such developments, but its asset prices have in the past
shown a close correlation with regional movements, especially in Brazil.2
•

Energy. Disruptions in the supply of gas from Argentina and further oil price
increases could put pressure on production costs and weigh down economic growth.
Since 2004, Argentina has reduced its gas exports to Chile. Gas cuts in the second
quarter of 2006 were close to 40 percent on average, up from 30 percent during the
same period last year. Although these cuts have not thus far had a major impact on
economic growth, there is a risk that deeper cuts could materialize. These risks are
somewhat mitigated by the fact that three-fourths of Chilean firms that use gas in
their production process have already converted their plants to alternative sources of
energy. Staff estimates that the effect of further increases in oil prices would be
moderate (e.g., a 10 percent increase above the baseline scenario could reduce GDP
growth by a ¼ of a percentage point).

•

Copper prices. Low stocks and little recent capacity expansion have combined with
rising demand, especially from China, to raise copper prices to record levels.
Speculative capital has flowed into copper as well, increasing volatility and the risk of
a sudden price correction. However, analysts expect market conditions to continue
supporting high prices, at least in the near-to-medium term.
IV. REPORT ON THE DISCUSSIONS

15.
Discussions took place against the backdrop of the surge in world copper prices.
With the economy close to full potential, discussions focused on how best to manage this
stage of the cycle, at a time when the tightening of monetary policy was being gradually felt
through the economy. The authorities considered that one of the main challenges for
economic policy was how to deal with the copper boom, which they considered temporary.
They noted that the attendant increase in government revenue would boost spending
pressures at a time when the output gap was closing. However, they were committed to avoid
placing excessive pressure on resources and, to that effect, to limit aggregate demand growth.
To further help alleviate upward pressure on the currency and avoid Dutch disease effects,
the authorities announced their intention to lodge abroad part of the financial assets
accumulated by the government.3

2

Chile’s sovereign spreads remain the lowest in the region. In July, Moody’s upgraded Chile's foreign currency
sovereign rating from Baa1 to A2, one of only three investment-grade ratings in Latin America.

3

As of April 2006, the government had accumulated US$6 billion in assets, of which US$3.8 billion were
invested abroad.

9
16.
A key question for Chile is how to help ensure long-term sustained economic
growth. The potential rate of growth is estimated at around 5 percent a year, with trend
productivity growth estimated at ½–1 percent, significantly slower than its 2 percent annual
growth observed during the 1990s. Increasing long-term productivity growth will require
the adoption of structural reforms to improve competitiveness, skills, and economic
efficiency at the microeconomic level. Economic growth would also benefit from labor
market reform to combat still-high unemployment rates, particularly among the young, and
improve labor force participation by women, which remains low by international standards.
Macroeconomic policy mix
17.
The gradual tightening in monetary policy has helped moderate pressures on
resources. Most analysts were of the opinion that the output gap was gradually closing, but
there were differences of views on its timing. Central bank staff considered that the gap
would close by early 2007, while some private analysts thought that the large investments
undertaken in 2004–05, together with the significant increase in labor force participation,
would push the closing of the gap into the future. Given the paucity of data on labor costs
and on resource pressures more generally, it was difficult to assess with precision the extent
to which the recent increase in various measures of inflation reflected capacity constraints.4
The staff considered that the increase in headline inflation mostly reflected the pass-through
from oil price increases, and that the upward trend in core inflation signaled a meanreversion to its well-anchored level of 3 percent, after a drop in 2004 caused by a sharp
appreciation of the peso.

A new labor survey, in operation since January, created a break in the series, complicating assessment of labor

average price observed in previous years. These changes have helped reduce the cyclicality
of fiscal spending. In the year to April, spending by the central government rose by
5.5 percent in real terms over the same period in 2005, below the budgeted increase of
6.3 percent, while higher copper revenues boosted the surplus to 3.8 percent of annual GDP.
19.
In the period ahead, the authorities are committed to keeping the rate of growth of
fiscal spending at moderate levels. The authorities noted that social spending, particularly in
health and education, would rise in 2007 and in subsequent years, consistent with the
program of the new administration. However, they also reaffirmed their commitment to the
fiscal surplus rule of 1 percent of GDP and emphasized the importance of moderation in
expenditure growth, to avoid aggregate demand pressures at a time when the output gap was
closing. They recognized that the long-term copper reference price, to be announced by the
Copper Committee in July, would be critical to the 2007 fiscal stance, and expressed their
confidence that the Committee would be conservative in its assessment.7 The authorities also
noted that the envisaged medium-term increases in social expenditure, planned before the
recent upswing in copper prices, were consistent with such a conservative assessment. They
also shared staff’s view that care should be taken to avoid too sharp an increase in recurrent
spending, to avoid creating fiscal rigidities in subsequent years. To that effect, they intended
to give priority in the 2007 budget to non–recurrent outlays and the purchase of tradable
goods.
20.
Buoyant fiscal revenues offer an opportunity to reduce distortionary taxes. Staff
noted that the stamp tax, which is paid every time a debt security is issued or a bank credit is
extended, constitutes an impediment to efficiency in the financial system. It recommended
equating the incidence of the tax across maturities and eliminating it for some operations,
including on-lent bank borrowing from abroad. The authorities acknowledged the possible
efficiency gains from a modification, including through higher competition in the banking
sector, but noted that revenue collections from the tax were significant (0.6 percent of GDP
in 2005). As a first step, they planned to eliminate the tax for the refinancing of loans
(a measure already in place for mortgage loans since 2003) and indicated that they might
consider other changes at a later stage. They also planned to send a bill to congress to
simplify the tax regime for small and medium enterprises. The mission also suggested
eliminating the small tax on electronic transactions and checks, to help widen access to
banking services.
21.
The central bank plans to continue gradually removing monetary stimulus. The
authorities and staff concurred that the recent slowdown in economic activity reflected a
weakness in supply, driven by specific factors which included the adverse effect of poor
weather conditions on agriculture, and that macroeconomic policies could do little to offset
7

The 2007 budget will include interest on accumulated fiscal surpluses as structural revenue, allowing for an up
tick in expenditure. Beyond this, expenditure increases are expected to remain broadly in line with GDP growth.

11
this. The central bank considered that the policy rate, set at 5 percent since April 2006,
remained below the neutral rate. The authorities and staff agreed that such further moves
would be largely data-dependent, particularly with respect to new data on core inflation,
nonmining output growth, industrial production, and capital good imports. The monetary
stance would also need to take into account, if needed, the possibility of additional fiscal
stimulus in 2007.
22.
Chile’s economic data are generally of good quality, but there is room for
improvement, particularly with respect to the CPI and labor cost components.8 The
authorities indicated that steps were underway to expand the CPI survey sample outside
Santiago, and saw merit in staff’s suggestion to undertake a new household expenditure
survey and use hedonic price analysis to take into account changes in the quality of goods
and services. In the area of labor cost statistics, the mission suggested that the recently
overhauled establishment survey may need to be reviewed to ensure data quality with respect
to compensation and hours worked. The mission also noted that, while aggregate expenditure
data collected by the Central Bank were timely and comprehensive, data on inventories could
be improved to help distinguish better between persistent consumption shifts and transitory
stockpiling increases. The authorities and staff agreed that such changes, which would
require significant investments in time and labor, would bring considerable dividends.
Managing the copper boom
23.
The Chilean macroeconomic framework is sound and has grown increasingly
effective at managing external shocks. Since the late 1990s, the introduction of the fiscal
rule, inflation targeting in the context of a floating exchange rate, and trade openness have
significantly enhanced the resilience of the economy. In addition, the financial system is
solid and has deepened further in recent years, particularly with the development of the bond
and derivatives markets, improving the capacity of the economy to absorb shocks. Welldesigned social policies have also helped ensure policy sustainability in the face of continued
high income inequality. There is room to strengthen some areas of policy, however, and this
has been highlighted by the unprecedented size of the current copper boom.
24.
The mission welcomed the authorities’ commitment to continue letting the peso
float freely, despite renewed pressures to intervene in the foreign exchange market. Since
2003, the peso has appreciated by 22 percent in real effective terms, and some sectors of the
economy have called for the central bank to intervene in the foreign exchange market. The
central bank has reaffirmed its position that it would only intervene if the following three
conditions were met: (i) there is evidence of a misalignment of the currency; (ii) such a
misalignment impacts negatively on economic activity; and (iii) intervention has a good

Forecasting at the Central Bank of Chile.

12
chance of success at correcting the misalignment. The authorities did not think that any of
these conditions were met, and reaffirmed their plans to let the peso float freely. Staff shared
the central bank’s view, noting that this policy has enhanced the development of a deep and
efficient market for hedging foreign exchange rate risks. In addition, the peso does not seem
out of line with long-term trends (Figure 7) and the growth of nonmining exports has
remained strong, an indication that the level of the currency is not hurting competitiveness.
25.
The authorities’ decision to define a policy for investing the fiscal surpluses is
sound. The government has recently sent a bill to congress to establish rules for investing
and managing the fiscal surpluses:

to 0.5 percent) of previous-year’s GDP would be invested in a pension fund aimed at
covering future pension liabilities of the government (Figure 8). The amounts in the
fund would remain locked for a 10–year period; its investment policies would be

surpluses would be lodged in a newly-created fund, the FESS. This fund would
operate in a transparent manner and, to that effect, the government plans to inform the
public on the composition of its assets on a quarterly basis. It will be allowed to
invest its assets abroad, with a view to helping alleviate upward pressure on the
currency. The guidelines would initially allow foreign investment only in government
and high-grade corporate bonds. The authorities and staff agreed that investments
could become more diversified in the future, including with investment in equities.

Boosting Long-Term Growth
26.
Boosting long-run total factor productivity growth is a major challenge for Chile.
This will require building on the existing strengths of the Chilean economy through greater
efficiency in the financial sector, further enhancements in human capital through education
and Research and Development (R&D), and reforms to increase labor productivity. A crosscutting theme is the need to step up competition in the economy. Efficiency improvements in
the labor and financial markets will contribute to this goal, but the authorities explained that
they were also taking steps to strengthen competition policy, with a view to reducing
conflicts of interest in corporate governance, increasing fines for antitrust violations while
tying them to damages, and protecting whistleblowers.
Reforming the pension system
27.
Improving Chile’s privatized pension system is one of the priorities of the
government. Since their creation in 1981, private pension funds have grown to manage
around US$68 billion in assets, equivalent to three-fifths of Chile’s GDP. A commission has
been appointed by the government to hear from specialists and a wide spectrum of society
about their concerns on the pension system, discuss possible areas of reform, and develop
specific proposals. The commission will report by early-July to an interministerial committee
which will draft reform legislation, expected to be sent to congress by late 2006 (Box 1). The

15
Box 1. Chile: Pension Reform
The commission has been charged with formulating responses to five main issues: low density of
contributions; coverage of the social pillar; competition; rules governing the investments of funds; and
how to increase the participation of women.
Chile’s pension system suffers from low density and contribution rates, particularly among the
young and the self-employed. While the system currently does an exemplary job at providing for the
retirement of workers spending their adult lives in formal employment, various studies have shown that
retirement income is uncertain for part of Chile’s workforce. Many workers, particularly young and
informal-sector workers, do not understand the need to save in a private account, and education in this
area has been neglected. Many self-employed workers are in the formal sector, but increasing their
participation (currently only 5 percent participate in the pension system) would require addressing
differences in taxation and benefits between the self-employed and others.
The current system does not provide a sufficient safety net for the poor elderly. The pension system
was designed to provide a minimum benefit to participants after at least 20 years of participation. A
welfare pension is available to the very poor, but eligibility is based on broad assistance-program
requirements and takes into account other considerations than income; the minimum pension guarantee
is tied only to years of contribution, not need. The commission is researching ways to tie old-age
security more closely into the pension system, such as by changing the eligibility requirement for a
minimum pension from a time basis to a financial threshold, which would benefit the self-employed
and temporary workers (their contributions are not frequent enough to achieve the 20-year minimum
record). Any increase in government support for this pillar is likely to be costly, and observers expect
this to be funded from general revenue, rather than an additional “solidarity contribution” from workers
or employers.
The Chilean pension-fund industry has become monopolistic. The need for a sales force, marketing,
and sizeable front- and back-office operations has created significant economies of scale. The
commission is analyzing proposals that would reduce costs by separating the management of
investments from the administration of accounts. However, studies have found that Chilean workers do
not respond elastically to private pension fees (estimated at 2.4 percent of wages). Other proposals
include effectively auctioning the accounts of groups of workers (sorted possibly by age or
occupational category) to pension funds, allocating new workers to the lowest-cost funds, or restricting
the ability of workers to move into higher-cost funds.
Rules for investment of pension-fund assets are generally seen as too restrictive. Complex
restrictions on portfolio risk, foreign investment, and asset allocation have combined to depress overall
returns and reduce the variance among funds’ returns. The commission is looking at streamlining the
more than ninety limits and sub-limits that govern investments in order to increase the funds’ ability to
respond to market conditions and at codifying the rules as administrative regulations, to improve
flexibility.
Women gain much less than men from the pension system, due to a confluence of issues. Lower
wages, more informal employment, childbearing responsibilities, earlier retirement ages, and longer
life spans combine to reduce the retirement earnings of women under the current system. Proposals to
address the gender disparity in pension earnings focus on the need to encourage more years of
contribution for women, for example, by delaying the retirement age (currently, about 60 percent of
workers retire early; the average retirement age for women is 54 years and 57 for men), making early
retirement less attractive, or subsidizing the pension contributions of mothers. President Bachelet has
announced other measures to encourage higher female workforce participation, which may help
mitigate the problem.

staff recommended making participation in the pension system compulsory for the selfemployed and rationalizing investment restrictions on the pension funds, including raising
the limit on investments abroad. The authorities saw merit in these recommendations and
noted that they awaited the report of the pension committee to formulate specific policies.
Improving Competition in the Financial Sector
28.
Prudential indicators continue to show that the banking system is sound, with high
capital, a low level of impaired assets, and high provisioning. The authorities were closely
tracking developments in consumer credit, which had continued to rise rapidly (the
12–month increase in real terms was 22 percent at end-March), but noted that it accounted
for only a small portion (15 percent) of total bank credit and, as such, did not represent a
systemic risk to the financial sector. Staff emphasized the need to improve consolidated
information on credit risks in the financial sector and, to that effect, supported the creation of
a central credit database covering not only banks but also cooperatives and department store
credit card lending (estimated to account for at least 20 percent of total consumer credit).
With respect to small and medium-sized enterprises, the mission advised the authorities to
introduce mechanisms aimed at ensuring the collection of data under a simplified version of
the FecuPymes reporting system.
29.
The authorities intend to continue pressing forward with the draft Capital Market
Law II, which has not made headway in congress in recent months, partly due to its broad
coverage and technical complexity. They were considering various alternatives to move
ahead with the reform, including giving consideration to narrowing its scope in order to
ensure early passage by congress. The draft law would bring wide-ranging improvements to
several existing laws and introduce incentives for risk capital and entrepreneurship, a new
national registry for pledges aimed at improving SMEs’ access to financing, strengthen
corporate governance legislation to bring it to OECD standards, and increase powers for the
superintendents to share information. A separate draft law, aiming at restoring some of the
powers of the Financial Intelligence Unit, is expected to be approved by congress in the near
future; passage of this law is critical to ensure that the FIU is capable of effectively
combating money laundering.
30.
In recent years, the domestic bond market has grown steadily, but it remains
characterized by a relatively low level of activity. Staff recommended that liquidity be
improved by relaxing some of the investment restrictions on the private pension funds and
reviewing the procedures surrounding the taxation of foreign investors.9 Staff also suggested
removing the distortions caused by the stamp tax and considering introducing a system of
specialists in public debt with obligations tailored to the needs of the market. As the Central

Bank has successfully set out an explicit objective for its debt management and effectively
communicated it to the market, the government should do so as well. Sporadic bond issuance
by the Finance Ministry has created uncertainty in the market, highlighting the need for a
coordinated medium-term debt management strategy with the Central Bank. An assetliability management approach would suggest that the Finance Ministry should concentrate
on the long end of the curve, including through inflation-indexed issues, providing
benchmarks at the longer tenors and complementing the Central Bank’s issuance at the
medium- and shorter-tenors. The authorities considered that they needed more time to
specify their policy in this area. The Central Bank authorities also noted that, since the last
Article IV consultation, they had made public key aspects of their reserve management
policy, including with respect to currency composition.

supported this approach, while noting the pressing need for action in this area, as
unemployment is still high and the labor market plagued with rigidities (Figure 12). Chile’s

labor force participation rates are low by international standards, particularly for the young

•

Increasing employment for the young and women is a priority of the government.
To help enhance job creation for the young, the authorities agreed that there was
some room to make more intensive use of short-term and part-time contracts for
them. The government plans to subsidize 50 percent of the minimum wage for some
1,500 first-time young workers and extend this benefit to workers up to 25 years old
(from 21years old at present). Bonuses will also be offered to firms that employ
youths at social risk. With respect to women, the authorities considered that the
broadening of childcare coverage would help improve their participation in the labor
force.

20
•

Severance payments are high by international standards. Severance payments in
Chile, equivalent to one month’s wages for each year of service (up to a maximum of
11 months’ wages), are considered to hinder job creation. Workers’ dismissal rules
are generally flexible, but the rules governing permissible dismissals remain narrowly
defined, hampering the matching of jobs with employees’ skills, and penalties for
unjustified dismissal are usually prohibitively high.

•

Chile’s minimum wage is relatively high, hindering formal employment contracts,
particularly for the unskilled. In July 2005, the previous government increased the
minimum wage by 6¼ percent and announced that it would be raised again by close
to 6 percent in July 2006,

•

In the formal sector, about one fourth of all workers are under temporary work
arrangements. Chile does not allow fixed-term employment contracts with a duration
of more than a year. In practice, this is often circumvented by annual contracts which
are renewed at the end of each year, the use of subcontractor services, and the hiring
of temporary workers. A draft law was recently approved in congress, requiring firms
to ascertain that their subcontractors comply with existing labor and social security
regulations. The government planned to veto some aspects of the draft law, with a
view to ensuring that it does not lead to excessive bureaucratic demands and to the
introduction of new rigidities.

33.
Access to energy is key for Chile to ensure sustainable long-term growth. In the
electricity sector, the approval in 2005 of changes in the regulatory framework has led to a
strong increase in investment in electricity generation, including hydroelectric capacity.
Faced with the uncertainty associated with the supply from Argentina, Chile has worked to
reduce its reliance on natural gas. In the Northern part of the country, many mining
companies have been investing in their own sources of energy supply, including coal and
diesel plants. Concerns about the reliability of supply to the center of the country have led the
government to initiate construction of a liquid natural gas terminal near Santiago.
34.
The authorities and staff agreed that trade liberalization has served Chile well.
Officials noted that Chile has one the lowest tariff rates in the world and that almost four-

multilateral trade liberalization.

V. STAFF APPRAISAL
35.
With a very favorable external environment, prospects for the Chilean economy
remain strong, notwithstanding the recent slowdown in activity. Economic growth has
slowed since mid–2005, in part because investment has returned to a more sustainable rate of
growth after a spurt during the previous two years. Consumer confidence remains high,
private consumption is growing at a sustainable rate, and the economy is set to continue
expanding at a steady pace in 2006 and 2007.
36.
Risks to the outlook are mitigated by the quality of macroeconomic policies. The
fiscal surplus rule, inflation targeting in the context of a floating exchange rate, and trade
openness have significantly improved the resilience of the Chilean economy. In addition, the
financial system is solid and has deepened in recent years with the development of the bond
and futures markets, improving the capacity of the economy to absorb shocks. The relatively
modest reaction to the recent sell-off in emerging markets confirms Chile’s resilience to
market turbulence and the ability of the markets to differentiate Chile from other risks in the
region.
37.
Macroeconomic policymaking remains first-rate and well coordinated. The
authorities are appropriately treating the sharp increase in copper price as temporary. Fiscal
policy has continued to be managed prudently, with expenditure growth tied via the structural
surplus rule to Chile’s long-term revenue capacity, while the central bank is appropriately
gradually removing monetary stimulus. Chile’s external competitiveness does not appear to
have suffered from the appreciation of the currency, as nonmineral exports have continued to
perform well. Staff supports the authorities’ decision to invest part of the fiscal surpluses
abroad while providing more transparency in the information given to the public. A prudent

22
fiscal policy stance, together with investing the fiscal surpluses abroad, should help limit
upward pressure on the currency.
38.
The uncertainty surrounding measures of the output gap poses a challenge to
policymakers. Central bank estimates point to a closing of the gap in early 2007, but some
computations show that the gap may still persist next year, reflecting large investments and a
sizeable labor force growth in recent years. The recent pickup in inflation in early 2006
seems to largely reflect the effect of higher energy prices; there are also no conclusive data
on possible pressures on resources and labor costs.
39.
Against this background, staff agreed with the authorities that the monetary stance
in the period ahead should largely be data driven. Inflation expectations remain well
anchored near the mid-point of the inflation target range, and the central bank’s
communications strategy with the markets works well. Given that the policy rate remains
below the neutral rate, there is still room for the central bank to remove stimulus, particularly
if fiscal policy were to become more expansionary in 2007.
40.
The 2007 budget should keep the growth in central government expenditure at a
moderate level. Under the structural surplus rule, revenue in 2007 could be boosted by an
increase in the reference price for copper, leading to undesirable pressures to expand
spending. Beyond their commitment to the rule as a disciplining device, the authorities have
helpfully reaffirmed their intention to limit expenditure increases in the 2007 budget and to
give prominence to nonrecurrent spending.
41.
Staff welcomes the government’s intention to gradually recapitalize the central
bank. The government’s plans to provide the central bank with about half of its capital need
over a five-year period will help strengthen the institutional independence of the bank as well
as its foreign reserves position, but it will not allow the central bank to cover all its losses.
Although the fiscal surpluses provided an opportunity for an upfront and full recapitalization
of the central bank, the government’ decision to opt for gradual recapitalization reflects the
need to take political constraints into account.
42.
The rapid increase in consumer credit growth requires vigilance and better
information sharing between banks and non-bank credit card issuers. To enhance the
consolidation of risk information, it would be desirable to create a central database applied
not only to banks but also to cooperatives and credit card lending by department stores.
Proceeding with a simplified version of the FecuPymes reporting system would help provide
better information on credit risks of small and medium-sized enterprises and improve their
access to financing.
43.
To enhance efficiency and competition in the financial sector, the scope and rate of
the stamp tax should be reduced. Beyond the government’s plans to waive the stamp tax in
the refinancing of existing loans, a more comprehensive reform of the stamp tax would help
reduce the costs of financial intermediation and encourage competition, by giving borrowers

23
more flexibility in securing the best cost of financing possible. Consideration should also be
given to eliminating the small tax on electronic transactions and checks.
44.
Improving liquidity in the capital market is a priority. The government is
encouraged to develop a medium-term public debt strategy, beyond the political cycle, and
decide if it will maintain a presence in issuing bonds. Regulations are needed to clarify
exemptions from capital gains tax for foreign institutional investors. This may help enhance
further the development of the financial sector and contribute to internationalizing the peso.
45.
Improving the quality of human capital and boosting innovation is key to Chile’s
long-term development. The new administration has placed education at the top of its
priorities, with plans to generalize pre-school care, broaden university education for the poor,
and provide grants to study abroad. Its plan to support R&D and innovation, based on
successful experiences abroad, appears well placed.
46.
The labor market remains in need of further reform. The authorities’ approach in
this area, aimed at seeking consensus among the main social partners, is well advised. Staff
urges the authorities to take bold action in this area, to help address the still high
unemployment rate—especially among the young—and improve labor force participation. In
particular, reforms should aim at introducing more flexibility in working hours, allowing
longer fixed-term contracts, and avoiding too rapid increases in the minimum wages rather
than subsidizing them.
47.
Further improving data quality and coverage would help improve economic
management. Strengthening data quality in the areas of the consumer price index, labor
indicators, and inventories would help better assess short-term developments. These
improvements would likely require a significant investment in time and labor, but would
bring considerable dividends over time.
48.

It is recommended that the next consultation occur on the usual 12-month cycle.

Technical Assistance: In October 2002, a mission from MFD and WHD advised on
nominalization and interest rate pass-through. In January 2003, a joint FAD/STA mission
advised on fiscal statistics. In late 2003 and early 2004, an FSAP mission (joint FundBank) assessed the Chilean financial system. In late 2004, a STA mission advised on
fiscal statistics. Another STA mission in February, 2005 advised on national account
statistics. An MFD mission trained the FIU staff on AML/CFT issues in 2005 and an FAD
mission conducted a pilot study on fiscal risks of public enterprises. In 2006 two MFD
missions advised on coverage and quality of short term economic indicators, and on
strengthening liquidity in fixed-income markets.

35
APPENDIX II. CHILE—FINANCIAL RELATIONS WITH THE WORLD BANK
The most recent Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) for Chile, covering Fiscal Years
2002-06, was discussed by the Executive Board of the Bank in February 2002. The CAS
calls for selectively focusing on areas in which the Bank had accumulated substantial
knowledge and where the government felt that the Bank can be instrumental in ensuring the
successful implementation of its initiatives. To that aim, the strategy proposed to diversify
the forms of financial assistance by providing direct financing through regular investment
and policy-based lending, as well as contingent financing. A new CAS is planned for the
second quarter of FY07.
The CAS reflects efforts by the current administration to address persistent social
challenges through improvements in human capital. Support in the area of human capital
development has been provided through the Science for Knowledge Economy Project
(FY03), which fosters the development of an effective innovation system and aims at
improving the stock of human capital in the Chilean science and technology sector.
Additional support in this area has been provided through the Lifelong Learning and Training
Project (FY02), which aims at assisting in establishing the foundation of a lifelong learning
and training system with the participation of the private sector.
The CAS also reflects the current administration’s focus on improving the inclusion of
rural populations and vulnerable groups and the social safety net. In line with this
objective, in FY05 the Bank approved the Infrastructure for Rural Development Project,
which aims at improving the access of rural communities to infrastructure services. Support
in the area of social protection has been provided under the Social Protection Adjustment
Loan DDO (FY04) and the accompanying TA loan, which aims at increasing access to social
protection and social services for the neediest households. This loan also supports Chile
Solidario.
The IFC provides support for private infrastructure, small and medium enterprises,
specialized financing in housing, and the social sector. The IFC considers that Chile is a
country from which experience can be learned for other countries, both within and outside
the Latin America region. In addition, the IFC provides support to Chilean companies in their
efforts to grow abroad. MIGA’s support is expected to facilitate foreign direct investment in
Chile.
There are currently seven investment loans in Chile’s operations portfolio, totaling
US$215.1 million in commitments. The seven loans, in support of Public Expenditure
Management (FY02), Lifelong Learning (FY02), Science for the Knowledge Economy
(FY03), Social Protection TA Loan (FY04), Infrastructure for Territorial Development
(FY05), Transantiago TA (FY06) and Tertiary Education Finance for Results (FY06) are
covered by the current CAS. A Santiago Urban Transport Adjustment Loan in the amount of
US$30.2 million, also approved in FY06, has been fully disbursed.

APPENDIX III. CHILE: STATISTICAL ISSUES
Economic and financial data are timely, of good quality, and adequate for surveillance
purposes. Chile is in observance with the Special Data Dissemination Standards (SDDS).
Monetary sector
Monetary and financial statistics are broadly in line with the Fund’s Monetary and
Financial Statistics Manual (MFSM). There are only few deviations from the guidelines of the
MFSM, i.e., the inclusion of nonbank financial intermediaries in the private sector, and the use of
accounting valuation criteria, which are not always in line with the measurements at market
prices prescribed by the MFSM. Nevertheless, for purposes of expressing in local currency,
assets and liabilities in foreign currency and indexed units of account, the accounting criterion is
consistent, in general terms, with the MFSM (see accounting conventions and other aspects).
Real sector
A change to 2003 as the benchmark and base year is planned to take place in 2007. Annual
and quarterly GDP series for 1986–2003 are scheduled to be compiled in 2007. An STA mission
to Chile in January 2006 found that the overall strategy, planning, and implementation of the
benchmarking exercise, as well as the professional standard of the methods used are of a high
standard when measured against similar projects in other countries and internationally
recognized best practices. However, the 2003 benchmarking will not benefit from a new
household expenditure survey or a census for agriculture. Currently, the BCCH compiles annual
and quarterly national accounts with 1996 as the base (and benchmark) year. Following technical
assistance from STA, new and more comprehensive GDP series were published by the central
bank in March 2005.
Plans are for a much improved business register to be available in 2006. The January 2006
mission recommended that the present method for the treatment of imputed rent of owner
occupied dwellings be reconsidered with a view to better reflect current market conditions.
There is room to improve price and labor market statistics. For the CPI, expanding the
survey sample outside Santiago and updating the weights to the 2006-2007 HBS would
considerably improve the index. On labor market statistics, the National Statistical Institute
(INE) introduced a new household survey in 2006, modeled on the U.S. BLS surveys and in
line with standards set by the International Labor Organization. The recent labor market
survey of business establishments could also benefit from a similar review to improve data
quality.
Government finances
Following agreements reached with the Fund in 2002, the authorities have made
substantial progress in implementing the GFSM 2001. They made significant

38
improvements regarding coverage, classification, and consolidation. The authorities have
developed a statement of central government operations with consolidation of extra
budgetary central government units, and the reclassification of budgetary revenue and
spending. A new functional classification of total outlays for the central government aligned
with international standards has been disseminated. In addition separate sets of accounts were
compiled for municipalities and for public corporations. A detailed description of the
methodologies, institutional tables on coverage, and data for the entire public sector were
made available in the October 2004 publication Estadísticas de las Finanzas Públicas
1987-2003.
Progress in the fiscal accounts is ongoing. The authorities expect to produce estimates for
the consumption of fixed capital and apply accrual and cash accounting using the System of
Information for the Financial Management of the Public Sector. This will permit the
compilation of opening and closing balance sheets covering the central government,
municipalities and public corporations.
Following 2004 FAD recommendations to reinforce fiscal transparency, the Ministry of
Finance included complementary information in the October 2004 Public Finance
Report on the Budget Law Project. It includes debt liabilities and financial assets of the
central government, contingent liabilities (especially government guarantees and
concessions), and tax expenditures. In 2006 the government began to publish a report of
investments of its assets.
However, further improvements are needed. The most urgent are disaggregating subsidies
and grants by level of government; disseminating more detailed data on functional outlays by
the level of government; disseminating data on military debt; and reconciling the recording
of interest across liabilities, especially with regard to dollar-denominated bonds versus
dollar-indexed bonds.
Balance of payments and external debt
The central bank compiles balance of payments and external debt statistics on a
quarterly basis, and publishes selected statistics on the external sector on a weekly
basis. Beginning in 2002, the central bank has been publishing the International Investment
Position consistent with the fifth edition of the Balance of Payments Manual (BPM5).
The coverage of the military sector in the external statistics is not complete. In particular,
the accuracy of data on military imports needs to be verified, as imports that do not go
through customs are estimated by the central bank. Also, if the military receives external
credits, information on this may not be available to the central bank; therefore, such
financing may not appear in the balance of payments or external debt statistics. Published
data on military expenditure are outdated.

12/ Assumes that key variables (real GDP growth, real interest rate, and other identified debt-creating flows) remain at the level of the last projection year.

1/ Gross debt of the central government. The forecast for the debt stock implicitly includes the effect of the redemption of recognition bonds (amortizations amount to around 1¼ percent of GDP annually in the forecast horizon). The recognition bonds are converted to debt,
if the fiscal surplus is not large enough to cover the entire financing needs for the year.
2/ Derived as [(r - p(1+g) - g + ae(1+r)]/(1+g+p+gp)) times previous period debt ratio, with r = interest rate; p = growth rate of GDP deflator; g = real GDP growth rate; a = share of foreign-currency denominated debt; and ε = nominal exchange rate depreciation
(measured by increase in local currency value of U.S. dollar).
3/ The real interest rate contribution is derived from the denominator in footnote 2/ as r - π (1+g) and the real growth contribution as -g.
4/ The exchange rate contribution is derived from the numerator in footnote 2/ as ae(1+r).
5/ For projections, this line includes exchange rate changes.
6/ Defined as public sector deficit, plus amortization of medium and long-term public sector debt, plus short-term debt at end of previous period.
7/ Derived as nominal interest expenditure divided by previous period debt stock.
8/ The key variables include real GDP growth; real interest rate; and primary balance in percent of GDP.
9/ The implied change in other key variables under this scenario is discussed in the text.
10/ The two-standard deviation estimate is from 1996-2004, because of the exceptional growth rate in 1995 (10 percent) distorts the results.
11/ Real depreciation is defined as nominal depreciation (measured by percentage fall in dollar value of local currency) minus domestic inflation (based on GDP deflator).

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND
CHILE
Staff Report for the 2006 Article IV Consultation
Supplementary Information
Prepared by the Western Hemisphere and Policy Development and Review Departments
Approved by Markus Rodlauer and Adrienne Cheasty
July 26, 2006

This supplement provides an update of policy developments since the release of the staff report
(www.imf.org). The thrust of the staff appraisal remains unchanged.
1.
In its July meeting, the central bank increased its policy rate by 25 basis points (to
5.25 percent) and announced that further monetary tightening would be data-dependent and
more gradual.
2.
The presidential commission appointed to suggest proposals for the reform of the
pension system presented its findings on July 6, 2006. The report recommends the creation of a
solidarity pillar guaranteeing a basic universal pension for the poor, introducing a requirement
for the self-employed to contribute, streamlining and liberalizing the pension fund investment
regime, and separating account and investment management functions. In the coming months,
the government is expected to decide how to go forward with the pension reform, including
which proposals of the commission to retain, and to send a draft bill to congress to that effect.
3.
On July 20, the Minister of Finance announced a set of reforms aimed at encouraging
entrepreneurship, improving technological competitiveness, deepening the capital markets, and
continuing to build modern institutions. Some of these measures have a limited fiscal impact,
which the authorities plan to accommodate under the structural surplus rule. The main measures
are as follows:
•

The draft fiscal responsibility law (see www.imf.org for details) was designated a
legislative priority, to ensure its expeditious passage by congress.

•

The government plans to rekindle the legislative process on the draft Capital Market II
reform bill in August, and to send a revised bill to congress to ensure its prompt
approval.

2
•

The government will seek legislative approval to streamline financial taxation,
including with a proposal to gradually reduce the stamp tax rate from 1.6 percent at
present to 1.2 percent by 2009 and to exempt all refinancing operations from the tax.
The government also plans to issue regulations to simplify the capital gains tax and
clarify the conditions for exemptions, in line with staff recommendations.

•

To enhance the internationalization of the peso, the government plans to facilitate the
issuance of peso bonds by foreign investors, including multilateral organizations, in
both the Chilean market and abroad. The settlement and netting arrangements for
derivative instruments will be brought to international standards.

•

To improve technology and innovation the authorities plan to unify taxes on imported
software, patents, and other technological services, at a reduced rate of 15 percent. They
also plan to provide subsidies and tax exemptions for research and development
spending by private companies.

Public Information Notice (PIN) No. 06/97
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
August 11, 2006

International Monetary Fund
700, 19th Street, NW
Washington, D. C. 20431 USA

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2006 Article IV Consultation with Chile
On August 2, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded the
Article IV consultation with Chile.1
Background
Over the past fifteen years, structural reforms and prudent economic policies have helped
anchor Chile’s successful economic performance. Since 2000, its economic strategy has been
based on a fiscal policy rule, inflation targeting with a floating exchange rate, trade liberalization,
and an open capital account, within a sound financial regulatory and supervisory framework.
These policies have provided Chile with enviably high rates of economic growth and low
inflation. During the 15–year period through 2005, growth averaged 5½ percent a year, per
capita income tripled in U. S. dollar terms, and the poverty rate was cut in half, to about
18 percent. Income inequality, however, remains high.
In recent years, Chile has continued to deepen its sound macroeconomic framework, in the
context of a surge in the world price of copper, its main export commodity. Chile’s new
administration, which assumed office in March, has reaffirmed its support for this framework.
The central bank has continued to manage monetary policy prudently, in the context of the
inflation targeting framework. Since September 2004, it has raised its policy rate by a total of
350 basis points, to 5.25 percent, in response to the economic recovery and the gradual closing
of the output gap. Consistent with the structural surplus rule and high copper price levels, the
central government registered an overall surplus of 4¾ percent of GDP in 2005, up from
2¼ percent in 2004. The ratio of Chile’s net public sector debt (including the debt of the central
bank and public enterprises) fell from about 13 percent of GDP in 2003 to 7½ percent in 2005.
1

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On
return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the
Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the
Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the
country's authorities.

2

The outlook for Chile remains positive, reflecting strong prospects for copper and robust
domestic demand. Following growth of 6.3 percent in 2005, real GDP is projected to rise by
5-6 percent in 2006, buttressed by a favorable external environment and still supportive
monetary policy. Domestic consumption growth is expected to remain buoyant, boosted by
higher incomes and employment. Consistent with the structural surplus rule, and in line with
projected copper prices, the central government would register an overall surplus of close to
6 percent of GDP in 2006. The current account surplus is projected at close to 2 percent of GDP
in 2006, reflecting high copper prices and a moderation in capital goods imports. Inflation
expectations remain well anchored and headline inflation is expected to move gradually to the
middle of the 2-4 percent target range. Despite steady employment growth, the unemployment
rate is still relatively high, at about 8 percent, as strong economic growth has encouraged more
workers to return to the labor market.
Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors commended the Chilean authorities for their continued exemplary
implementation of sound macroeconomic policies, based on strong and well-established
institutions, and reinforced by strict adherence to the structural fiscal surplus rule, a highlyregarded inflation targeting framework, increasing trade integration, and a robust financial
system. These policies have yielded substantial benefits, including low inflation, sustained
economic growth with an attendant significant reduction in poverty, and strengthened investor
confidence and resilience to external shocks.
Directors noted that the near-term outlook appears bright, with the continuing strength of
domestic consumption and exports expected to contribute to rapid economic growth, at a time
when investment is returning to more sustainable levels. The risks to the outlook appear broadly
balanced and the authorities have appropriately recognized the need to gear macroeconomic
policies toward managing the copper price boom effectively.
Directors welcomed the authorities’ strict adherence to the structural fiscal surplus rule, which
calls for a structural surplus of 1 percent of GDP in the overall balance of the central
government, and provides effective counter-cyclical support to the economy. They commended
the authorities for keeping spending growth in check, despite higher revenues associated with
the surge in copper prices. Going forward, Directors advised continued commitment to fiscal
discipline, while recognizing the priorities of the government to increase social spending in
health and education. They welcomed plans to use the copper windfalls prudently, by
accumulating resources to cover future contingent liabilities, recapitalizing the central bank, and
investing the surpluses. A few Directors suggested a faster pace of recapitalization than
currently envisaged.
Directors highlighted the success of Chile’s inflation targeting framework in anchoring inflation
expectations. They supported the gradual tightening of monetary policy under way, and
concurred that any further tightening should be largely data driven, given the difficulty of
assessing the exact timing of the closing of the output gap. Directors also noted that, if the fiscal
stance were to evolve differently than expected in 2007, the central bank should be ready to
adjust monetary policy accordingly.

3
Directors observed that the floating exchange rate regime has allowed the economy to adjust
smoothly to external shocks. The transparent policy framework, with no central bank
intervention in the foreign exchange market and supported by fiscal prudence, has helped
sustain competitiveness, as evidenced by the continued strength of nontraditional exports.
Directors noted that, going forward, continued fiscal restraint, together with the investing of the
fiscal surpluses abroad, would help limit upward pressures on the currency.
While commending the soundness of Chile’s financial sector, Directors saw room for further
efficiency improvements, while maintaining sound oversight, consistent with the
recommendations of the 2004 Financial System Stability Assessment. They encouraged the
authorities to keep the growth in consumer lending under close scrutiny and to continue
enhancing the consolidation of risk information. In this context, Directors welcomed the
authorities’ recent announcement to restart the legislative process towards early approval of the
Capital Markets II draft law. They also supported the plans to streamline financial taxation,
including the stamp tax and capital gains tax, and to reform the private pension system with a
view to extending its coverage, strengthening the social safety net, improving competition in the
sector, and liberalizing the investment regime of the pension funds. Directors welcomed the
recent revision to the AML/CFT legislation that will enhance the ability of the Financial
Intelligence Unit (FIU) to obtain information and more effectively combat money laundering.
Directors supported the authorities’ medium term emphasis on promoting sustained growth and
reducing income inequality. They welcomed reforms to improve pre-school coverage for lowincome groups, enhance funding for tertiary education, and promote research and development.
Directors also encouraged the authorities to improve labor market flexibility further in order to
increase employment opportunities and address the still high unemployment rate, especially
among the young. Progress in these areas will be key to enhancing productivity and
competitiveness and to supporting further economic diversification in the medium term.
Directors welcomed Chile’s leadership role in opening markets through comprehensive and
sustained trade and financial market liberalization. They commended the authorities for the
implementation of recent bilateral free trade agreements and for their strong commitment to
multilateral trade liberalization.

Public Information Notices (PINs) form part of the IMF's efforts to promote transparency of the IMF's
views and analysis of economic developments and policies. With the consent of the country (or countries)
concerned, PINs are issued after Executive Board discussions of Article IV consultations with member
countries, of its surveillance of developments at the regional level, of post-program monitoring, and of ex
post assessments of member countries with longer-term program engagements. PINs are also issued after
Executive Board discussions of general policy matters, unless otherwise decided by the Executive Board in
a particular case.

Statement by Javier Silva-Ruete, Alternate Executive Director for Chile
and Eduardo López-Escobedo, Senior Advisor to Executive Director
August 2, 2006

Key Points
•

Against the backdrop of the continuing favorable external environment, Chile’s GDP
and domestic demand growth are expected to be around 5 to 6 percent in 2006-07,
approximately in line or slightly above potential output growth. Although headline
inflation is at the top of the target range due to high fuel prices, core inflation
measures and expectations are well-anchored around the middle of the range over
the policy time horizon.

•

Thanks to prudent management of the copper price boom, the credibility of the
macro-financial policy framework and the favorable external outlook, the risks to
macroeconomic and financial stability are limited.

•

Chile’s new government has focused its policy agenda on ensuring conditions for
sustained growth while guaranteeing a wide network of social protection for citizens.
To meet such goals several policy initiatives have been proposed.

Our authorities would like to thank the IMF staff for another comprehensive and useful
report, and for continuing the tradition of a collaborative policy dialogue with Chile’s
authorities. We look forward to conveying the results of this Board discussion to our
authorities.
Recent Economic Developments, Outlook and Risks
1.
The external environment relevant for the Chilean economy remains very
favorable. In a context of high and more balanced growth of the global economy, copper and
oil prices have reached record-high levels during the first half of 2006. Notwithstanding the
recent correction of stock and commodity prices in the global market, Chile’s external
conditions are clearly supportive.
2.
Coherent with the transitory nature of these positive developments in terms of trade,
the current account will post a surplus this and next year. In line with this evaluation of
external conditions and following the gradual normalization of monetary policy, domestic
demand and GDP growth have moderated in the first two quarters of 2006, getting closer to
their medium-term growth path. Moreover, during the second half of the year, latest output
indicators point toward a somewhat lower increase in growth rates than what was previously
considered around the time of IMF mission to Chile. Meanwhile, wage-based employment
continues to increase relatively vigorously, but our authorities are aware that drawing strong

2
conclusions on unemployment trends, employment growth, productivity and unit labor costs
is very difficult at the time, due to methodological changes in the official labor survey
implemented during the first half of 2006. Nevertheless, Chile’s National Institute of
Statistics (INE) is working on methodologies to make the data comparable.
3.
Headline inflation is currently at the top of the target range, and the Central Bank
considers that it will converge to the center a few quarters ahead, once one-off higher fuel
prices effects fade away. Measures of core inflation ―that exclude fuels, perishables and
some regulated utilities― and of inflation expectations are well-anchored around 3 percent.
While fuel prices have continued on the rise, the rate of increase in aggregate wages has
eased in 2006, bringing about well behaved unit labor costs pressures.
4.
The external environment, coupled with Chile’s strong monetary and fiscal
fundamentals, should continue to support growth in 2006-2007. The Chilean economy is
widely expected to grow in the range of 5 to 6 percent over the next two years – roughly in
line or slightly above with the expansion in potential output. In this respect, the key risks for
the outlook of the Chilean economy remain largely external and broadly balanced, related,
on the downside, to the uncertainty in commodity prices ―specially further oil price
increases―, abrupt increases in international interest rates and its subsequent negative effects
on emerging market investors sentiment; and the uncertainty regarding the evolution of house
prices in some important industrial economies. On the upside, a more favorable development
could result from growth of the global economy and the continuation of high copper prices.
In addition to these risks, the staff also suggests that disruptions in the gas supply from
Argentina could lead to an upward adjustment of production costs, with negative
implications for domestic demand and growth. However, our authorities consider that the
extensive conversion process to alternative energy sources that has taken place, plus the
recent negotiations with Argentine authorities, ensure a moderated impact.
5.
Against the backdrop of domestic financial conditions still expansionary, our
authorities’ assessment is that the risks for the financial stability are reduced. First, Chile’s
financial system is profitable, well-capitalized with historically low levels of non performing
loans, and effectively supervised and regulated. Second, the corporate sector and households’
balance sheets are in solid position. And third, the risks of accessing to external funding are
low, since Chile’s economy has no external financing needs in 2006-07, the external debt
ratio has continued its improvement in the first half of 2006, while corporate and banking
sectors have appropriately hedged their currency risks. Moreover, the Central Bank of
Chile’s (CBC) foreign reserve adequacy ratios, together with the external assets accumulated
by the government due to high copper prices, provide an additional buffer against external
shocks.

3
Macroeconomic Policy Stance
6.
Chile’s monetary policy framework –a target of 3 percent ± 1 percent for the
inflation rate, together with a floating exchange rate– continues to serve the economy well.
The CBC has pursued a cautious and pragmatic approach by withdrawing monetary stimulus,
consistent with the goal of maintaining inflation around 3 percent over the policy horizon of
12 to 24 months. Since September 2004, the CBC has raised its policy rate by 350 basis
points to 5¼ percent. Given its view that the economy is presently operating with little or
almost no slack, the CBC considers that, in the most likely scenario, further gradual rate
hikes would likely be necessary to bring inflation closer to the target, but new policy rate
changes will be data-dependent and will probably be less frequent than in previous quarters.
The monetary policy stance is clearly understood by the private sector, as it is reflected in,
foremost, well anchored inflation expectations around 3 percent, and widespread
expectations that further gradual rate hikes lie ahead. The market remains divided on the
frequency and extent of further interest rate adjustments, with some participants arguing that
the monetary tightening cycle might be coming close to an end.
7.
Thanks to the copper price windfall and the adherence to the rule of structural
surplus, fiscal policy is expected to reach a significant increase in the surplus in 2006 to
around 6 percent of the GDP. This will allow further reduction of both the government’s
gross and net debt ratios to levels compared favorably with those of economies with similar
sovereign risk grade. The strong position of public finances provides the economy enough
flexibility to adjust quickly in the face of possible deterioration of the external environment.
As the staff has explained in their report, government authorities are mindful of the
expansive effect on spending of high cooper prices in 2007 and are committed to manage this
revenue windfall prudently. In particular, to avoid Dutch-disease like effect, the authorities
are planning to give priority in the 2007 budget to spending recomposition towards spending
outlays with high tradable content.
Government’s Structural Goals
8.
After twenty years of continued high expansion of GDP per capita averaging around
4.1 percent per year during 1991-2005 to reach about US$ 7 thousand per person, Chile has
registered significant distributive and poverty changes in the last fifteen years, which is
mainly reflected in a reduction of poverty incidence from 45 percent in 1987 to 19 percent in
2003. Nevertheless, Chile still belongs to the group of middle-income emerging economies
which face vulnerabilities from external shocks. Mindful on this reality, the new
administration has emphasized that Chile faces two challenges looking forward: ensuring
conditions for sustained growth in an increasingly flexible economy while guaranteeing a
wide network of social protection for citizens.

4
Boosting Productivity and Growth
9.
In order to maintain and to deepen Chile’s favorable economic outlook beyond for
2006-07 and reach sustained growth in the long-term, it is important to build up and
consolidate appropriate conditions for the entrepreneurship, with a special emphasis on the
development of small and medium size enterprises (SME). This will lead to more investment
and job creation while reducing social inequalities. Our authorities have taken concrete
initiatives such as a tax debt relief for SMEs reaching up to 80 percent of interest and
penalties, a gradual reduction of the stamp tax on debt reschedulings that take into account
revenue collection, the establishment of a simplified tax system for SMEs, strengthening of
the Fondo de Garantia para Pequeñas Empresas (FOGAPE) ―a government fund that
provides guarantees on bank loans to SMEs―by adding US$ 10 million to allow 46 percent
more government-guaranteed loans to this sector, the enlargement of SME base of
BancoEstado, Chile’s state-owned bank to reach 300 thousand customers by 2008, specific
measures to strengthen the liquidity position of SMEs, the development of the risk and
venture capital industry through the congressional approval of the Capital Market Reform
(MKII) package.
10.
Our authorities believe that strengthening innovation is also crucial to Chile’s longterm development. Macroeconomic stability, market-friendly FDI and trade regimes
constitute important conditions for promoting innovation. But, Chile’s innovation activities
are driven and funded by the public sector through a fragmented National Innovation System,
which result in R&D spending of only around 0.7 percent of GDP. To overcome this
drawback, our authorities intend to put in practice the recommendations of the National
Innovation Council set up during the former administration, financed with the resources from
the mining royalty which are estimated to reach US$ 150 million a year in steady state. In
that direction, the government is committed to establish a 15 percent flat tax on the software
and technology imports, and also has submitted to Congress a draft bill that establishes a 35
percent subsidy on R&D spending carried out by companies together with universities and
research centers.
11.
Chile’s performance over the past decade is due to a large extent to the strengthening
of pro-competition regulation in place. Taking further steps to promote market competition
is another important challenge to boost productivity. In this area, the initiatives to be taken
are related to strengthening the governance framework for free competition, by allocating
more resources to the Office of the National Economic Attorney and the Court of Free
Competition, setting up a new merger policy with penalties which discourage the risks of
market collusion.

5
Building a Social Safety Net
12.
The new administration is committed to developing an economic institutional
framework that assures citizens a social safety net so as to complement steadily the efforts
oriented to boost innovation and entrepreneurship. This protection framework is intended to
be built upon two pillars. First, a macroeconomic policy framework oriented to strengthen
the resilience of the economy against shocks. Second, a social policy focused on the creation
of a social safety net.
13.
Alongside the prudent management of the terms of trade boom and the reduced cost
of external financing, the monetary, exchange rate ―which includes the possibility of
interventions in exceptional circumstances― and fiscal policy framework in place
provides adequate shock absorbers that limit the economic and financial impact of a possible
abrupt reversion of external conditions, particularly over the last several years, when the
economy has been subject to a series of shocks, notably sharp increases in commodity prices
and a significant appreciation of the exchange rate, all in the context of continuing global
growth.
14.
The government is fully committed to fiscal prudence, explicitly based on a target
for the central government structural surplus of 1 percent of GDP, which has contributed in
strengthening Chile’s credibility in the international financial markets, reducing the spread at
which residents can borrow abroad, and allowing automatic stabilizers to function.
Furthermore, our authorities are committed to strengthen fiscal transparency and
accountability, reflected in the Law of Fiscal Responsibility, which is expected to be
approved by Congress during the second half of 2006. The initiative contemplates the legal
obligation for future governments to set forth the basis for their fiscal policy during the first
90 days of their administration. In addition, it includes other initiatives such as the creation of
a new Economic and Social Stabilization Fund as described in the staff report; the creation
and regulation of the Pension Reserve Fund, which will accumulate resources guaranteeing
future payments of minimum and assistance pensions due to rise as of 2016; the
establishment of rules for the management and reporting of resources from both Funds, and
the authorization for the government to make capital contributions to the Central Bank on
account of actual surplus.
15.
Building on the progress made by former administrations, the new government has
emphasized that the focus of it social policy is on both protecting citizens over their life cycle
and raising living standards. This safety net starts with childhood protection by removing
inequities at birth, enhancing the coverage and facilitating the access to childcare centers,
which may result in promoting women’s labor participation. The government has already
increased preschool education coverage for 20 thousand children by opening 800 childcare
centers. Furthermore, the recommendations of the Advisory Committee for Childhood will
be considered in the design of a new childhood protection policy, which will be brought to
Congress for its legislative discussion.

6
16.
Similar measures have been taken for the protection of the elderly, including
initiatives such as the bills approved in Congress that raised pensions for those over 65 yearsold, and guarantees gratuity in public hospitals for all citizens 60 years-old or more. Another
initiative, of a more structural nature, and on which the government has put special emphasis
on is that of the pension system reform, based on the assessment and recommendations made
by the President’s Advisory Committee. In early July the committee issued its report
covering 70 reform proposals in 11 areas, whose most important element have been
described by the staff in the supplementary note. After an analysis of the report by a
committee of ministers, the draft bill is expected to be sent to Congress late this year. The
discussion in Congress is expected to take place during 2007.
17.
Last but no least, the new government also aims at raising the population’s living
standards. Since 1991 the housing defict has been halved with the help of the construction
of almost 2 million units. In order to reduce this deficit further by 20 percent over the next
four years, the government has recently announced the establishment of a new social housing
policy, which intends to raise the standards of construction and design of governmentsupported houses, and subsidize the housing localization to avoid urban segregation. In a
complementary direction, the government plans to take a series of measures to enhance urban
security, including increased spending on the police force, and the creation of a Ministry of
Homeland Security.
Conclusion
18.
In a nutshell, these measures, in the context of a sound and responsible fiscal and
monetary policy framework in place, will allow Chile to continue its road to development, by
creating the conditions for stronger productivity growth, a key ingredient to sustained
economic growth and rising living standards.
