Staff Report for the 2010 Article IV Consultation
Prepared by the Staff Representatives for the 2010 Consultation with the
Kingdom of Swaziland
Approved by Mark Plant and Dhaneshwar Ghura
December 22, 2010
Mission. A staff team—J. Mongardini (head), A. Thomas, T. Kinda, A. Meyer-Cirkel (all
AFR), and O. Basdevant (FAD)—visited Mbabane from October 27 to November 10, 2010.
The mission met with Prime Minister B. Dlamini, Finance Minister M. Sithole, Economic
Planning and Development Minister Prince Hlangusempi, Central Bank Governor M.
Dlamini, and other senior officials. It presented the mission’s findings to the government in
a cabinet meeting on November 9, 2010. The mission was joined by representatives of the
African Development Bank (AfDB) and the World Bank (WB).
Past advice. The last Article IV consultation was concluded on February 22, 2010. In view
of Swaziland’s rapidly deteriorating fiscal position, the Fund stressed the need for urgent
fiscal consolidation along with structural reforms in key areas to help achieve fiscal
sustainability over the medium term, boost economic growth, and preserve external
stability. The authorities have responded to the advice by putting together a comprehensive
Fiscal Adjustment Roadmap.
Exchange system. Conventional peg. Swaziland maintains one exchange restriction
subject to approval under Article VIII. This arises from the 33.33 percent limit for advance
payments for the import of certain capital goods. In July 2010, the authorities removed the
overall limit on the provision of foreign exchange for advance payments for imports, thus
eliminating another exchange restriction arising from such limits.
Outreach. The mission held a seminar on November 8, 2010 on the analytical work of the
2010 Article IV Consultation, which was attended by about 100 representatives of the
government, parliament, civil society, the donor community, and the press. It also held a
joint press conference with the governor of the central bank and the permanent secretary of
the ministry of finance on November 10, 2010.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
Swaziland faces a fiscal crisis, driven by a large decline in Southern African
Customs Union (SACU) revenues and one of the largest government wage bills in
Sub-Saharan Africa. Absent corrective measures, the overall fiscal deficit is projected to
reach 16 percent of GDP. The deficit is being financed through a significant accumulation
of domestic arrears as the government runs down its deposits at the central bank. The
debt dynamic is becoming unsustainable.
The Swaziland government has responded to the crisis by adopting a Fiscal
Adjustment Roadmap (FAR) in October 2010, while taking immediate actions as
well. On the latter, the authorities increased the fuel levy in November 2010, cancelled a
large amount of investment projects, and implemented measures to reduce the wage bill.
Over the medium-term, the aims to continue to expanding revenue sources and
rationalize expenditures. On the revenue side, the authorities will shortly submit legislation
to introduce a value-added tax. On the expenditure side, they intend to introduce a civil
servants’ wage and hiring freeze for the next three years, and are implementing a
significant reduction in civil service payroll through a voluntary separation package.
Overall, the FAR is expected to reduce the fiscal deficit gradually to about 3 percent of
GDP by 2014/15. In support of the FAR, the authorities have requested financial and
technical assistance (TA) from the African Development Bank (AfDB), the European
Union (EU), the Fund, and the World Bank (WB).
The Article IV Consultation discussions focused on restoring fiscal sustainability,
improving competitiveness, and strengthening financial supervision. The authorities
and staff shared the same diagnostic on the current situation. In light of the imminent
fiscal crisis, staff advised upfront fiscal measures to eliminate domestic arrears, while
preserving pro-poor spending. The authorities preferred a more gradual approach in 2010,
but agreed that a conservative 2011/12 budget would be needed. While noting that the
FAR is a welcome step, staff suggested that it needed to be strengthened and firmly
implemented in order to successfully bring the deficit down to a sustainable level and
reduce dependence on SACU transfers. There was a broad agreement on the need to
improve competitiveness, to tackle widespread HIV/AIDS and poverty, and to preserve
financial stability by strengthening the surveillance of the financial sector.
Political and social risks are significant. During the mission, trade unions indicated
their willingness to make sacrifices, provided that these are fairly distributed across all
income groups. Protecting pro-poor spending, as well as bold actions to address the
spread of HIV/AIDS, are essential for maintaining political support for the needed fiscal
adjustment.

I. THE IMPACT OF THE GLOBAL ECONOMIC CRISIS
IN THE CONTEXT OF KEY OBSTACLES TO HIGHER GROWTH
1.
The Swaziland economy continues to underperform compared to other
SACU members, reflecting both the impact of the global economic crisis and a lack
of competitiveness. While real GDP growth is expected to have inched up to 2 percent
in 2010, the rebound is moderate and has mostly been driven by public consumption.
Swaziland also continues to underperform other SACU members, reflecting an overvalued
real effective exchange rate, continued structural impediments to growth, the relatively
high cost of doing business, and the heavy toll of HIV/AIDS on economic activity (Figure
1). The economic outlook shows only moderate growth averaging 2 percent over the
medium term. Inflation has slowed in recent months (4.5 percent in October 2010) and is
projected to remain moderate.

2.
The impact of the crisis has been felt the most in the revenue transfers of the
SACU to Swaziland. SACU imports fell by 28.1 percent in 2009 due to the contraction of
economic activity in South Africa and the unwinding of infrastructure spending associated
with the 2010 World Cup (Figure 2). As a result, transfers from the common revenue pool
to Swaziland have fallen by 11 percent of GDP in FY 2010/11 due to the highly procyclical
SACU revenue-sharing formula.1

Departmental Paper “In the Wake of the Global Economic Crisis: Adjusting to Lower Fiscal
Revenue of the South African Customs Union in Botswana, Lesotho, Namibia, and Swaziland”

The shortfall in SACU revenue and one of the highest government wage bills
in Africa have triggered a fiscal crisis, with the government incurring domestic
arrears. Absent corrective measures (see below), the deficit is expected to widen to
16 percent of GDP in 2010/11, reflecting the decline in SACU revenue and a further wage
increase granted in mid-2010 (Figure 3). This has contributed to making the Swaziland
wage bill one of the largest in Sub-Saharan Africa (Figure 4). Since the Article IV
discussion took place, the government added to fiscal pressures by passing through
parliament in November 2010 a supplementary budget of E350 million (1.3 percent of
GDP) to increase capital expenditures. The deficit has been financed through a drawdown
of government deposits at the central bank and domestic arrears on all expenditure items,
except wages and utilities.

The fiscal crisis is mirrored by a rapid deterioration of Swaziland’s external
position. The recent deterioration in the current account is mainly the result of weak
export growth, higher import growth, and a sharp reduction in SACU revenues. The
current account deficit is expected to have widened to 20.5 percent of GDP in 2010,
reflecting the decline in SACU transfers and unabated public consumption. Foreign direct
investment and other financial flows remain anemic. As a result, gross official reserves
declined steadily in 2009-10, as the government drew down its deposits at the central
bank (Figure 5).

Swaziland also suffers from an overvalued exchange rate and impediments
to private sector development. Staff estimates suggest that the overvaluation of the real
effective exchange rate (REER) increased to a range of 16-25 percent at end-2009 and
further rose in the course of 2010 (Appendix I and Figure 6). Given the peg of the
1
Lilangeni to the South African rand, the main factor behind the overvaluation lies in the
public sector wage policy, which has granted consistent increases over the years, while
productivity improvements remained uncertain. Moreover, despite comparative
advantages in some export-oriented sectors (e.g., sugar, cassava, fruit juices), the private
sector is still in dire need of further development, being held back by the high cost of doing
business, as assessed by the World Bank. Given the projected fiscal imbalances, the
recent appreciation of the South African rand vis-à-vis the US dollar and the need for
structural reforms geared toward a private-sector-led growth, external stability could be
jeopardized without an adjustment in policies.

Swaziland removed one of the existing exchange restrictions subject to
approval under Article VIII. Swaziland maintained two restrictions subject to approval
under Article VIII. These arose from overall limits on the provision of foreign exchange for
advance payments for imports as an absolute amount (E 250,000) and a 33.33 percent
limit for the import of certain capital goods. In July 2010, the authorities amended the
Exchange Control Rulings so as to remove the overall limits on the provision of foreign

exchange for advance payments for imports, and issued a Circular to inform the public of
the amendment. The authorities’ actions eliminated the exchange restriction arising from
such limits. The exchange restriction arising from the 33.33 percent limit on the provision
of foreign exchange for advance payments for the import of certain capital goods still
remains in place.
7.
The prevalence of HIV/AIDS strains human capital and substantially reduces
potential output. Swaziland remains the most affected country by HIV/AIDS in the world.
By lowering life expectancy at birth to 31 years and increasing absenteeism due to
sickness, HIV/AIDS deters human capital accumulation and reduces productivity growth
(Appendix II). It also poses constrains on growth in labor intensive sectors, such as textile
and agriculture, while placing a burden on household and public finances.2
II. THE AUTHORITIES’ POLICY RESPONSE
8.
The government adopted immediate measures to reduce the deficit for
2010/11. In November 2010, the fuel levy was raised by E25 per liter to align end-user
prices to those in South Africa, with an additional increase planned for April 2011.
Investment projects that have not been initiated yet were postponed to 2011/12, which
would represent savings of about E 300 million (about 1 percent of GDP). However, the
proposed cuts include pro-poor projects. Additionally, measures were taken to contain the
wage bill, with cuts in over-time work, a freeze in new hires, and improved control of the
number of civil servants by reducing ghost workers.
9.
The Fiscal Adjustment Roadmap (FAR), adopted in October 2010, would
build on these measures and bring the deficit down to sustainable levels over the
medium term. On the revenue side, the FAR envisages:

Introducing a VAT and a capital gains tax. The value added tax (VAT) is
expected to replace the general sales tax starting with the 2012/13 budget.

The revenue administration will also be strengthened so as to fight tax
evasion more effectively. The Swaziland Revenue Authority (SRA) is now expected to
be operational from January 2011. Furthermore, a creation of a large taxpayer unit is
planned, as well as the simplification of the tax structure.
On the expenditure side, the FAR includes a:

A freeze on the wage bill for the next three years. This would be achieved
through: i) freezing vacancies and reallocating resources more efficiently; ii) reducing the
overall size of the public service by 20 percent, by implementing an early retirement exit
scheme, outsourcing services, and the creation of autonomous agencies (e.g. Civil

Aviation, Central Transportation Administration); and iii) reviewing compensation policy
and introducing performance management systems.

Cuts in expenditures on goods and services. The FAR envisages stricter
controls and greater efficiencies in the delivery of goods and services, as well as PFM
reforms to improve procurement, accounting, and auditing practices. In particular, the
Central Transportation Administration will be turned into a full public enterprise subject to
audited annual statements by end-March 2011. Most other public enterprises are
generally well-run and profitable (Box 1).

Box 1: The Performance of Public Enterprises in Swaziland
Swaziland currently has 32 active public enterprises. These enterprises cover a broad
range of activities, including agriculture, transportation, finance, utilities, services, education,
housing, and health. About 40 percent of the public enterprises are non-profit entities and
rely heavily on government subsidies for their activity. The remainder are profit-seeking
public enterprises, which have recorded operating surpluses for the last three fiscal years,
thus not posing significant fiscal risks. The government is required to report quarterly to
parliament on their performance.

10.
If the FAR is successfully implemented, government debt should remain
sustainable over the medium term. Based on the debt sustainability analysis for middleincome countries, the debt to GDP ratio should peak below 40 percent in 2014/15 and
start coming down thereafter. Debt service projections show interest payments gradually
doubling to 1.5 percent of GDP by 2014/15.
11.
Monetary easing continues in line with the policy of the South African
Reserve Bank. The Central Bank of Swaziland (CBS) eliminated the differential in policy
rates with South Africa in March 2010 and continues to follow the South African monetary
policy, including with the latest interest rate reduction in November 2010 (Figure 7).

III. POLICY DISCUSSIONS
12.
The main challenges facing the Swaziland economy are: a) restoring fiscal
sustainability, b) improving competitiveness, and, c) strengthening financial
supervision.
A. Restoring Fiscal Sustainability
13.
The current fiscal position is unsustainable. Under unchanged policies, the
debt to GDP ratio would rise rapidly to unsustainable levels over the medium term (Figure
8). In the short run, the spread of domestic arrears to the wage bill would have dire
consequences for the rest of the economy, including the banking system. For example the
exposure of banks and non-bank financial institutions (NBFIs) to the civil service could
lead to a rapid increase in their non-performing loan should no action be taken to reduce
domestic arrears. As the government continues to draw down its deposits at the central
bank, the gross official reserves of the central bank will be further depleted, calling into
question external stability.
Staff’s views: The fiscal crisis requires additional upfront measures and
comprehensive medium-term fiscal reforms.

14.
The current fiscal crisis necessitates upfront measures to eliminate
domestic arrears, while preserving pro-poor spending. This requires mobilizing
significant additional bond financing over the next few months, and taking the necessary
revenue and expenditure measures to bring the fiscal deficit down in line with available
financing. In particular, a reversal of the wage increase granted in 2010 would make
significant headway in reducing the large wage bill. Additional savings could be achieved
by cutting nonpriority capital spending, while safeguarding education and health
expenditure. In this context, it was unfortunate that the authorities moved forward with a
supplementary budget on a nonpriority capital project in the midst of a fiscal crisis. On an
institutional front, the Policy and Budgeting Committee, which has led to a segmentation
of the budget process and expenditure authorization amongst three ministries, could be
eliminated and all budgetary functions centered in the minister of finance. Budget
reporting also needed to be beefed up for line ministries to report expenditure on a cash
and commitment basis, as well as outstanding arrears.

14
15.
Additional revenue and expenditure measures are needed in the 2011/12
budget to ensure that the fiscal deficit is reduced to a sustainable path.3 In
particular, the hiring and wage freeze needs to be maintained, while the civil service
payroll is reduced by applicants to the Enhanced Voluntary Early Retirement Scheme
(EVERS) adopted by the authorities in November 2010. In addition, any unforeseen
SACU revenue should be saved in order to make further progress towards fiscal
consolidation, while reducing fiscal vulnerabilities and restoring a sufficient level of gross
official reserves. Inevitably, real GDP growth will suffer in 2011 (0.5 percent) as a result of
the fiscal adjustment, but it is expected to recover to its potential rate of 2.5 percent over
the medium term, as improvements in the business climate will lead the private sector to
pick up the lower public demand.
16.
The main medium-term objective should be to bring the deficit down to a
sustainable level and to reduce the dependence on SACU transfers in line with the
FAR (Figure 8). For Swaziland, the guiding principle of the adjustment effort was to
stabilize the debt to GDP ratio below 40 percent of GDP, while maintaining a sufficient
level of gross official reserves to maintain external stability. The optimal fiscal adjustment
path that derives from this principle was a reduction in the overall fiscal deficit gradually to
about 3 percent of GDP by 2014/15. Relying on recurrent expenditure cuts, with particular
emphasis on the wage bill, would be the most credible way to achieve fiscal consolidation,
while mitigating the impact on growth. At the same time, it will be important to protect
education and health expenditures so as to improve the composition and quality of
spending.
17.
The credibility of the medium-term fiscal adjustment would be strengthened
by further improvements in the budget process. The government could spell out its
policies within a three-year budget framework, which could be anchored on debt and fiscal
sustainability, while developing a medium-term vision on spending priorities and resource
allocation between line ministries. Budget reporting and transparency need to be
strengthened in line with prevailing standards in the SACU region to allow for appropriate
oversight by parliament.
Authorities’ views: While in agreement with staff views, the authorities have not yet
been in a position to implement all the required measures
18.
Some policy recommendations have not been fully implemented, because
the authorities are worried about their potential adverse impact on social peace.
They indicated in particular that a reversal in the wage increase granted in the first half of
2010 could cause social upheaval. They instead opted for cuts in overtime pay, a freeze in
new hires, and the reduction of ghost workers. They also saw more limited scope for
containing capital spending, arguing in particular that the supplementary budget was

3

The projections for SACU revenue have been revised in line with the decision of the SACU
Council of Ministers in December 2009 on the amounts of SACU transfers for fiscal year 2011/12:
Swaziland will receive about E2.9 billion (9.8 percent of GDP).

15
essential in order to avoid large penalties if the ongoing capital project is stopped.
Furthermore, against staff advice, cuts were proposed on pro-poor spending projects.
19.
The authorities shared the staff’s views on the need for a conservative
2011/12 budget. They pointed to the establishment of the SRA and the full-year impact of
the measures already being taken, including the voluntary separations, as being a good
basis to reduce significantly the 2011/12 fiscal deficit. They also agreed to the objective of
reducing the fiscal deficit to single digits in percent of GDP over the medium term—
consistent with stabilizing the debt at about 40 percent of GDP—and were ready to take
additional measures if needed. They also saw passage of the Public Financial
Management Bill in early 2011 as critical to improve expenditure management.
20.
Weaknesses in administrative capacity also hamper the implementation of
fiscal measures. The authorities have therefore requested TA from the Fund on revenue
administration and expenditure management and control. They were also considering a
request for an update of the Debt Management Performance Assessment done by the WB
in 2008, and requested technical assistance on budget reporting from the EU.
B. Improving Competitiveness
21.
Beyond fiscal adjustment, the main challenge for Swaziland remains to
improve competitiveness to enhance potential growth. In the context of the Common
Monetary Area (CMA) and an overvalued REER, fiscal policy is the main instrument to
bring about a relative wage reduction compared with partner countries, while improving
productivity and reducing the cost of doing business. This should, over time, bring about
the necessary real exchange rate adjustment to allow Swaziland to grow at its full
potential.
Staff’s views: The authorities need to create the business environment for private
sector-led growth.
22.
Improving competitiveness would require enhancing the business climate. In
this regard, the long-term decline in FDI is a clear indication that Swaziland is becoming a
less attractive place for doing business in the region. Firm actions need to be taken to
reduce the cost of enforcing contracts, reduce red tape and corruption, and make
progress towards regional economic integration, which could be beneficial to smaller
countries like Swaziland.
23.
Bold steps are needed to liberalize markets and restart the privatization
program. As an example, per minute mobile phone calls in Swaziland are four times
higher than in neighboring South Africa, reflecting the current monopoly enjoyed by the
local operator. Opening up the mobile telecommunication sector would reduce the cost of
doing business, while raising considerable additional resources to the budget.
Furthermore, publicly-owned enterprises operating in competitive markets could also be
considered for privatization, including Swazi Bank.
Authorities’ views: Actions have already been taken and are underway to
strengthen the role of the private sector.

16
24.
The authorities are taking action to respond to the deterioration in
competitiveness. They agreed on the estimates of the overvaluation of REER and
believed that a wage and hiring freeze will be sufficient over the medium term to bring
about the necessary relative wage reduction needed to restore competitiveness. They
also pointed to the REER overvaluation in South Africa as an indication that the problem
is at the level of the CMA, not just Swaziland. The Companies Act, promulgated in June
2010, would strengthen investor protection while the processes of company registration
and issuing of licenses had been improved markedly.
25.
The government planned to launch the tender of a second mobile phone
license by March 2011. It was also considering restarting its 2004 privatization program,
with a view to making progress in attracting additional FDI to Swaziland. This would
include the privatization of Swazi Bank, where the authorities were considering requesting
technical assistance from development partners.
C. Strengthening Financial Supervision
26.
The financial sector has weathered the global crisis well but some
vulnerabilities remain in the NBFIs. Banks are well capitalized, profitable, and liquid
(Table 6). However, several NBFIs have recently emerged as they attempt to take
advantage of the liquidity surge from the mandatory repatriation of 30 percent of pension
funds and insurance companies’ assets held abroad. Some of the pension funds and
insurance companies have started to venture into areas where they might not have
expertise, such as granting loans to the private sector. The government passed the
Financial Services Regulatory Authority Bill in early 2010 to help address weaknesses in
the supervision of NBFIs including pension funds, but the legislation has not yet been
implemented.
Staff’s views: Strengthening the surveillance of the financial system is essential
during the crisis.
27.
In order to preserve financial sector stability, the authorities should remain
vigilant on the spillover effects the fiscal crisis may have on asset quality. In
particular, several banks were highly exposed, directly or indirectly, to the government and
civil service, and any further increase in domestic arrears could lead to a significant jump
in nonperforming loans. The authorities were urged also to act swiftly to recapitalize one
insurance company. Staff cautioned against continued involvement of pension funds and
insurance companies in noncore activities, as this could jeopardize their long–term
financial viability, and could potentially lead to contingent liabilities for the budget.
Authorities’ views: The NBFIs will shortly be appropriately supervised.
28.
The authorities recognized the importance of monitoring the financial sector
portfolio closely. They stood ready to act swiftly with prompt corrective actions if and
when the quality of the loan portfolio deteriorated. On the supervision of the NBFIs, the
authorities were looking into the recapitalization needs of one of the insurance companies.
They planned to implement shortly the Financial Services Regulatory Authority. This
should address the lack of oversight of noncore activities of pension funds and insurance

17
companies. A separate Securities Bill, currently with parliament, provides guidelines to
improve the regulatory framework of the stock market and is projected to boost private
sector investment by increasing the number of available investment instruments.
IV. DISCUSSIONS ON A STAFF-MONITORED PROGRAM AND RISKS
29.
During his visit to Washington, DC in early October, the prime minster
requested Fund staff to monitor the implementation of the authorities’ program
through a Staff-Monitored Program (SMP). An SMP is appropriate at this stage to build
a track record towards a formal Fund arrangement and to strengthen budget reporting and
expenditure management. Broad understandings were reached on the main elements of
an SMP in line with the recommendations emanating from the Article IV policy
discussions. However, the lack of implementation on a number of urgent measures and
the passage of a supplementary budget precluded the conclusion of the discussions.
Further discussions are expected to take place in the context of a staff visit in early 2011.
30.
Mitigating the potential social implication of the fiscal adjustment will require
protecting pro-poor spending and improved transparency, so as to create a climate
more favorable to a broad political and social consensus on reforms. Specifically,
social cohesion will be essential around difficult economic measures, including the cuts in
the wage bill. Trade unions indicated their willingness to staff to make sacrifices, provided
that these are fairly distributed across all income groups. Protecting pro-poor spending, as
well as bold actions to address the spread of HIV/AIDS, are also essential for maintaining
political support for fiscal adjustment. In addition, political support for the reform agenda
remains untested, including by the highest authorities.
V. STAFF APPRAISAL
31.
The Swaziland economy is at a crossroad. The sharp decline of SACU revenue
this year and the steady ratcheting up of the wage bill over the last decade have led to a
fiscal crisis. The treasury balances have been depleted, the gross international reserves
have fallen dramatically, and the government is starting to accumulate large domestic
arrears on all expenditure items, except wages and utilities. Continuing on the same trend
will lead to higher domestic arrears, including on civil service wages, a spreading of the
crisis to the financial sector, and possibly social upheaval. The alternative of going
through a painful but necessary fiscal adjustment could potentially avoid such dire
consequences.
32.
Greater focus on front-loaded revenue and expenditure measures is required
given the immediacy of the crisis. In this regard, it is unfortunate that the authorities
adopted a supplementary budget to increase nonpriority spending at a time when the
government is having difficulty financing itself. Bolder actions such as a nominal wage cut
and/or additional cuts in nonpriority spending could be considered.
33.
The fiscal adjustment effort will need to be continued through a conservative
budget for 2011/12. Additional measures will be needed to reduce the budget deficit
below 10 percent of GDP. In this context, the authorities are encouraged to consider
reversing the wage increase given in 2010 as a way to reduce the wage bill and mitigate

18
the impact of the adjustment on growth. It will also be essential to protect education and
health spending in order to continue the fight against poverty and HIV/AIDS. Finally, the
tender of the second mobile license and the privatization of public enterprises, including
Swazi Bank, could bring significant FDI and reduce the large financing gap.
34.
The authorities’ FAR is a welcome step, but needs to be strengthened and
firmly implemented. On the revenue front, the introduction of a VAT would be a welcome
step, but technical improvements are necessary to ensure successful implementation. On
the expenditure front, a more ambitious and comprehensive civil service reform is needed
to tackle the unsustainably large wage bill and to enhance competitiveness. Finally, the
budget elaboration, execution, and control should all be significantly improved. In
particular, the Policy and Budgeting Committee could be abolished and all budgetary
functions centered in the minister of finance. The strengthening of the budget process also
requires enhanced expenditure management, and greater monitoring and transparency in
fiscal reporting. In this context, technical assistance from the donor community will be
critical to strengthen the administrative capacity of the ministry of finance.
35.
Beyond the fiscal adjustment, the challenge to improve competitiveness is
daunting. Decisive action is needed to address the heavy human toll from the HIV/AIDS
epidemic, which also underscores the need to redouble efforts to make Swaziland an
attractive place for doing business. Critical measures in these areas are the
disengagement of government from key sectors of the economy and a systemic effort to
reduce the cost of doing business. A reduction in relative waqes would also help address
the overvaluation of the real exchange rate. With these measures, the historical decline in
FDI could be reversed, and potential output increased.
36.
While the banking system seems currently in good health, NBFIs require
effective supervision, stronger regulation, and higher capital for one insurance
company. The promulgation of the Financial Services Regulatory Authority Bill is a step in
the right direction, but needs to be followed by swift implementation. The authorities
should also remain vigilant on the health of the banking system, given that the fiscal crisis
could quickly affect the quality of the banks’ loan portfolio.
37.
It is recommended that the Kingdom of Swaziland remains on the standard
12-month Article IV Consultation cycle.

1/ Derived as [r - g -  (1+g) +  (1+r)]/(1+g+ +g ) times previous period debt stock, with r = nominal effective interest rate on external debt; = change in domestic GDP deflator in US dollar terms, g = real GDP growth rate,
 = nominal appreciation (increase in dollar value of domestic currency), and  = share of domestic-currency denominated debt in total external debt.
2/ The contribution from price and exchange rate changes is defined as [-(1+g  (1+r1+g+ +g ) times previous period debt stock. increases with an appreciating domestic currency (> 0) and rising inflation (based on GDP deflator).
3/ For projection, line includes the impact of price and exchange rate changes.
4/ Defined as current account deficit, plus amortization on medium- and long-term debt, plus short-term debt at end of previous period.
5/ The key variables include real GDP growth; nominal interest rate; dollar deflator growth; and both non-interest current account and non-debt inflows in percent of GDP.
6/ Long-run, constant balance that stabilizes the debt ratio assuming that key variables (real GDP growth, nominal interest rate, dollar deflator growth, and non-debt inflows in percent of GDP) remain at their levels
of the last projection year.

1/ Indicate coverage of public sector, e.g., general government or nonfinancial public sector. Also whether net or gross debt is used.
2/ Derived as [(r - (1+g - g + (1+r]/(1+g++g)) times previous period debt ratio, with r = interest rate;  = growth rate of GDP deflator; g = real GDP growth rate;  = share of foreign-currency
denominated debt; and  = nominal exchange rate depreciation (measured by increase in local currency value of U.S. dollar).
3/ The real interest rate contribution is derived from the denominator in footnote 2/ as r - π (1+g) and the real growth contribution as -g.
4/ The exchange rate contribution is derived from the numerator in footnote 2/ as (1+r).
5/ For projections, this line includes exchange rate changes.
6/ Defined as public sector deficit, plus amortization of medium and long-term public sector debt, plus short-term debt at end of previous period.
7/ The key variables include real GDP growth; real interest rate; and primary balance in percent of GDP.
8/ Derived as nominal interest expenditure divided by previous period debt stock.
9/ Assumes that key variables (real GDP growth, real interest rate, and other identified debt-creating flows) remain at the level of the last projection year.

Appendix I. Exchange Rate Assessment1
1.
Swaziland is a member of the CMA together with Lesotho, Namibia, and
South Africa. The Swaziland lilangeni is pegged at par with the South African rand, which
is also legal tender. In this context of a currency union, the assessment of the exchange
rate level provides an indication of whether domestic policies are in line with external
stability.
2.
The three standard approaches used by Fund staff to assess the level of the
exchange rate are the equilibrium exchange rate approach, the macro balance
approach and the external sustainability approach:2
 The equilibrium exchange rate approach is based on a panel regression of real
exchange rate determinants for 182 countries and using Africa specific coefficients. 3 It
finds that the real effective exchange rate (REER) for Swaziland was 9 percent
overvalued in 2008 using this approach. Since then, the real exchange rate has
appreciated by 15 percent while the major determinants of the equilibrium rate (terms
of trade, relative productivities) have stayed fairly stable. This suggests that the real
effective exchange rate is currently overvalued by about 20-25 percent through
September 2010.
 In terms of the macro-balance approach, the calculated current account norm for
Swaziland based on variables included in the original CGER panel study is between
zero and a 2 percent deficit using variable estimates for 2014 when a sustainable
fiscal position is assumed to be in place (Aydin (2010)). This compares with a medium
term current account deficit projected at about 10 percent of GDP. These figures are
comparable to the estimates used in the 2009 Article IV consultation. Based on this
norm and real exchange rate elasticity with respect to the current account of -0.4, the
REER would need to depreciate by almost 18 percent to eliminate the disparity
between the current account norm and the medium term current account forecast.
 The third approach based on external sustainability identifies the exchange rate
change required to maintain the appropriate stock of net foreign assets (NFA) to GDP.
An alternative metric is to use the external debt ratio at which the reserve coverage in
terms of base money is at an acceptable level. Currently, gross official reserves cover
five times base money but this coverage is projected to dwindle rapidly over time as
the government draws down its deposits to finance the fiscal deficit. To square the
circle, a combination of real exchange rate depreciation through relative wage

adjustments and a higher share of borrowing in South African rand are needed to
maintain reserve cover at the desired level of fully backing base money. For example,
a combination of a 16 percent relative wage reduction and an increase in the share of
foreign borrowing (e.g. US$100 million per annum) to finance the fiscal deficit would
maintain the reserve coverage above the level of base money, and stabilize the
external debt ratio at slightly below 30 percent of GDP. Recent developments in
relative wages show that Swaziland’s average wage level in dollar terms has grown
slightly less than some of its neighboring countries. With the authorities’ intention of
maintaining a wage freeze over the next three years, this trend is likely to continue.
Indeed, the combination of a wage freeze in Swaziland with wages in neighboring
countries rising by 5 percent per annum over this period could contribute to improving
the reserves position significantly.

3.
All three exchange rate assessments suggest that the Swaziland currency is
overvalued in the range of 16-25 percent. In order to eliminate the overvaluation, a
significant fiscal and relative wage adjustment is needed over the medium term to reduce
domestic absorption, bring the real exchange rate to a competitive level and preserve
external stability. The real exchange rate of South Africa is also estimated to be
overvalued by 5-15 percent. Some of the needed real exchange rate adjustment may
therefore take place through nominal adjustments in South Africa’s exchange rate.

There is also significant progress that Swaziland needs to make to improve
its nonprice competitiveness. .According to the World Bank Doing business database,
Swaziland scores as in the lowest 3 percentile of countries in the world in the category of
protecting investors (Figure 2). In addition, there is significant room for improvement also
in the category of trading across borders, registering property, starting a business, and
enforcing contracts. The Swaziland authorities are aware of these shortcomings and are
working to address these issues, including by passing the new Companies Act.

Appendix II. Background Note On Analyzing Swaziland’s Economic Performance8
1.
In the past two decades Swaziland has seen a gradual decrease in its output
growth. For most of the three

had an impressive growth rate

averaging 6 percent. However, at

delivering an average growth rate of
just 3.7 percent, falling short of the

neighboring countries (Botswana,
Lesotho, Namibia, and South
50
Africa). The turn of the millennia
brought about a further slowdown in

1964 1968 1972 1976 1980 1984 1988 1992 1996 2000 2004 2008
growth, averaging only 2.3 percent
in the period 2000–09.
2.
An important determinant of the slowdown in growth in the 1990s and 2000s has
been lower investment, and a shift away from private investment-led growth. Total
investment accounted for 15.9 percent of GDP in 2009, similar to the level in 2000. However,
from 2000 to 2009, public investment in percent of GDP rose from 5.7 percent to 10.4 percent,
while at the same time private investment rate declined from 12.6 to 5.5 percent of GDP. The
declining share of private investment resulted from the loss of attractiveness of Swaziland as a
destination for investment, the end of some preferential trade agreements, and fierce
competition from other textile producers.
3.
Major negative Total Factor Productivity (TFP) shocks started in the late 1980s
and continued into the 1990s – driven by the rapid spread of HIV/AIDS. A key ingredient in
explaining productivity in Swaziland is the development in human capital. The two main
components to human capital are education and health. Health, of course, affects human capital
directly as it is the foundation for a productive labor force, and indirectly, because without a
minimum level of it, no acquired education could be applied effectively. The rapid spread of
HIV/AIDS has undermined human capital in Swaziland, which remained in 2007 the most
affected country in the world according to the United Nations. By lowering life expectancy, and
increasing absenteeism due to sickness, HIV/AIDS deters human capital accumulation and
reduces productivity growth. High HIV/AIDS also poses constrains on growth in labor intensive
sectors, such as textile and agriculture, while placing a burden on household and public
finances. Its impact on growth can be relatively large; a study from the International Labor

8

Prepared by Roland Kpodar and Alexis Meyer-Cirkel and presented during the outreach seminar on
November 8, 2010 in Mbabane.

41

Organization estimates that HIV/AIDS reduced per capita GDP growth in Swaziland on average
by 1.8 percentage points each year from 1992 through 2002.
4.
Economic development in Swaziland has furthermore been hampered by a loss of
international competitiveness, as measured by the Doing Business indicators or the real
effective exchange rate. A bottleneck for the local industry seems to be the disproportionate
amount of red tape. Swazi authorities request in excess of 15 percent more documents prior to
export than the SSA average, and twice as many documents prior to export than the Euro Area.
On the time required to enforce a contract the picture is even worse. The World Bank Doing
Business database also shows that over time various indicators have been stagnant for
Swaziland, while they have improved in the majority of other countries presented above. This
means that the Swazi competitiveness has been deteriorating compared to other regions of the
world. A comparison of the real effective exchange rate of Swaziland and South Africa provides
an additional measure of competitiveness. This index particularly reflects price developments in
local markets and thereby indicates what the production cost dynamics might look like. While
the Lilangeni has been pegged to the South African Rand, the Swazi currency has been
appreciating in real terms against the Rand, especially in the second half of the last decade,
suggesting a loss of competitiveness against South African producers. At the same time,
Swaziland has been losing labor productivity, which has likely compounded the loss of
competitiveness.
5.
Likely increase in resource misallocation due to the government’s broader
participation in the economic process. The size of the public sector in the economy may be a
deterrent to private sector activity. The Swazi government participates in the economy in a wide
range of areas (transportation and telecommunication being prominent ones) and often in a
proportion, which theoretical and empirical studies would suggest are detrimental to a healthy
and sustainable long term growth and development path. Government consumption as a
percentage of GDP is relatively high in Swaziland, when compared to its peer group, or when
compared to the fast growing Asian region. In addition, expenditure allocation within the budget
is highly concentrated on public wages. The total cost of civil service accounts for a substantial
portion of overall government spending. In 2010 the cost of the civil service wage bill added up
to 17.8 percent of GDP, which is more than half of the overall expenditure. Budget expenses on
the wage bill are much higher in Swaziland than in many parts of the world.

The lilangeni (plural: emalangeni) is pegged at parity to the South African rand, which—
alongside the lilangeni—is also legal tender. The intervention currency is the U.S. dollar;
exchange rates for the U.S. dollar are based on the floating middle rate of the South African
rand against the U.S. dollar. The rate on December 31, 2009 was E1 = US$0.13981. Swaziland
maintains an exchange restriction subject to approval under Article VIII arising from a 33.33
percent limit for advance payments for the import of certain capital goods.

III. SWAZILAND: STATISTICAL ISSUES APPENDIX
(As of December 16, 2010)
I. Assessment of Data Adequacy for Surveillance
General: Data provision has some shortcomings, but is broadly adequate for surveillance. Staff’s
analysis was affected by shortcomings in certain areas, including the national accounts and the external
sector. The authorities provide available data to the Fund with a lag of one to three months, except for
the national accounts, international trade data and the international investment position, which are
reported irregularly.
Real sector statistics: STA GDDS missions have resulted in significant improvements in the national
accounts. Current and constant price (base = 2000) GDP estimates are now available from both the
production and expenditure approaches. These new estimates have not yet been published, as there
are still some shortcomings concerning the treatment of Southern African Customs Union revenue. The
authorities are planning the first labor force survey with support from the World Bank/GDDS project.
The consumer price index was significantly revised in May 2007 in the context of the GDDS initiative,
incorporating improvements in compilation methodology, market basket coverage, flexibility for
introducing new pricing outlets and new varieties of products, and enhanced processing capabilities.
Four new geographical indices, as well as a national index, with updated market basket weights, are
now available. Monthly consumer price data are published by the Central Statistical Office (CSO) with a
one-month lag.
Monetary and financial statistics: Although some progress was achieved in the reporting of data on
the other depository corporations (ODCs), quality problems remained, particularly in the areas of
classification and sectorization. The majority of the ODCs reported various degrees of difficulty in
providing accurate data to the Central Bank of Swaziland (CBS). Furthermore, the institutional coverage
of the depository corporations’ survey is limited, as it covers only the CBS and the commercial banks.
Recently the CBS has started to include the Swaziland Building Society into the monetary data
backdated to December 2006. The credit and savings cooperatives, representing about 8 percent of the
deposits of the commercial banks, are still outside the deposit corporations’ survey.
External sector statistics: Annual balance of payments statistics are compiled by the CBS according to
a methodology consistent with the fifth edition of the Balance of Payments Manual (BPM5). However,
shortcomings in the timeliness and availability of trade data impart a certain degree of uncertainty to
external sector statistics and surveillance. The CSO publishes data on foreign trade on a quarterly basis,
but the lack of sufficient computer resources results in long lags in the production of trade data,
especially regarding imports. Further actions are required to improve the accuracy and reliability of
external sector data.
II. Data Standards and Quality
Participant in the General Data Dissemination
System (GDDS) since February 11, 2003.

No data ROSC is available.

III. Reporting to STA
The CBS reports monetary and financial statistics to STA regularly, although the timeliness of data could
be improved. Balance of payments and international investment position data are published in
International Financial Statistics (IFS) and in the Balance of Payments Yearbook.

Public Information Notice (PIN) No. 11/6
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
January 12, 2011

International Monetary Fund
700 19th Street, NW
Washington, D. C. 20431 USA

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2010 Article IV Consultation with
Swaziland
On January 10, 2011, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded
the Article IV consultation with Swaziland.1
Background
The Swaziland economy continues to underperform, reflecting both the impact of the global
economic crisis and key obstacles to growth. While real GDP growth is expected to have inched up
to 2 percent in 2010, the rebound is moderate and has mostly been driven by public consumption.
Swaziland also continues to underperform other SACU members, reflecting an overvalued
exchange rate, continued structural impediments to growth, and the heavy toll of HIV/AIDS on
economic activity. The economic outlook shows only moderate growth averaging 2 percent over the
medium term. Inflation has slowed in recent months (4.5 percent in October 2010) and is projected
to remain moderate over the medium term.
The impact of the crisis has been felt the most in the revenue transfers of the Southern African
Customs Union (SACU) to Swaziland. SACU imports fell sharply in 2009 due to the contraction of
economic activity in South Africa and the unwinding of infrastructure spending associated with the
2010 World Cup. As a result, transfers from the common revenue pool to Swaziland have fallen by
11 percent of GDP in FY 2010/11 due to the highly procyclical SACU revenue-sharing formula.
1

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On
return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the
Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the
Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the
country's authorities.

2
The shortfall in SACU revenue and a high wage bill are engendering a fiscal crisis. Absent corrective
measures, the deficit could widen to 16 percent of GDP in 2010/11, reflecting the decline in SACU
revenue and a further wage increase granted in mid-2010. This has contributed to making the
Swaziland wage bill one of the largest in Sub-Saharan Africa. The government also added to fiscal
pressures by submitting a supplementary budget to parliament in November 2010 to clear capital
expenditure arrears. The deficit has been financed through a drawdown of government deposits at
the central bank and domestic arrears on all expenditure items, except wages and utilities.
The fiscal crisis is mirrored by a rapid deterioration of Swaziland’s external position. The current
account deficit is expected to have widened to 20.5 percent of GDP in 2010, reflecting the decline in
SACU transfers and unabated public consumption. Foreign direct investment and other financial
flows remain anemic. As a result, gross official reserves declined steadily in 2009-10, as the
government drew down its deposits at the central bank.
The government adopted a Fiscal Adjustment Roadmap (FAR) in October 2010 to correct the
unsustainable fiscal position. On the revenue side, the FAR envisages increases in taxes and the
introduction of the value added tax and a capital gains tax. On the expenditure side, the FAR
includes a freeze on the wage bill for the next three years and cuts in expenditures on goods and
services. It also envisages stricter controls and greater efficiencies in the delivery of goods and
services, as well as PFM reforms to improve procurement, accounting, and auditing practices. In
November 2010, the authorities increased the fuel levy, canceled a large amount of investment
projects, and implemented measures to reduce the wage bill.

Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors agreed with the thrust of the staff appraisal. They noted that a sharp decline in
revenue transfers from the Southern African Customs Union (SACU) and excessive growth in the
public sector wage bill have set the stage for a fiscal crisis which threatens external stability and the
soundness of the financial sector. The immediate policy challenges are to restore a sustainable
fiscal position, regain competitiveness, and strengthen financial sector supervision. Directors
welcomed the authorities’ plans on all these fronts, but emphasized the need for more ambitious and
sustained efforts to revitalize Swaziland’s economic performance.
Directors called for additional measures in the 2011/12 budget to compensate for recent increases
in non-priority spending and continued weakness in SACU revenue transfers. They stressed the
importance of reining in the public sector wage bill while protecting needed social programs. Noting
the large financing gap for the 2011/12 fiscal year, they encouraged the authorities to mobilize
additional domestic financing, while seeking financial assistance from the international community.
Underscoring that fiscal consolidation needs to be sustained over the medium term, Directors
welcomed the authorities’ intention to reduce the budget deficit to 2 percent of GDP by 2014/15.
However, they considered that achieving this target requires bolder fiscal adjustment and budgetary
reforms than envisaged in the current plan. Additional technical assistance is also necessary to build
up implementation capacity, particularly at the ministry of finance.

3

Taking note of the staff’s assessment that the real effective exchange rate remains overvalued,
Directors expressed concern about the erosion of competitiveness which depresses growth and
inhibits private sector development. They called for stepped up efforts to improve the business
environment, including by reviving the government’s privatization program, reducing the cost of
doing business, and keeping labor costs in line with those in the region.
Directors noted that the banking system remains in good health but saw a need to strengthen the
oversight of nonbank financial institutions which appear to have broadened their activities to noncore areas. More broadly, they encouraged the authorities to remain vigilant, given the risks posed
to the financial sector by the fragile fiscal situation.
It is expected that the next Article IV consultation with the Kingdom of Swaziland will be held on the
standard 12-month cycle.
Public Information Notices (PINs) form part of the IMF's efforts to promote transparency of
the IMF's views and analysis of economic developments and policies. With the consent of the
country (or countries) concerned, PINs are issued after Executive Board discussions of Article

Statement by Mr. Majoro on Swaziland
January 10, 2011
My Swazi authorities’ medium-term objectives are guided by the broad based and nationally
owned Poverty Reduction Strategy and Action Program (PRSAP), which prioritizes
enhancing economic growth, improving social spending and ensuring food security, among
others. The key challenges include restoring fiscal sustainability, addressing HIV/AIDS,
reducing poverty and creating employment.
Economic performance
The Swazi economy has been adversely impacted by successive shocks of the lagged impact
of global financial and economic crisis and sharp decline in Southern African Customs Union
(SACU) revenue that has been worsened by past low long-term growth. Growth performance
is projected to moderately recover in the near to medium term on the backdrop of improving
global economy. Inflation has been contained at single digits level and projected to further
decline. Gross international reserves are within the benchmark of 3 months of import cover
and the country’s debt ratios are low.
Fiscal policies
The budget deficit for 2010/11 is projected at a record high of 13 percent of GDP, largely as
a consequence of worsening fiscal position following the sharp drop in SACU revenue. The
authorities recognize that this deficit is unsustainable and are working on a mechanism to
bring the deficit on a sustainable path, starting with a 14 percent expenditure cut across the
board on the 2010/11 budget while protecting and enhancing priority social spending (such
as addressing HIV/AIDS, protecting pro poor funding and poverty reduction). This is a
necessary but not sufficient step in containing expenditures. The authorities are thus
undertaking other expenditure cutting, structural and revenue enhancing measures. On the
revenue side, the authorities have put in place measures to enhance revenue performance
including introduction of new revenue instruments—minimum tax of 3 percent per annum
for the lower end of the tax-payers, capital gains tax and upward revision of casino levy, and
lotteries and gaming taxes as well as value added tax (VAT). The VAT will be implemented
in 2012. Further revenue measures include a proposal to increase sales tax on excisable
goods.
The authorities are aware that the wage bill accounts for the bulk of the recurrent budget and
have put in place several measures to contain and reduce this expenditure item, including a
freeze on recruitment with the exception of priority areas in the health, education and the
newly created Anti-Human Trafficking Unit, and removal of ghost workers from the payroll.
Additionally, capital spending has been reprioritized to on-going projects due to the now
limited scope of introducing new ones. In November 2010, a supplementary budget of E350

2
million was approved by parliament as a rational decision to clear outstanding arrears on an
on-going airport construction project as the alternative—terminating the project—would
have been more costly. This expenditure was financed from under-spending on capital
projects and was thus a re-allocation within the existing budget envelop. The authorities
adopted a Fiscal Adjustment Roadmap (FAR) in October 2010 to build on these measures in
order to bring the budget deficit to a sustainable path in the medium term. Already the
2011/12 budget will be based on the FAR and aims to further reduce the deficit.
The authorities intend to seek an arrangement, possibly an SBA, with the Fund to support
achievement of their objectives and are, therefore, disappointed with the delay in concluding
a Staff-Monitored Program (SMP). An arrangement with the Fund would have enabled the
authorities to conclude a budget support loan from the African Development Bank in order to
address the budget financing gap.

Structural policies
The authorities are keenly aware that attaining and sustaining high economic growth
performance can only be achieved by increased diversification and enhancing
competitiveness. To this end, a study on broadening Swaziland’s economic base and
increasing competitiveness is being undertaken with the assistance of the African
Development Bank. To further enhance revenue performance, a review of income tax
legislation is underway. Moreover, the Swaziland Revenue Authority was launched on July
31, 2010 and became operational on January 1, 2011. The establishment of the SRA has left
about 180 people in the public service, whom the government is considering retiring, as part
of reducing the wage bill. Enactment of VAT legislation has reached an advanced stage and
is about to be sent to parliament for approval. Further measures to reduce expenditures
include implementation of the Alternative Service Delivery (ASD) strategy, which aims at
privatizing some services in government (such as the Central Transport Administration);
establishment of authorities and separating personnel to those authorities (such as the SRA
and the Civil Aviation Authority); and implementation of the voluntary early retirement
program, which is being finalized, aimed at streamlining the overall size of the public service.
In order to address the problem of unemployment, a cabinet committee has been set up to
enhance employment creation.
Despite the low debt ratios, the authorities are committed to ensure continued debt
sustainability for which they are preparing a comprehensive debt strategy in the medium term
in view of the envisaged up-take of external debt.
Monetary and financial policies
Despite the ravages of the global financial and economic crisis, the financial system
remained stable, sound and adequately capitalized. In 2009 the monetary authorities
enhanced its oversight by implementing risk-based supervision framework in order to detect
signs of financial risks and resilience to shocks early.

3
Conclusion
My authorities reiterate their commitment to implementing strong macroeconomic policies
and deeper structural reforms to attain their program objectives. They are implementing
fiscal consolidation and structural reforms in order to restore fiscal sustainability and create
fiscal space to increase priority spending.
