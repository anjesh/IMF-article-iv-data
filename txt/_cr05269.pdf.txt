Staff Report for the 2005 Article IV Consultation
Prepared by the Staff Representatives for the 2005 Consultation with
the United Arab Emirates
Approved by Julian Berengaut and Carlos Muñiz
June 7, 2005
The consultation discussions were held in Abu Dhabi, Dubai, and Sharjah from March 16 through 30, 2005.
The mission team met with the Minister of State for Finance and Industry, the Governor of the Central Bank,
Under Secretaries of the Ministries of Finance and Industry, Economy and Planning, Labor and Social Affairs,
as well as senior officials of the Federal government and the three largest Emirates—Abu Dhabi, Dubai, and
Sharjah. Meetings were also held with representatives of the private sector, commercial banks, stock exchanges,
and chief executives of several public enterprises. The staff team comprised Messrs. Elhage (head), Erbas,
Floerkemeier, Goswami, Ms. Farahbaksh (all MCD), and Mr. Crowley (MFD). The mission was part of the
pilot project to test implementation of the draft MFD-PDR guidance note on financial sector surveillance in
Article IV consultations.
In concluding the last consultation on May 28, 2004, Executive Directors commended the U.A.E. for pursuing
prudent macroeconomic policies, a sound management of oil resources, and an outward-oriented development
strategy. All of these have resulted in low inflation and high growth, as well as sizable fiscal and external
current account surpluses, and the accumulation of foreign assets. Further, they noted that sound policies
supported by structural reforms have enhanced the role of the private sector, contributed to growth of the
nonhydrocarbon sector and diversification of the economy, and strengthened the economy’s resilience to
external shocks.
To sustain U.A.E.’s strong economic performance, Directors saw scope for further strengthening fiscal policy,
the financial sector, and the economic structure. They called on the authorities to improve the structure of the
budget over the medium term. Directors encouraged the authorities to set up a transparent investment regime,
and to improve ownership rights for foreigners. They commended the authorities for the provision of data on
the government’s foreign assets. However, they noted that improvements in the U.A.E.’s economic statistics,
with regard to data quality, coverage, periodicity, timeliness, and consistency, depend on increased coordination
between the Federal and Emirates’ authorities and the training of staff.
The United Arab Emirates has accepted the obligations of Article VIII, Sections 2, 3, and 4. It has also accepted
the Fourth Amendment of the Fund’s Articles of Agreement.
Appendices I and II provide information on relations with the Fund and the World Bank Group, respectively.
Statistical issues are discussed in Appendix III. Financial sector developments, including the status of 2001
FSAP recommendations, are discussed in Appendix IV. Appendix V presents the background section of the
Press Information Notice (PIN).

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
Background
In 2004, reflecting sharply higher oil prices and increased oil production, strong investor confidence,
and a significant increase in foreign direct investment (FDI), economic growth in the U.A.E. is
estimated to have been very strong. Real nonhydrocarbon GDP growth is estimated at 10 percent. Both
the external current account and consolidated fiscal balances are estimated to have recorded large
surpluses, 12 percent and 18.3 percent of GDP, respectively. The nonhydrocarbon deficit also narrowed.
Prices in the real estate and the stock markets have soared aided by stronger economic fundamentals and
investor optimism. Inflation as measured by the Consumer Price Index increased by 4.6 percent.
The banking sector in the U.A.E remains strong, bolstered by effective supervision. Overall, the capitalassets ratio declined slightly to just under 17 percent and the ratio of net nonperforming loans to total
loans remained below 4 percent. Major steps have been taken to put in place a strong legal framework to
prevent money laundering and financing of terrorist activities. The Dubai International Financial Center
(DIFC) began operations in September 2004 and significant progress has been made with respect to the
regulatory framework governing the DIFC which has been benchmarked to best international practices.

Medium-term Context
On the basis of current expectations for oil prices and current policy stance, the medium-term outlook
remains favorable. However, pressures may build for an increase in expenditures to address the
emerging unemployment and potential unfunded pension liabilities. Also, there are some risks in the
system that warrant close monitoring, in particular, soaring asset prices and accelerating inflationary
pressure.

Staff Appraisal
An outward-oriented development strategy and prudent financial policies have resulted in impressive
economic growth over the years. Economic diversification has advanced rapidly, underpinned by an
increasing role of the private sector. Openness, favorable business environment, and a good record in
macroeconomic management have laid the foundation for further economic and social progress in the
period ahead.
There is a need for full rationalization and consolidation of the regulatory oversight related to the capital
markets and nonfinancial bank intermediaries. Also, regulations pertaining to investment and finance
companies will need to be strengthened, and gaps need to be addressed in order to safeguard investor
interests. Employment opportunities for nationals will need to be created through long-term structural
policies in the areas of education, training, wage policy, and labor legislation.
The structure of the budget needs to be strengthened. On the expenditure side, government employment
needs to be contained and rewards increasingly based on productivity. The revenue base could be
broadened by introducing a VAT system at the Federal level and the Emirates could consider
introducing a property tax. Financial polices might need to be tightened to contain inflationary pressure.
Fiscal transparency needs to be improved and there is an urgent need to address the numerous structural
weaknesses with respect to data quality, coverage, periodicity, timeliness, and inter-sectoral consistency.

I. BACKGROUND
1.
The U.A.E. is a confederation of seven Emirates1 each operating under
considerable autonomy. This arrangement leaves a great deal of independence to the
individual Emirates in pursuing an economic strategy based on their respective
comparative advantages. Abu Dhabi, which accounts for about 95 percent of the
U.A.E.’s oil and natural gas resources, has pursued prudent economic policies and
continues to develop its hydrocarbon capacity along with saving considerable
financial assets. Dubai is emerging as a model for economic diversification of the
nonhydrocarbon sector and vying for being a leading business hub in the global
marketplace. These two Emirates account for about 85 percent of the country’s total
GDP. The other Emirates rely on a mix of trade and light manufacturing, and they
depend on financial support from the Federal government and Abu Dhabi and Dubai
governments.
2.
The U.A.E. has relatively small national working age population—albeit
rapidly rising and reliant on government jobs—and is, therefore, highly dependent on
a large expatriate labor force. In 2004, nationals in the U.A.E. accounted for about
9 percent and 21 percent of the total labor force and population, respectively.
3.
In recent years, the Fund’s policy advice has encouraged the authorities
to strengthen fiscal policy and address data deficiencies across sectors.
Modernization of the financial sector’s legal framework and improvement in
securities and insurance supervision and regulation have also been recommended.
The decentralized policymaking process and the complexity of the U.A.E.’s political
structure have made it difficult for the authorities to implement the Fund’s policy
recommendations in the fiscal area. In contrast, important progress has been made in
financial sector reforms, as the Central Bank of the U.A.E. (CBU) has unified
authority over most institutions in the sector.
4.
The U.A.E.’s economic statistics suffer from numerous structural
weaknesses with respect to data quality, coverage, periodicity, timeliness, and
inter-sectoral consistency (discussed in Appendix III), all of which have
hampered the staff’s ability to conduct economic analysis and effective
surveillance. Increased coordination between Federal and Emirate authorities,
adequate resources allocated to data collection and management, and training of staff
are necessary conditions for further progress on data issues.

The seven Emirates are Abu Dhabi, Dubai, Sharjah, Ajman, Ras al-Khaimah, Umm al-Qaiwain, and Fujairah.

II. RECENT DEVELOPMENTS
A. Introduction
5.
Reflecting sharply higher oil prices and increased oil production, strong
investor confidence, and a significant increase in FDI, economic growth in the
U.A.E. is estimated to have been very strong in 2004. The depreciation of the
U.A.E. dirham (AED) in real effective terms and the strong economic growth in the
U.A.E.’s export markets helped drive a faster growth in manufactured exports.
6.
The pace of liberalization gained momentum, in particular in Dubai and to
a lesser extent in the other Emirates. Dubai’s policy of extending foreign ownership
of land and properties for real estate developments has resulted in a construction
boom and a significant increase in FDI in this sector. Sharjah has established a
number of industrial free zones while Abu Dhabi has embraced utility privatization,
with the objective of privatizing its entire water and electricity sector by 2006.
Consideration is being given in Abu Dhabi to follow Dubai’s example of relaxing
government control over the real estate market.
7.
Diversification and competitiveness of the economy continue to be
achieved by maintaining a business-friendly environment with good
infrastructure. Access to expatriate workers at internationally competitive wages has
also contributed to the efficiency of the economy. These factors have made the
U.A.E. an attractive place to invest in, particularly in the free zones, for companies
seeking to serve the growing markets of the Middle East, North Africa, India, and
Pakistan (Box 1).
8.
In 2004, financial market developments in the U.A.E. were dominated by
further strengthening of banks’ balance sheets and significant increases in asset
prices. The stronger overall financial position and improved fundamentals of the
economy prompted a one-notch upgrade of the U.A.E.’s sovereign rating, to A1 by
Moody’s in October 2004.

The U.A.E., led by Dubai, has strived to provide a
stable economic and efficiently functioning business
environment. The perception of the global business
community has been relatively favorable in terms of
economic, financial and investment risks. The Growth
Competitive Index for 2004—a composite of
macroeconomic environment, state of public
institutions, and technology readiness—ranks the
U.A.E. 16th in the world with a high score of 5.21 and
at the top of the list among the Gulf Cooperation
Council (GCC) countries. Euro money has classified
the U.A.E. as the safest Arab country for investment.

The U.A.E. fares well in most of the priority areas of
investment climate. Based on the Executive Opinion
Survey in the Arab World (The Arab World
Competitiveness Report 2002–03), the U.A.E. ranks the
highest in having the least burdensome administrative
regulations when compared to its GCC peers. When
benchmarked on global standards, the U.A.E. ranks
fourth, following Singapore, Hong Kong and Iceland.

The U.A.E. ranks 25th on a global scale in Information
and Communication Technology (ICT). The government
has been very proactive in prioritizing ICT as a basis for
improving efficiency and delivery. Also, at the firm level,
technological absorption has been among the most
advanced, while public access to internet has grown to
have one of the highest intensity.

Based on the World Bank’s survey for Doing Business, the cost to create collateral (taxes, fees and duties
associated with creating and registering collateral) as a percent of income per capita and the rigidity of
employment are low when compared to its regional average. Bank financing is relatively accessible although
capital markets are still in the incipient stages. However, due to low disclosure standards, protecting investors’
contracts still need reform. Also, the number of procedures and the cost of enforcing contracts are burdensome,
lagging global benchmarks such as OECD.

Major revisions have been made to

rose by 3 percent (Table 1). Growth was broad-based with most sub-sectors growing
at historically high rates, with manufacturing leading the way, followed by services
and construction.
11.
The strength of the economy and
higher import prices have, however, put
upward pressure on prices. Inflation, as
measured by the Consumer Price Index (CPI)
is estimated to have increased by 4.6 percent
in 2004 with a large rise in the price of
nontradable goods, in particular, rents which
account for 36 percent of the CPI.3

The upward revisions, among other factors, reflect updated information on electricity and water, trade, and
tourism sectors. Also, the significant upward revision in the growth rate of the construction sector reflects the
results of a 2003 survey.

3

A number of shortcomings affect the CPI, including: outdated weights, lack of imputations for missing data,
and period differences between the base price and expenditure weights. Unofficially, it has been reported that
rent which accounts for about 36 percent of the CPI basket has increased by 20 percent in 2004.

13.
The financial account balance is estimated to have registered a net
outflow of about $11 billion due mainly to placements of official capital abroad.
FDI increased significantly since 2001, in particular from the GCC countries. It is
estimated that net FDI reached about $9 billion in 2004. The overall balance of
payments registered a surplus of $3.5 billion.
Fiscal policy
14.
The budgetary system of the U.A.E. continued to impede a timely and
accurate assessment of overall fiscal developments. With a lack of uniformity
among the seven Emirates and the Federal government in the classification of
expenditures and revenues, the unavailability of data on government’s investment
income, and considerable netting out of fiscal operations at the Emirate level,
comprehensive analysis of the fiscal developments remains difficult. Nevertheless,
the availability of data on net accumulation of government foreign assets allowed the
staff to prepare the overall fiscal accounts from the financing side.
15.
The fiscal position of Abu Dhabi improved considerably in 2004 on
account of high oil revenues and moderate expenditure increases. A significant
part of the increase in oil revenues was saved as part of official assets held abroad.
Also, the government restructured some of its ministries, downsized the workforce in
the municipalities, and outsourced some of the services delivered by the municipality
to the private sector. Subsidies were reduced further, mainly due to a continued
decline in agricultural subsidies.4
4

The analysis of 2004 subsidies of Abu Dhabi Finance excludes the amount of AD 1,261 million, a one-time
settlement, paid to Abu Dhabi Water and Electricity Authority for settlement of the 1999–2002 accounts.

-9-

16.
The two other key Emirates, Dubai and Sharjah, maintained their policy
of executing a budget that is largely in balance. However, a comprehensive
assessment of Dubai’s fiscal performance is limited by the fact that considerable
fiscal operations are carried out outside Dubai’s budget, and information on these
operations is currently not available.

nonhydrocarbon fiscal deficit is estimated to
have narrowed by about 4.5 percent of GDP,

Monetary developments
19.
Strong economic activity and high
capital inflows resulted in a significant
increase in broad money (23 percent).6
The monetization was accompanied by a
strong expansion in credit to the private
sector, which increased by 24.7 percent in
2004 compared to 13.5 percent in 2003
(Table 4). Much of the private sector credit
consisted of loans to the wholesale trade
sector and personal loans for business.
Domestic interest rates largely moved in

Financial developments
20.
The banking sector in the U.A.E remains strong, bolstered by effective
supervision, sound lending practices, and a vibrant economy. At end-2004, while
the official ratio of nonperforming loans (NPL) to total loans remained somewhat
high at 12.5 percent7, provisions were considerable, bringing the net NPL ratio below
4 percent (Table 5). Overall, the capital-assets ratio (CAR) declined slightly to just
under 17 percent, as banks increased their lending activities, but remains well above
prudential norms for all banks.
21.
Banks’ exposures to the booming real estate sector have so far been
limited.8 Most real estate buyers make cash purchases, while banks continue to be
reluctant to lend more than 70 percent of the value of the property. At end-2004,
banks’ direct lending as a percent of total loans for real estate declined to 4.7 percent
from 5.4 percent in 2003. Lending to the construction sector grew by 18 percent
during 2004, though as a percent of total lending it declined to 12.8 percent from
13.6 percent. Information on the nonbank financial sector exposure to the real estate
sector is not available.
6

Starting in mid-2001, the CBU started to include deposits of U.A.E. residents booked in overseas
branches/subsidiaries of locally incorporated banks in the measurement of broad money. During the 2005
Article IV mission, the authorities indicated that they will look into staff’s recommendations to exclude these
deposits from broad money statistics. Staff presentation and discussion of monetary developments are based on
internationally accepted standards that exclude such deposits.
7

Most of these loans are loans from the 1980s and early 1990s that remain on the books because of laws that do
not allow for the writing off of loans as long as there is a chance that they will be repaid.
8

In the absence of available data on the real estate market, the staff was not able to assess developments in this
sector. Unofficially, it is reported that real estate prices have doubled in the past two years.

- 11 -

22.
The U.A.E. securities markets, the Abu Dhabi Securities Market (ADSM) and
the Dubai Securities Market (DSM), have witnessed significant growth since their
inceptions in 2001 (Box 2). Total market capitalization tripled to slightly over $82 billion,
while the cumulative value of the shares traded increased from $2 billion in 2003 to
$18 billion in 2004. The P/E ratio in ASDM increased from 13 percent to 22 percent during
the same period. The composite index of the two markets increased by 88 percent in 2004,
after having increased by 32 percent in 2003.9
23.
Supervision of securities continues to be strengthened by making the
Emirate Securities and Commodities Authority (ESCA) operational, increasing
its staff and providing those staff with training. Also, listing and disclosure
requirements have been clarified, effectively eliminating the “Over the Counter”
market. Transparency has been strengthened by publishing some major laws and
circulars on the internet, and by maintaining a continuous two way dialogue with
banks on supervision, laws, and regulations.
24.
Major steps have been taken to put in place a strong legal framework to
prevent money laundering and financing of terrorist activities. Two laws were
passed in 2004, one on dealing with financing of terrorism and the other addressing
AML/CFT issues in the financial free zones. A law criminalizing money laundering
that was adopted in 2002 has been widely cited as a model of best practices. Hawala
dealers continue to voluntarily register and have been certified by the CBU. As of
end-February 2005, the CBU has received 156 registration applications and

The Dubai International Financial Center (DIFC) began operations in
September 2004. As of mid-March 2005, 11 financial institutions have been granted licenses
to operate within the free zone. It is expected that this number will rise to about 50 by endyear. Also, considerable progress has been made with respect to the regulatory framework
governing the DIFC, and an extensive set of laws has been established based on best
international practices.
III. REPORT ON DISCUSSIONS
A. Near- and Medium-term Outlook
26.
Based on the latest World Economic Outlook (WEO) oil price projection,
large fiscal and external current account surpluses are projected in 2005.
Nonhydrocarbon GDP growth is projected at about 7 percent supported mainly by
strong growth in the manufacturing, transport, and construction sectors. Reflecting
the price pressure in the nontradable sector, the CPI is projected to reach 6 percent.

As of mid-May 2005, the composite index of the U.A.E. has increased by over 75 percent since the beginning
of the year.

Box 2: U.A.E. Securities Market
The growth in the U.A.E. securities market can be traced to a number of factors, including: (a) shift of
funds from abroad to the region in the aftermath of 9/11; (b) an increase in the number of listed companies
(from 15 companies at end-2001 to 55 companies by March 2005); (c) strong profitability of quoted companies
(banks’ profits grew by about 40 percent in 2004); (d) weak performance of the international markets; (e) the
opening up and privatization of a number of sectors, such as real estate; and finally (f) low interest rates in the
country.
Notwithstanding recent developments, the U.A.E. markets are relatively shallow, concentrated, and retail
based. Only 5 companies made up over 60 percent of the total value of trade at end-2004 in ADSM. Changes in
the prices of one real estate company, was responsible for half of the market index increase in DSM, while
changes in the price of a communication company, resulted in about half of the increase in ADSM index. The
role of institutional investors remains limited, in part because of prohibition on purchase of own shares by listed
companies, lack of corporate retirement schemes, and a lack of market makers and underwriters.
Banking sector’s direct exposure to the equity markets other than IPOs was limited in 2004 at about
1.8 percent of total banking system’s loan portfolio. CBU regulations limit total bank lending to 100 percent
of total stable resources.1 Other CBU regulations place caps on bank financing of IPOs and purchases of
securities. Nonetheless, banks’ exposure to the securities market through the financing of IPOs grew
significantly in 2004, prompting the CBU to issue circulars requiring banks to strictly observe the regulations,
and also not to lend more than 5 times the margin provided by customer for subscribing to new IPOs.

Since the return of the mission on March 30, the President of the U.A.E, Sheikh
Khalifa bin Zayed Al Nahyan, announced an increase in salaries (25 percent for nationals
and 15 percent for non-nationals) for Federal and Abu Dhabi’s government employees. The
other major Emirates have followed suit. The staff’s preliminary assessment indicates that

- 13 -

the fiscal impact from the proposed salary increase will be limited to 0.5 percent of GDP.10
However, the staff is of the view that the stimulus impact of this measure will add to the
inflationary pressures already in the system and would increase the reservation wage in the
public sector. The latter would adversely affect the incentive structure and discourage
nationals to seek jobs in the private sector.
28.
In discussions with the authorities during the spring meetings, the staff was
informed that political pressure has been mounting for some time to increase salaries
and that with the sustained rise in oil prices the political leadership felt that there is a need to
transfer part of the windfall from oil to the population. As for the economic impact of this
measure, they were of the view that while the fiscal impact would be minimal they stood
ready to tighten monetary conditions if needed.
29.
The medium-term outlook remains favorable based on current
expectations that world oil prices will remain high11 and oil production will
increase steadily to more than 3 million barrels per day by 2010 (Box 3). Real
nonhydrocarbon GDP growth is projected to remain robust as the economy gains
traction from the ongoing productivity enhancing structural reforms, improved
investment regime, and a more streamlined business climate. During 2006–10, both
the fiscal and external current account balances are projected to continue to register
large surpluses averaging about 22.5 percent and 17 percent of GDP, respectively
(Table 6).
30.
Although the medium-term outlook is based on historically high levels of
oil price and production assumptions, the downside risks to the projected
outlook from a drop in oil prices are somewhat limited. The staff estimates that
the overall fiscal position will remain in balance with oil price as low as $23.3 per
barrel during 2005–10.12 However, there are additional risks in the system that
warrant close monitoring, in particular, soaring asset prices and accelerating
inflationary pressure, especially if reported inflation is under estimating actual
inflation.13 Also, sudden shifts in global interest rates could dampen current investor
confidence.

10

A blanket increase (25 percent for nationals and 15 percent for non-nationals) would amount to
US$0.6 billion or 0.5 percent of GDP. The consolidated fiscal surplus would continue to register a surplus of
22.6 percent of GDP in 2005.
11

In line with the April 2005 WEO projections, oil prices are projected to decline only marginally to an average
of $45.8 between 2006–10.
12

The staff estimates that for each $1 drop in the price of barrel of oil, on average, the fiscal balance will
weaken by about 1 percent of GDP during 2005–10.

well above their quota. However, there are still concerns
about a market mismatch regarding the crude oil qualities
demanded and supplied. International oil markets are short of light sweet crude; while there have been signs of
an oversupply of heavy sour grades, particularly from Arab oil producing countries. While oil market conditions
will remain tight in the near future, there are also indications of easing in the medium term, as demand growth is
projected to slow markedly and significant new production capacity (both within and outside OPEC) will come
on stream in the coming years.
Prospects for the U.A.E. hydrocarbon sector: With a production close to capacity at about 2.5m b/d, the
U.A.E. currently rank as the 9th largest crude oil producer and 6th largest net oil exporter worldwide. However,
the country’s role in the global oil market will certainly increase further in the future, as its oil reserves amount
to nearly 10 percent of the world total. Presently, Abu Dhabi is embarking upon large scale expansion projects
which will lift the U.A.E.’s oil production to about 3m b/d

in 2010 and to up to 4m b/d in the longer term. At the same
time, continued massive investments in natural gas
production and infrastructure will—in combination with
gas imports from Qatar—satisfy the country’s rapidly rising
domestic gas demand (for electricity generation,
petrochemical feedstock, and reinjection into oil fields) and
create new potentials for the exportation of condensates
and natural gas liquids. Industry sources estimate total
investment in the U.A.E.’s hydrocarbon sector at more than
$30bn over the next ten years. Unlike most Gulf oil
producing countries, international oil companies participate
in the U.A.E.’s hydrocarbon sector, both sharing the burden in funding enhanced oil recovery projects and
capacity expansions and providing state-of-the-art technology.

B. Policy Discussions
31.
The sustainability of U.A.E.’s growth prospects hinges on both the continued
implementation of structural reforms and on maintaining financial stability. These

- 15 -

reforms should aim at improving the budget structure and fiscal coordination among the
Emirates and the Federal government, promoting private investment by lifting remaining
impediments to foreign investments outside the free zones areas, and enhancing the long-run
employability of the national labor force through training and education. Also, financial
policies might need to be tightened to contain inflationary pressures.
32.
To reinforce government’s policies already in place and to address some of the
above issues, the staff stressed the need for better coordination among the Emirates and
the Federal government. The staff also underscored the importance of enhancing
transparency, particularly in the fiscal area, in order to improve the policymaking
environment and to ensure that the fiscal policy stance is consistent with overall
macroeconomic objectives. The staff also reviewed risks and developments in the financial
sector and assessed performance in following up on the remaining recommendations of
the 2001 FSAP mission (Appendix IV).
C. Macroeconomic Policies
Fiscal policies
33.
Fiscal policy coordination among the Emirates and the Federal
government remains weak, and standardization of their accounting systems is
still piece-meal. There is also considerable netting out of fiscal operations at the
Emirates level.14 Against this backdrop, discussions of fiscal policies were conducted
separately at the Federal level and with the Emirates, anchoring on Abu Dhabi’s fiscal
policies and the public administration reforms of the Federal government. Reforms on
key issues such as widening the tax base on a Federation-wide scale and reducing
subsidies on water and electricity in Abu Dhabi were also discussed.
34.
The government of Abu Dhabi continues to manage its hydrocarbon
receipts by setting the budget at a relatively conservative oil price ($28 per barrel
in 2005), while saving and investing most of its fiscal surpluses abroad through its
main investment arm, Abu Dhabi Investment Authority (ADIA). Also, the
government has taken a number of measures to contain current expenditures, in
particular subsidies on agriculture and to streamline the wage bill through a
combination of downsizing of employment and corporatization of certain services.
The recent wage increase is expected to add about 0.11 percent of GDP to
Abu Dhabi’s wage bill.
35.
The U.A.E.’s Federal government continues to play an important role in
the federation and often leads in public administration reforms. However, its own
finances are constrained and revenue limited to some fees and charges and block
14

It seems that most off-budget operations appear to be undertaken on a commercial basis, which reduces the
risk of inefficiencies and misallocation of resources.

- 16 -

transfers from the Emirates of Abu Dhabi (mainly) and Dubai that have been constant
over time.
36.
The authorities informed the staff that the Federal government is
currently developing a framework for better policy coordination among the
Emirates. To this end, a new economic planning committee has been formed to
improve coordination across the Emirates on these fronts. This could bring about
uniformity in the budget classifications and enhance analysis of fiscal policy.
37.
The consolidated fiscal position15 is projected to remain in significant
surplus over the medium term. Also, the fiscal position is sustainable for the
foreseeable future under the current baseline scenario, based on the intergenerational
equity objective of maintaining net wealth constant in real terms. If oil prices were to
decline to $25 per barrel, the annual fiscal adjustment needed to maintain net wealth
constant in real terms would be on average about 1 percent of 2005 GDP for
the 2005–10 period. While implicitly financial savings from the government’s oil
revenues are based on the objective of saving for future generations, the authorities do
not explicitly follow the inter-generational equity objectives of maintaining net
wealth constant over time. In discussions with the authorities in the Emirate of
Abu Dhabi, they indicated that they will continue to prepare their budget on a
conservative oil price assumption.
38.
The fiscal policy stance as measured by the nonhydrocarbon fiscal deficit
(excluding investment income) as percent of nonhydrocarbon GDP indicates a
narrowing trend since 2001. Nonetheless, given the limitations of monetary policy
under a fixed exchange rate system, the burden of tightening financial policies to stem
inflationary pressure will likely fall on fiscal policy. This task, however, is
complicated by the decentralized fiscal policy structure in the U.A.E.
39.
In the period ahead, pressures may build for an increase in expenditures
to address the emerging unemployment and potential unfunded pension
liabilities. Accordingly, the staff recommended that steps be initiated to strengthen
the structure of the budget.
40.
On the revenue side, the staff recommended broadening the tax base by
extending the corporate income tax to the nonhydrocarbon sector, and
introducing a value-added-tax (VAT) system.16 A VAT system will allow the
Federal government to reduce its dependence on charges and fees. The authorities
agreed on the need to broaden the tax base and informed the staff that discussions on

Apart from a profit tax on oil and gas companies, a corporate income tax of 20 percent on foreign banks, and
low import tariffs, the U.A.E. has no other sources of tax revenue.

- 17 -

the introduction of the VAT have gained momentum at the cabinet level. To pave the
way for the introduction of the VAT, the authorities have requested Fund’s technical
assistance. Also, the Emirates should consider introducing a property tax.
41.
On the expenditure side, the staff welcomed the further reduction in agricultural
subsidies in the Emirate of Abu Dhabi and recommended that the government of Abu
Dhabi continue to enhance the efficiency of its power and utility sector through
privatization and gradually reducing subsidies on water and electricity. While the
recent announcement of the wage increase for 2005 by the Federal government, followed by
the individual Emirates, is unlikely to dent the fiscal situation, it amplifies lingering concerns
over the issue of policy coordination among the Emirates and the Federal government.
Monetary policy and the financial sector
42.
In the context of the fixed exchange rate system and full capital account
convertibility, the authorities agreed with the staff that the effectiveness of
monetary policy is limited. Local interest rates are closely aligned with the
U.S. dollar rates, and the main monetary instrument currently used by the CBU to
smooth out fluctuations in domestic liquidity is certificates of deposits (CDs). The
staff welcomed the CBU’s plans to issue CDs with longer maturities of up to
60 months, which would broaden the availability of instruments to mop up liquidity
and facilitate the development of a repo market based on CDs.
43.
Due to continued projected capital inflows, money supply growth is
projected to remain high in 2005. The staff recommended that the authorities
tighten credit conditions to slowdown credit growth to the private sector and contain
pressures on the prices of nontradables. The authorities agreed with the staff’s
recommendations and indicated that consideration was being given to raising reserve
requirements on demand deposits. The staff also recommended introducing tighter
prudential norms, including higher provisioning rates for specific types of credit
instruments, such as credit cards, higher required down payments, and stricter
collateral requirements on loans.
44.
There is a need for full rationalization and consolidation of regulatory
oversight related to capital markets and nonbank financial intermediaries. Most
importantly, the CBU and ESCA will need to coordinate closely to ensure that a
comprehensive supervisory framework for the entire financial sector is in place. The
authorities agreed with the staff’s recommendations that they request a Reports on
Standards and Codes (ROSC) mission, from the Fund, which was not conducted
during the 2001 FSAP.
45.
The staff stressed that laws and regulations pertaining to investment and
finance companies will need to be strengthened, and gaps need to be addressed
in order to safeguard investor interests. The staff welcomed the CBU’s role in
ensuring that banks are adequately shielded from market risk associated with their

- 18 -

investment companies. However, staff stressed that the 1994 Law on Investment
Companies needs to be updated to ensure that they are in full compliance with the
International Organization of Securities Commission areas of regulatory concern and
risk assessment methods, such as proper and disclosed basis for asset valuation,
suitability of investment schemes, and pricing.
46.
The DIFC has made considerable progress in developing a regulatory
framework that follows best international practices. The unique nature of the
governance relationships involved, and the broad scope of its activities raise some
concern about what risks are being created and what effects, if any, there may be on
the monetary system of the U.A.E.17 The authorities in the U.A.E. and DIFC have
agreed with the staff that it would be useful to have the operations and regulatory
arrangements of the DIFC assessed by the Fund. A mission for that purpose could
potentially take place in late 2005 or early 2006.
D. Structural Policies
Restructuring and privatization
47.
The staff welcomed the broadening of FDI opportunities in the export
free zones in Dubai. However, it stressed that equally important in promoting foreign
direct investment is the establishment of an unambiguous legal framework for the
private sector. In this regard, the staff urged the authorities at the Federal and Emirate
levels to implement FDI legislation that is market-based and tailored to allow
individual Emirates to pursue their respective economic development strategies. The
authorities agreed with staff’s recommendation and noted that, in line with efforts to
continue the process of economic diversification, the U.A.E. is amending the
Commercial Company Law, applicable across the federation, which may see the
ceiling on foreign ownership raised from the current 49 percent.
48.
The creation in 2004 of the Dubai International Arbitration Centre
(DIAC) is also a welcome development. This institution is based on International
Chamber of Commerce rules and has the potential to help solve business disputes
quicker and foster international trade and investment. The authorities informed the
staff that the Dubai Chamber of Commerce and Industry is also preparing to establish
a credit rating and reporting agency (affiliated with an international credit agency)
that will operate in the U.A.E. and eventually GCC wide.

17

Since both the operating and regulatory arms of the DIFC are subordinate to the Government of Dubai, the
governance structure holds the potential for conflicts of interest regarding regulations. Also, since nationals are
allowed to open non-dirham investment accounts and borrow in foreign currency from the DIFC, the impact of
these operations on monetary developments needs to be monitored closely.

- 19 -

49.
The privatization of Abu Dhabi’s utilities sector is proceeding as planned.
In 2004, one power plant was sold to private investors. Further privatization of the
remaining three state-owned power generation companies and the two power
distribution companies is being considered. The staff is of the view that the
implementation of the privatization plan of Abu Dhabi’s water and power sector
could act as a catalyst for broadening the role of the private sector and for gradually
reducing electricity and water subsidies.18 In this connection, the staff welcomed the
elimination of some subsidized tariffs, such as those for government buildings, and
the plan to gradually install water meters in all households.
Labor policies
50.
The staff stressed that it is critical that any future changes to labor policy
do not adversely impact the competitiveness of the economy. So far, most of the
jobs in the private sector have been filled by expatriate workers, with the majority of
nationals continuing to seek employment in the public sector. As a result, the
authorities have implemented a string of new measures in recent years to increase the
cost associated with hiring expatriate workers (Box 4). The liberal labor policies
adopted thus far in the U.A.E. have allowed the private sector to recruit expatriate
workers at internationally competitive wages. These policies have contributed to the
economic growth and improved competitiveness of the non-oil economy in the
U.A.E., which in turn resulted in job creation for nationals.
51.
Employment opportunities for nationals will need to be created through longterm structural policies in the areas of education, training, wage policy, and labor
legislation. In this connection, the staff welcomed the measures taken by the authorities to
create employment opportunities for U.A.E. nationals in the private sector.
E. External Sector
52.
The authorities noted that the pegged exchange rate regime has served
the U.A.E. economy well by providing a nominal anchor and strengthening
confidence in its economic policy. They also indicated that the exchange rate
credibility is further reinforced by the policy commitment toward the GCC monetary
union by 2010. Reflecting developments in the dollar exchange rate, the real effective
exchange rate (REER) (based on consumer prices) has depreciated by more than
13 percent during 2002–04, but has appreciated by about 20 percent since 1990. The
cumulative appreciation does not seem to have eroded competitiveness, the role of the
private sector has been enhanced and the economy is among the most diversified in

and Water Authority (DEWA) appears to be able to recover costs by charging the large expatriate population at
commercial tariff rates.

53.
The authorities informed the staff that progress continued in regional
integration. Negotiations are ongoing among the GCC countries to prepare a
common list of items to be prohibited for security and religious reasons. In
connection with the envisaged monetary union among the members of the GCC,
deliberations are continuing on: (a) identifying issues that would need to be addressed
in establishing a common central bank; (b) establishing a common data standard and
a common fiscal accounting framework to facilitate the adoption of macroeconomic
convergence criteria by 2005; and (c) identifying other areas that would need further
harmonization.
54.
Recently, the staff was informed that the governors of the GCC central
banks and monetary agencies have agreed on five convergence criteria which are
similar to those adopted by the European countries as part of the Maastricht
Treaty in 1992. The proposed convergence criteria have been discussed at a recent
GCC Ministerial Meeting and are expected to be presented for approval at the Heads
of State Summit at end-2005 or early 2006.
55.
The U.A.E. has continued to forge ahead with closer economic integration
beyond the GCC countries. Recently, the U.A.E. signed a Trade and Investment
Framework Agreement (TIFA) with the U.S., which is likely to pave the way for a more
comprehensive Free Trade Agreement (FTA) in the next few years. The authorities stressed
that due attention was being paid to the GCC customs union agreement as they prevail at
present in their FTA negotiations with the U.S. Nonetheless, they indicated that in the period
ahead all other FTAs would be negotiated at the GCC level.

- 21 -

Box 4: Labor Market Developments and Prospects
During 1999–2004, reflecting the high increase of national population and the large influx of expatriate workers
the U.A.E.’s population grew at an average rate of 7.3 percent a year, reaching 4.3 million by mid-2004.
Nationals accounted for about 21 percent of the total population. For the same period, the economy created
annually an average of 177 000 jobs compared to 18 000 annual increases in the national labor force.
On average, it is estimated that for each 1 percent growth in the non-oil economy, employment increased by
about 1.4 percent during 1999–04. While economic growth was more than sufficient to absorb the new entrants
to the labor force, unemployment among nationals increased gradually from 7.6 percent in 1999 to 11.4 percent
in 2004. The total number of unemployed nationals reached 29,000.
Nationals continue to have a strong preference to be employed in the public sector for three main reasons:
(i) the high wages offered in the government sector, which, on average, the nationals cannot obtain in the
private sector; (ii) the relative lack of marketable skills of nationals to compete with inexpensive expatriate
labor employed in the private sector; and (iii) shorter working hours and other nonwage benefits.
The authorities have taken a number of important steps to address the rising unemployment among nationals
and to increase their employment in the private sector. They include: (a) training and job placement programs to
match the needs of the private sector; (b) job counseling, including public awareness programs at the secondary
school and higher education levels; (c) enactment of a pension plan for nationals working in the private sector in
a plan equivalent to that which applies to the public sector; (d) entrepreneurship programs that provide funds at
low rates to nationals for them to start their own businesses; (e) increasing the cost of expatriate labor through
higher visa charges and other fees; and, (f) Emiratization through quotas for nationals in targeted sectors
(banking, insurance, and more recently, trade).
U.A.E.’s general policy has been to avoid straining private sector resources by imposing wide-ranging
employment quotas for nationals. This is a welcome policy because of the significance of expatriate labor’s
contribution to growth and to maintaining the competitiveness of the economy. Some additional measures that
could be considered include: (a) orienting the education system toward encouraging the nationals to acquire
skills that are more marketable in the private sector; (b) taking measures to equalize the number of work days
and work hours in the private and public sectors; (c) providing unemployment benefits to nationals who work in
the private sector; and (d) minimizing restrictions on expatriate job mobility to enhance labor market efficiency,
which could also result in an increase in non-nationals’ wages and improve the competitiveness of nationals.

IV. STATISTICAL ISSUES
56.
The staff welcomed the authorities’ cooperative approach in the provision
of detailed estimates of official foreign assets of the government. Some measures
to improve the institutional statistics framework have been initiated. In particular, the
members of the Inter-Ministerial Statistical Committee (SC) consisting of statistical
directors from all Emirates as well as from Federal government ministries have met
six times during the past year. A GDDS coordinator has been identified at the
Ministry of Economy and Planning (MOEP), but no nomination has yet been made.
The 2005 population census is in the preparation phase, and the authorities plan to

- 22 -

carry out standardized country-wide Household Budget Surveys and sectoral
Business Establishment Surveys based on the census results.
57.
The staff stressed that the U.A.E.’s economic statistics continue to suffer
from numerous structural weaknesses with respect to data quality, coverage,
periodicity, timeliness, and inter-sectoral consistency. Data compilation and
reporting are hampered by a shortage of trained staff and poor coordination within
and between Emirates and Federal government agencies. These shortcomings have
imposed severe constraints on economic monitoring, analysis, and policy formulation
for both the authorities and the staff.
58.
The staff also stressed that, looking forward, there is a need to adopt a
consistent and comprehensive set of public sector fiscal accounts using a common
methodology across the individual Emirates and the Federal government budget
systems. In preparation for the GCC-wide monetary union by 2010, issues related to
fiscal convergence criteria will need to be addressed. As such, consolidated fiscal
accounts for the seven Emirates and the Federal government based on harmonized
classifications and methodologies will need to be developed and be available without
significant delay.
59.
The staff recommended that, in the near term and until the SC becomes
more active, progress could be made by strengthening the current institutional
base that exists at the CBU and the MOEP for the compilation of financial,
national, and price statistics. To address fiscal data issues, a Committee of Fiscal
Policy Coordination should be formed within the Ministry of Finance and Industry to
provide coordination between the Federal government and the seven individual
Emirates with respect to the harmonization of classification and methodology.
V. STAFF APPRAISAL
60.
An outward-oriented development strategy and prudent financial policies have
resulted in impressive economic growth over the years and have led to large
accumulation of external financial assets. As a result, economic diversification has
advanced rapidly, supported by an increasing role of the private sector. Also, openness,
sustained investment in physical and social infrastructure, and a good record in
macroeconomic management have laid the foundation for further economic and social
progress in the period ahead.
61.
The combined effect of surging oil and non-oil exports, strong domestic demand,
and booming stock and real estate markets have created much optimism on the
economic front. Also, given the projected favorable prospects in the global oil market in the
medium term, economic developments are projected to remain strong. Both the fiscal and
external current account balances are projected to register large surpluses. However, over the
medium term, pressures may build up for an increase in expenditures to address the emerging
unemployment pressures and unfunded pension liabilities.

62.
The staff recommends measures to strengthen the structure of the budget. On the
expenditure side, government employment should be contained and rewards increasingly
based on productivity. Subsidies on water and electricity should be phased out and replaced
by targeted payments to nationals below a certain income. The revenue base could be
broadened by introducing a VAT system at the Federal level and the Emirates could consider
introducing a property tax. In this connection, the staff supports the authorities request for
technical assistance from the Fund for the introduction of a VAT system.
63.
To improve fiscal policy assessment, there is an urgent need to enhance the flow
of data among the Emirates and the Federal government. The staff urges the authorities
to give high priority to improve the compilation of statistics on consolidated government
activities, the absence of which undermines the authorities’ and the staff’s ability to monitor
macroeconomic developments. Also, given the autonomy of Emirate governments in public
finance matters, the staff is of the view that better coordination in setting policy objectives
and implementation among Emirates would enhance efficiency of the overall economy.
64.
Credit conditions should be tightened to contain inflationary pressures. To this
end, consideration should be given to raising reserve requirements and tightening certain
prudential norms. However, in view of the exchange rate peg and full capital account
convertibility, the effectiveness of monetary operations in easing inflationary pressures is
likely to be limited. Thus, a further tightening of fiscal policy by targeting a lower
nonhydrocarbon fiscal deficit might be needed.
65.
The U.A.E. banking system is financially sound, well managed, and effectively
supervised. The staff commends the authorities for strengthening the prudential regulations
and supervision, including the implementation of some of the FSAP recommendations.
However, there is a need for full rationalization and consolidation of the regulatory oversight
related to the capital markets and nonfinancial bank intermediaries. Also, regulations
pertaining to investment and finance companies will need to be strengthened and gaps need
to be addressed in order to safeguard investor interests.
66.
The surge in asset prices, although partly backed by strong economic
fundamentals, is an area that warrants closer monitoring. While direct exposure of the
financial system to the equity and real estate markets remains limited, a significant increase
in credit to the private sector in 2004 might have been channeled to the equity markets. Also,
in case of a correction in the equity markets, there could be an impact on households’ balance
sheets. To this end, the staff recommends that the authorities consider higher provisioning
rates for specific types of credits, which carry higher than average risks, require higher equity
participation for real estate and margin trading loans, and enforce stricter collateral
requirements. Also, there is a need to put in place a system to start collecting information on
nonbank financial sector exposure to the real estate market.
67.
The pegged exchange rate arrangement continues to be supported by strong
economic fundamentals, prudent macroeconomic management, and sound financial
system. The strong non-oil export growth and the significant depreciation of the AED in real

- 24 -

effective terms since 2003 also indicate that competitiveness is not a problem. The staff
concurs with the authorities that the pegged exchange rate regime has served the U.A.E.
economy well and welcomes their position to remain open toward the choice of the exchange
rate regime under the planned monetary union. Since other exchange rate regimes with more
flexibility would require greater institutional development, including in foreign exchange
markets and risk management and intervention policies, staff urges the authorities to begin to
formulate strategies to develop these areas at an early stage to keep their options open.
68.
In general, the staff agrees with the authorities’ labor market strategy to
increase employment opportunities for U.A.E. nationals. This strategy should continue to
rely on raising the skills of nationals through better education and training programs geared
toward private sector labor demand, while avoiding mandatory measures, such as quotas. The
staff also recommends the implementation of labor legislation reform to provide flexibility in
hiring and firing of nationals. Also, reform of the current social benefits system to move
toward equalization of wages in the private and public sectors is needed.
69.
The staff strongly recommends that the needed budgetary resources and trained
staff be secured to improve the collection, compilation, and reporting of fiscal, national
accounts, balance of payments, and price statistics. There is also a need for the SC to
finalize the GDDS metadata prepared together with the December 2003 Multi-Sector
Mission from the Fund, and to formally nominate a GDDS coordinator. While data provision
is adequate for overall surveillance purposes, data shortcomings have significantly affected
the staff's analysis of some key issues in areas central to surveillance.
70.
It is proposed that the next Article IV consultation take place on the
standard 12-month cycle.

fixed parity. Since then, in line with commitments agreed on with other GCC countries
toward the adoption of a common currency in 2010, the U.A.E. dirham has become officially
pegged to the U.S. dollar. The mid-point between the official buying and selling rates for the
dirham has been AED 3.6725 = $1 since November 1997.

The staff has sought clarification with the authorities whether they intend to notify under Executive Board
Decision 144, measures taken in line with U.N. Security Council resolutions against terrorist financing (e.g.,
1373), as these measures may give rise to exchange restrictions subject to Fund jurisdiction. The staff is also
awaiting a notification from the authorities regarding whether restrictions on transactions with the Federal
Republic of Yugoslavia (Serbia and Montenegro) pursuant to resolutions of the U.N. Security Council have
been lifted.

APPENDIX II

United Arab Emirates: Relations with the World Bank Group
As of May 19, 2005
•

A Framework Agreement for annual technical cooperation programs was signed in
1994. It replaced the previous arrangement based on ad-hoc requests. The first
Annual Work Program of 1995–96 included two main studies—a Comprehensive
Health Assessment Study and a study to restructure Government Information
Authority, the Government’s computer center.

•

Education sector, recruitment and welfare. Three projects in these areas were
completed in 2000: Public Expenditure Review for the Education Sector; Review and
Assessment of Recruitment Procedures for the Federal government; and Analysis of
Distribution of Welfare in Abu Dhabi.

•

Environmental Assessment. In August of 2003, the U.A.E showed interest in Bank
support for a U.A.E-wide environmental assessment. A Bank needs-assessment
mission visited Dubai early this year to develop the project concept.

•

Investment Climate. In response to a request from the advisor to the Crown Prince
of Ras Al Khaimah (RAK) for assistance in the area of Foreign Investment and
Economic Development, a World Bank mission visited the Emirate late February
2004. Following discussion in RAK, the Bank team prepared TORs for the first of a
four-phase program, and agreement was signed in late March. The second phase
consisting in an assessment of the investment climate in RAK is being followed by an
Investors’ Promotion Conference in May 27–28, 2005 intended to increase awareness
that this Emirate could quickly develop as a serious contender for investment
destination.

APPENDIX III

United Arab Emirates: Statistical Issues
1.
There are numerous shortcomings in the U.A.E.’s economic and financial data. These reflect
inadequate compilation techniques, infrequent data reporting, shortage of trained staff, insufficient
resources assigned to data gathering, and poor information flow between Federal and Emirate
governments and public sector entities.20 As a result, provision of data to the Fund between
missions remains poor, except for monetary and fragmentary trade statistics. In addition, the low
frequency of official statistics—most data are produced only on an annual basis—also hampers this
provision. This appendix reviews the overall status of statistical issues by sector. Data on core
economic indicators are found in the accompanying Table.
2.
The U.A.E. has received several STA technical assistance missions over the past decade.
The 2003 STA multisector statistics mission concluded that, while the methodology used to compile
macroeconomic statistics is generally appropriate, in most sectors serious deficiencies exist. 21
These are attributable to the lack of sufficient and regular data sources in the real sector; inadequate
coordination among the data compiling agencies; and constraints from distribution of personnel and
financial resources between the Federal government and the largest Emirates. In response to the
authorities’ interest in participating in the General Data Dissemination System (GDDS), the 2003
mission worked with U.A.E. officials to prepare draft GDDS metadata, which require finalization
by the authorities. This step, together with nomination of a GDDS coordinator, and agreement by
the authorities to use the GDDS as a framework for the development of the country’s statistical
system, would complete the criteria needed for the U.A.E. to become a GDDS participant. The
U.A.E. hosted a GDDS workshop in Abu Dhabi during February 27-March 9, 2005. The authorities
have indicated that a GDDS country coordinator will be appointed shortly.
Real sector
3.
The Ministry of Economy and Planning (MOEP) compiles an annual CPI, which is
disseminated three months after the end of the reference year. A number of shortcomings exist with
respect to the methodology of the CPI, including: (i) outdated weights that are not representative for
all geographic regions; (ii) no imputations are made for missing price data; (iii) replacement product
prices are not adjusted for changes in quality; and (iv) base price and expenditure weights refer to
different periods. Because of the lack of resources, the MOPE has no short-term plans to compile
the CPI monthly. The MOEP does not currently compile a producer price index, an import price or
an export price index, which is a significant deficiency, given the role of the oil sector in the U.A.E.
4.
The MOEP compiles and disseminates annual estimates of gross domestic product (GDP) by
production and expenditure approach in current and constant 1995 prices. The national accounts
compilation system suffers from a number of deficiencies. There is no comprehensive data
collection program to provide a basis for compiling national accounts aggregates. Instead, the
existing system relies heavily on administrative and other ad-hoc data collected by Federal and
20

Key members of the remaining staff (all expatriates) are nearing retirement; questions of training and replacements
are not known to have been addressed.

21

- 37 -

APPENDIX III

Emirate institutions. The data collected are mostly quantity data. The last benchmark data available
for compiling output are from 1995, while for intermediate consumption from 1980. Basic data
remain inadequate for manufacturing, construction, wholesale and retail trade, and most of the other
service sectors. In particular, real value added for petrochemicals, which accounts for nearly half of
total manufacturing value added, is not estimated according to the 1993 SNA methodology. Instead
nominal value added is deflated by an estimated import price deflator, as is done with real
hydrocarbon value added. This methodology yields a purchasing power measure of petrochemical
output, which may result in under or overestimation of volume growth, depending on changes in
crude oil prices. Despite their importance in total GDP, oil and gas sector data are received with a
lag from the Abu Dhabi National Oil Company (ADNOC). No national household budget survey
has ever been conducted. In addition to the inadequate sources, the statistical techniques used in
compiling GDP by production and expenditure approach are not sound.
5.
Although labor statistics collected in the census are broadly in line with ILO
recommendations, there are notable divergences from ILO definitions, including inconsistency of
some concepts and irregular and incomplete updating of the census data. Lack of regular household
surveys prevents compilation of annual data on basic national labor force statistics such as wages,
unemployment, labor force and employment. Wage statistics are, for example, available only for a
small proportion of government employees.
Fiscal sector
6.
Principal deficiencies can be attributed to both the lack of coordination among the Emirates
and Federal government, and the low frequency in reporting of government financial operations.
The Ministry of Finance and Industry (MOFI) compiles data for the Federal government only.
Separate fiscal data on the Federal government and three Emirates (Abu Dhabi, Dubai, and
Sharjah), which are provided to the annual Article IV consultations, are employed by Fund staff to
provide a consolidated fiscal account for the U.A.E. An annual, “consolidated” fiscal statement is
published in the central bank’s Statistical Bulletin, which is different from the Fund staff
presentation. In particular, investment income from government assets is not included in the fiscal
account. In addition, key information, such as investment income, and expenditure under the control
of the respective Rulers’ Offices and municipalities, remains off-budget in some Emirates,
hindering comparison of fiscal developments across the Emirates and the Federal government.
International standards of economic classification of expenditure and revenue are not fully
followed.
7.
The last data reported to STA for publication in the Government Finance Statistics Yearbook
were for 1999 and covered only the Federal government. No financing information is provided by
either the Federal authorities or any of the Emirates. No sub-annual data are reported for publication
to the IMF’s International Financial Statistics (IFS). Information on pension fund activities

- 38 -

APPENDIX III

administered by the authorities through the Federal-level General Pension and Social Security
Authority (GPSSA) has been available since the 2002 consultation mission.22
Monetary sector
8.
Until recently, the principal issues in monetary statistics were limited to the classification
and sectorization of loans to the corporate, other resident, and non-resident sectors. Starting in mid2001, however, the Central Bank of the U.A.E. (CBU) change d the method for compilation of
banking data, such that deposits of U.A.E. residents booked in overseas branches/subsidiaries of
locally incorporated banks were included in the measure of broad money, and cross border flows
back to head offices were treated as “domestic.”23 The rationale behind this change, as explained by
authorities, was their observation that almost all of the funds deposited in the overseas branches (to
circumvent the reserve requirement) almost instantly found their way back into the domestic
banking system. The compilation introduced in mid-2001 does not follow internationally accepted
standards that are based on the residency principle. This compilation results in distortions in both
net foreign assets of the banking system, which are needed for the balance of payments (BOP)
accounts, and in measurement of broad money.
9.
The 2003 STA multisector mission recommended that two sets of data be compiled—a core
set for monetary reporting purposes and a supplementary data set that meets other objectives of the
authorities. The multisector mission also recommended: that lags in monetary statistics, which are
compiled monthly, but reported only quarterly, be reduced; full coverage of IMF accounts; further
sectorization of financial transactions, in particular of various Emirate government accounts, that
are currently reported in aggregate form; and further instrument classification of foreign securities
and domestic investments into bonds, shares, and other equities. During the 2005 Article IV
consultation mission the authorities indicated that they would look into publication of monetary data
based on the residency principle.
External sector
10.
Balance of payments (BOP) statistics suffer from a lack of primary data sources for most
transactions. Only one CBU staff member is assigned to BOP compilation, and cooperation from
other government agencies remains negligible. Many entries are estimates based on incomplete
information and some important transactions, such as foreign direct investment (FDI), are not
covered at all and only estimated by Fund’s staff. There are major gaps in official and private
transfers, oil companies’ service payments, private and official investment income, and financial
transactions for all sectors except banks. Progress in addressing these shortcomings continues to be
hampered by staffing limitations in the compilation unit, inadequate inter-agency cooperation, and
22

The GPSSA was established in January 1999 to provide pension and social security insurance benefits to all nationals
working in the government and the private sectors (except Abu Dhabi government employees which have their own
separate pension fund).
23

The compilation initially introduced a bias into banking statistics, especially net foreign positions of commercial
banks, of about AED 20 billion. BOP flows are also compromised, because these statistics are the source of banking
flows in the BOP accounts.

- 39 -

APPENDIX III

other restrictions on the CBU with respect to collection of data from individuals and institutions
other than the banking. The U.A.E. does not report BOP data for publication in the IMF’s IFS (with
the exception of trade statistics, which have been irregular at best), or the Balance of Payments
Statistics Yearbook (BOPSY).
11.
The authorities publish and provide data to Fund missions on banking system foreign assets.
Detailed information on central bank reserves and foreign currency liquidity is available.
Commercial bank data are also reported. These data are disseminated on a monthly basis.
Since 2000, the authorities in the Emirate of Abu Dhabi have provided to Fund staff, during
Article IV consultation missions, approximate information on the Emirate’s stock of external assets.
In the 2004 and 2005 Article IV consultations, some details on the stock of official foreign assets of
the government were provided.
12.
The authorities do not compile or publish the International Investment Position (IIP)
statement, despite ready availability of certain potential sources, such as banking and government
statistics. Also, no data on FDI or private nonfinancial sector external assets and liabilities are
collected—although, according to BIS statistics the U.A.E.’s external liabilities are relatively small.
Socio-demographic statistics
13.
The U.A.E. follows the practice of many other countries, with the Central Statistics
Department (CSD) of the MOEP taking the lead in conducting the population census and large
surveys, while line ministries collect data through their administrative reporting systems. In the area
of socio-demographic statistics, cooperation between the CSD and the various line ministries is
effective, with the CSD using data from the other ministries in its annual statistical yearbook. The
CSD also cooperates with the line ministries as needed and has provided methodological support for
the various household surveys that have been conducted. As in other countries, a population and
housing census is conducted every 10 years. Currently, the 2005 population census is in the
preparation phase. At present, no data exist on measures of income distribution, poverty and access
to basic services.

APPENDIX IV

Financial Sector Developments in the United Arab Emirates
Overview
1.
This appendix examines trends of financial soundness indicators and recent developments in
the banking system, securities and insurance markets, as well as in the payment system. In addition,
developments in legal reforms, especially in the area of anti-money laundering, are covered. An
update of the status of the follow up on the recommendations of the FSAP mission in 2001 is also
assessed.
Banking sector
2.
The banking sector in United Arab Emirates remains sound, bolstered by strong
supervision, and a vibrant economy. The overall ratio of capital to risk-weighted assets (CAR)
declined slightly to just under 17 percent from 19 percent in 2003 as banks increased their lending
activity to profit from the economic expansion. Nonetheless, CAR remained well above the
regulatory prudential norm of 10 percent. The official ratio of nonperforming loans (NPLs) to total
loans remained somewhat high at 12.5 percent at end-200424, but a substantial increase in
provisioning from 89 percent to 95 percent reduced the ratio of NPLs net of provisions to
3.6 percent. Banks reported that very few loans made recently had become nonperforming.
3.
The banking sector activities expanded significantly during 2004. Deposits grew by
25 percent and lending, which was broad-based, grew by 25.5 percent. Bank profitability was
enhanced by an increase mainly in interest income. Return on assets increased from 1.9 percent
in 2003 to 2.1 percent in 2004, and return on equity increased from 16 percent to 20 percent.
4.
Banks in the U.A.E. do not appear to be exposed to currency risks, and interest rate
mismatches are small. While banks have a substantial long dollar positions, foreign exchange risks
are limited by the government’s credible commitment to the dollar peg and the limited non-dollar
exposures. Longer-term fixed rate lending is not well-developed, limiting interest rate mismatches.
Loan quality was enhanced by the CBU’s implementation of risk-based supervision in 2002, which
required banks to implement policies to mitigate credit, operational risks, and market risks.
5.
Direct exposure to the booming real estate sector appeared to be minimal at end-2004.
Banks’ direct lending to the real estate as a share of total loans declined to 4.7 percent from
5.4 percent in 2003. Many real estate buyers make full payments in cash, and banks are generally
reluctant to lend more than 70 percent of the value of the property. Lending to the construction
sector grew by 18 percent during 2004, though as a percent of total lending it declined to
12.8 percent from 13.6 percent.

24

Most of these loans are loans from the 1980s and early 1990s that remain in the books because of laws that do not
allow for the writing off of loans as long as there is a chance that they will be repaid.

- 42 -

APPENDIX IV

Monetary operations
6.
The certificates of deposits (CDs) continued to be the main monetary instrument used
by the CBU to smooth out fluctuations in domestic liquidity. CDs are issued up to 18 months
maturity, and the CBU can buy them back upon banks’ request at a penalty rate. In 2004, the CBU
increased its issuance of CDs by about 35 percent and the total stock of outstanding CDs was raised
to about AED 16 billion. The CBU plans to extend CD maturities from the current 18 months to
60 months and to begin conducting repo operations based on these instruments.
Securities
7.
The U.A.E. securities markets, the Abu Dhabi Securities Market (ADSM) and the
Dubai Securities Market (DSM), have witnessed significant growth since their inceptions
in 2001. Total market capitalization tripled to slightly over $82 billion, while the cumulative value
of the shares traded increased from $2 billion in 2003 to $18 billion in 2004. The composite P/E
ratio for both the ADSM and DSM increased from 18 percent to 31 percent during the same period.
The composite index of the two markets increased by 88 percent in 2004, after having increased by
32 percent in 2003.25
8.
The CBU has established clear guidelines on the exposure of banks to the securities
market. These included: (i) a limit on bank’s investment or lending for investment purposes in one
company to less than 7 percent of own capital; and (ii) a limit on investment in commercial
companies to less than 25 percent of own total capital.
9.
The nonbank financial sector is expanding rapidly. As of end-2004, there were
218 nonbank financial institutions (NBFIs) operating in the U.A.E., including 7 investment
companies, 7 finance companies, 110 moneychangers, 50 representative offices of foreign nonbank
financial institutions, 32 monetary and financial intermediaries, such as brokers and 12 financial
consultants. Of the 7 investment companies, 2 are branches of foreign banking groups, and the rest
are independent companies and are not related to banking institutions.
10.
The CBU currently licenses, regulates, and supervises all nonbank financial
institutions. Investment companies may conduct one or more of the following businesses: (i) open
investment accounts and manage portfolios on behalf of individuals or companies; (ii) prepare
feasibility studies for projects, market allotments, and traded companies; (iii) establish or manage
investment trust funds; (iv) establish and/or manage other investment funds; and (v) underwrite
capital of companies and syndicated loans.
11.
The Dubai International Financial Center (DIFC) began operations in
September 2004. As of mid-March 2005, 11 financial institutions have been granted licenses to
operate within the free zone. It is expected that this number will rise to about 50 by end-year.
Considerable progress has been made with respect to the regulatory framework governing the
DIFC, and an extensive set of laws has been created based on best international practices. By
25

As of mid-May, the composite index of the U.A.E. increased by over 75.

- 43 -

APPENDIX IV

design, the DIFC is intended to be segregated from the financial center of the U.A.E. Banking
operations are confined to institutional wholesale banking, with both deposit taking and lending in
dirham prohibited.
12.
The DIFC is well established and has the potential to become a major international
financial center. The unique nature of the governance relationships involved, and the broad scope
of its activities raise some concern about what risks are being created and what effects, if any, it
may have on the monetary system of the U.A.E.. The authorities in the U.A.E. and DIFC agreed
with the mission that it would be useful to have the operations and regulatory arrangements of the
DIFC assessed by the Fund. Such a mission could potentially take place in late 2005 or early 2006.
13.
Progress continues on the drafting of a new banking law, company law, and law on
land ownership. There is still a need to rationalize and consolidate regulatory oversight, and the
CBU and ESCA will need to coordinate closely to ensure that a comprehensive supervisory
framework for the entire financial sector is in place. The regulatory and supervisory responsibilities
for IPOs currently rest with the MOEP, but these should be transferred to ESCA as its capacity is
strengthened. Considerations could also be given to transferring the supervision of investment
companies and mutual funds from the CBU to ESCA. The authorities agreed with the mission’s
recommendation that they request a Reports on Standards and Codes (ROSC) mission, from the
Fund, which was not conducted during the 2001 FSAP.
Anti-money laundering
14.
Major steps have been taken to put in place a strong legal framework to prevent
money laundering and financing of terrorist activities. In this connection, two laws were passed
in 2004; one on dealing with financing of terrorism and the other addressing AML/CFT issues in
the financial free zones. A law criminalizing money laundering that was adopted in 2002 has been
widely cited as a model of best practices. Hawala dealers continue to voluntarily register and have
been certified by the CBU. They are required to report on quarterly basis to the CBU their
transaction records on transactions exceeding AED 2,000 ($550). As of end-February 2005, the
CBU has received 156 registration applications and 133 certificates have been issued.
Islamic Banking
15.
Islamic banking has expanded in U.A.E. in recent years. In 2004 the number of Islamic
banks doubled to 4 and their assets increased by 35 percent, versus 22 percent for total assets of the
banking system. By end-2004, 13 percent of deposits and 10 percent of all bank assets were held by
Islamic banks.
16.
The central bank does not apply separate accounting standards to Islamic Banks. There
are no explicit Sharia-compliant instruments with which the central bank could provide emergency
liquidity support. However, the central bank has indicated that the 7-day overdraft facility available

- 44 -

APPENDIX IV

to all banks could be extended for more than 7 days and the penalty rate could be waived, if
needed.26
Insurance
17.
Improvements in insurance oversight are ongoing, but a comprehensive study of the
insurance law and regulations has not been undertaken. An independent Supervision and
Oversight Commission for supervision of insurance is being established and the relevant MOEP
staff will move to this new authority once it is set up. A ministerial decree has been issued to allow
foreign entry into the insurance market. The staff of the insurance division at the MOEP was
increased from 10 to 17 in 2004.
18.
Various amendments to the Insurance law have been proposed by the MOEP. Among
these are: (i) new rules on risk allocation and financial solvency margins that bring technical
specifications in line with international good practices; (ii) empowerment of the council of
Ministers to establish a fund to guarantee contracts to policy holders and beneficiaries; and (iii) a
possible removal of the ban on foreign equity participation in insurance companies by allowing up
to 49 percent foreign ownership.
Payment system
19.
The real time gross settlements interbank payment system has been expanded to all
banks and telexes are no longer used for any transactions. The settlement system is still based
on T+1, but this will change to T+0 when the image-based check clearing system is introduced
in 2005.
20.
The CBU still grants overdrafts to banks, but these overdrafts are no longer made in
excess of the reserve account balance. Overdrafts are repayable within six days and incur a
penalty rate of 5 percent over the 3 month interbank rate. The authority to extend these overdrafts
comes from a law that says the Central Bank can make loans and advances of 7 days without
collateral.

26

Under the overdraft facility, banks borrow against their reserves, including required reserves at a penalty rate for up
to 7 days.

APPENDIX IV

FSAP recommendations
21.
The ESCA substantially strengthened the supervision of securities by increasing its staff
and providing those staff with training. Important steps have been taken to automate banking,
securities transactions, and the payment system. Transparency has been strengthened by publishing
some major laws and circulars on the internet and by maintaining a continuous two way dialogue
with banks on supervision and laws and regulations.
22.
There has been progress on legal reforms, but this needs to keep pace with financial
sector development. The legal and regulatory framework remains fragmented and unclear in some
areas, and could become problematic as the financial sector becomes more complex. The authorities
are aware of this issue and are actively addressing it.
Table 2: Update of FSAP Recommendations

Recommendation

Status

Banking Supervision
(1) The supervision of groups containing both
banks, insurance companies and securities firms
should be enhanced by having regular contact
between the CBU and insurance supervisor and
securities regulator, and by ensuring that the CBU
has assured access to the prudential returns of
insurance companies in such groups. (Core
Principle (CP) 1(6)).

Still under discussion.

(2) The new securities legislation requires the CBU
to pre-approve holdings in listed banks exceeding
5 percent. Procedures for such pre-approvals
should be established within the CBU. The
principle of pre-approval should also be extended
to non-listed banks. (CP 4)

Partial progress.

(3) The CBU should issue guidelines or circulars
requiring banks to have adequate policies and
procedures for the identification, measurement and
control of market risk (CP 12) and should introduce
explicit requirements for banks to have a
comprehensive risk management process to
identify, measure and control material risks.
(CP 13) (A pilot study on risk-based supervision
that is now under way, may establish the basis for
the CBU providing guidance in these areas.)

Informal progress only.

A dialog is ongoing to determine how best to
address this recommendation

There are no procedures to pre-approve holdings
in listed banks in excess of 5 percent. The draft
banking law extends the principle of pre-approval
to non-listed banks.

No guidelines or circulars have been issued to
address market risk in this context or require
banks to have a comprehensive risk management
process. However the CBU is in the third year of
its risk-based supervision, in which they examine
a bank’s credit risk, operational risk, and market
risk and how the bank implements policies to
address them.

- 47 -

Recommendation

APPENDIX IV

Status
The CBU has assigned staff to look at drafting
such circulars. They are expected to be
distributed in the context of the implementation
of Basle II.

(4) Off-balance sheet items and inter-bank
exposures to U.A.E. banks with maturities of less
than 12 months should be included in the definition
of large exposures. (CP 9)

Awaiting implementation of Basle II.

(5) Members of a bank’s staff who report
suspicious transactions in good faith to the
compliance officer of the CBU should be protected
from being held liable (protection is included in the
draft Banking Law). (CP 15)

Completed

This issue is most relevant in the case of import
guarantees and guarantees for large construction
projects. In the case of import guarantees, the
authorities indicate that the banks would be
protected because they could seize control of the
goods in case of nonpayment. In the case of
construction, the banks are partly protected by
the practice of requiring certification before any
contractor receives a payment, and enforcing this
restriction would be infeasible since it would
create a major obstacle to development in the
construction industry.

Federal Law no. 4 of 2002 (regarding the
criminalization of money laundering), Article 20
addresses this.

Securities
(1) Work to eliminate the current state of market
confusion which exists as a result of the
Authority’s delay in fully commencing operations.

Completed

(2) Rationalize the regulatory responsibilities of the
ESCA, the CBU, the MOEP, and the securities
markets as soon as possible, and effectively
communicate the results to the markets.

Groundwork has been laid.

ESCA is fully operational

There is an expectation that ESCA will gradually
undertake more responsibilities, but this shift
cannot take place until the ESCA builds up its
staff and capacity, which is an ongoing process.
There has been discussion of creating a
supervisory authority that would cover all types
of securities regulation, but no action has been
taken.
Under the law the ESCA has supervisory
responsibility for brokerage houses, listed
companies, and the two stock exchanges. It
should also have responsibility for investment

companies, mutual funds, IPOs, and
nongovernment pension funds (which do not yet
exist, but are envisioned). An ordinary broker
may only deal with U.A.E. listed securities. A
broker who wants also to deal with international
securities has to be licensed by the Central Bank.

(3) The ESCA should expeditiously commence its
staffing exercise (the adequacy of qualified staff
will greatly enhance the perception of market
integrity).

Good and ongoing progress.

(4) The two securities exchanges (Abu Dhabi and
Dubai) should establish an electronic
trading/clearing linkage as required under the law
as soon as possible (this will contribute to both
market efficiency and integrity).

Completed

(5) Significant effort should be expended to
develop the corporate debt market and increase the
participation of nonbank financial institutions such
as pension funds, insurance companies, and mutual
funds.

Progress is underway.

(6) Improvements should be made to the corporate
governance environment including minority
shareholder protections.

Progress is underway.

Increases in staffing and training have been
ongoing. Last year the number of staff increased
by 50 percent. Training is provided locally, in the
GCC region, and outside the region. In March
MOUs were signed with Australia and Malaysia
to exchange expertise.

There is an electronic trading linkage. There is no
clearing linkage, but according to the authorities
this is not required by the law. Companies are not
cross listed on the exchanges. There are plans to
completely merge the two exchanges. Both
exchanges now settle on a T+2 basis.

The ESCA plans shortly to issue a set of rules on
the listing of bonds. A committee that includes
all banks in the region has been established to
develop bond markets in the region. The program
is due to be completed within two years. There
are currently two bonds listed on the DFM,
Emirates Airlines, and the Government of Dubai.

A new set of rules on corporate governance is
expected to be presented to the board of ESCA in
April 2005. These rules will cover minority
shareholder protections and insider trading. The
new company law will also address governance
issues.

APPENDIX IV

Status
All banks reported that they have good, continual
communication with the CBU. Whenever
changes in laws, regulations, technical
requirements, or policies are contemplated their
input is sought.

Legal reforms
(1) Enact the proposed amendments to the
companies legislation and make provision for
improved minority shareholder rights, better
corporate governance provisions and simplified
company formation procedures. Improve operation
of and accessibility to the Company Register.

Progress is underway.

(2) Improve registration procedures for movable

of non-possessory pledges.

Good and ongoing progress.

(3) Simplify the law relating to the ownership,
transfer, and charging of real estate. Improve
operation of the Land Registry and make it freely
and fully accessible to the public.

Good and ongoing progress.

(4) Enact the proposed amendments to the Banking
Law, including the proposed anti money laundering
provisions.

Good and ongoing progress.

(5) Consider introducing an accelerated and
simplified procedure for the handling of small
value claims, e.g., claims under AED 50,000.

No progress.

The authorities are currently drafting a new
banking law and a new company law, both of
which address corporate governance and
minority shareholder rights.

Registration procedures for many types of
movable property have been improved. No
information was provided on non-possessory
pledges.

Foreigners are now allowed to own land in Dubai
and there are plans to allow this in all the
Emirates. The Land Registry is freely available
and fully accessible to the public.

Several key laws have been passed, including
Federal law #4 of 2002 on anti-money
laundering, Federal Law #1 of 2004 which
addresses combating the financing of terrorism,
and Federal Law #8 of 2004 which addresses
AML/CFT in the financial free zone. Work
continues on the new banking law, which has not
yet been enacted.

APPENDIX IV

Recommendation

Status

Insurance

Good and ongoing progress.

(1) Increasing the staff of the Insurance Division of
MOEP to include more individuals who possess the
skills necessary to carry out off-site analyses and
on-site inspections. In addition, an appropriate
official should be appointed as the U.A.E.
Insurance Commissioner.

There is an ongoing process of hiring and
training new staff. Recently seven new staff have
been hired, bringing the total staff to 17.

(2) Carrying out a full review of the insurance law
and regulations with a view to bringing it up to
current best practice, while allowing for the unique
U.A.E. context. In the interim the proposed
amendments to the insurance law should probably
be held back. In particular a formal study of the
capital requirements and investment risks for
foreign branches is highly desirable.

Partial and ongoing progress.

(3) Reviewing the constraints inhibiting industry
rationalization, with a view to making it more
desirable for domestic companies, and easier for
foreign branches to merge. In addition, where
insurers are engaged in regional rather than local
market activities there may be grounds for easing
the rules on work visas and other requirements for
non-nationals, although this would have to be
tightly monitored.

Progress is unclear.

(4) Developing a deeper and more liquid market for
local property and securities by allowing some
portfolio investment in key sectors by foreign
insurers operating in the domestic market. This
would encourage further development of local
currency denominated investment and savings
products, including Takaful. To ensure local
participation in a growing life insurance industry
joint ventures could be allowed (or required), for
foreign involvement in local markets.

Limited progress.

The creation of an independent authority for the
supervision of insurance—which it was hoped
would be completed by end-2004—is stillenvisioned. Once a new Authority is in place the
relevant staff of the MOEP would be transferred
to it.

No comprehensive study of the insurance law
and regulations has taken place. However,
gradual improvements have been ongoing. Two
Ministerial decrees have been issued in recent
years; one to improve transparency, and another
to allow foreign entry into the insurance market.
Amendments to the law in order to bring it into
line with international standards are still
envisioned.

No specific legislation has been enacted. Review
of constraints to rationalization or work visas has
taken place only at a low level.

There has been no specific progress on
legislation. Publicly traded companies have
gradually been allowing more foreign
investment, though this is at their initiative. The
upcoming free trade agreement with the United
States and compliance with the WTO will require
greater openness.

Recommendation

APPENDIX IV

Status

Payment system
(1) The CBU should review its procedures for
providing overdrafts and implement a system
whereby the CBU only lends to banks against
proper collateral. Publication of its overdraft
procedures could also be considered.

Partial progress.
Lending is still made without requiring proper
collateral, but the amount of the loan cannot
exceed reserves on deposit with the CBU, so the
loan can be recovered by seizing required
reserves. Such loans are for a maximum of six
days and a penalty interest of five percent over
the three-month interbank rate is applied.
These rules for overdrafts are publicly disclosed
in a circular on the internet. The amounts of the
overdrafts are not publicly disclosed.

(2) To prepare for increases in transaction volume
and reduce reliance on manual procedures, the
CBU should consider greater automation and
computerization of the existing systems. In the
interim, it could also consider limiting the value of
different types of transfers—a minimum amount
for a Telex Transfer and a maximum amount for a
check.

Completed.

(3) In the medium term, a move to a more
advanced automatic system that would give the
payment system both increased capacity and
greater protection from operational risks. This
might include moving from a T+1 system for check
settlement to same day settlement. Consideration
should also be given to the risks involved with the
introduction of the new real time gross settlement
system that would replace the Telex Testkey
System.

Good progress.

Automation and computerization have moved
forward at a fast pace. Telexes are no longer used
for any transfers. All transfers are made
electronically and there is no need for any limits
on different types of transfers.

Automation and computerization have been
expanded. Telexes are no longer used for any
transfers. Settlement system is still T+1, but this
will change when the image-based check clearing
system is introduced 2005.

Statement by A. Shakour Shaalan, Executive Director for the United Arab Emirates
July 1, 2005

1.
At the outset, we wish to express on behalf of the authorities our thanks to the staff
for a constructive consultation process and for the well-balanced advice reflected in the
rigorous set of reports before us. The authorities are in broad agreement with the thrust of the
analysis and policy recommendations contained in the staff report.
Recent Economic Developments
2.
The U.A.E. economy continued to perform strongly in 2004, underpinned by
favorable oil market developments and a commitment to an outward-oriented and businessfriendly strategy. Although hydrocarbon revenues continue to play a dominant role in the
economy, the authorities have firmly pursued an aggressive strategy to optimally utilize oil
resources to intensify economic diversification and strengthen private sector activity in the
non-oil sector. The dividends of this strategy are reflected in a robust economic growth, with
non-oil growth remaining strong at 10 percent supported by the boom in the manufacturing,
services and construction sectors, as well as increased non-oil exports and a healthy surplus
on the current account of 12 percent of GDP. With a streamlined regulatory environment,
buttressed by liberal employment policies and an advanced infrastructure, the U.A.E.
emerged as one of the most competitive economies at the regional and, to a large extent,
global levels. Bolstered by strong economic fundamentals, investor confidence was reflected
in a boost in FDI inflows and a surge in equity markets. Economic activity further
accelerated, as the economy generated an average of 177,000 jobs per year (almost ten times
the annual increment to its national labor force), at a time when other economies were
shedding them. Inflation edged up to 4.6 percent in tandem with the surge in economic
activity.
3.
The medium-term outlook for the economy is promising. Given the momentum in
private sector activity and the favorable outlook for oil prices, the overall fiscal position
remains resilient to shocks in oil prices as low as $23 per barrel. Looking ahead, to reinforce
the role of the U.A.E. in stabilizing global prices and supply of oil, the authorities are now
embarking on huge investment projects with the aim of increasing production capacity to
3.5 mbd by 2006 and to 4.0 mbd in the longer term. Concurrently, the authorities have taken
initiatives to tap into their vast resources of natural gas to reduce the reliance of the non-oil
sector on changes in oil. The expectation is for natural gas production to fulfill the domestic
demand for energy, especially in manufacturing, and to release more oil for exports.
Fiscal Policy
4.
Guided by conservative assumptions about oil prices, fiscal policy in the U.A.E. is
crafted to maintain fiscal sustainability over the medium term while implicitly ensuring intergenerational equity. Saving for future generations is essentially achieved through the large
accumulation of foreign assets from surpluses on oil revenues by the government of

-2-

Abu Dhabi. With higher oil revenues and a prudent expenditure policy, the consolidated
fiscal position strengthened considerably, registering a surplus of over 18 percent of GDP,
and the non-hydrocarbon deficit continued to narrow.
5.
To consolidate the fiscal gains from oil revenues and further stimulate expansion of
the non-hydrocarbon sector, the authorities are pursuing measures to enhance fiscal
performance on two fronts: improving the budget structure and strengthening fiscal
coordination among the Emirates. Regarding the budget structure, public expenditure
management has been improved at the Federal level with the introduction of performancebased budgeting. In Abu Dhabi, reforms have been initiated to enhance the composition and
quality of current spending. Agricultural and utility subsidies continue to decline, and one
power plant has been privatized as part of the broader divestiture plan of the water and power
sectors by 2006. Measures to rationalize the wage bill were also taken, notably through
scaling back civil service employment and outsourcing certain services to the private sector.
The authorities are cognizant of the concerns expressed by staff regarding the recent wage
increase and its implications on domestic demand and employment. However, given the
structural shift in oil prices and the limited fiscal impact of this measure, the authorities
deemed it opportune to transfer part of the windfall to the population. In the period ahead, the
authorities will remain vigilant to tighten financial policies should inflationary pressures
emerge and continue with their active labor market policies to improve employability of their
nationals. On the revenue side, measures to expand the revenue base are pursued.
Specifically, deliberations are now underway to introduce a value-added tax (VAT), with the
potential of eventual harmonization at the GCC level. The authorities have requested the
Fund’s technical assistance in this regard.
6.
Given the current legal set up which grants considerable autonomy to the individual
Emirates, the authorities are keenly aware of the importance of stronger coordination and
harmonization of fiscal accounting among the Emirates, especially in the run-up to the GCC
union. To this end, a new economic planning committee has been formed at the Federal level,
with the objective of establishing a framework to guide and coordinate economic policy and
statistics. This framework is expected to improve fiscal policy assessment and ensure
consistency of policies at the Emirate level with the overall macroeconomic objectives.
Monetary Policy and the External Sector
7.
Supported by a strengthened foreign asset position and sound financial policies, the
pegged exchange rate system continues to serve the U.A.E. economy well. The cumulative
appreciation since 1990, while partly mitigated by the recent real depreciation, does not
appear to have affected overall competitiveness of the economy.
8.
With the capital account being fully convertible, monetary policy relies on a prudent
credit stance to smooth out domestic liquidity and support the peg. In view of the rapid
growth in private sector credit and the emerging inflationary pressures, the Central Bank of
U.A.E. (CBU) stands ready to tighten credit conditions if needed through an increase in the
reserve requirements on demand deposits. The CBU further intends to extend the maturity of

-3-

the certificates of deposits (CDs) issued, with the objective of expanding its range of
instruments in managing liquidity and developing a CD-based repo market.
9.
Recognizing the important role of trade openness and economic integration in
catalyzing the diversification process, the authorities have intensified their efforts towards
regional and global integration. At the regional level, deliberations are ongoing among GCC
member countries on convergence criteria in the run-up to the monetary union. Specifically,
five convergence criteria were discussed by the governors of the respective monetary
authorities, including targets on inflation rates, short-term interest rates, foreign exchange
reserves, as well as fiscal deficit and public debt ratios. In pursuing liberalization beyond the
regional context, the authorities remain mindful of the principles of the GCC customs union.
A Trade and Investment Framework Agreement (TIFA) with the U.S. was recently signed,
boding well for the country’s efforts to further strengthen its global relations.
Financial Sector Issues
10.
The financial sector in the U.A.E. remains sound and its role as a regional hub
continues to evolve. The banking sector is strong, well-capitalized and highly profitable, with
prudential and oversight regulations being continuously strengthened. Despite a rapid growth
in private sector credit, sound lending practices have effectively limited the exposure of the
banking sector to the real estate boom. With limits set on the property value amenable to
bank financing, total lending to real estate activities remained confined to less than five
percent of total lending portfolio. The CBU has also intensified its efforts to reinforce
existing regulations regarding the financing of IPOs, to safeguard the banking sector from
excessive exposure to asset market risk.
11.
Increased investor confidence, on the back of strong fundamentals, contributed to a
boost in equity markets and a surge in asset prices, which appears to be a common
phenomenon among emerging markets. The composite index of the Abu Dhabi and Dubai
securities markets registered the highest growth among the GCC markets and market
capitalization almost doubled. Furthermore, the regulatory and supervisory structures of the
securities markets continue to be strengthened. To this end, the Emirate Securities and
Commodities Authorities (ESCA) has been activated and its operations are being supported
through increased employment and training of its staff. Transparency of the system has also
been enhanced through several measures, including the establishment of a clear and detailed
set of requirements for listing and disclosure. The authorities concur with staff on the
importance of establishing a consolidated supervisory framework for the capital markets and
the non-bank financial intermediaries. Fund assistance in the form of a Report on Standards
and Codes (ROSC) has been requested to help lay the groundwork in this regard.
12.
Progress has also been achieved in tightening regulations against money laundering
and in strengthening the regulatory capability of the Dubai International Financial Center
(DIFC). Two new laws were promulgated in 2004 addressing the financing of terrorism and
AML/FATF issues in the free zones. With Dubai vying to become a major regional financial
hub, the authorities have promptly established the regulatory framework for the DIFC in line
with international best practice, in order to support the growing number of licensed financial

-4-

institutions. Given the specific structure and arrangements governing its activities, the
authorities have agreed to a review of the DIFC’s operations by the Fund within year-end.
Structural Policies
13.
The authorities’ development strategy has focused on strengthening the investment
competitiveness of the economy while according a prominent role to the private sector in
leading growth in non-hydrocarbon activities. An investor-friendly environment was fostered
through an efficient and modern infrastructure, a streamlined regulatory climate in
production and employment, and a favorable attitude towards foreign ownership. These
factors have reinforced the ‘efficiency premium’ of the U.A.E. economy, rendering it an
attractive destination for FDI and a regional hub for a large number of international
companies that cater to neighboring markets.
14.
To intensify competitiveness and strengthen the investment climate, the authorities
are advancing on several initiatives. An amended Commercial Company Law that extends
foreign ownership beyond the current limit of 49 percent is currently being considered by the
cabinet for approval. Additionally, and in line with staff recommendation, the authorities are
considering a new FDI legislation that would ensure consistency of regulations across the
Federation while allowing flexibility in economic policy at the Emirate level. Moreover, the
Dubai International Arbitration Center (DIAC) has been established to improve settlement of
business disputes and address weaknesses in investor protection and contract enforcement.
Finally, to improve system disclosure, the Dubai Chamber of Commerce and Investment
(CCI) is in the process of establishing a credit rating and reporting agency, with international
affiliation and federation-wide jurisdiction.
15.
The authorities are cognizant of the importance of generating productive employment
opportunities for the growing national labor force. Their strategy has focused on measures to
enhance the employability of nationals in the private sector without compromising the overall
competitiveness of the economy. To this end, and in addition to various initiatives to promote
entrepreneurship at the Emirate level, a national training agency has been established to
better equip nationals for private sector employment. Furthermore, as part of the authorities’
longer-term plans to improve the incentive structure and reduce the wedge between public
and private sector wages and benefits, a pension scheme for nationals in both the public and
private sectors has been adopted.
Statistical Issues
16.
The authorities are aware of the importance—and urgency—of upgrading the
economic and statistical database. Several measures to improve the institutional statistical
framework governing the flow of information among the Emirates were initiated to this end.
In addition to enhancing the role of the inter-ministerial Statistical Committee, the authorities
have expressed interest in participating in General Data Dissemination System (GDDS) and
have identified a coordinator at the Ministry of Planning and Economy. They are now
preparing for the 2005 population census, which is expected to lay the statistical foundation

-5-

for the implementation of several sectoral surveys in the future, including household budget
surveys and business establishment surveys.
Conclusion
17.
The authorities are thankful to the Fund for the provision of valuable technical
assistance. In the period ahead, they will remain vigilant to deal with any domestic price
pressures that may emerge, and focus their efforts on confronting the challenges that may
arise in the process of meeting the GCC convergence criteria.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

International Monetary Fund
700 19th Street, NW
Washington, D. C. 20431 USA

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2005 Article IV Consultation with
the United Arab Emirates
On July 1, 2005, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded the
Article IV consultation with the United Arab Emirates.1
Background
An outward-oriented development strategy, a good record in macroeconomic management, and
a business friendly environment have resulted in impressive economic growth in the U.A.E. over
the years. Economic diversification has advanced rapidly, supported by an increasing role of the
private sector, which has laid the foundation for further economic and social progress in the
period ahead.
Reflecting sharply higher oil prices and increased oil production, strong investor confidence, and
a significant increase in foreign direct investment (FDI), economic growth in the U.A.E. is
estimated to have been very strong in 2004. Preliminary data for 2004 indicate that the real nonhydrocarbon GDP grew at 10 percent, while hydrocarbon production rose 3 percent. Growth
was broad based with most sub-sectors growing at historically high rates, with manufacturing
leading the way, followed by services and construction. The depreciation of the U.A.E. dirham
(AED) in real effective terms and strong economic growth in the U.A.E.’s export markets helped
drive faster growth in manufactured exports. Both the external current account and consolidated
fiscal balances are estimated to have recorded large surpluses in 2004 of 12 percent and
18.3 percent of GDP, respectively. The non-hydrocarbon deficit (excluding investment income)
narrowed by about 5 percentage points of non-hydrocarbon GDP, to about 27.5 percent. Asset
prices in the real estate and the stock markets have soared, aided by stronger economic
1

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies.
On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the
Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the
Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the
country's authorities.

-2fundamentals and investor optimism. The composite equity market index rose by 88 percent in
2004. Net FDI is estimated to have reached US$9 billion. The broad money stock rose by
23 percent, mainly on account of an increase in private sector credit.
The banking sector in the U.A.E remains strong, bolstered by effective supervision. Overall, the
capital-assets ratio (CAR) declined slightly to just under 17 percent, as banks increased their
lending activities, but remains well above prudential norms for all banks. At end-2004, while the
official ratio of non-performing loans (NPL) to total loans remained somewhat high at
12.5 percent, provisions were considerable, bringing the net NPL ratio below 4 percent. Banks’
exposure to the booming real estate sector has so far been limited. Information on the non-bank
financial sector exposure to the real estate sector is not available. The U.A.E. authorities,
including the Emirate and Securities and Commodities Authority (ESCA) have undertaken steps
to continue to strengthen supervision of securities and non-bank financial institutions. Major
steps have been taken to put in place a strong legal framework to prevent money laundering
and financing of terrorist activities. Two laws were passed in 2004, one on dealing with
financing of terrorism and the other addressing AML/CFT issues in the financial free zones.
The Dubai International Financial Center (DIFC) began operations in September 2004.
Considerable progress has been made with respect to the regulatory framework governing the
DIFC, and an extensive set of laws has been established based on best international practices.
The pace of liberalization gained momentum, in particular in Dubai, and to a lesser extent in the
other Emirates. Dubai’s policy of extending foreign ownership of land and properties for real
estate developments have resulted in a construction boom and a significant increase in FDI in
this sector. Sharjah has also established a number of industrial free zones while the
privatization of Abu Dhabi’s utilities sector is proceeding as planned with one power plant being
sold to private investors. Consideration is being given in Abu Dhabi to follow Dubai’s example of
relaxing government control over the real estate market. The Federal government continues to
play an important role in the federation, taking the lead in public administration reforms by
implementing a range of reforms including performance-based budgeting and setting up a
modern treasury system.
The U.A.E.’s general policy has been to avoid imposing wide-ranging employment quotas for
nationals as it recognizes the significance of expatriate labor’s contribution to growth and to
maintaining the competitiveness of the economy. However, given the rising unemployment
among nationals, a string of new measures have been implemented in recent years which
include raising the cost associated with hiring expatriate workers. The authorities are also taking
measures to create employment opportunities for the U.A.E. nationals in the private sector.
These measures include programs for training and job placement to match the needs of the
private sector, entrepreneurship programs that provide funds at low rates to nationals for them
to start their own businesses, and enactment of a pension plan for nationals working in the
private sector in a plan equivalent to that which applies to the public sector.
Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors agreed with the thrust of the staff appraisal. They commended the
authorities of the U.A.E. for pursuing an outward-oriented development strategy and prudent
macroeconomic policies, which have led to impressive economic growth, rapid development of
the non-oil economy, and a sizable accumulation of foreign assets. They welcomed the

-3continued progress in diversifying the economy and the implementation of structural reforms,
which have enhanced the economy’s resilience to external shocks.
Directors agreed that the medium-term outlook remains favorable and that the U.A.E. is in a
good position to consolidate the recent gains from the high oil prices. They underscored,
however, that soaring assets prices and emerging inflationary pressures warrant close
monitoring. The sustainability of the U.A.E.’s growth prospects hinges on continued
implementation of structural reforms and maintaining financial stability. Directors called on the
authorities to promote private investment by lifting remaining impediments to foreign
investments outside the free zones, and enhance the long-run employability of the national
labor force through training and education.
Directors welcomed the authorities’ prudent fiscal stance, as reflected in the narrowing of the
non-hydrocarbon fiscal deficit and projected improvement in the overall fiscal balance. At the
same time, they pointed to the need for greater fiscal policy coordination between the individual
Emirates and the Federal government, standardized accounting systems, and an improved flow
of data between the levels of government. They considered that the structure of the budget
should be further strengthened by containing government employment and basing the civil
service rewards system on productivity. Subsidies on water and electricity should also be
phased out, and replaced by targeted payments to nationals below a certain income level.
Directors welcomed the continued reduction in agricultural subsidies in the Emirate of Abu
Dhabi.
Directors recommended that the revenue base be broadened to reduce reliance on oil and gas
revenues, including by introducing a local property tax and a value-added tax, the latter in
coordination with other members of the Gulf Cooperation Council. They supported the
authorities’ request for technical assistance from the Fund for the introduction of a VAT.
Directors commented that efforts should also be made to strengthen the institutional capacity of
tax administration.
Directors considered that the pegged exchange rate arrangement continues to be supported by
strong economic fundamentals and sound financial policies, and provides an anchor for price
stability and market confidence. They welcomed the authorities’ open-mindedness as to the
choice of exchange rate regime under the planned GCC monetary union, but cautioned that
more flexible exchange rate regimes require greater institutional development of the foreign
exchange markets, and well-defined risk management and intervention policies. They therefore
recommended that the authorities formulate strategies in these areas at an early stage.
Directors considered that monetary policy remains appropriately geared to containing inflation.
While recent increases in asset prices are attributable in part to strong economic fundamentals,
the authorities were nevertheless urged to closely monitor equity and real estate markets and to
tighten financial conditions if warranted. The authorities could consider higher provisioning rates
for credits carrying greater-than-average risks, increasing the minimum amount of equity
needed for approval of real estate and margin trading loans, and tightening collateral
requirements.
Directors stressed that a system for collecting information on non-bank financial sector
exposure to the real state market is needed.
Directors agreed that the financial sector in the U.A.E. remains sound and its role as a regional

-4hub continues to evolve. They commended the authorities for the progress achieved in
improving financial sector supervision. At the same time, they highlighted the need for
rationalization and consolidation of regulatory oversight of the capital markets and nonbank
financial intermediaries. Effective coordination between the central bank and the Emirate
Security and Commodity Authority is needed to ensure that a comprehensive supervisory
framework is in place for the entire financial sector. Directors supported efforts to develop a
regulatory framework for the Dubai International Financial Center, and welcomed the
authorities’ agreement to have the Fund assess the Center’s structure and operations by
year-end. Directors commended the authorities for the work on a legal framework to prevent
money laundering and the financing of terrorism.
Directors encouraged the authorities to broaden the scope of the investment regime outside the
free zones and enhance its transparency. In this vein, they welcomed the authorities’ effort in
pursuing new foreign direct investment legislation and an amendment to the Commercial
Company law, which would further the development of an unambiguous legal framework for the
private sector.
Directors commended the U.A.E.’s open-border foreign labor policy, which has enabled the
private sector to recruit expatriate workers at internationally competitive wages and contributed
to economic growth. They welcomed the measures to increase employment of nationals in the
private sector, which should continue to rely on raising the skills of nationals through better
education and training programs, rather than on mandatory measures such as quotas. Labor
market reforms should aim at increasing flexibility in hiring and firing, and equalizing benefits for
nationals in the private and public sectors.
Directors welcomed the measures to improve the institutional statistics framework, including the
efforts of the Interministerial Statistical Committee and the authorities’ intention to participate in
the General Data Dissemination System. Nevertheless, the statistical database and procedures
need to be strengthened to enable effective monitoring of the economy. The compilation of
statistics on consolidated government activities needs to be improved, and structural
weaknesses with respect to data quality, coverage, periodicity, timeliness, and inter-sectoral
consistency need to be addressed. Better coordination between the Federal and Emirates
authorities, the commitment of adequate resources, and further staff training will be needed to
make progress in this area.
It is expected that the next Article IV consultation with the U.A.E. will be held on the standard
12-month cycle.

Public Information Notices (PINs) form part of the IMF's efforts to promote transparency of the IMF's
views and analysis of economic developments and policies. With the consent of the country
(or countries) concerned, PINs are issued after Executive Board discussions of Article IV consultations
with member countries, of its surveillance of developments at the regional level, of post-program
monitoring, and of ex post assessments of member countries with longer-term program engagements.
PINs are also issued after Executive Board discussions of general policy matters, unless otherwise
decided by the Executive Board in a particular case.
