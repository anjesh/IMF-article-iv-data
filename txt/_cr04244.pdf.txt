The last Article IV consultation was concluded on July 25, 2003, with Executive
Directors commending Sweden's strong economic record and the authorities’ welldesigned macroeconomic framework. Directors, however, expressed concern that the
continued rise in discretionary public spending had begun to undermine the strong
fiscal position and the prospects for a lasting reduction in Sweden’s high tax burden.
Noting the rising problem of sickness absence, Directors called for renewed efforts to
streamline the generous social insurance system in order to ensure fiscal
sustainability and reduce disincentives to work. Directors also underscored the need
for an impetus to measures aimed at reducing barriers to competition and improving
the functioning of product and labor markets.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
Background and Outlook: Supported by a strong fiscal stimulus, the economy underwent only a
mild downturn in 2002-03, with growth remaining well above the EU average. Economic activity is
expected to pick up steadily as the global recovery gains strength. Inflation pressures remain low
thanks to strong productivity gains, economic slack, and falling import prices. Persistent weakness in
the labor market contributed to wage moderation. With inflation forecast to remain below the
2 percent target, the Riksbank eased policy aggressively in early 2004, cutting its policy rate to a
historic low of 2 percent. Although still comfortable in the EU context, the fiscal position has
weakened as new spending initiatives jeopardize the expenditure ceilings and further delay the return
to the structural surplus target of 2 percent. Financial markets took in stride the rejection of the euro
in the September 2003 referendum.
Policy discussions centered on the following key issues:
•

The stance of short-term policies in light of the outlook for growth, employment and
inflation in 2004–05: While the Riksbank’s policy of keeping rates on hold was appropriate
for now, monetary policy would need to be tightened if upside risks began to materialize.

•

The prospects for attaining the authorities’ medium-term fiscal surplus target
and the growing risks to the framework of fiscal rules: The authorities and the
mission agreed that with the fiscal framework under strain, it was important to
maintain a firm commitment to the expenditure ceilings. The staff recommended
that a more ambitious fiscal adjustment in 2005-06 was needed to meet the
structural surplus target. The mission underscored its view that safeguarding the
surplus target was central to maintaining confidence in the fiscal framework.

•

The necessity of addressing the rising tensions in the public finances: These
tensions are evident in the pressures on expenditures, the finances of local authorities,
and the distortions stemming from the tax-transfer system: In the mission’s view, a
reform of the tax-benefit system to encourage effective labor supply was highly
desirable. Raising effective labor supply would help raise potential growth and reduce
tensions in public finances in the face of the coming demographic transition. Greater
policy coordination between central and local levels of government would help smooth
fluctuations in local revenue and alleviate local tax increases.

•

The need to strengthen the structural agenda: In the mission’s view, faster
progress was desirable, particularly in the areas of tax, labor, and product market
reform, in the light of challenges from demography, EU enlargement, and rapid
globalization. Encouraging effective labor supply is the most important long-term
challenge. The authorities agreed that there was scope for progress in reducing
sickness absence, promoting greater competition in product markets, and improving
the functioning of labor markets.

•

The risks to the financial system: Despite some concern about rising household debt, the
financial system remained sound.

I. ECONOMIC BACKGROUND
1.
Sweden’s strong economic performance in recent years is grounded in a
credible, rule-based policy framework. The framework, centered on a medium-term fiscal
strategy and a well-designed inflation targeting regime, has underpinned the authorities’
success in combining monetary and financial stability with solid economic growth. With
Swedish voters’ rejection of entry into the EMU, the inflation targeting framework will
continue to anchor monetary stability for the foreseeable future. The fiscal framework, while
well-designed, has however begun to experience growing strains under rising spending
pressures.
2.
The Swedish downturn was unusually mild, with growth remaining well above
the EU average in 2002–03 (Figure 1). Expansionary fiscal policy—the fiscal stimulus in
2002 was around 3 percent of GDP in contrast to the neutral stance in the euro area—
combined with low interest rates underpinned private consumption. However, the momentum
of activity slowed in the first half of 2003,

The fortunes of Ericsson, Sweden’s flagship technology company, have symbolized the ups
and downs of the world telecom sector in recent years. A leading producer of mobile telecom
infrastructure and Sweden’s largest exporter, the company suffered a massive decline in sales
and a loss of profitability in the technology crash of 2000–02. Having gone through a painful
restructuring process that trimmed its workforce by more than half over the past three years,
the company seems poised to benefit from a recovery in world markets.

Strong labor productivity growth coupled with economic slack dampened
inflation pressures, widening the room for monetary easing. After a spike in early 2003,
driven by rising energy prices, inflation fell back toward the 2 percent target (Figure 3).
Although the further fall in the annual inflation rate in early 2004 was anticipated on account
of base-year effects, strong productivity growth and falling import prices contributed to a
more rapid fall in inflation than expected, bringing it below the 2-percent target. The
restraining impact of wage moderation on labor costs also helped accelerate the disinflation
process. Inflation expectations, as measured by household and business surveys, have
remained low, with inflation expected to be below target one year ahead, gradually rising
toward 2 percent over a 2-year horizon.
5.
The competitive position remained strong, reflected in the large surplus on the
external current account. Financial markets took in stride the rejection of the euro in the
September 2003 referendum. The krona was broadly unchanged vis-à-vis the euro, but
appreciated by over 6 percent in effective terms in the year to March 2004, reflecting the
weaker U.S. dollar, and by 3 percent in real effective terms, measured by relative unit labor
costs (Figure 4). Nevertheless, with the krona remaining undervalued (see ¶13 below) and
with no further worsening of the terms of trade, the current account surplus rose from
5.4 percent of GDP in 2002 to a record-high of 6.4 percent of GDP in 2003 (Table 3). Longterm interest rates generally moved in line with those abroad and the differential with
Germany, after a brief spike following the euro referendum, fell to around 40 basis points in
April 2004. Led by a rebound in Ericsson’s share price, the Swedish stock market rose by
30 percent in 2003, outperforming many overseas exchanges (Figure 5). In the first five
months of 2004, stock prices have risen by around 6 percent.

II. THE POLICY SETTING AND THE SHORT-TERM OUTLOOK
6.
While the fiscal framework is well-designed, adherence to it has slipped in recent
years, primarily due to rising discretionary spending. The framework is built around a
structural surplus target of 2 percent of GDP at the general government level, complemented
by expenditure ceilings for the

central government and a
(in percent of GDP)
balanced budget rule for the
local authorities. The surplus
target was last met in 2001.
While a year ago, the official
expectation was that the target
would be reached in 2005, new
spending initiatives in the Spring
2004 Budget now preclude the
possibility of meeting the target
at least until 2007. Official
estimates suggest that, on
present policies, cumulative
deviations from the surplus
target would rise to 4 percent of
GDP by 2006.

7.
The budget for 2004 is broadly neutral, reflecting the expectation of a recovery.
The overall balance of the general government is planned to show a modest surplus. With
new spending initiatives in areas such as labor market programs and social assistance, and
increased grants to local authorities, only a marginal rise in the structural balance is
envisaged. The margins under the expenditure ceilings are once again too narrow to provide
any leeway in the event of unexpected shocks.
8.
With inflation falling faster than expected and forecast to remain below target,
the Riksbank eased policy aggressively in early 2004. While taking note of the uncertainty
in assessing the cyclical and trend components of the recent strong productivity growth, the
Riksbank has tended toward a cautiously optimistic view. Policy was eased gradually during
2003. Reacting to continued declines in actual and forecast inflation, the Riksbank cut its
policy rate by 25 basis points in February 2004 and by another 50 basis points in early April
to 2 percent, its lowest level for more than 50 years. The Swedish policy rate is now at the
same level as in the euro area. Signaling the end of an easing cycle, the Riksbank then shifted
to a neutral policy bias and left the rate unchanged in May.
9.
As the global recovery gathers pace, economic activity in Sweden is expected to
pick up steadily in 2004–05. Adjusted for calendar effects, output is expected to rise by
around 2 percent, rather than the unadjusted forecast of 2½ percent, implying a lower
utilization of resources. Indeed, the recovery over the coming year is unlikely to be
accompanied by substantial gains in employment. The supportive monetary and fiscal policy

-8-

stance and rising household confidence should stimulate private consumption, and improved
demand prospects and profit position of manufacturing should assist a revival in business
investment. Barring a sustained spike in oil prices, strong productivity gains and moderate
wage increases would be expected to keep inflation below the target of 2 percent. The risks
to this scenario are evenly balanced. The external demand stimulus could be larger than
expected, especially if the krona continued to remain undervalued. However, protracted
weakness in the labor market could hold back consumer spending and persistent excess
capacity in manufacturing could again postpone the projected pick up in business investment.
III. THE POLICY DISCUSSIONS
10.
The discussions took place on the backdrop of Sweden’s recent solid record of
growth and stability, but rising fiscal strains and the emerging challenges presented by
the demographic transition and EU enlargement. With Sweden’s decision to remain
outside the euro area, the inflation targeting framework will remain central to ensuring
monetary stability. The Fund has viewed this framework and the Riksbank’s operation of it
as consistent with international best practice. While the fiscal framework has also generally
been regarded as well-designed, the recent deviation from the fiscal target has raised
concerns. The staff and the Executive Board have consistently urged a strict adherence to the
framework to ensure fiscal sustainability and create room to reduce the high tax burden. The
authorities’ phased program of tax cuts is on hold for now, in view of the fiscal position. The
Fund has also continued to argue the case for further streamlining the welfare state.2 The
authorities, while not disagreeing in principle on the desirability of improving the incentive
structure to encourage greater work effort and promoting competition, have preferred a more
modest pace of reform. With the recent EU enlargement and the ongoing process of global
economic integration, the issue of how to spark greater dynamism and growth in the Swedish
economy has become more urgent.
11.

In this light, the discussions centered on the following key themes:

•

The stance of short-term policies in light of the outlook for growth, employment
and inflation in 2004–05;

•

The prospects for attaining the authorities’ medium-term fiscal surplus target and
the growing risks to the framework of fiscal rules;

2

The staff’s case for reform of the Swedish model has been elaborated in a recent Fund
publication and was the subject of a post-mission conference held in Stockholm, with
participation by Swedish academics, parliamentarians, the mission chief Subhash Thakur and
EUR Director Michael Deppler. See Subhash Thakur, Michael Keen, Balazs Horvath, and
Valerie Cerra, 2003, Sweden’s Welfare State—Can the Bumblebee Keep Flying?,
(Washington, International Monetary Fund).

A. Monetary Policy and the Financial Sector

12.
The Riksbank forecasts inflation to remain below target over the next two years,
but on a gradually upward path. The central scenario in the June 2004 Inflation Report,
published soon after the conclusion of the discussions, projects the 12-month inflation at just
over 1 percent by mid-2005, steadily rising to around 2¼ percent by mid-2006. The Riksbank
viewed the risks on the domestic side as broadly balanced, with the expected strength of
productivity growth helping to restrain costs as resource utilization rose. The upside risk to
the forecast was dominated by the possibility that the global as well as the Swedish upturn
could prove to be stronger than expected and that geopolitical factors could lead to sustained
high oil prices. In the latter event, there was also a risk of second-round effects on wages.
Although the results of the recently concluded 3-year wage agreements have been moderate,
local authority wage outcomes for 2005 could be higher than expected. In sum, upside risks
would begin to predominate beyond the one-year horizon.
13.
Looking ahead, there was agreement that monetary policy would need to be
tightened if upside risks began to materialize as the recovery proceeded. The Riksbank’s
decision to keep the policy rate on hold for now was viewed as appropriate by the mission. It
noted, however, that the eventual tightening would have to occur earlier rather than later if
the stance of fiscal policy was not adequately tight. The Riksbank officials concurred with
the mission’s view that the krona remained undervalued, although their estimate of the extent
of undervaluation was lower than that of the staff.4 In any event, markets expected the krona
to appreciate further in view of the prospects for solid growth and productivity gains in the
Swedish economy and sustained large current account surpluses. Any significant
appreciation would tend to dampen inflation, although recent evidence for Europe and
research by the Riksbank suggested that the pass-through could be protracted.
3

Two Selected Issues papers prepared by the mission, on local government finances and
sickness absence, served as background to the discussions.
4

Most model-based econometric estimates suggest that the krona has been weaker than its
equilibrium value. The staff’s latest estimate, based on the macroeconomic balance approach
as well as a panel estimation of purchasing power parity adjusted for fundamental factors
such as terms of trade, relative productivity and income flows on net foreign assets, suggests
an undervaluation of around 10 percent.

- 10 -

14.
The Riksbank officials agreed that communication of their policy framework
could be improved by underscoring the role of the CPI as the only target variable. With
expectations firmly anchored to the CPI as the target variable, the Riksbank has focused its
forecast on the CPI over a one- to two-year horizon, but highlighted various measures of
underlying inflation to rightly underscore that policy would not try to counter the effects of
transitory shocks that cause projected inflation to deviate from its target level. Officials did
not dispute that occasional confusion as to the precise target variable could be avoided by
making explicit the role of judgment in inflation assessments and by extending the forecast
horizon beyond two years. Indeed, Riksbank officials, in their recent public expositions of
policy conduct, have considered the latter option. Looking ahead, the planned change in
Statistics Sweden’s method of calculation of the CPI from January 2005 is expected to lead
to the recorded inflation rate being 0.2 percentage point per year lower as compared to the
one based on the current method. This measurement change would have an one-off effect of
appearing to raise the inflation target and this is being explained by the Riksbank in its
communication to the public.
15.
Indicators of financial system health remain favorable. Bank profitability has
risen, partly reflecting cost reductions, and banks have strengthened their balance sheets
further in the context of greater competition. Household debt, as in many other countries, has
continued to rise, with the ratio of debt to disposable income up from 90 percent in the
mid-1990s to about 120 percent. However, interest payments are only 5 percent of disposable
income, compared with 11 percent in the early 1990s, and household assets exceed their
liabilities. Simulations by the Riksbank suggest that even a relatively steep rise in interest
rates would not significantly impair households’ ability to service debt.5 The rise in house
prices, comparable to that in other advanced economies, is largely explained by structural
supply shortages. Thus, the household sector as a whole does not constitute a significant risk
to the banks. Corporate borrowing from banks has been declining for sometime, reflecting
falling private investment, and corporate ability to service debt has improved. The tier 1
capital of the major banks has continued to increase and, at just over 7 percent, is regarded as
satisfactory by the authorities. All in all, risks in the financial system appear well contained
and the supervisory authorities are alert to signs of any emerging imbalances that might pose
new risks.
B. Fiscal Policy and the Fiscal Framework
16.
The structural fiscal surplus target and the expenditure ceilings continue to be
the key pillars of the authorities’ fiscal strategy, despite recent strains. While conceding
that on present projections, the structural surplus of the general government was not likely to
reach the target of 2 percent before 2007 at the earliest, officials did not see this as damaging
to the credibility of policy. Officials were at pains to underscore that Sweden’s fiscal target
was considerably more ambitious than set by the EU countries within the framework of the
5

The Riksbank, Financial Stability Report, 2004:1.

- 11 -

Stability and Growth Pact (SGP). Viewed in this light, Sweden’s recent fiscal performance,
while falling short of the goals of its own framework, was not unsatisfactory. The mission
argued that the average fiscal performance in the EU was not necessarily an appropriate
benchmark and that Sweden’s own well-considered fiscal framework—which would provide
a cushion for the future demographic impact on the public welfare systems while providing
ample room for maneuver in the event of downturns—should remain the touchstone for
assessing fiscal conduct. It was also important to note that the Swedish model of a generous
welfare state based on public provision of services implied the need for healthier public
finances than in countries with a greater role for private provision.
17.
The margins under the central government expenditure ceilings have been
exhausted as they have been used largely for discretionary spending. In the past two
years, the authorities have had to resort to a variety of ad hoc measures—such as shifting
expenditures between years and increasing use of tax expenditures— in order to keep within
the ceilings. Officials conceded that

programs. The budgetary outlook for

The main risks to the expenditure projections in the Spring budget stemmed from the
possibility of a smaller decline in sickness absence than the projected fall of 18 percent and a
delayed pick-up in employment. Officials nevertheless underlined the government’s firm
commitment to the expenditure ceilings as the key instrument for restraining the growth of
spending and as central to maintaining credibility. They were candid in acknowledging that
further resort to one-off measures to remain under the ceilings could not be ruled out. The
ceilings for 2007, to be set in the next budget, are likely to include margins for cyclical
spending, as recommended by the staff.
18.
The prospects for a significant reduction in the tax burden have dimmed
further. The authorities have reiterated that within the constraints set by the spending
priorities, tax cuts could be implemented if they could be afforded. Reflecting this position,
the fourth and final step of the program of phased reduction in income taxes has been on hold
since 2002. Officials stated that the government intended to implement the remaining step at
a time when the fiscal position allowed. The authorities accepted, in principle, the view of the
recent report of the Swedish Tax Base Commission that reducing the high rate of marginal
tax on labor was desirable to raise labor supply and potential growth. However, the
government placed priority on improving the incentive structure of the existing tax-benefit
system rather than on reducing taxes. High marginal effective tax rates on domestic savings
could be eased and the fairness of the tax system improved by increasing the threshold of the
wealth tax and reducing exemptions. In the mission’s view, raising corporate taxation to

make up for revenue losses from lowering or abolishing the wealth tax would, however,
adversely affect investment and be contrary to international trends.6
19.
Finances of the local authorities, responsible for the provision of the bulk of
public services, continue to be strained (Box 1). Officials noted that the pressures on local
spending reflected demographic changes and the central government’s policy priorities.
Constrained by the balanced budget rule, many municipalities and county councils have tried
to cut costs. Nevertheless, at times facing underfunded mandates, municipalities have raised
local income taxes in recent years. The rising tax rates of local authorities have partially
offset the tax cuts implemented at the central government level. The authorities are
considering various ways of improving coordination between the central and local levels of
government such as by requiring local authorities to specify more clearly their medium-term
plans. Options that would reduce uncertainty regarding the amounts of central grants
available to local authorities are also being explored.
20.
Sweden is in a relatively favorable position to meet its long-term demographic
challenges. Gross public debt is at a moderate level and the debt position appears sustainable
(Table 5). The reforms implemented in1999 have placed the public pension system on a
sound financial footing in response to the expected sharp rise in the dependency ratio. These
reforms introduced an automatic balancing mechanism in the system in order to ensure longterm actuarial balance. However, Sweden’s spending on health and long-term care—at
around 9 percent of GDP, already among the highest in the EU—is projected to rise to over
12 percent of GDP in 2050, well above the EU average. The planned build-up of assets over
the coming years which can later be drawn down as other age-related spending rises, rests
critically on meeting the target for general government surplus.7 Continued slippages in
adhering to the target could put long-term fiscal sustainability at risk.

6

Estimates of assets held abroad to evade taxation range widely between 2 to10 percent of
GDP. Cutting or abolishing the wealth tax would reduce incentives for outflows, but the
quantitative impact on net inflows is uncertain.
7

Under a recent Eurostat ruling, which is currently under discussion with the Swedish
authorities, the surpluses of the pension system, amounting to 1 percent of GDP, would be
excluded from the general government accounts. Implementation of the ruling would have
important implications for the general government surplus target.

Sweden’s large and highly decentralized government sector is facing increasing financial
strains. These strains are manifest in the rising spending pressures on local governments. Facing a
balanced budget requirement since 2000, local

authorities have resorted to raising local income
tax rates (text figure). Local income tax revenue
is large—in the order of 16 percent of GDP—and
recent tax increases have eliminated about one
quarter of the income tax relief granted by the
central government. In a selected issues paper
accompanying this report, the staff has tried to
assess Sweden’s local public finances from an
international perspective, and empirically

excludes outside values

Sweden has a long tradition of extensive local self-government. Like other Nordic countries,
local expenditures exceed 40 percent of general government spending with two thirds of it financed
from local income tax. Sweden stands out with greater local responsibilities in demographically
sensitive areas and an exceptionally high degree of local tax policy autonomy. In addition to
education and childcare, local spending is strongly tilted towards health and long-term care, which is
sensitive to population aging. Tax policy autonomy is embedded in the constitution and allows local
governments to autonomously set local tax rates.
Rising per capita outlays for health and long-tem care services have been a driving factor
behind local tax rate increases. Econometric analysis of municipal tax rate increases shows that
both higher expenses on long-term care as well as population aging have contributed to a rise in tax
rates. Wider local tax bases and higher vertical grants could help alleviate this trend. Looking
forward, demographic shifts will likely put additional pressures on local governments—despite
lower childcare and education needs in the medium-term—making further tax rate increases
probable.
Better control over aggregate tax policy would require improved vertical policy coordination,
more predictable local financing sources, and the use of incentives to stick to agreed targets.
Sweden’s reliance on a balanced budget rule for local authorities may have distracted efforts to
develop a more integrated approach of intergovernmental fiscal planning. Budgets of local and
central government are drafted in parallel with little exchange on common tax policy objectives.
Effective medium-term planning at the local level is hindered by uncertainties about volatile tax
revenue and by frequent modifications of central grants. Experience in Denmark and Austria shows
that many of these shortcomings can be addressed through a formalized budget preparation process,
in which local and central government reach agreement over medium-term expenditure targets, tax
rates, and vertical grants. An important element would be high public visibility and transparency of
agreed targets to heighten public accountability.

- 14 -

C. Structural Policies and Other Issues
21.
While conceding that a faster pace of reforms might be desirable, the authorities
viewed their record of structural reform as among the best in the EU. It was noted that
Sweden ranked high in various structural indicators of progress under the Lisbon strategy
annually prepared by the European Commission—notably in key areas such as public
finances, employment, labor force participation among older workers, investment in research
and development, and progress towards the Kyoto targets for greenhouse gas emissions. The
mission also found commendable Sweden’s success in building social cohesion and
promoting knowledge-intensive activities. The authorities agreed that, notwithstanding these
achievements, scope for progress existed in areas such as reducing sickness absence,
promoting greater competition in product markets and improving the functioning of labor
markets.
22.
The key structural challenge over the long-term is how to encourage greater
effective labor supply. The working age population is projected to grow very slowly over
the coming five decades, with the entire rise of 5 percent (0.1 percent per year) due to
immigration. The effective supply of labor is expected to fall as a result of the aging of the
native-born population, low labor participation rates among immigrants, and falling average
working hours. Given the potentially growing importance of the foreign-born population to
labor force growth, officials stressed the importance of efforts to enhance the economic
integration of immigrants. It was noted in this context that Sweden is one of the few EU
countries not to have imposed any special transition rules governing the right of access to its
labor market for citizens from the ten new member states. This decision was consistent with
Sweden’s traditional liberal approach to immigration. In the mission’s view, easing the high
wage compression would facilitate the absorption of low-skilled immigrants into the labor
force. Noting the declining trend of youth participation, the mission also pointed to the need
to review the incentive structure in the education system to encourage entry into the
workforce at a younger average age.
23.
The high incidence of sickness absence continues to be a major hindrance to
raising effective labor supply (Box 2). Despite some leveling off in sickness absence last
year, the rate of sickness absence remained high. Officials did not dispute the mission’s view
that the high sickness absence in Sweden is explained not only by the high labor force
participation of older persons but also by the generosity of the benefit regime. They noted
that employers would be sharing more of the cost of sick leave, having to finance 15 percent
of the cost of sickness absence after the first two weeks of sickness. Officials explained that
the marginal cut in the replacement rate for sickness introduced last year was strictly a
reflection of budgetary stringency and was not intended to influence incentives. The
reduction will be reversed from 2005 and officials saw no prospect of lowering sickness
benefits. However, the authorities intended to tighten the administration of the sickness
insurance system with a view to minimizing abuse and misuse. Other measures to reduce
sickness absence such as more flexible work arrangements and improved workplace

Box 2. The Problem of Sickness Absence
The incidence of sickness absence in Sweden is among the highest in Europe and has risen
sharply in recent years. The rate of
sickness absence was 5.2 percent in
Sweden on average over the period
1995–2003. Possibly reflecting high
participation of women, the absence rate
was 7 percent for female workers in the
same period. Including people on
disability pension, almost 15 percent of
the working age population was away
from work in 2003.

The costs of sickness absence and disability retirement are substantial, not only in terms of
the public finances, but also in terms of labor supply and potential growth. Sickness-related
public transfers, including disability pensions, amounted to 4.6 percent of GDP in 2003. In
1990-99, sickness benefits averaged 1.4 percent of GDP, second only to the Netherlands in the
OECD. Employers currently pay sick benefit at 80 percent of wages for the first 20 days of
illness. Costs in terms of forgone output, even though highly uncertain, are likely to be
substantial. With the expected negative impact of demographics and declining work effort,
containing work absence is also crucial as part of a strategy aimed at stimulating labor supply.
High sickness absence is a recurring problem in Sweden and has motivated various
attempts to modify the generous public insurance system (Figure 7). Since 1997 sickness
absence has risen sharply to a recent peak, prompting the government to set the goal of halving
sickness absence between 2002 and 2008. Recently, while cases of sick leave declined, the
duration of sickness absence has increased, reflected in a surge in the number of people receiving
sickness compensation. Most recent initiatives are aimed at increasing responsibilities of all
parties involved with a strong emphasis on ensuring fast rehabilitation. However, at the same
time, the employer’s obligation period will be cut to first two weeks of sickness absence and the
compensation rate will be slightly raised, making the overall incentive impact of the new reform
measures ambiguous.
The high sickness absence in Sweden cannot be entirely explained by high participation
rates. A staff study (see Selected Issues Paper) finds that participation rates and demographic
factors cannot fully account for the observed absence rates within a panel of European countries.
Generosity of the sickness insurance system, working time arrangements (contractual hours and
flexible hours of work), and cyclical effects play a decisive role, too. Even when controlling for
these factors, absence rate in Sweden—supporting earlier empirical evidence—remains distinct
as manifested by a significant impact of Sweden-specific participation rate, sickness benefits, and
unemployment gap. The study also underscores the importance of interactions of the sickness
insurance system with labor market institutions, in particular unemployment insurance and
employment protection. Reducing contractual hours may not be inconsistent with policies to
reduce absence, though the impact of working time reduction may depend also on the availability
of flexible working arrangements.

- 16 -

environment were also expected to help ease the problem. The mission argued that reducing
the replacement rate would need to be a key element of any package of measures designed to
achieve the authorities’ goal of reducing sickness absence to half its 2002 level by 2008.
24.
The authorities agreed that the tax-benefit system had important disincentive
effects on labor supply. Officials felt, however, that these effects had been mitigated by the
recent income tax cuts, and should be seen in the larger context of a system which also
provided many positive incentives. For instance, public spending on child care and care of
the elderly helped promote high female participation. Officials agreed that the incentives
were also greatly influenced by the interaction of various social welfare programs and labor
market institutions and a systematic evaluation of these complex interactions was necessary
to fashion an effective policy response.
25.
There was agreement on the need to strengthen competition in product markets.
Although competition had increased substantially in the past decade, barriers to competition
are still significant, especially in the construction, pharmaceuticals and retail trade sectors,
and the Swedish price level remained significantly above the EU average. The authorities
have been considering ways to encourage greater competition between public and private
sectors in the provision of public services. Officials conceded that administrative controls on
rent-setting and the large public ownership of housing, particularly in the rental sector, may
be inhibiting the development of an efficient rental market. The lack of a properly
functioning housing market has also depressed housing investment and tended to hamper
labor mobility. Nevertheless, officials saw little prospect of significant deregulation of rental
housing because such a step was seen as contrary to the overriding objective of ensuring
affordable housing to everyone.
26.
The Swedish government is playing a positive role in the efforts to revitalize the
Doha Development Agenda. The authorities strongly support elimination of subsidies to
farm exports and substantial reduction of domestic support to agriculture in the advanced
countries. They continue to advocate liberal access to exports from low-income developing
countries. At 0.7 percent of GNP, Sweden’s official development assistance remains one of
the highest in the world.
IV. STAFF APPRAISAL
27.
Sweden’s economic performance over the past decade has been impressive,
especially in the comparative context of the European Union. Along with satisfactory
growth and macroeconomic stability, the latter grounded in the framework of fiscal rules and
an inflation targeting framework that has garnered high credibility, Sweden has made
important strides in preparing for the coming demographic transition. Notably, reforms have
been implemented to place the public pension system on a sound financial footing. With a
leading role in knowledge-intensive activities, the economy is well positioned to reap the
fruits of technological advances.

- 17 -

28.
The economy weathered the global downturn relatively well. A notable feature of
recent growth has been a strong rise in productivity, helping to bring inflation well under the
target of 2 percent. The mirror image of the rise in productivity has, however, been a
continuing fall in employment and sharply rising unemployment, both open and latent.
Looking beyond the cyclical recovery expected in the near term, Sweden should be well
positioned to build on its recent successes by reviving the agenda for structural reform which
has lost momentum in the last couple of years.
29.
The waning pace of structural reforms is a cause for concern. The relatively
benign economic outlook and the parliamentary election calendar would suggest that this is
an opportune moment for addressing the unfinished task of further streamlining the Swedish
welfare state. Indeed, in the aftermath of the referendum on the euro late last year, the
government launched a public discussion on how to promote growth, but so far without a
concrete program of action. As the European Union expands and global economic integration
gathers pace, it is critical for Sweden not to miss this window of opportunity to enhance its
long-term prospects for growth and welfare.
30.
With inflation projected to be below target over the next two years, a policy of
keeping rates on hold for the near term would be appropriate. As the restraining impact
of domestic influences recedes over time and upside risks from the projected upturn at home
and abroad begin to predominate, inflation is expected to rise gradually. The policy rate
would accordingly need to be raised in due course. To the extent that the fiscal stance is
insufficiently restrictive as the recovery gathers speed, monetary policy would need to be
tightened earlier rather than later.
31.
The Riksbank’s conduct of monetary policy and its success in achieving the
inflation target have earned it high credibility, although there may still be room for
clearer communication. The outcome of the recent round of wage negotiations testifies to
the Riksbank’s ability to guide expectations. However, it appears that the Riksbank has not
always succeeded in communicating clearly its message to the markets, resulting on occasion
in some confusion about the target variable and horizon. There may be room for refining the
communication strategy by being more explicit about the role of judgment in assessments
and extending the forecast horizon beyond two years.
32.
Safeguarding the fiscal surplus target of two percent of GDP over the business
cycle is central to maintain confidence in Sweden’s medium-term fiscal framework.
Although the framework has a good track record and Sweden’s position remains favorable in
a comparative EU context, efforts to attain the target for the general government have
slackened in the recent past. Over time, this gradual weakening could raise concerns about
fiscal discipline and begin to undermine the fiscal framework that has served to anchor
macroeconomic stability. A more ambitious fiscal adjustment in 2005–06 through forceful
measures to rein in public spending would serve to demonstrate the authorities’ commitment
to achieve the target.

- 18 -

33.
The authorities should adhere strictly to the expenditure ceilings and ensure that
margins are restricted to cyclical spending. The ceilings have no margins left for error this
year and there are signs that spending on sickness and disability benefits will not slow down
as much as expected. A coherent medium-term plan is needed to contain public spending
without resorting to ad hoc steps such as shifting expenditure between years and additional
tax expenditures.
34.
The scope for tax cuts has narrowed further even as they are needed to provide
impetus to work effort and saving. The tax burden of the general government, already one
of the highest in the world, is likely to rise further as local governments try to balance their
budgets. As international competition over tax bases intensifies, a review of the complex
capital tax system, encompassing taxation of wealth, inheritance, and gifts, is warranted.
35.
The rising tax burden is, in part, a reflection of insufficient policy coordination
between central and local governments. The intention to encourage local authorities to
specify more clearly their medium-term spending plans could go some way towards
improving fiscal coordination. The use of balancing grants from the central government
would help smooth fluctuations in local revenue and prevent procyclical increases in tax
rates.
36.
The financial system remains sound. Bank profitability has improved and capital
adequacy and loss provision remain at satisfactory levels. Although household debt has kept
rising, low interest expenses and higher home values serve to considerably mitigate its
burden. All in all, credit risks appear well contained, although those associated with a
significant decline in property values or a rise in interest rates bear careful monitoring.
37.
A decisive reform of the tax-benefit regime is necessary to improve incentives,
raise potential growth, and ease fiscal pressures. Cutbacks in entitlements, coupled with a
reduction in the high tax burden on labor, would help encourage greater effective labor
supply in the face of population ageing and the sharp fall in hours worked. Sizeable steps in
this direction are required to realize the authorities’ ambitious labor market and social policy
objectives such as the target of 80-percent employment rate and the goals of halving the
number of people on social assistance and sickness leave. High wage compression and
generous social benefits continue to impede an efficient use of labor resources. Overall,
underlying trends in labor supply signal a need for more fundamental policy reforms rather
than short-term palliatives.
38.
Efficient use of human resources is imperative for long-term sustainability of the
Swedish model. As the main source of labor supply over the coming years is expected to be
the foreign-born population, better integration of immigrants into the labor force is crucial.
At the same time, the incentive structure in the education system could be re-assessed to help
reverse the declining trend of youth participation. The role of incentives in sickness absence
warrants a better recognition. In this context, the decision to reverse the small reduction in
the replacement rate of sickness benefits introduced last year is clearly unhelpful.

- 19 -

39.
Strengthening competition in product markets is a necessary component of the
agenda for growth. Reducing rigidities that continue to impair the functioning of product
markets would raise consumer welfare and could have positive spillover effects on the labor
market. With controls on rent-setting inhibiting the development of an efficient rental market,
there is room to move towards a more market-oriented approach that would preserve social
policy objectives. Internationally, Sweden’s advocacy of liberal trade policies serves to
complement well its commendable record of generous development assistance.
40.
The authorities deserve to be commended for their high level of official development
assistance.
41.
Sweden’s provision of economic statistics is adequate for the purpose of Fund
surveillance.
42.

Sweden is expected to remain on the standard 12-month consultation cycle.

denominated debt; and ε = nominal exchange rate depreciation (measured by increase in local currency value of U.S. dollar).
3/ The real interest rate contribution is derived from the denominator in footnote 2/ as r - π (1+g) and the real growth contribution as -g.
4/ The exchange rate contribution is derived from the numerator in footnote 2/ as αε(1+r).
5/ For projections, this line includes exchange rate changes.
6/ Defined as public sector deficit, plus amortization of medium and long-term public sector debt, plus short-term debt at end of previous period.
7/ Derived as nominal interest expenditure divided by previous period debt stock.
8/ The key variables include real GDP growth; real interest rate; and primary balance in percent of GDP.
9/ The implied change in other key variables under this scenario is discussed in the text.
10/ Real depreciation is defined as nominal depreciation (measured by percentage fall in dollar value of local currency) minus domestic inflation (based on GDP deflator).
11/ Assumes that key variables (real GDP growth, real interest rate, and primary balance) remain at the level in percent of GDP/growth rate of the last projection year.

Statement by the IMF Staff Representative
August 4, 2004
The following information on economic and financial developments, which has become
available since the release of the staff report, does not change the thrust of the staff
appraisal.
1.
Economic activity continues to pick up speed, led by the strength of exports.
Although rising industrial orders augur well for industrial production and exports, the
recovery has yet to spur growth in employment. Indeed, the unemployment rate—a
lagging indicator—rose from 5.3 percent in May 2004 to 5.8 percent in June.
2.
Inflation slowed further in June. The consumer price index rose by 0.5 percent
in the year to June, as compared with a 12-month rate of 0.7 percent in May. The measure
of underlying inflation was 1 percent, somewhat below market expectations. The
Riksbank left its policy rate unchanged at 2 percent on June 23.
3.
The krona depreciated slightly against the euro in July. It reached a threemonth low of Skr 9.2 per euro at end-July, but remained strong against the U.S. dollar. In
terms of its trade-weighted index, the krona depreciated by 1 percent during June–July.

the Article IV consultation with Sweden.1
Background
The downturn experienced by the Swedish economy in 2002-03 was relatively mild, with growth
remaining well above the EU average. Expansionary fiscal policy in 2002 underpinned private
consumption. Private investment, however, remained weak and activity decelerated when the
impact of public sector stimulus waned in the first half of 2003. With external demand picking up
in the second half, activity resumed its strength. The steady upturn, driven by exports and
household demand sustained by low interest rates, has continued in early 2004.
Growth has been sustained by a strong rise in productivity, which, while partly cyclical, suggests
significant efficiency gains from the diffusion of new technologies. Coupled with economic slack,
productivity growth dampened inflation pressures, widening the room for monetary easing.
Inflation fell rapidly back toward the 2 percent target and continued to decline in early 2004 on
account of base-year effects, falling import prices and strong productivity growth. Inflation
expectations have remained low, contributing to wage moderation.
The recovery, however, has yet to turn around the decline in employment and average hours
worked. Unemployment rose sharply in the year to early 2004, reflecting continued labor
1

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies.
On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the
Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the
Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the
country's authorities.

-2shedding by the business sector and financially constrained local governments. The average
duration of unemployment increased as did youth unemployment. In recent years, the high rate
of sickness absence has been primarily responsible for the fall in average hours worked.
Although sickness absence leveled off in 2003, the adverse impact of overall ill health on labor
supply continued to rise as many on long-term sick leave shift to disability pension.
The competitive position remained strong, reflected in the large surplus on the external current
account. The krona was broadly unchanged vis-à-vis the euro, but appreciated by over
6 percent in effective terms in the year to March 2004, reflecting the weaker U.S. dollar, and by
3 percent in real effective terms, measured by relative unit labor costs. Nevertheless, with the
krona remaining undervalued and with no further worsening of the terms of trade, the current
account surplus rose from 5.4 percent of GDP in 2002 to a record-high of 6.4 percent of GDP in
2003. Financial markets took in stride the rejection of the euro in the September 2003
referendum.
With inflation falling faster than expected and forecast to remain below target, the Riksbank
eased policy aggressively in early 2004.The policy rate was cut by 25 basis points in February
2004 and by another 50 basis points in early April to 2 percent, its lowest level for more than
50 years. The Swedish policy rate is now at the same level as in the euro area. Signaling the
end of an easing cycle, the Riksbank left the rate unchanged in May and June.
The budget for 2004 is broadly neutral and only a marginal rise in the structural surplus of the
general government is expected. The fiscal framework is built around a structural surplus target
of 2 percent of GDP, complemented by expenditure ceilings for the central government and a
balanced budget rule for the local authorities. However, with new spending initiatives in the
Spring 2004 Budget, the surplus target is not expected to be met at least until 2007.
The margins under the expenditure ceilings are once again too narrow to provide any leeway in
the event of unexpected shocks.
Economic activity is expected to pick up steadily in 2004-05 as the global recovery gathers
pace. Adjusted for calendar effects, output is expected to rise by around 2 percent in 2004,
rather than the unadjusted forecast of 2½ percent. The supportive monetary and fiscal policy
stance and rising household confidence should stimulate private consumption, and improved
demand prospects and profit position of manufacturing should assist a revival in business
investment. Barring a sustained spike in oil prices, strong productivity gains and moderate wage
increases would be expected to keep inflation below the target of 2 percent. The external
demand stimulus could be larger than expected, especially if the krona continued to remain
undervalued. However, the recovery over the coming year is unlikely to be accompanied by
substantial gains in employment, which could hold back consumer spending, and persistent
excess capacity in manufacturing could again postpone the projected pick up in business
investment.

Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors praised Sweden’s strong economic performance in recent years, grounded
in well-designed fiscal and monetary policy frameworks, and strong productivity gains that have
succeeded in making the downturn in 2002–03 more moderate than the average in the
European Union. Directors noted that such strong performance had been thus far consistent
with the generous welfare state. They saw a need, however, to revitalize the agenda of
structural reform in order to address the challenges of demographic transition and global
economic integration.
Directors considered that economic activity should gather strength in the near-term, as the
global recovery picks up pace and monetary and fiscal policies remain supportive. Directors
noted, however, that in spite of the recovery, employment and average hours worked are still
declining, with uncertain prospects for a reversal in this trend.
Directors concurred that, with inflation projected to be below target over the next two years, a
policy of keeping interest rates on hold for the near term would be appropriate. They considered
that, as the recovery gathers speed, monetary policy will need to be tightened, particularly if the
fiscal stance is not adequately restrictive. Directors commended the Riksbank’s success in
achieving the inflation target that has earned it high credibility. Nevertheless, they saw some
room for refining its communications strategy, by making explicit the role of judgment in inflation
assessments and extending the forecast horizon beyond two years.
Directors noted that Sweden’s fiscal framework has a good track record and its fiscal position
remains favorable in a comparative EU context. Nevertheless, noting that efforts to attain the
fiscal surplus target have slackened in the recent past, Directors emphasized that safeguarding
the target is central to maintain confidence in Sweden’s medium-term fiscal framework. Most
Directors encouraged the authorities to consider a more ambitious fiscal adjustment in 2005–06
to demonstrate their continued commitment to the surplus target.
Directors observed that there are no margins left for error in the expenditure ceilings and that
pressures on public spending are unlikely to ease significantly as spending on sickness and
disability benefits may not decrease as much as expected. In Directors’ view, strict adherence
to expenditure ceilings remains a key instrument for restraining the growth of spending,
maintaining credibility of the fiscal framework, and allowing for a reduction in the high tax
burden to ease constraints on growth. Some Directors cautioned against continued use of ad
hoc measures to meet fiscal targets, as they could undermine transparency and credibility of the
fiscal framework.
Directors noted that the rising tensions in public finances are also evident at the level of local
governments. Local authorities have raised income tax rates in order to meet the balanced
budget requirement in a context of increasing demands for public services related to health care
and elderly care. Noting that the rising tax burden also reflects insufficient policy coordination
between central and local governments, Directors encouraged the authorities to consider

-4improving fiscal coordination and the use of balancing grants from the central government.
Directors also underlined the importance of efforts to review the complex capital tax system in
view of the intensifying international competition over tax bases.
Directors underscored the need to reform the tax-benefit regime to improve work incentives and
achieve the increase in labor supply needed to meet the authorities’ ambitious employment and
social policy objectives. In this context, Directors highlighted the importance of more effective
steps to reduce sickness absence, better integration of immigrants into the labor force, and
efforts to reverse the declining trend in youth participation. A number of Directors urged the
authorities to make a concerted effort to mobilize public support to address the incentive
aspects of sickness absence as a key requirement to make any significant progress in this area.
Directors viewed a strengthening of competition in product markets as a necessary component
of the agenda for faster growth. Directors welcomed the authorities’ efforts to promote greater
competition between public and private sectors in the provision of public services.
They observed, however, that barriers to competition still remain significant in some sectors.
Against this background, Directors recommended a faster pace of structural reforms,
particularly in light of the challenges stemming from an ageing population, EU enlargement, and
globalization.
Directors concurred that Sweden’s financial system remains sound. They noted that bank
profitability has improved and capital adequacy and loan loss provisions remain at satisfactory
levels. Although household debt has continued to rise, low interest expenses and higher home
values mitigate its burden. Considering overall credit risks well-contained, Directors encouraged
continued careful monitoring of risks associated with potential fluctuations in property values or
a rise in interest rates.
Directors praised the authorities’ positive role in revitalizing the Doha Development Agenda and
Sweden’s high level of official development assistance, which, at 0.7 percent of GNP, remains
one of the highest in the world.

Statement by Jon A. Solheim, Executive Director for Sweden
and David Farelius, Senior Advisor to Executive Director
August 4, 2004
1. Our authorities wish to express their appreciation to the staff for the constructive
discussions in Stockholm and for an interesting and useful report on the Article IV
consultation. They also found the selected issues paper interesting and relevant. Let us also
state that our authorities noted a change of tone between the main staff report and the
concluding statement that was published at the end of the mission to Sweden. We welcome
the more nuanced views of the staff report. Our authorities share many of the conclusions and
views expressed in the report. On some important issues, in particular related to fiscal and
structural policies, however, the views of our authorities are different from those expressed in
the staff report.
2. After a three-year period of growth lower than potential, the activity of the Swedish
economy is expected to pick up in 2004 and 2005, following the upswing in the international
economy. Looking back it is clear that the Swedish economy managed to withstand the
international recession better than most other European countries, despite the fact that it was
hit severely by the problems in the telecommunications sector. The average rate of growth
during the years 2001-2003 was 1.5 per cent for Sweden, compared to 1.1 per cent for EU-15
and 1 per cent for the euro area. Despite clear signs of an economic recovery the inflationary
pressure is still low. In response to the low inflation pressure the Riksbank has decided to
reduce interest rates by another 0.75 percentage points since the consultation in 2003.
3. Our authorities agree with the staff that the fiscal and monetary policy frameworks have
served Sweden well and that it is important to preserve the credibility of the policy
framework. A sound and stable macroeconomic framework is important in order to promote
a high and sustainable rate of economic growth and employment.
Fiscal policy
4. The central target for fiscal policy, adopted by the Government and Parliament, is to
maintain a surplus in general government finances equivalent to 2 per cent of GDP on
average over the business cycle. The main aim of this target is to strengthen the financial
position of the general government sector in preparation for the consequences of the
demographic changes that are expected over the coming decades. The surplus target is also
important for maintaining sufficient scope for countercyclical variations of the fiscal balance
without moving into a situation of excessive deficit.
5. The fiscal policy framework is further underpinned by the system of nominal expenditure
ceilings for the central government budget and a balanced budget requirement for the local
authorities. The Government agrees with the staff that the fiscal policy framework has
worked well, although it is not until recently that it has come under more considerable strain
due to weaker economic activity and increasing expenditure pressure at the local level.

-26. The Government remains firmly committed to the fiscal framework and the fiscal targets.
In last year’s Spring Fiscal Policy Bill the Government proposed a number of expenditure
cuts in order to avoid a breach of the expenditure ceilings. If the fiscal development turns out
to be weaker than expected, the Government is prepared to take further measures in order to
make sure that the expenditure ceilings are respected.
7. According to the projections of this year’s Spring Fiscal Policy Bill, fiscal developments
will by and large be in line with the surplus target over the coming years. According to the
current expenditure plans the structural surplus will gradually approach 2 per cent in 2006. In
order not to jeopardize the projected upswing in the labor market the Government is reluctant
to take further measures to increase the structural surplus until a decisive reduction in
unemployment has been achieved.
8. It should be emphasized that the surplus target for fiscal policy is considerably more
ambitious than those set by the EU within the Stability and Growth Pact. Also, the fiscal
performance of Sweden is still among the best in the EU and the OECD.
9. The Government has taken note of the proposals in the staff report regarding possible
measures to strengthen the fiscal policy framework and will consider them in the future
process of refining the framework. However, the Government does not share the staff’s view
on the need to trim back the welfare state in order to lower tax rates. Tax cuts will be
considered if they can be afforded, without jeopardizing the fiscal policy targets and the
quality of public services.
Monetary Policy
10. Monetary policy has since the previous consultation been conducted against the
background of sharply falling inflation in 2003 and in the beginning of 2004. The decline
was largely related to an expected downward adjustment in energy prices following on from
the large price rises in the beginning of 2003. Recurrent assessments that inflation one to two
years ahead would be somewhat below the inflation target have warranted a more
expansionary monetary policy. Consequently the Riksbank lowered the repo rate in two steps
in February and April from 2.75 to 2.0 per cent.
11. Looking ahead, inflation is expected to be relatively stable in the coming year after which
it is projected to increase gradually. Inflation is forecast to be in line with the Riksbank’s
target towards the end of the forecast period one to two years ahead. As also noted in the
staff report, one special circumstance is that Statistics Sweden has decided to change the way
it calculates the inflation rate as of January 2005. The rate of inflation as measured according
to the new method is expected to average 0.2 percentage points lower per year than with the
current method. The forecasts of inflation from January 2005 refer to the new definition. The
change in the definition of CPI inflation is thus expected to imply a sudden drop in the
registered inflation rate in January 2005. To avoid irregularity in monetary policy, however,
it may be appropriate to allow a purely technical change of this kind to filter through
gradually.

-312. The fact that the repo rate is low in historical terms indicates that it will need to be raised
in the longer term. However, the future stance of monetary policy will as usual depend on
new information on economic developments in Sweden and abroad and the effects these may
have on inflation prospects in Sweden.
13. The Riksbank agrees with the staff report that the krona is undervalued, although the
extent of this undervaluation is quite uncertain. The most recent inflation forecast was based
on an assumption of an appreciation of some two per cent during the coming two years.
14. The staff report raises the issue of the role of communication on monetary policy. In 1999
the Riksbank published a statement clarifying the general circumstances under which
deviations from the inflation target can be tolerated. The principles presented in that
statement have been applied since then and appear to be well understood by the financial
markets. The inflation target remains defined in terms of the CPI, but various definitions of
underlying inflation are used to characterize the persistent component of CPI inflation.
Nevertheless, it is always a difficult task to identify the sources of transitory movements in
inflation and present such analyses in a pedagogically simple and transparent way. The
Riksbank is continuously developing its methods to forecast the persistent movements in
inflation and a longer forecast horizon will be examined if this is deemed to be appropriate.
15. In line with the findings in the Financial Stability Report published in June, the Riksbank
agrees with the staff report that risks in the financial system appear well contained.
Structural policies
16. The Government agrees with the staff report that the key challenge of structural policies
over the coming years is to raise and maintain a high level of employment. The financing of
the Swedish welfare state is dependent on a high level of employment. An increase in
employment would also help contain the upward pressure on local government tax rates.
17. A target implying that at least 80 per cent of those between 20 and 65 years of age shall
be employed by the year 2004 has been adopted by the Government. According to current
projections the target will not be reached in 2004, partly due to unfavorable demographic
conditions.
18. The Government shares the staff concerns about sick leave developments. Several
measures have been taken to curb the negative trend of the last years. In addition to the
measures already implemented, the Government intends to present a new proposal for
dealing with the high sickness costs. According to this new proposal the employer will be
responsible for the first two weeks (instead of three) of sickness plus 15% of the cost for the
remaining sickness period or until the person is granted a more permanent benefit. The
purpose is to improve incentives for the employers to take active action to prevent and deal
with work-related sickness. Taken together, the planned and implemented measures are
expected to lead to a decline in the sick leave rate. There are already clear signs that the
number of people on sick leave has started to decline.

-419. The Government will closely monitor developments in sick leave and employment
figures, and will take action if needed to make sure that the corresponding targets are reached
over the medium term. Cutting replacement rates will not, however, be a preferred means of
achieving this as such a step would come into serious conflict with important social policy
objectives. Instead, the Government will rely on administrative controls and a more uniform
and strict application of existing rules.
20. The Government does not agree with the staff that the Swedish welfare state needs to be
scaled down in order to improve conditions for economic growth. There is no simple, straight
forward connection between the size of the welfare state and the economic growth of a
country. Over the last ten years the Swedish economy has done better than that of many other
OECD countries, despite the fact that the welfare state in Sweden is one of the largest in the
OECD area, as a percentage of GDP. In fact, many of the expenditure items that are
generally counted as part of the welfare state are likely to be positively connected with
economic growth as they support a high labor supply and thus a better economic
performance. This is in particular true for the subsidies to child care and the care for the
elderly.
21. The Government agrees with the staff report on the need to strengthen competition in
certain markets. The Government is aware of the problems in the housing market and the fact
that the current system is not working properly in all respects. The challenge is to find a
solution that does not compromise the fundamental principles of Swedish housing policy.
The desire to maintain strong tenure rights rules out a completely market-based system.
