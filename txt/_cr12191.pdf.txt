STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2012 ARTICLE IV CONSULTATION
June 22, 2012

KEY ISSUES
Context. The economy has cooled on the back of past policy tightening and drag from
global shocks. Stimulus has been provided since last fall and a gradual recovery is
expected. Growth in 2013‒14 should be back to potential of about 4 percent. Medium
term inflation expectations are well above the target mid-point which is a concern.
Boosting competitiveness and potential growth remain key items on the policy agenda.
Near term policy settings. The staff supports the policy mix of easy money and tight
fiscal. Under the current baseline, existing monetary policy settings are more than
sufficiently supportive. A key issue is timing the eventual unwinding of stimulus to keep
inflation on target in 2013. The continued adherence to the full 3.1 percent of GDP
primary fiscal surplus target is appropriate and will keep debt on a declining path.
Brazil retains effective tools to address transitory financial shocks and policy space to
counteract a large negative adverse shock to domestic output.
Rebalancing. Further efforts are needed to achieve a rebalancing of domestic demand
from consumption to foster saving and provide space for investment. This would lower
interest rates and the exchange rate and support potential growth and stability.
Financial stability. The FSAP–Update highlights that financial supervision and banking
system soundness are strong. As the financial system becomes more complex, some
further enhancements of the prudential framework will be needed. At the same time,
rapid credit growth is creating pockets of vulnerabilities, notably among consumers.
Strengthened monitoring of household risk and steps to further enhance the macroprudential framework will be helpful.
Policy response to past advice. In recent years the authorities have tightened fiscal
settings to contain the level of demand and emphasized the role of monetary policy as
the main countercyclical tool. Staff has supported this stance, stressing the importance
of recognizing the lags with which monetary policy has effects. The authorities have
seen the exchange rate adjust significantly, while using judiciously macro-policies and
intervention. There has been a convergence in views that use of capital flow
management measures to manage cyclical pressures is an appropriate part of this
policy tool-kit. There is a shared sense of the importance of boosting saving,
investment and competitiveness. The authorities are gradually taking steps here with
pension reform, use of concessions to boost investment, and ongoing tax reforms.

2012 ARTICLE IV REPORT

BRAZIL

CONTEXT
A. Challenges
1.
The past decade has seen a remarkable social transformation in Brazil, underpinned by
macroeconomic stability and rising living standards. A strong policy framework (fiscal
responsibility, inflation targeting and a flexible exchange rate), and improved income distribution
and social outcomes have been important accomplishments. Together with the combination of
rising terms of trade and economic and financial inclusion, this has supported sizable gains in
private consumption and some increase in investment. Financial stability has been underpinned by a
strong banking system and framework for regulation and supervision.
2.
Building on these gains will need higher investment and saving. Rebalancing demand
from consumption to investment and net exports would help to secure strong, balanced growth
going forward. Closing infrastructure gaps will help productivity and increase incentives for private
investment. Relatively low saving and consumption-led growth—financed in part by buoyant credit
expansion—have widened the current account deficit despite Brazil’s large resource exports and
substantial terms of trade gains. Demand rebalancing would begin to address these concerns, not
only enhancing potential growth but also reducing exchange rate overvaluation pressures, thereby
supporting external stability. The authorities have taken some important steps in this direction,
including recent pension and tax reforms.
3.
In the near term, navigating continued global turbulence en route to a sustained
recovery is a key challenge. During 2011, global shocks adversely affected confidence and trade,
contributing to the sharp deceleration of economic activity in the second half of the year, and risks
of further spillovers remain high. This complicates the challenge of calibrating domestic policy
settings. It will be key to allow sufficient time for current policy easing to play out, while standing
ready to take further action should downside risks materialize.

B. Cyclical state
4.
Growth surprised on the downside
last year. A policy tightening cycle was
appropriately launched during 2010‒11 to
cool overheating pressures and bring
inflation gradually back to target.
Macroprudential measures were also
introduced to reduce stability risks in
specific sectors. Earlier last year growth had
been expected to moderate from
7½ percent in 2010 to 4 percent in 2011. In
the event, activity stalled in 2011 Q3,
slowing more than expected to 2.7 percent
in 2011 (Figure 1). Indeed, the 2011 growth

outlook for Brazil experienced one of the largest downward revisions compared to important peers.
A number of factors could explain this larger-than-anticipated moderation. These include: (i) a
deterioration in global sentiment in the second semester also dented business confidence and
investment, (ii) a fall-off in intra-regional trade with Argentina, and (iii) tighter credit conditions in
certain market segments. The staff’s analysis suggests that the stronger exchange rate and rising
relative unit labor costs also contributed to the weakness in industrial production (see Annex I).

Monetary policy has since been eased substantially though activity remains subdued.
The central bank has lowered the policy rate by 400 bps since August 2011, to 8.5 percent. Growth
in 2012Q1 was 0.2 percent q/q (0.8 percent y/y), with weak investment and business confidence
and slowing trade volumes. Industrial output remains moribund. Indeed, the key automobile sector,
accounting directly for some 10 percent of industrial production, has been hard hit by falling
demand, reduced auto-loan financing by banks since early 2011, and disruptions in trade with
Argentina. The continued weakness of investment––which has contracted in the last several
quarters––is particularly striking. Nonetheless, consumption has recovered since the third quarter of
2011, growing at an annual rate of 4 percent, on the back of improving confidence and still tight
labor market conditions, including a 14 percent minimum wage increase.
6.
Inflation is falling but expectations have deteriorated. After peaking at 7.3 percent y/y in
September 2011, headline inflation has dropped to 5 percent y/y in May. This decline reflects to
some extent the unwinding of transitory supply factors and the effect of the normal periodic
updating of the index weights. The lagged impact of moderating growth and the negative output
gap on more sticky components of the index—including services—has also exerted some
downward pressure. On the other hand, while still at low levels (3.7 percent y/y in April), wholesale
price inflation has picked up in recent months, which could reflect incipient pass-through from the
weaker exchange rate (see ¶9). Moreover, medium-term inflation expectations have worsened due
to concerns about the level of rates and how quickly stimulus will be unwound as the economy
recovers. However, the swap curve has stayed well-anchored at the 2‒3 year horizon where trading
is liquid, while break-even inflation from inflation-linked bonds has so far showed only a small drift
upwards at longer horizons.

Consumer NPLs have drifted up, but overall financial stability conditions remain
strong. Consumer credit, especially for auto loans, picked up strongly in 2010 following the postLehman slump. In this period,

public banks even lower (2 percent
of loans). The system remains highly capitalized with overall low liquidity risks. More recently, the
authorities have replaced the management at a small bank (accounting for 0.2 percent of system
assets) following the discovery of some irregularities, with overall market reactions contained.
8.
The external current account was broadly unchanged last year. The trade balance
improved modestly as decelerating in export volumes were more than offset by terms of trade
gains and slowing imports—particularly in the second half of the year. This was partially balanced
by higher outflows for income and services, mostly reflecting higher profit and dividend payments
to foreign investors. In Jan‒April 2012, the trade surplus has moderated due to lower external
demand, declining prices for iron ore, and some drag from disturbances in regional trade.
9.
Capital flows had weakened as global risks increased, but picked-up again in recent
months. With calmer global conditions, capital flows and borrowing by residents picked up in the
first quarter, averaging US$8 billion per month, compared to US$4½ billion in the last quarter of
2011. However flows weakened in Q2 2012, with portfolio investments remaining moribund (and

some reductions in equity investments) and outflows of short term financing. However foreign
direct investment inflows (FDI) have remained buoyant and continue to largely fund the current
account.
10.
The exchange rate has weakened substantially this year, but remains well above the
average level of 2004‒08 (Figure 2). The real has depreciated almost 8½ percent this year against
the dollar (25 percent compared to July 2011 levels), equity markets have declined again recently
and external spreads have risen somewhat. While exchange rates have depreciated this year across
many emerging markets, the relative weakness of the real appears to reflect in part the downside
growth surprise, falling interest differentials, as well as the recent drop in commodity prices
important for Brazil, among other factors. However the local bond market has held up, reflecting
both expectations of lower interest rates and the strength of the domestic investor base.

C. Outlook and risks
11.
Activity is expected to pick up and grow above potential by end-2012. In the staff’s
baseline, under current policy settings, the economy should gain momentum during the second
half of the year, led by private domestic demand. The large minimum wage increase for 2012 is
boosting disposable income, given widespread links to wages and minimum pensions. Employment
creation, especially in the services sector remains strong. And the full effects of substantial
monetary easing—while somewhat slower in this cycle reflecting the effect of rising NPLs on the
transmission of monetary policy to lending rates and credit supply—should feed through by the
second semester, supported also by the expected drop in NPLs (see ¶33).1 After growing by
2.7 percent in 2011, output is expected to expand by over 4 percent q4/q4 in 2012 (though weak
carryover from 2011 will keep full year growth to 2½ percent). The output gap should close by late
2013 with the economy growing at about 4½ percent in the year and close to 4 percent thereafter.

Rising NPLs in principle can cause banks to increase spreads to cover credit losses. This could lead to a slower
response of lending rates to falls in policy rates if banks are seeking to boost income to build provisions/capital.

12.
Inflation is projected to hover just above the target mid-point through 2013 on the
assumption of future policy tightening. Tax cuts on consumer durables, a slowing economy, and
the absence of supply shocks or large corrections in administered prices should contribute to lower
inflation by the end of 2012. Some upward pressures are likely to reemerge in 2013, reflecting a
recovering economy and pass-through of exchange rate depreciation. The assumed withdrawal of
monetary stimulus (see ¶17) should facilitate inflation convergence back towards the target midpoint, but this process is expected to be gradual given the high inflation persistence and elevated
expectations. Upside risks to this baseline could arise during 2013 should the output gap close more
rapidly than anticipated in response to recent policy easing. Indeed, staff’s analysis (Annex II)
suggests that, if current policy settings are maintained through 2013, odds are that inflation will
remain well above the target mid-point.
13.
The staff considers that risks to the outlook are broadly balanced. The external
environment, notably the intensifying crisis in Europe, presents the most prominent downside risk in
the near term (see Risk Assessment Matrix).2 Important spillover channels include the potential for
tighter external financing conditions and lower commodity prices should shocks from Europe lead
to significantly lower global growth prospects. On the upside, lending from public banks is picking
up and may well contribute to accelerating overall credit growth by end-year putting pressure on
demand into 2013. Also, pass-through from the weaker exchange rate could increase given that the
process of sustained appreciation seems to have run its course for now, raising some upside
inflation risks.

Global and intra-regional spillovers have important effects on financial conditions and
growth in Brazil, while outward spillovers to near-neighbors can also be large (see Annex III).
Global spillovers to Brazil are felt through two main channels. First, the effects of commodity prices
are sizable, in part due to the increasing share of Brazil’s exports accounted for by primary products,
including some that are very sensitive to the global business cycle (e.g., iron ore). Second, capital
flows and asset prices. The last decade has seen a notable strengthening in Brazil’s international
investment position, but its role as a net capital importer and an emerging economy with relatively
deep financial markets means that Brazil remains susceptible to changes in global financial
conditions. Brazil is not especially vulnerable to spillovers relative to other G-20 emerging
economies. Its exposure to foreign banks is close to that of its peers and the local funding structure
of foreign subsidiaries mitigates risks of an adverse impact from foreign deleveraging. Its liability
structure is also more equity-based which facilitates more risk-sharing. In an intra-regional context,
disruptions to trade flows (including auto exports to Argentina) have had meaningful effects on
domestic activity. Spillovers from Brazil can also have large effects on the output of its nearest
neighbors, both directly but also due to its amplification of global financial shocks.
15.
Brazil faces important medium term challenges. In the staff’s medium term baseline,
potential output growth is envisaged at about 4 percent, in line with the growth pattern of the last
decade. There could be some downside risks for this, were the global crisis to be prolonged and
commodity prices to fall on a more sustained basis. Rising investment could offset these downsides
to potential growth, but for a balanced and sustainable growth trajectory, it would be important for
national saving to rise. At the current level of the real exchange rate, the external current account
deficit is projected to widen by over 1 percent of GDP in the medium term. This highlights the key
policy challenge facing Brazil discussed in section E on rebalancing to raise investment and savings.
With the current fiscal framework and objectives of a 3.1 percent of GDP primary balance being
maintained, gross public debt levels are expected to continue to fall––by almost 10 percent of GDP
in the medium term––reaching 55 percent of GDP by 2017. However, boosting public investment,
but financing this out of fiscal saving, is a key policy challenge going forward.

ISSUES FOR DISCUSSION
Focus of the Consultation: The fluid conjunctural environment, in the context of rapid credit
growth, strong capital flows and a somewhat overvalued exchange rate, provide a foil for
discussing key structural challenges that face Brazil. This year’s consultation focuses on three
issues that were discussed with the authorities. First, the appropriate near term macroeconomic
policy settings, under the baseline but also in the event of a significant external shock. Second, how
demand rebalancing can support sustainable growth and external stability. And lastly, financial
stability risks––including those arising from the lending boom––drawing on the FSAP Update.

A. What are the appropriate near term policy settings?

primary fiscal surplus target3 going forward, allowing monetary policy to act as the main
countercyclical policy tool. The authorities viewed that the economy was already slowing more than
expected and that external downside risks were large. They considered that this should allow policy
rates to be lowered substantially from the 12½ percent level then prevailing while bringing inflation
down towards the target mid-point.
17.
Monetary policy has been eased and fiscal settings are being tightened (Figure 3).
Starting with a cut last August that surprised markets, interest rates have been lowered significantly
and are currently at a historically low level (8½ percent). Meanwhile, the 2012 budget targets a
primary balance of 3.1 percent of GDP. Government has also announced treasury transfers to BNDES
of about 1¼ percent of GDP in 2012, unchanged from last year. Altogether, these imply continued
spending restraint and a structural fiscal withdrawal of about 1 percent of GDP in 2012 (both with
and without BNDES lending). Fiscal settings are assumed to remain broadly neutral in 2013 and
beyond with a primary surplus of 3.1 percent of GDP being maintained in the medium term. This
should pull gross debt down from 65 percent of GDP in 2011 to 55 percent of GDP by 2017.

The authorities broadly agree that the economic recovery should gather momentum in
the second half of 2012––there was shared concern that inflation expectations have risen. They
noted that credit quality and new concessions are expected to increase as the year progresses,
supporting the fuller transmission of monetary policy stimulus (see ¶10). The central bank in recent
communications has signaled that low rates will be maintained for some time and this has tended to
flatten out the swap curve through end-2012. However, many analysts have concurrently marked-up
expectations for medium term inflation. While inflation is expected to converge at end-2012,
medium-term inflation expectations are now at their highest level above the target mid-point since
it was set at 4½ percent in 2005. The authorities noted that the central bank’s decision to start
easing last year had been met with much opposition from market participants, but that its
assessment had in the event been validated by events. They also viewed that exchange rate passthrough would be contained by the weak cyclical state and that key challenges for policy

Under the fiscal rule, the target could be lowered to allow higher investment, which in some scenarios this year
could bring the primary surplus target down to 2.6 percent of GDP.

formulation in the current context arose from two factors: uncertainties over the baseline external
outlook, and structural shifts in key macro parameters in Brazil. On the latter, they considered that
the real neutral interest rate in Brazil had been declining in the last years and considered that rates
could fall to a lower level in the current cycle.4
19.
The discussion emphasized the timing of when to start unwinding stimulus. Under the
staff’s baseline scenario, monetary settings are now more than sufficiently supportive. The key issue
to keep under review will be the timing of the start of the normalization cycle to support the
convergence of inflation back to target through 2013‒14. In the absence of a large adverse external
shock and given the rise in inflation expectations, the staff argued that the authorities should stand
ready to unwind some monetary stimulus through 2013 and before the end of this year if needed to
keep inflation on target during 2013‒14. The staff recognized that the neutral policy rate has likely
been shifting down through time but noted there remains considerable uncertainty with regards to
its level (See Annex IV). The authorities stressed that they were committed to meeting the inflation
target over the relevant horizon and would take action as appropriate.
20.
Staff noted that while fiscal policy implementation had been strong, some risks could
arise in the constrained budgetary environment. There was agreement that the authorities had
sent a strong signal of commitment to their fiscal strategy by adhering to the full unadjusted
primary balance target of 3.1 percent of GDP last year. Nonetheless, spending pressures linked to
the large minimum wage increase this year and some moderation in tax revenues (particularly
corporate taxes), including from stimulus measures, could put pressure on budget implementation.5
This arises in part because with Brazil’s highly rigid spending structure—with over 80 percent of
spending pre-committed—finding spending cuts to adhere to the fiscal target is complex (as shown
in Annex V). As such, keeping the fiscal program on track may require increased resort to
extraordinary revenues or other one-offs. The authorities stressed that they always follow a cautious
approach in managing the execution of budget spending and stressed their commitment to
meeting the full unadjusted primary target.6 Moreover, they noted that exceptional revenues
generally reflected investment income from public sector corporations and management of
government assets and that so-called one-off revenues had in practice turned out to be quite stable.
21.
There was a consensus that Brazil was well-placed to deal with downside risks.
International reserves are now US$370 billion, compared to US$200 billion in mid-2008. Liquidity
buffers at commercial banks have likewise increased and currently stand at some 10 percent of GDP.
4

As indicated in past consultations, the authorities have had a somewhat different assessment of potential growth
than staff (4½–5½ vs. 3¾–4¼ percent). However, there was agreement that the long-lasting effects of the crisis may
act to pull potential growth in Brazil––as in other countries––somewhat lower than previously considered, though
further analysis will be needed.
5

Increases in the minimum wage are reflected in the minimum pensions and other social benefits, with an estimated
fiscal cost of ½ percent of GDP in 2012.
6

The Ministry of Finance retains very strong discretionary control of the budget execution and also has space under
law to deviate from earmarks within specific limits.

14

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

BRAZIL 2012 ARTICLE IV REPORT

Also, the complex corporate f/x derivatives that played a large role in undermining confidence in key
emerging markets in 2008 are no longer in use while corporate external leverage—both in
aggregate and across firms––remains low, notwithstanding the increased issuance in the last year.
Nonetheless, it was agreed that growth is weaker (running now at an annual rate of about 1 percent
compared to 4½ percent in early 2008). Furthermore, the staff noted that public sector bank balance
sheets have already been expanded substantially since 2008 which could constrain their capacity to
act as counter-cyclical tools. The authorities emphasized that public banks were prudently managed
and had sufficient depth to again step in and play a counter-cyclical role if needed.
22.
The authorities agreed that the flexible exchange rate and liquidity provision would be
the first policy tools deployed in the event of shocks. Substantial experience had been gained
during 2008-09 in setting up f/x and local currency liquidity facilities to address strains in specific
sectors, including related to trade finance. These mechanisms were now easy/quick to activate and
well understood by market participants. There was agreement that were a shock similar in
magnitude to that in 2008 to arise, monetary policy could now respond aggressively with the recent
removal of the implicit floor on the policy rate.7 In the event, staff also view that there is sufficient
space for fiscal policy to be eased should an external shock lead to a large adverse impact on
domestic output (indeed, current public debt levels remain broadly in line with pre-Lehman ones, in
stark contrast to much of the rest of the world). The staff cautioned against excess efforts to
stimulate demand before such an external shock materializes, including through using an overly
wide range of instruments and ad hoc fiscal incentives that could increase distortions and
undermine the business environment and investment. The authorities reaffirmed their intent to rely
on monetary policy as the main counter-cyclical tool in the event of downside risks.

B. How can rebalancing support external stability and sustained growth?
23.
Brazil has a relatively low rate of saving and investment by comparison with peers
(Figure 4). Household saving is especially modest, in part reflecting a generous pension system.8
Investment levels are also low in comparison to other G-20 emerging markets (including ex-China),
given structurally high real interest rates, burdensome taxation, and infrastructure gaps. Moreover, a
key feature of the Brazilian economy is the constrained level of savings and investment by the public
sector in comparison to global peers. While both savings and investment have increased in the last
years, levels remain modest and the current account deficit has widened despite Brazil’s large
resource exports. The counterpoint to this pattern of growth has been that the share of
consumption in income in Brazil has risen far more than in most global peers in the last decade.

7

Previously, savings deposits offered a minimum guaranteed return roughly equivalent to about 8½ percent. In such
a situation, were the SELIC rate to drop below that level, money market investors would have had incentives to shift
funds from money/short-term debt instruments into savings deposits, potentially disrupting the former. In early May,
government effectively removed this floor for new depositors.
8

Brazil is unique in having only 10 percent of the population over the age of 65, but spending about 9 percent of
GDP on pensions. See Chapter I of the Selected Issues Paper (www.imf.org) for an international comparison.

appreciated than those in
2004. Similar results are obtained from equilibrium exchange rate models. The staff has also
constructed measures of the real exchange rate for Brazil deflated by relative manufacturing unit
labor costs which suggest a level that is currently about 10 percent more appreciated than relative
price based measures. Indeed, staff analysis suggests that rising relative ULCs for Brazil, coupled
with the lagged effects of the post-Lehman nominal appreciation, have dented industrial production
in the last couple of years (see Appendix).

These norms are derived from cross-country regressions explaining current accounts as a function of various
fundamentals and controlling for relative cyclical effects (from the CGER and EBA) and also including adjustments for
appropriate relative policies (from the EBA).
10

The impact of resources on the current account raises uncertainties over the assessment. On the one hand the
current account deficit at 2005 commodity prices was 4½ percent of GDP in 2011. But Brazil is expected to become a
major oil producer based on the offshore pre-sal finds. At this stage net oil exports are projected to rise to 1 percent
of GDP in the longer term. However, these could prove to be larger (Box 1).

Box 1. Brazil: Oil Sector Developments and Prospects1
In the next decade Brazil is set to become one of the world’s major oil economies. With current oil
production at 2 million barrels per day (mbbl/d), the country falls a little short of balancing its oil exports
and imports, and ranks 15th in the world in terms of its proven oil reserves (15 billion barrels). However, the
discovery in 2007 of the offshore “pre-sal” oilfields (the most significant recent global oil field discovery) is
estimated to add from 50 to 100 billion barrels to Brazil’s probable and potential reserves and help boost oil
production by almost 3 mbbl/d by 2020, making Brazil one of the top-five oil economies in the world.
Brazil’s national oil company, Petrobras, is already producing more than 100 thousand barrels per day from
the pre-sal oilfields.

To be a major oil producer the country has to overcome considerable challenges related to the
technological complexity of pre-sal development and exploration, high investment needs, and
capacity constraints that partially reflect strict local-content rules. Development of pre-sal reserves will
require utilization of cutting edge technologies related to drilling, extracting, and transporting oil and gas
that lie up to 300km offshore, beneath up to 5 km of salt and rock. While Petrobras already has extensive
experience with offshore oil fields—accounting for more than 20 percent of the world’s deepwater
production—developing pre-sal is no small challenge. The company plans to invest more than
US$220 billion over the next 5 years—almost 10 percent of GDP—to develop the fields and build onshore
downstream facilities. In addition, relatively high local-content requirements for pre-sal projects—that are
currently at about 50‒60 percent of total costs and set to increase to 90 percent over the medium term as a
local industry adapts—may create near-term production bottlenecks, particularly given the ambitious
production targets.

Forthcoming oil export receipts will gradually
improve Brazil’s external balance. While at present
the development of the pre-sal fields generates
negative net current account flows reflecting high
capital import needs, increasing oil exports are
projected to improve the current account balance by
almost 2 percent of GDP over the next decade.

Box 1. Brazil: Oil Sector Developments and Prospects (Concluded)
Large petroleum reserves create new opportunities and challenges. The Brazilian government recently
introduced regulatory changes aimed to increase its share of pre-sal revenues and mitigate investor’s risks
related to exploration by commencing production sharing agreements for future pre-sal fields and raising
royalties (from 5 percent to 10+ percent for certain high yielding fields). The exact distribution of oil
revenues among federal government, states, and municipalities is still under review. Prudent use of oil
receipts could be a crucial element to increase the country’s low savings rate, develop domestic value added
industry and services to support the oil sector, and address infrastructure and socials needs. The government
plans to invest part of oil revenues in education, science, and research, which in principle should help raise
productivity in the non-oil sectors and mitigate potential Dutch disease type effects on competiveness.

The authorities agreed that the currency remained on the strong side, notwithstanding
the recent depreciation, but stressed the role of global push factors. The authorities and staff
concurred that capital flows averaging 4 percent of GDP in the last 3 years have exacerbated
exchange rate pressures. However, the authorities emphasized the importance of global push
factors, including ultra-easy monetary policy in major reserve currency areas. They felt that the
appreciation of the nominal exchange rate during 2009‒11H1 has likely contributed to the
disappointing performance of the manufacturing sector in Brazil following the post-Lehman
bounce-back, including by association with a surge of manufactured imports. Indeed, they argued
that the role of relative labor costs may be less important given that manufacturing in Brazil had
grown more capital intensive in recent years. Reflecting the ongoing pressures, some measures have
been introduced in the past year to support industry, including increased taxes on imports and
renegotiation of trade arrangements for vehicles. The authorities noted that they were taking steps
in line with their regional trade agreements to maintain a balanced pattern of trade, while also
ensuring that these adhered to their multilateral commitments. On the current account assessment,
they noted that the current account deficit in Brazil since 1970 had averaged about 2 percent of
GDP, close to that for 2011. Moreover, they suggested that had Brazil not experienced large terms of
trade gains and associated wealth effects in the second half of the 2000’s, the non-commodity trade
balance would have been stronger.
26.
Higher saving would help lower interest rates and the exchange rate, boosting growth
over the medium term. The staff recognized that increasing domestic saving is complex and likely
to take time. The recent reforms of the public pension system mark a modest yet important initial
step in the process of lowering its long-term funding gap.11 Simulations prepared by staff point also
to some gains on private savings from this reform and show that for the same fiscal savings,
alternative reforms can have very different macroeconomic effects (see Box 2).
11

The reform shaves off about ½ percentage point of GDP from the about 7 percentage point of GDP long-term
deterioration in the deficit of the social security system that was projected before the reform.

Box 2. Brazil: Public Pension Reform––What Impact on Savings Rates and Growth?1
Aggregate savings in Brazil are constrained by the generous public pension system. Not only does the
overall deficit of pension system reduce government savings (social security deficit was 2.3 percent of GDP
in 2011), the very high replacement rates it offers (close to or above 80 percent) reduces incentives for
households’ savings.
The recent introduction of a defined contribution pillar for public sector workers will encourage
higher private savings. The reform caps the defined benefits accrued by future federal government
employees (and accordingly limits social security contributions). Both the expectation of lower transfers
during retirement and the lower contribution rate––higher disposable income––enhance incentives to save
and increase labor supply.
Reforms that generate the same fiscal savings can have very different effects on macro variables.
Simulations using the Fund’s Global Integrated Monetary and Fiscal model (GIMF) show that for equivalent
long term fiscal savings, the largest impact on private savings would come from introduction of a defined
contribution pillar. Raising Brazil’s low retirement age (under 60 on average) would tend to reduce savings
(given higher lifetime earnings and shorter retirement period) but have larger positive effects on growth
given increased labor supply. Lowering replacement rates would have more intermediate effects.
Nonetheless, it is worth noting that the growth impacts vary substantially depending on the horizon
considered as also illustrated in the Figure below.

1 percent of GDP) in the deficit of the pension system in the long run.

Additional measures to encourage long term savings can also be considered. Tax measures to
incentivize savings are frequently considered, though the empirical analysis of their effectiveness is mixed.
On the one hand, marginal propensities to save seem to respond little to changes in interest rates and when
there is a response (among higher income earners) it consists often in a composition (portfolio) effect.2 On
the other hand, policies that address pervasive behavioral distortions, such as habit persistence or myopia
have had more success. Indeed mandatory retirement saving schemes have been a first line option (with
empirically higher effects among middle to low income households), but choice engineering––automatic
enrollment in savings schemes with a well designed ‘default’ option, or financial education––can also be
effective. Finally, while financial development reduces borrowing constraints, it expands the set of savings
instruments available to households and corporates (in terms of return, maturity and hedging opportunities)
and can thus have a positive impact on savings in the long run.

Indeed, reducing high benefit levels would boost saving and tend to lower Brazil’s
structurally high interest rates, further reducing capital flow pressures. The authorities
recognized these benefits, but stressed the important role of the pension system in redistributing
income and providing a social safety net for the poorest. Moreover, they noted that boosting
consumption and living standards for poorer groups had been a singular achievement in Brazil.
Looking ahead, they suggested that as financial deepening continued to gain traction in Brazil, this
could support increased saving by broadening savings options for households.
28.
The authorities noted that efforts to boost overall investment were generating results
and stressed the importance they placed on maintaining social spending. They highlighted
gains made through the Growth Acceleration Program (PAC) which have contributed to raising
public investment from 2 percent of GDP in 2006 to 2½ percent of GDP in 2011, while also boosting
private investment. They added that a large share of investment in Brazil was carried out by large
publically owned companies (e.g. Petrobras has an investment program of some 10 percent of GDP
over the next 5 years) and that a key priority now was to improve the execution of investment
projects at the federal level. Government has also sought to use concessions to move key
infrastructure projects forward. Funding for many of these investments was being provided by the
national development bank BNDES. The staff welcomed efforts to boost investment, including
leveraging savings and expertise from the private sector. However, it stressed that to maximize
beneficial macroeconomic effects, it was crucial that additional investment be financed out of higher
public saving. Indeed, research by staff for the consultation looking at the impact of fiscal policy on
the real exchange rate in emerging markets flags the positive role that can be played by higher
public investment financed out of saving, supporting competitiveness and growth.12 Staff
emphasized the need for freeing up space on budget within the constraint of primary fiscal target,
preferably by containing the growth of non-core consumption spending. The staff noted that this
was an additional powerful motivation for seeking to reduce spending rigidities, including by
exploring options for de-linking pension adjustments from the minimum wage.
29.
Tax reform could also contribute to increasing competitiveness. Brazil’s tax system is
particularly burdensome due to its complexity, fragmentation and changing provisions which
increase the cost of doing business. Indeed, the authorities have identified tax reform as one of their
main priorities with the objective of simplifying the system and eliminating distortions. Staff
concurred with the authorities that the approval of legislation to reduce the states’ VAT rates (ICMS)
for imported goods and the decision to make tax breaks conditional on unanimity among states are
important steps in this direction and should help reduce tax competition. Plans for a broader reform
of the state VAT (ICMS) system—which will result in the unification of rates—are also under
discussion. As some states may lose revenue, several incentives are being explored to facilitate the
transition but authorities stressed their commitment to preserving the strength of the fiscal
framework. Proposals for the simplification of cascading taxes such as the funding for social security

BRAZIL

(COFINS) and the funding for retirement pensions (PIS) are also under study. In the past, the staff
has noted that options could include merging these taxes into a single VAT-like consumption tax
and reforming or eliminating most tax exemptions.
30.
The authorities and staff agreed there is scope for capital market reform to support
rebalancing. Financial instruments in Brazil—especially for private agents—remain overwhelmingly
short term in nature, linked in most cases to the overnight rate. Measures to develop the longer end
of the yield curve could boost saving and should facilitate longer term investments. The authorities
stressed that towards this end they were seeking to increase the share of fixed rate bonds in total
public debt issuance. Other steps are being taken to improve secondary market liquidity, build a
solid benchmark yield curve and extend the average maturity of the debt. Initial steps are also being
taken to standardize issuance terms for new private bonds. There is also substantial scope to
leverage the expertise of BNDES to support capital market development in Brazil (see the
accompanying FSSA (www.imf.org)).
31.
In the transition, intervention and CFMs can help manage cyclical capital flow
pressures. While the flexible exchange rate has borne the brunt of past capital flow pressures, the
authorities have appropriately adjusted macro policies and accumulated reserves. Intervention has
been focused on avoiding extreme volatility in the exchange rate. Staff noted that reserves were
now at the top end of a range of adequacy metrics and that sterilization was particularly costly in
Brazil. The authorities considered that given continued elevated global risks, there remained a
premium for some further reserve accumulation. Capital flow management measures have also been
introduced in past periods of pressure and have had some effect on containing exchange rate
strength (portfolio debt flows have been much reduced) albeit the impact of specific measures on
the exchange rate per se has tended to attenuate over time. The authorities emphasized that they
view these measures as being used temporarily in managing cyclical capital flow pressures. Indeed,
they noted that in practice, implementation of the framework has been countercyclical—when flow
pressures have diminished or reversed, the framework has been eased.13 Furthermore, measures
have been used to also ward off stability risks.14 All told, the authorities viewed that they have
sought, with some success, to steer flows away from shorter-term and carry-related activities, to
more stable, investment-related funding.

C. What are the risks to financial stability from rapid credit growth?
32.
The authorities welcomed the recognition in the Financial Sector Assessment Program
Update (FSAP) of the strength of financial sector regulation and supervision in Brazil. On
banking, the risk-based supervisory process is intrusive and there is a remarkably high degree of
compliance with the Basel Core Principles. On capital markets, transparency and disclosure
13

As for example in September 2011 when the IOF on equity transactions was lowered from 2 to 0 percent as capital
flows diminished and the exchange rate depreciated rapidly.

14

For example when shorter maturity lending picked up again at the start of 2012, durations limits for exemption
from the IOF were extended from two to five years. This measure has subsequently been reversed.

22

BRAZIL 2012 ARTICLE IV REPORT

standards have been raised. On insurance and pensions, the operational independence of
supervisors needs to be strengthened. Common challenges for all supervisors are coping with
constraints on budgets and human resources, and ensuring adequate legal protection. As the
financial system becomes more complex, coordination among the various supervisory bodies will
become increasingly important. A summary of specific policy recommendations made in the FSAP–
Update is presented in Box 3 while additional details are in the accompanying FSSA.
33.
There was agreement also that the banking system was in aggregate well-positioned
to absorb even large shocks (Figure 5). FSAP stress tests show that the system is very well placed to
deal with very severe shocks. In a scenario where growth is a cumulative 12 percentage points below
baseline in 2012−13, among other factors, and with conservative assumptions about the level of
true economic capital available, most banks need no further capital. The authorities noted that they
intend to move ahead with early implementation of countercyclical capital charges under Basel III.
Replacement of deferred tax assets, which are an important part of the capital base for some banks,
will be phased in under the Basel III timetable. The authorities expect banks to be able to generate
sufficient internal capital to manage this transition.
34.
Liquidity risks are also manageable. Banks hold over 10 percent of GDP in required
reserves at the central bank and about 13 percent of their assets are government bonds. As such,
liquidity and market stress tests run by the FSAP find the system again well-positioned. However as
well known, small and medium banks remain vulnerable given their dependence on wholesale
funding. The authorities have taken some steps to begin consolidation. Moreover larger banks are
allowed to discount from their required reserves, credit portfolios they purchase from smaller bank.
While this creates an incentive to maintain funding for smaller banks, the staff expressed concern
that in steady state this arrangement could introduce distortions in the reserve requirement
framework. The authorities noted that they are seeking durable solutions, including in the form of
having consolidated issuances of debt by smaller banks to create scale in this market and relieve
their funding constraints.
35.
Staff highlighted that rapid trend credit growth bore close monitoring, while noting
that aggregate debt levels remain low and the credit gap is closing. The credit-to-GDP ratio in
Brazil has risen from 26 percent in 2004 to 49 percent in 2011. The staff noted that credit booms of
this duration and magnitude have been associated with risks to stability in cross-country studies
(see Annex VII).15 Nonetheless, there was agreement echoed by the FSAP-Update, that a significant
portion of this increase likely reflects financial deepening. With the gains on income and inclusion
post-2003, new borrowers have obtained access to finance. Legal reforms have substantially
strengthened creditor rights. Moreover, the overall level of financial development remains low by
international standards, a factor that lowers stability risks. In the current cycle, the credit gap has
also started to shrink.16 Furthermore, the large buffers in the system remain a major mitigant of
systemic risk as discussed in the previous paragraph.

Box 3. Brazil: Financial System Assessment––Achievements and Challenges1
Brazil’s financial system has grown in size and sophistication and strengthened its resilience to
shocks. Over the past decade, financial assets doubled to 180 percent of GDP, of which, more than half are
held by depository institutions. Financial deepening has taken place hand in hand with economic growth
and greater financial inclusion. Meanwhile, the supervisory and regulatory frameworks for banking, capital
markets and insurance have been substantially strengthened. Profitability has been consistently high,
solvency ratios are strong, exposure to cross-border and foreign exchange risk is limited, and liquidity ratios
are favorable.
These strengths notwithstanding, some challenges remain to be addressed. As the system grows in size
and sophistication, strengthening the effectiveness of the crisis resolution framework and coordination
among the various supervisory agents is becoming increasingly important. Moreover, rapid credit growth
has created some vulnerabilities, notably with respect to indebted households and rapidly rising housing
prices in prime locations.
A summary of the key FSAP recommendations to address these challenges includes (see the Brazil FSSA
(www.imf.org) for more details):





Establishing a multipartite high-level committee including all financial regulators with an explicit
mandate for financial stability and crisis coordination.
Issuing a regulation on credit bureaus to ensure broad availability of information on borrowers with
good payment history.
Publication of a national housing price index based on purchases.

Safety Nets and Crisis management



Improving the operational procedures and systems for providing emergency liquidity assistance
(ELA) by the central bank.
Removing some legal impediments and strengthening the purchase and assumption and bridge
bank statutes.
Extending legal protection to all financial sector supervisory agencies, and elevating the threshold
for actions against employees of these agencies, BCB-appointed directors, intervenors, or
liquidators to gross negligence.
Reinforcing procedures for the use of the deposit insurance fund (FGC) by establishing that the FGC
provides funding beyond least cost assistance only to cases where there is a systemic threat and
capped at 50 percent of FGC’s cash resources. Securing adequate funding for the FGC in the event
of a systemic crisis.

Capital Markets




Extending tax incentives on infrastructure bonds to infrastructure funds.
Refocusing BNDES operations towards facilitating long-term financing while disengaging gradually
from low-risk commercial activities.
Issuing stricter market-making rules with the aim of strengthening secondary market trading.

Insurance and Pensions
 Enhancing the operational autonomy and legal protection of insurance and pension supervisors.
 Implementing the required regulation for consolidated supervision.

The staff stressed that household credit risk and rising house prices are a concern.



House prices in prime urban areas have more than doubled over the last 4‒5 years, as has
housing credit––albeit from a low level going from about 2 percent of GDP in 2006 to 4 percent
of GDP last year. Much of this new lending is from the public housing bank, with a special
emphasis on low-income borrowers. The staff urged the authorities to strengthen data on the
housing sector, including on price statistics.

noted that public banks were supervised and regulated in the same manner as private banks
and were subject to the same prudential and capital requirements. They noted that private
banks had cut back on lending in a pro-cyclical fashion reflecting legacy decisions from the 2010
boom and that public sector banks were taking advantage of opportunities they were presented
with to gain some market share.


Macroprudential measures. Macroprudential policies (MaPs) have been used to contain
financial stability risks in certain market segments.18 The authorities stressed that MaPs were
aimed at stability considerations, leaving cyclical management to monetary policy. In this
context, MaPs were viewed as being complements to monetary policy. Looking forward, staff
noted that this would be an opportune time to introduce more broad-based measures to
manage credit-cycle related stability risks. The authorities noted that they were considering
advancing implementation of the counter-cyclical capital charge conceived under the Basel III
agenda. There was agreement that critical details needed to be worked out, including on how to
calibrate the charge and whether there should be different levels for different types and sizes of
intermediaries. It was noted that this remains an open issue in the international debate on Basel
III implementation, but the authorities stressed their commitment to advance here. Moreover,
they noted that Brazil implements already a risk based provisioning framework which in many
ways mimics a counter-cyclical capital regime.

38.
Staff suggested that it would be opportune also to conduct a strategic review of the
role and size of BNDES. Brazil has traditionally had a major developmental role for public banks.
However, BNDES’s balance sheet has grown from 7½ percent of GDP in 2007 to 14 percent of GDP
in 2011. The increase was due to its counter-cyclical lending role to avoid a credit crunch during the
crisis. Staff suggested that going forward, consideration could be given for BNDES to gradually
disengage from commercial activities (including its large lending to prime corporates who have
access to other financing), and instead focus on developing a market for long-term finance. BNDES
could seek to fund co-financing of infrastructure projects with the private sector, for example. The
authorities noted that BNDES will remain a key factor in their development strategy. Plans were
already underfoot to leverage BNDES expertise in capital market development while it was already
expanding its role in funding long-term infrastructure and energy investments.

STAFF APPRAISAL
39.
The staff welcomes the important shift in the policy mix that was announced last fall.
The commitment to maintain the 3.1 percent of GDP primary surplus target during 2012‒13 and
letting monetary policy act as the main countercyclical tool is well geared to support demand and
18

Targeted MaPs were introduced in late 2010 in auto, credit card, and personal loans. A key feature included raising
capital requirements for longer duration lending. For example, 7 year auto loans were being extended for an asset
that depreciates over 5 years. Moreover, with consumers more sensitive to changes in their monthly payments, it was
important to contain an expansion of duration overall to increase the transmission of tighter monetary policy (else
banks were increasing duration, with unchanged monthly payments, in response to their higher cost of funds).

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

2012 ARTICLE IV REPORT

BRAZIL

external stability. From a macroeconomic perspective, fiscal policy should focus on increasing saving
over the medium term and bringing gross debt down through the cycle. This will further highlight
the relatively strong fiscal position of Brazil. Monetary policy can react nimbly and powerfully to
shocks to support the level of demand.
40.
Monetary policy has been appropriately eased and current settings are very supportive.
Under the staff’s baseline scenario, policy rates around current levels are sufficient to support a
robust cyclical recovery starting in the second half of 2012. The key issue to keep under review will
be the pace and timing of the start of the normalization cycle to facilitate inflation convergence back
to target during 2013. In the absence of an adverse external shock, and given the rise in inflation
expectations and the hard won disinflation gains of the past decade, the staff believes that the
authorities should stand ready to unwind monetary stimulus through 2013 and before the end of
this year if needed. Nonetheless, the staff recognizes that real interest rates may stabilize at a
somewhat lower level than in past cycles.
41.
The established fiscal target is welcome and meeting it is important. The delivery of the
full unadjusted fiscal target in 2011 has sent an important signal of the authorities’ commitment to
their policy strategy. Looking ahead to 2012‒13, Brazil’s relatively low saving, and the need to
continue to build policy buffers, raise the stakes for adhering to the full unadjusted primary surplus
target of 3.1 percent of GDP in this period. This will also help contain risks to the external current
account that could arise, including were commodity prices to fall from current levels. Containing
primary current spending growth would also be important to create space for higher investment.
42.
The flexible exchange rate and central bank liquidity provision should remain the
natural first external shock absorbers. The authorities have built sizable buffers in the shape of
international reserves and liquid resources of banks. Should spillovers extend from the financial
sector to the real economy, there remains substantial scope to ease monetary policy following the
welcome removal of the floor on saving deposit interest rates. There is some room to ease fiscal
policy settings were a severe demand shock and tightening of credit conditions in line with the
experience during the Lehman crisis to arise. In the interim, staff would advise against the excessive
use of a wide range of alternative policy tools, including use of ad hoc fiscal incentives that could be
difficult to reverse and have unforeseen costs.
43.
Brazil would be well served by rebalancing from consumption to investment and net
exports to foster growth and external stability. The saving rate in Brazil is below that of most G20 emerging economies, in part reflecting a generous pension system. Investment is also subdued in
comparison to peers, given structurally high real interest rates, a complex tax system and
infrastructure gaps. While both saving and investments have increased in the last years, levels
remain low and the current account deficit has widened despite Brazil’s large resource exports.
Further, raising saving and investment are critical for supporting Brazil’s competitiveness, especially
in relation to its high saving peers. These are also needed to boost potential growth and labor
productivity.

28

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

BRAZIL 2012 ARTICLE IV REPORT

44.
These domestic imbalances, along with strong capital inflows, have contributed to a
misalignment of the exchange rate. In particular, low domestic saving is associated with a
relatively high level of the exchange rate. While the real exchange rate has depreciated from peak
levels observed in mid-2011, it remains on the strong side reflecting continued imbalances.
Moreover, relative unit labor costs for Brazil have increased by more than inflation differentials since
mid-2009. Furthermore, strong capital flows have exacerbated exchange rate pressures. The staff’s
analysis suggests that combined with the appreciation of the nominal exchange rate during this
period, rising relative labor costs may have contributed to the sluggish performance of industry in
Brazil, highlighting the importance of measures to boost productivity.
45.
Measures are needed to boost investment financed out of higher domestic saving. This
could be achieved by addressing budget rigidities to create more space for public investment.
Indeed, evidence from emerging economies flags the positive role that can be played by higher
public investment financed out of savings for lowering the real exchange rate. Reforms in support of
developing the longer end of the yield curve could facilitate long term investments. The staff
welcomes steps to increase the average maturity of the public debt and promote the corporate
bond market. BNDES could continue to play a major role in this process by focusing on developing a
market for long-term finance and gradually disengaging from commercial activities, including
lending to prime corporates who have access to other financing.
46.
Staff welcomes the recent reforms of the tax and pension systems. Steps taken to
improve the tax system will help improve competitiveness and lower distortions. Proposals for
further reform of the states’ VAT should ensure that compensatory measures for the states are
revenue-neutral and do not compromise the integrity of the fiscal framework. Further simplification
of the complex federal tax system would help reduce the cost of doing business. The recently
approved public pension reform—while having a relatively small fiscal impact—is an important step
towards increasing saving to finance investment.
47.
Capital flow management measures (CFMs) have played a useful part in managing
cyclical pressures in Brazil. The authorities have used a combination of tools to cope with capital
inflows, including allowing the flexible exchange rate to appreciate, intervention in the foreign
exchange market, macroeconomic policies, and CFMs. The CFMs have also been applied
appropriately in a countercyclical manner, being eased when capital flows have reversed. While
capital flow pressures have diminished in the current “risk-off” environment, overall global financing
conditions are likely to remain easy for some time. As such, CFMs will remain part of the tool-kit to
manage any future strong capital flows, though as the economy rebalances and absorptive capacity
increases there should be less need for such measures.
48.
Brazil’s financial sector regulation and supervision are strong. This was a central
conclusion of the recent Financial Sector Assessment Program Update (FSAP). In banking, the riskbased supervisory process is robust and with a high degree of compliance with the Basel Core
Principles. Insurance and capital markets supervision has become more risk-based and compliance
with international standards has improved in tandem. Challenges for the supervisory framework,

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

29

2012 ARTICLE IV REPORT

BRAZIL

include coping with constraints on budget and human resources, ensuring adequate legal
protection and enhancing the operational independence of insurance and pensions supervisors.
49.
Large macro-financial linkages are contained by the strength of the system. FSAP stress
tests show that the banking system in general is very well placed to deal with even severe shocks.
The planned early implementation of elements of Basel III is a testament to the strength of the
system. The expectation is that banks should be able to generate sufficient internal capital to
manage this transition. However, a close eye will need to be kept on bank profitability as spreads
could be compressed going forward, reducing returns, while duration will likely increase, raising
interest rate and liquidity risks.
50.
The system is also well-placed to manage shocks to liquidity and market conditions.
Liquidity and market stress tests run by the FSAP find the system again well-positioned to manage
strains, including those that could arise from tail risks such as in the Lehman episode. Some issues
remain regarding the structure of funding in parts of the small and medium banking sector which
the authorities are closely monitoring.
51.
Credit has grown very fast in the last decade. The credit-to-GDP ratio in Brazil has risen
from 26 percent in 2004 to 49 percent in 2011. Credit booms of this duration and magnitude have
been associated with risks to stability in cross-country studies. However, as noted by the FSAP, a
significant portion of this increase in Brazil reflects financial deepening. With the gains on income
and inclusion post-2003, new borrowers have obtained access to finance. Legal reforms have
substantially strengthened creditor rights. Moreover, the overall level of financial development
remains low by international standards, which is associated with lower stability risks.
52.
Though the system is resilient, some pressure-points will bear close monitoring going
forward. First, household indebtedness has risen rapidly. Moreover, the aggregate debt service
burden appears high relative to peers, and non-performing loans have increased in early 2011
despite strong employment conditions. Second, real estate price appreciation has been very rapid
though housing credit is small in aggregate. The authorities are taking steps to strengthen
monitoring in these areas with a view to better design potential policy responses. Progress towards
implementing a positive credit bureau and the improvements to the central bank’s credit
information system are welcome. Addressing key information gaps regarding housing price
indicators, such as publishing an index based on purchases and with broad geographic coverage,
will also be helpful. Finally, it will be important to maintain close monitoring of the risk profile of
public banks, which look set to expand credit at a sizeable rate going forward. Indeed, containing
public bank credit is needed for the coherence of overall steps to manage credit growth as recovery
takes hold.
53.
Past steps taken to manage credit growth risks are welcome—a key issue going
forward will be the design and introduction of broader based measures. The authorities have
appropriately introduced various macroprudential measures to contain financial risks in specific
sectors. They have made clear that MaPs are targeted at financial stability. The staff also welcomes
the authorities’ plans to bring forward the implementation of countercyclical capital buffers

1/ Public sector net debt. It comprises federal government (central government, central bank, and social security), states, municipalities, and public enterprises.
2/ Derived as [(r - π(1+g) - g + ae(1+r)]/(1+g+π+gπ)) times previous period debt ratio, with r = interest rate; π = growth rate of GDP deflator; g = real GDP growth rate; a = share of
foreign-currency denominated debt; and e = nominal exchange rate depreciation (measured by increase in local currency value of U.S. dollar).
3/ The real interest rate contribution is derived from the denominator in footnote 2/ as r - π (1+g) and the real growth contribution as -g.
4/ The exchange rate contribution is derived from the numerator in footnote 2/ as ae(1+r).
5/ For projections, this line includes exchange rate changes.
6/ Defined as public sector deficit, plus amortization of medium and long-term public sector debt, plus short-term debt at end of previous period.
7/ The key variables include real GDP growth; real interest rate; and primary balance in percent of GDP.
8/ Derived as nominal interest expenditure divided by previous period debt stock.

1/ Shaded areas represent actual data. Individual shocks are permanent one-half standard deviation shocks. Figures
in the boxes represent average projections for the respective variables in the baseline and scenario being presented.
Ten-year historical average for the variable is also shown.
2/ For historical scenarios, the historical averages are calculated over the ten-year period, and the information is
used to project debt dynamics five years ahead.
3/ Permanent 1/4 standard deviation shocks applied to real interest rate, growth rate, and primary balance.
4/ One-time real depreciation of 30 percent and 10 percent of GDP shock to contingent liabilities occur in 2012, with
real depreciation defined as nominal depreciation (measured by percentage fall in dollar value of local currency)
minus domestic inflation (based on GDP deflator).

BRAZIL

Annex I. Brazil: The Post-Lehman Performance of Brazilian
Manufacturing1
Following its v-shaped recovery from the global financial crisis, the Brazilian
manufacturing sector has stagnated. This note finds that increases in relative unit labor
costs and nominal exchange rate appreciation are among the factors behind this sub-par
performance.
1.
Industrial production (IP) in Brazil has stagnated since late 2009. The Lehman crisis
interrupted a 5-year cycle during which the sector grew by almost 5 percent per annum on average.
In line with experience in other countries, production collapsed in the immediate aftermath of the
demand and credit shocks in the fourth quarter of 2008. However, this was followed by a sharp
bounce back with output returning to the pre-crisis level by late 2009. The very weak performance
of the sector since then has been in marked contrast to the sustained growth in demand and in the
services sector (Text Chart). Indeed, the post-crisis recovery of Brazilian IP has been at the weaker
end of emerging market peers.

This slow growth has been correlated with a stronger exchange rate and increasing
import competition. The ratio of imports to sales in the industrial sector (looking at imports and
sales for final consumption), has increased 34 percent between 2009 and 2011. A particular example
of this pattern is the case of the vehicles segment, where the import penetration rose 42 percent
while export orientation rose 12 percent. Moreover, post 2009 through its peak, the real exchange
rate appreciated some 15 percent even as the real/US$ exchange rate fully recovered to pre-crisis
levels.

Indeed, there has been a sizable increase in relative unit labor costs in Brazil during
this period. Unit labor costs (ULCs) in the Brazilian manufacturing sector, measured as the ratio of
the wage bill to the value-added of that sector, have increased nearly 20 percent when compared to
ULCs of Brazil’s main trade partners. In absolute terms, the shift in Brazil’s ULCs post-Lehman is
explained by a rise in real average wages of almost 11 percent, and an expansion on manufacturing
employment of near 5 percent that have not been matched by productivity increases. In relative
terms, ULC differentials have been higher than inflation differentials between Brazil and its main
trade partners—especially the advanced economies—implying an even stronger appreciation of the
real exchange rate post-Lehman.2

Regression analysis suggests that manufacturing performance is well explained by
demand conditions and relative prices. In a basic linear regression model, we seek to explain the
growth rate of manufacturing production (volume) as a function of a parsimonious list of indicators
of domestic and external demand, and relative prices and costs:

Rising ULCs are negatively correlated with growth in IP, highlighting the need to raise productivity in
tandem with wages and employment. The pre-Lehman appreciation of the nominal exchange rate is
positively correlated with manufacturing growth due to the wealth effect of higher commodities
prices. However, the post-Lehman exchange rate appreciation, in part reflecting strong capital
inflows, has not been associated with continued IP growth.

This analysis suggests that strengthening competitiveness in the manufacturing sector
will require fundamental measures to boost productivity. In the short term, managing cyclical

But in the medium term, structural measures to improve labor productivity and sectoral
competitiveness would be welcome. These could include steps such as improving infra-structure,
reducing shipping and electricity costs, lowering the tax burden, and increasing the supply of skilled
workers to match local manufacturing needs and global market standards. Indeed, further sustained

Annex II. Brazil: Growth and Inflation Outlook1
Pre-empting a sharper-than-anticipated slowdown in the second half of 2011, the central
bank embarked on an aggressive cycle of monetary easing. Until now, other elements of
the policy mix have provided space for lower policy rates—in particular, the government
is anticipated to adhere to its relatively tight fiscal targets. More than sufficient stimulus is
now in train to push growth back to trend by late 2012. Risks to growth and inflation are
now balanced, in part reflecting deteriorating medium term inflation expectations and
the potential for fiscal policy slippages. A pause in the easing cycle is now warranted and,
in the absence of an adverse external shock, staff’s baseline suggests that the authorities
should stand ready to unwind some monetary stimulus through 2013.
1.
The economy entered 2012 with very little momentum. Policymakers succeeded in
moderating above-trend growth in 2011, through a combination of tight fiscal and monetary
policies. Macroprudential measures, aimed at slowing credit growth, also contributed to the
moderation. But a sharper slowdown in the pace of demand growth emerged during the second half
of the year—in part reflecting adverse external spillovers—with real GDP expanding by an
annualized 0.7 percent during this period. This has resulted in a modestly negative output gap of
about ½ to 1 percent.
2.
The slowdown has yet to translate
into a material and broad easing of labor
market conditions. The unemployment rate
has continued marking record lows (since
the current survey began in 2001) and
currently stands at about 5½ percent. At the
same time, real wage growth has been
boosted by substantial increases in the
minimum wage, directly but also indirectly
through indexation. There are some pockets
of moderation, particularly related to
employment growth and hours worked in
the manufacturing sector, but conditions in
the service sector remain robust.

The partial unwinding of transitory supply shocks that boosted consumer prices in
2011 has resulted in a notable decline in inflation since the Q3 2011 peak. Inflation has fallen
by more than 2 percentage points from its high in 2011 and is now about 5 percent. Tradable
goods, including food and energy, have contributed most to this decline in headline inflation, in part
because lower and more stable commodity prices have been passed through. The periodic re1

weighting of the index accounts for about another ¼–½ percentage point fall in inflation.
Importantly, annualized service price inflation, which is very persistent in Brazil and strongly
influenced by wage growth, has remained high and has even picked up somewhat in recent months.
4.
Monetary policy has responded early and aggressively to this slowdown, with the
policy rate cut by a cumulative 400 basis points since August 2011. This response has been
largely justified by subsequent growth and inflation developments. Real interest rates now stand at
about 3½ percent, well below the average for the inflation targeting era. The current policy interest
rates is about 50‒100 basis points below the level implied by a simple Taylor Rule, although the
steady trend decline in the real interest rate—which suggests a declining natural rate of interest—is
a complicating factor in this type of assessment.2

5.
The nominal exchange rate has depreciated by almost 30 percent since August 2011,
although recent evidence suggests that pass through to inflation has weakened. The central
bank has intervened infrequently and on a modest scale since the start of 2012 with the aim of
reducing the pace and volatility of exchange rate changes. The broadening of the IOF tax may have
discouraged some capital inflows and reduced appreciation pressures. The unexpectedly rapid pace
of policy rate cuts together with evolving central bank guidance about rates staying low for an
extended period have contributed to the weaker currency. Evidence from the early stages of the
inflation targeting era suggested that exchange rate pass through to domestic consumer prices was
relatively high, but more recent studies indicate that pass through has become weaker, perhaps
reflecting improving central bank credibility since 2005, but also a declining share of tradables in the
consumption basket.
6.
Inflation expectations have deteriorated since the current easing cycle began. Surveys
now indicate that inflation is anticipated to converge to the target range at a slower pace through
the next five years. At the 2‒3 year horizon, expectations are for inflation to remain above the target
mid-range and close to its current level. The deterioration in inflation expectations has occurred
since the start of the current easing cycle and in a context of slowing economic growth. This

presents a challenge for policymakers, particularly as survey-based measures appear to be fairly
reliable predictors of inflation over various horizons over the last decade.1 In contrast, breakeven
rates from index-linked bonds with maturities of 5‒10 years have remained within their typical
trading range, although these rates do not have a good track record as predictors.2
7.
Until now, other elements of the policy mix, particularly fiscal, have provided space for
monetary easing. The government is maintaining its commitment to target a primary fiscal surplus
of 3.1 percent of GDP. However, lending by public banks has picked up, and odds are there could be
a further acceleration and reduction of lending rates. Macroprudential policies directly focused on
domestic credit have been kept largely unchanged, but changes have been made to the capital
controls regime, most recently including a progressively broader application of the IOF tax on debt
inflows.
8.
In the absence of a large adverse external shock, the substantial interest rate reduction
and robust wage gains should allow growth to recover quite strongly and the output gap to
close through 2012. Recent experience, in which shifting domestic policies have delivered
pronounced cyclicality in growth, suggests that policy multipliers in Brazil are large. Indeed, earlier
staff analysis finds evidence that the monetary policy transmission mechanism works efficiently in
Brazil, with lower policy rates passing through completely and quickly to effective lending and
deposit rates. The bank lending channel also supports the traction of monetary policy.3
9.
The risks to growth and inflation through 2013 are balanced. There is the risk of fiscal
slippages or a larger-than-anticipated transfer of resources from the government to BNDES that
could further boost overall credit growth. The main downside risk stems from adverse external
spillovers, particularly if global growth concerns trigger significant commodity price declines.
10.
Upside risks are priced in to financial markets. Investors remain somewhat skeptical of
the central bank’s claim that a single-digit policy rate over a sustained period is consistent with
inflation converging to target over a reasonable timeframe. The central bank has successfully
engineered a lower interest rate futures curve, but policy rates are still anticipated to rise between
150‒250 basis points higher over a three year horizon. A tightening cycle is priced to start in at least
by early 2013 with policy rates anticipated to rise back above 10 percent by early 2014. At the same
time, recent central bank guidance does appear to have increased market uncertainty about the

A recent Central Bank of Brazil study found that the predictive content of index-linked Treasuries was poor at all but
the shortest horizons. This may be due to structural supply and demand factors, including the relatively high demand
for long duration assets that deliver a fixed real return by domestic and foreign institutional investors with a long
investment horizon.

Monetary policy has been eased appropriately, but more caution is now justified. The
effects of policy rate cuts will take some time to feed through to the real economy, but past
experience, including 2011, suggests that the impact on growth is substantial. The prospect of lower
equilibrium real interest rates may provide some incentive to keep policy rates at historically low
levels, but the costs of misjudgment are high, including an erosion of Brazil’s hard-earned inflation
credibility at a time when inflation expectations are already elevated.

Appendix. A Small Monetary Policy Model for Brazil
The analysis in this note is informed by a small “New Keynesian” macroeconomic model with
rational expectations that has been developed and widely used in the Fund (e.g., Berg, Karam, and
Laxton, 2006). The key behavioral equations in the model consist of an output gap (including a fiscal
gap, foreign output gap and commodity prices), an inflation equation, an exchange rate equation
(including a time-varying risk premium), a monetary policy reaction function, and a fiscal policy rule.
The model is calibrated for Brazil and the monetary policy rule reflecting the reaction function of the
central bank since the start of the inflation targeting era.
The fiscal policy function is based on the rule posited by Honjo and Hunt (2006) and implies that the
primary fiscal balance is a function of last period’s output gap and the expected deviation of debt
from the target debt-to-GDP ratio in the next period. Work on the role of fiscal policy in a small
Brazil model is preliminary and at this stage the coefficient on the debt gap is set to zero and the
equilibrium fiscal balance (measured by the primary balance) is set to the current WEO baseline of
3.1 percent of GDP. This means that the current role of fiscal policy in the model is to provide a
modest counter-cyclical impulse when output is below potential.
In the model’s baseline scenario, achieving inflation convergence back to the target mid-range by
end 2013 will likely require a pause in the rate-cutting cycle. The model projects the Selic interest
rate rising modestly by early 2013.4 This would be consistent with inflation converging back to the
4½ percent mid-point by the end of 2013. Importantly, this scenario is predicated on an unchanged
fiscal stance. A scenario where policy rates are held at current levels through 2013 is consistent with
inflation rising above the top end of the target range by end-2013.

4

The first period of the projection from the model is Q4 2012. For Q2-Q3 2012, the Selic policy rate is assumed to be
held at 8½ percent.

Annex III. Brazil’s Linkages and Spillovers1
Global spillovers to Brazil are felt through two main channels: commodity prices; and
capital flows and asset prices. Spillovers from Brazil can also have large effects on the
output of its nearest neighbors, both directly but also due to its amplification of global
financial shocks.
Trade
1.
Brazil’s economy is less open than its emerging economy peers and diversification by
trading partner has remained broadly stable. Trade (imports plus exports) accounts for about
25 percent of Brazil’s GDP, less than half of the level of G-20 emerging economies and considerably
less than Latin America as a region. Diversification of Brazil’s exports by trade partner has remained
largely unchanged over the last decade, with the share of exports to the euro area steady at about
20 percent (comparable to other G-20 economies), while the share to China (about 15 percent) has
risen mainly at the expense of the United States (10 percent).
2.
The key development for trade spillovers is Brazil’s increasing concentration in
commodity exports that are highly sensitive to global economic and financial conditions.
Primary commodities now account for about 45 percent of total merchandise exports, up from just
over 25 percent a decade ago, while minimally processed secondary goods account for a further
14 percent. Brazil’s commodity structure itself has also become more concentrated, with increased
dominance of iron ore and soybean products. While some of these exports are relatively less cyclical
(e.g., food), the spot price of a basket of Brazil’s largest commodity exports exhibits a high
correlation with global activity, particularly during large upswings and downswings. In previous
cycles, commodities prices have somewhat lagged economic activity indicators. More recently, as
financial investors increase their participation in commodity markets and iron ore pricing is
increasingly set in the spot market (rather than in annual contracts), the price of Brazil’s commodity
exports have become more sensitive to the prospects for growth.

Capital Flows and Asset Prices
3.
Periods of heightened global financial stress often trigger sudden stops or even
reversals in capital flows to Brazil. During episodes of global stress, the reversal in net capital
flows has averaged about 5 percent of GDP since 1995 (in annualized terms and excluding 2008).2 In
2008, the capital flow reversal reached over 11 percent of GDP. The most stable form of financing is
FDI—which has largely funded the current account deficits that have emerged since 2008—while
portfolio debt and equity flows have typically reversed sharply during period of global financial
stress. The most notable aspect about recent global spillovers is the sizable effect on lending flows.
During 2008, the reversal in lending flows of about 8 percent of GDP was much larger than the
average of previous global shocks and the recovery has been much weaker, underscoring the
emerging key role in transmitting spillovers of the global banking system.

In a broader context, Brazil’s international investment position has improved
remarkably over recent years, largely due to declining external debt (see Annex on Brazil’s
external position). Brazil’s net liability has almost halved over the last decade, falling by
25 percentage points to reach 28 percent of GDP at the end of 2011. This is mostly explained by a
large reduction in external debt with equity-based liabilities now accounting for most of the
country’s liability, a development that allows Brazil to share risk more broadly and reduce its
vulnerability to external financial shocks.

emerging markets with open capital accounts, Brazil’s equity prices are now highly correlated to the
global equity index and are somewhat more sensitive than the emerging markets average (i.e., the
exhibit a higher beta). This effect is amplified in U.S. dollar terms by the flexible exchange rate and
the tendency for the real to depreciate as global risk aversion rises (and equity prices fall). Even
though these price changes may not be due entirely to capital flows, they nonetheless can have
important real effects. Equity prices can affect domestic confidence, incentives to invest (e.g., due to
Tobin’s Q and cost of capital considerations), and domestic wealth.

Sovereign CDS spillovers could affect
external financing conditions for Brazil’s

remain steady and high—notably to the euro

significantly, indicating that Brazil’s CDS has
recently been much more stable than those of
advanced economies experiencing severe
stress during periods of risk aversion and rising
spreads. In other words, while Brazil’s CDS
often moves in the same direction as those in
the euro area, the size of those moves is
substantially smaller.

Annex IV. The Neutral Real Interest Rate in Brazil1
Real interest rates in Brazil have declined significantly over the past decade. This note
presents some empirical analysis assessing these trends and what they may mean for
changes in neutral interest rates in Brazil.2The analysis suggests that Brazil’s real neutral
interest rate has trended down. However, uncertainty about its level remains high, in part
reflecting the mixed inflation performance during this period.
1.
Real interest rates in Brazil have declined substantially over the past decade. Real short
term interest rates (RIR) reached 17 percent during the currency and confidence crisis of 2002–2003.
Since then a strong track record of performance on macroeconomic stabilization, underpinned by
the successful inflation targeting framework and fiscal rule, has ensued. Real interest rates have
trended down in this process, reaching about 4−4½ percent currently.

Notwithstanding this
decline, RIR’s in Brazil
remain well above
international comparators.
Large emerging market
economies that adopt inflation
target regimes have
succeeded on achieving real
interest rates below
2 percent—or less than half of
Brazil’s current level (Text

(Segura-Ubiergo, 2012) shows
that this reflects, in part, the
relatively low levels of savings
in Brazil and credit market
distortions, among other factors.

As a first step to form a view on the level of the neutral RIR (NRIR), we calibrate simple
consumption-based models using basic parameters from Brazil. Using a constant relative risk
aversion utility function (CRRA), we calibrate Brazil’s NRIR for a range of parameters reflecting
consumer’s inter-temporal preferences (“beta”), relative risk aversion (“gamma”), and habit
persistence (“theta”). The solution for the consumer’s utility optimization problem yields first-order

Indeed, the Central Banks’ surveys of market analysts regarding the level of the neutral real interest rate in Brazil
show that their estimates have come down over the past two years from 6¾ percent to 5½ percent per a survey
conducted in the first quarter.

conditions that imply linear positive relationship between the NRIR and per capita GDP growth—
higher per capita GDP growth implies a higher NRIR.3 On the other hand, there is a negative
relationship between the NRIR and the coefficient of relative risk aversion. In several cross-country

Fitzgerald filters) are useful for disentangling cyclical features of the real interest rate from its secular
trend. We apply such filters to the policy rate (Selic) deflated by markets’ expected inflation (12month ahead) as well as to the Selic deflated by the mid-point of the inflation target (4½ percent).
These filtered RIR levels currently range between 4−6 percent, with the higher bound derived from
the use of the BCB’s inflation target to construct the implied real rate. The gap between current
levels of the RIR and its trend value, adding in 12-month ahead inflation expectations, is about
100 bps. (Text Chart).
5.
An approach based on the evolution of the average yield curve slope also shows a
downward trend of the implied NRIR in Brazil. In well-anchored inflation targeting regimes, the
slope of the yield curve reflects mostly the term premium. Moreover, when computed over a
sufficiently long horizon and between cyclically-equivalent end-points, the average term premium
can be considered neutral with respect to the business cycle (see Basdevant et al, 2004). Yields on
Brazil’s long-term financial instruments have generally declined in tandem with yields on short-term
instruments. As such, the average term premium in Brazil since 2006 has been around 100 basis
points, while the term premium stood at 165 basis points by end-March 2012 (Text Chart below left).
In this framework, a proxy for the NRIR can be backed out by adding the excess term premium (i.e.
the actual term premium less its historical average, or 65 basis points as of end-March) to the real
short-term interest rate (3½ percent as of end-March). This approach, suggests that the NRIR is
currently at about 4 percent.

State space models also show a trend decline in RIR’s in Brazil. In such models, the
neutral real interest can be interpreted as the unobservable common factor in the short- and longterm rates after controlling for inflation expectations and other cyclical componets of the yield curve
(see Laubach and Williams, 2003). Using data up to end-March, these models suggest an NRIR of
around 4¾ percent, with a ±75 basis points confidence interval (Text Chart above right). These
estimates are consistent with most of the other methods presented above.
7.
The analysis arising from these methods is however subject to important caveats. A
common assumption in inferring the unobserved NRIR from the observed RIR is that inflation is

Annex V. Budget Rigidities in Brazil1
1.
Budget rigidities appear to be behind the rapid increase of government spending in
Brazil. Since 2005, real primary spending has increased 7 percent on average—mostly on current
spending—surpassing GDP growth (Figure 1, Panel a). As a result, Brazil has now one of the highest
spending-to-GDP ratios among emerging markets (Figure 1 panel b). Budget rigidities in the form of
revenue earmarking and mandatory allocations account for 90 percent of this spending2:


Revenue earmarking. Revenues from all sources are to some extent earmarked with the main
focus being on social sectors (education, health care, housing, and social benefits). In particular,
the Constitution establishes that at least 25 percent of tax revenue at all levels of governments
be allocated to education, and 12 and 15 percent of the states’ and municipalities’ tax revenues
are earmarked to the provision of health care services (OECD, 2011). To increase flexibility, an
arrangement for withholding federal earmarked revenues (Desvinculação das Receitas da União,
DRU) has been extended until 2015. Accordingly, 20 per cent of federal revenues (net of
intergovernmental transfers), are withheld by the federal government, thereby reducing the
extent of earmarking.



Mandatory spending. The Brazilian Constitution guarantees the funding of three types of
government expenditure: revenue sharing with states and municipalities; salaries and pension
for government employees, and interest on and repayment of the public debt. At the same time,
social security spending is mandated with pressures mounting as a result of the indexation of
minimum pensions to the minimum wage. In addition, Congress has in recent years designated
several other expenditure programs as “mandatory” in the Budget Guidance Law in order to
protect them from cuts in the presidential budget implementation decrees. Thus, mandatory
spending (at the federal level) now accounts for ¾ of total spending (Figure 1, Panel d).

2.
These rigidities introduce important distortions in fiscal management and reduce the
space for investment. First, rigidities discourage efficiency gains by perpetuating budget allocations
on the basis of historical spending and leave limited space for reallocation in response to changing
needs. This is illustrated by Brazil’s difficulty in increasing public investment which, at 2½ percent of
GDP, is less than half the average of other emerging markets. Second, these rigidities affect the
quality of fiscal adjustment with retrenchment in spending falling just on a subset of budget items.
For example, a large part of the slowdown in primary spending in 2011 came on the back of
discretionary spending which decreased ¾ percent in real terms at the federal level. Finally, budget
rigidities have contributed to procyclical spending with revenue windfalls being spent as a result of
earmarking. This trend in spending, however, might be difficult to reverse in case of an economic
slowdown.

Without significant reform, spending priorities may be difficult to implement in the
future. For illustrative purposes, we simulate the central government’s spending path over the next

2.9 percent in real terms per annum
compared to average growth rates of 8.1 percent over the last decade. This means that discretionary
spending in percent of GDP would have to decline by 0.5 percentage points. As 60 percent of
discretionary spending is related to social programs that are priority for the government (for
example, Minha casa, Minha Vida), this leaves little room for public investment. For example, if
current discretionary spending was to remain constant in percent of GDP during 2012−17, capital
spending would have to decline by 1.7 percent in real terms.
4.
Reducing budgetary rigidities will therefore be key for freeing up space for other
priority spending, including investment. Options here could include:


Rationalization of mandatory spending and revenue flexibilization in combination with more
effective medium-term planning and rolling multi-year budget plans. A possibility would be to
introduce a mechanism to de-earmark the marginal tax gains stemming from nominal output
growth—i.e. stabilize earmarks at their current nominal levels. Increasing the rate of the DRU, on
the other hand, is unlikely to yield much in the near term as most of the revenues de-earmarked
by the DRU finance mandatory expenditures anyway. Once earmarking has been reduced, it
would also be possible to consider introducing expenditure growth ceilings, as has been the
case in many other countries (for example in Sweden where the government proposes a ceiling
for central government and old-age pension expenditures for the next three years). In fact, the
government is already considering a 2.5 percent per year ceiling for the increase in real terms of

Brazil’s fiscal revenues have risen steadily during the last decade. However, given the already high revenue-to-GDP
ratio in comparison with other emerging markets, we assume there is no further increase in the tax burden.

Law 12.382 (2011) established that the minimum wage over the period 2012−2015 would be adjusted by the sum
of the average real GDP growth over the latest two years and most recent year-on-year CPI inflation. For the purpose
of this simulation, we assume the rule applies throughout 2017.

payrolls and charges in the federal sector. Finally, an additional important option would be
delinking pension growth from the minimum wage as this adds to the existing downward
rigidities in public spending and contributes to the projected rapid rise in pension outlays.


Strengthening the costing, monitoring, and evaluation of public spending with a view to increasing
its efficiency. An option would be to develop a system of “pilot evaluation programs” to assess
the efficiency of public expenditures in particular projects/programs. This would help determine
whether programs in key sectors (especially health and education) are in line with their intended
objectives and whether modifications are needed to improve results and cost-effectiveness.

Annex VI. Brazil’s External Sector Assessment1
The staff assess that Brazil’s current account deficit is somewhat below a range of
estimates for its medium-term norm and the exchange rate is somewhat above levels
that can be explained by underlying fundamentals and appropriate policy settings.
Further efforts to increase savings and investment would help address these imbalances.
Options include continuing with pension reform and shifting the structure of public
spending away from consumption towards investment. It will be important to maintain a
macro policy mix that moderates demand and facilitates rebalancing. Capital flow
management measures (CFMs) can be used in the transition to help manage volatile
capital flows.
Current Account
1.
Despite large terms of trade gains Brazil’s current account has swung into deficit over
the last years (Panel 1). Strong domestic demand and the appreciating exchange rate have
supported rapid growth in import volumes—which more than doubled since 2004—while export
volumes have remained broadly flat. Booming commodity prices have helped containing the current
account deficit. As an illustration of the impact of commodity prices, were the terms of trade to
return to their 2005 level Brazil’s current account deficit would have reached 4½ percent of GDP in
2011 (compared with the actual 2.1 percent of GDP).
2.
The observed worsening of the current account balance largely reflects a pick-up in the
investment-to-GDP ratio, while the saving rate has remained low. The challenge to Brazil’s
external sector outlook—from a saving-investment perspective—is that both private and public
savings are relatively low compared with other emerging economies. Increasing domestic saving
would help preventing further deterioration in external balances over the medium term. Policy
measures that could help here include supporting private savings through further steps to reform
the pension system and slow the rate of growth of public consumption, and capital market reforms,
among others.
3.
With unchanged policies, and at the current level of the real exchange rate, the current
account deficit is expected to widen further over the medium term to over 3 percent of GDP.
This outlook is predicated on continued buoyant growth in imports and––consistent with the
medium term outlook underlying the current World Economic Outlook––some gradual worsening in
the terms of trade, and moderating external demand for Brazilian exports. The on-going
development of Brazil’s off-shore (“pre-sal”) oil potential, however, introduces a considerable
uncertainty to these projections.2 Based on the staff’s current estimates, the oil balance—oil exports

This is related to uncertainty over the potential size of Brazil’s oil reserves, the timing for the start of production in

net of direct oil imports and imports of capital goods related to the oil sector—is expected to
improve by one percentage point of GDP from 2011 to 2017. By 2020, net oil exports are projected
to increase to almost 3 million barrels per day, and all else equal, would reduce the current account
deficit further by an additional one percentage point of GDP. These developments—if not offset by
higher imports—would tend towards helping close the estimated current account and exchange
rate gaps (see section C) in the long run.
Exchange rate and relative prices
4.
The real exchange rate appreciated over the last decade, though there has been some
reversal in recent months. It rose by almost 90 percent between 2004 and mid-2011, but has since
depreciated by about 12 percent through May 2012 (Panel 2). However, the real effective exchange
rate (REER) remains above long-term average levels (e.g. as of end-May 2012, it was about
20 percent above its 10-year average). Most of the movements in the REER were due to nominal
exchange rate changes. Over the last years two factors have played a key role in driving exchange
rate strength: terms of trade gains and strong capital flows. Brazil’s terms of trade have increased
about 30 percent since 2004, although there has been some reversal since late 2011, reflecting the
decline in some commodity prices. Meanwhile overall capital flows averaged about 4 percent of GDP
during 2009‒11, although there has been a shift in composition away from portfolio to foreign
direct investment flows.
5.
The price level in Brazil is considerably higher than in other countries with a similar
level of development. In 2011, the PPP-adjusted prices of Brazilian goods—the relative cost in
dollars of equivalent consumption baskets in Brazil and the United States (Panel 2, lower left
chart)—exceeded unity, implying that similar goods are more expensive in Brazil than in the U.S.
Indeed, going forward, given expected inflation differentials and assuming a constant nominal
exchange rate, the price level in Brazil prices would further diverge from the range that could be
expected in an economy with a similar level of development.3
Model based current account and exchange rate valuations
6.
Model based estimates also suggest that the current account deficit is somewhat above
its medium-term norm and that the real exchange rate is on the strong side. The staff’s analysis
suggests that a structural current account deficit of about 1 percent of GDP over the medium term
and real exchange rate depreciation of about 5‒15 percent would be consistent with fundamentals
and desirable policy settings.


The IMF’s new External Balance Approach (both adjusted and unadjusted for policy gaps) as well
as the traditional CGER approach, suggest norms for the medium term current account deficit in
Brazil of between ½ to 1½ percent of GDP. These estimates are presented in the attached table.

This exercise assumes that the cross-section of international PPP prices in 2005–09 represents “equilibrium” price
levels that remain stable over time.

However, it is critical to note that they could understate norms given upside uncertainty on oil
production and export prospects.


The estimates for real exchange rate misalignment are similar across the EBA RER and CGER
approaches, indicating an overvaluation in the 13 to 20 percent range relative to current and
medium term fundamentals. However, the recent depreciation of the real exchange rate relative
to the reference assessment period would reduce the estimated misalignment by about
7 percent.

1/ For REER, positive values indicate overvaluation. The estimated gaps are adjusted to impose a multilateral consistency.
2/ The first number for CA Norm (CA regression) is reported for unchanged policies, and the number in parenthesis is for desired policies,
both gaps are relative to the cyclically adjusted value. If the policy gaps are closed in Brazil and its trading partners, the current account gap
would decline and the current account norm widen as the scope of policy improvement is larger for trading partners. The exchange rate gap
(RER regression) corresponds to a difference between the actual level of RER and RER under recommended policies.
3/ The macroeconomic balance (MB) approach calculates the difference between the medium term CA balance and an estimated equilibrium
CA "norm". The latter is a function of various fundamentals (fiscal balance, old-age dependency ratio, NFA, oil balance, real GDP per capita,
and real GDP growth). The ERER is estimated as a function of medium-term fundamentals (NFA, relative productivity differentials, the terms
of trade, and trade restrictions). The ES approach calculates the difference between the actual CA balance and the NFA-stabilizing CA
balance. The real exchange rate adjustment is calculated to bring the current account balance in line with its NFA-stabilizing level.
4/ Reflects the change in the real exchange rate from its average-2011 level to May 2012.

Capital account flows, international reserves and international investment position
7.
In recent years Brazil has attracted sizable capital inflows that have helped to finance
the current account deficit and contributed to the exchange rate appreciation (Panel 3). The
bulk of capital flows have comprised FDI which have more than financed the widening current
account deficit. Net portfolio flows have been more volatile, increasing markedly following the
global crisis, especially during 2010‒11Q1, but tapering off since then. Brazil has offered
international investors large differentials in terms of growth prospects and interest rates that have
attracted substantial flows in a context of extraordinarily easy monetary policy in the advanced
economies. These flows had added to appreciation pressure on the real in the current global cycle.

8.
The full range of policy tools has been deployed to manage large capital flows
pressures. Since 2010, CFMs have been applied to moderate flows and influence their composition.
While these measures have been effective in slowing the pace of cyclical flows, their effects tend to
attenuate through time and periodic adjustments have been necessary. Portfolio flows moderated in
2011, responding to CFMs and global market conditions, but external borrowing picked up, surging
in early 2012 on back of low global rates. In response to this, further adjustments were made to the
CFM framework to provide disincentives for short-term borrowing flows (by raising the duration
limit on foreign borrowing to be exempt from the IOF from 2 to 5 years). More broadly, the CFM
framework has appropriately been managed in a counter-cyclical manner. For example, when capital
flow pressures have diminished, the framework has been eased.
9.
Central bank intervention has focused on seeking to reduce the pace and volatility of
exchange rate changes. With the moderation of external inflows, the pace of accumulation of
external reserves has slowed down since mid-2011. International reserves have stabilized around
US$370 billion, levels which are more than adequate with respect to various metrics, including the
IMF’s composite adequacy measure. As such, Brazil is well placed to withstand various external
shocks, though further reserve accumulation may take place in the context of managing cyclical
capital flows.
10.
Brazil’s net foreign asset (NFA) position and its composition have improved. The NFA
position has improved from -45 percent of GDP in 2003 to -20 percent of GDP in 2011. FDI liabilities
account for more than one-third of total liabilities. Moreover, Brazil’s NFA position and external debt
levels are relatively low compared with other emerging market economies. However, with the
projected widening in the current account deficit in the baseline at unchanged real exchange rates,
the NFA position would worsen over the medium. Nonetheless, the composition of financing in such
a circumstance would be expected to remain mainly FDI with external debt rising only slightly from
13 percent of GDP in 2011 to 15 percent of GDP by 2017. In the longer run, as Brazil’s large pre-sal
oil reserves come on line, added efforts to increase savings and therefore strengthen the country’s
external NFA position would be appropriate.

Annex VII. Brazil Credit Boom and Risks1

2.
Brazil’s credit growth has been very
strong but the gap with respect to trend has
narrowed. Credit to GDP in Brazil stands at
about 50 percent of GDP, compared to about
25 percent in 2002. Despite this strong trend, the
growth of credit relative to GDP moderated
during the past years shrinking the credit-to-GDP
gap that had emerged during 2008−09. The
overall level of credit-to-GDP ratio remains
relatively low by international standards.
3.
International experience points out that
credit booms may end in busts.2 Expanding too
fast may lead to vulnerabilities through looser
lending standards, excessive leverage, and asset
price bubbles. Dell’Ariccia et al (2012) find that
about one in three booms has been followed by a
period of sub-par growth or a banking crisis. While
recognizing that unhealthy booms are difficult to
separate from healthy ones, these authors identify
that duration, size and financial deepening are the
key determinants to help tell in advance if a credit

1.
Brazil has experienced a decade of
buoyant credit growth. Credit in Brazil as well
as in other countries in the Latin America
region, has been growing very rapidly during
the last years. In all these countries, a structural
transformation has helped raise the supply and
demand of credit. Capital inflows and the
development of the domestic capital market,
have also supported lending expansion.
Economic stability, associated with a better
business environment, strengthened labor
markets and social mobility, has raised the
demand for credit by corporates and consumers.

boom would end up badly. Larger and persistent booms, as well as those that start at a high creditto-GDP ratio, are more likely to pose financial stability risks.
4.
The FSAP notes that credit risks in Brazil are well contained. The bulk of the credit
expansion in Brazil, from a relatively low level of GDP (credit to GDP stood at about 20 percent in
2004) likely reflects financial deepening as noted in ¶1. For this reason, monitoring and policy
intervention targeted to sectors experiencing excessive credit growth have been the preferred
approaches followed by the Brazilian authorities. For example, in December 2010, the authorities
tightened macroprudential measures in specific consumer lending products, and starting in January
2012 the central bank credit risk information system has started to register additional information to
better monitor credit developments and associated risks.
5.
All credit categories have experienced strong growth rates in Brazil but especially so
consumer credit. Consumer credit now represents 46 percent of total credit (compared to
43 percent in 2005 and 23 percent in 2002). Consumer credit, albeit decelerating slightly during
2011, with an annual growth rate of 20.7 percent compared to 22.4 percent during 2010, continues
to expand at a strong rates and thus, it is creating a source of vulnerability for the household sector.

The consumer credit boom has led to an accumulation of consumer debt and high debt
service ratios. Consumer indebtedness (as a percentage of disposable income) currently exceeds
40 percent of income. This is in line

175 percent for overdrafts; rates on
housing credit—the bulk of which is directed credit—on the other hand, range between
4−12 percent). Mortgages are a small share of the consumer portfolio (about 20 percent), compared
to more than 60 percent in regional peers.
7.
Data limitations constrain the analysis of household credit risk, but the last survey
available (2008) shows some concentration of debt service burden already at the low-income
end. Indeed, while aggregate data on household leverage is available, the authorities have just
launched an effort this year to collect more detailed information on household credit risk, including
levels of leverage across income groups. However, some information on household’s exposure to

credit risk is available from the existing
household survey data which provides detailed
information on the type of borrowing, and
importantly the level of debt service costs and
income, though not the level of debt for
individual households. The 2008–09
Household Budget Survey (Pesquisa de
Orçamentos Familiares) shows that households
with debt service commitments above 20
percent of income had a high concentration in
the low and middle income percentiles.

Recent credit trends suggest that the financial situation of at least some households
has continued to deteriorate. Data from the existing credit registry (Sistema de Informações de
Crédito) show that during 2010−11, the number of new individuals borrowing from the banking
sector increased, although this increase decelerated in 2011. Data from Serasa Experian on credit
report requests show that during 2010, demand for credit by low-income households increased
significantly. At the same time, the composition of credit has shifted towards more expensive
products. As the central bank tightened macroprudential measures in specific lending products (car
loans, credit cards, long-term consumer loans) in late 2010 (as noted above), the use of two
expensive lending products—credit cards and overdraft accounts—surged. At the same time,
delinquency rates have increased. By early 2012, the non-performing loans to loan ratio for
unearmarked consumer credit has reached 7.6 percent (up by 1.9 since December 2010). The surge
in non-performing loan rates is particularly sharp for loans for durables, overdraft accounts, and
credit cards. There are also other indications of increased household stress: (i) bounced checks
picked up, and (ii) deliquency rates by origination of the loans increased in particular for vehicle
loans.

Safeguards Assessments: A safeguards assessment of the Banco Central do Brasil (BCB) was
completed in June 2002 and updated in March 2005.
Exchange Rate Arrangement: Since January 18, 1999, Brazil’s foreign exchange regime has been an
independent float. Brazil continued to avail itself of the transitional arrangements of Article XIV,
Section 2, of the Fund’s Articles of Agreement through November 1999, while no longer maintaining
restrictions under this Article. In a letter dated November 11, 1999, the Brazilian authorities informed
the Fund that they accepted the obligations of Article VIII, Sections 2(a), 3, and 4, effective
November 30, 1999.
Foreign exchange regulations have been liberalized further in recent years. In March 2005, the
foreign exchange markets were unified; the requirement that residents transferring foreign
exchange abroad do so through CC5 accounts (nonresident financial institutions accounts) was
eliminated and export surrender requirements were simplified; limits and restrictions for the
purchase and sale of foreign exchange and for international transfers in reais were eliminated for
most transactions, except for: (a) investments in the capital and derivatives markets; and
(b) investments abroad made by institutions authorized to operate by the central bank and for all
funds subject to specific regulations. At present, central bank prior approval is no longer required
for virtually all transactions.
In August 2006, remaining foreign currency controls at the central bank on export proceeds and
import payments were abolished. The surrender of foreign exchange for exports was increased to
the last working day of the corresponding month in the year following the date of shipment (and
360 days before shipment), and exporters were allowed to permanently keep up to 30 percent of
their export proceeds abroad. Other measures introduced in August 2006 included: (a) the
elimination of fines for delays or lack of execution of foreign exchange contracts for operations up
to US$3,000; (b) the possibility of registering in domestic currency (at the central bank) all foreign
capital held by corporations in Brazil and not yet registered or subject to other forms of registration;
and (c) the possibility of making payments in reais for duty-free store purchases.
In September 2006, restrictions for investments in the capital and derivatives markets were
eliminated. In April 2007, regulations on investments abroad by investment funds were liberalized
further, subject to prudential rules set by the Securities and Exchange Commission of Brazil. In
March 2008, exporters were allowed to keep 100 percent of their export proceeds abroad, up from

the 30 percent limit established in August 2006. In May 2008, banks were authorized to hold
accounts offshore in reais. In July 2008 changes were made (a) allowing firms not registered to act in
foreign exchange markets to make transactions of up to US$3,000 without prior authorization;
(b) permitting settlement in reais of foreign exchange transactions between authorized Brazilian
banks and foreign banks; and (c) raising to US$50,000 the limit on financial and trade transactions
not subject to registration requirements for nonbank financial institutions. In November 2008
authorized banks were permitted to use accounts in entities domiciled offshore to settle realdenominated obligations with nonresident accounts.
Last Article IV Consultation
The last Article IV consultation with Brazil was concluded by the Executive Board on July 20, 2011.
Brazil is on the 12-month cycle. Joint Fund/World Bank missions visited Brazil in 2002 for the
Financial Sector Assessment Program (FSAP), which was discussed by the Board in December 2002.
A FSAP Update mission took place in March 2012.
Technical Assistance
Fiscal Affairs Department (FAD). In September 2001, an FAD mission conducted a fiscal ROSC, and
in December 2001 a mission provided Technical Assistance (TA) on tax reform. Subsequent missions
have discussed the scope for increasing investment in infrastructure within a framework of
continued fiscal responsibility, including during a follow-up visit in November 2004. In July 2008, a
ROSC on fiscal transparency was undertaken for the state of São Paulo, which also received a
seminar on performance budgeting in November 2008. In December 2009 a mission visited São
Paulo to examine the state’s medium-term expenditure framework with the purpose of improving
fiscal performance and the quality of public expenditure. In November 2010, a short-term expert
visited Sao Paulo to provide advice on cost accounting and a long-term advisor was installed in
February 2011 to support efforts in this area. In April a follow-up mission evaluated progress in
implementing the program budgeting and cost accounting systems. In May 2011, a short-term
expert followed-up on the implementation of the program budgeting reforms. Between July 2011
and May 2012, FAD conducted several missions on public financial management, focusing on the
review of the cost accounting systems and on improvements to the budgeting system.
Statistics Department (STA). Several missions have visited Brazil during 1998–2011 to provide TA
on monetary and financial statistics, quarterly national income accounts, and government finance.
These missions also assisted the authorities in the subscription to the SDDS, improving the analytical
quality of Brazil’s monetary aggregates, and the implementation of GFSM 2001. Recent missions
have assisted the Ministry of Finance, the Banco Central do Brasil and the Instituto Brasileiro de
Geografia e Estatística with the compilation of government finance statistics, price indices and the
new national accounts framework, with greater emphasis on the consistency across macroeconomic
statistics.
Monetary and Capital Markets Department (MCM). Missions visited Brazil in 2000 to assess
observance of the Code of Good Practices on Transparency in Monetary and Financial Policies and

compliance with the Basel Core Principles for Effective Banking Supervision. In August and
December 2009, missions visited to assist the capital markets regulator (CVM) in considering mutual
funds development and regulation, and issues surrounding securitization and valuation of financial
securities. A mission visited in August 2009 to work on credit risk modeling for financial oversight. In
March 2010 a mission visited the National Treasury to initiate a technical cooperation project on
term-structure modeling and debt management. A follow up mission to present preliminary results
took place in January 2011. The project was completed in May 2011 with the publication of an IMF
working paper (WP/11/113), “On Brazil’s Term Structure: Stylized Facts and Analysis of
Macroeconomic Interactions”.
Resident Representative
The Fund maintains a resident representative office in Brasilia. The Resident Representative is
Mr. Carlos Fernandez Valdovinos, who assumed the post in July 2011.

ANNEX II. RELATIONS WITH THE WORLD BANK1
On November 1, 2011, the World Bank approved its new Country Partnership Strategy (CPS)
for Brazil, which will guide the Group’s overall program in the country for FY 2012–2015. The
new CPS builds on, and deepens, the last FY 2008‒2011 Country Strategy. The World Bank Group
has been a valued partner for Brazil, providing integrated and often multi-sector development
solutions tailored to its needs. The GoB’s demand for a continued strong partnership with the WBG
is evidenced by the pre-payment of IBRD loans, in an approximate amount of $6.7 billion between
2009 and 2011, so as to open space for sub-national lending within IBRD’s Single Borrower Limit.
The Bank has also benefited greatly from Brazil’s unique demands, which required the WBG to adapt
and learn. Innovation and knowledge have been the central elements of this relationship, with
strong flows of knowledge transfers to, from, and within Brazil, supported by a large impact
evaluation program. The FY 12–15 CPS seeks to take these achievements further by maintaining the
focus on knowledge generation and transfer, with greater emphasis on inclusiveness in line with
President Rousseff’s goal of eradicating extreme poverty. In this context, the Bank and IFC will
expand their support for the Northeast, Brazil’s poorest region, and for sustainable development in
the Amazon, the Cerrado, and other fragile ecosystems.
Brazil’s priorities for its partnership with the WBG are focused on second-generation
development problems that require innovative solutions. These involve improvements in
national policy frameworks and new ways to implement programs with sub-national governments
and at the firm level. The WBG will help address these challenges, and help achieve the overarching
goal of higher rates of inclusive and sustainable growth by focusing on four strategic objectives:
(i) increase the efficiency of public and private investments; (ii) improve the quality and expand the
provision of public services for low income households; (iii) promote regional economic
development through improved policies, strategic infrastructure investments, and support for the
private sector in frontier areas; and (iv) further improve sustainable natural resource management
and enhance climatic resilience while contributing to local economic development and helping to
meet rising global food demand. Brazil is looking to the Bank as a partner in the dissemination of
the country knowledge and development experiences to other countries.
At the Federal level, Brazil’s demand is concentrated in knowledge and strategy development
services. These require a combination of AAA and knowledge-intensive lending, but also leaving
room for other financial solutions as needed. The Federal Government is also interested in the
Bank’s support to sub-national Governments as a way of enhancing the implementation of national
policies, ranging from the fiscal responsibility framework to strategic social and infrastructure
investment programs. Sub-national governments demand integrated multi-sector development
solutions, combining technical and financial support and using tailored instruments. The private

sector seeks highly customized financing packages to help meet unique business and growth
objectives.
The CPS identifies an indicative IBRD lending program in the order of US$5.8 billion for
FY 12–13. While this is in line with annual lending in FY 08–11, it is equivalent to about 0.3% of total
public expenditures. IFC's own-account investment program is forecast at about US$1.0 billion
annually in FY 12–13, a minute fraction of total private sector investment. Thus, if the WBG is to have
a significant impact in Brazil, this cannot be derived exclusively from the size of its financial
contributions, which are bound to be small with respect to the country’s own resources. Rather, the
WBG will seek to have a development impact in Brazil through the knowledge contributions that it
will embed in its various activities. In particular, the Bank Group will deploy its resources according
to the following principles. Flexibility: Adjusting areas of engagement and instruments to better
respond to the country’s evolving needs. Selectivity: Focusing on areas where Brazil faces secondgeneration development challenges and can benefit most from the Group’s knowledge and
experience. Innovation: Supporting innovative investments and policy reforms that can be replicated
locally and internationally, and offering innovative services and instruments (e.g. result-based and
multi-sector loans, partial credit risk and other guarantees). Leveraging: Increasing the use of
leveraged resources from government, the private sector and other development partners, to
maximize development impacts.
IFC will continue responding to the needs of a rapidly-evolving private sector with a suite of
competitive financial and advisory products. In FY 11, Brazil had IFC’s largest single country new
business and mobilization program in the world. While IFC does not expect to increase business
volumes significantly, the nature of its involvement is changing toward (i) a greater focus on smaller,
more difficult investments in poorer, frontier regions such as the Northeast and North;
(ii) supporting innovation and competitiveness, promoting South-South knowledge transfers and
encouraging access to new markets and products, and (iii) increasing IFC's advisory support to subnational Governments for PPPs in infrastructure, social sectors, and the environment. IFC sharply
expanded its activities in Brazil during the previous CPS period. As of May 31st, 2012, IFC
commitments in Brazil stand at $3.75 billion.

ANNEX III. RELATIONS WITH THE INTER-AMERICAN
DEVELOPMENT BANK1
The IDB’s New Country Strategy with Brazil was approved on May 9th, 2012. This was established for
the period 2012−2014 and is comprised of six strategic objectives: (1) stimulate social and
productive inclusion; (2) improve the condition of the country’s infrastructure (3) promote the
development of sustainable cities; (4) improve the institutional capacity of public entities;
(5) increase the sustainable management of natural resources and climate change mitigation and
adaptation actions; and (6) promote development through the private sector.
For 2012, total loan approvals are estimated to reach US$2,185.7 million. Loans with sovereign
guarantee make the bulk of the operations amounting to US$1,985.7 million, while operations with
the private sector are expected to total US$200 million.2 In addition, the IDB program in the period
estimates approvals of US$11.1 million in grants for Technical Cooperation. The new country
strategy resumed the trend of increasing share of subnational and private sector operations in the
total IDB financing in Brazil.
In 2011, the IDB approved 14 loans amounting to US$2,186 million, including 5 operations for
US$67.7 million for the private sector. Most of the lending went to support productivity and
infrastructure (63.8 %) and improving the living conditions in the cities (34.2%) and 88% of the
volume borrowed by Brazil in 2011 went to subnational governments (although, all of them with
sovereign guarantee). Among the major operations approved, some highlights are: (a) Mario Covas
Rodoanel Project US$1,148.6 million), (b) Environmental Sanitation Programs for Guanabara Bay
Area and Igarapes in Manaus (US$732 million),(c) Rehabilitation for the Furnas and Luiz Carlos
Hydroelectric Power Plants (US$128.6 million) and (d) Profisco Credit Facility (US$5.6 million to State
of Sergipe).

ANNEX IV. STATISTICAL ISSUES
The quality of macroeconomic statistics has improved significantly, and the statistical information
provided to the Fund is adequate for surveillance. A mission to prepare the data module of the
ROSC took place in early 2005 and recommended the adoption of the Government Finance Statistics
Manual 2001 (GFSM 2001). Brazil subscribes to the Special Data Dissemination Standard (SDDS).
National accounts
In March 2007, the Brazilian Statistical Institute (IBGE) released revised national accounts for
1995‒2006. The revised data are benchmarked in 2000 and introduced significant improvements in
methodology, including the use of annual sectoral surveys and of corporate income tax collection
data. Also, the revised data reflects enhanced coverage of economic activities (e.g. formal,
unobserved activities), use of direct estimates of the various components of aggregate demand and
economic activities (e.g. private and public consumption, gross capital formation, and mobile
telephone services), as well as other significant improvements in methodology, including annual and
quarterly supply and demand tables for about 300 products of relevance for the economy. National
accounts are now compiled in accordance with the System of National Accounts 1993, and the series
through 2008 (data and supporting methodological notes) are available on the internet
(http://www.ibge.gov.br) and in International Financial Statistics (IFS).
The IBGE has also improved the compilation of quarterly national accounts, and currently compiles
quarterly supply and demand tables from an array of critical products for the economy. Further
methodological improvements should include the compilation of regular surveys on services and
construction activities that would help cross check current sectoral estimates based on sectoral
employment and use of inputs (e.g., cement, soil, ferrous metals).
Prices
Since July 1999, the official consumer price index has been the Broad Consumer Price Index (IPCA)
compiled by the IBGE. The IPCA covers changes in the prices of goods and services purchased by
households earning between one and forty times the minimum wage in 11 metropolitan areas. The
IBGE, the private Getúlio Vargas Foundation (FGV), and the University of São Paulo prepare other
consumer price indices with different geographic and demographic coverage. Wholesale price
indices are compiled only by the FGV. Wholesale and consumer price indices are reported regularly
in IFS. The export price data published in IFS are total unit values of exports, and unit values and
wholesale prices of coffee exports. The IBGE is moving toward compiling a producer price index for
release in 2010, with technical assistance from the Fund.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND 13

BRAZIL

Government finance
The Ministry of Finance and the Central Bank of Brazil compile and disseminate government finance
statistics using the Government Finance Statistics Manual 2001 presentation. The reported statistics
include the statement of government operations and financial balance sheet for the consolidated
Central Government (comprising the National Treasury and Social Security) as well as the financing
operations and the financial balance sheet for General Government.
The reported data were compiled by converting the nationally published data, which still broadly
follow the GFSM 1986 framework to the GFSM 2001 classifications. The data reflect the movements
of the single treasury account and are on a cash basis. The only exception is interest, which
incorporates the accrual based information compiled by the Central Bank of Brazil. The Gross Debt
indicator disseminated by the authorities excludes the government securities under the Central
Bank’s outright ownership, making international comparisons difficult.
In 2009, the Brazilian authorities have engaged in a migration plan for the full implementation the
GFSM 2001. This plan comprises the introduction of a new accounting framework based on the
International Public Sector Accounting Standards (IPSAS), which merges the traditional budgetary
approach, the accrual based accounting as well as some additional internal controls into a single
system. This new accounting framework significantly enhances the usefulness of the Brazilian public
sector accounting information and will be a significant step towards the compilation of complete
GFS in a systematic way, expected to be in place by 2013.
Monetary and financial sector
The Brazilian Central Bank (BCB) compiles and publishes monetary and financial statistics, with
concepts, definitions, and classification that are broadly in line with the Monetary and Financial
Statistics Manual (MFSM). In April 2008, an STA mission assisted the BCB to include the closed
pension funds, representing around 50 percent of the total assets of the other financial
corporations, in the institutional coverage of monetary statistics. STA is working with the BCB in the
introduction of the standardized report forms based on accounting data and compilation of a
financial corporations survey with full institutional coverage.
The BCB regularly reports quarterly FSIs to the IMF for publication. Currently, the BCB reports all
core and 17 encouraged FSIs, with data beginning in Q1 2005. Plans are under way to compile the
rest of the encouraged FSIs.
Balance of payments
External data are compiled according to the fifth edition of the Balance of Payments Manual. The
BCB is supplementing the registry of the foreign exchange system with surveys on transportation,
insurance, and other services. Compilation of reinvested earnings and undistributed branch profits
item in the current account and reinvested earnings item in the financial account could be improved,
as the registry of the foreign exchange system does not capture these transactions. Brazil
disseminates quarterly data on the international investment position. Quarterly balance of payments

data are reported regularly for publication in IFS, and the BCB publishes data for monthly balance of
payments and the Data Template on International Reserves and Foreign Currency Liquidity with a
lag of one month. Brazil reports quarterly total external debt position data with a three-month lag to
the World Bank’s Quarterly External Debt Statistics (QEDS) database.

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2012 Article IV Consultation with Brazil
On July 9, 2012, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded the
Article IV consultation with Brazil.1
Background
The past decade has seen a remarkable social transformation in Brazil, underpinned by
macroeconomic stability and rising living standards. A strong policy framework (fiscal
responsibility, inflation targeting and a flexible exchange rate), and improved income distribution
and social outcomes have been important accomplishments. Together with terms of trade gains
and economic and financial inclusion, this has supported sizable gains in private consumption
and some increase in investment. Financial stability has been underpinned by a strong banking
system and framework for regulation and supervision.
More recently, Brazil’s economy has slowed and growth surprised on the downside last year. A
policy tightening cycle was appropriately launched during 2010-11 to cool overheating
pressures and bring inflation gradually back to target. Macroprudential measures were also
introduced to reduce stability risks in specific sectors. Growth stalled in 2011 Q3 and slowed to
2.7 percent in 2011, in part reflecting the impact of external shocks.

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On
return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the
Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the
Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the
country's authorities. An explanation of any qualifiers used in summings up can be found here:

Monetary policy has since been eased substantially though its effect on the real economy has
taken hold more gradually than in previous cycles, while the primary surplus target for 2012 has
been kept unchanged at 3.1 percent of GDP. The economy expanded only slowly in early 2012,
reflecting weak investment and business confidence and slowing trade volumes. Industrial
output remains sluggish. However, consumption has been recovering since late 2011 on the
back of improving confidence and buoyant labor market conditions, including the large minimum
wage increase.
Inflation is falling but medium term expectations have risen above the target mid-point. After
peaking at over 7 percent in September 2011, annual headline inflation has dropped to 5
percent in May. This decline reflects to some extent the unwinding of transitory supply factors
and the effect of the normal periodic updating of the index weights. The lagged impact of
moderating growth and the negative output gap has also exerted some downward pressure.
Credit has grown very rapidly in Brazil over the last years with a substantial increase in the
credit-to-GDP ratio. A significant portion of this likely reflects financial deepening. With the gains
on income and inclusion post-2003, new borrowers have obtained access to finance. Legal
reforms have substantially strengthened creditor rights. Moreover, the overall level of financial
development remains low by international standards, a factor that lowers stability risks. More
recently, credit growth has moderated in line with the economy, reducing the risks of
overheating in some sectors, while the large buffers in the system limit stability risks.
Capital flows have slowed in recent months. Portfolio flows remain very modest, in part due to
the traction the authorities have achieved with various capital flow management measures, but
also due to increased risk aversion in global financial markets. However, foreign direct
investment inflows (FDI) are still buoyant and continue to largely fund the current account. As
capital flows have moderated, the exchange rate has depreciated significantly against the U.S.
dollar, although it remains above the average levels of 2004-08 in real effective terms.
Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors commended the authorities’ commitment to a strong policy framework,
which has delivered a decade of macroeconomic stability and rising living standards.
Appropriately calibrating policy to changing economic conditions and increasing saving and
investment will be important challenges for the period ahead.
Directors welcomed the recent reorientation of the policy mix toward generating fiscal savings
and providing monetary countercyclical support. They encouraged the authorities to meet their
deficit target for the year to secure a declining path for the debt ratio and further boost the
credibility of their fiscal plans. Directors considered that monetary policy has been appropriately

3
eased, but noted that the authorities should stand ready to unwind the monetary stimulus if their
inflation target appears at risk.
Directors agreed that exchange rate flexibility and liquidity provision provide first lines of
defense against adverse external shocks. They also noted that capital flow management
measures (CFMs) have been a useful addition to the policy toolkit in a turbulent financial
environment. A few Directors cautioned, however, that CFMs, while helpful in the short run, do
not fully address important underlying drivers of capital inflows, could affect domestic liquidity,
and may adversely impact other capital flow recipients.
Directors considered that further efforts are needed to rebalance demand from consumption to
investment and net exports. They took note of the staff’s assessment that the real effective
exchange rate remains on the strong side despite a significant depreciation from peak levels a
year ago. Directors welcomed recent steps to strengthen saving and competitiveness, including
pension and tax reforms, but saw the need for further reforms to raise productivity. Public
investment financed by fiscal saving and further capital market deepening will also be important.
Directors welcomed the findings of the FSAP Update that the financial sector is well regulated
and supervised and that the banking system is well-placed to cope with shocks. Nonetheless,
they considered that rapid consumer credit growth, rising real estate prices, and continued
credit expansion by public banks call for continued vigilance and careful prudential oversight.
Directors commended the authorities’ plans to bring forward the implementation of elements of
Basel III, continue to make active use of macroprudential policy tools, and further boost the
soundness of the financial sector.

Statement by Paulo Nogueira Batista, Executive Director for Brazil
and Pedro Fachada, Senior Advisor to Executive Director
July 9, 2012
1.

On behalf of the Brazilian authorities, we thank staff for the useful discussions during
this year’s Article IV mission. We also thank staff for the comprehensive work as part
of the joint IMF/World Bank Financial Sector Assessment Program (FSAP). The
authorities consider that both the Article IV report and the Financial Sector Stability
Assessment (FSSA) provide valuable policy advice.

Monetary and fiscal policies
2.

At the time of the 2011 Board discussion on Brazil, the output gap had narrowed and
12-month inflation was running above the upper limit of the inflation target range. The
macroeconomic outlook changed significantly since then. In response to policy
tightening implemented in late 2010 and early 2011, coupled with external headwinds,
GDP growth decelerated faster than expected by the authorities, while inflation has
fallen significantly and is approaching the mid-point of the target range (4.5 percent).

3.

The shift in macroeconomic conditions allowed the authorities to adopt a more
expansionary stance since the second half of 2011. Monetary easing has been used as
the main countercyclical tool. Fiscal policy has been somewhat tightened to make room
for more ambitious reductions of the policy rate.

4.

Since late August 2011, the Brazilian Central Bank has cut the policy rate (known as
the Selic rate) by a cumulative 400 basis points, bringing it to historic lows in both
nominal and real terms. The reduction is larger than most observers could have
predicted some months ago. After many years of high interest rates, the authorities have
aimed at creating conditions to bring the Selic rate more in line with interest rates in the
rest of the world. They are of the view that the consolidation of the inflation targeting
regime, credibility gains brought about by eight consecutive calendar years of inflation
inside the target range, a deeper credit market and changes in the structure of financial
markets, all contribute to permanently lower interest rates. Ample liquidity and low
interest rates in the international market help achieve this objective.

5.

To facilitate the reduction of interest rates, the government announced in May changes
in the rules of the saving accounts (cadernetas de poupança), the most popular
financial instrument in Brazil – a politically difficult decision. For decades, saving
accounts offered fixed interest rates, in practice setting a floor to the Selic. According
to the new rule, saving accounts will yield 70 percent of the Selic rate whenever the
latter falls below the current level of 8.5 percent.

2

6.

The consolidated public sector primary surplus target for 2012 and 2013 has been set at
the same level as in 2011 (3.1 percent of GDP). Given the cyclical position of the
economy, this corresponds to a small increase in the structural primary surplus, as
estimated by staff. The overall fiscal deficit is expected to decline from 2.6 percent of
GDP in 2011 to below 2 percent of GDP this year.

7.

The current primary surplus target is consistent with a continuing gradual decline of the
public debt-to-GDP ratio. The net public debt fell in May to 35 percent of GDP, the
lowest since 1998 (compared to 36.4 percent of GDP in end-2011 and 39.1 percent of
GDP in end-2010). Debt dynamics benefits not only from lower financing costs, but
also from a more depreciated exchange rate as the consolidated public sector is a net
creditor is foreign currency.

External sector
8.

At 2.2 percent of GDP, the current account deficit remained relatively stable in 2011
compared to the previous year. A small improvement in the trade balance surplus was
offset by higher deficits in the services and income accounts of the balance of
payments, reflecting especially an increase in profit remittances. As in previous years,
the current account deficit was fully financed by foreign direct investment flows.
Indeed, net foreign direct investment exceeded in 2011 the current account deficit by a
considerable margin.

9.

As stressed by staff in the report, the nominal exchange rate depreciated significantly in
the recent past – as much as 30 percent in the last 12 months. This reflects in part
external factors, such as the decline in international commodity prices, a rise in
investors’ risk aversion, safe haven concerns and the appreciation of the dollar against
other major currencies. However, domestic factors are also at play, including lower
interest rate differentials and the macroprudential measures adopted by the authorities
in 2010 and 2011 to curb volatile capital flows. At end June, the level of international
reserves reached US$ 374 billion, approximately twice as high as in the pre-Lehman
period.

10.

Brazil has continued to rely on capital flow management measures (CFMs) as an
instrument to cope with large and volatile capital inflows. We welcome staff’s view
that the use of these measures to manage cyclical pressures is an “appropriate part” of
the policy tool-kit. As highlighted by staff, some inflows (most notably, portfolio
inflows) have been substantially reduced as a consequence of the introduction of CFMs,
contributing to contain exchange rate pressures. The authorities remain ready to adjust
CFMs to evolving domestic and external circumstances. For instance, in March they

3
extended from two to five years the minimum term for exemption of the IOF tax on
foreign borrowing by banks and corporations. In June, in light of adverse external
circumstances, this minimum term returned to two years.
Economic activity
11.

Available data indicates only a modest recovery of output in the first half of 2012. The
authorities expect the economy to gather momentum in the second half of 2012 as the
lagged effects of the monetary easing cycle take hold. Annual GDP growth,
nonetheless, will be low due to the weak carryover from 2011.

12.

Despite an anemic recovery so far, the labor market has remained relatively strong,
with the unemployment rate at historic lows. Favorable labor market conditions,
coupled with the real adjustment of the minimum wage in the beginning of this year,
have been supporting consumption, which grew 1 percent quarter-on-quarter in the last
quarter of 2011 and in the first quarter of 2012, well above the pace of GDP growth.

13.

We welcome staff’s analysis of the performance of Brazilian manufacturing in recent
years. After a sharp recovery in the aftermath of the 2008 crisis, manufacturing output
has stagnated since 2010. The authorities share the staff’s opinion that the
underperformance of industry has been mainly caused by a stronger exchange rate and
increasing import competition.

14.

Risks to the growth outlook are mainly associated to the international scenario. The
intensification of the euro area crisis and/or a deceleration of world growth (especially
if led by China) have the potential to affect the Brazilian economy through lower
commodity prices, reduced demand for Brazilian exports, lower investment inflows and
a weakening of confidence. As in the 2008/2009 crisis, the flexible exchange rate and
high international reserves would be the main shock absorbers in case of a deterioration
of the international scenario. At the same time, this would open additional room for
monetary easing and the use of other countercyclical tools, if needed.

15.

Brazil has a relatively low saving rate and low investment rate compared with the
country’s long-term needs. However, both the saving rate and the investment rate have
been on a gradual upward trend in recent years. The authorities continue to work
towards improving conditions for sustainable long-term growth. Given the
infrastructure gap, the public sector has a role in fostering investment, especially in the
areas of urban development, transportation and energy, which are the focus of the
Growth Acceleration Program 2 (PAC 2 – Programa de Aceleração do Crescimento).
The National Development Bank (BNDES) also continues to play a role in financing

4
investment projects, especially in light of the still high interest rates and the lack of
private long-term financing mechanisms.
Financial stability
16.

The Brazilian authorities broadly agree with the FSSA. The Brazilian financial system
is highly capitalized, profitable and well regulated and supervised. Banks have
significant capital and liquidity buffers and stress tests indicate that they are resilient to
a variety of severe shocks.

17.

The authorities remain vigilant to the build-up of risks, particularly stemming from
credit expansion. As extensively discussed in last year’s Article IV consultation, they
continue to see rapid credit growth as resulting from macroeconomic stabilization and
structural changes in the financial market that facilitated the access of the population to
financial products and reduced credit and legal risks. Despite the recent increase, creditto-GDP is still relatively low for emerging market standards, especially in the housing
segment. Staff recognized in the report (page 14) that strong bank supervision and
ample capital and income positions act as risk mitigants. Therefore, the emphasis on
credit growth as creating “pockets of vulnerability” – an expression that seems to
become routine in FSSAs – appears somewhat exaggerated.1

18.

The crisis prevention and crisis resolution frameworks are robust. The high level of
reserve requirements held by banks at the Central Bank acts as the main buffer against
liquidity shocks. Macroprudential tools have been extensively used in recent years to
contain financial stability risks. The Credit Guarantee Fund (FGC) has developed into
an important player in the banking safety net, promoting financial stability and helping
avoid banking crises through several mechanisms, including the financing of bank
acquisitions. The current resolution regime is effective and complies with international
standards. The Central Bank is studying a new banking resolution bill that will address
some gaps in the legislation.

1

In the recent FSSA for Spain, discussed by the Board in early June, the term “pockets of vulnerability” was
criticized during the meeting and altered by staff to “vulnerabilities” before publication.
