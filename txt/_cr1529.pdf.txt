KEY ISSUES
Context. The economy recovered quickly from the global crisis of 2008–09, with healthy
growth and low inflation. Growth has, however, slowed recently and is expected to
remain subdued in the short run, since gains from recovery in the U.S. will be offset by
the closure of the Intel manufacturing plant. Inflation is elevated, owing primarily to
exchange rate (XR) depreciation triggered by global repricing of emerging market assets
in early 2014. Risks to the outlook are tilted to the downside. Absent consolidation, large
fiscal deficits would make public debt dynamics unsustainable in the long-run.
The short-term policy mix should envision a lower budget deficit and vigilance
over inflation. A tighter fiscal stance would mitigate risks of inflation, external
imbalances, and start restoring long-run sustainability. The authorities should also stand
ready to increase interest rates and allow greater exchange rate flexibility if inflationary
pressures persist, especially in the absence of fiscal adjustment.
Steady fiscal consolidation is required over the medium term. The threat of
unsustainable public debt dynamics calls for corrective action, as postponing budgetary
retrenchment could seriously endanger macroeconomic stability. The authorities’ fiscal
plan, which contemplates somewhat front-loaded followed by gradual adjustment, is
appropriate to bring public debt on a sustainable footing, while maintaining robust
growth. Full specification and swift adoption of supporting measures will be critical to
achieve these objectives.
It is important to strengthen the monetary policy framework. Increasing XR
flexibility and completing the transition to inflation targeting are key. This would permit
consolidating gains in lowering inflation made in recent years.
Further improvements in financial system regulation and supervision, as well as
structural reforms to stimulate inclusive growth, are desirable. Deepening
consolidated, risk-based, and cross-border supervision as well as gradually adopting
Basel III capital and liquidity standards would further buttress financial stability.
Efficiency-enhancing measures to fuel competition, improve the education system, and
eliminate red-tape would help boost trend growth, reduce unemployment, and bolster
external competitiveness.

OVERVIEW
Costa Rica bounced back quickly from the 2008–09 global crisis, but momentum is now
slowing and macro vulnerabilities, mainly from the weak fiscal position, are rising. After falling
modestly in 2009, real GDP surged in 2010–12. Since then, however, growth has moderated below

The private capital inflows of 2012 have reversed and the exchange rate depreciated
markedly in early 2014. The current account deficit declined slightly to 5 percent of GDP in 2013
and is expected to remain broadly stable in 2014. Private capital inflows combined with government
tapping of international capital markets in 2012–13 kept the XR at the bottom of the band, with
strong accumulation of reserves by the BCCR (Figure 2). However, in the wake of U.S. monetary

policy (USMP) normalization, the colón lost 10 percent of its value between January and March 2014,
as private inflows and government use of its FX deposits ceased, while domestic residents adjusted
their portfolios toward FX assets. It has since recovered somewhat, with year-to-date depreciation
standing at 7 percent in mid-November. The BCCR intervened in an attempt to smooth excessive XR
fluctuations, selling about 6 percent of its end-2013 NIR stock, but reserves were boosted by
government Eurobond issuance in April and resumed purchases by the BCCR towards year-end.
Thus, reserves remained well within the IMF adequacy metric at end-2014 (Box 1).

Competitiveness has improved as a result of colón devaluation. The real effective
exchange rate (REER) rose by over 30 percent between 2005 and 2013, largely due to high inflation
differentials (Figure 3). Some of this appreciation was undone in 2014, as the REER declined by
4 percent with nominal depreciation outpacing a growing inflation differential. However,
multilaterally consistent estimates under the EBA and CGER approaches (Box 1) suggest that Costa
Rica’s current account and REER are broadly in line with fundamentals. Nonetheless, there are some
signs of competitiveness problems (Box 1) suggesting that productivity-enhancing reforms (¶29) and
wage restraint would help Costa Rica maintain a competitive edge. This is especially important in
light of Intel’s exit which may generate negative “signaling effects”, although its direct impact on
Costa Rica’s competitiveness is likely small. Fiscal consolidation (¶18) would also support long-term
external stability.

Box 1. Costa Rica: External Stability Assessment
Costa Rica’s real effective exchange rate (REER) is generally in line with medium-term fundamentals. Staff used
various approaches to assess the external balance and exchange rate. These included changes in the CPI-based REER,
regression-based methods to evaluate the appropriateness of the current account balance, and stability conditions for
net foreign assets.
A large nominal depreciation in 2014 combined with only a modest inflation increase partially reversed the
REER appreciation of the last 10 years. The 30 percent appreciation in the CPI-based REER since 2003 has been
mostly driven by inflation differential with the main trading partner, the U.S. With year-to-date depreciation at
7 percent in mid-November and outpacing inflation (below 6 percent in October), the REER has declined by 4 percent.
Nonetheless the current account deficit has remained broadly stable and the market share has improved. The
current account deficit has hovered close to 5 percent of GDP, as a strong positive services balance partly offsets a
negative non-oil trade balance. Costa Rica has gained export market share during the same period in contrast to
other emerging markets (Figure 3).
The financing structure of the current account and relatively low external liabilities mitigate risks. The current
account is mostly financed by FDI inflows, which have hovered at around 5 percent of GDP. As a result, while the IIP is
negative at over 35 percent of GDP, FDI comprises more than 60 percent of total liabilities. The external debt profile
presents no sustainability concerns, with the external debt-to-GDP ratio set to decline into the medium term, and with
a low share of short-term debt. Net international reserves stood at 5.6 months of non-maquila imports of goods and
services at end-2013 and are within the Fund’s composite reserve adequacy metric.

IMF’s multilaterally consistent estimates suggest that Costa Rica’s REER is broadly in line with fundamentals
both in the short term and relative to medium-term benchmarks.



The macro balance approach in the External Balance Assessment (EBA) is estimated on the basis of existing
fundamentals and desirable policies. It points to a sustainable cyclically-adjusted current account deficit of
5.4 percent of GDP, which is about 1¼ percentage point larger than the actual cyclically-adjusted deficit of
4.2 percent, implying and undervaluation of 4¾ percent. Identified policy gaps are a significant contributor
to Costa Rica’s relatively large estimated current account norm, in particular health expenditures which are
higher than the world average.



The macro balance approach in the CGER methodologies (which rely on medium term fundamentals) points
to an estimated REER undervaluation of barely less than 1 percent.



The CGER benchmark external sustainability approach, on the other hand, finds a moderate
overvaluation of 13¼ percent. However, in order to interpret appropriately these estimates, the

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

7

COSTA RICA

Box 1. Costa Rica: External Stability Assessment (concluded)
significant proportion of FDI in Costa Rica’s total external liabilities should be taken into account. Thus, if
FDI is excluded from NFA, an undervaluation of little less than 6 percent is assessed.


The WHD staff model is based on a current account regression that is similar to the CGER macro balance
approach, but includes an additional variable capturing the speed of aging, the youth dependency ratio
instead of population growth, changes in oil price for oil producers instead of the oil balance, and a measure
of trade openness. This method suggests the REER is broadly in line with fundamentals, with an
undervaluation of about 1½ percent, in line with EBA estimates.

In staff’s view, the macro-balance-type approaches—which all point to a small undervaluation—are most reliable,
while a simple average across the different reliable methodologies implies virtually no over- or under- valuation.
Given model uncertainty and standard errors, staff concludes that Costa Rica’s REER is broadly in line with
fundamentals.
Nevertheless, there are some signs of competitiveness problems. In contrast to the other countries in the region,
Costa Rica has gained market share over the past decade. Nonetheless, further steps to improve competiveness may
be needed. Costa Rica lost five positions in the 2015 Doing Business Survey partly driven by a dteterioration in the
“starting a business” category where the country lost ten positions. Moreover, according to the Global
Competitiveness Index, inadequate infrastructure, difficulty in accessing finance, and concerns over inefficient
government spending weigh on the country’s competitiveness.

The achievements in containing public spending of 2011 came to a halt in 2012–2013,
with public debt continuing to climb (Figure 4). The efforts to restrain government outlays, mainly
through capital expenditure cuts in 2011, were undermined by the rising transfers and interest bill in
2012–2013. While expenditures continued climbing, revenues stagnated. As a result, the central
government (CG) deficit increased by 1¼ percentage points of GDP in 2012–13 to 5½ percent of
GDP and debt reached 36 percent of GDP in 2013.

6.

The new government acknowledges the need for fiscal consolidation and is developing
a strategy focused on strengthening revenue. After nullification of the 2012 tax reform by the
Supreme Court due to procedural irregularities, the previous administration prepared a roadmap
with measures yielding a potential adjustment of about 3½ percent of GDP over five years, broadly
in line with previous staff recommendations to ensure long-term sustainability. However, no action
was taken before the elections. The new administration, which took office in May 2014, has
formulated a consolidation proposal of its own, initially focused on reducing tax evasion and a few
exemptions. In this connection, a new draft anti-tax evasion law, which includes measures to reduce
income tax expenditures as well as strengthen tax control, was submitted to Congress but the
potential impact on revenues from its administrative provisions remains unclear. Since then, a more
comprehensive plan has been developed (¶21).

Domestic monetary and financial conditions are
broadly neutral. Following a substantial increase in domestic
interest rates, driven by large government borrowing and
buoyant private sector credit demand in 2012, financial
conditions eased in early 2013 as the government reduced
reliance on domestic financing with Eurobond placements
(Figure 5). However, interest rates started rising again in the

second half of 2013, as global financial conditions tightened. A broad-based index (FCI) developed
by staff (featuring the influence on economic activity of interest rates, REER, house prices, equity
prices, VIX, U.S. interest rate) suggests that financial conditions were neither propelling nor dragging
GDP growth earlier in 2014, even before the latest policy rate raise (AN 5). At the same time, growth
of credit to the private sector, excluding the impact on the stock of FX credit from the devaluation of
the colón, has moderated somewhat in H2. Nonetheless, credit growth, supported by a generally
healthy financial system (¶9), remains robust and consistent with continued benign financial
deepening. Credit composition shifted away from foreign currency loans, while, conversely, deposits
moved towards foreign currency in the wake of XR depreciation.

The financial system appears sound, though dollarization continues to be a source of
vulnerability. Capital is well above regulatory requirements (Figure 5). Liquidity indicators are

B. Macroeconomic Outlook and Risks
The authorities agreed that the outlook for 2015 and the medium term will remain
subdued amid deteriorating fundamentals. Growth in 2015 is expected to remain virtually
unchanged as the negative impact of a gradual Intel withdrawal offsets again the positive impact of

of elaboration in the authorities’ stated plans (¶21).
The output gap is projected to widen through 2016, then mostly closing over the medium term, with
growth also converging to potential. The CG fiscal deficit would stay at about 5¾ percent of GDP
and the public debt ratio would approach 51 percent of GDP by 2019. Thanks to continued prudent
monetary policy, inflation is projected to hover around 4 percent after returning within the band in
early 2015, while the current account deficit rises to 5¼ percent of GDP by 2019.

1/ The baseline scenario includes fiscal consolidation measures of about 2¼ percent of GDP, partly
offset by a projected underlying deterioration in the primary balance mainly driven by the
constitutionally mandated increase in education expenditure.

The authorities also concurred that an alternative scenario incorporating the fiscal
adjustment necessary to restore debt sustainability would yield a stronger outlook. According
to staff analysis, a total adjustment of about 3¾ percent of GDP would achieve the objective of stabilizing
debt with only moderate short-term output costs (¶19). A tighter fiscal stance consistent with restoring
debt sustainability would mitigate increases in market rates, allow for a more balanced macro policy mix
to achieve the inflation target, and reduce the current account deficit.

Risks to the outlook are tilted to the downside. Downside risks stem from both global
uncertainties and weaknesses in domestic fundamentals (as detailed in the Risk Assessment Matrix):

12.



External risks. Concerning faster USMP normalization slightly upside risks prevail, absent
pronounced increases in market volatility (Figure 6). Under these conditions, higher U.S.
growth would have a positive impact on Costa Rican GDP given its strong trade ties with the
U.S. more than offsetting the negative impact of tighter global financial conditions in the
short run (AN 2). However, extreme bouts of market volatility could inflict serious damage,
especially given Costa Rica’s weak fiscal position, as interest rates may rise abruptly (Figure 6
INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

11

COSTA RICA

and Figure 4). Moreover, if USMP normalization leads to substantial exchange rate
depreciation in Costa Rica and reduction in the availability of foreign funding, bank and
private sector balance sheets could be negatively affected, with adverse implications for
growth, inflation, and the balance of payments. In addition, deeper-than-expected slowdowns
in advanced and emerging markets could hamper Costa Rica’s growth. The effects of global
factors may be amplified by strong linkages with the U.S. (AN 2). On the other hand, further
sustained declines in energy prices, triggered by deceleration of global demand and comingon-stream of excess capacity, could have a modest positive impact on Costa Rica.

Domestic risks. The persistence of a large fiscal deficit (for instance, owing to political
difficulties in implementing tax reform (¶22)), and the ensuing rise in the public debt ratio,
could render the economy vulnerable to sudden changes in financial market conditions. Also,
large government gross financing requirements could lift domestic interest rates, weighing
on private investment and growth. In addition, a slowdown in FDI due to the “signaling
effect” from Intel exit could reduce growth more than expected in the short run.

INTEL’s withdrawal and external competition weighs
down on FDI and leads to an increase in
unemployment and a reduction in productivity growth
as the enterprises with a more sophisticated export

POLICY DISCUSSIONS
Discussions centered on the policy mix appropriate for current cyclical conditions and
mitigation of longer-term economic vulnerabilities. In particular, the latter focused on how to:
(i) restore fiscal sustainability; (ii) improve the monetary policy framework; (iii) further enhance
financial system supervision and regulation; and (iv) boost potential and inclusive growth.

13.

A. Near-term Policy Mix
The authorities appropriately intend to begin fiscal adjustment in 2015, thereby
buttressing macro-economic stability and making a head start towards long-term
sustainability. There was agreement that budgetary adjustment in 2015 would contribute to
mitigate risks of higher inflation, widening external imbalances, and possible adverse financial market
reactions. It would also represent a first critical step to reduce the sustainability gap (¶18). Although
the 2015 budget passed by Parliament envisages, in the absence of measures, a further increase in
the CG deficit to about 7 percent of GDP, the government plans a correction of about 1¼ percent of
GDP in 2015 (as noted, most of the supporting measures, including VAT reform and cuts in transfers
(¶21) are at an advanced stage of elaboration and are included in the baseline). In staff’s view, this
correction would be suitable (¶19 and AN 3), taking into consideration inflation and fiscal
sustainability concerns as well as the cyclical position of the economy. It will be critical, though, to
implement on a timely basis the planned measures, including speedy adoption of the VAT reform
and freeze in real salaries (¶21).

14.

There was agreement that the monetary stance is adequate but policy should remain
nimble to guard against the risk of higher-than-anticipated inflation (¶3). At 5.25 percent, the
monetary policy rate is close to the estimated neutral rate of 5.0–5.1 percent, implying a broadly
appropriate stance, given output close to potential. This conclusion is also supported by indications
of neutral domestic financial conditions (¶8), and, as the authorities emphasized, by moderating
credit growth generally consistent with benign financial deepening. However, staff argued that
higher inflation risks prevail due to: (i) higher-than-estimated pass-through and second round effects
from currency depreciation; (ii) possibly faster U.S. growth; (iii) bigger-than-assumed regulated price
hikes, though these are now more unlikely given recent declines in oil prices. These risks are not
expected to be outweighed by larger-than-anticipated oil price drop or slowdown due to Intel
withdrawal. Accordingly, staff urged the BCCR to stand ready to raise rates if inflation does not
decline as anticipated, particularly if it persists above the upper limit of the target range. The
authorities reiterated their readiness to adjust the policy rate depending on inflation developments.

B. Safeguarding Fiscal Sustainability
The authorities recognized that current fiscal trends are unsustainable in the long term.
Without policy action, the CG deficit would be above 9 percent of GDP and debt rise above
60 percent by 2019. Even in the baseline scenario, which incorporates a fiscal adjustment of
2¼ percent of GDP, the CG deficit would persist at about 5¾ percent of GDP by 2019, owing to a
mounting interest bill and constitutionally-mandated education spending. Correspondingly, CG debt
would grow to 51 percent of GDP by 2019 (from 36 percent of GDP at end-2013), further raising
vulnerabilities and potentially eroding the underpinnings of macroeconomic stability.

The authorities also acknowledged that the pension system’s financial position has to
be strengthened in the long run. The pension plan run by the Social Security agency (CCSS) and
those of the judiciary and the teachers are actuarially imbalanced. They are projected to turn a cash
deficit over the long term due to system maturation and population aging (AN 3). Preliminary
projections suggest that an adjustment equivalent to about 1½ percent of GDP would be required to
ensure actuarial equilibrium of all pension systems for the next 100 years. The authorities indicated
that a joint study (by the CCSS and the Superintendence of Pensions) to be released in 2015 would
determine the size the imbalance.

17.

There was agreement on the amount of fiscal adjustment needed to stabilize the public
debt ratio. In staff’s estimates, fiscal retrenchment amounting to about 3¾ percent of GDP over the
medium-term would suffice to stabilize the public debt ratio below levels which are shown to pose
risks for macro stability in emerging markets (Annex II). The authorities concurred and intend to
consolidate public finances by about 4 percent of GDP over the medium term. The authorities also
acknowledged that in the longer run further parametric adjustment would be needed to remedy the
actuarial imbalance of the pension system (¶17)—including larger contributions, lower replacement
rates, and higher retirement age.

1/ This path is the baseline through 2019, with a constant primary balance thereafter.
2/ The immediate and gradual adjustment scenarios aim at closing the same initial sustainability gap with consolidation starting in
2015 in both scenarios. The debt stabilizing primary balance is calculated based on medium-term baseline projections of real interest
and growth rates that are maintained constant over the projection period in line with the requirements of the optimization model
(AN 3). The gap is then measured relative to the 2014 projected fiscal outturn.
3/ The gradual scenario assumes that the authorities place 90 percent weight on the growth objective. Impact of growth is based on
fiscal multiplier of 0.3, with a self-correction parameter for the output gap of 0.5, implying that the effect on the output gap of a fiscal
adjustment of 1 percent of GDP almost dissipates—is less than 0.1 percent of GDP—in the second year following the adjustment.
4/ The immediate adjustment scenario assumes that the full fiscal adjustment takes place in 2015 and has no impact on growth.

authorities agreed that about two-thirds of the needed adjustment (or 2½ percent of GDP) had to
rely on revenue increases. The emphasis on revenue enhancement was considered appropriate given
Costa Rica’s low revenue effort compared to other upper-middle-income countries.

20.

Moreover, the supporting measures identified by the government are advisable,
though some important steps still need to be fleshed out.

21.


The authorities have readied a legislative proposal to broaden the base of the VAT to include
services and basic goods (the latter at a reduced rate), but the bill to reform the income tax
(by eliminating some exemptions and moving from schedular to global determination of the
tax liability) has not been finalized yet. Most of the measures for reducing expenditures also
have to be fully articulated.



Staff acknowledged that major revenue gains may be accrued by reducing tax exemptions
and other special treatments (e.g. to enlarge the base of the VAT), but stressed that the
substantial budget consolidation required will also demand increases in tax rates over the
medium term. Specifically, staff recommended raising the VAT rate from 13 to 15 percent

gradually and increasing marginal rates on higher-income brackets. The latter could also
compensate for any regressive impact of hiking VAT rates. The authorities confirmed their
willingness to raise the VAT rate in steps starting in 2016, consistent with the consolidation
recommended by the staff.



The authorities also considered important actions to strengthen tax compliance, including
the draft anti-tax evasion law recently submitted to parliament. Staff agreed with the need to
strengthen tax administration, but cautioned that yields from such initiatives are generally
uncertain and far from immediate.



The authorities expressed their commitment to expenditure tightening. In particular, they
concurred that efforts should start in 2015 and concentrate on containing growth of current
spending, especially of the wage bill and transfers, through modifying indexation to prevent
automatic real salary increases and improving efficiency of the civil service, including through
a partial employment freeze. This would also support desirable increases in growth-friendly
capital spending, in line with authorities’ efforts to improve project execution. In this
connection, staff cautioned on the need to contain risks of contingent liabilities and
additional pressures on domestic financing resulting from new off-budget investment
vehicles contemplated by the authorities.



Staff estimates that the proposals at a more advanced stage of elaboration are likely to yield
some 2¼ percent of GDP, as included in the baseline scenario (¶10). The remaining measures
needed to generate the required total adjustment of 3¾ percent of GDP ought to be defined
urgently, not least to obtain more reliable estimates of their impact.

In addition, most deficit-reducing measures require parliamentary approval, which is
made difficult by a complex political situation. The new administration should take advantage of
its high political capital to push forward reforms early in its mandate, not least to persuade the
powerful public sector unions to accept sacrifices (the containment of wage growth in the public
sector does not require parliamentary approval). Nevertheless, the government noted that it only has
a minority representation in Congress, hence passage of several budget consolidation measures
requires the cooperation of opposition parties. Lingering resentments from the bitter presidential
campaign raise concerns about legislative approval of adjustment measures, notably the reforms of
the VAT and income taxes. Nonetheless, there appears to be broad consensus across the political
spectrum and society at large that fiscal retrenchment is needed. Thus, there may be scope for
leveraging containment of public sector wages to bargain for revenue increases.

22.

C. Improving the Monetary and Exchange Rate Policy Framework
Discussions identified areas to strengthen further the monetary policy framework. Staff
commended the authorities’ achievements in lowering inflation since the global crisis. Having posted
double-digit inflation for almost 30 years, Costa Rica has maintained it within the BCCR target range
of 4–6 percent since 2009 (the range was further reduced to 3–5 percent in 2014). However, the
recent depreciation episode illustrated that inflation expectations are not well-anchored. Moreover,
perceived exchange rate stability in the past few years has encouraged dollarization, building up
vulnerabilities in the balance sheets of banks and the private sector. The FX intervention rule, which
aims both to avert excessive volatility and counter excessive deviations from medium-term
fundamentals, remains undisclosed. Staff noted that lack of transparency may undermine confidence
in the subordination of XR management objectives to the inflation target.

23.

The authorities aim to move towards full-fledged inflation targeting, while maintaining
a significant role for active XR management. Staff argued that allowing more XR flexibility would
help establish inflation as the undisputed monetary anchor and lower XR pass-through to inflation.
In particular, since appreciation pressures have now subsided, it is an opportune time for abandoning
the XR band. More flexibility would enhance the role of the XR as a shock absorber and make market
participants more cognizant of two-way risks in exchange markets, promoting the development and
use of hedging facilities and the reduction of foreign currency mismatches, while more generally
discouraging dollarization. The elimination of the band would not preclude the BCCR from engaging
in FX market interventions to smooth out short-term sharp XR fluctuations and strengthen the NIR
position as long as interventions do not jeopardize the inflation target. The authorities agreed in
principle, but stressed the need to remain vigilant about the impact of XR movements on financial
stability and inflation expectations given the high levels of dollarization and unhedged FX borrowing.
Specifically, officials noted that other “inflation-targeting” central banks intervene frequently to stem
excessive XR volatility and they are likely to follow this mold. The authorities were also cautious
about making the intervention rule public due to the fear of facilitating speculation.

For maturities less than 270 days.
The prudential framework was not in place to control the overall risk exposure of banks, with identified shortcomings mainly regarding the prudential regulation of banks' exposure to FX risk. Corporates in general

5

(and banks) were making active use of the futures markets to hedge their exposures or to take speculative positions. Market participants were not accustomed to assessing, as a matter of routine, the FX risks posed by
regular market volatility.
6
For Chile, all controls were removed shortly before or with the float. For Brazil, controls were liberalized gradually during the 1990s (inflow controls of 1993-96 liberalized by 1999), with further liberalization for
nonresident investments after the float.
In the Czech Republic, most inflows and outflows had been liberalized by 1997, but certain inflow transactions (including financial derivatives) were liberalized in early 1999, following a transition period to phase out

7

the remaining controls under the agreement with the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), with full liberalization taking place in 2002, until which time certain transactions (including some
selective derivatives operations and short-term portfolio and deposit transactions) had remained controlled.
8

Spot market is relatively shallow and the central bank does not comprehensively collect information on spot transactions on regular basis.

9

Derivatives market is unregulated. Hence, while there are no restrictions on derivatives transactions, it is not clear how the associated risks are assessed by the supervisor and how the derivatives market functions in

practice.
10

The interbank market is underdeveloped with low degree of market depth.

11

The securities market is largely limited to primary market in government securities, secondary market in repos of government securities, and a very thin stock market.
While the prudential framework to control the overall FX risk exposure of the banks as well as the measures to reduce FX risks is in place, it is somewhat obsolete. The private sector does not use derivatives to hedge

12

their exposures on routine basis and market participants in general are not accustomed to assessing the FX risks posed by regular market volatility. After the depreciation episode in 2014, the CB introduced some
measures to smooth volatility in the FX market, including new requisitions for the buying/selling of FX by public sector entities. Specifically, before June 2014, the CB participated in the FX market in order to replenish
NIR that was withdrawn by the public sector. Now, the CB can decide discretionally when and how to do this replenishment.
13
14

While monetary framework is largely in place, the transmission mechnism from policy rates to the market rates is rather weak.
While there are no capital controls currently in place, a recently adopted law empowers the executive, upon consultation with the Central Bank, to impose temporary restrictions on inflows of short-term capital

through taxation and compulsory deposits with the Central Bank.

COSTA RICA

Steady progress has been made to create a favorable environment for inflation
targeting, but more may be needed. The experience of countries that successfully transitioned to
more flexible XR regimes (AN 6) suggests the importance of strengthening effective systems for
reviewing and managing the exposure to XR risk. In this regard, staff welcomed bank supervision
stipulations adopted in 2013, aimed at a more thorough assessment of credit risks related to XR
exposures and associated need for higher provisions. The authorities concurred that fostering further
development of the secondary market for government securities is also desirable. Finally, staff
counseled to resist pressures to expand the BCCR’s mandate to include growth, which could
generate confusion as to the main target of monetary policy. Additional steps to buttress BCCR
credibility further, including by fortifying its balance sheet, could also be useful (AN 4).

25.

D. Financial Stability
Officials acknowledged that limited progress has been made in implementing pending
recommendations from the 2008 FSAP update (Annex 1). Advances have been slow, largely due to
a crowded legislative agenda. In particular, legislation aimed at empowering the Superintendence of
Financial Institutions to conduct consolidated supervision, providing adequate protection to bank
supervisors, and strengthening bank resolution procedures has been stalled in Congress for 8 years.
The authorities are preparing new proposals to replace the old draft laws but the time-frame for their
completion and the degree of alignment of the new laws with the 2008 FSAP update
recommendations is not clear. The authorities noted, in particular, that introduction of further legal
protection for bank supervisors faces strong opposition and may run into court challenges. Staff
endorsed progress made towards full implementation of risk-based supervision, but encouraged
stepping up efforts to bring it up to best practices.

26.

The authorities concurred that gradual adoption of Basel III standards would further
improve resilience of the financial system. The authorities believe that the regulatory and risk
management frameworks would benefit from gradually firming up capital quality and increasing
liquidity and capital requirements in line with Basel III standards. In particular, moving towards the
introduction of Basel III definitions of capital, a capital conservation buffer, and a leverage ratio as
well as incorporating market and operational risk capital requirements should be immediate
priorities. Staff assessment suggests that only a few banks are not yet in full compliance with Basel III
standards (AN 7) and that adopting Basel III capital requirements would have negligible growth
impact in Costa Rica.

27.

Regional initiatives to upgrade cross-border consolidated supervision are important,
but additional improvements are needed to alleviate lingering spillover risks. Effective
supervision of cross-border financial operations is critical for stability, in particular because financial
linkages within the region are not fully understood, owing in part to data limitations but also to legal
restrictions on information sharing. Enhancing transnational monitoring is especially important for
Costa Rica since its large conglomerate BCT operates in Panama. In this regard, officials emphasized
the existence of a data sharing agreement with Panama, but staff underscored that cross-border
consolidated supervision seems overall less advanced in Costa Rica compared to other countries in
the region. Specifically, though it welcomed Costa Rica’s participation in the system of multilateral

E. Structural Reforms
The authorities support structural reforms to buttress Costa Rica’s competitiveness and
promote inclusive growth. While Costa Rica has been the regional leader in attracting foreign
direct investment, the recent withdrawal of Intel suggests that further steps are needed to maintain
the country’s competitive edge. Within the region, the country is relatively well-positioned in the
electricity market—more than 80 percent of electricity comes from renewable sources, technical
losses are relatively low, and industrial tariffs are the lowest in the region. Nevertheless, the cost of
electricity is high compared to Asian competitors, which are generally more efficient at electricity
production. Staff recommended increasing private sector participation in the energy sector and
reviewing tariff setting procedures to enhance cost discipline. While Costa Rica ranks highly on
women’s educational attainment compared to other countries in the region, it lags in terms of
economic participation and opportunity for women, reflected in low female labor force participation
and the gender wage gap (Figure 7). With regards to human capital, the authorities agreed that
improving the quality of public education spending with emphasis on quality child care and early
childhood education could facilitate female return to the labor force, foster productivity
improvements, and lower inequality, which has been recently on the rise. Officials also concurred that
stimulating competition in the banking sector, fostering the development of the domestic capital
market, addressing infrastructure bottlenecks, and streamlining business regulations could accelerate
potential growth and improve financial inclusion. According to staff estimates, efficiency gains from
these measures could increase trend growth by up to 2 percentage points, while reducing
unemployment by 3 percent over the long run (Figure 7).

STAFF APPRAISAL
Costa Rica must address existing vulnerabilities and attain long-term fiscal
sustainability, while upgrading productivity and safeguarding financial stability. In the near
term, a tighter fiscal policy stance and vigilance over inflation would buttress macroeconomic
stability. At the same time, public finances should be placed on a sustainable path, the monetary
policy framework strengthened, and banking sector supervision and regulation further enhanced.
Reforms to foster competition, increase efficiency, and promote external competitiveness would
accelerate long-run inclusive growth.

30.

With long-term fiscal trends unsustainable, ambitious fiscal consolidation is needed,
though it can be implemented at a measured pace. Excluding the pension system actuarial deficit,
a permanent improvement in the fiscal primary balance of 3¾ percent of GDP is required to stabilize
the public debt ratio after 2019 at a prudent level and safeguard macroeconomic stability. Given that
output is close to potential, the rapid growth of public debt calls for significant upfront fiscal
tightening, with about a third of the overall budget adjustment in 2015 followed by smaller steps in
subsequent years. Postponing consolidation would result in larger tightening needs to stabilize debtto-GDP and increase the probability of disorderly adjustment in the event of an adverse turn in
investor sentiment. While the social security actuarial deficit could be addressed at a later stage, the
longer the correction is delayed, the larger it will be.

31.

Thus, the authorities’ fiscal adjustment plan of about 4 percent of GDP is suitable, but
supporting measures still need to be fully developed and implemented. The plan’s emphasis on
revenue enhancement is well-founded, given Costa Rica’s low revenue effort compared to other
upper-middle-income countries. However, the proposals at a more advanced phase of elaboration
are likely to yield only some 2¼ percent of GDP. Other measures still need to be fleshed out and
virtually all have to be enacted. On the revenue side, it is advisable to broaden the VAT base and
raise the VAT rate from 13 to 15 percent, as well as to increase marginal tax rates on higher income
brackets as part of the introduction of a global income tax, thereby addressing also distributional
concerns. Efforts to contain growth of current outlays, particularly the wage bill and transfers, should
be stepped up, thus creating space for much needed infrastructural spending. Although recent

32.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

25

COSTA RICA

actions to strengthen tax compliance are positive, associated revenue gains are likely to materialize
only in the longer term.
The monetary stance is broadly appropriate, but the authorities should complete the
transition to inflation targeting. Current monetary policy is expected to support the reentry of
inflation within the target band, though vigilance is warranted in case inflation does not decline in
line with projections. Elimination of the XR band and concurrent adoption of a more transparent
intervention rule would establish the inflation target as the undisputed bearing of monetary policy,
while still allowing for smoothing out exchange rate volatility. At the same time, higher XR flexibility
would help lower the XR pass-through to inflation and force market participants to internalize
currency risks, discouraging dollarization. It is important to foster development of the tools necessary
to underpin greater XR flexibility, including hedging instruments and a deeper secondary market for
government securities. The authorities should also avoid expanding the BCCR’s mandate to include
growth, which could generate confusion as to the true target of monetary policy.

33.

Enactment of the pending FSAP recommendations, a gradual move towards Basel III
standards, and strengthening cross-border supervision are important. In particular, greater
urgency is required in empowering the Superintendence of Financial Institutions to conduct
consolidated and transnational supervision, providing adequate protection to bank supervisors, and
enhancing bank resolution procedures. Progress made towards the full implementation of risk-based
supervision is welcome, but more efforts are needed to bring it in line with best practices. The
regulatory and risk management frameworks would greatly benefit from introducing gradually
Basel III standards.

34.

Structural reforms offer the opportunity to boost productivity and foster long-run
inclusive growth. It would be desirable to step up private sector participation in the energy sector
and review tariff setting procedures to strengthen cost controls. Ameliorating efficiency and efficacy
of education spending, with the focus on early childhood, could raise women’s labor force
participation, stimulate productivity, and reduce inequality in the long term. Promoting competition
in the banking sector, facilitating capital market development, alleviating infrastructure bottlenecks,
and simplifying the regulatory environment would also buttress competitiveness and accelerate
potential growth.

35.

It is recommended that the next Article IV consultation be held on the standard 12month cycle.

Annex I. Costa Rica. Financial System Assessment Program (FSAP)
Main Pending Recommendations (2008)
Recommendations
A. Prudential Supervision and Regulation
Amend the legal framework in order to provide protection
for supervisors while performing their responsibilities in
good faith.

Introduce pertinent laws for the Superintendency of Banks
(SUGEF) to be able to supervise banking groups (including
offshore structures) on a consolidated basis. Upon the
approval of such laws the SUGEF should issue without delay
operational regulations to ensure its rapid implementation
by the banking system.
Apply higher risk weight ratios to unhedged borrowers for
capital adequacy purposes.

Comments
Art. 28 of Insurance Law 8653 of August 7, 2008, provides legal
protection to insurance supervisors. The reform to provide
protection for bank supervisors was originally included in a
draft reform of the BCCR law but subsequently dismissed.
Currently, there is only legal protection for auditors.
This reform was originally included in a draft reform of the
BCCR law but subsequently dismissed.

Amendment to capital adequacy regulation took effect in
August 2013. This implemented gradual increases in the
percentages over 18 months, to reach final levels of 125% for
unhedged borrowers and 62.5% for those with residential
mortgages by March 2015. 1
Modify the funding arrangements for supervision, in line
A draft legislation to recapitalize the central bank also
with international best practices.
addresses the increase in the financing share of the industry.
B. Crisis Management and Bank Crisis Resolution Framework
Amend article 155 of the Central Bank law in order to grant
the SUGEF an appropriate range of supervisory tools to
require a bank to take prompt remedial action and to
impose penalties in accordance with the gravity of a
situation.
Amend the rating system for prompt corrective actions, to
include new directives that allow the SUGEF to take an
appropriate range of remedial actions and supervisory
decisions.
Improve the early warning system, to allow the adoption of
remedial actions in a timely manner.
Eliminate the emergency loan window and improve the
design and operational arrangements of the ordinary
rediscount window, including by establishing prudential
limits in terms of regulatory capital.

This reform was originally included in a draft reform of the
BCCR law but subsequently dismissed.

The authorities intend to amend the rating system once riskbased supervision is fully in place (currently expected in 2017,
with major reforms to be conducted in 2015 and 2016).1
The authorities will review the possibility of taking a broader
range of remedial actions within the scope of the existing law.
The emergency line introduced during the 2008-09 crisis was
discontinued and two high-access rediscount windows were
created in 2011: (i) using bonds already included in the money
market collateral pool; and (ii) using commercial credit
portfolio as collateral (with strict rules on quality and haircuts).
Both lines are available in US dollars and in colones. However,
the rediscount windows are activated only when a central bank
committee considers that there is a systemic risk; operational
procedures need to be further streamlined; and repo
operations are still to be linked to prudential limits in terms of
regulatory capital.

Establish a deposit insurance scheme, in line with
international best practices.
Amend the bank resolution legal framework to include
purchase and assumption type techniques.
Enable voluntary, extra-judicial corporate restructuring
agreements.

Annex II. Costa Rica: Public Debt Sustainability Analysis
(Higher Scrutiny Case)
The DSA highlights Costa Rica’s unsustainable debt dynamics. The debt stock is projected to rise
to 51 percent of GDP by 2019 under the baseline scenario, driven mostly by high fiscal deficits.
There are substantial upside risks to the projected debt path from plausible macro shocks. Risks
from relatively high financing needs are somewhat mitigated by the existence of a stable
domestic investor base.

Key Assumptions
Debt definition. The public debt sustainability analysis focuses on the central government level
where the worsening of the fiscal situation has taken place in recent years. The rest of the
consolidated public sector has been broadly in balance in recent years as the cash surplus of the
social security system broadly offset the small central bank deficit—resulting from its liquidity
management operations—while public enterprises are broadly in balance.1 The additional
adjustment needed—about 1½ percent of GDP—to close the actuarial deficit that opens up over
the medium and long-term is estimated separately.
Growth and fiscal policy assumptions. The baseline reflects the estimated growth potential of
4.3 percent. The baseline scenario assumes fiscal adjustment of about 2¼ of GDP based on the
staff’s assessment of measures at a more advanced stage of elaboration in the medium-term
adjustment plan announced by the authorities. The improvement in the primary balance is smaller
due to the projected deterioration in the fiscal position under a passive scenario, driven mostly by
increases in expenditure on education to reach expenditure targets defined under the constitution.
Debt target. In theory it is difficult to justify a unique threshold for debt-to-GDP ratio as the
government is deemed solvent if it can generate future primary surpluses sufficient to service its
outstanding debt, hence, protracted large budget deficits are not necessarily inconsistent with
sustainability, provided that primary surpluses can be generated in the future. In practice, however,
such an approach may require large future adjustments, which may not be feasible or desirable,
economically and politically. A more operational definition of public debt sustainability offered in
the 2003 WEO suggests that a given public debt level is sustainable if it implies that the
government’s budget constraint (in NPV terms) is satisfied without unrealistically large future
corrections in the primary balance. It also emphasizes the importance of liquidity conditions,
because even if a government satisfies its present value budget constraint, it may not have sufficient
assets and financing available to meet or roll over its maturing liabilities. As practical guidance,
empirical evidence indicates that, for emerging market economies, sustaining a debt-to-GDP ratio
above 50 percent of GDP may be difficult. For example, the WEO (2003) finds that the median public
1
The basics output table for the DSA at the consolidated public sector level shows that the estimated sustainability
gap in 2019 is lower than at the central government level, given lower actual and projected primary deficits and
average interest rates at the consolidated level.

COSTA RICA

debt-to-GDP ratio for emerging markets in the year before a default was about 50 percent of
GDP. This study also concludes that, on average, the conduct of fiscal policy in emerging market
economies is not consistent with ensuring sustainability once public debt exceeds a threshold of
50 percent of GDP. Moreover, WEO (2003) argues that a sustainable debt level may be lower for
countries that have relatively low revenue-to-GDP ratio, high volatility of the revenue-to-GDP, as
well as a weak track record of fiscal consolidations. Given that Costa Rica has low and fairly volatile
revenue-to-GDP ratio, compared to other emerging markets, and has not demonstrated the ability
to achieve substantial expenditure consolidation in the past decade, the debt threshold for Costa
Rica should be significantly lower than 50 percent of GDP to provide a safety margin against the risk
of default or at least severe budget funding problems. This is why targeting an upper bound to the
public debt ratio of 40 to 45 percent of GDP appears justifiable in the case of Costa Rica.

Results and Assessment
Results. In the baseline, the headline deficit remains close to 6 percent of GDP in 2019, as the higher
interest bill from rising public debt—which reaches 51 percent of GDP in 2019 and stays on an
upward trajectory thereafter—largely offsets the improvement in the primary balance. The gross
financing needs would average almost 10 percent of GDP in 2014–19. In the adjustment scenario,
additional measures of 1½ of GDP, as part of a gradual but frontloaded consolidation plan, suffice
to stabilize debt by 2019 at a level below 45 percent of GDP. This outcome assumes significant
tightening in credit spreads driven by favorable market reaction to a frontloaded adjustment plan
with credible measures.
Assessment. While most standard debt profile characteristics are not at “danger” levels (see heatmap), the debt and gross financing needs approach the debt burden benchmarks under stressed
scenarios. In particular, debt rises above 60 percent of GDP under the combined macro-fiscal shock,
with particularly high sensitivity to growth and fiscal shocks. Debt profile indicators also highlight
risks from relatively high spreads on external bonds, elevated financing needs, and significant
external and FX debt. The recent loss of the sovereign’s only investment grade rating and warnings
of potential downgrades by other main agencies highlight the risk that credit risk perceptions could
intensify.
Mitigating factors. A stable investor base is an important mitigating factor. Notwithstanding the
moderate risk ratings for external and FX debt in the debt profile indicators heat map, the share of
these types of debt are at the low end of the reference range for moderate risk countries—external
and FX debt represent about 20 and 30 percent of total debt, respectively, compared to benchmark
ranges of 15 to 45 for external debt and 20 to 60 for FX debt. Moreover, about 60 percent of
domestic debt is held by captive local institutional investors, including the social security system,
nonfinancial public sector institutions, and banks.

1/ Public sector is defined as central government.
2/ Based on available data.
3/ EMBIG.
4/ Defined as interest payments divided by debt stock (excluding guarantees) at the end of previous year.
5/ Derived as [(r - π(1+g) - g + ae(1+r)]/(1+g+π+gπ)) times previous period debt ratio, with r = interest rate; π = growth rate of GDP deflator; g = real GDP growth rate;
a = share of foreign-currency denominated debt; and e = nominal exchange rate depreciation (measured by increase in local currency value of U.S. dollar).
6/ The real interest rate contribution is derived from the numerator in footnote 5 as r - π (1+g) and the real growth contribution as -g.
7/ The exchange rate contribution is derived from the numerator in footnote 5 as ae(1+r).
8/ Includes asset changes and interest revenues (if any). For projections, includes exchange rate changes during the projection period.
9/ Assumes that key variables (real GDP growth, real interest rate, and other identified debt-creating flows) remain at the level of the last projection year.

Exchange Rate Arrangement. Costa Rica’s de jure exchange rate arrangement is classified as a
“crawling band,” while the de facto exchange rate arrangement is classified as “stabilized.” Since
October 2006, the de jure exchange rate arrangement has been a crawling band with an increasing
width. The ceiling and floor of the band have been adjusted several times, most recently in
January 2009, when the crawl rate of the band’s ceiling has been set at 0.20 colones (previously 0.06
colones) a business day. The floor of the band has been flat since July 2008. As of December 3, 2014,
the intervention buying and selling exchange rates were 500 and 858.25 colones per U.S. dollar

PAST FUND STAFF RECOMMENDATIONS AND
IMPLEMENTATION
2012 Article IV Staff Recommendation

Implementation
Fiscal Policy



Rebuild fiscal buffers that were used to contain
the impact of the global crisis. Moreover, fiscal
consolidation is needed to safeguard fiscal
sustainability over the medium and long term.



The consolidation strategy should center on both
revenue enhancing measures and expenditure
restraint. An early fiscal correction of about 1-1½
percent of GDP would be appropriate, with
greater consolidation necessary into the medium
term.



Containment of public spending was short lived,
with primary expenditures and debt rising again in
2012–13. Efforts to restrain outlays, mainly
through capital expenditure cuts in 2011, were
undermined by larger transfers and interest costs
in 2012–13. As a result, both the central
government deficit and public debt increased in
relation to GDP.

Monetary and Foreign Exchange Policy



Continued adherence to the exchange rate band
system may imperil the low inflation achieved in
recent years, in light of the strong appreciating
pressures exacerbated by the large capital
inflows.



To protect macroeconomic stability, the
authorities should phase out the exchange rate
band and establish the inflation target as the sole
nominal anchor of the economy. Foreign
exchange market interventions by the central
bank to smooth out exchange rate fluctuations
and strengthen the NIR position would still be
possible insofar as these do not undermine the
inflation target.



Private capital inflows and government external
bond issuance kept the XR at the bottom of the
band in 2012–13, with strong reserve
accumulation. However, the colón lost 8 percent
of its value in 2014 as private inflows dried up and
domestic residents adjusted their portfolios
toward FX assets. The central bank intervened to
reduce volatility and the XR has stabilized.



After ending 2013 at 3.7 percent, inflation climbed
to 5.5 percent—above the 3-5 percent central
bank target range—in August 2014. This reflected
mainly pass-through to domestic prices from the
exchange rate depreciation. To contain secondround effects from devaluation, the authorities
raised the monetary policy rate twice this year.



The authorities are considering a move to a more
flexible exchange rate system, although the band
system is still in place, and are intervening in the
foreign exchange market by following an
undisclosed rule.

Financial Sector

4



Implementation of the 2008 FSAP
recommendations should be accelerated.



The authorities should strive to introduce riskbased supervision. Existing capital quality should
be firmed up and liquidity and capital
requirements increased in line with Basel III
standards.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND



Progress on introducing FSAP recommendations
has been mixed. Critical legislation to enhance
consolidated supervision and strengthen bank
resolution remains to be approved.



Measures have been enacted to move towards full
implementation of risk-based supervision.

RELATIONS WITH THE WORLD BANK AND BANKFUND COLLABORATION UNDER THE JOINT
MANAGEMENT ACTION PLAN (JMAP)
1.

In November 2014, the IMF’s Costa Rica team led by Mr. Figliuoli (mission chief) met
with the World Bank’s Costa Rica team led by Mr. Calvo-Gonzalez (lead economist and PREM
sector leader) to discuss macroeconomic challenges, identify macro-critical structural reforms,
and coordinate the two teams’ work.
2.
The teams agreed that Costa Rica’s main macroeconomic challenges are to safeguard
fiscal sustainability, increase the effectiveness of monetary policy, maintain financial sector
stability and enhance competitiveness.
3.
The teams also discussed potential strategies to foster inclusive growth in the context
of growing inequality.
4.
Based on the shared assessment of macroeconomic challenges, the teams identified
four structural reform areas as macro-critical:


Fiscal consolidation. The fiscal consolidation strategy should comprise both revenue and
expenditure components, with a slant towards revenue enhancement. The adjustment plan
laid out by the authorities is appropriate, though critical elements need further elaboration.
Key elements for a successful adjustment plan include broadening the base for the VAT,
increasing VAT rates, raising marginal tax rates on high earners and containing growth of the
public sector wage bill.



Monetary policy framework. The transition to inflation targeting and greater exchange rate
flexibility should be accelerated in order to lock in low inflation achieved in recently years.



Financial sector stability. Progress has been made in adopting risk-based financial
supervision. Looking ahead, approval of legislation on consolidated supervision, deposit
insurance and banking resolution will be critical to bring the regulatory framework up to
international best practices.



Productivity. The country is making progress in addressing issues of universal coverage and
quality in secondary education, and is seeking to develop its scientific and technological
capabilities, which would help maintain Costa Rica’s growth of knowledge-intensive exports.
There is also strong commitment to improving the business environment and removing
burdensome red tape. Given the sizable investments required to upgrade infrastructure and
the tight fiscal situation, the government is seeking to create the institutional conditions to
engage the private sector in financing, construction and management of infrastructure

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

COSTA RICA

projects (public-private partnerships), though these will require vigilance to avoid undue
contingent liabilities.
5.

The teams agreed the following division of labor:



Fiscal consolidation. The IMF (the Fund) will continue to provide policy recommendations on
macro-fiscal issues, including the overall strategy of fiscal consolidation and the tax reform.
The World Bank (the Bank) will provide technical assistance to support the use of publicprivate partnerships as a vehicle to finance key infrastructure projects. The government also
requested assistance to improve financial management, service delivery, and sustainability of
its social security system.



Monetary policy framework. The Fund will continue to provide policy recommendations
regarding the transition to inflation targeting and a more flexible exchange rate regime.



Financial sector stability. The Bank and the Fund will cooperate as necessary in assisting the
country in implementing the FSAP recommendations.



Productivity. The Bank will continue to provide policy recommendations in key areas. In
terms of lending, the government is being supported by a project in higher education
(approved in September 2012) and a catastrophe draw down deferred option (approved in
March 2009). The government has also requested technical assistance from IFC Advisory
services to improve the investment climate.

6.

The teams have the following requests for information from their counterparts:



The Fund team requests to be kept informed of progress in the above macro-critical
structural reform areas. Timing: when milestones are reached (and at least semi-annually).



The Bank team requests to be kept informed of the Fund’s assessments of macroeconomic
policies and prospects. Timing: when milestones are reached (and at least semi-annually).

Recent activities. The IBD´s loan portfolio in Costa Rica has 11 sovereign guaranteed
operations in execution, with an approved amount of US$1,360.7 million. The available amount for
disbursements is US$1,069.8 million (80.1% of the approved), and is concentrated in the areas of
Energy (32.5%), Transportation (26.3%), Education (15.6%) and Reform and Modernization of the
State (12.9 %). The average age of the operations is 4 years. The IDB still has three operations
pending legislative ratification: Water and Sanitation Program, an Innovation and Human Capital for
Competitiveness Program and an Education Infrastructure Construction and Equipment Program.
Disbursements of sovereign guaranteed operations during 2012 are expected to reach around
US$94.2 million, concentrated in the areas of Energy (69.7%), Reform and Modernization of the State
(15.0%) and Transportation (12.8%).
2.
Future plans. During the 2013 the IDB expects to continue the implementation of its
2011–2014 Country Strategy for Costa Rica, focused on the areas of Transportation, Energy, Citizen
Security, Early Childhood Development, Health and Innovation. In 2013 the IDB expects to approve
two Sovereign Guarantee loans for a total amount of US$338.0 million on Transportation and
Logistics/Regional Integration.

STATISTICAL ISSUES
(As of December, 2014)

General: Data provision is broadly adequate for surveillance. The quality of macroeconomic data
has continued to improve in recent years. This was confirmed by a reassessment of the Data Module
Report on the Observance of Standards and Codes (ROSC) that was published in February 2010.
Further statistical improvements are being pursued, including in the real, monetary, fiscal and
balance of payments sectors. The Central Bank, the Ministry of Finance, and the National Institute of
Statistics and Census make data available to the public through regular official publications on their
websites (www.bccr.fi.cr, www.hacienda.go.cr, and www.inec.go.cr).
National accounts: National accounts are compiled generally in accordance with the System of
National Accounts 1993 (SNA 1993). However, the reference year 1991 for the series at constant
prices is outdated, an issue of significant recent importance for estimating the effect of the Intel
withdrawal on estimates of real GDP. Estimation of rentals for owner occupied dwellings should be
improved. Accounting depreciation is used instead of estimating consumption of fixed capital.
Double deflation method is not applied. Changes in inventories are obtained as residuals and the
Chow Lin (without indicator) method is applied for benchmarking quarterly value added of activities,
comprising a third of GDP. Non-observed/informal activities are not properly covered. The Central
Bank is currently in the process of changing the base year to 2012 and implementing the
recommendations of the System of National Accounts 2008 (2008 SNA) that are relevant for the
Costa Rican economy. The project is scheduled for completion by December, 2015.
Price statistics: The compilation of the consumer price index (CPI), in general, employs concepts
and definitions from the 1993 SNA and the international CPI manual. However, the CPI lacks a
market basket component to measure the cost of owner-occupied housing. Also, the index only
covers urban households located in greater San Jose, which comprise approximately 46 percent of
the total population and 72 percent of the urban population of Costa Rica. Individual price index
data are not generally verified against similar data from other databases such as the producer price
index (PPI) and agricultural price indices. Nevertheless, atypical movements in the data are
investigated and corrected when necessary.
Except for being compiled only by product aggregations and not by economic activity as well, the
PPI is compiled based on concepts and definitions from the 1993 SNA and the international PPI
Manual. However, the weights, the establishment sample, and the product sample for the PPI that
were introduced in 2000 are based on 1997 sales data. Therefore, the index needs updating. A
comprehensive assessment of the source data is being carried out, and this is guiding the
production of new source data to update the PPI and the national accounts. The export and import
and import price indices as well as the PPI are currently being updated.
Government finance statistics: The concepts and definitions used in compiling GFS generally
follow the guidelines of the GFSM 1986. However, financing data and government debt, which use
national concepts that combine instruments and holders, are not in accordance with international
10

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

COSTA RICA

standards. A migration path to the GFSM 2001 has been adopted in the context of the GFS
harmonization project for Central America, Panama, and the Dominican Republic. Monthly fiscal
statistics are only compiled and disseminated for budgetary central government, while annual
statistics are compiled and disseminated for the entire public sector and its subsectors. The place of
issue (Costa Rica or abroad) criterion is followed to classify domestic and foreign debt, instead of
the internationally recommended residency criterion. Fiscal data discrepancies among national
compilers on particular items are not regularly reconciled, although large fluctuations or
discrepancies are investigated. Fiscal statistics are not regularly reconciled with monetary statistics,
or other macroeconomic statistics.
Monetary Statistics: Costa Rica’s monetary statistics are broadly in line with the methodology of
the MFSM. Classification/sectorization follows the MFSM with some exceptions. The social security
system accounts are not presented within the central government, but aggregated with other public
sector accounts. Some financial assets and liabilities are not disaggregated by economic sector.
Accrued interest is not classified together with its underlying instrument.
Balance of Payments: The balance of payments statistics broadly follow the concepts and
definitions in the BPM5. While generally adequate and derived from sound collection programs,
source data are incomplete to compile some services in the current account, financial transactions of
the nonfinancial private sector, and remuneration of employees. Foreign direct investment
transactions and positions are valued on a cash basis instead of the recommended accrual basis.
Services are recorded at the time the service is provided. While other income transactions are
recorded on an accrual basis, interest on public external debt is recorded on the due date; no
adjustment is made to convert interest to accrued values. Transfer prices in some cases are not
converted to market prices.
Data Standards and Quality: Costa Rica is in observance with the Special Data Dissemination
Standards (SDDS). Data Module Report on the Observance of Standards and Codes (ROSC) was
published in February 2010.

Costa Rica: Table of Common Indicators Required for Surveillance

Statement by the Staff Representative on Costa Rica
Executive Board Meeting
January 30, 2014

1.
This statement provides additional information that has become available since
the staff report was issued. It does not alter the thrust of the staff appraisal.
2.
Headline economic indicators remain broadly in line with the baseline scenario
in the staff report.


Economic activity slowed down in late 2014, especially in the free trade zone—
reflecting faster than expected winding-down of operations at the Intel assembly
plant—and in the agriculture sector owing to weather factors. As a result, GDP
growth for 2014 as a whole is now estimated at 3.5 percent, marginally lower than the
3.6 percent in the staff report. On the other hand, GDP in 2015 is now projected to
expand somewhat faster (3.7 percent) than in the staff report reflecting both lower
international oil prices and higher U.S. growth projections.1



End-2014 inflation was lower than projected—5.1 versus 5.6 percent—mainly the
effect of lower oil prices. Second round effects from lower oil prices should bring
inflation closer to the center of the 3–5 percent target band earlier than expected in
the staff report. End-2015 inflation is currently anticipated at 4.4 percent (versus
4.5 percent), with significant potential for further downward revisions



The decline in international reserves over 2014 was lower than anticipated—about
US$0.1 bn, versus expected US$0.5 bn—as the central bank stepped up FX purchases
in the latter part of the year in response to stronger demand for colones. The exchange
rate has remained stable at around 540 colones per dollar. The current account deficit
for 2015 is now expected to be significantly lower than in the staff report after recent
downward revisions in international oil price projections. However, staff’s
assessment that the external position is adequate remains unchanged.

3.
The authorities have publicly reiterated their commitment to fiscal adjustment
in line with Fund advice. A VAT law aimed at broadening the tax base to include the
services sector and at gradually raising the tax rate from 13 to 15 percent has been drafted by
the Ministry of Finance and is expected to be submitted to Congress shortly, together with
the reform of the income tax law. The minister of finance has also publicly committed to
other adjustment measures, including base public salary increases below inflation and cuts in
transfers.

The WEO oil price forecast has been revised from US$73.4 per barrel to US$56.7 per barrel for 2015.

Press Release No. 15/32
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
February 4, 2015

International Monetary Fund
700 19th Street, NW
Washington, D. C. 20431 USA

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2014 Article IV Consultation with Costa Rica
January 30, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded the Article
IV consultation1 with Costa Rica.
Costa Rica bounced back quickly from the 2008–09 global crisis, but growth momentum is now
slowing and macro vulnerabilities, mainly from the weak fiscal position, are rising. After falling
modestly in 2009, real GDP surged in 2010–12. Since then, however, growth has moderated
below potential, with the latter also on a declining trend. The counter-cyclical budgetary stimulus
imparted in 2009 pushed the deficit above 5 percent of GDP in 2010 (mainly through a rise in
wages and transfers). The deficit has been creeping up further since then, placing the publicdebt-to-GDP ratio on an unsustainable upward trajectory, which is fast approaching levels shown
to increase risks of disorderly adjustment for emerging economies. A fairly inflexible exchange
rate has contributed to vulnerabilities associated with dollarization in the financial sector.
The outlook for 2015 and beyond remains subdued amid deteriorating fundamentals. Growth in
2015 is expected to stay virtually unchanged, as the positive influence of U.S. recovery offsets
the negative impact of a gradual Intel withdrawal. The output gap is projected to widen through
2016, then mostly closing over the medium term, with growth also converging to potential. The
baseline scenario contemplates fiscal consolidation of 2.2percent of GDP over the medium term.
In this case, the central government fiscal deficit would stay at about 5.75 percent of GDP, and
the public debt ratio would approach 51 percent of GDP by 2019. Thanks to continued prudent
monetary policy, inflation is projected to hover around 4 percent after returning within the
Central Bank’s announced band in early 2015, while the current account deficit rises to
5.25percent of GDP by 2019.
Risks to the outlook are tilted to the downside. Concerning external factors, in the case of faster
U.S. monetary policy normalization, slightly upside risks prevail, with a positive impact of

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with members, usually
every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial information, and discusses with officials
the country's economic developments and policies. On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which
forms the basis for discussion by the Executive Board.

higher U.S. growth more than offsetting the negative influence of tighter global financial
conditions in the short run. However, extreme bouts of market volatility could inflict serious
damage, especially given Costa Rica’s weak fiscal position, as interest rates may rise abruptly.
On the other hand, further sustained declines in energy prices could have a modest positive effect
on Costa Rica. On the domestic side, the persistence of a large fiscal deficit and the ensuing rise
in the public debt ratio could render the economy vulnerable to sudden changes in financial
market conditions.
Executive Board Assessment
While commending Costa Rica’s resilience in the aftermath of the global financial crisis,
Executive Directors called for reinvigorated efforts to preserve macroeconomic stability in the
wake of waning growth and rising unemployment and vulnerabilities. They recommended an
ambitious but phased budget consolidation to arrest the deterioration in the fiscal accounts and
put the public debt on a sustainable trajectory, along with a strengthening of the monetary policy
framework and structural reforms to boost competitiveness and inclusive growth.
Directors welcomed the authorities’ intention to implement a total fiscal adjustment of about 4
percent of GDP, with a front-loaded adjustment in 2015 followed by more incremental steps in
subsequent years. Noting Costa Rica’s low revenue effort relative to peer countries, they
supported the emphasis on boosting revenue mobilization through a mix of administrative and
policy reforms—including broadening the tax base, and raising the VAT rate and marginal rates
on higher-income brackets. Directors also encouraged efforts to contain the growth of current
outlays, particularly the wage bill and transfers, thus creating space for much-needed
infrastructure spending. They looked forward to Parliamentary approval of outstanding
legislative reforms and encouraged consensus building for a comprehensive package of measures
to underpin deficit reduction. Over the longer run, measures are also needed to address the social
security actuarial deficit.
Directors considered the current monetary policy stance to be appropriate, while calling on the
Banco Central de Costa Rica (BCCR) to stand ready to increase its policy rate should
inflationary pressure persist. They recommended strengthening the monetary policy framework,
including further steps towards inflation targeting and enhanced exchange rate flexibility. In this
regard, most Directors supported the elimination of the exchange rate band. Directors also
recommended the development of tools to underpin greater exchange rate flexibility, including
hedging instruments.
Directors encouraged implementation of pending FSAP recommendations, to help strengthen
financial sector supervision and resilience. They advised a gradual move towards Basel III
standards, and strengthening cross-border supervision. Priority should also be given to
empowering the Financial Institutions Superintendence to conduct consolidated and transnational

3
supervision, providing adequate protection to supervisors, and enhancing bank resolution
procedures.
Directors called for continued progress in structural reforms to boost productivity, enhance
external competitiveness, and foster long-run inclusive growth. Efforts are needed to streamline
the regulatory environment, increase private sector participation in the energy sector, alleviate
infrastructure bottlenecks, and promote capital market development. Directors also
recommended ameliorating the efficiency of education spending, with a view to increasing
women’s labor force participation, stimulating productivity, and reducing inequality in the long
term.

Statement by Mr. Jimenez Latorre and Mr. Pacheco on Costa Rica
Executive Board Meeting
January 27, 2015

The Costa Rican authorities thank staff for a very constructive dialogue during the Article IV
consultation and concur with the report´s main findings and recommendations.
A new government took office last May after a second round presidential election, marking a
first time win for the Citizens’ Action Party. The government plans to boost economic
growth and reduce unemployment by addressing infrastructure bottlenecks, supporting SME,
fighting red tape and other reforms. The authorities´ agenda also contemplates reduction of
poverty and income inequality, both high for the country’s standards. Since its inception the
government has been dealing with a high fiscal deficit and has put in place many measures to
tackle it.
Recent Developments
Thanks to the authorities´ efforts the fiscal deficit, previously projected at 6.3 percent of
GDP, closed 2014 at 5.6 percent. Upon enactment of a decree to freeze 85 percent of
vacancies in July 2014 and other measures, the government has managed to reduce the
growth of spending from 14 percent in 2013 to 9.3 percent in 2014. Moreover, as capital
spending grew at 16 percent, the burden of the adjustment fell on current spending that grew
at 8.71 percent compare with 13.4 percent in 2013.
As stated in the report, authorities and staff concur on the size, pace and composition of the
fiscal adjustment. The Finance Minister has presented a 3.8 percent of GDP fiscal
consolidation plan that includes reform of current taxes, rates2 and spending measures, as
well as a freeze on real salaries.

This is the lowest current spending growth rate in 6 years.

Gradually from 2016 onwards.

The macroeconomic context is positive. Inflation, at 5.1 percent, closed near its target range
even after a considerable depreciation during the first semester. Growth would be only
partially affected by the proposed fiscal consolidation and is expected to return to potential in
the medium term. Stronger growth in the U.S., Cost Rica’s main trade partner, and prolonged
lower oil prices would improve growth prospects.
Despite the closure of Intel manufacturing plant, external accounts are healthy and FDI
remains high. Reserves are within IMF adequacy metric.
Fiscal Policy
Revenues
Tax avoidance and tax evasion accounted for 7.75 percent of GDP3 while exemptions
account for 6 percent of GDP. Together they exceed the current tax revenue. Since May
2014, the government has put in place a number of administrative initiatives to fight tax
evasion and tax avoidance, one of the most relevant being the obligation by every firm to
withhold 2 percent of each sale as a corporate income tax presumption4. The electronic
invoice is expected to become mandatory this year and will join the set of tools to fight
evasion.
These measures are being complemented by two law initiatives already under congress
review, the anti-tax evasion law and the anti-smuggling law5. While the former strengthens
tax controls and enforces collection, the latter fights smuggling by overhauling the legal
framework and increasing sanctions and penalties.
The authorities are aware that all these measures account for a small portion of the needed
fiscal consolidation. The broad part of the adjustment is expected to come from the reform to
the VAT and income tax. In the current VAT setup, services, the most dynamic sector of the
economy, are exempted. The reform will include them into the taxable base exempting basic
goods6, education and health services.
In the case of income tax, the government is working to change the current schedular system
for a global determination of the tax liability. At the time of the Article IV mission in
November, the VAT reform and the income tax reform were to be sent for Congress approval

This measure was initially appealed in the administrative court but it has been recently affirmed.

These law initiatives were sent to congress in July and November 2014 respectively.

In the case of basic goods the authorities plan to eliminate the exoneration as soon as the subsidy system
works. They will subsidize the first 3 deciles.

in December 2014 and February 2015, respectively. However, to compensate some of the
regressive effects of the VAT reform some members of Congress opted to approve both
reforms together. This makes March the new date to present both initiatives.
During the first semester of 2015, the authorities plan to present another exemptions related
reform. It will streamline the current setup, incorporate sanctions and regulate the creation of
exemptions, for instance by setting an expiration date.
Expenditure and Financing
On the expenditure side, the government cut the 2015 budget in 0.4 percent of GDP and will
maintain the partial hiring freeze. Salaries are going to be frozen in real terms. Those are
tangible actions that will impact the 2015 expenditure invoice. A number of law initiatives
will be also sent to congress during 2015 and will have a permanent effect on the fiscal
accounts, such as a cap on pensions paid out of the budget and a strengthening of the system,
a cap on high salaries and the public employment law.
While fiscal measures begin to yield, the government will use external financing in order to
avoid crowding out domestic market and pressure interest rates. It is expected to place one
billion dollars in international markets during 2015 and contingent credit lines with World
Bank and IADB for 2016 are being negotiated.
Monetary and Exchange Rate Policy
Inflation ended 2014 close to the target range despite an important depreciation of the Colon
during the first semester. The authorities agree with the importance of allowing for more XR
flexibility and concur that the elimination of the band could be the next step. However, we
would like to provide more details regarding the FX market in Costa Rica and the Central
Bank´s (BCCR) rational behind maintaining veiled some aspects of the intervention rule. As
the report states, the main objective of the rules is to avoid excessive short-term fluctuations
without interfering with the medium-term trends. BCCR intervention is framed into a robust
set of regulations approved by the Board of Directors and a special committee7. Daily when
market closes BCCR publishes the balance negotiated in the market as well as the amount of
the intervention, if any. The intervention trigger, the amounts allowed and other elements
were approved by the Board based on technical advice. BCCR´s staff is in charge of the
execution with no discretion allowed and under the constant scrutiny of the audit department.
The BCCR’s Board of directors has decided to maintain specific intervention criteria private
since Costa Rica FX market is small and dominated by few banks, thus disclosure of those
specific details would facilitate speculation against small agents. The system works in a very
transparent way.

The Financial Stability Committee is formed by the central bank´s president, manager and relevant directors.

Financial system
The financial system is sound and as the report recognizes “…only a few banks are not yet in
full compliance with Basel III standards…” The pending reforms have been delayed by an
overwhelming fiscal and trade agenda in congress over the last years. Notwithstanding, the
authorities have requested the IMF for TA on conglomerate supervision in order to expedite
the reform process.
Structural reforms
We concur competitiveness needs to be improved. The country ranks 51th (third in LatinAmerican region) in the Global Competitiveness Index 2014-2015. Infrastructure
bottlenecks, excessive regulatory environment, ease of doing business and concerns on the
efficiency and efficacy of education spending are among the diagnosed problems being
addressed by the authorities. The government has secured more than USD 1.5 billion coming
from multilateral and bilateral sources to overhaul road infrastructure and a comprehensive
strategy has been put into place to launch execution. The environmental agency has just
granted final approval to begin the construction of a USD 1 billion mega-port in the
Caribbean coast by APM Terminals8.
With regard to electricity tariffs, they are relatively well-positioned against different
benchmarks, more so taking into account that 80 percent of the electricity comes from
renewable sources.
The recent withdrawal of Intel, more than signaling competitiveness problems in Costa Rica,
was the result of changes in the personal computers global market. Due to this fact the
company is closing or downsizing microprocessor chip manufacturing lines, also in other
markets. But it is not exiting the country; an important division of R&D is going to be
upgraded.
Thanks to its well- educated work force, the country continues attracting foreign corporations
from the technology and services sectors. In fact, FDI was in line with the authorities’
projection, totaling USD 2.2 billion in 2014. The medical sector, mainly manufacturing
technological devices, is booming with 63 firms already operating and new investments in
the pipeline. This technology industry is less sensitive to economic downturns than other
sectors.
With regard to trade integration, Costa Rica began the process of joining the Pacific Alliance9
on February 10, 2014. This bloc not only will boost trade among members but also may serve
