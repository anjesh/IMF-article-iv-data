-3I. CONTEXT AND KEY ISSUES
1.
Amid a favorable external environment, the economic recovery that began in 2003
has continued, Mexico has extended its record of macroeconomic and financial stability,
and inflation has fallen to historic lows. At the same time, important structural challenges
remain—to accelerate growth and poverty reduction, and to address medium-term fiscal issues
centered on oil revenue reliance.
2.
Recent Article IV consultations with Mexico have emphasized consolidation of the
public finances in a favorable external environment, the development and implementation
of the inflation targeting framework, and the structural reform agenda. In broad terms, staff
agreed with the authorities on the direction of their policies and objectives. On fiscal policy, the
staff supported the authorities on the need for tax reform, and highlighted the need for an
efficient and cautious approach to managing oil income and wealth. The authorities have used
part of their oil windfall for deficit reduction, and recently a fiscal responsibility law was passed.
Monetary policy has brought inflation to the low single digits, and the authorities have
significantly enhanced monetary policy transparency and communication. On the structural
policy front, the staff supported the authorities’ agenda, but implementation was often frustrated
by lack of political consensus.
3.
Good short-term prospects and a still-favorable external environment allowed the
discussions to focus on structural issues and medium-term challenges. The discussions also
built on the findings of this year’s FSAP Update, and focused especially in three areas:
•

Financial markets: progress since the 2001 FSAP, in terms of both stability and
efficiency; and the remaining financial reform agenda.

•

Fiscal policy: the need to address underlying vulnerabilities and to counter pressures that
will mount over the medium term, including in light of uncertainty concerning future
levels of government oil income.

•

Growth, reforms, and competitiveness: the challenges in raising productivity,
competitiveness and growth (Selected Issues Chapter I).

4.
The Article IV discussions took place ahead of the July 2 elections, the results of
which are under legal challenge. After the electoral institute announced that Mr. Calderon
(PAN) narrowly edged Mr. Lopez Obrador (PRD) in the presidential race, the PRD began a legal
challenge, on which the electoral court will rule by early September at the latest. The elections
yielded a congress divided among the three main parties, with the PAN having the greatest
representation, followed by the PRD.

-4II. RECENT DEVELOPMENTS
5.
After a slowdown early last year, growth recovered in the second half of 2005 and
early 2006 (Figure 1). Growth in 2005 slowed to 3.0 percent, but is estimated to have rebounded
to almost 5 percent in January–May 2006. Domestic demand grew somewhat faster than output,
as private consumption and private investment were both strong. Manufacturing has accelerated
this year, related to stronger U.S. industrial production and a rebound of auto exports.
Employment grew by more than 5 percent in 2005, and formal employment finally surpassed
its 2000 level.
6.
Bank credit continues to grow strongly, from a very low base. A favorable
macroeconomic environment, stronger bank balance sheets, better credit information, and
mortgage insurance provided by a specialized development bank boosted consumer and housing
bank credit in 2005 and so far in 2006. Credit to enterprises also has grown, but at a slower pace.
7.
Inflation, after an extended period above target, converged to the 3 percent target1
in late 2005 (Figure 2). Subsequently, when headline inflation moved up in early 2006—mainly
reflecting volatile food prices—core inflation remained steady and the headline rate came
quickly back down.
8.
Amid declining inflation and inflation expectations, the Bank of Mexico (BoM) in
August 2005 began to unwind its earlier monetary tightening, before stopping in
April 2006. The overnight bank rate—for which the BoM targets a minimum level—was
reduced from a peak of 9¾ percent to 7 percent in April, when the BoM ruled out additional
easing “in the foreseeable future.”2

1

While the BoM has established a 2–4 percent inflation variability range, the authorities have
emphasized that the inflation target is 3.0 percent.
2

The BoM has not changed the corto, its traditional policy instrument, since March 2005, but maintains it
as an available tool.

The BoM has adhered strictly to its policy of avoiding discretionary purchases or
sales of foreign exchange (Box 1). Still, NIR has trended upward, as the BoM receives the
foreign exchange cash surplus generated by the public sector—including the state oil company,
PEMEX. The pace of such accumulation has been moderated by the rule for selling a fixed share
of this surplus. NIR reached US$68.6 billion at end 2005, about 4½ months of imports and
1.6 times short-term external liabilities, and rose further to US$76.7 billion in July 2006.
10.
With financial markets continuing to show confidence in Mexico, prices of Mexican
assets have tended to move broadly in line with external markets (Figure 3). Movements in
the sovereign spread have tracked other emerging market spreads, with the level well below the
EMBI index and at one point crossing briefly below 100 bp. The stock market, after doubling
during 2004–05, hit a new peak in early May, but then followed other emerging markets
downward, through mid-June. Mexico was not among the group of emerging markets hit hardest
during the May-June global selloff, although this occurred amid pre-election uncertainty.

The peso, after generally appreciating since early 2004, reversed course in
March 2006. The initial depreciation was associated with a marked rise in U.S. long-term
interest rates. In May, the peso weakened further, amid the global selloff of emerging market
assets, and almost returned to its April 2004 low. Subsequently, announcement of the July 2
election results triggered a sharp appreciation (and stock market gain, as well as a drop in the
sovereign spread).

-8-

Box 1. Operation of the Exchange Rate Regime
The value of the Mexican peso is
continuously market-determined, in the
absence of discretionary foreign exchange
purchases or sales by the central bank. At
the same time, BoM accumulates NIR from:
(i) interest earned on its reserves; and (ii) its
role as foreign exchange conversion agent for
the government and PEMEX, which together
generate a net foreign exchange cash surplus.
Rising oil export prices since 2002 have
boosted this foreign exchange surplus and
NIR accumulation. In March 2003, the
authorities began to sell foreign exchange to
the market, introducing a rule in which half
of each quarter’s NIR accumulation is
subsequently sold, in equal-sized daily
auctions.1 This rule has been respected since
its inception, irrespective of exchange rate
developments.
Under this rule, NIR grew at an average
annual rate of about US$7 billion in
2003–2005, while BoM auctions of foreign
exchange averaged about US$5 billion. The
ratios of NIR to imports, and to GDP, were
broadly stable in 2004–05.

Under this policy regime, the variability of
the peso has been similar to that of other flexible exchange rates. For example, from March 2003
to June 2006, the variation of the peso/dollar exchange rate (measured by the standard deviation of
daily, weekly, or monthly changes) was broadly comparable to that of the exchange rates of the
Canadian dollar and Euro. During this period, short-run fluctuations in the Mexican exchange rate
were significantly correlated with movements in emerging market bond spreads (declines in the
EMBI+ index were associated with appreciation of the peso). Shifts in world oil prices may also have
influenced the peso in this period, but the statistical evidence for this relationship is much weaker.
Statistically, it is not possible to discern any link from the BoM’s daily foreign exchange sales to
movements in the peso (as would be expected, given the very smooth rate of foreign exchange
sales).2
1.

The BoM sells by auction half of the NIR accumulation that would have been registered over the quarter were it
not for the foreign exchange sold under the rule. When the rule was adopted in March 2003, half of each quarter’s
accumulation was sold into the market over the next quarter. In March 2004, the rule was modified to sell the same
amount over the next four quarters, reducing quarterly fluctuations in foreign exchange sales.

2.

BoM foreign exchange sales are small in relation to the turnover in the peso-dollar market. End-2004 figures
indicate a daily turnover (spot and forward) of US$15 billion, more than a thousand times the BoM’s daily foreign
exchange sales.

The fiscal accounts showed a further consolidation in 2005, helped by a modest
rise in oil revenues and a better-than-expected balance of the development banks
(Figure 4). Although oil export prices were up sharply, net oil revenues rose by just
0.4 percent of GDP, reflecting a weak production outturn,3 as well as structural factors (see
below). This modest gain helped narrow the augmented deficit, to 1.4 percent of GDP. The
non-oil deficit narrowed slightly, to 7.2 percent of GDP. Although current expenditure turned
up in 2005, this was offset by better non-oil revenue performance and negative net lending by
the development banks, reflecting their sale of loans.4 In terms of the traditional budget
measure, the government again met its target, as the traditional deficit fell to 0.1 percent of
GDP.

The fiscal windfall from rising world energy prices has remained relatively
modest. Hydrocarbon production in Mexico is much smaller in relation to the size of the
economy than in other oil exporting countries. Another factor is that Mexico’s hydrocarbon
import bill—roughly half as large as its hydrocarbon export receipts—has also been pushed

In 2005, oil production stagnated and oil export volume actually declined.

In the staff’s presentation of the augmented fiscal accounts, net lending by the development banks
counts as expenditure and adds to the augmented deficit; loan recovery, and the sale of loans, counts
as negative expenditure and reduces the augmented deficit.

significantly limited by the longstanding practice of holding domestic gasoline prices
constant in real terms.5 Staff estimates that if such fuel prices had tracked world prices

Proven reserves of oil declined again in 2005. As in recent years, oil was pumped
out much faster than “new” oil was added to proven reserves, which are now down to about
11 years’ production (Box 2).
15.
The external position has continued to improve, helped by favorable external
conditions that stayed ahead of the effect of rising domestic demand on imports
(Figure 5). Although imports grew strongly, rising remittances (Selected Issues Chapter II)
and oil exports reduced the current account deficit to less than 1 percent of GDP in 2005, and
in the first quarter of 2006 the current account moved into surplus. Non-oil exports
performed well overall, with a rebound in the maquila sector. Mexico’s share in its main
export market, the U.S., stabilized in 2005, after three years of decline. Foreign direct
investment more than matched the current account deficit in 2005. Within the capital
account, the public sector significantly reduced its external borrowing, while net borrowing
of the corporate sector turned positive for the first time in several years.
16.
The public debt ratio declined further in 2005, with gross public debt just under
45 percent of GDP. External debt fell to about 13 percent of GDP. If the central bank’s
international reserves were taken into account, net external public debt would be less than
5 percent of GDP. Of the domestically-issued debt, foreigners held about US$12 billion at
mid-2006 (about 1½ percent of GDP).

Other than gasoline and diesel prices, most energy prices in Mexico are adjusted in response to
movements in world prices.

6

Considered in relation to U.S. gasoline prices, Mexican gasoline pump prices have moved from a
situation of significant taxation in 2002 to a modest subsidy this year.

Box 2. Sustainability Issues in the Oil Sector
Oil revenues are key to the medium-term outlook for the public finances. Although oil plays

of the public finances.
The sustainability of PEMEX production is a potential concern. In recent years, oil
production has grown little. Moreover, proven oil reserves have declined steadily from about
17 billion barrels in 2002 to 14 billion barrels in 2005. The ratio of proven reserves to annual
production fell from about 15 years in 2002 to 11 years in 2005 (the measure of proven plus
probable reserves declined similarly, from the equivalent of about 26½ years of production to
about 21½ years.)
Future oil output will depend largely on PEMEX’s success in developing and exploiting
new oil fields. Oil production from the “supergiant” Cantarell field—which currently accounts
for about 60 percent of total output—is projected by PEMEX to fall by almost 50 percent
by 2010. Finding adequate replacements for this relatively accessible field will be a challenge.
PEMEX expects that declining Cantarell output can be more than compensated over the next few
years by developing existing fields (particularly the KMZ field) and exploring new oil sources.
However, oil production forecasts, particularly for new fields, are subject to great uncertainty,
and analysts do not rule out the possibility that total production could begin to decline in the next
few years.
Significant investment expenditure
and new technology will be required
to exploit geologically challenging
terrain and deep-sea sources.
Already, PEMEX investment has
recently climbed to over US$10 billion
annually, from less than US$1 billion
in the 1990s. Although foreign
technology is often acquired through
equity participation by other oil majors
in new projects, this is prohibited by
Mexico’s constitution.

Debt management emphasized improvement in maturity as well as a shift away
from external debt. The government conducted a number of liability management
operations aimed at reducing the share of external debt, creating liquid benchmark bonds in
the international market, and diversifying the investor base. The authorities have announced
that the federal government has no foreign financing need for the rest of 2006; in June, the
government announced that it will pre-pay about US$7 billion of external debt to the World
Bank and Inter-American Development Bank (see later). In the domestic debt market, the
authorities continued to increase the share of fixed rate instruments and increased the average
maturity of central government debt, which rose to almost 40 months in 2005, from
38 months in 2004. In the broader augmented public debt, however, substantial short-term
debt remains, including on the books of IPAB, the deposit protection agency.
18.
Since the 2005 Article IV consultation, a number of significant reforms were
approved by congress and became law. These reforms (discussed later) include: (i) a
budget and fiscal responsibility law; (ii) a strengthened competition law; (iii) a modified
securities market law; and (iv) a bank resolution law.

roughly offset import volume growth. With
the benefit of higher oil export prices, the
already small external current account deficit would nearly disappear in 2006, before
widening slightly in 2007. The authorities’ view was broadly similar, but they noted that
growth could be somewhat higher in both years (subsequently, the BoM raised its 2006
growth projection to a range of 4 to 4½ percent).
20.
Inflation in 2006–07 is expected to remain close to the 3 percent target. The BoM
projects 3 to 3½ percent inflation this year. Staff projections, based on a constant policy
interest rate of 7 percent for the remainder of this year, put inflation at 3.3 percent at end2006 and 3 percent in 2007. Surveys of private expectations are similar for 2006, and around
3.4 percent for 2007.

- 16 -

21.
Staff projects a slight widening of the augmented fiscal deficit in 2006, with a
larger increase in the non-oil deficit. The 2006 budget targets a zero balance on the
traditional measure, but was based on an oil price significantly below current forecasts (and
below the actual 2005 price), and a cut in expenditure (in real terms, relative to the 2005
outcome). This year’s average price will likely exceed the budget’s assumption by almost
50 percent (and the 2005 price by more than 25 percent), while the budget’s adjustors will
require the spending of much of the unbudgeted oil revenue. Relative to the 2005 outcome,
oil revenue this year would rise by almost 1 percent of GDP; with some increase in oilrelated capital expenditure, the oil balance would improve by 0.7 points. On the non-oil
balance, current expenditure would hold about steady on the staff’s projections, but with the
expected resumption of net lending by the development banks and a projected fall back in
non-oil revenue, staff projects that the non-oil augmented deficit would widen somewhat, to
near 8 percent of GDP.
22.
For the near-term outlook, uncertainties include the U.S. economy and a further
tightening of global liquidity conditions. As the U.S. economy moves closer to full
employment, the balance of risks from Mexico’s tight link to the U.S. tilts less to the upside.
Further tightening of global liquidity conditions could act to slow demand and activity,
although Mexico would be less affected than some other emerging markets. Of course any
sign of a major shift in macroeconomic policy discipline would represent a risk, particularly
in light of the still-significant public financing needs. (More specific risk scenarios are
discussed in Section E and Annex V.)
23.
Medium-term prospects depend importantly on Mexico’s ability to implement
structural reforms to address constraints to growth (Section IV, and Selected Issues
Chapter I). In the absence of major new reforms, staff projects that potential output would
grow at about 3½ percent through the medium-term, a bit faster than recent historical
experience. The authorities’ view is similar, in a range of 3½ to 4 percent. Staff and the
authorities agree that a transition to a much faster growth trend would require significant
reforms. Regarding the medium-term fiscal outlook, the main factors will be implementation
of the newly-established budget target (see below) and the continued containment of offbudget flows.
B. Fiscal Policy
24.
The mission welcomed the fiscal consolidation achieved in recent years that had
been key to Mexico’s improved economic position. Declining annual targets for the fiscal
deficit had been consistently met, and the broader augmented fiscal deficit had also been
reduced, inducing a gradually declining trend in the debt ratio. Looking forward,
implementation of the new Budget and Fiscal Responsibility Law would help maintain broad
fiscal discipline (Box 3).
25.

However, several underlying fiscal problems will need to be resolved:

•

Fiscal dependence on oil revenue. Amid low tax revenue, the public finances are
heavily reliant on an oil revenue stream that is uncertain, subject both to oil price risk
and to risk of resource depletion. In the context of relatively low and declining oil
reserves, the non-oil augmented deficit—more than 7 percent of GDP—remains
uncomfortably large.

- 17 -

•

Public debt is still higher than desirable. While the public debt ratio is not unusually
high by international standards, it would be prudent to bring debt down more rapidly,
particularly in light of the above-mentioned oil risks.

•

Spending pressures will rise over the medium term. These include costs of public
employee pensions, access to public health insurance, and infrastructure and
education needs.

•

Limited accountability and control over state government expenditures. State-level
expenditures—supported by federal government transfers—are more important than
in the past, highlighting the need for progress on this front.

26.
The authorities explained the approaches to these issues taken so far, including
the passage of a fiscal responsibility law. Although their tax reform proposals had not
found support in congress, the proposed reform of pensions for public employees is under
discussion in congress. To contain exposure to a decline in oil prices, budgets had been
designed to avoid letting rising oil income translate into inertial expenditure, instead
channeling it into contingent spending, including investment in the oil sector, as well as
deficit reduction. The mechanism for handling oil income in the new Budget and Fiscal
Responsibility Law continues in this direction, although there was some concern that it could
allow a too-rapid increase in expenditure if oil prices rose abruptly. And the authorities noted
that transfers to states would go up further with rising oil prices, making it more important to
improve accountability and control of such expenditure.
27.
On the sustainability of oil income, the authorities explained the need to balance
risks, inside a given legal framework. To counter the prospect of declining production,
PEMEX investment spending had been raised significantly, from a low base. Although the
decline in proven reserves had not yet been arrested, these investments were expected to pay
off with some lag, enough to avoid a decline in production. On the other hand, oil
investments have inherent risks, and concerns about PEMEX governance could add to these.
Unfortunately, a proposal to reform PEMEX governance and allow some risk-sharing with
the private sector had not cleared congress.
28.
The mission agreed that PEMEX governance reform would be a critical step in
ensuring that the oil industry operates most efficiently. Mexico could follow other
countries that have put national oil companies on a more commercial footing. It would also
be important to reconsider the existing constraints on PEMEX financing—in which raising
oil sector investment essentially requires either fiscal policy tightening or the issuance of
public debt—since this may put too much strain on the public sector balance sheet, while
denying PEMEX access to technologies and advantages that other oil companies obtain
through joint ventures.7

- 18 -

Box 3. The New Budget and Fiscal Responsibility Law
This law enacted in March 2006 establishes: (i) an ongoing fiscal balance target;
(ii) mechanisms for budgeting amid oil price uncertainty; and (iii) a medium-term expenditure
framework.
Fiscal target. Future budgets are to aim at a zero balance on the traditional fiscal measure. Under
exceptional circumstances, a weaker budget may be proposed, but this requires explicit justification
and plans for returning to zero balance. (A stronger than required budget also may be proposed.) The
law does not limit the augmented deficit, but does require projection and monitoring of this broader
fiscal measure.
Medium-term implications and debt sustainability. Provided that off-budget flows do not rise above
recent levels, consistent achievement of the targeted zero traditional balance would imply that the
augmented deficit would remain near its recent level of 1½ percent of GDP. Such a stance would be
consistent with a continued gradual reduction of the augmented public debt ratio.
Response to oil price fluctuations and saving of oil revenue. The law calls for a limited amount of
financial saving and dissaving in response to fluctuations in oil prices. Federal oil revenues for each
annual budget will be projected using a reference oil price. This price will be set by a formula based
mainly on oil futures prices (a mix of short-term and medium-term futures), with a one-quarter weight
on the average price of the last 10 years. Any excess income, that results from actual oil prices above
the reference price, may first be used to compensate for certain budgetary overruns (e.g., higher
interest costs, and the higher fuel bill of the state electricity company). The remainder is to be split
between several stabilization funds (90 percent) and state-level investment projects (10 percent).
Once these funds reach ceilings, totaling about 1½ percent of GDP, any subsequent excess is to be
used for investment projects (75 percent) and eventual pension reform costs (25 percent). If the oil
price turns out below its reference level, the stabilization funds can be drawn down, over time, but
once exhausted, fiscal tightening is required.
Expenditure smoothing. As described, the new law does not aim to isolate expenditure completely
from oil revenue fluctuations, even those that might appear to be temporary. While temporary and
permanent price changes are difficult to gauge, the new reference price formula includes elements
that may be related to long-run price tendencies. The new rule is built to play a smoothing role, and it
will induce a degree of caution in times of rising oil prices. Still, there is the possibility that the new
law could allow a rapid rise in public expenditure, including because the oil reference price formula
puts much weight on short-term oil futures prices, which often move closely with the spot oil price.
(An earlier proposal for the formula, analyzed in the previous Article IV consultation, put more
weight on medium-term futures prices, and would have implied more smoothing, but was not
supported by congress.) Against this, the practice of holding the domestic price of gasoline steady in
real terms, if maintained, will reduce fluctuations in government revenue, and therefore limit the
increase in expenditure that might otherwise be triggered by the new fiscal rule when oil prices rise.
Medium-term expenditure framework. Annual budgets now will be presented in the context of a
long-term quantitative framework, with projections for the next five years, and the costs of new fiscal
measures will have to be explicitly shown. Previously, each administration was required to publish
only one medium-term fiscal plan, in its first year. Other provisions to strengthen expenditure
management include greater transparency and controls over the use of trust funds, greater
accountability in the selection of investment projects and the granting of subsidies, and stricter
monitoring of within-year budget execution. Finally, the law includes steps toward performancebased budgeting, requiring the establishment of indicators to measure program outcomes.

- 19 -

29.
In the meantime, absent such reforms, the mission recommended that fiscal
policy be more cautious than required by the budget law, given the risk of an eventual
decline in oil income. The mission suggested taking advantage of the currently very
favorable external environment—high oil prices, as well as still-low international interest
rates—to adopt a fiscal stance that would be more ambitious than the minimum required by
the Budget and Fiscal Responsibility Law. In particular, the mission recommended avoiding
an increase in the non-oil augmented deficit from its 2005 level, which would translate into
targeting a surplus on the traditional budget measure in 2007.
30.
The authorities agreed that the 2007 budget should aim to save more oil income
than will be possible this year. They planned to prepare a draft of the 2007 budget which
the incoming administration could consider before submitting its own budget to congress.
They noted that the approved 2006 budget will require spending a considerable share of this
year’s unbudgeted oil income, and that there was not much room to overperform on the 2006
budget.
31.
The mission noted that a more ambitious fiscal stance could be based on a
combination of revenue measures and selective expenditure cuts. Tax reform, along the
lines proposed earlier by the authorities, was essential. The recently-published “tax
expenditure” estimates—quite high at 6.7 percent of GDP in 2005—give an indication of the
room available for broadening the tax base.8 Improved tax administration could also play a
role. Another possibility could be to adjust the administered price of gasoline—not only to
remove the implicit subsidy that recently emerged when world prices surged, but also to
move to restore the once-important excise tax on gasoline, which would also address
negative externalities of gasoline consumption.9 On the expenditure side, savings could come
for example from reducing and better targeting subsidies, such as that on electricity use.
C.

Monetary and Exchange Rate Policy

32.
The mission commended the adept implementation of the inflation targeting
framework, noting the enhanced credibility that had resulted from recent convergence.
Following the earlier tightening of monetary policy, the August 2005 decision to begin
reversing that tightening seems well-timed—inflation was brought down, without inducing
an undershooting of the target. Subsequently, when food price shocks took headline inflation
to the top of the variability band, inflation expectations did not rise (in contrast to similar
episodes in the past), suggesting increased credibility. Moreover, the authorities had been
able to reduce interest rates during a time of peso weakness in March and April, without
sacrificing credibility, as it was understood that the inflation outlook justified the moves.
8

For comparison, actual tax revenue was 9.5 percent of GDP in 2005, and oil earnings (net of operating costs
and investment expenditure) were 5.7 percent of GDP.

9

For many years, gasoline pump prices (inclusive of excise taxes) were significantly above U.S. levels. Under
the longstanding policy of holding the domestic price constant in real terms, international prices of gasoline
began to exceed Mexican levels in late 2005. The mission also recommended letting the gasoline price move
with world prices—after first restoring an appropriate after-tax gasoline price level, to avoid locking in a toolow price. Flexible pricing would then prevent a subsidy from re-emerging if world price rises further.
However, because such price flexibility would significantly increase the volatility of oil-related income, it
would make it even more important to save such income during times of high world prices.

- 20 -

33.
The authorities explained the factors that had led them in April to rule out
further easing in the foreseeable future. They did not see any sign of a threat to inflation
from demand pressures or labor market tightness and estimated that some output gap
remains; they also noted the price-disciplining effect of competition from China. On the other
hand, there were some potential upside risks to inflation from external sources, and the
uncertainty surrounding an election period argued for extra caution. Inflation expectations
still about a half point above target also argued for holding a stance that could be
characterized as still somewhat restrictive. The mission shared this assessment of the stance
and risks, noting that continued focus on achieving the inflation target will further entrench
credibility.
34.
The authorities considered that inflation expectations would align fully over time
with the 3 percent inflation target, as policy continued to aim at keeping inflation
outcomes centered on that target. They were broadly satisfied with the results of their
stepped-up efforts to communicate policy to the public. The mission agreed that private
expectations would continue gradually to adjust after having been too pessimistic and
suggested that additional traction could perhaps be gained by further steps in communicating
with the public. The inflation reports published quarterly are an essential communication
device as well as the regular statements after meetings, and the BoM has been increasingly
forthcoming about its inflation projections. The BoM could go further by regularly
publishing formal forecasts at multiple horizons, or by publishing a model of how it views
the inflation process. The authorities indicated that such ideas were kept under consideration,
and their potential advantages and disadvantages were being weighed. On monetary
instruments, it was agreed that the interest rate signals given in the monthly policy
announcements were clear and effective in governing monetary conditions.
35.
The floating exchange rate policy continues to work well. The mission noted the
advantages of the authorities’ hands-off policy regarding the exchange rate, in terms of
transparency, promoting hedging by the private sector, and keeping expectations focused on
the inflation target. The rule for selling a fixed share of the public sector’s foreign exchange
surplus fits well inside this policy of symmetric exchange rate flexibility.
36.
The mission and authorities agreed that NIR had reached a healthy level,
according to standard indicators of reserve adequacy. If the authorities were to decide
that NIR was growing faster than necessary, the mission recommended that any modified
rule preserve the best features of the current one, in which NIR does not respond to exchange
rate developments. Subsequently, the authorities in June announced a debt management
operation that will have the effect of slowing NIR growth this year, while leaving the existing
exchange rate policy mechanisms intact. In this operation, central bank NIR will be used to
pre-pay about US$7 billion of the government’s external debt to the World Bank and IDB.10
10

In compensation, the government will transfer new government paper to the BoM, which the BoM
will exchange in the market for equivalent outstanding liabilities of the central bank. From a
consolidated viewpoint, the operation will leave unchanged the net external debt and the net domestic
debt of the consolidated public sector, while generating net interest savings (essentially because the
interest cost of the prepaid external debt exceeded the interest earnings on NIR).

- 21 -

As a consequence, staff projects that while NIR will continue to grow this year, the increase
will be considerably less than in 2005, notwithstanding higher oil export prices.
D. Financial Issues and Policies
37.
The FSAP Update found considerable progress since the 2001 FSAP, and
confirmed the overall strength and resilience of the financial system. Although financial
intermediation overall is still relatively limited, conditions for its further development are
improving.
38.
Since the 2001 FSAP, a major reform effort has aimed at enhancing the stability
of the financial sector and strengthening its role in providing credit to the private
sector. The supervision of banks and securities has improved significantly. The audit and
debt exchange of disputed bank restructuring bonds removed an important source of legal
uncertainty in the banking system. Market infrastructure has improved, with new legal and
regulatory frameworks for various intermediaries and the modernization of large value
payments systems. Derivatives markets have grown significantly, allowing better
management of risks.
39.
New legislation continues these efforts by strengthening corporate governance,
authorizing private mortgage insurance, deregulating credit that is not funded by
deposits, and creating a new bank resolution framework. The new stock market law
considerably strengthens investors’ rights and enables stock-market listings for smaller firms.
Non-bank credit institutions (Sofoles, which are not permitted to take deposits) will be
deregulated: licensing requirements and restrictions on the market segment they can enter are
being withdrawn gradually. The new bank resolution framework, once complementary
regulations are implemented, will provide clear mechanisms to deal with insolvent
commercial banks.
40.
Helped by good macroeconomic policies, sound oversight, and a favorable
external environment, the financial system has increased its resilience to adverse
shocks. Overall, private banks are profitable and liquid, and their capital is high (currently
over 15 percent of risk-weighted assets).11 Commercial banks appear capable of withstanding
significant market and credit risk shocks, according to tests conducted for the FSAP Update.
41.
Commercial banks’ asset quality continues to improve, although strong growth
of consumer credit could eventually bring some deterioration of credit portfolios. In that
context, the authorities are moving to strengthen further the monitoring of consumer credit
risk. For now, the level of household debt is significantly lower than in other countries, and
overall non-performing loans remain low for both banks and non-bank credit institutions.
Loan loss provisions, in excess of required levels, provide a reassuring cushion.

11

The relatively high CARs are partly explained by banks’ large holdings of government securities,
which effectively carry a zero risk weighting. Government liabilities still account for an important
part of commercial banks’ assets, although this share has declined in the last few years.

- 22 -

42.
Even with the recent growth of credit and securities markets, financial
intermediation overall remains relatively limited, while the INFONAVIT housing fund
plays a significant role.12 Commercial bank credit to non-financial enterprises is no more
than 10 percent of GDP. (In comparison, funds channeled through INFONAVIT reached
5 percent of GDP in 2005.) Local corporate debt issuance increased in 2005, but remains low
at 2 percent of GDP. Domestic equity issuance remains small, somewhat less than
US$2 billion in 2005, although this did represent a ten-fold increase with respect to 2004.
The market for asset-backed securities has been the fastest growing segment of Mexico’s
private debt market, since their legal framework was strengthened in 2003.
43.
Among the recommendations from the FSAP Update, the mission highlighted
priorities for future policies in three areas:
•

Enhancing the supervisory regime and contingency planning, to entrench resilience.
Next steps should include full-fledged consolidated supervision of financial
conglomerates, further enhancing the monitoring of consumer credit risk, creating clearer
rules for inter-agency contingency planning, and adopting a legal framework to guarantee
the political and budgetary autonomy of supervisory bodies.

•

Further rationalization and reform of development banks. Some development banks have
been reformed and have developed market-friendly instruments to promote access to
finance, but some have not reformed (see FSSA report). The challenges include
redefining the mandates of those banks, further consolidating and rationalizing the
system, continuing with current plans to establish a “subsidies bureau” to rationalize the
various financial subsidy and guarantee programs, and implementing performance
indicators. In the growing housing finance market, the SHF, a specialized development
bank for housing, has played a key role in developing the market; it will be appropriate to
stick to the timetable for the SHF to withdraw from financing mortgages.

•

Promoting access to financing and competition. Along with continuing efforts to
strengthen creditors’ and investors’ rights, steps to promote greater competition would
help improve access to financing. For banks, the mission endorsed the authorities’ work
to foster competition by improving disclosure of information on availability and costs of
credit and retail payment services, and by fostering greater cooperation among
institutions in the use of financial infrastructure. For pension funds, the mission
welcomed plans to require transparent disclosure of each fund’s investment performance,
including with reference to investment benchmarks.

44.
The authorities generally concurred with the findings and recommendations of
the FSAP Update. They noted that their most recent reform efforts aimed to address many
12

Infonavit is an autonomous housing fund for private sector employees that receives mandatory
payroll contributions and is required by law to provide housing finance to its affiliates. Infonavit has
increased its dominance of the primary mortgage market, from 49 percent of outstanding balances in
2000 to 60 percent at the end of 2005. Mortgage lending by FOVISSSTE (the equivalent of Infonavit
for public sector employees) adds to the public sector’s large presence in this market.

- 23 -

of the issues. Regarding financial market development, they and the staff expected the effects
of reforms implemented in recent years to accumulate over time.
E. Vulnerabilities and Measures to Boost Resilience
45.
The mission noted Mexico’s success in reducing vulnerabilities and building
resilience. In addition to the strengthened financial system, Mexico benefits from: (i) an
improved public sector balance sheet, especially strong in terms of low exposure to exchange
rate risk;13 (ii) the flexible exchange rate in the context of a credible inflation anchor; and
(iii) levels of external debt and external financing needs, of both the public and private
sector, that are relatively low in international comparisons.

In terms of stocks, net external debt of the consolidated public sector (i.e., net of central bank NIR)
is around 3 percent of GDP. This debt stock is approximately matched by PEMEX’s 2006 net foreign
exchange earnings (to say nothing of the present value of PEMEX’ future income stream). In terms of
current income flows, PEMEX’s net foreign exchange flow exceeds interest on all public external
debt, which was about 1 percent of GDP in 2005. Amortization of all public external debt was about
2½ percent of GDP 2005.

- 24 -

46.
To further reduce vulnerabilities, the mission emphasized continuing efforts to
reduce the public debt ratio and strengthen the debt structure.14 Short-term external
financing needs are low, but the average maturity of the domestic component of the total
public debt, while increasing, is still relatively short. This generates significant gross
financing needs, estimated by staff to be 11½ percent of GDP this year. It would be
important also to bring down further the share of domestic debt indexed to the interest rate.
The authorities confirmed that they would continue in these directions, taking into account
also the costs of extending maturity in the context of an upward-sloping yield curve.
47.
The mission commended the transparent, non-opportunistic approach to public
debt issuance, which has helped build confidence. In an adverse scenario, including a
hypothetical loss of confidence in Mexican assets, it would be advisable to stick to this debt
strategy, and in particular to avoid a large shift in issuance toward debt that is either very
short-term or indexed to interest rates. The authorities commented that fiscal policy would be
the most effective response to such a shock. Finally, the mission recommended consolidating
the analysis and management of public debt to the extent possible, including shifting the
sizable debt of the deposit protection agency (IPAB) to the books of the federal government.
The authorities noted that the latter would require legislation.
48.
Staff’s sensitivity analysis of potential shocks highlights the importance of
continuing to extend debt maturity and of reducing oil risks. A hypothetical “confidence
shock” episode with a hike in interest rates and a sharp depreciation, along with weaker
growth, could put the public debt on an upward path, though not an extreme one. However,
gross public sector financing needs could rise significantly if a shock were sustained and
short-term debt began to be used intensively to finance amortization. Oil risk was also
examined. In the near-term, this is centered on a possible sharp drop in oil prices, but over
longer horizons there is the risk of declining production, and the mission also discussed a
scenario in which oil production would fall in the medium term (Annex V).
49.

The mission suggested that oil-related risks could be contained in two ways:

•

Strengthening the non-oil fiscal balance. Especially if proven oil reserves were to
continue to decline, it would be prudent to aim at a significant reduction over time of
the non-oil deficit.

•

Diversifying risk. From a financial perspective, risks to the public sector could be
reduced by allowing some sharing of risk with the private investors in PEMEX
investment. This would allow the public sector balance sheet to have a safer structure:
a lower level of debt, and a lower share of its assets invested in the oil sector.

50.
Also discussed was a scenario involving lower U.S. and world growth, prompted
for example by a possible loss of confidence in U.S. assets and rising global interest
rates. Activity in Mexico would be particularly affected, through the country’s tight links to
the U.S., while a drop in world oil prices (which is assumed to be triggered by weaker
14

Outside the public sector, the mission noted the absence of signs of financial distress in the
corporate sector, while external debt of the private sector is relatively low, about 10 percent of GDP.

- 25 -

U.S. and global activity) would reduce fiscal revenues. In such a scenario, the fiscal deficit
could widen by 1 to 2 percentage points of GDP, mainly from effects of lower oil prices and
higher interest rates. Again, it was agreed that a fiscal policy response—as indeed would be
required by the new fiscal responsibility law— would be important, while monetary policy
should remain focused on the inflation target.
F. Growth, Competitiveness, and the Reform Agenda
51.
During the past decade, a number of accomplishments have helped set the stage
for faster growth. These include macroeconomic and financial system stability, reforms to
promote a deeper capital market and financial intermediation, and a range of specific reforms
to improve the business environment, and the functioning of particular sectors. Just recently,
laws were passed to improve corporate governance and help fight anti-competitive practices.
Attention also has been given to human capital, with the development of incentive-based
social assistance programs and broader access for health insurance.
52.
Still, Mexico faces significant structural problems that together have prevented
the gains in productivity needed for fast growth (Selected Issues Chapter I). The
problem has several dimensions: the need for better infrastructure to integrate Mexico further
with the rest of North America; the challenge of improving the education system and
building human capital; and the need to address deficiencies in governance, the rule of law
and security, judicial systems, and the regulatory environment. In such dimensions, Mexico
generally lags not only other OECD member countries but also other investment grade
emerging market countries—especially in East Asia. While Mexico has made some progress,
reforms in such areas take time, and it is clear that much room for improvement remains.
53.
Growth is also held back by barriers to flexible resource reallocation and in
some areas by lack of sufficient competitive forces to spur productivity growth. In the
energy sector, legal constraints support a state oil monopoly, and ban nearly all competition
in the electricity sector. Moreover, the governance of PEMEX constrains the company’s
ability to pursue efficiency.15 In the private sector, a number of key sectors are highly
concentrated, and this may translate into pricing power on important inputs16 and limit
incentives to adapt. Regulation makes formal labor markets too rigid (the large informal
sector is more flexible, but participation in the informal sector can be inefficient from a
broader point of view, with negative externalities that slow growth).
54.
Barriers to the dynamic functioning of markets could be addressed on multiple
fronts. The authorities were hopeful that the recent reform of the competition law,
strengthening the federal competition commission, would work as a powerful tool. As
discussed earlier, steps are being taken to promote competition in the financial sector, from
licensing new entrants, to information and transparency requirements that will help consumer
choice. The mission also recommended removing those barriers to external competition that
15

For example, it is difficult to transfer PEMEX oil field workers to a new installation, even after a
well runs dry.
16

Telecommunications is one example, where regulatory oversight so far has been unable to stop
prices that are high in international comparison, as documented by the OECD.

- 26 -

still exist in the form of import licensing requirements and limitations on FDI. While the bulk
of Mexico’s trade is with other NAFTA members—on a very liberal basis—tariffs on goods
from other countries could still be streamlined and reduced.17 More competition could be
allowed in the energy sector. Cutting across sectors, reform of labor regulation would allow a
more flexible allocation of resources, and promote active competition by firms for labor.
55.
In facing challenges in terms of international competition, the authorities and
the mission agreed that these would best be addressed by the structural reforms needed
to boost productivity and growth. Greater microeconomic flexibility—spurred by
competition—was essential, along with a more highly-skilled work force. Attempts to hold
on to existing low-wage activities would be counterproductive to the goal of raising
economic well-being, as well as unlikely to be successful over the medium term. The mission
noted that one symptom of Mexico’s international competitiveness may be the rate of inward
FDI, which is rather low by international comparison (Figure 6). Again, this highlights the
need for structural reforms.
56.
Regarding the real exchange rate, the authorities emphasized that this was a
market-determined relative price that could be expected to respond flexibly to
productivity developments. They considered that there were now no distortions that should
cause the real exchange rate to deviate from a notional equilibrium level.18 The mission
shared this view, and noted that with the external current account near balance, export
volume growing faster than overall GDP, and Mexico’s export market share recently
stabilizing, there were no clear symptoms of exchange rate overvaluation.19 The mission also
agreed that the exchange rate is not an available policy tool for influencing competitiveness.
Any attempts to use nominal policies to manipulate the real exchange rate would run the risk
of boosting inflation, while failing to address underlying competitiveness issues.
57.
In the evolution of Mexico’s real exchange rate, factors seem to be at work in
both directions. The productivity growth differential and supply push from China especially
is a continuing force for real depreciation of the peso. In the other direction, rising receipts
from remittances and oil exports—to the extent that these trigger greater domestic
demand20—are forces for real appreciation.

17

In particular, the tariffs applied on imports from non-preferential partners could be made uniform
and low (the simple average MFN tariff was reported by UNCTAD to be 14.5 percent in 2005, more
than double that of Mexico’s NAFTA partners).

18

Thus Mexico does not have capital controls, nor discretionary exchange market intervention that
responds to the level of the exchange rate.
19

The mission also observed that the real exchange rate, having peaked in 2002, was within about
10 percent of its 1985–2005 average (although structural changes meant that the historical average
was not necessarily an indication of a long-run equilibrium).
20

Both effects may be limited. On remittances, part of the recorded increase reflects only improved
measurement (Selected Issues Chapter II). Regarding oil, the increase in income from net energy
exports has been modest, and it has not translated fully into government spending.

IV. STAFF APPRAISAL
58.
Mexico has come a long way toward establishing the macroeconomic, financial
and social stability needed to foster rapid economic growth. Fiscal discipline has put
public debt on a downward trend and supported confidence. Monetary policy has achieved
low inflation, in the context of a floating exchange rate regime that has promoted smooth
external adjustment. Indeed, the independent central bank has been an important component
of institutional strength and continuity, including at times of political transition. The financial
system—once a source of instability—has been put on a sound footing. Progress also has
been made in reducing poverty through targeted programs. A transition to a multi-party
democracy and a more transparent government is also laying the basis for better governance
and faster growth.
59.
Mexico’s two main economic policy challenges are to fully entrench stability and
to remove remaining obstacles to the economic growth necessary to end poverty.
60.
Monetary policy is well developed, and its job of disinflation nearly complete.
The recent monetary tightening and easing phases were implemented deftly, and the
convergence of inflation to the targeted 3 percent was critical to credibility. Inflation
expectations are now within a half-point of that target; the final disinflation step will be to
close that gap through the maintenance of the central bank’s steady focus on its inflation
target. In the meantime, the authorities could extend their advances in monetary policy
communication by regularly publishing a fuller quantitative forecast of inflation.
61.
The floating exchange rate policy, implemented steadfastly and symmetrically,
continues to serve Mexico well. As the central bank for years has abstained from
discretionary intervention, it is now well understood in Mexico that the exchange rate is
market-determined, and that monetary policy is focused on the inflation target. In addition to
facilitating continuous external adjustment, this policy has given the private sector
appropriate incentives to manage currency exposures.
62.
An essential part of Mexico’s stability is the resilience of the financial system.
This year’s FSAP Update documented this resilience, and the important steps that continue to
be taken to secure it. Looking ahead, the FSAP Update provides a possible roadmap for
further progress. Among the recommendations, several stand out as most fundamental to
entrenching stability, including securing the institutional and budgetary independence of
financial supervisory bodies, improving consolidated supervision of financial groups,
creating clearer rules for interagency contingency planning, and enhancing the monitoring
and analysis of fast-growing household credit. It will also be important to improve further the
mandates, functions, and instruments of the development banks, and rationalize their
operations.
63.
To serve Mexico fully, the financial system will need to be not only stable but
also deeper, providing credit on a larger scale. Today, there are hopeful signs of an
emerging dynamism in the financial sector, and it is likely that further benefits of recent
reforms are in the pipeline. Still, it will be important to continue with reforms and policy
steps to deepen financial intermediation and promote competition.

- 29 -

64.
Sustained fiscal policy discipline has fostered economic stability, as the fiscal
stance has been strong enough to gradually reduce the public debt ratio. However,
chronically weak tax revenue has added to the challenge of providing for adequate social and
investment expenditures while maintaining fiscal discipline. Tax reform proposals deserve
fresh consideration.
65.
Indeed, new policy efforts will be needed to maintain an appropriate fiscal
stance over the medium term. Expenditure pressures can be expected to mount steadily.
Some, such as pressure to expand energy subsidies, should be resisted. Instead, expenditure
on such subsidies should be reduced, by eliminating them or targeting them to those with low
income. Other pressures, such as for enhanced infrastructure and appropriate social
expenditures, are important for long-term growth and poverty reduction, but will be difficult
to meet without raising tax revenue.
66.
So far, oil income has compensated for the fundamental weakness of low tax
revenue—but oil can be an uncertain source of income. Wary of the risks of allowing
public expenditure to track oil prices upward, the authorities have sought to steer the rising
oil receipts of recent years into a mix of deficit reduction and discretionary (non-inertial)
spending, including on investment; so far, they have been able to avoid a major increase in
the non-oil fiscal deficit. Still, the level of the non-oil deficit appears uncomfortably high,
taking into account the relatively low level of proven oil reserves, as well as the size of
public debt. If oil reserves were to continue their decline, fiscal policy will need increasingly
to take into account uncertainties about future oil production and the sustainability of the
non-oil fiscal position.
67.
The oil sector poses a policy dilemma, exacerbated by institutional constraints
and governance issues. On one hand, a low rate of investment in oil could mean a decline in
production, fiscal receipts and exports. On the other hand, committing to additional
investment may be difficult, given concerns about the efficiency of PEMEX, and legal
constraints that mean that oil sector investment can be financed only by public debt, which
may not be desirable. In this context, proposals to reform PEMEX governance, and to allow
risk-sharing with the private sector, deserve new consideration.
68.
To address other potential sources of vulnerability, the staff recommends that
debt management strategy continue along recent lines. Great progress has been made in
reducing the public sector’s exposure to peso depreciation. The relevant challenge now is to
improve still further the structure of domestically-issued debt, especially to reduce the stillsubstantial gross financing needs of the public sector. Debt management would be facilitated
by consolidating the management of all forms of public debt.
69.
While the near-term growth outlook for Mexico remains closely linked to that of
the U.S. economy, medium-term growth will depend on structural reforms. Having
achieved stability, Mexico still has a distance to go in creating conditions for fast growth.
The challenges include improving the education system and building human capital;
enhancing infrastructure; and further improvement in judicial systems, security, and other
aspects of the business and regulatory environment. Moreover, to spur productivity growth,
labor market flexibility and competitive forces in general need to be given more room. The
authorities are right to emphasize reforms such as the new competition law, steps to promote

- 30 -

competition in the financial sector and to remove barriers to labor market flexibility, and the
opening of industries now occupied by state monopolies. Implementation of such pro-growth
reforms is the best way to assure Mexico’s international competitiveness and ability to take
full advantage of globalization.
70.
It is recommended that the next Article IV consultation with Mexico be held on
the standard 12-month cycle.

MEXICO: STATISTICAL ISSUES
Core data are adequate for surveillance. Mexico observes the Special Data Dissemination
Standards (SDDS) and its metadata are posted on the Dissemination Standards Bulletin
Board (DSBB). A data ROSC for Mexico was completed on May 23, 2003 (IMF Country
Report No. 03/150). The overall quality of statistics is good. In a number of cases, the
periodicity and timeliness of disseminated data exceeded SDDS requirements. However,
there are various areas where further improvements could be made. The authorities are aware
of this situation and are continuing work in this regard. Implementation of a constitutional
amendment granting administrative and legal independence to the National Institute of
Statistics, Geography and Informatics (INEGI) is pending further legislative action.
Although some of the balance of payments statistics conform to the fifth edition of the
Balance of Payments Manual, a full transition has not yet been completed. Several measures
to improve external debt statistics have been implemented, including the compilation of data
on external liabilities of publicly traded companies registered with the Mexican stock
exchange (external debt outstanding, annual amortization schedule for the next four years
broken down by maturity, and type of instrument), but a projection of the total external debt
service of commercial banks is still not available. International reserves data are compiled
according to the Operational Guidelines for the Data Template on International Reserves and
Foreign Currency Liquidity of the IMF.
A follow-up national accounts (NA) mission conducted in May 2006 found that most of the
recommendations made by the November 2005 mission on NA methodology have been
implemented. This relates to the compilation of the input-output table and preliminary
estimates for the new base year (2003). The National Institute of Statistics, Geography and
Informatics (INEGI) compiled earlier this year an employment matrix to estimate the nonobserved activities (informal, illegal, and underground), as recommended. The results of the
employment matrix point to some 44 million employees, 12 million more than the figure
included in the NA estimates for 2003.The authorities are planning to include non-observed
activities in a satellite account instead of in the core NA accounts.
The mission also suggested additional data sources and methods to improve the coverage of
non-observed activities; the appropriate dimensions of the input-output table; and the
methodology to compile production accounts for several industries and sectors.
In the fiscal area, the authorities have reported since 2001 a comprehensive measure of the
fiscal balance—the Public Sector Borrowing Requirement—that encompasses the direct net
cost of public investment projects with deferred recording in the fiscal accounts
(PIDIREGAS) as well as the interest cost on a number of government liabilities that had not
been previously recorded. Both the preliminary (available with a 45-day lag following the
end of each quarter) and the final (available mid-year of the subsequent year) data are
published and submitted to Congress, ensuring that revisions are transparent and subject to

- 41 -

ANNEX II

public scrutiny. However, the authorities have not reported government finance statistics
(GFS) for publication in the GFS Yearbook since data for 2000 were reported in 2001.
Monetary data are reported on a regular monthly basis to STA. The authorities have also
completed the migration to the new standardized report forms for the central bank, other
depository corporations, and other financial corporations.

ANNEX IV

MEXICO—RELATIONS WITH THE WORLD BANK
The World Bank Group maintains a substantial program of lending operations, analytical
work and policy dialogue with Mexico. The Bank’s Country Partnership Strategy (CPS) with
Mexico, as discussed by its Board in April 2004, proposes a selective program of IBRD and
IFC operations and a strategic program of analytical and learning services built upon four
strategic pillars: (a) reduce poverty and inequality; (b) increase competitiveness;
(c) strengthen institutions; and (d) promote environmental sustainability. The CPS envisages
a greater focus on the role that the Bank can play as a knowledge institution, while
continuing to deliver a program of lending operations consistent with Mexico’s development
needs.
As of March 31, 2006, the Bank’s portfolio consists of 19 active projects with a total
undisbursed balance of US$2.4 billion. The IBRD exposure in Mexico was US$8.99 billion,
representing 8.84% of the IBRD’s total portfolio.
During FY06, the Bank has extended several loans to deliver support to the four strategic
pillars of the CPS, increasing the lending operations to US$1.79 billion in commitments. In
education, the Bank is supporting the second phase of a plan to improve the quality of basic
education services through a US$240 million loan, which aims to transform the ways schools
are managed. In addition, the Bank provides US$180 million for the first phase of a tertiary
education student assistance program designed to increase the possibilities for young
individuals from lower-income families to continue from secondary education to tertiary
levels of education, increasing their earning power and social mobility. In support of the
national country strategy outlined in the Acuerdo Nacional para el Campo, the access to land
for young farmers project will provide rural development through the improvement of land
markets and access to land as one of the key pillars for reducing rural poverty and inequality.
The Bank also continues to support the strengthening of Mexico’s financial sector, through a
US$501.26 million that focuses on diversifying the financial sector and capital markets to
enhance Mexican competitiveness. The Bank also backs a substantial agenda in the area of
competitiveness through a first programmatic competitiveness development loan of nearly
US$300 million, aiming to promote a cross-governmental approach to improving
productivity in order to accelerate growth and increase exports and employment levels. In
addition, it would support policy and institutional reforms in the following areas:
1) innovation, technology development and training; 2) the investment climate; 3) logistics
and trade facilitation; and 4) energy. Other loans that seek to enhance the provision of
environmental services and secure their long-term sustainability; support the modernization
of Mexico’s water supply and sanitation sector; and support housing and urban development
projects have also been approved by the board.

ANNEX V

MEXICO: DEBT SUSTAINABILITY ANALYSIS, 2006–2011
1. Standardized bound tests
Standardized stress tests, based on the historical volatility of key macroeconomic variables
for the past 10 years, indicate that the level of public debt would not increase substantially
over the medium-term if macro conditions turned out significantly worse than projected.
Public finances. Assuming effective real interest rates close to 7 percent (instead of the
4½ percent staff baseline forecast) or real GDP growth of 1.1 percent (instead of 3½ percent),
the public debt ratio would either increase slightly or decline more slowly than in the
baseline projections. Similarly, public sector financing requirements would increase but in all
cases would stay in the 12-14 percent of GDP range. This resilience largely reflects staff’s
baseline assumption that the primary augmented fiscal balance stays at a surplus of
1-1¼ percent over the medium-term, supported by adherence to the new fiscal responsibility
law (which would require on average a zero overall balance on the traditional budget
measure). In the context of such discipline on the primary balance, even the assumption of
10 percent of GDP in contingent debt is not enough to destabilize debt dynamics. (However,
in the event of a negative shock to oil revenue, maintaining such a balance could require an
important fiscal adjustment effort, as discussed further below.)
External finances. The same standardized tests confirm the strong external position of the
overall Mexican economy. Because of Mexico’s low level of external debt, the deterioration
of the growth outlook, or of the current account primary balance, would have only limited
effects on the future trajectory of external debt and external financing requirements. Of the
shocks considered, the most significant would come from a large exchange rate depreciation
vis-à-vis the US dollar, but even in this case the overall external debt would remain below
35 percent of GDP by 2011.21
2. Oil shock scenarios
A prominent risk scenario would be an inability to significantly strengthen the non-oil fiscal
balance in the context of a sudden and sustained drop in oil prices; e.g., US$ 40 per barrel for
the world average petroleum price from mid-2006 onwards, implying about US$32.5 per
barrel for the Mexican oil mix. Assuming only limited spending cuts, the primary augmented
balance is estimated to shift from a 1¼ percent of GDP surplus to a deficit of the same
magnitude, resulting in an annual increase in public debt of more than 1 percentage point of
GDP and high financing requirements throughout the medium-term.22 On the external side,
the main effects would be a reduction in the pace of reserve accumulation and the ratcheting
21

This applies to the country’s gross external debt. The impact on a net basis is less, due to the
revaluation of the central bank’s international reserves.
22

The actual fiscal impact would depend importantly on the administered pricing of the domestic
energy provided by state enterprises, including gasoline and electricity: if lower international fuel
prices were transmitted to domestic consumers, their effect on the fiscal accounts would be
accordingly greater.

- 45 -

ANNEX V

up of the level of external debt (by 3 percentage points of GDP in 5 years) and external
financing requirements (by a bit more than 3 percentage points of GDP in 5 years).
Another risk is that oil reserves may not be fully replaced and oil production starts declining.
With the goal to approximate what would happen if ongoing exploration efforts do not
suffice to offset declining production at Mexico’s biggest oil field, staff simulated a scenario
in which total oil production declines by 17 percent between 2006 and 2011. In this scenario,
oil exports are projected to decline by almost half by 2011 (faster than oil production because
of growing domestic needs); the annual loss in export receipts, and the annual loss in fiscal
revenues, would both reach close to 2 percent of GDP by 2011. Assuming no offsetting
decline in import volumes or fiscal spending, this shock would end the decline of the external
debt and public debt ratios and in fact put each on upward trajectories. The external debt ratio
in 2011 is then projected five percentage points above its current level, whereas the public
debt ratio in 2011 is projected close to today’s level.
A combination of negative shocks to oil quantities and prices—again assuming passive fiscal
policy—would of course accelerate the deterioration of the external and public debt outlook.
Combining the same oil production decline as earlier with an oil export price of $28 barrel
(its 2001-2004 average), the public debt ratio would reach 52 percent of GDP and the
external debt ratio 31¼ percent by 2011 (respectively 7 percentage points and 9 percentage
points higher than 2005 levels).
3. Other stress scenarios
Considering two other potential sources of stress—a loss of market confidence, or a sharp
slowdown of the US economy—staff estimates indicate that the main challenge would be to
provide for a higher liquidity financing need.
One would risk scenario simply assumes an arbitrary shock to market confidence in Mexican
assets, implying a financial liquidity test, with a rapid deterioration of the exchange rate, a
hike in interest rates, and a return to short-term or interest rate indexed debt as the principal
means to finance the fiscal deficit and public debt falling due. Using magnitudes observed in
recent crisis episodes (outside Mexico), staff finds that the fiscal deficit would not show a
marked deterioration. However, there would be a substantial rise in short-term financing
requirements, which could be a cause for a further deterioration of confidence and further
financial pressures on the public sector. The external position would deteriorate—mostly
because of the lesser value of GDP—but again without creating sustainability or refinancing
risks, given the strength of Mexico’s initial net external asset position.
Finally, basic calculations of the possible effects of a so-called “hard-landing” scenario in the
United States, which would entail sudden economic stagnation, higher domestic interest rates
but also some peso appreciation against the dollar, and declining remittances and oil export
prices, confirm the same sources of potential vulnerability, but with a smaller growth of the
public financing requirement than the previous scenario. Still, in this case, the oil and interest
rate shocks would cause a widening of the fiscal deficit (which in turn could undermine
confidence in public debt, if it were not met with clear signs of a fiscal policy response).

ANNEX V

1/ Indicate coverage of public sector, e.g., general government or nonfinancial public sector. Also whether net or gross debt is used.
2/ Derived as [(r - π(1+g) - g + αε(1+r)]/(1+g+π+gπ)) times previous period debt ratio, with r = interest rate; π = growth rate of GDP deflator; g = real GDP growth rate; α = share of foreign-currency
denominated debt; and ε = nominal exchange rate depreciation (measured by increase in local currency value of U.S. dollar).
3/ The real interest rate contribution is derived from the denominator in footnote 2/ as r - π (1+g) and the real growth contribution as -g.
4/ The exchange rate contribution is derived from the numerator in footnote 2/ as αε(1+r).
5/ For projections, this line includes exchange rate changes.
6/ Defined as public sector deficit, plus amortization of medium and long-term public sector debt, plus short-term debt at end of previous period.
7/ The key variables include real GDP growth; real interest rate; and primary balance in percent of GDP.
8/ Derived as nominal interest expenditure divided by previous period debt stock.
9/ Assumes that key variables (real GDP growth, real interest rate, and other identified debt-creating flows) remain at the level of the last projection year.

Statement by the IMF Staff Representative
September 6, 2006
The following information has become available since the staff report was issued to
Executive Directors. The thrust of the staff appraisal remains unchanged.
1.
Latest data on economic activity confirm a continued strong rebound from the
soft spot in the first part of 2005. GDP growth in the first half of 2006 reached 5.1 percent
on a yearly basis, somewhat above expectations. Employment in the formal sector increased
at an annual rate of more than 61⁄2 percent in June. This momentum, which has been driven
by strong manufacturing exports and domestic demand, appears to have continued into the
third quarter, as manufacturing exports and consumption goods imports both grew by about
20 percent in dollar terms in July.
2.
The inflation outlook has remained broadly stable, with annual rates of both
headline and core inflation at 3.3 percent as of mid-August. In the July survey,
expectations for headline inflation at end-2007 edged down, from 3.5 percent to 3.4 percent,
while expectations for core inflation stayed close to 3.2 percent. In its monetary policy
meeting in late August, the central bank again decided to hold the policy interest rate floor at
7 percent.
3.
In August, the authorities implemented the debt management operations they
had announced in June, but expanded their scale. The government purchased about
US$12.5 billion of international reserves from the central bank, by transferring new
government paper to the central bank, which the bank in turn exchanged in the market for
outstanding central bank bills. The government will soon use these funds to buy back about
US$9 billion of external debt owed to the IDB and the World Bank; US$3.5 billion already
was used to retire outstanding external sovereign bonds. As a result, net international
reserves declined to about US$65.5 billion by August 18, compared to about US$77.5 billion
in late July.
4.
In the financial markets, the sharp gains seen in early July have been
maintained. During August, the stock market, sovereign bonds, long-term domestic bonds,
and the Mexico peso all strengthened.
5.
On August 28, Mexico’s electoral court announced that a partial recount of the
July 2 presidential vote had not altered the result that Mr. Calderon (PAN) had
narrowly edged Mr. Lopez Obrador (PRD).

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2006 Article IV Consultation
with Mexico
On September 6, 2006, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF)
concluded the Article IV consultation with Mexico1.

Background

The economic recovery that began in 2003 has continued. After slowing in the first half of
2005, growth has since rebounded, to exceed 5 percent in the first half of 2006, amid strong
growth in both domestic and external demand. Manufacturing has accelerated this year,
related to stronger U.S. industrial production and a rebound in auto exports. Employment in
the formal sector increased at an annual rate of more than 6½ percent in June, its fastest pace
for the past six years. Bank credit continues to grow strongly, from a low base.
The 12-month headline inflation rate converged to the official target of 3 percent for the first
time toward the end of 2005. While headline inflation picked up again in early 2006 as a result
of volatile food prices, core inflation remained steady and the headline rate came quickly back
down. At mid-August 2006, the annual rates of both headline and core inflation were
3.3 percent. Inflation expectations as reported by central bank surveys have gradually come
down, although they remain slightly above the inflation target.
Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies.
On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by
the Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman
of the Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to
the country's authorities.

Amid an improving inflation outlook, the Bank of Mexico (BoM) began in August 2005 to
unwind its earlier monetary tightening, before stopping in April 2006. In the process,
the overnight interbank rate declined from 9¾ percent to 7 percent. Since April, the BoM has
held monetary conditions steady. The BoM has continued to abstain from discretionary
intervention in the foreign exchange market, following the rule for its foreign exchange sales
announced in early 2003. Still, net international reserves tended to accumulate over time,
driven mainly by the foreign exchange surplus of PEMEX, the state-owned oil company.
With financial markets continuing to show confidence in Mexico, prices of Mexican assets have
moved broadly in line with external markets. After posting strong gains in recent years,
the stockmarket followed other emerging markets downward from May through mid-June
2006, and the peso and sovereign bond also lost some value during this period. Subsequently,
announcement of the July 2 election results appeared to trigger a broad-based rally of Mexican
assets.
The fiscal deficit, and public debt ratio, has continued to decline. The 2005 augmented deficit,
at about 1½ percent of GDP, was half a percentage point of GDP lower than in 2004,
helped by higher oil revenues, a better performance of non-oil revenue collections, and
negative net lending by the development banks. Deficit reduction, combined with the effects of
faster growth and a stronger peso, brought gross augmented debt down to 44 percent of GDP
in 2005, from about 50 percent of GDP in 2003. For 2006, staff projects the augmented deficit
to stay close to last year’s level. While oil-related revenues will rise this year, spurred by higher
prices, adherence to the budget’s fiscal adjustors will require the spending of much of the
unbudgeted oil revenue. Assuming a rebound of development banks’ net lending, the non-oil
augmented deficit is projected to rise, to near 8 percent of GDP.
The external position has continued to improve, helped by favorable external conditions.
Although imports grew strongly, rising remittances and oil exports reduced the current account
deficit to less than 1 percent of GDP in 2005, and the external current account was near
balance in the first semester of 2006. Non-oil exports have performed well recently,
and Mexico’s share in its main market, the U.S., stabilized in 2005 after three years of decline.
Foreign direct investment in 2005 was more than double the size of the current account deficit.
Public debt management has continued to focus on lengthening debt maturity and shifting
away from external debt. The average maturity of the federal government domestic debt rose
from 38 to almost 40 months in 2005. The public sector significantly reduced its rate of
external borrowing in 2005. In August 2006, the authorities began to implement a sequence of
debt management operations that will effectively reduce external debt, and net international
reserves, by about US$12.5 billion. This operation left international reserves at about
US$66 billion at end-August, approximately 1½ times Mexico’s total short-term external debt
(measured on a remaining maturity basis).

Executive Board Assessment
Directors commended the Mexican authorities for establishing the macroeconomic and
financial stability needed to foster growth and resilience to shocks. Fiscal policy has earned
broad credibility and put public debt on a gradual downward trend. A prudent monetary policy
has achieved low inflation, and the floating exchange rate regime has allowed smooth external
adjustment. Directors noted the important progress made in strengthening the financial sector
and creating conditions for its further development. The challenge ahead will be for the new
government to put in place structural reforms that will remove remaining obstacles to growth
while fully entrenching macroeconomic stability.
Directors commended the authorities for reducing the fiscal deficit and the public debt ratio,
and improving the public debt structure. At the same time, they noted that continued reliance
on oil revenues renders the achievement of fiscal policy objectives potentially vulnerable to a
decline in oil prices or production, and therefore suggested containing the non-oil fiscal deficit.
Directors welcomed the adoption of a fiscal responsibility law and medium-term budget
framework. They noted that the chronic weakness of tax revenues will have to be addressed to
achieve the new fiscal target over the medium term, and encouraged the authorities to give
fresh consideration to tax reform proposals. Directors also noted the scope for better targeting
expenditures to make room for more productive social and investment spending. Directors
welcomed renewed investment in the oil sector, but pointed to the need to improve
governance at the state-owned oil company and allow risk-sharing with the private sector in
the financing of its investment program.
On debt management, Directors commended the authorities for the substantial progress in
reducing the public sector’s external exposure. Looking forward, they welcomed the
authorities’ intention to continue extending the maturity of the domestically-issued debt,
thereby reducing public sector gross financing needs. They also suggested consolidating the
management of all forms of public debt.
Directors commended the success of monetary policy in achieving convergence with the
authorities’ inflation target. Directors noted that inflation expectations are declining and are
likely to also converge to the inflation target as the Bank of Mexico continues to focus policy on
that target.
Directors considered that Mexico has been well served by its exchange rate policy, which is
characterized by transparency, symmetric flexibility, and a rules-based approach to reserve
accumulation. This has facilitated external adjustment and given the private sector appropriate
incentives to manage currency exposures. Concerning Mexico’s external competitiveness,
Directors considered that it would depend mainly on the implementation of structural reforms.
Directors welcomed the considerable progress made in strengthening the financial sector and
capital markets and reducing potential vulnerabilities. They encouraged the authorities to
continue with their agenda of financial sector reforms, and highlighted the need to secure the
institutional and budgetary independence of supervisory bodies, improve consolidated

4
supervision of financial groups, create clearer rules for interagency contingency planning,
and enhance the monitoring of fast-growing household credit.
Directors noted that the financial sector was becoming more dynamic, and that bank credit
was expanding after a long period of stagnation. They encouraged continued efforts to deepen
financial intermediation and promote competition.
Noting that achievement of macroeconomic and financial stability had brought a more
favorable environment for growth, Directors encouraged the authorities to move ahead with
ambitious structural reforms to create the conditions for fast economic growth in the medium
term. They highlighted the major challenges faced by Mexico, including improving the
education system and building human capital, enhancing infrastructure, and improving further
judicial systems, security, and other aspects of the business and regulatory environment.
They underscored that market flexibility and competitive forces should be given more room to
spur productivity growth. Directors welcomed recent reforms such as the new competition law
and the modified securities market law, and encouraged the authorities to remove barriers to
labor market flexibility and to the opening of industries that are now occupied by state
monopolies. They considered that implementation of such pro-growth reforms is the best way
to assure Mexico’s international competitiveness and ability to take full advantage of
globalization.
