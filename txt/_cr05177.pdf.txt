EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
Economic Developments
•

Egypt’s new economic team has moved aggressively on key structural reforms
and launched plans to restructure the financial system, privatize state companies,
modernize the fiscal accounts, and strengthen monetary policy. Egypt has increased
transparency and made the transition to a unified, flexible exchange rate regime.

•

The externally-driven recovery has gained steam, underpinned by a moderate
revival in consumption and improved confidence. The Egyptian pound has
appreciated, the stock market has reached record highs, and the current account
surplus has increased, enabling banks and the Central Bank of Egypt (CBE) to
strengthen their net foreign asset position.

•

Macroeconomic policies were accommodative in 2004: monetary policy did not
contain inflation below double digit rates (though inflation dropped sharply to single
digits in the first two months of 2005), and government borrowing and debt remained
high. As in previous years, most of the borrowing was related to “other debt-creating
operations” not captured in the published measure of the general government deficit.
The credit excesses of the late-1990s continued to weigh heavily on banks, hindering
their ability to contribute to the recovery. Bank credit to the private sector declined
again in real terms.

Policy Discussions
•

The unification of the exchange rate was a major accomplishment. The CBE agreed
with staff advice to continue tolerating short-term fluctuations in the exchange rate to
allow it to work as a shock absorber.

•

The authorities are committed to developing, over time, a cohesive monetary policy
framework in the context of a flexible exchange rate. Lacking a nominal anchor, the
CBE agreed with staff that the near-term monetary policy strategy needs to be defined
and communicated more clearly in order to provide better guidance to the market.
Progress in this area will be constrained by the lack of a reliable inflation measure.

•

The high levels of government borrowing and debt in Egypt are inimical to growth
and impede sustained increases in private investment. A multi-year strategy of fiscal
consolidation is needed to lower borrowing and place public debt on a declining path.
The impending costs of financial sector reform strengthen the case for consolidation.
Institutional reform will be necessary to achieve control over government spending.

•

The privatization and financial sector reform programs are most welcome and cover
the key issues, but need more specifics on the modalities, timeframe, and sequence of
their components.

•

Further improvements in Egypt’s macroeconomic database are needed.

I. OVERVIEW AND RECENT ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS
A. Overview
1.
Egypt changed the direction of economic policies sharply in 2004 with the
appointment in July of a pro-reform cabinet led by Prime Minister Nazif. The new cabinet
quickly established its credentials by implementing a number of economic reforms and
announcing plans to restructure the financial sector and privatize most state enterprises. Since
then, work has continued at a steady pace, although the challenges that lie ahead to build a
dynamic, private sector-driven economy are considerable. Output growth remains below the
minimum required to absorb labor force growth, the financial sector is weak, and government
borrowing remains high, raising concerns about fiscal vulnerability and crowding out.
Presidential elections are scheduled for September 2005; the cabinet has to resign prior to the
elections and its reappointment will remain at the discretion of the President-elect.1
2.
The reform program of the new cabinet covers the areas regarded as critical in
recent Article IV consultations. Fund technical assistance has supplemented staff
discussions with the authorities in many of those areas, including tax and customs reform,
budget classification, the exchange rate system, monetary policy, bank restructuring, and
statistics. During 2004, the authorities made substantial progress at reforming the exchange
rate system and liberalizing trade. They also started work to modernize the budget, improve
the monetary framework, restructure the banking system and improve the quality of statistics,
although more remains to be done in all of these areas.
B. Recent Economic Developments
3.
The economic recovery gained steam in 2004. Driven by strong growth in exports
of goods and services, as well as a moderate revival in consumption, real GDP advanced by
4.8 percent in the first half of 2004/05 (July-December) compared to 4.2 percent in the first
half of 2003/04.2 Confidence has rebounded, as reflected in the surge of activity in the stock
market following the appointment of the new government.3 Fitch and Standard & Poor’s
upgraded Egypt’s credit rating, to stable from negative, in December 2004 and March 2005,
respectively.

1

In March 2005, the Egyptian Parliament approved an amendment to the constitution that allows the next
president to be elected by direct popular vote from multiple candidates, rather than by a referendum on a single
candidate.

Fiscal year ends June 30.

Egypt’s stock market has been among the top global performers since 2003. The stock market rally was losing
momentum in early 2004 but resumed strength mid-year; from July 2004 to March 2005, the share price index
rose by over 130 percent. Compared to the 2003 rally, which was driven by only three companies, the recent
surge in share prices has been broad based. Turnover and market capitalization have also increased, though they
remain low by international standards.

Egypt made the transition to a unified, flexible exchange rate regime during
2004. The parallel market rate, which had a premium of over 15 percent in late 2003,
converged with the banking rate

5.
Egypt’s external position strengthened further. All foreign exchange generating
activities exhibited robust growth during 2004, which helped offset a sharp rise in non-oil
imports to their pre-2001 level. The surplus in the external current account rose to 4.4 percent
of GDP in 2003/04, and is expected to be slightly higher in 2004/05. This strength mainly
reflects improved competitiveness stemming from the large real depreciation of the pound
since 2001, although external factors, such as higher oil prices and higher Suez Canal traffic,

-7-

also played a role. The official capital account remains in deficit.4 Foreign borrowing has
been negligible, foreign direct investment (FDI) remains very low, and resident banks
continue accumulating net foreign assets—over US$5 billion in the 18 months to December
2004. Official international reserves remained stable at around $14.5 billion during most of
2004, but began to rise at year-end as the CBE took advantage of market conditions to build
up its reserve position. At end-February, official reserves stood at $17.3 billion, equivalent to
7.2 months of imports. Total external debt remained stable at about US$29 billion
(31 percent of GDP) at end-2004.

6.
Inflation accelerated during 2004. Annual CPI inflation (12-month rate) was close
to 12 percent every month from May to December 2004, while average annual WPI inflation
remained at about 17 percent over this period. The higher inflation reflected lagged
pass-through pressures from the large nominal depreciation of the pound and lax monetary
policy during 2003; for the CPI, the rise also reflected changes in the composition of the

-9-

index made in early 2004.5 Prices actually fell from end-2004 to February 2005: the WPI and
the CPI fell cumulatively by 0.7 percent and 0.2 percent, respectively, bringing 12-month
rates of inflation to below 7 percent.
7.
Real interest rates remained very low, despite a tightening of monetary conditions
in 2004. The CBE allowed interest rates to rise early in the year and moved more
aggressively to absorb liquidity mid-year.6 Accordingly, money growth rates stabilized at
around 14 percent from June onwards. Long- and short-term interest rates, however, stayed
in the 10–13 percent range from April to December 2004, yielding real interest rates of
about, or below, zero throughout 2004. Nominal interest rates declined somewhat in early
2005.
8.
Government borrowing remained high. Total financing to the general government
in 2003/04 was 6.6 percent of GDP, 0.5 percentage points lower than in 2002/03. Borrowing
was driven in part by the deficit of the general government as measured by the authorities,
which was 2.5 percent of GDP—broadly unchanged from 2002/03. However, as in previous
years, most of the borrowing (4.1 percent of GDP) was related to general government
operations captured in the official financing data but not in the published measure of the
deficit (henceforth referred to as other debt-creating operations). Roughly half of those
operations were related to the National Investment Bank (NIB), while payments of
investment arrears and suppliers’ credits accounted for the rest.7 The general government
continued borrowing exclusively from domestic sources, primarily through the placement of
non-indexed bonds with financial institutions (including the CBE).
9.
Preliminary data suggest a continuation of recent trends in government
borrowing in 2004/05. Staff projects a small increase in the general government deficit, to
3.1 percent of GDP, on account of lower customs and nontax revenues.8 Under the
assumption that other debt-creating operations remain broadly at last year’s level, staff
envisages that the total financing needs of the government will be about 7 percent of GDP
during 2004/05.9

5

The CPI in Egypt, including the revised CPI, has significant shortcomings which hinder assessments of
inflation. See Appendix III, and Arab Republic of Egypt—Selected Issues.
6

In mid-2004, the CBE introduced reverse repurchase operations as an additional instrument to absorb
liquidity.
7

The NIB finances the government’s capital expenditure program (which is not controlled by the Ministry of
Finance). The NIB records unrealized interest income as current revenue, consistently overestimating the
resources at its disposal, and giving rise to financing needs that are higher than its operating balance.
8

The authorities expect to receive proceeds of at least US$1 billion from a forward sale of petroleum by the
Egypt General Petroleum Company (EGPC) before the end of 2004/05. Staff assumes that this transaction is
more likely to be completed in 2005/06.

9

At the time of the consultation, the authorities had data on revenues and expenditures for the first half of
2004/05 (July-December 2004), but had only preliminary financing data.

10.
Public debt has continued to rise. Net public debt is now projected to reach
LE 350 billion by end-June 2005, up from LE 312 billion at end-June 2004.10 As a percent of
GDP, however, net public debt is expected to remain below the peak of 66 percent reached in
June 2003, primarily reflecting the large (mostly price-driven) increase in nominal GDP
during this period. Gross public debt reached a peak of 112 percent of GDP in June 2004, but
government deposits with banks grew at a faster pace, reflecting continued deficiencies in the
government’s asset-liability management, reaching 46 percent of GDP by end-2003/04. The
cost and maturity structure of government debt, and the implied near- and medium-term
vulnerabilities, have not deteriorated, and are expected to remain broadly unchanged during
2004/05 (Box 1).
Box 1. Public Debt in Egypt, 2000–04
Egypt’s gross public debt rose by 36 percentage points
of GDP from 2000 to 2004. The rise was driven
mostly by domestic debt, particularly securities; bank
loans to the government declined from 10 to 1 percent
of GDP. The share of external debt in total debt
dropped steadily. Government deposits with banks
have grown significantly, especially since 2002. Part
of these deposits are repayments of rescheduled
external debt kept in “blocked accounts” until they
become due. The other deposits come from several
sources.
The structure of Egypt’s domestic debt stock sheds
light on possible sources of vulnerability:
• Domestic securities are mostly non-indexed; less
than 25 percent are fully tradable and have
maturities below one year.
• Almost half of domestic debt is held by the CBE
and just over 25 percent is held by the financial
sector (mostly banks). The debt held by households
is in the form of saving certificates from the NIB
and post offices.
The investor base and composition of Egypt’s public
debt limit the risk of a destabilizing debt spiral. Large
bank holdings of public debt, however, create other
challenges, including for the valuation of banks’ net
work.

Net public debt is defined as the sum of the general government’s external and domestic debt, minus
government net deposits with banks—including the “blocked accounts” on rescheduled Paris Club debt held at
the CBE. This definition excludes the contingent pension liabilities of the government’s social insurance funds
and includes all government-guaranteed external debt.

The banking system is still not contributing to the recovery. The credit excesses of
the late 1990s continue to weigh heavily on Egypt’s banks. Credit to the private sector
continues to decline in real terms, and most of the recent expansion in banks’ domestic
claims is to the government. Nonperforming loans (NPLs) rose to over 25 percent of total
loans in September 2004, compared to 20 percent in June 2003, and provisioning continued
falling. Given the dearth of new credit, the recent behavior of these indicators mostly reflects
improved classification of old loans and stricter enforcement of prudential regulations. A
scheme outlined by the authorities in early 2004 to restructure the NPLs of public enterprises
has not been finalized, but is part of the new financial sector reform program.

12.
The new cabinet moved aggressively on key structural reforms during its first
months in office (Box 2). The authorities see the modernization of government and
increased private sector participation as key pillars for attaining sustained economic growth.
They have launched ambitious plans to restructure the financial system and privatize most
state companies. Work to increase the transparency and efficiency of government operations
and strengthen the monetary policy framework also has started. The Fund has intensified its
technical assistance to Egypt to support these reforms (see Appendix I).
13.
The new authorities have improved the transparency of economic policies. They
moved rapidly to resolve the outstanding obstacles to subscription to the Special Data
Dissemination Standard (SDDS), to which Egypt officially subscribed in January 2005. The
authorities agreed to the issuance of a press release at the conclusion of the 2005 Article IV
consultation mission, and submitted their official response to the 2003 Data ROSC in
March 2005.11
II. POLICY DISCUSSIONS
A. Exchange Rate and Monetary Policy
14.
Staff welcomed the establishment of the interbank market for foreign exchange,
a key milestone in Egypt’s transition to a unified flexible exchange rate system. Favorable
trends in the balance of payments and increased confidence contributed to the high volume of
trading during the initial weeks of the market’s operation, and to the appreciation of the
pound in January 2005. Staff supported the CBE’s decision to take advantage of favorable
market conditions to strengthen its reserve position.
15.
Discussions covered mechanisms to ensure an orderly functioning of the
interbank market over the medium term, including well-crafted CBE statements to market
participants and opportunistic purchases of foreign exchange. Staff stressed the importance of
continuing to refrain from exerting moral suasion and from resisting pressures on the
nominal exchange rate in either direction. Noting that the normal operation of the market
would give rise to daily and weekly exchange rate fluctuations, staff encouraged the
authorities to tolerate those fluctuations and allow the exchange rate to work as a shock
absorber. The CBE reaffirmed its commitment to allowing market forces to determine the
exchange rate, and agreed with the merits of developing, over time, indicators of “abnormal”
conditions that might warrant a policy response.

16.
The CBE has made progress at improving the focus of monetary policy and
strengthening its technical capacities. In addition to adding reverse repurchase operations
to its toolkit, the CBE is formulating plans, with the assistance of MFD, to increase the
efficiency of monetary operations, including through the creation of a standing facility to
reduce the volatility of interbank rates. Work to examine the channels of transmission and the
lags of monetary policy is also underway. Staff encouraged further improvements in this
direction.
17.
However, developing a cohesive monetary policy framework will take some time.
Considerable work is needed to make monetary operations effective, increase interest rate
flexibility, and effectively anchor inflation expectations under a flexible exchange rate. All
modifications to monetary policy should be closely linked to the CBE’s medium-term
framework; piecemeal changes that could send confusing signals should be avoided. The
CBE should also give priority to upgrading the technical skills of its staff, including through
increased interactions with visiting experts. Staff regretted the delays in producing a reliable
price series, stressing that improvements in monetary policy will only be partial as long as
the inflation measure remains imperfect.
18.
The monetary policy strategy in the near term needs to be defined more clearly.
Staff argued that the monetary regime had been without a clear anchor for inflation
expectations for some time. In addition, as of December 2004, real interest rates were
negative, the slowdown in broad money growth had ceased, asset prices had surged, and the
available measures of inflation did not show a declining trend. Staff underscored the risk that
high inflation expectations could become entrenched. To bolster the credibility of the CBE’s
commitment to low inflation, staff argued for a tightening of liquidity conditions. The
authorities did not agree, noting that higher interest rates would have adverse effects on
output growth.
19.
Clear communication about the general direction of monetary policy should be a
critical component of the near-term strategy. Periodical announcements by the CBE will
provide guidance to the market and help anchor inflation expectations while the main pillars
of the monetary policy framework are being developed. The authorities agreed that monetary
policy announcements would be valuable, and were considering moving rapidly on this front.
B. Fiscal Policy and Public Debt
20.
Staff welcomed the decisive fiscal actions taken in the areas of tariff reform,
income tax reform, and subsidies since September 2004 (Box 2). The authorities
highlighted the importance they attach to fiscal reform in their overall agenda. Staff noted
that reforming Egypt’s public sector would be a demanding and complex task, and agreed
with the authorities on the importance of assessing carefully the sequencing of reforms and
securing continued political support.

- 16 -

21.
Plans to reform subsidies and tax administration are being developed. The
authorities intend to move gradually all implicit subsidies onto the budget to increase the
transparency of public spending.12 Staff welcomed these plans, and recommended replacing
across-the-board subsidies with better targeted social programs. The authorities regard the
modernization of Egypt’s tax system as a priority, and are studying the recommendations of a
December 2004 FAD mission on tax administration.
22.
The official measure of the fiscal deficit underestimates the borrowing needs of
the government. Official estimates of the general government deficit (and its financing)
explain a relatively small part of the annual changes in Egypt’s net indebtedness. Staff
presented an augmented fiscal deficit equal to the sum of the official deficit and other debt
creating operations obtained from the consolidation of financing data.13 This measure
accounts for the bulk of the rise in public debt recorded in recent years; staff regards this as
the best available indicator of Egypt’s fiscal stance, and recommended that it be the key
focus of fiscal policy.
23.
Ongoing efforts to modernize Egypt’s budget and improve treasury cash
management will not necessarily reduce government borrowing. Although the 2005/06
budget had not been finalized at the time of the consultation and was not discussed in detail,
the authorities noted that it was being prepared in accordance with the modified GFSM-2001
classification suggested by FAD. The authorities also intend to follow FAD
recommendations for the establishment of a Treasury Single Account (TSA). Staff agreed
that the new budget classification would improve the transparency of the fiscal accounts, and
that a TSA would help prevent a continued accumulation of government bank deposits.
However, while these reforms are necessary conditions for an efficient control of government
expenditure, they will not result in lower levels of spending, nor affect the fiscal stance in
2005/06, unless supplemented with concrete expenditure-reducing measures.
24.
The overriding goal of Egypt’s public sector reform should be to achieve fiscal
consolidation in order to lower government borrowing and place government debt on a
firmly declining path. The levels of government borrowing and public debt recorded in recent
years are inimical to growth and hinder private investment through many channels, including
by crowding out bank credit and fueling expectations of future tax increases. A multi-year
fiscal consolidation would reduce the risks associated with maintaining government
borrowing and debt at current levels, and would create room for a sustained resumption of
private investment. The lion’s share of the consolidation should fall on government
expenditures (including those financed with the other debt-creating operations), although
there is also scope to strengthen the revenue side. Staff argued that bringing the investment
budget under the full control of the Ministry of Finance (with its attendant consequences for
12

Implicit subsidies (on electricity and fuel products) are much higher than the subsidies recorded in the
budget. The total cost of subsidies has increased in recent years to about 7.7 percent of GDP in 2003/04.
13

These data are prepared by the authorities in accordance with the fiscal reporting framework agreed with the
Fund in 2000, and are shared with staff only during missions.

- 17 -

the NIB) was critical for the success of this strategy, and encouraged the authorities to make
the integration of Egypt’s current and capital expenditure budgets a priority.
25.
The impending fiscal costs of financial sector reform strengthen the case for
fiscal consolidation. Staff stressed the importance of producing realistic estimates of the size
and expected timing of the net additions to government debt associated with the future
recapitalization of public banks.14 Those additions will be inevitable and have to be well
timed to minimize their adverse effects on market perceptions of Egypt’s fiscal solvency.
Staff encouraged the authorities to revise and update the estimates periodically, including
their distribution over time, and evaluate the effects they may have on public debt dynamics.
26.
Staff projections show that Egypt’s public debt-to-GDP ratio will not fall unless
the government reduces its total borrowing. The medium-term fiscal scenarios presented
to the authorities linked explicitly the augmented fiscal deficit to changes in net public debt
under the current policy stance, and under various paths of fiscal consolidation. Egypt’s high
levels of public debt and government borrowing were assumed to impede sustained increases
in private investment and restrain output growth below its long-run average of 5.2 percent
under all scenarios (Box 3). Figure 7 and Tables 5–6 summarize the results from two
scenarios: the first (baseline) scenario assumes that government borrowing remains between
6 ½–7 percent of GDP until 2009/10, while the second assumes that government borrowing
falls by about 1 percent of GDP per annum.15 Two results are noteworthy. First, keeping
government borrowing at the levels of recent years would not reduce the public debt-to-GDP
ratio, and could lead to a ratio of 80 percent by 2009/10 if growth slowed suddenly. Second,
a decline in government borrowing of 1 percent of GDP per annum for five years would
lower the public debt ratio by about 8 percentage points of GDP; staff regards this as the
minimum adjustment needed to place public debt on a firmly declining path, thereby creating
room to absorb shocks and contingent liabilities, particularly related to bank restructuring.16

14

One estimate of the total cost of the bank reform mentioned by the authorities is US$7 billion (8 percent of
2004/05 GDP). The basis for this estimate, and the distribution over time of the expected costs, are unclear.
15

The baseline (current policy stance) scenario assumes that the other debt-creating operations remain at their
2003/04 level (4 percent of GDP) and that the general government deficit falls to 2.4 percent of GDP by
2009/10 on account of a gradual recovery in current revenues (from higher income tax intake and improvements
in tax administration) and restraint in current expenditures (including wages). The steady adjustment scenario is
compatible with many fiscal consolidation strategies. Staff recommended an approach that placed the burden of
adjustment on total government expenditures (paragraph 24).
16

Owing to the uncertainties surrounding its expected fiscal cost (see footnote 14), the scenarios did not
incorporate explicitly any government borrowing related to financial sector reform.

Box 3. Accounting for Growth in Egypt, 1960–2004
Economic growth in Egypt slowed from 6 percent (annual average) during the 1960s and 70s, to 4.8 percent
during the 1980s and 90s, and further to 3.5 percent from 2001–04. Physical capital accumulation was the
biggest contributor to growth in output per worker from 1961–2000, but its contribution fell sharply after 2000.

Staff estimates suggest that investment growth would need to recover strongly, and/or be compensated by
sustained increases in productivity, for output growth to rise to its historical average. For example, assuming TFP
growth at its long-run average (0.9 percent), real gross fixed investment would need to increase by 12.4 percent per
year on average in order for output growth to rise to 4.8 percent, the rate prevailing from 1981–2000.

27.
The authorities stated their commitment to reducing the fiscal deficit, but were
not prepared to endorse staff’s recommendation of adopting a multi-year fiscal consolidation
strategy. They noted that the ongoing modernization of the budget, supported by a tightening
of intra-government financial linkages, would reduce the other debt-creating operations and
contribute to lower public debt. The authorities also stressed that progress in lengthening the
maturity of domestic debt will continue.
C. External Sector
28.
The medium-term outlook for Egypt’s balance of payments remains favorable.
The strong export performance since end-2002 has been broad based and is underpinned by
favorable global and regional conditions. Continued development of its tourism potential and
vast gas resources will strengthen further Egypt’s supply of foreign exchange. Staff’s
medium-term projections show that a marked slowdown in the pace of current account
inflows could accommodate non-oil import growth of about 7 percent per annum and still
leave the current account (and the overall balance of payments) in surplus over the medium
term (Table 7). The projections also suggest that there is scope for some real appreciation of
the pound over the medium term. In the staff’s view, only the joint occurrence of several
adverse shocks (i.e., to oil/gas prices, Suez Canal traffic, or tourism) would weaken
significantly Egypt’s external outlook. As in the last Article IV consultation, Egypt’s external
debt sustainability analysis reveals no major vulnerability; the external debt-to-GDP ratio and
the external debt service ratio are projected to decline steadily over the medium term, even in
the face of adverse shocks (Table 8).
29.
Staff highlighted weaknesses in official estimates of Egypt’s balance of
payments. Long-standing deficiencies in source data and in the methodologies used to
construct the balance of payments distort the information content of the current, capital, and
financial accounts. For example, correcting for under-recording of FDI inflows, including in
the oil and gas sector, and for inadequate estimates of outflows in the capital account

- 20 -

associated with tourism, the capital and financial accounts would register a surplus rather
than the deficit recorded in the official estimates (about US$5 billion in 2003/04).17 18
Current account surpluses would also be lower if the trade balance was estimated using
partner country data for exports and imports. While these problems were not seen as
fundamentally altering Egypt’s medium-term external outlook, staff stressed that they
hampered the assessment of cyclical macroeconomic conditions and external
competitiveness. They also hindered the authorities’ ability to undertake timely policy
responses, including to sudden movements in capital flows. The authorities were generally
receptive to these observations, and indicated that their first priority was to improve the
recording of FDI flows.
D. Macroeconomic Data
30.
Staff welcomed the progress made in strengthening the macroeconomic database
during 2004, but noted that considerable work was still needed to improve the quality of
Egypt’s data. Staff welcomed in particular Egypt’s subscription to the SDDS, noting that the
process had helped mobilize the different sources and data outputs in the country. The
authorities indicated that they now plan to turn their attention to improving the quality of
statistics. Staff supported this change in focus, and stressed that Egypt’s economic data
continues to suffer from a number of deficiencies (Appendix III) that hamper the authorities’
ability to monitor macroeconomic developments, as well as the effectiveness of Fund
surveillance.
31.
The authorities should move rapidly to revamp Egypt’s overall statistics
strategy. Increased coordination among agencies would accelerate improvements in the
quality of statistics, and maximize gains from technical assistance. Staff advised the
authorities to undertake the recommendations in the 2003 Data ROSC, and to give priority to
the fiscal accounts, price statistics, and the balance of payments. Improvements in all
indicators of economic activity and in employment and wage data also are needed. Staff
highlighted the importance of reliable time series for the formulation of macroeconomic
policy, and encouraged the authorities to adopt the practice of updating historical time series
in a consistent manner.

See Arab Republic of Egypt−Selected Issues.

The difference between a headcount-based estimate of tourism-related inflows (US$5.5 billion in 2003/04)
and the estimates obtained from banking sector data (US$2.3 billion in 2003/04) are recorded as an outflow in
the capital account. Staff recommended recording only the flows based on direct estimates of tourist arrivals,
and to let the errors and omissions line offset any upward bias implicit in that estimate. The balance of
payments in Table 7 follows this methodology.

- 21 -

III. FINANCIAL SECTOR ISSUES
32.
Staff commended the government for its ambitious financial sector reform plan.
The authorities have been working diligently to advance progress according to the plan’s
broad objectives (Box 2). The task at hand is formidable: the plan contemplates cutting the
number of banks roughly in half and raising the market share of private banks significantly
above its present level of about one third over a five-year period.19 It also aims at increasing
private sector participation in the insurance industry, developing the mortgage market, and
consolidating regulations and supervision for all financial entities. While the plan covers all
the key issues, the specifics concerning the modalities and sequence of some critical
components still need to be developed, particularly the mechanisms to resolve the NPLs of
public and private enterprises, and the assessment of banks’ recapitalization needs. Staff
emphasized the importance of developing concrete action plans in all of these areas to avoid
ad-hoc implementation and ensure sustained political support for the reform.
33.
The next step should be a diagnosis of the financial position of the state banks to
ascertain the quality of their assets and recapitalization needs. The authorities indicated that
work on assessing the financial status of all banks was underway, including through external
audits by international firms.20 The authorities were encouraged to move expeditiously to
deliver on near–term targets, particularly the divestiture of joint venture banks and the sale of
Bank of Alexandria by end-2005. In addition, staff recommended that any debt issued in
connection with the bank restructuring be fully tradable, and be issued by the government
rather than the central bank or any other entity.
IV. STRUCTURAL REFORMS AND OTHER ISSUES
34.
Staff welcomed the relaunching of Egypt’s privatization program. The recent sale
of the remaining stake in a large cement company attests to the government’s renewed
commitment to the program. The authorities should adhere closely to their targets, and
prepare periodical estimates of the proceeds expected from the divestitures, given their fiscal
implications.21 Staff advised the authorities to allocate most of the privatization proceeds to
reducing government debt, and to establish mechanisms of accountability for the use of the
proceeds. The authorities indicated that the government had decided to channel all
privatization proceeds through the Ministry of Finance.
35.
The September 2004 reform of Egypt’s tariff regime was an important milestone
(Box 2). Staff encouraged the authorities to consider further cuts in import tariffs as well as
19

Egypt’s banking system has total assets of about US$100 billion and consists of 54 banks: six state banks
(56 percent of total assets), 35 joint venture banks (38 percent), and 13 foreign banks (6 percent).
20

The World Bank has been asked to take the lead in coordinating the financial and technical support for the
financial sector reform, but the authorities count on continued technical assistance from MFD.
21

For calendar year 2005, the government has offered for sale 54 nonfinancial “government assets”
(companies, shares in companies) as well as government shares in 29 nonfinancial joint venture companies. The
list is available at: www.investment.gov.eg.

- 22 -

reductions in the extensive system of exemptions and duty relief schemes, which were not
addressed by last year’s reform.
36.
The authorities should continue forging ahead with structural reforms that
create employment opportunities and help alleviate poverty. Staff noted that a modern
labor market legislation would reinforce the positive incentives for private investment and
employment generated by the reforms undertaken by the new government, and suggested
adding labor market reform to the agenda.
37.
The authorities are committed to making further progress in the area of
transparency, and are considering publishing the 2003 Data ROSC.
38.
Staff was not apprised of any new information regarding the pending issues related to
fiscal reporting under the 1996–98 IMF program.22
V. STAFF APPRAISAL
39.
Economic performance during 2004 showed improvement. The externally-driven
recovery gained steam, underpinned by a moderate revival in consumption and improved
confidence. The current account surplus increased, enabling banks (including the CBE) to
strengthen their net foreign asset position, and facilitating the unification of the exchange
rate. Monetary policy was supportive of the exchange rate unification, but did not contain
inflation below double digit rates. Government domestic borrowing remained high and bank
credit to the private sector remained sluggish.
40.
The economic reform program being pursued by the present cabinet is
commendable. The program attaches top priority to modernizing government and to
reducing government interference in market mechanisms, necessary conditions for
accelerating Egypt’s transformation into a dynamic, private sector-driven economy. In its
first eight months in office, the new cabinet has shown strong commitment to economic
reform by implementing decisive measures in the areas of customs tariffs, taxes, and
subsidies; by launching ambitious programs of privatization and financial sector reform; and
by significantly increasing transparency. The Fund has intensified its technical assistance in
support of the authorities’ reform efforts. Modernizing Egypt’s government, however, will be
a challenging and complex task. The authorities should continue assessing carefully the
sequencing of reforms, and securing the political support needed to maintain momentum.
41.
The unification of the exchange rate was a major achievement. The disappearance
of the parallel market premium has removed a serious distortion from the economy. The
launching of the interbank market for foreign exchange and Egypt’s acceptance of the
obligations of Article VIII are also very positive. An exchange system free of restrictions
with a market-determined rate will be beneficial for foreign investment, increase the
economy’s resilience to shocks, and improve macroeconomic management. The authorities
22

The explanation of a possible discrepancy between data on government financing and government debt for
1997/98 and earlier years remains outstanding. See Appendix III.

- 23 -

should continue to tolerate short-term fluctuations in the exchange rate to fully reap the
benefits of a flexible exchange rate system.
42.
Monetary policy should be more forward-looking and provide better guidance to
the market. The conduct of monetary policy improved during 2004, but central bank actions
were not always clearly aimed at reducing inflation, and the system lacks a nominal anchor.
The CBE should intensify its efforts to develop a cohesive monetary policy framework that
effectively anchors inflation expectations in the context of a flexible exchange rate, and that
relies on a proactive interest rate policy. This process, however, will take some time to
complete. Moreover, the serious shortcomings with the inflation measures in Egypt pose an
important handicap to assessments of the monetary policy stance, and to improvements in
monetary policy formulation. While the main pillars of the medium-term framework
(including a reliable inflation series) are being developed, the central bank should monitor
carefully all price indicators, including asset prices, and communicate more clearly its
near-term monetary policy strategy. Periodical announcements by the CBE about the general
direction of monetary policy would be particularly well suited for this purpose. A tightening
of liquidity conditions could enhance the effectiveness of the first announcement.
43.
Fiscal consolidation should be the cornerstone of Egypt’s public sector reform.
The high levels of government borrowing and public debt recorded in recent years are
inimical to growth and impede sustained increases in private investment. A multi-year
strategy of fiscal consolidation that lowers total government borrowing and places public
debt on a firmly declining path will increase the likelihood of a robust response from private
investment and higher medium-term growth. The fiscal costs of the financial sector reform,
which are likely to be significant, further strengthen the case for sizable medium-term fiscal
consolidation.
44.
Effective control over all government spending is necessary to design an efficient
fiscal consolidation strategy. Ongoing efforts to modernize budget processes and improve
treasury cash management will help attain this goal, though they will have to be
supplemented by concrete expenditure-reducing measures to tighten the stance of fiscal
policy. Bringing the investment budget under the full control of the Ministry of Finance
would provide a more solid basis to control government spending over the medium term and
ensure its most productive use. Staff encourages the authorities to make the necessary
institutional changes (including those affecting the NIB) a priority of Egypt’s public sector
reform.

Clear goalposts and adherence to targets will help sustain progress in the
privatization and financial sector reform programs. The companies listed for sale in 2005
(posted on the Ministry of Investment’s website) is a welcome first step. Similar
dissemination vehicles could be useful for aspects of the financial sector reform program,
such as the planned divestiture of joint-venture banks. In order to fully incorporate the fiscal
implications of these programs, the authorities have to be more specific about the timeframe
and modalities of key reforms, particularly the plans to resolve the NPLs of public and
private enterprises, and the assessment of banks’ recapitalization needs.

Further improvements in Egypt’s macroeconomic database are needed.
Longstanding shortcomings in the fiscal accounts, price statistics, the balance of payments,
and indicators of economic activity affect the authorities’ ability to monitor economic
developments. They also hinder the quality of economic analysis and macroeconomic policy
formulation. Closer coordination among agencies is necessary to accelerate improvements in
the quality of statistics. Staff encourages the authorities to undertake the changes needed to
facilitate this coordination and to implement promptly the methodological improvements
suggested in the 2003 Data ROSC.

It is recommended that the next Article IV consultation be conducted on the standard
12-month cycle.

1/ The baseline scenario assumes that the general government deficit declines slightly, while other debt creating operations remain at the 2003/04 level. The steady adjustment
scenario assumes that total financing needs decline by 1 percent of GDP per year starting in 2005/06.
2/ As recorded above the line (official estimate of the general government deficit).
3/ Includes arrears payments, assumption of debt, suppliers’ credits, other NIB debt-creating operations, and statistical discrepancy.
4/ Projections do not include any estimate for the costs of bank restructuring or privatization receipts.
5/ Net of government deposits with banks. Deposits include the “blocked accounts” on rescheduled Paris Club debt held at the CBE. Deposits with banks are projected to
remain constant in nominal terms; blocked accounts are projected to decrease according to the repayment schedule.
6/ Includes government guaranteed debt, but excludes the contigent pension liabilities of the government’s social insurance funds.

Projections
2004/05 2005/06 2006/07 2007/08 2008/09 2009/10

Sources: Egyptian authorities; and IMF staff estimates.
1/ General government debt minus deposits with banks. Deposits include the “blocked accounts” on rescheduled Paris Club debt held at the CBE.
2/ Deposits with banks are projected to remain constant in nominal terms, while blocked accounts are projected to decrease according to the repayment schedule.
3/ Includes government guaranteed external debt, but excludes contigent pension liabilities of the government’s social insurance funds.
4/ Based on official presentation. Is not a meaningful measure of the “primary deficit” because it omits outlays that are captured in the financing data.
5/ Derived as [(r - π(1+g) - g + αε(1+r)]/(1+g+π+gπ)) times previous period debt ratio, with r = interest rate; π = growth rate of GDP deflator; g = real GDP growth rate; α = share of foreign-currency
denominated debt; and ε = nominal exchange rate depreciation (measured by increase in local currency value of U.S. dollar).
6/ The real interest rate contribution is derived from the denominator in footnote 5/ as r - π (1+g) and the real growth contribution as -g.
7/ The exchange rate contribution is derived from the numerator in footnote 5/ as αε(1+r).
8/ Includes suppliers’ credits, NIB debt-creating operations, and statistical discrepancy as reported by MoF.
9/ For projections, this line includes exchange rate changes.
10/ Derived as nominal interest expenditure divided by previous period gross debt stock.

A. Alternative Scenarios
A1. Key macroeconomic variables are at their historical averages in 2005–09
A2. Steady adjustment scenario; total financing needs decline by 1 percent of GDP per year from 2005/06
B. Bound Tests
B1. Real interest rate is at historical average plus two standard deviations in 2005/06 and 2006/07
B2. Real GDP growth is at historical average minus two standard deviations in 2005/06 and 2006/07
B3. Primary balance is at historical average minus two standard deviations in 2005/06 and 2006/07 4/
B4. Combination of B1–B3 using one standard deviation shocks
B5. One time 30 percent real depreciation in 2005/06

APPENDIX I

Exchange Rate Arrangement (As of February 28, 2005)

Prior to January 29, 2003, the Egyptian pound was pegged to the dollar, with all foreign
exchange transactions taking place within a ±3 percent range around the central rate, which
was announced by the Central Bank of Egypt (CBE). Effective January 29, 2003, the Egyptian
pound was allowed to float. As a result, the exchange arrangement of Egypt was reclassified to
the category “managed float with no preannounced path for the exchange rate,” from the
category “pegged exchange rate within horizontal bands.” However, from February 2003 to
August 2004, not all current account transactions were satisfied in the banking exchange
market and demands were channeled and cleared in an illegal parallel market at a variable
premium that consistently exceeded 2 percent. In December 2004, the CBE officially launched
a foreign exchange interbank market with no restrictions on rates, governed by a formal
interbank convention on foreign exchange trading. There have been no quotes of the parallel
market rate since December 2004. The CBE buys and sells foreign exchange daily at the
average exchange rate observed in the interbank market at the end of the prior day. On any
day, the differential between the banking exchange rate and the exchange rate used by the CBE
has been consistently below 2 percent.
Egypt accepted the obligations of Article VIII, Sections 2, 3, and 4 on January 2, 2005. Fund
staff is undertaking the necessary review of Egypt’s foreign exchange system in connection
with its acceptance of Article VIII. Egypt still maintains bilateral payments arrangements with
Sudan and Russia (the latter non-operative), which represent exchange restrictions under the
Fund’s jurisdiction.
VIII. Article IV Consultation
Consultations with Egypt are on a 12-month cycle. The last Article IV consultation discussions
were held in Cairo from February 2 to 16, 2005. The 2004 Article IV staff report was

APPENDIX II

Egypt: Relations with the World Bank
(as of February 2005)
1.
Partnership for Development. The key development objectives and targets of the
Government of Egypt are expressed in the fifth Five Year Plan for Socio-Economic
Development covering the years 2002–2007. Overall, Egypt seeks to achieve growth with
equity by enhancing the role of the private sector in the development process; focusing the
public sector on delivering public goods; and strengthening the social safety net system.
2.
World Bank Country Assistance Strategy. Within the context of a modest lending
program relative to the size and importance of the country, the government and the World
Bank are currently discussing a Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) which is likely to
increase substantially the program of World Bank lending and non-lending assistance over
the medium-term. The current Bank program is based on the CAS for the period FY02–FY04
which was endorsed by the Board of Directors on July 3, 2001. The main areas of support
identified in that CAS were interventions that (i) supported higher and sustained growth;
(ii) targeted direct poverty reduction; and (iii) aimed at indirect poverty reduction. During
2004/05, the Bank program commenced support for the government’s efforts: (i) to assess
impediments to investment and to implement structural reforms (including financial sector
reforms); (ii) improve public expenditure management; and (iii) develop the mortgage
market. Work on the new CAS started in October 2004, with consultations in Cairo with the
authorities, development partners and civil society. This CAS, which will cover the period
fiscal years 2006-2009, is expected to be presented to the World Bank’s Board in June 2005.
IBRD/IDA Portfolio
3.
As of February 28, 2005, the Bank had approved 110 projects for Egypt, valued at
about US$5.2 billion (excluding grants and cancellations), of which about US$4.6 billion has
been disbursed, and about US$650 million remain undisbursed. The current portfolio has
16 active projects with a commitment value of about US$1 billion. The sectoral composition
of the current portfolio (by value) is as follows: 34 percent for infrastructure, 28 percent for
agriculture, 20 percent for education, 10 percent for health and nutrition, 5 percent for social
protection, and 3 percent for environment. The largest project in the portfolio is an Airports
Development Project for US$335 million.
International Finance Corporation (IFC) Investments
4.
The IFC is actively involved in Egypt with 24 operations in its portfolio. As of
December 2004, the IFC’s committed portfolio in Egypt amounted to US$299 million, with
an additional US$313 million in B loans. These investments are in a range of sectors,
including the financial sector, infrastructure, small and medium enterprises, manufacturing,
chemicals, and tourism. In 2003/04, the IFC committed to five new investments for
US$60 million in the following sectors: housing finance, financial institutions,
manufacturing, infrastructure and gas resources. Commitments to date for 2004/05 amount to
US$15 million, with several projects in the pipeline.

APPENDIX III

EGYPT: STATISTICAL ISSUES
1.
National accounts. National accounts data are compiled on an annual fiscal year
basis and on a quarterly basis by the National Accounts Department within the Ministry of
Planning in current and constant prices, using the 1993 System of National Accounts (SNA
1993). The data have a number of shortcomings, including inconsistencies with the balance
of payments and the absence of a reliable series on GDP at constant market prices. In
addition, the base year is often changed and no backward revision is made to previous series
to allow for historical comparison. Coverage of an apparently large informal sector remains
an issue. Shortcomings in the accuracy and reliability of annual and quarterly data prevent a
reliable and timely analysis of economic developments. The problem is exacerbated by the
absence of a reliable system of short-term indicators of economic activity. The authorities
requested IMF technical assistance in this area in 2000. An STA consultant joined the
2001 Article IV mission and provided specific recommendations in the compilation and
dissemination of high frequency real sector data. The authorities have been collecting a
monthly index of industrial production since January 2002, which was first published in
April 2003. This index is unsatisfactory, comprising a manufacturing index based on
production valued at constant wholesale prices in Egyptian pounds, a Suez Canal index based
on receipts in U.S. dollars, and other indices based on volumes. In January 2005, the
components of the industrial production index were re-weighed and the base was modified in
a way that precludes making month-to-month comparisons of the index. The October 2003
Data ROSC mission found that work to improve national accounts statistics was still needed,
including a more critical review of source data. There are no periodic user surveys or an
oversight body to provide guidance on the quality of national accounts. USAID is assisting
the Ministry of Planning in the construction of a reliable historical series on investment and
the capital stock.
2.
Price and labor market statistics. The October 2003 Data ROSC determined that
the CPI index may not be accurate. The basket and outlet samples used to compile the CPI
are outdated, and subsidized and controlled goods and services dominate the basket,
introducing downward bias in the index. An updated CPI with new weights based on the
results of the 1999–2000 household expenditure survey was first published in April 2004; the
first observation covered by the new index was July 2003. This new CPI suffers from the
same shortcomings as its predecessor. No systematic reviews are undertaken to identify
shortcomings. The authorities have upgraded their computer equipment and are developing a
comprehensive price database, through the USAID-supported Data Project team. Plans are
underway to replace the wholesale price index with a producer price index and to improve
the external trade price indices (the latter are also unreliable and available only annually). In
early 2005, the authorities requested further technical assistance from the Fund to improve
the CPI and PPI. The request is being considered by STA in coordination with METAC and
the USAID’s Data Project. The timeliness of employment and unemployment data, as well as
the periodicity and timeliness of wages/earnings data, do not yet meet SDDS requirements.
3.
Balance of Payments statistics. The balance of payments statistics, compiled by the
CBE and reported to the Fund, have been revised with Fund technical assistance in

- 40 -

APPENDIX III

accordance with the Fifth Edition of the Balance of Payments Manual. Although the national
presentation is less detailed than in BPM5, data are provided to international organizations
using BPM5 format. The October 2003 Data ROSC noted that Egypt’s balance of payments
statistics face problems with source data. Because merchandise trade statistics based on
customs declarations have serious problems, the balance of payments has to rely on banks’
foreign exchange records for exports and imports of goods. However, the coverage and
classification of foreign exchange transactions are not keeping pace with economic
liberalization and source data do not reasonably approximate accrual basis. Capital flows in
the balance of payments also suffer from serious deficiencies. In particular, the differences
between direct estimates of tourism receipts and those collected from the banking sector are
incorrectly booked as an outflow in the capital and financial accounts. Another main data
problem is the large discrepancy in the FDI data published by the CBE and the General
Administration of Foreign Investments and Free Zones (GAFI). The discrepancy mainly
stems from differences in the definitions of FDI employed by the two agencies. Technical
assistance is currently being provided to help reconcile the concepts and methodologies, and
the government has created a committee to coordinate the work on FDI. A December 2004
STA mission noted that the CBE had started to disseminate quarterly balance of payments
data and provide detailed sources and methods on the CBE website on the basis of BPM5.
4.
External debt and international investment position (IIP) data. Data on the IIP
and external debt now meet SDDS requirements. The authorities are drawing on advice from
Fund staff and other outside advisers on forming a strategy to strengthen the reporting system
on nonguaranteed debt. A December 2004 STA mission reached agreement with the
authorities on the treatment of expected loan disbursement data in the foreign currency
liquidity template. Anticipating loan disbursements is not permitted under the International
Reserve and Foreign Currency Liquidity: A Guidelines for a Data Template (Reserves
Template Guidelines). In order to accommodate the authorities’ concerns over the potential
market reaction, a new section containing the relevant data was included at the end of the
Reserves Template.
5.
Fiscal data. Questions arose in the 2000 Article IV consultation as to whether the
fiscal data provided by the authorities were adequate for surveillance. A key issue was the
discrepancy between data on government financing and on government debt, which led to an
upward revision of the fiscal deficit for 1998/99. Subsequently, an updated comprehensive
fiscal reporting framework was developed with the authorities, covering fiscal data from
1998/99 onwards. Data for earlier years, for which discrepancies between debt and financing
data also exist, have not been revised. In 2001, the authorities began to use the new fiscal
reporting framework for the compilation and provision of fiscal data to Fund staff.
Refinements in the calculations of government financing were made in early 2002. Staff
resources at the Ministry of Finance for the calculation of fiscal data are limited, and all
processes in the accounting system are done manually, which has an impact on efficiency.
Fiscal data are reported primarily on a cash basis. However, investment expenditures in the
budget sector and the accounts of the Social Insurance Funds and economic authorities are
reported on an accrual basis. A new budget classification system broadly in compliance with
GFSM-2001 was developed during 2004 with assistance from FAD, and will be used for the

- 41 -

APPENDIX III

2005/06 budget. Since SDDS subscription, fiscal data are published on a quarterly basis with
a lag of 45 days. Egypt does not report fiscal data for publication in the International
Financial Statistics (IFS); annual data—through 2002—are reported for the Government
Finance Statistics (GFS) Yearbook. The authorities will be encouraged to resume regular
reporting of fiscal data.
6.
Monetary statistics. The statistics are comprehensive and reported regularly. The
2003 Data ROSC identified the possibility that foreign assets and foreign liabilities of the
banking sector, as recorded in the monetary statistics, could be overstated because one
offshore bank located in Egypt is erroneously treated as a nonresident entity. Since October
2002, the CBE has been recording outstanding auction balances and reverse repurchase
operations as part of reserve money rather than excluding them as suggested in the Monetary
and Financial Statistics Manual.
7.
Data dissemination. Egypt subscribed to the SDDS on January 31, 2005. Egypt
availed itself of its two allowed flexibility options under the SDDS on issues related to the
timeliness and periodicity of government operations, and labor market data.
8.
Data ROSC. A data ROSC was conducted in October 2003. The authorities provided
their official response to the draft in March 2005, but have not yet indicated their consent to
publishing the ROSC. Consequently, data ROSC ratings are not reflected in the Table of
Common Indicators Required for Surveillance (TCIRS).

7/ Some financing data are available in the quarterly report of the Ministry of Finance; comprehensive, detailed data on
financing, are obtained during IMF staff missions only.
8/ The consolidation of the general government does not include many debt-creating operations that
should be recorded as expenditures (or foregone revenues) of the various entities. These are only captured in
disaggregated financing data. When consolidating the financing data, these operations are recorded as negative financing
items, thereby understating the true fiscal position.
9/ State-owned enterprises and banks carry out quasi-fiscal activities (e.g. fuel and electricity subsidies, concessional
loans) that are not reported in budget documents. Defense data excludes grant-financed expenditure. In addition, the
mixture of accounting methods (mainly cash basis for current spending and partial accruals-basis for investment and
capital spending) further distorts fiscal aggregates and creates difficulties for fiscal analysis.
10/ Domestic debt data is produced on a monthly basis, whereas data on external debt is produced on an annual basis.
11/ The consolidation of public debt data in official reports: (i) does not eliminate transactions and reciprocal stock
positions among entities belonging to the same government unit; and (ii) does not include the stock of government
arrears because the data is not available. Debt data received by Fund staff does not include details on the structure of
debt (e.g. currency denomination and maturity composition).
12/ Oil exports by foreign oil companies operating in Egypt are not recorded, and spending in the Egyptian economy by
these companies is included as a foreign exchange inflow in the current account.
13/ Source data for merchandise trade have problems (see www.data-egypt.org). Source data for other current account
items, based on banks’ foreign exchange records, also have weaknesses.
14/ The business register is outdated; the unorganized private sector is largely not covered; no current statistics are
available to track household final consumption expenditures; and no adjustment is made to commercial data on
inventories and consumption of fixed capital. The quarterly GDP series is not well established (undergoes frequent
revisions), and no extensive investigations into the accuracy of the sources is made.
15/ Flows in short-term external debt as per the balance of payments are inconsistent with changes in the stock of shortterm external debt.

Statement by A. Shakour Shaalan, Executive Director for the Arab Republic of Egypt
May 18, 2005

Introductory Background
We thank staff for their work on Egypt. However, the staff report before us does not
do justice in capturing the recent economic developments in the country. Essentially, the
report provides a snapshot of the many reforms that have been introduced since the new
government took office last summer, without reflecting the scope and scale of the efforts
made thus far, especially when gauged against the relatively short time span in which they
were introduced. More importantly, the report makes no attempt to take into account the new
reforms in assessing the economic outlook for the country.
The sharp turnaround in the direction of economic policies since mid-2004 ushers in a
new and more dynamic economy underpinned by reforms in key areas. The measures already
taken, along with those contemplated for implementation, are comprehensive in nature,
including in particular monetary and exchange rate policy, fiscal and financial sector reforms,
and several key structural reforms described by staff as an “aggressive set of reforms” which
the authorities believe will not only fuel higher economic growth but further integrate the
country in the global economy. It is particularly noteworthy that the staff analysis contrasts
sharply with a range of market-based assessments. These are reflected in the strong behavior
of the stock market, the stability of the exchange rate, the narrowing of Egypt’s spread on
external bonds to 83 basis points above comparable Treasuries, the upward revision of the
long-term outlook on local currency from negative to stable by credit rating agencies, as well
as the increased inflows of funds from abroad.
Building on the economic recovery initiated last year, economic growth further
accelerated to 4.8 percent in the first half of 2004/05, on account of strong growth in exports
and some pick up in consumption, while inflation declined significantly to 5.7 percent in
March 2005 and the exchange rate stabilized following the float in January 2003.
Underpinning this recovery and its sustainability is the accelerated pace of economic
reforms. In addition to several reforms in the fiscal area, accomplishments include significant
cuts in tariff rates, accelerated privatization of state enterprises, and time-bound divestiture of
state ownership in the banking and non-banking sectors. The overall stimulus from the
reform is expected to increase growth and expand revenue generating capacity in the medium
term.
Fiscal Policy and Reforms
A major pillar of the reform program is fiscal consolidation as well as a strengthening
of the budget structure. A new income tax law to reduce tax rates, simplify the tax structure,
and render it more transparent is currently being discussed by the People’s Assembly. Under
the proposed new law, tax rates on corporate profits and across sources of personal income
would be unified. While rate reductions would lower revenues in the short run, other

-2-

measures introduced by the legislation, notably the elimination of all exemptions and tax
holidays, in addition to the increase in prices of domestic energy products and electricity
should offset this shortfall. The law also introduces measures to expand the tax base,
including through provisions to encourage the informal economy to legalize its status.
Efforts to increase budget transparency are also underway, most notably through the
inclusion of implicit subsidies in explicit lines in the budget. The authorities are also
intensifying efforts to improve public expenditure management. To this end, a budget
classification that conforms to the GFS Standards will be used for the 2005/06 budget and
work is ongoing to establish a Single Treasury Account. Despite slightly tightened
expenditures, the consolidated fiscal deficit, which includes the budget sector, the National
Investment Bank, the General Authority for the Supply of Commodities, and the Social
Insurance Funds, is expected to widen by 0.6 percent to 3.1 percent of GDP, mainly on
account of reduced revenues from tariffs. Other debt creating operations amount to about
4 percent of GDP. It is well to note that public borrowing related to other debt-creating
operations has been on a declining trend since 2001/02. The authorities intend to further
reduce these expenditures through additional fiscal measures over the next three years.
The staff report contends that the authorities were not prepared to endorse staff
recommendations for a multi-year fiscal consolidation strategy. There must have been a
misunderstanding as the Minister of Finance clearly indicated to me that this was not the
case. The budget proposal for 2005/06 (fiscal year beginning July 1) was not ready by midFebruary when the mission visited Egypt. Subsequently, the proposed budget for the year
was submitted to the People’s Assembly and is based on a multi-year framework which aims
at reducing the budget deficit to half its present level, excluding the Social Insurance Funds.
Debt Sustainability Analysis
No one can doubt the usefulness of debt sustainability analyses as an important
diagnostic tool in identifying debt problems and addressing them in a timely manner. An
important, or even crucial, input in such analysis is the set of assumptions underlying the
medium-term debt projections. The authorities are well aware that the level of net domestic
public debt is on the high side and is to be reduced in the medium term, particularly in view
of the cost of the planned financial sector reforms. The external debt is not vulnerable even
under adverse scenarios, in view of the adequate level of reserves in relation to short term
foreign debt and the strong balance of payments position. But the staff’s view is unduly
reserved when they maintain there is “no major vulnerability”.
The authorities have difficulty in accepting the debt projections. A comparison of
baseline projections of debt contained in last year’s Article IV report shows that without
additional measures to those anticipated, there would be a sharp deterioration in the debt-toGDP ratio by 2008/09. In the report before us, the net public debt-to-GDP ratio in 2004/05 is
now projected to decline from the earlier staff projections. Thus, whereas the projection
made in 2004 indicates a 14 percentage point increase in the debt ratio over the period
2003/04–2008/09, in this year’s staff report, and for the same years, the baseline scenario

-3-

indicates an increase of only 2 percentage points. In view of the above, there appears to be a
flaw in the methodology and/or the assumptions underlying the projections that needs to be
addressed.
The adjustment scenario, assuming an annual one percentage point decline, allows for
the debt ratio to fall to sustainable levels, even though the assumptions underlying the staff
projections suffer from a number of shortcomings. First, the rate of growth going forward is
assumed to remain below 5 percent because it is constrained, as staff put it, by the budget
deficit and the high debt. Second, privatization proceeds, the major part of which will be used
to reduce the stock of debt, are not taken into account in the projections. Finally, the impact
of the far-reaching reforms that have taken place, and those being readied for
implementation, are not explicitly taken into account in the debt ratio calculations.
Addressing these shortcomings in the projections should reduce the debt ratios further.
Monetary, Exchange Rate, and External Sector Issues
As Directors may recall, the Egyptian pound was pegged to the dollar, within a
trading band of 3 percent around the central bank rate until January 2003 when the pound
was permitted to float with no pre-announced path for the exchange rate. However, owing to
the pressures on the rate and in the absence of complete flexibility, a parallel market emerged
as not all current account transaction demands were met by the banking system. Over time,
the parallel market and the banking rates converged, and in December 2004 an official
interbank market with no exchange restrictions was launched. Since then, Egypt has
successfully floated the pound without intervention from the central bank. Trading activity in
the interbank market has surged since its launching, and has now stabilized in terms of
volume and portfolio composition. Consequently, the exchange rate stabilized, and even
appreciated in early 2005. The difference between the interbank exchange rate and the central
bank rate has been consistently below 2 percent. Although the authorities clearly informed
the staff that they will allow market forces to determine the exchange rate, staff insists on
encouraging them to tolerate fluctuations. This is needless advice which imparts the idea that
the authorities were planning to intervene to prevent potential fluctuations, which is not the
case.
While the road to attaining a freely floating rate was at times bumpy, the
establishment of a freely floating exchange rate system represents a major accomplishment
that this Board has been calling for over the years. Since the float, foreign exchange reserves
have increased to more than US$18 billion (equivalent to 7.5 months of imports),
underpinned by a healthy surplus on the current account with exports continuing to benefit
from the real depreciation of the pound that took place during the past two years. The balance
of payments is in a strong position and all indications point to a resilient continuation of this
trend. Further on the external sector, export surrender requirements, which were introduced
during the transition to a freely floating rate, have been abolished. The long overdue
acceptance of obligations under Article VIII, Sections 2, 3, and 4 was communicated to the
Fund earlier this year.

-4-

The authorities are committed to a monetary policy framework that promotes price
stability. The central bank has been receiving technical assistance from the Fund, the
European Central Bank and donor countries to establish a robust infrastructure to this end.
The central bank has tightened monetary policy in the second half of 2004 largely in
preparation for launching the float. While it is true that pressures on prices were emerging,
these reflected the increases in domestic prices of energy and electricity, the pass-through
effect of the exchange rate depreciation, as well as the global spike in commodity prices. The
staff attributes the pressure on prices to loose monetary policy and further add that the
monetary tightening of the second half of 2004 was insufficient, and that until December
2004, no indications of lower prices appeared on the horizon. That is not surprising. Even if
price pressures had emanated from the accommodative policy stance, the transmission from
the policy to prices is not instantaneous. After peaking in October to over 12 percent,
inflation eased considerably in the first two months of 2005, but the staff refer to that
casually. Following the return of the mission the CPI fell further to 5.7 percent in March
2005, largely on account of the fading impact of the depreciation. These developments in the
CPI rate certainly point to the higher probability that the increase in prices last year was more
depreciation-related.
It is well to note that, with real interest rates now positive and with the central bank
absorbing sizable amounts of incremental liquidity from the system, the proposed additional
tightening of monetary policy suggested by staff was, and still is, not warranted. Growth in
private sector credit has remained sluggish. While this may reflect the lingering effects of
credit excesses experienced in the late 1990s and an excessively cautious lending stance by
commercial banks, the slow recovery in private sector credit is of concern to the authorities,
who have undertaken a series of financial sector reforms to accelerate the recovery of private
sector activity.
The authorities are advancing firmly towards an inflation targeting framework for
monetary policy. To this end, the central bank has taken steps on two parallel fronts. The first
focuses on enhancing the design and focus of its monetary policy, including, as referred to by
staff, through introducing additional instruments to its toolkit such as reverse repurchase
operations, and developing in-house capability to devise and implement, as mentioned
earlier, a coherent monetary policy framework. The second front focuses on improving the
construction of key inflation measures, namely the consumer price and the wholesale or
producer price indices, through technical assistance from the Fund and other national
statistical agencies.
Financial Sector Reforms
To reduce the size of the public sector and enhance the role of the private sector, the
authorities have embarked on an ambitious and comprehensive financial sector reform plan
to be completed over a five-year span. The cornerstone of this reform agenda is a major
public sector restructuring in the banking and insurance sectors. The authorities disagree with
staff’s contention on the lack of specifics regarding the modalities and time frame for
implementation of financial sector reforms. Indeed, the reform process is far from ad-hoc and

-5-

is guided by a well thought out master plan that addresses specific tasks with defined target
dates. This plan has been reviewed and endorsed by the World Bank along with a number of
renowned international bankers, lawyers and restructuring specialists. The program is now in
the implementation phase and ahead of schedule. Specifically, the reform strategy is framed
to methodically and systematically address three key issues: (i) strengthening the banking
system through consolidation and privatization of smaller joint venture and public sector
banks, (ii) restructuring of public sector banks, including through recapitalization, and
(iii) resolution of the problem of non-performing loans (NPLs).
Main accomplishments to date include the completion of four merger and/or sale
transactions of joint venture banks with nine more transactions expected by end-2005, as well
as the initiation of the privatization process of Bank of Alexandria under the supervision of
an international audit firm whose terms of reference conform to the IAS standards. With
respect to restructuring, an international team of expertise is in place to evaluate the loan
portfolios of public sector banks and assess their risk profiles, under the supervision of the
Banking and Restructuring Unit (BRU) of the central bank and in collaboration with the
European Union. The European Central Bank has also been actively involved in the
restructuring of banking supervision at the central bank through a project that it describes as
the largest in its history.
With respect to funding the recapitalization needs of the public sector banks, the
central bank is contemplating the activation of a US$2 billion guarantee facility under the
supplemental agreement with the U.S. Treasury to partly finance the recapitalization. The
World Bank has also been solicited to coordinate part of the international funding to be
raised from donor countries and agencies, as well as assist in setting the mechanisms and
timing of the recapitalization process with a view of linking recapitalization to the resolution
of NPLs.
Regarding NPLs, a monitoring unit was established in the central bank, with
counterpart units in public sector banks. A number of very large cases have been resolved,
resulting in the successful rescheduling of over 26 percent of private sector NPLs with public
sector banks. Consequently, the central bank initiated a new comprehensive program for
resolving conflicts between borrowers and banks which was approved by the central bank
board and communicated to the market. In its initial stage, the program targets 246 borrowers
with over LE 100 million each and comprising 55 percent of NPLs in the public sector. The
Arbitration Committees to oversee the documentation and procedures for this complex
process have already been established. Additionally, target dates have been set for the
resolution of all NPLs in public sector banks within 18 months, the progress of which is
being monitored on a quarterly basis by the BRU of the central bank.
In the insurance sector, the plan aims to expand private sector participation, including
through privatization of one of four state-owned insurance companies. Other measures are
underway to develop the mortgage market, deepen the capital market, and strengthen
financial regulation and supervision. These measures represent an important initiative to
stimulate private sector growth.

-6-

Structural Reforms and Other Issues
The government has stepped up its privatization program while also modifying its
approach in privatizing state-owned companies by offering these companies for sale before
their restructuring is completed. The sale price therefore reflects the commitment of the
buyer to future investment in the company and assumption of its liabilities, including its
workforce. Under this approach, the government is relieved of the substantial investment
costs typically incurred to restructure these companies prior to their sale. Between July 2004
and April 2005, a total of 22 companies had been privatized, yielding approximately LE 3.3
billion in proceeds—which exceed the combined proceeds of the past four years. The
majority of these proceeds will be used to reduce the stock of government debt. It should be
pointed that total employment in state-owned enterprises has been reduced drastically from
1.3 million workers to 400 thousand workers since the privatization process began in 1991.
As regards the trade and the regulatory regimes, these have been liberalized
considerably with the implementation of tariff reforms in September 2004. The weighted
average tariff rate was reduced from 14.6 percent to 9.1 percent, with the biggest cuts
effected on imports of raw and intermediate industrial products. The tariff structure was
simplified and rendered more transparent by reducing the number of ad valorem tariff rates
from 27 to 6. Various exemptions were removed and all export taxes, as well as several
service fees and import surcharges, were eliminated. The trade system was rendered more
business friendly by removing sources of discretionary determination of custom rates on
industrial and non-industrial imports. These tariff reductions are only the first step to further
reductions in tariff levels. Customs administration reforms aimed at simplifying the system
have been underway for some time.
Egypt has also met some important milestones with respect to data issues. In January
2005, Egypt formally subscribed to the IMF Special Data Dissemination System (SDDS).
Additionally, the authorities participated in a Data ROSC in 2003, the recommendations of
which are currently being adopted by the relevant authorities, with technical assistance from
the Fund. Specifically, the authorities have recognized the shortcomings in the balance of
payments statistics, particularly in recording FDI inflows, and in their price statistics. The
authorities have requested Fund assistance in these two areas, given the importance of FDI
flows to the oil and gas sector in Egypt, and in view of their efforts to move to a full fledged
inflation targeting regime over a two-year span. The government has a heightened awareness
of the importance of improving the country’s statistical base to keep up with the pace of its
reforms and to support its ambitious reform agenda. Work on this aspect is underway.
Finally, the authorities recognize the challenges that lie ahead in sustaining the pace
of economic reforms to reinvigorate the domestic economy and stimulate private and foreign
investment. The accomplishments thus far have instilled a renewed sense of confidence in the
economy and could act as an impetus for further far-reaching reforms to address the
ambitious agenda. I would like to conclude by expressing our gratitude to the Fund for the
provision of valuable technical assistance in support of the reform effort.

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2005 Article IV Consultation with the
Arab Republic of Egypt
On May 18, 2005, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded the
Article IV consultation with the Arab Republic of Egypt.1
Background
The direction of economic policies in Egypt changed sharply in 2004 with the appointment of a
pro-reform cabinet led by Prime Minister Nazif. The new economic team moved aggressively
on key structural reforms in the areas of trade, taxes, and subsidies, and launched plans to
restructure the financial system, privatize most state companies, modernize the fiscal
accounts, and strengthen monetary policy. Thus far, the authorities have sold their stake in 17
nonfinancial companies and two financial entities. In January 2005, Egypt subscribed to the
IMF’s Special Data Dissemination Standard (SDDS) and accepted the obligations of Article
VIII, Sections 2, 3, and 4 of the IMF’s Articles of Agreement.
The economic recovery gained steam in 2004. Driven by strong growth in exports of goods
and services, real GDP advanced by 4.8 percent in the first half of 2004/05 (July-December).
Confidence has rebounded, as reflected in the surge in the stock market and the recent
appreciation in the pound. Egypt made the transition to a unified, flexible exchange rate regime
in December 2004 with the establishment of a formal interbank market for foreign exchange

1

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies.
On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the
Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the
Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the
country's authorities.

-2and the elimination of the surrender requirement. Favorable trends in the balance of payments
have contributed to the orderly functioning of the market since its inception.
Egypt’s external position has strengthened further. All foreign exchange generating activities
exhibited robust growth during 2004. The surplus in the external current account rose to
4.4 percent of GDP in 2003/04, and is expected to be slightly higher in 2004/05. This strength
reflects improved competitiveness stemming from the real depreciation of the pound since
2001, as well as other external factors, such as higher oil prices and higher Suez Canal traffic.
Strong current account flows enabled banks to strengthen their net foreign asset position; the
Central Bank of Egypt (CBE) also took advantage of market conditions to build up its reserve
position. Total external debt remained stable at about US$29 billion (31 percent of GDP) at
end-2004.
Monetary policy was tightened in 2004, but not by enough to contain inflation at single digit
rates. Annual CPI inflation (12-month rate) stayed close to 12 percent for most of the year.
With nominal interest rates remaining in the 10–13 percent range, real interest rates were
close to, or below, zero throughout 2004. Recently released data shows a decline in consumer
and wholesale prices in the first two months of 2005, bringing 12-month rates of inflation into
single digits.
Total government borrowing in 2003/04 was 6.6 percent of GDP, due in part to the deficit of
the general government, which was 2.5 percent of GDP (unchanged from 2002/03). As in
previous years, however, most of the borrowing (4.1 percent of GDP) was related to other
debt-creating operations of the government captured in the official financing data but not
included in the published measure of the deficit. Over half of those operations were related to
transactions of the National Investment Bank (NIB). Gross public debt reached a peak of 112
percent of GDP in June 2004, but government deposits with banks grew at a faster pace,
reaching 46 percent of GDP by end-2003/04. Net public debt was LE 312 billion in June 2004
(65.7 percent of GDP). The cost and maturity structure of government debt, and the implied
vulnerabilities, have not deteriorated.
The credit excesses of the late-1990s have continued to weigh heavily on banks, hindering
their ability to contribute to the recovery. Bank credit to the private sector declined again in real
terms in 2004, and most of the recent expansion in banks’ domestic claims has been to the
government. Nonperforming loans rose to over 25 percent of total loans in September 2004,
compared to 20 percent in June 2003.
In the period ahead, external conditions are expected to remain favorable, and the recovery is
likely to firm. Preliminary data suggest a continuation of recent trends in government borrowing
in 2004/05. This outlook implies a small increase in the general government deficit on account
of lower customs and nontax revenues, and no change in the level of other debt-creating
operations. Net public debt is expected to rise to LE 350 billion by June 2005. Presidential
elections by direct popular vote are scheduled for September 2005.
Executive Board Assessment
Directors welcomed the clear change in the direction of economic policies in Egypt since the
2004 consultation. They commended the authorities on their comprehensive economic reform
program and the impressive achievements to date. Directors welcomed the priority being
attached to modernizing the public sector and to reducing government interference in market

-3mechanisms. They welcomed the decisive measures taken in the areas of customs tariffs,
taxes, and subsidies, the ambitious programs of privatization and financial sector reform, and
the improvements in transparency. Directors considered that these policy achievements have
increased market confidence. They also noted the strengthening of the externally-driven
recovery, as well as the positive developments in the foreign exchange market and the recent
good news on the inflation front.
Notwithstanding the substantial progress attained since mid-2004, Directors noted that the
challenges ahead to build a dynamic, private sector-driven economy in Egypt remain
considerable. They noted that output growth remains below the minimum required to absorb
labor force growth, the financial sector is weak, and government borrowing and debt are still
high, while acknowledging that the structure of Egypt’s public debt makes it less vulnerable to
exchange rate and interest rate shocks. Directors encouraged the authorities to sustain the
current pace of structural reform while pursuing fiscal consolidation and a prudent monetary
policy. These policies would help bring about the robust responses of private investment and
output growth that are needed to reduce unemployment and poverty. Directors were
encouraged by the authorities’ awareness of these challenges and their commitment to
implement the reforms necessary to address them.
Directors congratulated the authorities on the successful unification of the exchange rate.
In particular, they applauded the disappearance of the parallel market premium, which has
removed a serious distortion from the economy, and the launching of the interbank market for
foreign exchange. Directors also welcomed Egypt’s acceptance of the obligations of Article
VIII, Sections 2, 3 and 4. They noted that a market-determined, flexible exchange rate would
be beneficial for foreign investment, increase the economy’s resilience to shocks, and improve
macroeconomic management. Directors welcomed the authorities’ commitment to continue to
let the exchange rate be determined by market forces and to tolerate short-term fluctuations in
the rate.
Directors recognized that the Central Bank of Egypt (CBE) has continued work to strengthen
the monetary policy framework over the past year. They encouraged the CBE to intensify
these efforts, and to continue developing a cohesive and credible monetary policy framework
that effectively anchors inflation expectations in the context of a flexible exchange rate, and
that relies on a proactive interest rate policy. In this context, the importance of strengthening
central bank independence was stressed. Many Directors also pointed to the shortcomings
with the price indices in Egypt and highlighted the difficulties these posed for assessing the
monetary policy stance and for improving monetary policy formulation. Directors therefore
urged the authorities to intensify efforts to produce more reliable price statistics.
While the conduct of monetary policy has improved during 2004, Directors were of the view
that, in the near term, monetary policy needs to be more forward-looking and provide better
guidance to the market, including with a well-understood nominal anchor. In this regard, a
number of Directors encouraged the central bank to communicate more clearly its short-term
monetary policy strategy, including by making periodic announcements about the general
direction of monetary policy. These actions would also enhance the credibility and
transparency of the central bank and help anchor inflationary expectations while the monetary
policy framework is being strengthened. Directors therefore welcomed the central bank’s
intention to improve its communications policy. They underscored that monetary policy should
continue to focus on achieving low inflation, and encouraged the authorities to remain vigilant
with a view to adapting monetary conditions as necessary.

-4Directors welcomed the authorities’ focus on fiscal reform in their overall policy agenda. In
particular, they praised the decisive actions taken during 2004 in the areas of tariff reform,
income tax reform, and subsidies, and welcomed the plans being developed to increase the
transparency of subsidies and improve tax administration. Directors also welcomed the
ongoing efforts to modernize Egypt’s budget and improve treasury cash management.
Directors agreed that the latter reforms were necessary conditions for an efficient control of
government expenditure and would improve the measurement of the fiscal balance. However,
most Directors noted that these reforms by themselves would not result in lower government
spending or borrowing unless supplemented with concrete expenditure-reducing measures,
such as pruning subsidies and the government wage bill.
Directors emphasized that implementing a multi-year strategy of fiscal consolidation that
lowers total government borrowing and places public debt on a firmly declining path would be
crucial for achieving a robust response from private investment and growth. Directors also
noted that the fiscal costs of the financial sector reform, which can be significant, further
strengthen the case for sizable medium-term fiscal consolidation. They therefore welcomed
the authorities’ commitment to set ambitious deficit-reduction targets using a multi-year
framework. However, as the official deficit accounts for only a fraction of total government
borrowing, a few Directors suggested setting specific targets on government borrowing to
ensure that government debt follows a declining path.
Directors indicated that effective control over all government spending is necessary to design
an efficient fiscal consolidation strategy. Many Directors also attached importance to reducing
off-budget outlays and integrating them into the budget. In this regard, they noted that bringing
the investment budget under the full control of the Ministry of Finance would strengthen control
over government spending over the medium term. Directors encouraged the authorities to
make the necessary institutional changes, including those affecting the National Investment
Bank, a priority of Egypt’s public sector reform.
Directors commended the progress made in strengthening the macroeconomic database
during 2004 and praised Egypt’s subscription to the Special Data Dissemination Standard
(SDDS). Directors were pleased to learn that the authorities are turning their attention to
improving the quality of statistics, noting that the country’s economic data continue to suffer
from a number of deficiencies. Directors encouraged the authorities to improve coordination
among agencies and to implement the methodological improvements suggested in the 2003
Data ROSC. In this connection, they noted that priority should be given to improving the fiscal
accounts, price statistics, and the balance of payments.
Directors strongly endorsed the financial sector reform and privatization programs launched by
the government, which focus on strengthening the banking system through consolidation and
privatization of small joint venture and public sector banks; restructuring of public sector banks,
including through recapitalization; and resolution of the problem of non-performing loans.
They were encouraged that the process encompasses key goalposts with defined target dates,
and encouraged the authorities to implement the program fully and to adhere to the envisaged
time frame. Directors supported the authorities’ efforts to obtain a diagnosis of the financial
position of state banks, noting that an estimate of their potential recapitalization needs would
be critical for the success of the program and efficient fiscal consolidation.
Directors welcomed the relaunching of Egypt’s privatization program. They noted that the
sales finalized since late 2004 and the public listing of companies up for sale in 2005 attested

-5to the government’s commitment to the program. Directors encouraged the authorities to
closely adhere to their targets, and to incorporate the proceeds expected from the divestitures
in a medium-term fiscal framework. Directors welcomed the authorities’ decision to channel all
privatization proceeds through the Ministry of Finance, and to allocate the bulk of the proceeds
to retiring government debt.
Directors applauded the September 2004 reform of Egypt’s tariff regime, and encouraged the
authorities to consider further cuts in import tariffs as well as streamlining the exemptions and
duty relief schemes not addressed by last year’s reform. More generally, Directors encouraged
the authorities to continue forging ahead with structural reforms that create employment
opportunities and help alleviate poverty, including reforms to labor market legislation.
Directors noted that external vulnerability is low, and that the medium-term outlook for Egypt’s
balance of payments remains favorable. They were of the view that the ongoing development
of Egypt’s tourism potential and vast gas resources bodes well for Egypt’s balance of
payments over the medium term. Several Directors pointed to weaknesses in the official
estimates of Egypt’s balance of payments, noting that those weaknesses affect the authorities’
ability to assess cyclical macroeconomic conditions and to undertake timely policy responses.
Directors welcomed the authorities’ resolve to address these issues.
Directors welcomed the increase in the transparency of economic policies in Egypt. They took
note of the authorities’ intentions to make further progress in the area of transparency.
