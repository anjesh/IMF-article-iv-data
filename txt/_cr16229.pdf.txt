IMF Executive Board Concludes 2016 Article IV Consultation with the
Russian Federation
On June 29, 2016, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded the
Article IV consultation1 with the Russian Federation.
The Russian economy contracted by 3.7 percent in 2015 due to falling oil prices and the quasi
closure of international financial markets to Russian entities. The economic contraction is
nonetheless shallower than previous recessions as a stronger external position and the
authorities’ economic package—a flexible exchange rate regime, banking sector capital and
liquidity injections, limited fiscal stimulus, and regulatory forbearance—cushioned the shocks,
helped restore confidence and stabilized the financial system.
Lower oil prices and needed fiscal adjustment will keep the economy in recession in 2016 with
an expected decline in real GDP of 1.2 percent. The negative output gap and the lack of
aggregate demand pressures are expected to lower CPI inflation to 6.6 percent at end–2016.
Growth is expected to resume in 2017 and reach 1 percent, as domestic demand slowly recovers
on the back of easing financial conditions and pent up demand. With adverse demographics, and
barring significant structural reforms that increase productivity growth, potential growth is likely
to be at around 1½ percent over the medium term. A fall in oil prices is the main risk to the
outlook.
Executive Board Assessment2

1

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with members, usually
every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial information, and discusses with officials
the country's economic developments and policies. On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which
forms the basis for discussion by the Executive Board.
2

At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the Board, summarizes the views of
Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the country's authorities. An explanation of any qualifiers
used in summings up can be found here: http://www.imf.org/external/np/sec/misc/qualifiers.htm

Directors observed that the authorities’ flexible and effective policy response has cushioned the
economy from the dual shocks of lower oil prices and sanctions. At the same time, the Russian
economy will need to adjust to the challenge of persistently lower oil prices by reducing its
dependence on oil and energy exports over the medium term. They stressed that structural
reforms will be essential to leverage the current competitive exchange rate to boost long-term
potential growth.
Directors encouraged the authorities to undertake the necessary fiscal adjustment anchored on a
credible medium-term plan. In this context, they noted the authorities’ large fiscal adjustment
effort planned for 2016, and considered that an adjustment based on quality and permanent
measures that safeguard growth-enhancing expenditure would have been preferable. They agreed
that reintroducing the three-year budgeting framework in the 2017 budget would be critical to
reduce policy uncertainty and provide greater clarity over future fiscal measures. Directors also
emphasized that a credible fiscal rule would support medium-term sustainability. They also
noted that a parametric pension reform has become urgent to reap the fiscal benefits in a timely
manner.
Directors commended the authorities for implementing policies that were helpful in bringing
down inflation. Given the negative output gap and little evidence of demand-side pressures, they
considered that monetary policy normalization would be appropriate. However, they cautioned
that the pace of easing should be gradual, given past strong links between volatile oil prices, the
exchange rate, and inflation.
Directors welcomed the authorities’ success in stabilizing the financial system. They also
welcomed the completion of the government’s capital support program and the lifting of most
regulatory forbearance measures. Directors encouraged the authorities to implement the main
findings of the Financial Sector Assessment Program by improving the resolution framework to
minimize the use of public funds, conducting a review of banks’ asset quality and using its
findings to strengthen banks’ capital, and further improving supervision and regulation. They
stressed the need to deepen and diversify the financial sector by continuing the privatization
program, pursuing the closure of weak banks, and encouraging the involvement of the private
sector in bank resolution.
Directors noted that Russia has the opportunity to diversify its economy as a result of a more
competitive exchange rate. They emphasized the importance of reforms to facilitate the
reallocation of resources to the non-energy tradable sector. In this regard, trade integration
initiatives to widen the scope of market access for non-energy exporters would be important.
Directors also saw scope for accelerating institutional reforms and further enhancing the business
climate. They highlighted the need to strengthen contract enforcement and the protection of
property rights, improve labor market policies, and invest in innovation and infrastructure.

RUSSIAN FEDERATION
STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2016 ARTICLE IV CONSULTATION
June 14, 2016

KEY ISSUES AND RECOMMENDATIONS
Context. Despite a flexible and effective policy response that helped restore confidence
and stabilize the financial system, the decline in oil prices and sanctions led to a sharp
contraction of economic activity in 2015. The recession is extending into 2016 due to
lower oil prices, fiscal consolidation and still tight financial conditions. The banks’ capital
support program came to completion while most regulatory forbearance measures were
lifted. Medium-term prospects remain subdued due to long-standing structural
bottlenecks in addition to adverse population dynamics and the impact of sanctions on
productivity and investment.
Near-term macroeconomic policy mix. The fiscal policy adjustment in 2016 is
procyclical and a smoother adjustment would have been preferable. Monetary policy
normalization could resume at a prudent pace given the decline in inflation and inflation
expectations. Financial sector policies should focus on implementing the main findings of
the Financial Sector Assessment Program (FSAP) by improving the resolution framework,
conducting a review of banks’ asset quality, and further strengthening supervision and
regulation.
Medium-term policy challenges. Policies need to address the challenge of persistently
lower oil prices. Fiscal policy should be guided by a multi-year adjustment program
based on quality and durable measures. The financial policy framework needs further
strengthening, per the FSAP recommendations, to limit potential sources of macrofinancial risks and foster the financial sector’s contribution to medium-term growth.
Finally, structural reforms remain essential to leverage the more competitive exchange
rate and raise productivity and investment, while diversifying the sources of economic
growth.

RUSSIAN FEDERATION

CONTEXT: NAVIGATING THE CHALLENGE OF
PERSISTENTLY LOWER OIL PRICES
1.
An effective policy response has cushioned
the economy from the dual shocks of lower oil
prices and sanctions. The 45 percent decline in oil
prices between 2014 and 2015 and the continued quasi
closure of international financial markets to Russian
entities depressed economic conditions. The economic
contraction is nonetheless shallower than previous
recessions as a stronger external position and the
authorities’ economic package—a flexible exchange
rate regime, banking sector capital and liquidity
injections, limited fiscal stimulus, and regulatory
forbearance—cushioned the shocks, helped restore confidence and stabilized the financial system.
2.
The anti-crisis measures introduced in December 2014 have been phased out or not
renewed. The government’s capital support program was completed and most regulatory
forbearance measures were lifted. The temporary and limited fiscal stimulus in 2015 supported
growth. Normalization of monetary policy proceeded for most of 2015, following the emergency
650bp rate hike in December 2014, as confidence improved and inflation came down. Finally, the
CBR has progressively raised the cost of its FX facilities while banks proceeded to repay about half of
their FX borrowing.
3.
The external adjustment has been progressing rapidly. In spite of falling oil prices, the
current account improved in 2015 due to import contraction, improvement in the services’ balance
deficit, and a narrowing of the income account deficit. Despite the ruble’s significant adjustment
towards a lower equilibrium, the response of non-energy exports has so far been limited to a few
specific sectors (Annex II and Box 1). Meanwhile, external deleveraging, triggered by sanctions, has
reduced external private debt by USD 176bn over the past two years. Finally, capital outflows
declined in 2015 to half their 2014 level, reflecting the return of confidence and a reduction in
exchange rate pressures.
4.
Increased headwinds have delayed the recovery (Figure 1). After some signs of
improvements in mid–2015, the renewed slump in oil prices throughout the second half of 2015
dampened economic prospects. As a result, the federal government introduced new spending cuts
to the 2016 budget while the ruble depreciation led the CBR to pause its monetary easing in August
2015. Given the fragile economic situation, the banking sector has remained weak although financial
stability concerns have subsided.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

RUSSIAN FEDERATION

Box 1. The Economy’s Adjustment to the Current Recession
Russia’s economic adjustment to the oil price
shock has been smoother than past recession
episodes. The 30 percent cumulative deterioration
in the terms-of-trade has been larger than the 2009–
10 episodes. Yet, real GDP contraction in 2015 has
been milder than in 2009 amid a much more
pronounced real exchange rate adjustment (REER).
Stronger real wage flexibility, lower increases in
unemployment, and higher profits in the
tradable sector have helped cushion the impact
of the oil price shock. The flexible exchange rate
and the tight income policies of the government
facilitated the downward adjustment of real wages,
which fell by 9 percent in 2015, compared to a
3 percent decline in 2009. As a result,
unemployment remained broadly stable at around 6
percent, in contrast to 2009, when unemployment
increased to more than 8 percent. The fall in real
wage led to a rebalancing of national income in
favor of corporate profits, more noticeably in the
non-oil basic commodities’ sectors.
A more competitive REER supported import
competing industries and to a lesser extent some
exports. In contrast with 2009–10, volumes of some
non-oil exports, such as chemicals and agriculture
products, increased during 2014–15, outperforming
domestic market sales. In addition, domestic sales of
goods and services (in real terms) fell less than
domestic demand, suggesting some import
substitution as a result of expenditure switching.
Agriculture and food as well as chemicals, rubber
and plastics showed the best performance among
tradable goods.
Sustaining these trends will be key to support
diversification. Domestic sales of goods and services outperformed domestic demand in each of the
episodes of REER decline since the late 1990s, increasing the share of domestic goods in total
demand by 5–6 percentage points. However, these gains were reversed as the REER rebounded.

RECENT DEVELOPMENTS
5.
The rebound in oil prices in the first half of 2016 has improved the short-term
economic outlook. Brent prices reached a low of USD 26 per barrel in January 2016 before staging a
recovery that is extending into Q2 2016, with oil prices averaging USD 47 per barrel in May. There
have been some tentative signs of economic improvements in specific sectors but broad signs are
not yet widespread. Industrial production has stopped declining sequentially although PMI suggests
continued weaknesses in the manufacturing sector while the services sector activity seems to be
gathering strength. A negative output gap, lower-than-expected exchange rate pass through,
declining international food prices, and tight income polices have contributed to lowering inflation,
which reached 7½ percent in April, down from 16½ percent a year before.
6.
The banking system remains weak but stable. The overall capital adequacy ratio resumed
its declining trend on the back of low profitability and anemic credit growth.1 Credit quality
continues to worsen, with reported NPLs reaching 9.2 percent of total loans in Q1 2016. Despite the
challenging environment, the flow of deposits is increasing, liquidity in both rubles and foreign
exchange (FX) has improved, and there are no signs of increased dollarization. CBR has continued
closing banks, most of them small, in many cases because they are weak or not in compliance with
regulations (including under AML/CFT legislation).

OUTLOOK AND RISKS
7.
Lower oil prices and tighter policies will
keep the economy in recession in 2016 while the
recovery and medium-term prospects remain
modest (Figure 2). Real GDP is expected to decline
by 1.2 percent in 2016, as consumption adjusts to
lower real wages and tighter credit conditions while
investment remains weak. The negative output gap
and the lack of aggregate demand pressures are
expected to lower CPI inflation to 6.6 percent at end–
2016 and 5.2 percent at end–2017. Growth is
expected to resume in 2017 and reach 1 percent, as
domestic demand slowly recovers on the back of
easing financial conditions and pent-up demand. Nonetheless, private consumption and investment
are likely to remain subdued over the medium-term against a background of lower-than-trend credit

growth from a weak banking system and deleveraging, dampened oil prices, and tight fiscal policy.
Finally, with adverse demographics, and barring significant structural reforms that increase
productivity growth, potential growth is likely to be at around 1½ percent over the medium term.
8.
Risks remain significant but existing buffers will help limit adverse effects. The main
risks to the Russian economy are a further decline in oil prices, an intensification of geopolitical
tensions, and a weaker banking system for longer (RAM, Annex III). The materialization of these risks
would deepen the recession and, if residents’ confidence is destabilized, increase balance of
payments pressures. Although most corporates have enough foreign exchange to cover their shortterm external debt obligations and have natural hedges against exchange rate risks, further
deleveraging could reduce investment and thus potential output.2 Moreover, the absence of credible
measures to consolidate public finances in the medium-term could foster uncertainty and further
limit investment and growth. Weak growth would also weigh on the recovery of the financial sector.
However, the banking sector is relatively small as a share of GDP. Also, Russia has a floating
exchange rate, large official foreign exchange reserves, a positive net international investment
position of about 20 percent of GDP, and a current account surplus.3 In addition, balance sheet
currency mismatches seem low and do not impose a significant constraint on exchange rate
flexibility. More importantly, public sector debt is low, financing needs moderate, and should it be
needed in a tail event, the National Wealth Fund (NWF)—with liquid assets worth 5 percent of GDP—
could be used as an alternative to finance the deficit.

Authorities’ Views
9.
The authorities broadly agreed with staff’s risk assessment but had a more optimistic
view on the growth prospects. For 2016, the Ministry of Finance expects a much milder contraction
than staff, of 0.2 percent, due in large part to lower fiscal multipliers assumptions and the
expectations of stronger domestic demand. The Ministry of Finance and the CBR considered that the
Russian economy has largely adjusted to the dual shocks of lower oil prices and sanctions while
financial conditions were improving. They pointed out that specific sectors are performing well such
as agriculture and chemicals, benefiting from the ruble depreciation and other government policies.
However, they underscored the risks to the outlook coming from volatile oil prices, a weaker banking
system, and lack of progress in fiscal adjustment. They agreed with staff that in the absence of
structural reforms, growth prospects would remain dim.

2

Staff projections assume that Russian entities will be able to roll-over their external debt at higher roll-over rates
from 2017 (Table 3).
3

International reserves stood at USD368 billion at end-2015, equivalent to 266 percent of the Fund’s basic reserve
adequacy metric, exceeding the adequacy minimum of 150 percent. Taking into account Russia’s vulnerability to
commodity shocks, the adjusted adequacy metric falls to 199 percent of the metric, remaining above the minimum
adequacy threshold (see “Assessing Reserve Adequacy – Specific Proposals” IMF, April 2015). Nonetheless, additional
reserves could be justified given that Russia’s access to international capital markets is impaired.

POLICY DISCUSSIONS
The discussions focused on managing the ongoing adjustment to lower oil prices and the policies
required to ensure a recovery by: (i) anchoring the fiscal adjustment in a credible medium-term plan
and thus avoiding an excessively tight fiscal policy in the short run; (ii) resuming monetary policy
loosening as inflation risks subside to mitigate the fiscal drag and support the recovery; (iii)
strengthening financial sector institutions to better support growth; and (iv) advancing structural
reforms to leverage the more competitive exchange rate and rebalance growth towards non-energy
tradable goods.

A. Fiscal Policy: Designing and Sequencing Fiscal Consolidation
10.
The budget for 2016 targeted a deficit of 3 percent of GDP. The approved budget was
based on oil prices averaging USD 50 per barrel and included a freeze of public sector wages—for a
second year in a row—and a partial indexation of pension benefits to inflation. The subsequent
decline in oil prices in early 2016 led the authorities to implement additional measures to limit the
impact of oil prices on the deficit, including a 10 percent across-the-board cut in non-defense/nonsocial spending. The government also reallocated spending to priority areas under a new “anti-crisis
package”. The deficit is to be financed primarily through a drawdown from the Reserve Fund (RF) and
via privatization receipts from a number of large state-owned companies. Net financing from the
domestic market would amount to only 0.4 percent of GDP while net external financing would be
negligible, after accounting for the USD 1.75bn in Eurobonds that has already been issued.
11.
The authorities announced the goal of balancing the budget by 2020 and then
reintroducing the fiscal rule. The authorities aim to reintroduce the multi-year fiscal framework,
suspended last year, in the 2017 budget. To adjust to the new reality of lower oil prices, they are
considering a broad range of fiscal consolidation measures including pension reform, means-testing
social benefits, postponing investment and improving capital budgeting, cutting subsidies, and
improving tax collection. The 2017 budget and the measures envisaged in the multi-year framework
will be submitted to Parliament in October. Finally, the government is considering reintroducing a
fiscal rule once the fiscal adjustment is completed, based on a fixed oil price of USD40 or USD50 per
barrel depending on the authorities’ assessment of long-term average oil prices, to smooth the
impact of oil price cycles on public finances, domestic demand, and the real exchange rate.
12.
Staff estimates that the fiscal deficit will be slightly larger than budgeted for 2016.
Based on an average Urals oil price of USD 42.2 per barrel, the federal deficit is expected by staff to
reach 3.2 percent of GDP.4 In parallel, the general government deficit is expected to deteriorate from
4

Privatization proceeds from the possible sale of 19.5 percent of the Rosneft’s capital are accounted for in the 2017
budget as a dividend transfer from the holding company Rosneftegaz. Privatization proceeds from the sale of the
government’s stake in other companies are treated as financing. Privatization receipts are excluded from the
calculation of the structural deficit and hence do not affect the assessment of the fiscal stance.

3.5 percent of GDP in 2015 to 3.7 percent of GDP in 2016, as the fall in oil revenues is only partly
offset by a decline in expenditures as a share of GDP. This corresponds to an improvement of the
structural non-oil primary deficit of 1.6 percent of potential GDP, implying a significant fiscal drag on
the economy in 2016.
13.
Given the sizeable deterioration in the oil price outlook compared to last year’s Article
IV, staff agreed that fiscal consolidation was more pressing. However, the economic outlook has
deteriorated since the last Article IV and there remains slack in the economy. Thus, given the
available fiscal space, the flexible exchange rate, and the constraints on monetary policy to offset the
fiscal drag, staff argued that a smaller underlying fiscal adjustment of about 0.7 percent of GDP in
2016 would have been appropriate.5 Furthermore, an adjustment based on better quality measures
would have been preferable to an across-the-board spending cut that could reduce some productive
and needed outlays. Staff also recommended preserving more of the RF as liquidity risks could
materialize (e.g. drop in oil prices, low privatization receipts, and/or a tightening of sanctions), and
instead relying more on debt issuance since public debt is relatively low and there is demand for
domestically-issued government bonds.

integenerational equity by 2020 (Box 2). Staff proposed a menu of measures to be considered by the
authorities (text table). Staff advocated that the consolidation be based on quality measures, with the
lowest multipliers in the short-term to limit the impact on growth (excises and VAT), and look at a
broad range of unproductive spending, leveraging on the initial result of the authorities’ ongoing
expenditure review. To support the fiscal consolidation effort, staff also noted the benefits of
strengthening the financial oversight of government-controlled enterprises, in line with the
recommendations of the 2014 Fiscal Transparency Evaluation for Russia. In addition, reestablishing
the three-year fiscal framework would help reduce policy uncertainty and provide a path to anchor

the adjustment, in light of the risks stemming from the election cycles (Duma in September 2016,
presidential in March 2018) and possible contingent liabilities from the banking system.
15.
Staff noted that parametric pension reform is essential to balance the budget by 2020.
Staff reiterated the pension reform proposals made at the 2015 workshop delivered by IMF experts
which consisted of: (1) increasing and equalizing statutory retirement ages; (2) reducing early
retirement benefits; (3) improving coverage and compliance; (4) curtailing (continuing) pension
benefits for pensioners below (above) the mandatory retirement age; and (5) striving to develop and
preserve private pensions in order to support long-term financing to the economy. Pension reform
that increases retirement age and provides more incentives to stay in the labor force would have the
additonal benefit of easing demographic pressures on labor supply.
16.
Staff argued that a credible fiscal rule would help support medium-term fiscal
sustainability. While the authorities are still considering options for the specific design of their fiscal
rule, staff reiterated its views expressed in the last Article IV Consultation and the accompanying
Selected Issues Paper. In particular, staff noted that a more flexible oil-price rule, which sets an oil
benchmark that incorporates future oil prices in its calculation, as done in Mexico for instance, could
be preferable. This would help avoid suspending the rule when faced with pressures to increase
spending, during an oil price boom, or when market pressures constrain financing, during an oil price
downturn. Staff also noted that to be fully consistent with intergenerational equity, an additional
fiscal adjustment of at least one percent of GDP would be required by 2021.

Authorities’ Views
17.
The authorities agreed with the need for medium-term fiscal consolidation under a
credible fiscal rule. In their view, the decline in oil prices is mainly permanent and thus requires
permanent fiscal adjustment. In contrast to staff, however, they believed that fiscal consolidation is
unlikely to have an adverse impact on short-term economic activity, as fiscal multipliers are assumed
to be low, possibly reflecting a lower estimate of the output gap and tight monetary conditions. They
noted their ongoing efforts to find appropriate consolidation measures in the context of their
comprehensive expenditure review, including means testing of social benefits, and steamlining
inefficient health care spending. They agreed that pension reform is indispensable to reach their
objective of a balance budget by 2020. Moreover they noted that encouraging private pensions
would support the availability of long-term capital, which would be beneficial to the economy. The
authorities agreed that reintroducing a fiscal rule could support fiscal sustainability and emphasized
that a rule based on a fixed oil price would be simpler, more transparent and easier to communicate.
They argued that the reliance on the RF to finance the deficit reflected the still-high cost of domestic
borrowing. In addition, they pointed out to the current complex situation for issuing externally,
where they believe that moral suasion by the US and EU authorities could increase uncertainty and
risk primia. However, they are considering legislative budgetary changes to allow for greater
flexibility in debt issuance to be able to take advantage of better market conditions.

Box 2. Revisions to the Fiscal Anchor Estimate
Given the lower oil price outlook since the last
Article IV consultation, staff has updated its
analysis of long-term fiscal benchmarks for
Russia, consistent with the methodology
presented in “Russia’s Fiscal Framework and the
Oil Price Shock”. For simplicity, this presents the
results for the “real annuity”, which is a constant
real transfer of resources over a fixed period of
time (50 years) after which all resource wealth is
exhausted.
While the impact of projected lower oil prices is
partially offset by a more depreciated exchange
rate, the updated analysis indicates that Russia
would need to reduce its projected non-oil
primary deficits to be consistent with the real
annuity. For example, in the 2015 Article IV, a real
annuity starting in 2021 and amounting to 4.6
percent of GDP was consistent with Russia’s
estimated oil wealth. Lower projected oil prices
have reduced this real annuity to 4.1 percent of
GDP, implying a need for an overall stronger
fiscal effort of about 0.5 percent of GDP by 2021
relative to the original baseline envisaged in the
2015 Article IV consultation.

B. Monetary Policy: Returning to Normalization
18.
Policy rates have remained constant since August 2015 due to inflation risks (Figure 4).
After lowering rates by 600bps during January-August to a new level of 11 percent, the CBR paused
its easing cycle in August to assess the impact of the ruble depreciation on inflation. The renewed
pressures on the exchange rate from lower oil prices at year-end extended the pause, despite the
weak economy and the additional fiscal tightening, with the CBR assessing the balance of risks
skewed towards higher inflation risks. Since the beginning of 2016, the CBR has emphasized
uncertainty over the fiscal policy outlook, reflecting the lack of clarity over government income
policies for 2017. The CBR remains committed to reaching its 4 percent inflation target by end–2017.
19.
Staff recommended resuming normalization of monetary policy at a prudent pace to
support the economy. Inflation has been coming down on a sequential basis and is expected to
continue to decline as a result of the negative output gap and slow nominal wage growth—in the
context of freeze of public sector salaries for a second year in a row and partial pension benefit

indexation. In addition, inflation expectations have continued to come down. Moreover, the
exchange rate is broadly in line with fundamentals (Annex II), limiting further depreciation pressures
that may fuel inflation. And, with headline inflation falling to 7.3 percent in May and unchanged
nominal policy rates, real policy rates have increased. In addition, the monetary stance is tight as the
policy rate is well above estimates of the neutral rate, which on balance suggest the CBR could
resume its easing cycle. However, the pace of easing should be gradual given past strong links
between volatile oil prices, the exchange rate and this inflation, factors that should condition the size
and timing of interest rate cuts. Indeed, an aggressive monetary policy easing could lead to capital
outflows, deposit withdrawals, and possibly destabilizing dollarization. In addition, uncertainty over
the fiscal stance next year calls for a cautious approach to easing. Finally, unexpected policy
tightening in the US and/or capital flow volatility related to concerns over the outlook for China
would further limit CBR’s room to ease (see RAM Annex III).

Authorities’ Views
20.
The authorities agreed that monetary policy normalization should proceed at a
cautious pace. The CBR viewed the weak inflation readings in early 2016 as potentially transitory,
due among other things to falling world food prices. It indicated that its moderately tight monetary
stance was necessary to build credibility as a new inflation targeter and help bring down inflation to
about 5 percent by end–2016 and to target by end–2017. Finally, the CBR argued that lowering
policy rates should be cautious and given the uncertainty over future fiscal policies and still abovetarget inflation expectations, should be undertaken only once more clarity over the drivers of
inflation is ascertained.

C. Macro-Financial: Improving the Institutional Framework to Secure a
Higher Contribution to Growth
21.
The banking system is likely to require additional capital. After adjusting for the lower
quality of restructured loans, misclassifications, and transfer of distressed assets to affiliated offbalance sheet entities, the FSAP assessed that NPLs might be higher than reported by some
3.5 percentage points resulting in a capital shortfall of about 0.5-1 percent of GDP. Under stress
scenarios, the shortfall could reach up to about 4½ percent of GDP.
22.
Macro-financial risks remain as the economy adjusts to lower oil prices (Box 3). Ruble
depreciation has cushioned the revenues of energy exporters from lower oil prices (Figure 6). In
addition, energy companies have remained profitable given that their cost structure is primarily in
rubles and that they are among the lowest-cost producers globally. However, the corporate sector as
a whole shows signs of weaknesses. Debt servicing capacity has been falling, while smaller
companies show weaker returns on assets and higher leverage. At the aggregate level, about half of
corporate debt is denominated in FX. However, FX risks appears contained as corporate net foreign
currency denominated debt to the banking system amounts to 4 percent of GDP while the private
sector’s short-term external assets exceed its short-term liabilities by about USD 65 bn. Most

12

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

RUSSIAN FEDERATION

corporations that borrow externally have natural hedges. Moreover, external borrowing other than
intercompany lending, the part most affected by sanctions and that would not be easily rolled-over
externally, is more than covered by the external assets of corporations. Support to the loss-making
Russian Development Bank (VEB), a non-deposit taking institution, has yet to be fully formalized but
could reach up to 2 percent of GDP over the next few years.
23.
The authorities’ policies continue to support banking system stability. Nearly all the
funds allocated under the 2015 government’s capital support program have been assigned,
amounting to 25 percent of eligible banks’ capital. Participating private banks are raising an
additional 12.5 percent in capital through retained earnings and/or share issuance, as required under
the capital support program. Most regulatory forbearance measures introduced in December
2014 have been lifted, with the exception of continued flexibility in provisioning against loans
restructured during December 2014–15 (Box 4). To offset the impact of the tighter capital definition
and new capital buffers under Basel III, CBR lowered the minimum regulatory CAR from 10 percent to
8 percent, which is in line with minimum Basel III. 6 The introduction of the Basel capital buffers
would allow banks to temporarily run down these new buffers which would be helpful in the current
economic environment, but elevates the importance of strong supervision, including in asset
valuations and risk management. The necessary move to Basel III, by narrowing the eligible capital to
calculate the CAR, has improved the loss absorption capacity of banks’ reported capital. Banks are
less reliant on CBR liquidity but their funding remains short term and segmented by size and
ownership structure.

6

The tighter capital definition is estimated to lower banking system CAR by 0.6 percent of risk weighted assets (RWA).
The new capital buffers are 0.625 percent of RWA for capital conservation and 0.15 percent of RWA for the systemic
surcharge in 2016. These will gradually increase to 2.5 percent and 1 percent, respectively, when fully implemented in
2019. Thus, the effective minimum CAR is reduced temporarily by 0.775 percent of RWA for all banks but will recover
and be higher by 2019.

Box 3. Macro-Financial Linkages from Lower Oil Prices (Continued)
Russia is experiencing the aftershocks of the fall in oil prices through a web of macro-financial
spillovers affecting primarily the following sectors:
Corporate sector. The direct impact on the oil and gas (O&G) industry has been relatively benign
(paragraph 22, Figure 6). Nonetheless, oil prices are positively correlated to leverage and
investment (Figure 7). As a result, oil extraction is expected to decline and gradually affect growth
over the very long-term. Upstream and downstream sectors such as drilling and transportation
(dominated by state-owned companies Transneft and Russian Railways) will also be affected. The
indirect impact of lower oil prices through the large ruble depreciation has been more significant
for unhedged sectors such as real estate and construction where contracts were labeled in FX and
not rolled over when the exchange rate depreciated (Figure 8). Other sectors experiencing some
difficulties include wholesale and retail trade due to low domestic demand and a slowdown in
government spending.
Banking system. Bank lending is rather diversified across sectors without a significant
concentration in the O&G industry—this sector typically borrows externally to take advantage of
lower cost of funding and deeper capital markets (Figure 8). Nonetheless, indirect exposures and
spillovers can be large. The FSAP stress test envisaged two scenarios: (1) a V-shape scenario where
oil prices rebound from a low of USD 19 per barrel, and (2) an L-shape scenario where oil prices
stay lower for longer after falling to USD 25 per barrel. The results show that the banking system
would have capital needs that could at worst top about 4½ percent of GDP in both scenarios. The
weak banking system will contribute to lower investment and growth, while offering little support
to economic diversification. Sensitivity tests for the default of a bank’s five largest corporate
borrowers resulted in capital deficits in 338 banks equivalent to 2 percent of GDP. This rather
severe outcome reflects the high concentration of lending into few borrowers.
Sovereign performance. A fall in oil prices reduces revenues from the O&G sector, although
cushioned by the currency depreciation, leads to a general decline in fiscal receipts from a growth
slowdown, and lowers dividend payments from state-owned enterprises and banks linked to the
O&G industry. Fiscal adjustment via restrictive income policies—wage freezes and low pension
indexation—have impacted consumption while the across-the-board cuts will affect capital
spending. Buffers are being slowly eroded to finance the deficit, with the RF expected to fall to
about 0.2 percent of GDP in 2017, which could necessitate the use of the NWF (5 percent of GDP)
for any subsequent deficit financing, should the authorities decide to continue tapping into their
reserves. The potential future support to banks and VEB could further dent buffers, although the
authorities’ public debt, which stood at 18 percent of GDP in 2015, remains relatively low, is
overwhelmingly denominated in local currency, and has long maturities.

Box 4. Banking Sector Regulatory Forbearance
The authorities introduced temporary forbearance as part of a comprehensive policy package in
December 2014, to help banks avoid regulatory triggers due to the acute ruble depreciation and
volatile securities market prices. The strategy was appropriately combined with intensified supervision,
but transparency in regards to asset quality has suffered.
Forbearance Measures

16

Status

Valuation of securities
Temporary moratorium on recognizing negative
valuation changes for securities to limit the sensitivity
to market risk.

Introduced in December 2014 at October 1st,
2014 prices with a deadline for the measure’s
expiration of July 2, 2015.
Lifted on July 2, 2015.

Valuation of FX items I
Allowing the use of a fixed exchange rate on the
conversion of FX-denominated assets and liabilities that
existed before January 2nd, 2015, to limit the impact of
FX depreciation on all prudential ratios.

Introduced in December 2014 at October 1st,
2014 rates, (39 RUB/USD and 50 RUB/EUR
corresponding to a 25-30 percent below market
rates during the period), with a deadline for the
measure’s expiration of July 1st, 2015. The measure
was extended in May 2015 for the period of July 1st
to October 1st 2015 using new rates (45 RUB/USD
and 52 RUB/EUR corresponding to a 30 percent
below market rates at end-period). The measure was
re-extended in September 2015 for the period of
October 2nd to January 1st, 2016, using new rates
(55 RUB/USD and 64 RUB/EUR corresponding to a
20-25 percent below market rates at end period).
Lifted on January 2, 2016.

Valuation of FX items II
Allowing the use of a fixed exchange rate on the
conversion of FX-denominated assets and liabilities that
existed before January 2nd, 2016, for calculation of large
exposure norms N6 and N21.

Introduced in January 2016 at January 1st 2016 rates
(73 RUB/USD and 80 RUB/EUR but by April 1st, the
RUB had appreciated below these levels and the
measure was therefore not applied by banks at the
end of Q1 2016) with a deadline for the measure’s
expiration of April 1st, 2016.
Lifted on April 2, 2016.

Loan loss provisioning I
An existing forbearance measure in the law allows
flexibility in loan classification and loan-loss
provisioning in extraordinary situations, such as
calamities, wars, etc. Loans affected by the conflict in
Ukraine were eligible for this measure and its
application extended from 1 year to 3 years.

Introduced in November 2014 with a deadline for
expiration of 3 years from the start of the
extraordinary event.

Loan loss provisioning II
Banks were allowed flexibility in loan classification and
loan-loss provisioning of (i) loans that deteriorated
because of economic sanctions and the related
economic conditions; and (ii) loans restructured as of
December 1st, 2014.

Introduced in December 2014 with an expiry date of
July 1st, 2015. The measure was extended in May
2015 until October 1st 2015 and re-extended until
January 1st, 2016. On January 2nd, 2016, the measure
(i) was lifted and (ii) was grandfathered for
performing loans restructured during December
2014-15 that had not been further restructured.

Box 5. Financial Sector Strategy (Continued)
Enhanced Stress testing: It would be advisable to conduct stress tests, including on liquidity by
currency, on a consolidated basis. The current tests are performed on a solo basis and may miss
downstreaming of problematic assets by D-SIBs (which are subject to stricter regulatory
requirements) to unconsolidated subsidiaries. Similarly, liquidity stress tests based on aggregate
asset and liability categories may overlook liquidity shortages in particular currencies.
Asset Quality Reviews (AQR). The design and implementation of an AQR must be credible and
perceived as such by market participants. This is usually achieved through rigorous design,
transparent public disclosure of procedures and results, and engagement of independent thirdparty experts (domestic and international) to conduct and/or oversee the AQR. The experts’ tasks
may include advising on setting scope and methodologies, drafting Terms of Reference (TOR),
and overseeing the conduct of the AQR.
Ahead of the AQR, the authorities should formulate a strategy to address any weaknesses that the
AQR may uncover. The strategy should include a method for assessing banks’ viability on a
forward-looking basis, based on the AQR’s results, and eligibility criteria for banks to receive
public solvency support (from federal funds as outlined below). Undercapitalized but viable banks
should be required to submit time-bound recapitalization plans. For banks that are deemed
unviable, CBR and DIA should make advance preparations for orderly resolution.
The AQR can be conducted in one go or in phases, using a risk-based approach. Two approaches
could be considered or a combination of the two:
 Independent external auditors. Banks are asked to hire independent external auditors (different
from their normal auditors) from a pre-approved CBR list of reputable firms—international
firms for large and complex banks, and local auditors for smaller banks.
 CBR: CBR supervisory staff conducts the AQR and the role of independent external advisors is
elevated to discussing and challenging the results during its conduct. The experts could be
domestic and/or international.
Improving supervision. The FSAP identified five key areas for improvements, including legal
changes:
 The CBR’s relations and interactions with the external auditing profession. Material deficiencies
include lack of power to reject the appointment of an external auditor who has inadequate
independence; inadequate experience or weak professional standards; ability to ensure
rotation of external auditors; and meeting with audit firms to discuss matters pertaining to
supervised institutions.
 Flow of information. There are no requirements for professional service providers, such as
auditors, to notify CBR in advance, or at all, of material information that is relevant to the
soundness and stability of the supervised bank. The onus is therefore on CBR to raise the
relevant question at the right moment to uncover the information it needs. Legal protection of
service providers should be put in place as necessary.







The legal regime for related parties. In assessing connectedness, the concept of economic
linkages was introduced in law already in 2014, but implementation was twice postponed,
lately to January 2017. The regulatory framework does not require that lending to affiliates be
on same terms and conditions as those generally offered to the public. CBR lacks authority to
impose penalties on directors who benefited from favorable conditions.
Management of country and transfer risks. There are no enforceable requirements for risk
policies, processes and limits. CBR’s approval is not required for major acquisition of domestic
nonbank institutions.
Oversight of operational risk. A large part of norms that govern operational risk is in the form
of non-binding recommendations.

Improving the bank resolution framework. The FSAP identified several areas for improvement.
These include: (1) expanding the scope of resolution to cover bank-holding companies; (2)
enhancing CBR powers to facilitate mergers and recapitalization and business transfers, while
ensuring the continuity of critical functions; and (3) introducing shareholder and creditor
safeguards to reduce legal risks. With regards to enhancing CBR’s resolution powers ((2) above), it
is critical to implement legal and operational changes to enhance the effectiveness of Purchase
and Assumption (P&A) transactions, including by removing financing constraints, increasing
flexibility in determining the scope of liabilities to be transferred, and using fair valuation of assets.
In addition, introducing the bail-in tool could reduce the reliance on public funds to recapitalize
banks, but the framework needs to be carefully designed to take into account its implication on
financial stability and authorities’ legal risks stemming from the application of such powers.
For resolution funding, public funds should be restricted to systemic banks and provided with
federal funds or, if temporarily with CBR funds, with an indemnity. The authorities should consider
replacing below-market rate loans with direct capital injection to facilitate a swift return of healthy
resolved banks to the market.

24.
To strengthen the banking system’s ability to support growth, the mission conveyed
the key FSAP recommendations (Box 5):


18

Enhanced Stress tests and an Asset Quality Review (AQR) would be important steps towards putting
the banking system on a sounder footing. Stress tests, including on liquidity by currency, should
be performed on a consolidated basis. These need to be supplemented by a granular and
comprehensive review of banks’ asset portfolios to gauge capitalization needs, reduce
uncertainty on valuations, and bolster confidence following the long period of forbearance. In
particular, the AQR will be helpful to ascertain the identified capital shortfall in the baseline
scenario of 0.5-1 percent of GDP. If this is indeed confirmed, the authorities should devise the
necessary plans outlined in Box 5 to keep the banking system on a sound footing.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

RUSSIAN FEDERATION



The authorities should prepare an action plan to address deficiencies in supervision. In addition,
vigilant implementation and monitoring is needed for the many important changes that were
recently introduced to support CBR’s Risk Based Approach in supervision.7



Improvements in the bank resolution framework will be critical to minimize the use of public funds.
To improve the resolution effectiveness, and rely less on open bank resolution and the use of
public funds, CBR should take steps to strengthen and broaden resolution powers and
safeguards, in line with the Financial Stability Board (FSB) Key Attributes.



There is room to improve the liquidity framework. Steps are needed to reduce the fragmentation
of the money market and CBR’s collateral framework could play a key role by eliminating early
pre-payment and extendibility options to repo pledged instruments, setting additional controls
for non-marketable collaterals, and making the legal basis for realizing them more robust. CBR
should also formalize an appropriate safety net to meet the emergency liquidity needs of
individual institutions.

25.
Staff argued that deepening the financial sector is necessary to support strong and
sustainable economic growth. Comprehensive measures need to be taken to raise the efficiency of
the highly concentrated and mostly state-owned banking system to support the recovery. The
authorities should continue implementing their privatization plans, as economic conditions permit,
close weak banks, and refrain from using state-owned financial institutions to bail out struggling
commercial banks.
26.
VEB requires an improved business model and stronger oversight. The mission
recommended bringing VEB into a prudential supervisory framework to support, among other
things, VEB’s standards for risk, capital and liquidity management, and corporate governance.

Authorities’ Views
27.
The authorities were in broad agreement with the FSAP findings and have already
taken steps to address some key recommendations. The CBR has approved a work program to
improve supervision and asset valuation. A new department will be established to assess risk in all
banks, making use of new reports and IT platform, with loan-by-loan data for legal entities. The CBR
does not plan to conduct comprehensive AQRs, as recommended by the FSAP, but instead they plan
off-site asset quality analysis and stress tests by loan products, which are expected to provide
analytical support for macroprudential policies and a comprehensive view of banks’ capital needs by
end-2017. In addition, there have been several bills drafted in Parliament, addressing deficiencies
identified by the BCP Assessment. These include improved CBR interaction with external auditors,
requirements for CBR approval for major acquisition of financial companies, and increased powers
for CBR to assess collateral values. The authorities are committed to avoid further delays in extending

This includes new powers and regulations on the quality of risk management and governance within firms, and
introducing scrutiny of risk appetite in firms. In this context, systemic banks are to submit the results from their
Internal Capital Adequacy Assessment Process (ICAAP) in 2017, and all other banks in 2018.

the definition of related parties to cover economic relations (now planned for January 2017) while
legal amendments are under preparations to require lending to related parties on market terms.
Improvements to the bank resolution framework are under consideration and the authorities
announced their intention to introduce statutory bail-in of large corporate depositors in 2017. The
authorities argued that the current extraordinary economic circumstances, combined with the urgent
need to remove weak banks from the system, justified the extensive use of CBR funds in
resolution. Finally, the authorities agreed that VEB should have better underwriting and supervisory
standards and pointed to the recent change in management as a first step to improve the financial
standing of the bank.

D. Structural Policies: Leveraging the More Competitive Exchange Rate
28.
Structural impediments are slowing economic diversification and growth, and affecting
income convergence (Figure 9). Investment is constrained by weak protection of property rights,
burdensome administrative procedures and inspections, and a continued large footprint of the state
in the economy.8 As a result, productivity growth is lagging advanced countries. These structural
rigidities are weighing on the export response to the recent exchange rate depreciation and slowing
factor reallocation from the non-tradable to the tradable sector. Finally, Russia is facing adverse
demographics with declining population and lower labor force participation.
29.
Supporting the tradable sector is now the focus of the authorities’ policies and
structural agenda. The anti-crisis package of 2016 includes measures to support local production in
sectors with export potential, such as agriculture, machinery, and civilian aviation. It also aims to
foster economic diversification and efficiency by improving the investment climate, streamlining
SOEs’ costs and supporting SMEs. Counter-sanctions, consisting of bans and limits on imports of
agricultural and food products have supported import-substitution in agriculture and foodprocessing industries. Export diversification has decreased over time although among other EM
commodity exporters, Russia is the third most diversified fuel exporter after Bahrain and Colombia.9
30.
The authorities have been considering structural reform priorities for a long time. A
review of the authorities’ policy actions during the past 15 years suggests a recognition of the
structural impediments. However, progress has been slow due to lack of persistent implementation
and proper sequencing of actions. 10 Existing reforms in the pipeline include :
Institutional development. Efforts are underway to reduce the scope of state intervention in the
economy including through an acceleration of SOEs’ privatization. However, little progress has
been made since mid–2000 on basic institutional pillars, such as property rights protection,

governance and transparency, and judicial independence.11 Insufficient reporting of SOEs results
clouds the true footprint of the state in the economy and discourages competition. Recently
enacted amendments to broaden the categories of public officials forbidden to have foreign
bank accounts, as part of the anti-corruption law signals a commitment to improve institutions.


Goods market efficiency. Administrative requirements have been eased overtime for business
start-ups and red tape reduction efforts continue. In addition, legislative work is underway to
ease regulations for construction permits and a new corporate insolvency regime is being
prepared to incentivize restructuring rather than liquidation. However, remaining burdensome
regulations and a long list of strategic sectors prevent higher FDI flows by holding back entry in
some markets and thus competition.



Labor market policies. The authorities noted that the labor market would benefit from: (1)
improving professional education to make it more consistent with labor market demands; (2)
strengthening access to quality education for low-income groups; and (3) increasing labor
market mobility. The authorities have recently launched a website to showcase vacancies across
Russia in order to encourage labor mobility by lowering search costs.



Investing in infrastructure and innovation. A scientific fund was created to support innovation and
the adoption of new technologies. However, R&D spending remains low compared to peers and
tends to be inefficient, hampering its effectiveness. In addition, infrastructure spending has been
cut given lower oil prices and some projects financed from the NWF have been frozen.

31.
Staff stressed that structural reforms are indispensable to boost potential growth and
leverage the more competitive exchange rate. Cross-country research suggests that reaping the
benefits of structural reforms requires, as a pre-requisite, improvements in the institutional and
business environment.12 Specific priority areas are (see Box 6):


Institutional improvements. Accelerating reforms to reduce unwarranted administrative pressures
on businesses while improving the framework to settle disputes between the private and the
public sector would increase the efficiency of the goods market. To pave the way for government
divesture of stakes in SOEs, the recommendations of the 2014 fiscal transparency report should
be implemented, including by strengthening the financial oversight of SOEs. Strengthening
contract enforcement and the protection of property rights would increase productivity and
investment. Given the need for fiscal consolidation, tax policy changes should minimize the
negative impact on investment incentives. Finally, the list of strategic sectors that require prior
approval for foreign investment should be shortened to encourage FDI.



Labor market policies. Increasing mobility and reducing skills mismatches by improving education
quality and vocational training, increasing the coordination between employers and training
institutes, and strengthening active labor market policies should increase labor productivity.
Parametric pension reform, such as increasing the statutory retirement age, could help to offset
the negative demographic trend on labor markets.



Investing in innovation and infrastructure. Supporting innovation and protecting infrastructure
spending while directing it to bottlenecks in electricity and transport would support export
diversification and higher value added sectors.

Authorities’ Views
32.
The authorities acknowledged the need for reforms and broadly agreed with the
priorities. They emphasized that their reform strategy aims to complement the more competitive
exchange rate to diversify its economy. In that context, they are implementing various support
programs for SMEs to foster competition in the domestic market, improve the quality of production
and facilitate the increase of localization of manufacturing. They also highlighted ongoing efforts to
reduce the state’s footprint in the economy, including through the privatization program of SOEs.
However, they are also aware that trade integration initiatives will be needed to widen the scope of
market access to exporters. They noted their labor market policies pay particular attention to
increase labor productivity and the supply of labor by reducing skill mismatches through improving
education quality and vocational training, and increasing the coordination between employers and
training institutes. The authorities also agree that the pension reform should improve the incentives
for people to remain for longer in the labor market, thus temporarily helping maintain labor supply.

STAFF APPRAISAL
33.
The Russian economy continues to adjust to the dual shocks of lower oil prices and
sanctions. The economic contraction is nonetheless shallower than previous recessions as the
authorities’ economic package—a flexible exchange rate regime, banking sector capital and liquidity
injection, limited fiscal stimulus, and regulatory forbearance—cushioned the shocks, helped restore
confidence and stabilized the banking system.
34.
The recession is extending to a second year. Despite an effective and flexible policy
response, the economy will remain in recession in 2016 due to lower oil prices, sanctions, weak
household income growth and fiscal consolidation. With oil prices expected to stabilize and domestic
financial conditions to ease, the economy is projected to start growing again in 2017. However,
medium-term prospects remain subdued due to adverse population dynamics coupled with longstanding structural bottlenecks, and the impact of sanctions on productivity and investment.
35.
Initial steps to lower the deficit should lead the way to a credible medium-term fiscal
adjustment plan. Strong steps were taken in 2016 to limit the impact on the fiscal deficit of lower oil
prices. However, a smoother fiscal adjustment plan based on quality and permanent measures,
22

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

RUSSIAN FEDERATION

anchored within a credible multi-year framework would have been preferable. In this regard,
reintroducing in the 2017 budget the three-year budgeting framework is critical to help reduce
policy uncertainty by providing greater clarity over future fiscal measures, while a credible fiscal rule
would support medium-term sustainability. In addition, any fiscal adjustment should safeguard
growth-enhancing expenditures such as efficient public investment, education and health care
spending. Finally, a parametric pension reform has become urgent to help support the fiscal
adjustment in a timely manner. Such a reform should strive to develop and preserve much-needed
sources of long-term financing to the economy.
36.
Monetary policy normalization could resume at a cautious pace. Monetary policy has
been appropriately on hold since August 2015. However, monetary policy normalization could
resume cautiously as inflation is on a declining path and inflation expectations continue to fall. In
addition, the improvement in the external position is limiting potential depreciation pressures that
could fuel inflation. This said the pace of easing should be gradual given volatile oil prices,
uncertainty about future government’s income policies and the behavior of wages. In addition, policy
tightening in the U.S. or emerging market jitters could limit the central bank’s room to ease its policy
stance.
37.
Banking sector policies have been appropriate and early steps in implementing the
main recommendations of the FSAP are welcomed. The banking system remains weak but the
authorities’ willingness and ability to support it provides an important anchor to confidence. Staff
welcomes the authorities’ plans to perform a capital risk assessment of all banks. The asset quality
assessments could however be improved by adding: (1) a strong on-site component, with file reviews
and evaluation of collateral valuation and enforceability; (2) establishing a panel of external experts
to advise on setting scope and methodologies, drafting terms of reference, and overseeing conduct.
The authorities are encouraged to complement the bail-in plans with a plan to remove legal and
operational impediment in P&A transactions. This would allow shifting the focus from rescuing the
entire failed banks to rescuing the essential functions of the failed banks – protecting taxpayers’
money, while preserving financial stability. The diversification and deepening of the financial sector
are priorities to support strong and sustainable economic growth. In addition, policies should
emphasize pursuing the closure of weak banks, encouraging the involvement of the private sector in
bank resolution, and proceeding with privatization of state-owned banks as economic conditions
permit.
38.
A strong structural reform agenda should be put in place to leverage the more
competitive exchange rate. Russia has the opportunity to diversify its economy as a result of a
more competitive exchange rate. The authorities should act more decisively on the reform priorities
that they have identified to facilitate the reallocation of resources to the non-energy tradable sector.
Finally, to deliver on the needed increase in investment, specific structural reform priorities lie in the
following areas: (1) Accelerating reforms to reduce unwarranted administrative pressures on
businesses while strengthening contract enforcement and the protection of property rights; (2)
Increasing mobility and reducing skills mismatches by improving vocational training, increasing the
coordination between employers and training institutes, and increasing the statutory retirement age

to increase labor supply; and (3) Supporting innovation for higher value added sectors and
protecting infrastructure spending while directing it to bottlenecks in electricity and transport.
39.
It is proposed that the next Article IV consultation be held on the standard 12-month
cycle.

Box 6. Reform Priorities
Reform priorities are set by benchmarking to the EU. First, competitiveness gaps are identified
by benchmarking Russia to the average EU country, and on an income-adjusted basis, along a
wide set of indicators.1 Then, these gaps are ranked according to their importance for growth
using cross-country growth regressions. Finally, reform priorities are identified by interacting the
size of the reform gaps with the growth regression coefficients.
Russia is found to significantly lag the EU on most competitiveness indicators. The largest
gaps are in the areas of institutions (property rights and corruption indicators); goods market
efficiency (tax and tariff rates); financial market development (legal rights); business sophistication
(local supply quality and production process sophistication) and innovation (availability of
scientists and engineers).

Some gaps are large even compared to countries with a similar income level. Relative to
peers, Russia ranks high on innovation, infrastructure, health and education. However, gaps are
large in institutions and goods and market efficiency—the pre-requisites for innovation and
education to deliver substantial growth dividends.
Russia’s reform gaps are particularly large in areas found to be most critical for long-term
growth. The priority areas that need further improvements are institutions, infrastructure, goods
market efficiency, business sophistication and innovation.
The methodology is based on the Regional Economic Issues, Special Report, March 2015. Competitiveness is defined as the set
of institutions, policies, and factors that determine the level of productivity of a country. Data is sourced from the World
Economic Forum’s Global Competitiveness Report.

Overdue loans in rubles have increased primarily in the
construction and retail trade sectors…

… while overdue loans in FX have risen primarily in the
real estate and mining sectors.

Using sectoral loans in rubles show that nearly 25 percent
of the construction portfolio is overdue…

… while sectoral loans in FX uncover weak performance in
mining, agriculture, and machinery and equipment.

1/ Derived as [r - g - r(1+g) + ea(1+r)]/(1+g+r+gr) times previous period debt stock, with r = nominal effective interest rate on external debt; r = change in domestic GDP deflator in US dollar terms, g = real GDP growth rate,
e = nominal appreciation (increase in dollar value of domestic currency), and a = share of domestic-currency denominated debt in total external debt.
2/ The contribution from price and exchange rate changes is defined as [-r(1+g) + ea(1+r)]/(1+g+r+gr) times previous period debt stock. r increases with an appreciating domestic currency (e > 0) and rising inflation (based on GDP
deflator).
3/ For projection, line includes the impact of price and exchange rate changes.
4/ Defined as current account deficit, plus amortization on medium- and long-term debt, plus short-term debt at end of previous period.
5/ The key variables include real GDP growth; nominal interest rate; dollar deflator growth; and both non-interest current account and non-debt inflows in percent of GDP.
6/ Long-run, constant balance that stabilizes the debt ratio assuming that key variables (real GDP growth, nominal interest rate, dollar deflator growth, and non-debt inflows in percent of GDP) remain at their levels of the last
projection year.

Annex I. Implementation of Past IMF Recommendations
During the 2015 Article IV consultation, Directors commended the policy actions taken by the
authorities to stabilize the economy in light of the significant stress created by lower oil prices and
sanctions. Pre-existing structural weaknesses also contributed to this difficult situation. Directors
concurred that continued prudent policies and reforms would be necessary to ensure
macroeconomic stability and boost potential growth.

Foreign asset
and liability
position and
trajectory

Assessment. The projected current account surpluses suggest that Russia will continue to maintain a positive IIP,
which minimizes risks to external stability. Moreover, assets should increase further, as accumulation of fiscal savings in
the oil funds resumes in the medium-term. The external deleveraging since 2014 reduces risks further.
Current account

Background. From 2000 to 2013, the current account (CA) surplus fell from 18 to 2 percent of GDP, despite rising oil
prices, as consumption increased rapidly. A correction, however, is underway with the CA improving to 2.9 percent in
2014 and 5 percent in 2015. This improvement took place despite the negative terms of trade shock, as reduced oil
export revenues (approximately 7 percent of GDP) was offset by falling absorption (due to the real depreciation of the
ruble) and lower income payments. In the medium-term, the increase in oil prices will support gradual improvement in
the CA.

Background. The sustained oil price boom and related expansion of domestic demand led to a strong real effective
exchange rate (REER) appreciation between 2000 and 2013. The REER has since depreciated 18 percent between 2014
and 2015. This reflects the impact of lower terms of trade, sanctions, and the move to a floating exchange rate regime
in November 2014. The REER at end-January 2016 reached new lows as oil prices fell to their lowest level in a decade.
The REER has weakened 3 percent through April 2016 compared to its 2015 average.
Assessment. Based on the CA gap, staff assesses that the REER was not far from medium-term fundamentals in 2015
with a REER gap of about -7 to +7. 3/ The REER is now below the historical average and at the level it was before the
increases in oil prices. Nevertheless, in staff’s view, the REER equilibrium could be lower should the oil price shock
become permanent.
Background. Net private capital outflows continued in 2015 though the pace has significantly slowed relative to 2014,
as domestic confidence has resumed. External deleveraging has continued in the face of limited access to international
capital markets. Nonetheless, volatile and lower oil prices will continue to weigh on the outlook. Over the medium
term, structural outflows are expected to decline if Russia improves its investment climate.
Assessment. While Russia is exposed to risks of accelerated capital outflows because of the uncertain geopolitical
context, large international reserves provide substantial buffers and the new floating exchange rate regime will help
absorb these shocks.

Potential policy responses:
The nonoil fiscal deficit remains
significantly higher than its long-term
desirable level and needs to adjust to
facilitate a rebalancing from public to
private activity, and a re-allocation of
government expenditure from current to
capital spending. The consolidation should
be gradual to avoid undermining domestic
demand. This rebalancing—coupled with a
renewed emphasis on structural reforms to
invigorate the private sector—would help
increase public saving that would be
matched by both higher private and public
sector investment over the medium-term.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

Real exchange
rate

Relative to 2015, the REER has recently
depreciated further. This in part reflects
the adjustment to a new norm due to
substantially lower oil prices. The structural
implications of sanctions create
exceptional uncertainty when assessing
the external position. Nevertheless, staff’s
view is that the depreciation has kept the
REER not far from medium-term
fundamentals.

49

Assessment. There are particular uncertainties with the external assessment when oil plays such a dominant role in the
economy, and oil price movements have been very large, compounded now by the uncertain long-term impact of
sanctions on saving-investment decisions and therefore the normative external position. 2/ Staff assesses that the
2015 CA gap was between -2 to 2 percent of GDP. In the medium term, fiscal policy should be tightened to rebuild
buffers and save more of the oil wealth for future generations.

Overall Assessment:
The external position in 2015 was broadly
consistent with medium-term fundamentals
and desirable policy settings.

Annex II. External Sector Assessment

Background. The net international investment position (NIIP) at end-September 2015 was at about 23 percent GDP
(up from 6 percent in 2013), with gross assets of 89 percent of GDP and liabilities of 66 percent of GDP. Total external
debt is at 37.8 percent of GDP. There are no obvious maturity mismatches between the gross asset and liability
position. Historically, the NIIP position has not kept pace with the CA surpluses due to unfavorable valuation changes
and the treatment of “disguised” capital outflows.1/

Overall Assessment

Russia (continued)

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

Technical
Background
Notes

Background. Since adopting a free floating exchange rate regime, FX interventions have been limited. In May 2015,
the CBR started rebuilding reserves for few months as uncertainty remained elevated.
Assessment. International reserves stood at USD368 billion at end-2015, equivalent to 266 percent of the Fund’s
basic reserve adequacy metric, exceeding the adequacy minimum of 150 percent. Taking into account Russia’s
vulnerability to commodity shocks, the adjusted adequacy metric falls to 199 percent of the metric remaining above
the minimum adequacy threshold. A policy of small regular reserve purchases to replenish reserves could be
justified by the heightened level of uncertainty related to sanctions and as a buffer given Russia’s vulnerability to oil
shocks. Large FX interventions should be limited to episodes of market distress.
1/ Unfavorable valuation changes arise because the Russian stock market has performed very well in the last 15
years as the oil price soared, boosting the valuation of foreign-owned assets. “Disguised” capital outflows include
transactions such as pre-payments on import contracts where the goods are not delivered, repeated large transfers
abroad that deviate from standard remittances behavior, or securities transactions at inflated prices. The CBR
includes estimates of “disguised” capital outflows in the financial account but not in the foreign asset position of
the reported NIIP. Hence, the actual NIIP position could be higher than the reported level and this treatment of
“disguised” outflows may explain part of the discrepancy between accumulated CA surpluses and the reported NIIP
position.
2/ The EBA-estimated 2015 CA norm was 6.2 percent of GDP and the cyclically adjusted CA was 7.3 percent of GDP.
The difference in the model-based gap relative to 2014 reflects both an improvement in the 2015 CA (from 2.9
percent in 2014) and an increase in the estimated current account norm (from 5 percent in 2014). The EBA
estimated CA norm of 6.2 percent of GDP rests mostly on the need to save out of income from non-renewable oil
exports. Staff’s assessment shares this basic logic in also calling for a CA surplus for Russia but acknowledges that
such saving (i.e., refraining from consumption) would not necessarily have to take a financial form and could in part
take the form of productive investment spending, which could justify a somewhat lower CA surplus than the EBAestimated norm. Sanctions and geopolitical tensions have introduced an additional level of complexity in the
external assessment as they introduce exceptional uncertainty that model based estimates do not adequately
account for.
3/ The EBA Level REER model suggests an undervaluation of 21 percent, and the EBA Index REER regression model
an undervaluation of 22 percent. The estimated impact of commodity terms of trade may, however, be less reliable
in these models as they are derived from the historical relationships, which quite significantly understate the impact
of the recent large oil price shock on the REER gap.

Exchange Arrangements: Effective November 10, 2014, the CBR eliminated its exchange rate
corridor and canceled regular FX interventions, adopting a de jure and de facto floating exchange
rate regime, with FX interventions conducted only to safeguard financial stability. The Russian
Federation accepted the obligations of Article VIII, Sections 2, 3, and 4 of the IMF Articles of
Agreement with effect from June 1, 1996, and maintains an exchange system free of restrictions on
the making of payments and transfers for current international transactions.
Article IV Consultation: Russia is on the standard 12-month consultation cycle. The last
consultation was concluded on June 29, 2015.
FSAP Participation, FTE and ROSCs: Russia participated in the Financial Sector Assessment
Program during 2016, and the FSSA report will be discussed by the Board at the time as
the 2016 Article IV discussion. An FSAP update took place in the fall of 2007, and the FSSA report
was discussed by the Board in August 2008, at the time of the 2008 Article IV discussion. An FSAP
financial stability assessment took place during April 2011, and the FSSA report was discussed by the
Board in September 2011, at the time of 2011 Article IV Consultation.
A recent pilot of the IMF’s new Fiscal Transparency Evaluation (FTE) was undertaken in October
2013 and published in May 2014. It assessed the Russian government’s fiscal reporting, forecasting,
and risk management practices against the IMF’s revised Fiscal Transparency Code

WORLD BANK GROUP RELATIONS1
The World Bank Group’s engagement with the Russian Federation has been three-dimensional:
global, regional, and national. At the global level, Russia has increased its contributions to IDA
and supports the provision of global public goods through contributions to global funds. In addition,
the Bank offers its expertise to help prepare Russia’s engagement in international fora such as APEC,
G20, and BRICS. At the regional level, the World Bank Group supports Russia as an emerging donor
for less-developed countries in ECA. Russia is already a significant provider of development
assistance through a growing portfolio of IDA/IBRD-administered trust funds. At the national level,
the World Bank Group has aimed to maximize its development impact by reaching out to the regions
in Russia with the most development needs.

RUSSIAN FEDERATION

A. International Bank for Reconstruction and Development
The Russian Federation joined the World Bank (IBRD and IDA) in 1992. The Bank has provided

financing for 70 projects in different sectors totaling slightly over US$10.5 billion in IBRD loans.
About 95 percent of the total portfolio has already been disbursed. IBRD’s current portfolio of
projects amounts to US$636 million in the areas of public sector management, municipal
infrastructure, cultural heritage preservation, financial literacy, hydro-meteorology, and forestry. The
undisbursed balance is US$267 million as of May 2016. All of the Bank’s financing in the portfolio is
in the form of investment project financing.
Advisory Services and Analytics (ASA) are an important part of IBRD’s engagement in Russia.
ASA products are helping to modernize public finance and administration and improve social service
delivery and the investment climate. The Bank also provides technical assistance in areas such as
early childhood development, indigenous people, social development, and social accountability. In
FY16, along with two traditional flagship Russia Economic Reports, the World Bank is planning to
release a study on Connectivity and Inclusive Growth in Russia.
Demand for Reimbursable Advisory Services (RAS) in Russia is steady, with continued interest
from the regions and growing demand from the federal government. Since 2007, the World
Bank has entered into more than 80 RAS agreements, which cover a wide range of activities that are
well aligned with Russia’s development challenges. RAS are also of increasing importance for Russia’s
regions, as more than 30 of Russia’s subnational governments have signed at least one RAS with the
World Bank.

B. International Finance Corporation
Russia became an IFC member in 1993. Since then, IFC’s long-term investments in Russia totaled
US$10 billion, of which US$3.5 billion were mobilized from partners, across 263 projects.2 As of May
2016, IFC’s committed investment portfolio in Russia stood at US$1.0 billion in 65 projects with about
50 clients. Since the beginning of the current CPS period, IFC provided about US$2.0 billion of longterm financing to the clients in Russia, of which about US$800 million was mobilized from partners.
In addition to the investment services, since early years of its operations in Russia, IFC has provided
a wide range of advisory services to the Russian companies, financial institutions, and municipalities.

C. Multilateral Guarantee Agency
MIGA’s gross exposure in Russia was US$437 million as of April 2016. MIGA is involved in five
projects in the finance, infrastructure, and manufacturing sectors. In dollar terms, MIGA’s exposure is
concentrated in Russia’s financial sector (some 75 percent of MIGA’s gross exposure), supporting the
investment of a French financial institution in its Russian subsidiary. In terms of the number of

projects, MIGA’s exposure is concentrated in the manufacturing sector, geographically located in the
greater Moscow area as well as Rostov Oblast.

STATISTICAL ISSUES
(As of June 2, 2015)
I. Assessment of Data Adequacy for Surveillance
General: Data provision is broadly adequate for surveillance. However, in the context of emerging
data demands for assessing external vulnerabilities, the scope for further data improvements exists.
National Accounts: Data are broadly adequate for surveillance, but there have been concerns about
the reliability and consistency of quarterly GDP estimates among a wide range of users,
including Fund staff. The Federal State Statistics Service (Rosstat) started a national account
development plan for 2011–17, which will expedite compilation of quarterly GDP estimates
consistent with the annual GDP estimates. In April 2016, Rosstat released GDP estimates compiled
according to the 2008 SNA; however, the data are only available from 2014. In addition, the data for 2011
to 2013 have been revised, but are compiled according to the 1993 SNA. The main changes introduced in
the latter revised series include improvements in the estimation of the imputed rental services of owneroccupied dwellings and the use of the market value of assets to estimate consumption of fixed capital.
The unavailability of balance sheet data continues to be an obstacle to analyzing balance sheet
vulnerabilities; however, work is underway to disseminate the first quarterly sectoral accounts and
balance sheets for 2012–14 by 2016.
Price Statistics: Monthly CPI and PPI, both compiled using the Two-Stage (Modified) Laspeyres
(2000=100), cover all regions of the Russian Federation. The weights reflect expenditures in the
12 months ended the previous September. Aggregate price indices are compiled for each good
and service item for the 89 regions, seven federal regions, and the Russian Federation as a whole.
However, population weights, as opposed to expenditure shares are applied to the individual
regional indices possibly biasing the CPI downwards if price increases are higher in regions with
higher per capita expenditures. Detailed data on total annual sales, which are used to develop
weights for the PPI, are published by economic activity on the Rosstat website. The detailed
weights are available only on the Russian version of the website, making it less accessible to some
users. Further efforts to improve the treatment of seasonal items in the core inflation index and a
new household budget survey—which has been under consideration for some time—could
significantly strengthen data quality.
Government Finance Statistics: The authorities compile comprehensive set of the general
government accounts based on the Government Finance Statistics Manual 2001 (GFSM 2001) on
annual basis. These data comprise the statement of sources and uses of cash as well as the accrual
based government operations (revenue, expenditure and transactions in assets and liabilities),
complete balance sheet (including non-financial assets), holding gains and losses and other changes
in volume of assets and liabilities, and outlays by functions of government (COFOG). Monthly GFSM
2001 based statement of sources of uses of cash is also compiled for the whole general government
sector. In addition, the authorities have recently started reporting quarterly accrual based general
government operation statement as well as financial balance sheet. Some gaps remain, for example
the lack of historical quarterly data, unexplained data breaks (for instance the reclassification of some

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

RUSSIAN FEDERATION

wage expenses from the budgetary central government accounts to the regional government
accounts (following 2011 reforms ), unavailability of monthly data on ruble guarantees prior to 2011,
no integrated debt monitoring and reporting system, and the lack of reconciliation between different
datasets of fiscal reporting (budget execution, cash flow statement, economic versus functional
classification, fiscal statistics data).
Monetary and Financial Statistics: In the context of the recent global turmoil, analysis of
balance sheet effects has been hindered by a lack of comparable data on the currency and
maturity breakdown of banking-sector assets and liabilities. Adoption of data reporting in the full
detail of the framework for Standardized Report Forms (SRFs), as recommended by an STA
mission in 2007 (and re-affirmed by the ROSC mission in 2010), would provide comprehensive
information on the currency and instrument breakdowns of the assets and liabilities of the central
bank, credit institutions, and other financial corporations. Since March 2011, the Banking System
Survey (which is equivalent to the Depository Corporations/Broad Money Survey) published by
the Central Bank of Russia (CBR) has included a breakdown of positions by national and foreign
currency. Publication of a similar breakdown of positions by national and foreign currency in the
central bank and the credit institutions surveys would be useful for analysis.
External sector statistics: Balance of payments data are broadly adequate for surveillance, and
significant improvements have been made to enhance data quality. The CBR has recently published
the gross capital flow data for the private sector, which would facilitate the analysis of relatively
complex flows. Starting from 2012, the balance of payments is compiled according to the framework
of the Fund’s Balance of Payments and International Investment Position Manual, sixth edition
(BPM6) and the CBR has revised historical data (going back to 2000Q1 for BOP, and to 2004Q1 for
IIP), consistent with BPM6. Partial data from a variety of sources are supplemented by the use of
estimates and adjustments to improve data coverage. In particular, the CBR makes adjustments to
merchandise import data published by the Federal Customs Service to account for “shuttle trade,”
smuggling, and undervaluation. Statistical techniques are also used to estimate transactions and
positions of foreign-owned enterprises with production sharing agreements, and these techniques
are continuously being improved. At the same time, Russian compilers are seeking to reconcile
their data with those of partner countries. Improvements have been made in the coverage and
quality of surveys on direct investment, and the CBR is participating in the Fund’s Coordinated
Direct Investment Survey (CDIS) and Coordinated Portfolio Investment Survey (CPIS).
Financial sector surveillance: Russian reports all 12 core financial soundness indicators (FSIs) and
9 of the 13 encouraged FSIs for deposit takers on a quarterly basis with the exception of FSIs for
earnings and profitability that are reported on an annual basis. In addition, 2 FSIs for households
and 3 FSIs for real estate markets are reported on a quarterly basis. Data are reported for posting
