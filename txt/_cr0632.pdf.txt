Staff Report for the 2005 Article IV Consultation
Prepared by the Staff Representatives for the 2005 Consultation with
Trinidad and Tobago
Approved by Caroline Atkinson and G. Russell Kincaid
October 27, 2005
In a regional context, Trinidad and Tobago is an energy-rich economy with one of the
higher income levels in the Caribbean but only average social indicators. It has a complex
financial system, with well-developed banking, insurance and investment firms, enabling it to
serve as a regional financial center and source of capital for Caribbean entities, including
sovereigns.
Recent developments: Macroeconomic developments are being driven by a highly favorable
external environment. Surging oil prices have strengthened the external current account
balance, fueled the expansion of domestic absorption and contributed to high levels of
liquidity in the financial system. The government’s nonenergy deficit has expanded and there
has been a recent up tick in inflation.
Fund relations: Trinidad and Tobago has accepted the obligations of Article VIII,
Sections 2, 3, and 4. It maintains an exchange system free of restrictions on the making of
payments and transfers for current international transactions. The Executive Board meeting
concluding the 2004 Article IV consultations was held on October 22, 2004. A Financial
Stability Assessment was carried out in 2005 and its findings are scheduled to be discussed
by the Board together with this Staff Report.
Discussions: A staff team comprising Sanjaya Panth (head), Goohoon Kwon, Irineu de
Carvalho, Rafael Romeu, and Wendell Samuel (all WHD) held discussions for the 2005
Article IV consultations in Port-of-Spain during July 14–26, 2005. The mission met with
Hon. Conrad Enill, Minister in the Ministry of Finance; Governor Ewart Williams of the
Central Bank of Trinidad and Tobago; other senior government officials; representatives of
the private sector and labor unions; and the opposition party. Mr. Charles de Silva (OED) and
Mr. Das (MFD), who led the 2005 FSAP missions to Trinidad and Tobago, joined the team
for the final discussions.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
Trinidad and Tobago is a small energy-rich Caribbean economy. The oil and gas sector,
including downstream activities, currently accounts for about 40 percent of GDP, over
80 percent of exports, and approximately half of government revenues. However, its
contribution to employment is less than 5 percent. Within the Caribbean, Trinidad and
Tobago has become a major financial center and a source of capital for regional entities,
including sovereigns.
The political balance is delicate. In recent years, political affiliation has largely split along
ethnic lines. The current government, formed by the People’s National Movement party, took
office in early 2003 after three successive elections in as many years. The next elections are
not due until 2007 but may be called earlier—the political environment is already charged in
anticipation.
Macroeconomic performance and financial developments are being driven by a highly
favorable external environment. Surging oil prices have strengthened the external current
account balance, financed an expansion of aggregate demand, and contributed to high levels
of liquidity in the financial system. The labor market has tightened significantly, and there
are tentative signs that the economy is producing at, or near, capacity. Inflationary pressures
have emerged—annual headline inflation stood at 7 percent in September, up from
2¾ percent a year and a half ago.
The nonenergy fiscal deficit has widened substantially, adding to demand pressures in
the short-run and heightening exposure to long term vulnerabilities. Following an
already expansionary stance in FY 2004/05, the budget for FY 2005/06 envisages a
significant further widening of the nonenergy deficit (the overall deficit less energy
revenues). This is due to a combination of lower nonenergy revenues (from reduced tax rates
and increased allowances) as well as increases in non-interest expenditures. However, large
overall surpluses are expected to continue on account of high energy prices. Staff advice
focused on the benefits of saving a larger portion of the current high energy revenues and
strengthening expenditure administration.
The strong external inflows and widening nonenergy fiscal deficits pose several
challenges for monetary and exchange rate policy. In the short run, the priority remains to
address the liquidity in the system stemming from the rising nonenergy deficit. In the long
run, if oil prices remain at high levels, a real appreciation appears inevitable in the absence of
sufficient fiscal tightening. In this context, the mission recommended moving toward greater
nominal exchange rate flexibility.
The authorities’ structural reform agenda is currently focused on tax and financial
sector reform. The reform of nonenergy taxes aims to increase efficiency and predictability.
Financial sector reforms, consistent with the FSAP recommendations, seek to strengthen
supervision and consolidate Trinidad and Tobago’s role as a regional financial center.

I. INTRODUCTION
1.
Trinidad and Tobago is a small energy-rich Caribbean economy. The oil and
gas sector, including downstream activities, currently accounts for about 40 percent of GDP,
over 80 percent of exports, and approximately half of government revenues. However, its
contribution to employment is less than 5 percent. Within the Caribbean, Trinidad and
Tobago has become a major financial center and a source of capital for regional entities,
including sovereigns. Trinidad and Tobago is one of the larger Caribbean nations in terms of
GDP and population. Its energy wealth has enabled it to achieve one of the higher standards
of living in the region. Nevertheless, income inequality and poverty rates are only at about
regional averages, and social and ethnic tensions remain high.

2.
The political balance is delicate. In recent years, political affiliation has largely split
along ethnic lines. The current government, formed by the People’s National Movement
party, took office in early 2003 after three successive elections in as many years. The
government does not have the qualified parliamentary majority required for many important
decisions, significantly complicating the task of policy-making. The next elections are not
due until 2007 but may be called earlier—the political environment is already charged in
anticipation.

-53.
Earlier Article IV consultations have emphasized fiscal and financial sector
issues, which the authorities are addressing in large part. In fiscal areas, the authorities
are proceeding with tax reform and establishing a permanent oil fund. There has, however,
been little progress in reforming fiscal management policies and practices. As regards the
financial sector, the authorities are implementing their ongoing reform program embodied in
the 2004 White Paper. With Fund and Bank assistance, and in conjunction with the current
annual consultations, an assessment of the financial sector was also carried out during 2005.
II. RECENT ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS
4.
Macroeconomic performance and financial developments are being driven by a
highly favorable external environment. Surging oil prices have strengthened the external
current account balance, fueled the expansion of domestic absorption, and contributed to high
levels of liquidity in the financial system. There are tentative signs that the economy is
producing at, or near, capacity and inflationary pressures are emerging.
5.
The balance of payments is in large
surplus. Exports rose by US$1.2 billion
(10 percent of GDP) in 2004, significantly
outpacing import growth and lifting the
current account surplus to 14½ percent of
GDP from 9 percent of GDP in 2003. While
some of the higher current account receipts
were offset by private capital outflows, the
overall balance of payments surplus still
doubled to US$0.7 billion (6 percent of GDP).
With oil prices rising further, these trends are
accelerating in 2005—the foreign assets of
both the commercial banks and the central
bank have continued to rise rapidly this year.
6.
In recent years, the nonenergy fiscal
deficit has widened substantially due to
higher expenditures, although the overall
balance remains in surplus. An already
expansionary budget for FY 2004/05 was
supplemented by a mid-year amendment that
implied a deterioration of the central
government’s nonenergy deficit (the overall
deficit, excluding energy revenues) by
4½ percent of GDP in a single year.1 While
budgetary execution was initially running
behind schedule, the authorities’ preliminary
estimates indicate a sharp pick-up in spending

The definition used by staff of energy revenues includes, in addition to direct revenues from
extraction, also receipts from downstream energy enterprises.

the increase in energy revenues outpaced the expansion of the nonenergy deficit, the overall
surplus is estimated to have increased in FY 2004/05, to about 3¼ percent of GDP from
2 percent the previous year.

Monetary conditions have largely been accommodative, although signs of
accelerating inflation have led to a recent shift toward tightening. The monetization of
energy receipts by the government to finance the nonenergy deficit is the major source of
liquidity injection into the financial system. The monetary impact of these injections was
amplified in 2004 by changes in commercial

successive rounds of tightening in the United States, the differential vis-à-vis U.S. interest
rates remains narrower than at the start of the year and the real interest rate is negative.
9.
Consumers are being shielded from rising international oil prices. Electricity,
water and petroleum products, whose prices are administratively fixed, account for nearly
10 percent of the retail price index basket. There have been no substantive increases in
administrative prices for petroleum products since 2003, leaving local gasoline prices
currently at about two-thirds of the level in neighboring Caribbean countries. Electricity
prices have also been unchanged for several years. Direct budgetary subsidies for petroleum
products and electricity amounted to nearly 2 percent of GDP during FY 2004/05.
10.
Financial markets have generally been buoyant in reflection of the ample
liquidity, and credit ratings are up. Insurance, pension funds, finance companies, and
mutual funds—belonging to a few regionally active conglomerates—have all experienced
rapid asset accumulation, with mutual fund investments reaching roughly two-thirds of bank
assets and stock market capitalization approaching 140 percent of GDP in 2004. The
financial system as a whole increased credit to the private sector by 18 percent in 2004, a
leap compared with single-digit annual growth since 2001. The banking soundness indicators
generally improved in 2004, as the capital adequacy ratio increased to 22.7 percent and return
on assets reached 3.7 percent. The overall stock market index climbed by 55 percent during
2004 and by a further 15 percent through May 2005 before falling back to the end-2004
level. In August 2005, Standard and Poor’s raised the sovereign foreign currency debt rating
to A-, providing a boost also to the credit worthiness of local companies.
11.
The budget for FY 2005/06 submitted to parliament on September 28, 2005
envisages a significant further expansion of the nonenergy deficit, to be financed by
higher energy revenues. The authorities reoriented the tax system to generate greater
collections from the energy sector while sharply reducing income tax rates and expanding
allowances for the nonenergy sector. As a result, several hundred thousand taxpayers have
been removed from the tax net. The authorities also introduced numerous other changes to
both direct and indirect taxes. Altogether, nonenergy revenue receipts are expected to decline
by some 3¾ percent of GDP during FY 2005/06. At the same time, expenditures are
budgeted to increase by a further 2 percentage points of GDP, relative to the estimated
outturn for FY 2004/05, including on account of a number of one-off items. Cumulatively,
this implies a doubling of the central government’s nonenergy deficit over two years—from
9¼ percent of GDP in FY2003/04 to 18¼ percent of GDP now projected for FY 2005/06.
Just over half of this deterioration, or 5¼ percentage points of GDP, is on account of higher
non-interest expenditures, mostly under the “current” heading (Tables 1 and 2). A large
overall surplus is nevertheless still projected for FY 2005/06 on account of increased energy
revenues.
III. OUTLOOK FOR 2005–06 AND THE MEDIUM TERM
12.
In the short run, Trinidad and Tobago’s outlook remains favorable, owing to
high oil prices and expanding energy production. In the baseline scenario, overall real
GDP growth is expected to pick up modestly, to 6¾ percent in 2005, and accelerate to over
10 percent in 2006 before stabilizing at around 3 percent over the medium term. The spike is

-8mostly due to the expected coming-on-stream in late 2005 of a new liquefied natural gas
(LNG) facility. As regards the nonenergy sector, despite some moderation, growth is
projected to be higher during 2005–06 than the recent average. Buoyant demand from the
expanding government sector should, in particular, provide a further boost to overall activity,
offsetting some weakening of agriculture. Emerging capacity constraints imply, nevertheless,
that some of this demand will inevitably manifest itself in higher prices. Core inflation is,
therefore, projected to pick up further in 2005–06. The impact on headline inflation of the
expansionary fiscal stance should, however, be less pronounced, if food prices, responsible
for most of the recent increase in overall inflation, stabilize as expected. All in all, consumer
price inflation for 2006 is projected at 8 percent, up sharply from the range of 3–4 percent
during 2001–03, prior to the oil-price induced boom.
13.
Current staff baseline projections envisage high energy receipts and robust
growth also into the medium term. Under currently projected extraction rates for natural
resources and expected WEO oil prices, the current account surplus will remain very large,
albeit on a declining trend over the medium term. Annual growth of the nonenergy sector is
projected to stabilize at about 4–4½ percent over the medium term, broadly in line with the
average outturn during 2001–04. Overall GDP growth would be slightly lower as growth in
the energy sector decelerates after the completion of the LNG plant. The nonenergy deficit
should gradually improve beyond FY 2005/06 if, as the authorities currently envisage, oneoff items from this year’s budget are not replaced and the nonenergy tax base is expanded
and compliance improved (see paragraph 31). This would then enable inflation to gradually
trend downwards, albeit remaining above that of recent years throughout the medium term.
14.
The macroeconomic environment is likely to be less benign if large nonenergy
deficits persist. An illustrative scenario considers the impact of overall expenditures
remaining broadly at budgeted FY 2005/06 levels in relation to GDP (implying an increase in
non-interest expenditures as interest costs are forecast to decline with continuing overall
fiscal surpluses) (Table 7 and Figure 1). In this scenario, the fiscal stance would aggravate
pressures for a real exchange rate appreciation (Box 1). While in the short run, output could
be somewhat higher than under the baseline, the demand pressures could lead to entrenched
high inflation, crowd out the private sector, and ultimately have a detrimental impact on
growth prospects over the longer term. The build-up of windfall savings would be less than
in the baseline, also implying, with unchanged energy reserves between the two scenarios,
that there would be less wealth from energy resources available for the future.
IV. REPORT ON THE DISCUSSIONS
15.
The discussions focused on the policy implications of sustained high oil prices. In
the current environment, the specific challenges relate to: (i) striking an appropriate balance
on the use of energy resources between the short-run and the longer term; (ii) managing
aggregate demand to avoid overheating the economy in the short run; and (iii) pursuing
policies to avoid Dutch disease and create an environment for sustainable private sector-led
growth over the long term.

Box 1. Oil Prices and the Real Exchange Rate
A permanent increase in oil prices could exert significant upward pressures on the longterm real exchange rate of the Trinidad and Tobago dollar. The precise magnitudes
remain very uncertain; depending, inter alia, on the response of private capital flows and
other Trinidad and Tobago-specific parameters, including relative preferences between
imports and domestically produced goods. However, two simple conceptual frameworks,
using parameters obtained from cross-country studies, are suggestive of sizeable pressures
emerging.
The first approach draws on the outcome of an extensive study undertaken by the
Fund’s Research Department.1 The cross-country study has identified four variables (net
foreign assets, relative per capita income, relative manufacturing output, and commodity
prices) as core factors behind the movements of the real exchange rates of 39 countries
between 1980 and 2003. According to the long-term relationship identified by the study, an
improvement in the terms of trade by 10 percent raises the equilibrium real exchange rate by
about 5 percent, after controlling for the effects of other variables. Relative to mid-2004,
current WEO projections imply an improvement in Trinidad and Tobago’s terms of trade by
nearly 30 percent over the medium term.
The second approach considers the extent of real exchange rate realignment required
to offset current account imbalances caused by a large swing in the terms of trade.2
Standard assumptions about capacity constraints, labor mobility and income elasticity of
consumption imply that for every 1 percent increase in permanent income, consumption of
traded goods would need to rise by about 2 percent in Trinidad and Tobago in order to
balance supply and demand in goods and labor markets. Depending on the elasticity of
substitution between traded and nontraded goods, the adjustment in relative prices necessary
to bring about such an adjustment may be of a broadly similar magnitude. A simple
calibration suggests that the long-term purchasing power of the population of Trinidad and
Tobago may have risen by some 10 percent due to the recent rise in trend oil prices, implying
that if high oil prices persist, the real exchange rate may need to move by as much as
20 percent over the medium term.

- 11 A. Fiscal Policy and the Management of Energy Wealth
16.
The government has a long-term development program to use energy resources
to bring the country to “developed-economy status” by 2020. This requires investments in
human and physical capital to create room for the nonenergy economy to grow, which in turn
should eventually reduce the budget’s dependence on the energy sector. The authorities see
the 2005/06 budget as part of this long-term strategy—it gives priority to the issues of
security and safety, education, health care, and housing and poverty reduction. Accordingly,
the expenditures growing most are transfers and subsidies to households, which include the
costs of the free tertiary education that is now being made available to all. Until the recent oil
boom, central government primary expenditures in Trinidad and Tobago have remained
below that of the rest of the Caribbean in relation to GDP but the FY 2005/06 budget would
bring them up to about the regional average. Notably, however, Trinidad and Tobago also
undertakes a significant amount of expenditures, in particular capital expenditures, through
off-budget entities.
17.
While recognizing the need to invest in the economy, the mission cautioned the
authorities about the risks posed by the scale and scope of the fiscal expansion. A
nonenergy deficit of the size projected in the FY 2005/06 budget raised questions about longterm sustainability (Box 2). More immediately, it risked further exacerbating inflationary
pressures, added to concerns about the impact on the real economy of a real exchange rate
appreciation, and complicated the task of monetary management. Furthermore, weak
institutions could limit the potential to undertake expenditures effectively—for example,
Trinidad and Tobago’s score in Transparency International’s Corruption Perception Index
has recently deteriorated. As regards the tax cuts, while they helped distribute the energy
wealth to the population, Fund technical assistance missions had strongly emphasized the
need to phase in rate reductions only very gradually, especially given that data unavailability
had precluded assessments of their likely revenue impacts.
18.
The mission suggested that Trinidad and Tobago could benefit in several ways
from saving a larger portion of the current high energy receipts. The finite nature of
energy resources suggested that a smaller and steady improvement of the nonenergy balance
now was preferable to any sudden and very large adjustment down the line, as distant as that
prospect may currently appear to be. Saving more of the energy wealth could also be
beneficial from a growth perspective—the increased demand for nontradables coming from
the fiscal expansion would, in the context of capacity constraints, adversely impact
competitiveness. Furthermore, cross-country studies, including those focusing on the
Caribbean, consistently suggested that decreasing the “government burden” on the economy
(typically measured by government consumption in relation to GDP) could boost economic
growth.3

- 12 Box 2. Long-Term Sustainability
For countries using exhaustible resources to finance expenditures, a natural question that arises is “how long is
the existing fiscal position tenable?” The answer depends crucially on the size of natural resources in the
ground, prices that these resources can be expected to command over the long term, and the extent to which
expenditures contribute to expanding the nonenergy economy, and thereby, the nonenergy revenue base, over
the long term. The first two factors are subject to frequent and sizeable revisions in both directions and the latter
is not always clearly measurable.
Nevertheless, a simple saving-dissaving model can provide useful insights into the question. The model
considers when accumulated savings from fiscal surpluses would run out for a given nonenergy deficit in
relation to nonenergy GDP (which is assumed to grow at a fixed rate). Such an analysis for Trinidad and
Tobago suggests that the current fiscal stance is not consistent with long-term sustainability as defined in this
model. Specifically, if the nonenergy deficit remained as in the staff’s baseline medium-term scenario,
accumulated savings would run out by 2030 (see chart below). This is under assumptions of oil prices as in the
WEO through 2009 and constant at US$58 per barrel in real terms thereafter and taking into account the recent
changes to the energy tax regime, which has significantly increased the government’s share of energy wealth. A
US$10 increase in oil prices over and above the baseline would extend the year of depletion to about 2035.
Conversely, a US$10 decrease, relative to the baseline, would bring the date considerably forward. All three
scenarios are based on optimistic assumptions that all currently estimated reserves (proven, possible and
probable) are fully extracted, that the average real rate of return on savings is 3½ percent, and that the expected
yield from energy revenue assumed in the FY 2005/06 budget is sustained. Looked at in a slightly different
way, under these same optimistic assumptions, a nonenergy deficit of no more than about 13½ percent of
current GDP can be financed indefinitely from the energy wealth compared to the currently projected
nonenergy deficit of 18¼ percent of GDP for FY 2005/06.

How does the sustainability of the fiscal position of Trinidad and Tobago compare to other energy-rich
economies? In 2004, Trinidad and Tobago’s use of energy resources to finance the deficit was not far out of line
with other similarly resource-rich countries (see chart below). In the absence of any changes in the other
countries, the recent increase in Trinidad and Tobago’s nonenergy deficit would, however, place it among the
more intensive users of its natural resources.

19.
Reducing vulnerabilities also argued for larger fiscal savings. There remained, in
particular, a risk that energy export earnings may decrease substantially—oil price volatility
has been very high in the past. Expenditures, on the other hand, were very difficult to rein in
once increased. In this regard, the large spending programs and the dramatic widening of the
nonenergy deficit exposed Trinidad and Tobago very much to the risks of sudden falls in
energy prices. In this connection, the mission wondered, for example, about the continued
rationale for large and expanding public employment programs in the midst of a tight labor
market.
20.
The authorities noted the need to use the energy revenues more expeditiously to
put in place the necessary infrastructure for growth. They indicated that public
investments, including in the areas of health and education, were vital to increasing
productivity in the nonenergy sector. The budget execution system was, however, antiquated,
having inherited a variety of institutional drawbacks, including impediments to attracting and
retaining qualified staff, and overly rigid rules for evaluation, tender, and procurement. They
noted that in an effort to ease these severe bottlenecks in expenditure administration,
agencies outside the central government apparatus were being set up to manage government
infrastructure initiatives. These agencies, 15 of which were identified in the budget statement
for FY 2005/06, would take on some of the design, procurement and management functions
that had hitherto been carried out by government ministries but would outsource the actual
execution and operation of specific projects.
21.
The mission suggested that it may be more useful to reform and restructure the
existing government apparatus than to set up new entities. It would also be important to
ensure that the entities that are set up conduct their operations with full transparency and
accountability. In this regard, a fiscal Report on Observance of Standards and Codes (ROSC)
could, in addition to documenting the strengths and weaknesses of expenditure
administration, also suggest useful ways to strengthen budgetary management processes and
ensure adequate accountability. The authorities confirmed their interest, in principle, in
preparing a ROSC in due course.
22.
Some increase in expenditures notwithstanding, the authorities also reiterated
their intent to maintain fiscal prudence by continuing to save a large portion of the
energy windfall. They pointed to larger amounts having been put aside in the interim
revenue stabilization fund than had been budgeted for in FY 2004/05. They also emphasized
the lessons from the late 1970s when a financial crisis had followed an oil bonanza. In this
regard, they stressed the progress that was being made this time around toward establishing a
permanent fund to manage long-term savings from energy revenues. They saw this fund, the
Heritage and Stabilization Fund (HSF), serving three main purposes: (i) helping sustain
public expenditure during cyclical downturns in oil prices; (ii) providing for savings to draw
on following the eventual depletion of energy reserves; and, (iii) undertaking strategic and
tactical investments for the diversification and transformation of the economy. Sixty percent
of energy revenues arising from above a reference oil price would be deposited into the
HSF’s Financial Investment Portfolio (FIP) and the remainder into its Strategic Investment
Portfolio (SIP). The FIP would be tapped when oil prices fell below a threshold whereas
expenditures from the SIP would operate independently of the oil price.

- 14 23.
The mission welcomed the steps being taken toward establishing the HSF and
suggested its strengthening in a number of respects. Ideally, the fund should receive all
energy revenues and finance the nonenergy deficit. The calculation of the medium-term
reference oil price that would trigger deposits into the fund also warranted clarification.
Finally, expenditures should not be undertaken directly from the fund—such investments are
best handled through the budget’s public sector investment program rather than through a
separate mechanism that shields some expenditures from the normal competitive
parliamentary budgetary process. Also, as the returns on domestic investments are likely to
be highly correlated with domestic economic growth, and hence revenues, such investments
would risk exposing both the budget and the accumulated savings to the same vulnerabilities.
24.
The authorities explained that there were both constraints and objectives
impacting on the chosen features of the HSF. There were constitutional limitations to all
energy-related revenues first going directly into the fund. As regards the motivation for the
SIP, the authorities underscored the need to safeguard the funding of strategic investments
from the year-to-year vicissitudes in international energy prices and noted that opportunities
for such investments might unexpectedly turn up in the midst of a budget year. They
emphasized that the investments would ultimately still be subject to parliamentary oversight
even if outside of the normal budgetary process. As regards the threshold oil prices, they
indicated that a clear exposition of the mechanism for their calculation, including the
reference world market prices, would be included in the final legislation.
B. Monetary and Exchange Rate Policies
25.
The challenges for monetary and exchange rate policy are also framed by the
expected continued strength of the balance of payments position. The discussions focused
on the central bank’s objectives and operational instruments for managing the liquidity
arising from the expansionary fiscal position; and how to address the inevitable pressures for
a real appreciation coming from the large terms of trade improvement.
26.
The authorities stated that the central bank’s key objective has been internal
and external price stability. Liquidity is viewed by the authorities as an intermediate target
and the Central Bank’s repo rate is used to signal the direction of monetary policy. With the
transmission mechanism operating through interest rates, open market operations should, in
principle, be undertaken to vary the quantity of liquidity only at the margin. In practice, the
CBTT carries out large volumes of open market operations and effectively also determines
the nominal exchange rate, which has remained virtually unchanged vis-à-vis the U.S. dollar
since 1999.4 Notwithstanding the stability of the exchange rate, the mission acknowledged
that there was some scope for monetary policy affecting liquidity owing to the variable
interest rate margin (see paragraph 8) and a home-currency bias.
27.
The mission noted the signs of emerging capacity constraints, including the step
increase in nonfood inflation and the tight labor market (Box 3). The authorities
considered recent price developments as less indicative of emerging inflationary pressures
4

The exchange rate is classified by the Fund as a de facto peg.

Box 3. Labor Market Developments
Unemployment has recently fallen to an all-time low and labor participation rates are at historical
highs. The official unemployment rate, which uses a wide definition to include discouraged workers, has
steadily declined from its peak in the late 1980s of 22 percent to an average of 8.3 percent in 2004. The
labor participation rate, which was as low as 56 percent in 1990, is now at a historical high of 63 percent.
The latter is mostly due to the sharp increase in the participation rate for women.

The current economic boom has led to increased demand for labor across most industries and all
skill levels, although financially the educated appear to have benefited disproportionately.
Unemployment rates have fallen for both sexes and all age groups. The unemployment rate for those with
some tertiary education was always low but the rates for those with lower education has also recently
fallen. In terms of industries, employment has increased in all sectors except agriculture. The declining
agricultural employment is due, in large part, to the closure of the state-owned sugar company Caroni in
2003, which led to the separation of 9,000 employees or 1½ percent of the current labor force. Available
data on income suggest that the labor market remains particularly tight for skilled categories—average
monthly income for agricultural and elementary workers has not kept pace with inflation.

- 16 than did the mission. They emphasized the role of food prices in the recent increases in
headline inflation. Wage increases, especially at the lower end of the skill spectrum, were
also still relatively muted. The authorities, nevertheless, noted their recent moves to increase
interest rates and indicated that the central bank would continue to ensure that liquidity did
not fan inflation further.
28.
The mission noted the pressures for a real appreciation, and pointed to the
limits to monetary policy successfully addressing these pressures under the present
exchange rate policy. Ideally, the current account surplus would be sterilized through fiscal
savings. In the absence of a sufficient fiscal effort, however, a real appreciation may be
unavoidable. Notwithstanding the earlier slackness in the labor market, dollar wages for
skilled labor had already increased significantly during 2001–04 and the current tight market
presaged further wage pressures. With an open capital account, the central bank’s scope to
influence interest rates beyond a certain point was, however, necessarily limited by the
current exchange rate regime. Under these circumstances, the choice was whether real
appreciation occurred through inflation or by other means. Pointing to the adverse impact on
poor household incomes of inflation, the mission recommended instead nominal exchange
rate flexibility. Given the unchanged exchange rate in recent years and the complex structural
features of the foreign exchange market, moves toward greater flexibility would, however,
have to be carefully designed and implemented so as not to be destabilizing. At the same
time, the monetary framework would need to be geared more toward explicitly targeting
inflation.
29.
The authorities considered the current level of the real exchange rate to be
appropriate and pointed to safety valves that would ameliorate pressures for
appreciation. They explained that the business community did not appear to view the current
level of the exchange rate as detrimental to competitiveness. Available data for 2001–04
showed that real wage growth still lagged real nonenergy GDP growth and unit labor costs in
manufacturing were continuing to decline, albeit at a slower rate than before (see Box 3). As

competitiveness.

- 17 C. Structural Issues
30.
The authorities view structural reforms as complementing the government’s
efforts to create space for the private sector to grow, in particular in the nonenergy
sector. The current focus is on tax and financial sector reform. In this vein, the authorities are
also seeking to improve the business climate. The discussions touched on these areas, as well
as on utility prices, privatization, and labor market policies.
31.
Trinidad and Tobago is in the process of implementing a comprehensive tax
reform. As regards the energy sector, reflecting its changing nature and increasing
complexity, a decision has been made to distinguish between the regime governing gas and
oil. The new regimes contain some provisions that will apply retroactively. The authorities
are considering plans for taxation of the nonenergy sector that go beyond the measures
introduced with the new budget. These latter measures, to be phased in over several years
entail broadening the tax base and reducing the complexity of the system with an aim to
increasing its efficiency and predictability. The budget speech for FY 2005/06 announced
that consistent with Fund technical assistance advice, a Tax Policy Unit was being
established in the Ministry of Finance with a mandate for the continuous reform of the tax
regime.
32.
Financial sector reforms seek to consolidate and strengthen Trinidad and
Tobago’s role as a regional financial center. The mission noted the FSAP’s finding that
while banks appeared well-capitalized and profitable, the nonbanking sector was more
vulnerable, including on account of regional exposure. The financial system as a whole was
also significantly exposed to the risks of a reversal in energy prices, particularly when
accompanied by a decline in real estate and equity prices, and a significant increase in
interest rates. Given the pre-eminence of conglomerates in the financial system, introducing a
framework for consolidated supervision appeared urgent. Also, given the regional exposure
of Trinidadian financial entities, cross-border activities should be carefully monitored.
33.
While agreeing with the thrust of the FSAP recommendations, the authorities
emphasized capacity constraints and the need to prioritize measures. They were pleased
that the FSAP had broadly endorsed their existing reform program. Pointing to the very
heavy reform agenda, the authorities indicated, however, that prioritization and sequencing of
reforms will have to be undertaken carefully and noted that this will inevitably require time.
They also noted the requirement for large amounts of technical assistance, which the mission
offered its support in helping to coordinate.
34.
The authorities emphasized their efforts to create and strengthen a pro-business
culture, including through their interventions in the labor market. A paper prepared
under the aegis of the Enabling Environment Committee—the Prime Minister’s Standing
Committee on Business Development, has produced a comprehensive list of impediments to
business formation, growth and development. The authorities also pointed to some specific
sectors, such as filming, printing and packaging, and food processing that had been identified
as having potential and possibly meriting governmental support. As regards the labor market,
the authorities noted that the budgetary public employment work programs had a strong
training component and were administered in a manner that encouraged entrepreneurship.
Reported labor shortages by the business community did not constitute a valid justification

- 18 for discontinuing the programs as, in addition to enhancing skill levels, they provided a social
safety net for the more vulnerable members of society.
35.
The mission encouraged the authorities to consider reinvigorating privatization
and adjusting utility prices to spur private sector development. It noted a marked
increase in the number of statutory bodies and public enterprises at the same time as the
privatization program appeared to have petered out. The authorities emphasized that the new
bodies being set up did not represent an expansion of the state into the private sphere. Rather,
it was an attempt to bring private sector expertise to bear on the problem of government
inefficiencies. As regards public utilities, noting the business community’s complaints about
inefficiencies, the mission suggested that tariff adjustments to cover the currently large
financial losses could also help improve service provision. The authorities indicated that the
petition for the increase in electricity tariffs was currently being reviewed and that for water
would follow shortly.
V. STAFF APPRAISAL
36.
Trinidad and Tobago is in an enviable position in many respects, but one that
also comes with several challenges. The increase in oil prices provides an opportunity to
secure sustainable high living standards and improvements in social indicators. Maximizing
the gains from the energy windfall requires, however, a careful balancing between meeting
the demands of the moment and the needs of the future. It also calls for vigilance in
safeguarding against vulnerabilities and a prudent mix of fiscal, monetary, and structural
policies that help ensure that the public sector is getting value for its money, and that private
sector competitiveness is maintained and enhanced.
37.
While mindful of the potential long-term benefits of increasing investment and
reducing taxes, the relatively sudden and very large expansion of the nonenergy deficit
gives pause for concern. Fundamentally, there is a question about whether there exists the
institutional capacity in the short run to absorb the increase in government expenditures,
particularly current expenditures, in the most effective manner. There are also inflationary
pressures emerging and the risks of Dutch disease. Finally, with the public sector so
increasingly dependent on energy revenues, an unanticipated downward swing in energy
prices could exact significant economic costs.
38.
Accordingly, increasing the share of energy revenues that is put aside for the
future could provide several benefits. It will go some way toward securing the
sustainability of public finances and help guard against the risks of an unexpected worsening
of the terms of trade. It could also shield the economy from the adverse consequences of a
pro-cyclical fiscal stance, in terms of high inflation, loss of competitiveness, and a “boom
bust” pattern of economic growth. Finally, by spacing expenditures over time, it would help
ensure that the marginal rates of return on public spending remain high.
39.
A permanent and well-designed oil fund is one way to ensure that these benefits
are realized. The authorities are committed to establishing such a fund and the staff supports
the ultimate objectives that lie behind the HSF. The HSF should, however, not be used for
extra-budgetary spending. As a general rule, all public expenditures should compete for the
same scarce resources within the standard budget process.

- 19 40.
A public expenditure review and a fiscal ROSC could be useful inputs to policymaking. The recent sharp increases in expenditures have underscored the potential benefits
of carrying out a comprehensive public expenditure review with external assistance, in line
with previous staff recommendations. Inter alia, there are now numerous social programs on
the budget that, in at least some cases, appear to have multiple objectives. A review could
help increase the efficiency of public resources, including by suggesting ways to better target
and focus public interventions. The staff welcomes the authorities’ intentions to ensure that
there remain adequate checks and balances, such as monitoring and reporting requirements,
for the new expenditure executing agencies. In this regard, it reiterates the potential benefits
of preparing a fiscal ROSC.
41.
Exchange rate policy will require a reconsideration in the face of the strong
external inflows and widening nonenergy fiscal deficits. In the absence of sufficient fiscal
tightening, the change in fundamentals represented by a possibly permanent ratcheting
upwards of oil prices is likely to require a real exchange rate adjustment. Increased flexibility
of the exchange rate will enable the authorities to better manage the pressures for a real
appreciation without stoking inflation.
42.
The staff welcomes the authorities’ efforts to reform the financial sector.
Trinidad and Tobago has embarked on a program that, upon completion, will further secure
its position as the financial center of the Caribbean. The scope of the reform program is
ambitious and the staff concurs that it will take some time to fully implement. The authorities
are encouraged to remain steadfast in implementing the reform agenda, a critical element of
which is appropriately to strengthen supervision. The international community, for its part,
will have to play its part in providing the necessary technical assistance.
43.
Structural reforms to support the growth of the private sector will have to
remain an integral element of the agenda. In this regard, the staff welcomes the efforts to
reform taxation of the nonenergy sector, which is a key consideration for investors. Against
the background of sharply rising expenditures, it reiterates, however, the importance of
taking a more gradual approach to tax reform—especially given the uncertain revenue and
distributional impacts and the need to assure predictability about future tax levels for
investors. More generally, to enhance growth, the authorities are encouraged to focus their
efforts on improving the overall business environment rather than seeking to pick winners
and losers, as the state might not be in the best position to choose among competing
industries. The government can, however, help create the necessary space for private
enterprises by strengthening service provision, including by public utilities, and by
reinvigorating its privatization program.
44.
The staff recommends that the next Article IV consultation be held on the
standard 12-month cycle.

1/ Derived as [r - g - ρ(1+g) + εα(1+r)]/(1+g+ρ+gρ) times previous period debt stock, with r = nominal effective interest rate on external debt; ρ = change in domestic GDP deflator in US dollar terms, g = real GDP growth rate,
ε = nominal appreciation (increase in dollar value of domestic currency), and α = share of domestic-currency denominated debt in total external debt.
2/ The contribution from price and exchange rate changes is defined as [-ρ(1+g) + εα(1+r)]/(1+g+ρ+gρ) times previous period debt stock. ρ increases with an appreciating domestic currency (ε > 0) and rising inflation (based on
GDP deflator).
3/ For projection, line includes the impact of price and exchange rate changes.
4/ Defined as current account deficit, plus amortization on medium- and long-term debt, plus short-term debt at end of previous period.
5/ The key variables include real GDP growth; nominal interest rate; dollar deflator growth; and both noninterest current account and nondebt inflows in percent of GDP.
6/ Long-run, constant balance that stabilizes the debt ratio assuming that key variables (real GDP growth, nominal interest rate, dollar deflator growth, and non-debt inflows in percent of GDP) remain at their levels of the last

TRINIDAD AND TOBAGO—RELATIONS WITH THE WORLD BANK
(As of June 10, 2005)
The World Bank’s last Country Assistance Strategy for Trinidad and Tobago was discussed
at the Board in 1999. The CAS was conceived as a first step within a 10-year framework and
was approved for the period up to 2002. The program articulated a 10-year development
agenda for the country, focusing on: (i) facilitating private sector led employment generation
and entrepreneurship in labor-intensive agriculture and export services sectors by (a)
streamlining investment approval process; (b) removing labor market rigidities; (c) reforming
the agricultural sector; and (d) encouraging the services sector; (ii) increasing human capital
through investment in education, health and social programs, notably by improving
(a) healthcare facilities; and (b) targeting and efficiency of social programs; (iii) improving
the delivery of public services to support private sector-led economic diversification; and
(iv) ensuring environmental sustainability of growth.
The current World Bank program includes two ongoing projects with total commitment of
US$30.8 million (a Postal Service Reform project in the amount of US$10.8 million and an
HIV/AIDS Prevention and Control Project in the amount of US$20 million), of which
US$22.0 million is undisbursed.
I. PROJECTS
Postal Service Reform: The Postal Service Reform project (US$10.8 million) assists the
Government in the privatization of the Postal Service, with the objective of reducing public
sector losses while improving the quality and efficiency of the postal service.
HIV/AIDS Prevention and Control Project: The project (US$ 20.0 million) was approved
in June 2003 and is funded under the Multi-Country APL for the Caribbean Region, with the
following objectives: (i) curbing the spread of HIV/AIDS epidemic; (ii) reducing the
morbidity and mortality attributed to HIV/AIDS; (iii) improving the quality of life for
persons living with HIV/AIDS; and (iv) developing a sustainable organizational and
institutional framework for managing the HIV/AIDS epidemic over the longer term.
II. ECONOMIC AND SECTOR WORK
A Financial Sector Assessment Program by the World Bank and the IMF is ongoing.
Trinidad and Tobago also benefits from World Bank regional studies, such as the recentlycompleted report “A Time to Choose—Caribbean Development in the 21st Century.”

APPENDIX III

TRINIDAD AND TOBAGO—RELATIONS WITH THE INTER-AMERICAN DEVELOPMENT BANK
(As of June 17, 2005)
In November 2004, the IDB Board approved the new Country Strategy with Trinidad and
Tobago. This document reflects the extensive process of dialogue with all major stakeholders
in the country, and the agreements with Government on three principal and inter-dependent
areas of strategic focus. These three areas are: (i) promoting private sector development to
achieve economic diversification; (ii) promoting public sector modernization to improve
efficiency and effectiveness; and (iii) promoting social development through improved public
services.
In each area, criteria have been established to guide conceptualization and design of
operations, and also to guide program dialogue to define new operational priorities consistent
with the strategy. The strategy recognizes the particular characteristics of Tobago, and pays
attention to considering, as a crosscutting feature of IDB programs, gender issues. The
strategy allows for flexibility to expand this program in line with possible Bank lending
directly to the private sector and/or to support new operations in the out-years stemming from
the public sector reform “road map” exercise that is now underway. An integral of the
strategy is to focus on timely completion of projects and programs currently in execution,
and achievement of their development objectives.
As of June 17, 2005, the IDB has an active public sector lending portfolio of seven loans
with a total value of US$409 million, of which US$191 million (47 percent) has been
disbursed. In addition to loans for the public sector, the IDB lends directly to the private
sector and provides grant resources through technical cooperations. MIF, an IDB institution
providing grant resources for private sector development, has four operations in execution for
an amount of US$2.8 million, of which US$0.8 million (29 %) has been disbursed.
Following is a brief description of the Bank’s public sector loans in execution by strategic
area.
Promoting private sector development to achieve economic diversification
The IDB is in the process of preparing a Private Sector Development Strategy, which will
complement the efforts of the ongoing Business Climate Initiative. The Initiative calls for:
(i) a Diagnostic Assessment to identify a prioritized list of issues to improve the business
climate; (ii) agreement on a Business Climate Action Plan, the implementation of which the
Bank would support with an array of operational instruments; and (iii) agreement on a system
to monitor and evaluate the effectiveness of the Action Plan’s implementation.
In March 2003, the IDB approved a loan of US$5.0 million for a Trade Sector Support
Program. The operation was developed under a new sector facility and its main objective is
to improve the international trade performance of Trinidad and Tobago. That goal will be
met by strengthening the country’s technical and institutional capacity to formulate and
implement trade policy, to participate effectively in trade negotiations, to implement trade
agreements, and to increase and diversify exports.

- 37 -

APPENDIX III

In 1996, the IDB approved US$120.0 million in lending for the National Highway Program.
The program aims to improve and sustain road services provided by the main national road
network, reduce road transportation costs, and provide incentives for the development of
small contractors and microenterprises.
Promoting public sector modernization to improve efficiency
In December 2003, the IDB approved a loan of US$5 million for a Public Sector Reform
Initiation Facility. This facility is aimed at the development and initial implementation of a
long-term strategy to modernize the public sector. The plan or “road map”, which will result
from the project through a consensus-building approach, should be ready by December 2006.
It will include actions to improve the composition of public spending by optimizing the size,
management, structure, organization, functioning, human resources, legal framework,
accountability, and service delivery mechanisms of the Government.
In 1995, the IDB approved a US$8.0 million reimbursable technical cooperation project to
assist the Government of Trinidad and Tobago in implementing the Agriculture Sector
Reform Program. This technical cooperation project is expected to assist agribusiness in the
identification of opportunities, and to strengthen the long-term institutional capacity of the
Ministry of Agriculture.
Promoting social development through improved public services
In 2002, the IDB approved funding in the amount of US$32.0 million to support the National
Settlements Program-Stage Two. The general objective is to establish a more equitable,
transparent and sustainable system of affordable housing, and more specifically to improve
housing conditions for low-income groups. The program includes support for squatter
upgrading, family subsidies and institutional capacity building.
In 1999, the IDB approved financing in the amount of US$l05.0 million for a Secondary
Education Program. This program’s objectives are aimed at providing equitable, high quality
secondary education; updating educational content and teaching methodologies; and
developing a more efficient management of resources at the central and local levels.
In 1996, the IDB approved a US$134.0 million loan for a Health Sector Reform Program in
order to strengthen the policy-making, planning and management capacity of the Ministry of
Health. The program is financing activities aimed at separating health services from
financing and regulatory responsibilities, shifting public expenditures, redirecting private
expenditures to priority areas and finding cost effective solutions; establishing new
administrative and employment structures that encourage accountability, increased
autonomy, improved productivity and efficiency; reducing preventable morbidity and
mortality through lifestyle changes and social interventions; and financial sustainability of
the service delivery system.

TRINIDAD AND TOBAGO—STATISTICAL ISSUES
Trinidad and Tobago produces a wide range of economic and financial statistics that are
largely based on sound methodological principles, and data provision is adequate for
surveillance purposes. The national internet website where many of these statistics are
reported can be accessed through links in the IMF’s Data Standards Bulletin Board. On
September 30, 2004 Trinidad and Tobago started participating in the IMF’s General Data
Dissemination System and hopes to subscribe to the Special Data Dissemination Standard in
the near future. However, institutional arrangements need to be strengthened to facilitate
improved compilation and reporting as well as collaboration among the central bank, the
central statistical office, and the ministry of finance, planning, and development, and to avoid
duplication of data production efforts and some inconsistencies across sectoral databases.
Real sector
The Central Statistical Office (CSO) makes good use of available source data to produce
annual national accounts. In applying the recommendations of STA technical assistance
(2000), the CSO has revised the real GDP series by rebasing it from 1985 to 2000, improved
the methodology for calculating production at each sector level, and switched from valuation at
factor cost to market prices. This particularly involved the inclusion of the large gas sector
which came on stream in 2000; and changing the estimation techniques in the
telecommunications sector (by using the number of call units as opposed to the number of
callers) and the financial sector (by constructing individual extrapolators for each sub-industry
and then aggregating them up). The central statistical office does not currently produce
quarterly GDP estimates. Although the central bank currently constructs quarterly indicators of
real GDP, eventually the central statistical office should assume exclusive responsibility for
compiling quarterly national accounts. A recent STA mission on national accounts in
September 2005 found that institutional weaknesses at the CSO remain; although there is no
serious shortage of staff that could affect the production of the statistics, a reallocation would
improve efficiency. The mission encouraged the CSO to start compiling quarterly GDP
estimates. Work is well advanced in compiling a supply and use table that should improve the
accuracy of the estimates.
The retail price index has been rebased from 1985 to January 2003 reflecting the 1997/98
Household Budgetary Survey, and correcting the aggregation formula. The CSO should ensure
that a similar methodology is used to revamp the producer price index.
Fiscal accounts
Data on central government operations and debt are compiled separately by the Ministry of
Finance, Planning, and Development (MFPD) and the central bank, and show significant
differences. The authorities should work to reconcile on a regular basis these two sets of data.
Transfers to the revenue stabilization fund are recorded as an expenditure item, but should be
recorded as a financial flow below the line. Data on the nonbank financing are derived as a
residual owing to the absence of data collection. The national classification system for

- 39 -

government transactions and debt of the central government seems to be sufficiently detailed
for use in compiling data according to GFSM 1986 methodology, although no data have been
submitted for use in the GFSY. Also, there is no evidence of significant migration to the use of
GFSM 2001, which should be initiated.
Data on selected public enterprises and statutory bodies are being compiled by the investment
division, the domestic debt division, and the budget division of the MFPD. The data from these
divisions have to be reconciled, particularly on the transfers for debt servicing, transfers for
government capital projects, guaranteed debt, and letters of comfort. The capital expenditure
on behalf of government should be classified as capital expenditure instead of other goods and
services.
Monetary accounts
The major recommendations of the IMF in monetary and financial statistics have been
implemented by the authorities, leading to a substantial improvement in the analytical
usefulness of the monetary statistics. There are, however, some areas for improvement. The
monthly monetary account for other depository corporations (ODCs) currently covers only
financial institutions that are licensed by the central bank under the 1993 Financial Institutions
Act. Nonlicensed ODCs only report voluntarily on a quarterly basis. No data are reported by
credit unions and the Post Office Savings Bank. The lack of these data have prevented the
compilation of a more comprehensive Depository Corporation Survey. Currently only a few
commercial banks are involved in limited transactions in options and swaps. If the use of these
instruments becomes more significant, the central bank should initiate reporting of data on
them in the monetary statistics. The authorities should also consider developing systems for
reporting balance sheet accounts for the mutual funds, with a view to compiling a more
comprehensive financial survey in the future.
Balance of payments
The balance of payments data conform to many of the standards of the BPM5. The Private
Sector Capital Flows and Investor Perception survey needs to be improved on the quantity and
quality of responses, and estimating market value shares. There are sizable differences between
some items of the external public debt compiled by the central bank and the ministry of
finance, planning, and development. The central bank should expand its current debt reporting
system to include comprehensive coverage of external loans and debt of the entire public
sector, as well as publicly nonguaranteed debt.

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2005 Article IV Consultation with
Trinidad and Tobago
On November 11, 2005, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF)
concluded the Article IV consultation with Trinidad and Tobago.1
Background
Trinidad and Tobago’s economy, which is endowed with large energy reserves, is experiencing
a strong energy sector-based expansion. The energy sector already accounts for about
40 percent of GDP, over 80 percent of exports, and approximately half of government revenues.
However, its contribution to employment is less than 5 percent. Within the Caribbean, Trinidad
and Tobago has become a major financial center and a source of capital for regional entities.
Trinidad and Tobago is one of the larger Caribbean nations in terms of GDP and population.
Its energy wealth has enabled it to achieve one of the highest standards of living in the region.
Nevertheless, income inequality and poverty rates are only at about regional averages.
Macroeconomic performance and financial developments are currently being driven by a highly
favorable external environment. Surging oil prices have strengthened the external current
account balance, financed an expansion of aggregate demand, and contributed to high levels of
liquidity in the financial system. There are tentative signs that the economy is producing at, or
near, capacity and inflationary pressures are emerging.
The economy is growing robustly and unemployment has fallen to historical lows. Real GDP
grew by 6½ percent during 2004. While this is lower than the outturn of 13 percent growth
during 2003, the latter was driven primarily by the coming on stream of some large energy
projects. The nonenergy sector has remained vigorous, growing by just under 6 percent during
1

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On
return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the
Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the
Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the
country's authorities.

-2–
2004 on the back of a surge in government spending financed by the oil bonanza. The latter has
also led to a boom in construction. Under the official definition of unemployment, which includes
some discouraged workers, the average unemployment rate stood at 8¼ percent in 2004, the
lowest in decades.
The balance of payments is in large surplus, driven by exports, which rose by US$1.2 billion
(10 percent of GDP) in 2004, significantly outpacing import growth and lifting the current
account surplus to 14½ percent of GDP from 9 percent of GDP in 2003. While some of the
higher current account receipts were offset by private capital outflows, the overall balance of
payments surplus still doubled to US$0.7 billion (6 percent of GDP). With oil prices rising
further, these trends are accelerating in 2005—the foreign assets of both the commercial banks
and the central bank have continued to rise rapidly this year.
There has been a substantial widening of the nonenergy fiscal deficit (the overall deficit,
excluding energy revenues) although the overall budget balance remains in surplus on account
of buoyant energy revenues. The budget for FY 2005/06 envisages a significant further
expansion of the nonenergy deficit, due to a reduction in nonenergy revenues (from lower
income tax rates, and other changes to both direct and indirect taxes), as well as a further
increase in non-interest expenditures. High energy prices as well as some recent changes to
the energy tax regime should, however, lead to increased receipts from the oil and gas sector.
Monetary conditions have largely been accommodative, although signs of accelerating inflation
have led to a recent shift toward tightening. The monetization of energy receipts by the
government to finance the nonenergy deficit is the major source of liquidity injection into the
financial system. Despite a sustained freeze of public utility tariffs and gasoline prices, headline
inflation has crept up to 7 percent for the 12-month period ending in September 2005, up from
2¾ percent a year and a half ago. A significant part of this reflects movements in volatile food
prices. Nevertheless, core inflation is also up and the Central Bank of Trinidad and Tobago
(CBTT) has raised the benchmark repo rate on three occasions this year, each time by 25 basis
points.
Financial markets have generally been buoyant in reflection of the ample liquidity. Insurance,
pension funds, finance companies and mutual funds have all experienced rapid expansion, with
mutual fund investments reaching roughly two-thirds of bank assets and stock market
capitalization approaching 140 percent of GDP in 2004. The financial system as a whole
increased credit to the private sector by 18 percent in 2004, a leap compared with single-digit
annual growth since 2001. Banking soundness indicators generally improved in 2004.
Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors noted the currently highly favorable external environment for Trinidad and
Tobago and the benefits that were accruing from surging energy export prices and track record
of strong economic policies. Economic growth was robust, unemployment was at historical lows,
and government finances, as well as the balance of payments, were registering large surpluses.
Financial markets had generally remained buoyant and credit ratings were up. Directors
remarked that the current circumstances, where high energy prices were driving
macroeconomic developments, provided a unique opportunity for Trinidad and Tobago to make
significant progress toward securing sustainable high living standards for its population.

-3–
Directors noted that maximizing the gains from the energy windfall required a prudent mix of
fiscal, monetary, and structural policies. Such policies should ensure that the public sector was
getting value for its money and private sector competitiveness was maintained and enhanced.
Directors considered that a careful balancing of priorities and policies was called for.
While mindful of the potential long-term benefits of reducing tax rates and increasing capital
spending, Directors expressed some apprehensions about the recent significant expansion of
the nonenergy fiscal deficit, i.e., the deficit excluding energy revenues. They noted that the
plans for current spending needed to be assessed against institutional limitations and the
economy’s capacity to absorb the higher levels of expenditures. There were, in particular,
emerging concerns about inflation and the risks of Dutch disease down the road. Directors also
indicated that the expanding nonenergy deficit rendered the public finances vulnerable to
sudden downward swings in energy prices.
Against this background, Directors called on the authorities to consider increasing the share of
energy revenues that is saved. Noting the limited energy reserves, Directors underscored the
importance of ensuring long-term sustainability of public finances. They also emphasized the
benefits greater savings would provide in terms of helping shield the economy from the adverse
consequences of a pro-cyclical fiscal stance, in terms of high inflation, loss of competitiveness,
and a “boom bust” pattern of economic growth.
Directors praised the authorities’ efforts to simplify the nonenergy tax regime to increase its
efficiency and predictability. They indicated a preference, however, for a more gradual approach
to the reforms, given their uncertain revenue and distributional impacts in the context of a
widening nonenergy deficit, and the need to assure predictability about future tax levels for
investors. Directors welcomed the intention to establish a Tax Policy Unit in the Ministry of
Finance with a mandate for continuous reform of the tax regime.
Directors underscored the role of institutions in ensuring that the benefits from the current high
oil prices were realized. In this regard, they welcomed the authorities’ intentions to establish a
permanent energy fund. Noting the importance of designing the fund well from the outset,
Directors advised the authorities to avoid using the fund for extra budgetary spending and urged
them to channel all public spending to compete for scarce resources within the standard
budgetary process in parliament.
Directors welcomed the authorities’ assurances that there would be adequate checks and
balances on the special new agencies that were being set up to expedite expenditure execution.
However, most Directors encouraged the authorities to consider reforming and restructuring the
existing government apparatus, rather than setting up new entities. In any case, Directors
suggested that a comprehensive public expenditure review (PER), carried out with external
assistance, and a fiscal Report on Standards and Codes (ROSC) prepared with assistance from
the Fund, could be useful inputs to policy-making at this time. They noted the potential benefits
of these studies—the PER in helping identify ways to better target and focus public
interventions; and the ROSC in helping strengthen budgetary management processes and
accountability.
Looking forward, and given the strong external inflows and widening nonenergy fiscal deficits,
most Directors advised a reconsideration of exchange rate policy to achieve greater exchange

-4–
rate flexibility. Directors noted the pressures for a real appreciation and pointed to the limits to
monetary policy alone successfully addressing these pressures in an environment of improving
terms of trade and expanding fiscal nonenergy deficits, although increased investments abroad
by the private sector would mitigate to a certain extent the appreciation pressures stemming
from the strengthened current account position. They considered that in the absence of
sufficient fiscal tightening or changes in private sector behavior, the choice was whether real
appreciation occurred through inflation, which would have an adverse impact on poor
households, or by other means.
Directors encouraged the authorities to take advantage of the current favorable economic
environment to press ahead with structural reforms to support private sector led growth. In this
regard, continued progress on utility prices, privatization, and labor market reforms will be
critical. Directors praised the authorities’ efforts to reform the financial sector. They welcomed
the FSAP findings, urged the authorities to undertake the necessary legal reforms, and agreed
that the Fund would help coordinate the necessary technical assistance following from the
FSAP recommendations. Directors called on other technical assistance providers to extend
support to the authorities’ reform program. They concurred that the authorities’ financial sector
reform program, upon its successful completion, should help further secure Trinidad’s position
as the financial center of the Caribbean.

Statement by Eduardo Loyo and Executive Director for Trinidad and Tobago
and Charles de Silva, Senior Advisor to Executive Director
November 11, 2005
High oil prices and increasing energy sector output have continued to provide the
stimulus for expansion of the economy of Trinidad and Tobago, which marked eleven
consecutive years of strong growth in 2004. More recent performance has been equally
robust with forthcoming data expected to show growth in the first half of the year remaining
in the region of the 6.5 percent seen in 2004.
Trinidad and Tobago’s economic strategy has focused on escaping the historical
narrow dependence on oil extraction through diversification of its energy sector. This has
involved the intensive development of natural gas resources and the establishment of a largescale petrochemical and other gas-based industries, a process which was deepened in 2004
with the start-up of two new petrochemical plants. This expansion in capacity helped to fuel a
robust energy sector growth rate of 7.9 percent notwithstanding the fact that crude oil
production fell significantly during the period. Non-energy sector growth also strengthened
appreciably in 2004, though much of this dynamism derived from developments in the
energy sector.
Although inflationary pressures were relatively subdued earlier in the year, a sharp
pick-up took place in the fourth quarter of 2004 and has been sustained into the current year,
pushing the 12-month headline rate to 6.9 percent by September. The acceleration is being
fueled largely by food prices, which in September registered a 12-month increase of 23
percent compared with an increase of 2.6 percent in core (non-food) inflation. Rising import
prices have also been an important factor in both food and non-food inflation.
The resurgence in inflation and the accompanying rise in inflationary expectations
have prompted a shift in the central bank’s monetary policy away from the accommodative
stance in place since mid-2002. The bank increased its policy interest rate on three occasions
in 2005, from 5 percent to 5.75 percent, triggering a rise of similar magnitude in commercial
banks’ prime lending rates and inducing increases in money market rates as well as in longterm interest rates. In explaining the policy shift, the bank also signaled concern about
growing demand pressures in the foreign exchange market and the narrowing of interest rate
differentials with the United States, which could increase incentives for capital outflows.
The robust growth of the economy has had a positive impact on the labor market,
with the unemployment rate averaging 8.4 percent in 2004, down from 10.5 percent the
previous year, while more recent data show the rate declining further to 8 percent in June.
Heightened non-oil sector activity, particularly in the construction sector as the government
accelerates its housing program, and the continuation of construction projects in the energy
sector seem set to drive unemployment even further down in the months ahead.
With regard to capacity constraints, the authorities acknowledge that there has been a
visible tightening of labor market conditions, which they see as a key source of vulnerability

-2for the economy. In response, the government has been attempting to address labor
constraints in various sectors of the economy through the importation of skilled personnel,
including medical personnel to address shortages in the health sector. At the same time, firms
in the construction sector have been importing skilled labor from the Caribbean area and
other sources to meet existing shortfalls.
On the external front, booming energy prices and increases in export volumes in 2004
enabled Trinidad and Tobago to double the balance of payments surplus of the previous year.
However, the capital account continued to reflect a deficit, partly as a result of the domestic
capital market’s expanding role as a regional supplier of funds. Reflecting the economy’s
growing strength, two major international credit rating agencies announced upgrades of
Trinidad and Tobago’s external debt ratings, from BBB+ to A- in the case of Standard and
Poor’s, and from Baa2 to Baa3 in the case of Moody’s.
The Trinidad and Tobago authorities broadly share the staff’s assessment of the
outlook for the economy and of the challenges that lie ahead. While prospects for growth
appear bright over the medium term, the authorities are mindful of the growing risks to
macroeconomic stability and longer-term sustainability as the economy approaches the limits
of its capacity. With signs of an inflationary takeoff already present in the economy, the
authorities view containment of this trend as a key short-term priority and avoidance of
Dutch disease risks as a critical medium-term challenge. On this latter score, they consider
the threat of Dutch disease to be less severe than during the energy boom of the 1970s given
the structural changes the economy has undergone since then.
Monetary policy remains firmly committed to maintaining domestic price stability,
which the authorities acknowledge is shaping to be an increasingly demanding challenge in
the context of continuing strong liquidity growth. The central bank intends to remain vigilant
and to act decisively to mitigate inflationary pressures. The exchange rate will be managed to
provide support to the goals of monetary policy and to respond flexibly to developments in
the real economy. At the same time, the central bank, in conjunction with the Fund, is
continuing to look closely at ways of addressing structural peculiarities in the foreign
exchange market, including its highly oligopolistic nature, to enable it to function more
effectively.
Notwithstanding the challenges ahead, the authorities are determined to capitalize on
the opportunity offered by the present circumstances to raise the long-term growth potential
of the economy, by scaling up the level of investment in human capital and in social and
economic infrastructure. Education has emerged as a key focus of the 2005/06 budget,
highlights of which included the introduction of free tuition for nationals enrolled at public
tertiary institutions and plans for an ambitious program to construct three new campuses for
the University of Trinidad and Tobago. The UTT was recently established to ensure an
output of industry-ready graduates with specialized skills and to strengthen the focus on
research and development activities that are relevant to the needs of the country and industry
related. Whereas these expenditures would increase the non-energy deficit, especially in the
short term owing to construction outlays, the improvement in the quality of the labor force is

-3expected over time to contribute towards a more sustained development of the non-energy
sector.
With the aim of accelerating infrastructural development in line with its long-term
vision and increasing the rate of implementation of its investment program, the government
proposes to outsource project management responsibilities for identified projects to fifteen
special-purpose state entities. This approach will enable the government to address the
challenges of skill shortages and cumbersome bureaucratic procedures that have traditionally
constrained implementation of the PSIP, but is not intended as a permanent mechanism. The
authorities have stressed their commitment to the highest standards of good governance,
transparency, and accountability in the operations of these entities.
Our authorities fully share the view that raising the level of fiscal savings, as
recommended by staff, is an important element of macroeconomic policy, and of the strategy
to protect the budget from the volatility of oil prices and to share the benefits of the oil and
gas patrimony equitably across generations. With this in mind, the government has
reconceptualized its planned revenue stabilization fund as the Heritage and Stabilization
Fund and has substantially increased the size of its contributions pending formal
establishment of the Fund through enactment of legislation currently being prepared with the
assistance of an international consultant. While in the 2005 Budget the government had
undertaken to transfer TT$1.4 billion to the Interim Revenue Stabilization Fund, it in fact
transferred TT$2,593 million compared to TT$1,263.2 million in 2004. This brought the
balance in the Fund to TT$5439.0 million, equivalent to about US$907 million. For fiscal
2006 government has budgeted to deposit a further TT$1,862.8 million to the Fund.
Over the longer haul structural reforms of the non-energy tax regime are expected to
impact positively on the productivity of the tax base and ultimately help to attenuate the
expansionary effects of the non-energy deficit. As a first step, the government has moved to
simplify the direct tax regime by the removal of most special purpose allowances and has
identified as potential targets for reform some aspects of the indirect tax system that are
inhibiting its performance, including the level of excise tax rates, the extent of zero rating
under the VAT system, and the level of VAT refunds. The government is also actively
considering recommendations to expand the tax base through the introduction of a
comprehensive capital gains tax and a complete overhaul of the present property tax system.
In addition, the 2005-06 budget announced the establishment, in the Ministry of Finance, of a
Tax Policy Unit with a mandate that includes the continuous assessment of the tax regime in
Trinidad and Tobago.
In the financial system, the authorities are in the process of implementing an
ambitious and far-reaching program of institutional strengthening in line with the
government’s 2004 White Paper. A major focus of the reforms is the strengthening of
financial sector legislation, improving regulation and supervision, and the development of a
framework of cross-border supervision of financial conglomerates. The recently concluded
FSAP has identified a challenging agenda which the authorities are committed to
implementing as expeditiously as resources allow, and in this regard they have sought
technical assistance from the Fund. Nevertheless, given resource and capacity constraints the

-4authorities have stressed the need for prioritization and sequencing of reforms, in keeping
with their own assessment of what may be feasible within given timeframes.
In closing, our authorities thank Management and staff of the Fund for their excellent
support for Trinidad and Tobago and for the productive policy dialogue held in the course of
the recent Article IV mission.
