STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2014 ARTICLE IV CONSULTATION
July 23, 2014

KEY ISSUES
Context: Overheating concerns are fading. Mainland (i.e., non-oil-and-gas) growth
slowed to 2 percent and unemployment rose slightly to 3.5 percent in 2013. House
prices have been largely unchanged for a year.
Monetary policy: The monetary stance is appropriate. The economy remains roughly at
its potential, inflation is roughly at the 2.5 percent target, and moderating growth and
the stabilization in the house prices suggest reduced overheating risks.
Financial sector policy: Capital requirements for banks have been strengthened ahead
of the Basel III deadlines. Tighter capital standards for mortgage lending by both
domestic and foreign banks are being implemented in cooperation with Danish and
Swedish parent bank supervisors. With household debt and house prices still high,
tighter limits on mortgages should be retained even if the house prices soften further.
Fiscal policy: Fiscal policy has kept the non-oil deficit well within the fiscal rule’s limit on
spending from the sovereign wealth fund (the Government Pension Fund Global or
GPFG). However, there has still been a repeated fiscal stimulus in an economy roughly at
capacity. More conservative use of GPFG resources to set a neutral fiscal stance would
be preferable so long as the economy remains near potential.
Structural reforms: Improved competitiveness and increasing productivity growth
would enhance shift to a non-oil-and-gas growth model. Improved efficiency in local
public services and the selection of infrastructure projects, agricultural policy reforms,
more neutrality in the tax system, and further reform to pension and sickness and
disability systems would all help.
Consultation cycle: The Article IV discussion was conducted on the 12 month cycle in
light of the Board’s December 2013 decision to place Norway on the list of systemically
important financial sector jurisdictions.

CONTEXT: OVERHEATING CONCERNS ARE FADING
1.
A conservative minority government took office in October 2013, ending eight
years of Labor party-led governments. No major policy shift has taken place so far, but the
government’s economic policy platform emphasizes lower taxes, more infrastructure
investment, greater private ownership, and measures to improve productivity and
competitiveness. New challenges are emerging as oil-related investment is peaking and
competitiveness concerns are becoming more pressing.
2.
Both mainland and offshore growth slowed in 2013 (Figures 1 and 2). Mainland
growth moderated to 2.0 percent in part due to weak private consumption and mainland
investment, and lower oil production kept

The housing market has shown signs of cooling. House prices stabilized in mid2013 although staff estimates suggest a substantial overvaluation (the average estimate is
roughly 40 percent) in spite of a slight reduction in the valuation gap in 2013. A house price

correction that would bring house prices back to estimated equilibrium levels would trigger a
decline in consumption by 4 percent (See 2013 Nordic Regional Report, Selected Issues).
5.
Inflation rose toward the target partly
due to last year’s exchange rate depreciation.
The Norwegian krone depreciated by 10 percent in
nominal effective terms in 2013, and this pushed
the main inflation index (CPI-ATE) to about 2.5
percent early this year after several years below
the target (Figures 4).

The exchange rate is roughly in line
with fundamentals and desirable policies
based on EBA results (Box 1). The CPI-based
real effective exchange rate (REER) is about
5 percent below its 10-year historical average,
reflecting the recent depreciation of the
Norwegian krone (Figure 5). However, REER
deflated by unit labor costs (ULC) appreciated
significantly over the past decades. The recent
depreciation only modestly offsets the erosion
of competitiveness, and non-oil export market
share continued to decline (Figure 6).

Norway’s financial system is part of a tightly integrated Nordic-Baltic system.2
Inward links are mainly from Swedish and Danish banks with combined market shares of a
quarter to a third. The largest domestically-headquartered bank, DNB, has relatively small
external operations concentrated in Nordic and Baltic countries and the shipping industry.
More information on these links is in the Nordic Regional Report and the Baltic Cluster Report
from 2013 and 2014 respectively and their accompanying selected issues papers.

A Financial Sector Assessment Program mission is planned for late 2014/early 2015 for discussion with the
2015 Article IV consultation. Because Norway’s financial sector is considered to be systemically important,
subsequent financial stability assessments are expected to take place every five years.

broadly in line with fundamentals and desirable
policies: While the real exchange rate approach shows
no significant misalignment, the macroeconomic
balance approach suggests a mild undervaluation and
the external sustainability model points to the
opposite.
However, the ULC-based REER suggests an erosion
of long-term cost competitiveness. Norway’s ULCbased REER has appreciated significantly for the past
two decades, reflecting strong wage growth, and real
ULCs have doubled since 1995. The recent
depreciation of the Norwegian krone has reduced the
overvaluation at the margin, but the ULC-based REER
is still roughly 60 percent higher than the 1995 level.
This has been offset by terms of trade gains, but there
is no reason to expect these to persist indefinitely.
The declining non-oil export market share also
suggests weakening competitiveness. Robust GDP
growth driven by high oil prices and large terms of
trade gain has masked slowing productivity growth in
recent years. Despite the fiscal rule, the insulation from
the Dutch disease effects does not seem to have been
complete.

OUTLOOK AND RISKS: TAILWINDS FROM
OFFSHORE ACTIVITY ARE COMING TO A HALT
11.
The near-term outlook remains stable with moderate growth and inflation. With
the economy roughly at potential, mainland GDP growth is projected to slow to 1.9 percent in
2014 and rebalance as domestic consumption and investment moderate and a modest
recovery in trade partners’ growth boosts external demand. Inflation is projected to slow to
about 2 percent as the effects of the recent depreciation wear off. Unemployment is projected
to rise slightly through 2015.
12.
The medium and longer term present
new challenges because of the expected
slowdown in oil and gas investment. Steadily
increasing oil and gas investment over the last
decade culminated in a 17 percent growth rate
in 2013. This investment and the provision of
other goods and services to the oil and gas
sector has provided persistent stimulus to the
mainland economy. The increasing role of
mainland business in supplying oil and gas
sector has boosted growth and provided highlypaid jobs, but it has also pushed up unit labor
costs and undercut competitiveness elsewhere
in the mainland economy. With this investment
expected to flatten out in 2014-15 before
beginning a slow decline, new sources of
growth are needed. The staff’s central forecast is
a continuation of growth with only a modest
rise in unemployment in the next few years.
However, this is based on a scenario in which
the sources of growth shift smoothly away from
supplying the oil and gas sector to other parts
of the economy.

There are risks to this central scenario.
A sustained decline in oil and gas prices triggered by slower global growth or other
factors would have widespread effects. The fiscal rule would largely insulate the economy
from the direct effects of lower oil revenue. However, a decline in oil and gas prices would
undercut growth through a reduction in demand for mainland goods and services, and
through a reduction in private demand due to confidence and income effects.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

2013

NORWAY



A significant reduction in housing prices could be triggered by a reduction of oil prices
or other shocks to demand or confidence. While house prices have stabilized recently, it is
too early to declare an end to the housing boom or rule out a sustained price decline. A
large house price decline would likely reduce household consumption with adverse
consequences for retail trade, construction, and commercial real estate and lenders to
those sectors.



A more difficult transition to a growth model less dependent on supplying the oil and
gas sector could result in slower growth and higher unemployment during the shift. The
staff’s central scenario assumes that the transition will be relatively smooth, but
competitiveness challenges from high wage levels could inhibit the transition.

Authorities’ views
14.
The authorities generally agreed with the risk assessment. They noted that global
shocks would affect Norway mostly through the channel of oil and gas prices. They agreed
that housing prices and related household debt levels presented complex risks. They did not
forecast sustained declines in house prices and noted that both bank and households had
increased buffers through higher capital and saving respectively. They put considerable
emphasis on the risks stemming from the slowdown and eventual reversal of demand from the
oil and gas sector.

POLICY DISCUSSIONS: SUPPORTING THE
TRANSITION TO A NEW GROWTH MODEL
Norway’s medium-term prospects remain favorable, but the economy faces potential challenges
from the projected peak in oil-related activity in the mainland economy. Robust oil-related
growth in recent years has masked slowing productivity growth in the mainland economy and
the erosion of competitiveness. Estimates of output suggest that oil and gas production will pick
up over the medium term but start to decline around 2021. However, the decline in investment
and other demand from the oil and gas sector is expected to begin in 2015. Actions are needed
to ensure that the mainland economy serves as a robust source of growth when offshore activity
winds down.

A. Monetary Policy to Meet the Inflation Target
15.
The monetary policy rate has been held at 1.5 percent since March 2012. Recent
tensions among the considerations for setting the policy rate are abating. Inflation is now
roughly at its 2.5 percent target, lessening the argument for a rate cut to achieve the inflation
objective. At the same time, growth is slowing, unemployment is edging up, and house prices
have leveled off (Figure 7). These diminish the argument for a rate increase to offset
INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

15

NORWAY

overheating pressures. In this context, the staff views the Norges Bank’s monetary stance as
appropriate. Nevertheless, the policy rate will eventually have to normalize to a level somewhat
above the inflation target (Figure 8).
Authorities’ views
16.
The authorities agreed on the assessment of the policy stance, as it follows their
own assessment. They agreed that the policy rate would eventually need to normalize, but
noted that it would take several years under their current forecasts or market expectations.

B. Fiscal Policy to Stabilize the Economy and Save for the Future
17.
The 2014 revised budget entails an expansionary fiscal stance with a non-oil
structural deficit of 5.8 percent of mainland GDP. This is equivalent to 2.8 percent of the
GPFG assets rather than the 4 percent average real return on GPFG assets assumed for the
fiscal rule. However, the 2014 fiscal impulse is projected at 0.7 percent, adding stimulus in an
economy roughly at capacity.
18.
A neutral fiscal stance would be appropriate with still-low unemployment.
Because GPFG assets are growing more rapidly than the mainland economy, even keeping the
non-oil deficit at the current share of assets would imply a growing deficit relative to GDP and
a positive fiscal impulse. The government’s implementation of the fiscal rule in a manner that
keeps the non-oil deficit well below 4 percent of GPFG assets is appropriate, but an even
smaller transfer of GPFG resources to the budget to maintain a neutral fiscal stance would be
better so long as the economy remains near potential.
19.
The 2014 budget includes some minor tax reductions. These include: (i) a reduction
of the tax rate on personal income from 28 percent to 27 percent; (ii) a reduction of the tax
rate on net wealth by 0.1 percentage point to 1 percent; and (iii) elimination of the inheritance
tax. These changes reduce taxes by ¼ percent of GDP in 2014 on an accrual basis. Further
reforms are planned, and a tax commission is looking into options. Staff argued for a phasing
out of tax preferences for housing and eliminating other distortions in capital taxation, and
noted that more neutrality in the tax system could help to promote efficiency and support the
transition to a new growth model (see Section D).
Authorities’ views
20.
The authorities recognize the risk of excessive fiscal stimulus from spending too
large a fraction of GPFG assets, and this is reflected in their 2014 budget. However, they
placed greater emphasis on reducing the overall tax burden as a means of promoting
competitiveness. In their view, the most effective means of doing this is to simplify the tax
code and reduce overall rates, particularly on corporate income taxes, and improve the
efficiency of public expenditures without reducing services.

Q3, many savings banks still have some way to go to meet the LCR in its current form.

22.

Changes in risk weights for mortgages are also underway.



The government raised the minimum loss-given-default (LGD) risk model parameter from
10 percent to 20 percent in October 2013. The risk weights for residential mortgages
ranged from 10-15 percent before, and a minimum LGD requirement of 20 percent is
expected to increase the average risk weighting of residential mortgage loans to
about 20 percent.



The same capital requirements for mortgages are expected to apply to branches of Danish
and Swedish banks through agreements among the Nordic authorities, however the details
of how this will be done are still being worked out. This should result in these foreign
branches lending in line with the regulatory framework in Norway.



Staff supported tighter capital standards for mortgage lending for both domestic and
foreign banks and the efforts to harmonize prudential standards among Nordic countries.

23.
Nevertheless, vulnerabilities in the financial system remain. Stricter capital
requirements and tightening of loan-to-value (LTV) limits seem to have helped contain the
increase in house prices, but valuations are still high (Box 3). Banks continue to rely on
wholesale funding, and the deposit-to-loan ratio has not improved much. In this context,
tighter capital standards and LTV limits on mortgages should be maintained even if house
prices weaken further, and tighter limits on interest-only mortgage loans should be considered.

Box 2. Counter-cyclical Capital Buffers1
The Norges Bank is responsible under current regulations for providing advice to the
Government, on the use of the countercyclical capital buffer in consultation with the FSA. The
Ministry of Finance sets the level of the countercyclical capital buffer on a quarterly basis. The
buffer will be set at between 0 and 2.5 percent of banks’ risk-weighted assets.
The Norges Bank issued its first advice on the countercyclical capital buffer in December 2013.
Subsequently, the Ministry of Finance set the buffer at 1 percent in line with Norges Bank’s
recommendation. It will become effective from end-June 2015. The counter cyclical capital
buffer will eventually apply to all banks operating in Norway, but it will apply to branches of
foreign banks after 2016.
The Norges Bank formulates its advice mostly based on four indicators: (i) the ratio of total
credit to mainland GDP; (ii) the wholesale funding ratio of Norwegian credit institutions; (iii)
the ratio of house prices to household disposable income; and (iv) commercial property prices.
These indicators are compared with their historical trends, which are estimated with various
methods, and the difference between indicators and trends is used as a measure of financial
imbalances. These indicators gave a buffer guide of ¼ to 1¾ percent in mid-2013. The Norges
Bank’s final recommendation of 1 percent took into account other regulatory changes being
implemented at the same time, the fact that imbalances were no longer building up, and the
somehow slower growth in the Norwegian economy.
The current set of indicators is expected to be expanded over time as more experience is
gained. The Norges Bank’s advices will also take account of EU recommendations from the
European Systemic Rick Board.

income (LTI) ratios for mortgages. The FSA further lowered
the cap on the LTV ratio on mortgages to 85 percent in December 2011, along with other tightening
measures. Higher risk-weights on mortgage lending are also being implemented. In October 2013, the
Ministry of Finance raised the minimum loss-given-default (LGD) risk model parameter from 10 percent
to 20 percent. The risk weights for residential mortgages have on average ranged from 10–15 percent
before. A minimum LGD requirement of 20 percent is expected to increase the average risk weighting of
residential mortgage loans to about 20 percent. Additional requirements for IRB-models are also being
considered.

While it is difficult to disentangle the impact of prudential measures on house prices from
other factors, these measures may have helped to dampen house price growth. For example,

Authorities’ views
24.
The authorities generally agreed with staff’s assessment. New capital adequacy
regulation for banks adopted by the parliament in June 2013 contains a set of macroprudential
tools and powers, which are already in place to increase capital levels for Norwegian banks.
Nevertheless it is still important to follow up Norwegian banks’ capital adequacy, to ensure
that they are well prepared to meet downturns in the economy. The Nordic cooperation will
continue, including the efforts to improve comparability among Nordic banks and facilitate
transparency and market discipline.

D. Structural Reforms to Promote a New Growth Model
25.
Competitiveness concerns are becoming more pressing. Robust growth driven by
high offshore activity and large terms of trade gains has masked a decline in wage
competitiveness relative to peer countries. With demand from the offshore economy peaking,
the mainland economy has to shift to a growth model less dependent on supply the oil and
gas sector. Staff welcomed the authorities’ initiatives in this area, including setting up a
productivity commission to propose specific policies and starting a process to reassess the
extent of state ownership. These issues are explored in more detail in Chapters 2 and 3 of the
Selected Issues Paper.
26.

There are clear areas for competitiveness and productivity enhancing reforms.



Public services provided at the local level could be improved and made more
efficient. Small municipalities struggle to achieve economies of scale, and there is scope
to both improve services and save resources through consolidation guided by cost-benefit
and quality of service assessments.



Many public investment projects have social and economic benefits that are below
their costs, particularly in transportation. There is scope for greater efficiency by making
more use of cost-benefit analysis in the selection of the projects.



Agricultural policy is constraining productivity. Norway’s high trade restrictions and
subsidies are diverting private and public resources away from more productive sectors
and raising the cost of living, particularly for lower-income groups.



Greater differentiation in wage formation could facilitate the adjustment towards a
new growth model. Norway has a tradition of labor agreements that result in highly
similar wage growth rates across sectors and therefore a reliance on economy-wide wage
restraint to maintain competitiveness. However, wage formation may need to allow for
greater differentiation in compensation across sectors to better align wage developments
with productivity in the private sector, particularly if the transition costs in terms of lower
growth and higher unemployment turn our to be greater than anticipated.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

23

NORWAY

Competitiveness and efficiency could also be improved by relaxing the restrictions on
working hours and schedules.
27.
More neutrality in the tax system could also help to promote efficiency and
growth. A reduction in the extent to which the personal income tax system promotes housing
rather than productive investment would help redeploy new investment toward the exposed
industries that will need to replace oil and gas suppliers as an engine of growth. This could
include less preferential treatment for both residential and commercial real estate. More
generally, a simpler tax system with fewer exemptions and preferences (e.g., equalizing VAT
taxes on services and removing exemptions for high-value electric cars) could create fiscal
space for a reduction in overall tax rates, including the corporate income tax. Chapter 4 of the
Selected Issues Paper explores tax policy reforms for the mainland economy in greater detail.
28.
Further reform to pension and sickness and disability benefits would help labor
force participation. Private sector employment of persons over 62 has risen as a result of the
recent pension reform, but incentives for early retirement still remain in the public sector. Staff
urged the authorities to complete the pension reform by fully aligning the rules for public
sector pensions with the principles used in private sector pensions. Further reform to sickness
and disability benefits would likely improve the efficiency and competitiveness of the economy
and contribute to growth and employment.
Authorities’ views
29.
The authorities strongly agreed on the need for improvements to
competitiveness and productivity in the transition away from oil and gas supported
demand in the mainland economy. They noted that reforms in the corporate and personal
income tax system, support and protection for agriculture, and the provision of local public
services were under review. Some adjustments of labor market regulations were considered,
but authorities were more cautious on reductions to the tax preferences for housing.

STAFF APPRAISAL
30.
Norway’s near-term outlook remains stable with moderate growth and inflation
and low unemployment.
31.
Monetary policy is appropriate in terms of the authorities’ inflation targeting
framework. Tensions among the considerations for monetary policy have abated in the last
year. Specifically, the economy roughly at potential output, inflation at about the target, and
stabilizing house prices. However, the policy rate will eventually have to normalize to a level
somewhat above the inflation target. The exchange rate is broadly in line with fundamentals,
although high unit labor costs may become an obstacle to a shift toward a non-oil based
growth model.

24

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

NORWAY

32.
The government’s fiscal policy has been prudent, but it has entailed repeated
fiscal stimulus for an economy roughly at capacity. While the non-oil deficit has been
maintained well below 4 percent of GPFG assets, the rapid growth of the GPFG has still allowed
a rising non-oil deficit as a share of GDP. The recent policy of keeping the non-oil deficit well
below 4 percent of GPFG assets lessens overheating pressures, but a more neutral fiscal stance
would be appropriate so long as the economy remains near capacity.
33.
The stronger capital requirements for banks are welcome, in particular the higher
capital requirements for mortgage lending. These increased capital requirements are still in
their early stages, and they may need to be adapted in line with experience as implementation
proceeds to ensure that they are sufficient. The agreement among Nordic authorities on
aligning capital requirements for mortgage lending by branches as well as subsidiaries to
Norwegian conditions is commendable. These tighter capital standards and loan-to-value
limits on mortgages should be maintained in light of the vulnerabilities stemming from high
house prices and household debt even if the housing market softens further. However,
implementation challenges remain for this as well as in the broader process of integrating the
existing Nordic-Baltic agreements with the Banking Union and European institutions.
34.
The transition to a growth model less reliant on oil and gas-related demand
could be eased by structural reforms. A simpler income tax system and one that is less
skewed toward promoting housing rather than productive investment would help productivity
and remove disincentives toward investment in those parts of the productive economy that
will need to replace oil and gas as a source of growth. Aligning public sector pensions with
recent private sector reforms as well as reforms to sickness and disability pensions could
increase output through greater labor force participation. There is also scope for efficiency
gains in the better provision of public services, the improved use of cost-benefit analysis in the
selection of infrastructure projects, removing labor market rigidities, and lower protection and
subsidies in agriculture.
35.
It is proposed that the next Article IV consultation with Norway be held on the
standard 12-month cycle.

A large and prolonged reduction in oil prices would

indirectly through a possible reduction in demand

of immigrant inflows.

This could result in slower growth and higher
unemployment during the transition, particularly if
real wage adjustments do not facilitate labor
movements between sectors.

The Risk Assessment Matrix (RAM) shows events that could materially alter the baseline path (the scenario most likely to materialize in

the view of IMF staff). The relative likelihood of risks listed is the staff’s subjective assessment of the risks surrounding the baseline (“low”
is meant to indicate a probability below 10 percent, “medium” a probability between 10 and 30 percent, and “high” a probability of
30 percent or more). The RAM reflects staff views on the source of risks and overall level of concern as of the time of discussions with the
authorities. Non-mutually exclusive risks may interact and materialize jointly.

Authorities’ Response to Past IMF Policy Recommendations
Fund Policy Advice from 2013 Consultation
Macroprudential Policy: The Executive Board
supported:


increased capital requirements for
banks;



tighter macroprudential policies and
reduction of the relative tax
advantages of housing investments,
including tighter limits on
loan-to-value ratios and interest-only
mortgages; and



greater cross-border coordination on
macroprudential measures to ensure
that branches of foreign banks lend in
line with economic conditions in
Norway.

Authorities’ Actions
The authorities have made progress in
implementing the CRD IV/Basel III
requirements well ahead of the required
schedule. Tighter capital requirements are in
place, including counter-cyclical capital
buffers.
Higher capital standards for mortgage
lending expected to increase the average risk
weighting of residential mortgages loans to
about 20 percent. There have been no new
measures on loan-to-value ratios or interest
only mortgages, and tax preferences for real
estate are largely unchanged.
The Norwegian, Danish, and Swedish
authorities agreed that branches of Danish
and Swedish banks in Norway would apply
similar capital requirements on mortgages.

Fiscal Policy: The Board considered that wage
pressures and eroding competitiveness in the
non-oil sector argued for a slower rate of
spending in 2014 and beyond than 4 percent
of GPRG assets.

The 2013 fiscal outturn and 2014 budget are
well below 4 percent of GPFG assets (3.1 and
2.8 percent respectively). However, the fiscal
impulse was positive in 2013 outturn and it is
projected to be 0.7 percent of GDP in 2014.

Structural Reforms to Boost
Competitiveness: Directors agreed that
structural reforms are needed to enhance the
competitiveness of the mainland economy
through labor market, pensions, trade in
agriculture products, and public sector
services. Sickness and disability benefits could
be further reformed to improve efficiency and
help contain future pressures on government
spending.

No changes to sickness and disability benefits
in 2013, but some changes will be
implemented for disability benefits in 2015.
Other policies including state ownership,
efficiency of local public services, and
agricultural policy are under review, including
by the Productivity Commission.

Source: IMF staff.
1/ Public sector is defined as general government.
2/ Based on available data.
3/ Long-term bond spread over German bonds.
4/ Defined as interest payments divided by debt stock (excluding guarantees) at the end of previous year.
5/ Derived as [(r - π(1+g) - g + ae(1+r)]/(1+g+π+gπ)) times previous period debt ratio, with r = interest rate; π = growth rate of GDP deflator; g = real GDP growth rate;
a = share of foreign-currency denominated debt; and e = nominal exchange rate depreciation (measured by increase in local currency value of U.S. dollar).
6/ The real interest rate contribution is derived from the numerator in footnote 5 as r - π (1+g) and the real growth contribution as -g.
7/ The exchange rate contribution is derived from the numerator in footnote 5 as ae(1+r).
8/ Includes asset changes and interest revenues (if any). For projections, includes exchange rate changes during the projection period.
9/ Assumes that key variables (real GDP growth, real interest rate, and other identified debt-creating flows) remain at the level of the last projection year.

STATISTICAL ISSUES
Norway—STATISTICAL ISSUES APPENDIX
(As of June 6, 2014)
I. Assessment of Data Adequacy for Surveillance

General: Data provision is adequate for surveillance.
National Accounts: Breakdowns for oil-related parts of the mainland economy and other traditional
sectors would be useful, in light of growing needs to better understand the impact of oil and gas
activity on the mainland economy. Work is under way in this area, and the authorities are looking
into this issue.

II. Data Standards and Quality

Subscriber to the Fund’s Special Data Dissemination Standard (SDDS) since
1996. Uses SDDS flexibility options on the timeliness of the general
government operations and central government debt. SDSS metadata are
posted on the Dissemination Standard Bulletin Board (DSBB).

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2014 Article IV Consultation with Norway
On August 28, 2014 the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF)
concluded the Article IV consultation with Norway.1
The Norwegian economy slowed in 2013 with both mainland (i.e. non-oil) and offshore
growth below the 2012 pace. Mainland growth moderated to 2.1 percent in part due to weak
private consumption and mainland investment, while lower oil production kept offshore
growth down. The unemployment remains low, at around 3.5 percent, in spite of a growing
labor force due to immigration. House prices stabilized in mid-2013 although at high levels
and the housing market shows signs of cooling. Inflation rose to about the inflation target,
2.5 percent, partly due to last year’s exchange rate depreciation. The structural non-oil deficit
was 3.1 percent of Government Pension Fund Global (GPFG) assets and 5.1 percent of trend
mainland GDP. This is below the deficit permitted under the authorities’ fiscal policy rule,
but it still implies a positive fiscal impulse due to the strong growth in GPFG assets. The
overall current account surplus remains high at 14 percent of mainland GDP but declined in
2013 partly due to weaker petroleum exports.
Banks’ profitability has improved and capital ratios have strengthened. Banks continue to
rely on wholesale funding, mostly in the form of covered bonds, and many banks still have
some way to go before meeting the Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR) requirement. Norway’s
financial system is part of a tightly integrated Nordic-Baltic system. Inward links are mainly
from Swedish and Danish banks with a combined market share of a quarter to a third.
Outward links are relatively modest and concentrated in Nordic and Baltic countries and the
shipping industry.
The near-term outlook remains stable with moderate growth and inflation. However, the
medium and longer term present new challenges and uncertainties, particularly because of

Under Article IV of the IMF’s Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with members, usually every
year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial information, and discusses with officials the country’s
economic developments and policies. On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for
discussion by the Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the Board,
summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the country’s authorities. An explanation

expected slowdown in oil and gas investment. Steadily increasing oil and gas investment
over the last decade culminated in a 17 percent growth rate in 2013. With this investment
expected to flatten out in 2014-15 before beginning a slow decline, new sources of growth
are needed. Staff’s central forecast is a continuation of growth with only a modest rise in
unemployment in the next few years and inflation gradually rising back toward the target.
However, this is based on a scenario in which the sources of growth shift away from
supplying the oil and gas sector and toward other sectors of the economy or exports of oilrelated goods and services.
There are risks to this scenario. A substantial decline in oil and gas prices could undercut
growth through a reduction in demand for mainland goods and services, and through a
reduction in private demand due to confidence and income effects. A significant reduction in
housing process would likely reduce household consumption with adverse consequences for
retail trade, construction, and commercial real estate and lenders to those sectors. Also, a
more difficult transition to a growth model less dependent on supplying the oil and gas sector
could result in slower growth and higher unemployment during the shift.
Executive Board Assessment2
Executive Directors commended Norway’s continued steady economic growth, moderate
inflation, low unemployment, and large current account and fiscal surpluses. Nevertheless,
challenges remain. Directors agreed that policy priorities and structural reforms should be
geared towards preserving financial stability, supporting the transition to an economy less
dependent on oil and gas, and improving productivity and competitiveness.
Directors concurred that the current stance of monetary policy, under the authorities’
inflation-targeting framework, is appropriate. Given that the economy is roughly at its
potential, inflation is close to target, and house prices are stabilizing, the argument for a rate
increase has diminished for now. Directors noted that the policy rate might eventually have
to normalize to a level above the inflation target to meet the objectives of monetary policy,
and to mitigate risks of overheating, particularly, in the real estate market.
Directors welcomed the authorities’ prudent fiscal policy, in particular the decision to keep
the spending of oil revenues well below 4 percent specified under the fiscal rule. While
acknowledging the availability of resources for additional investments, most Directors saw
merit in a more neutral fiscal policy stance as long as the economy remains near capacity.
Directors welcomed the stronger capital requirements for banks ahead of the Basel III
deadlines, in particular the higher capital requirements for mortgage lending. Given that these

requirements are still in their early stages, they may need to be adapted as implementation
proceeds. Directors commended the agreement among Nordic authorities on aligning capital
requirements for mortgage lending by branches and subsidiaries to local economic
conditions. They agreed that tighter capital standards and loan-to-value limits on mortgages
should be maintained given the vulnerabilities stemming from high house prices and
household debt and banks’ reliance on wholesale funding, even if the housing market softens
further.
Directors emphasized the importance of further structural reforms to improve productivity
and competitiveness, and to promote the non-oil economy, and they looked forward to the
report of the Productivity Commission. Priorities include further reforms of the labor market,
pensions and public services, greater wage differentiation across sectors, and reducing
protection and subsidies in agriculture. Directors also recommended increased use of costbenefit analysis in the selection of infrastructure projects, and a simpler income tax system
with fewer incentives for promoting housing to encourage productive investment.

Statement by Audun Groenn, Executive Director for Norway
August 28, 2014
On behalf of my Norwegian authorities, I would like to thank staff for a very well-written
report on the Norwegian economy. My authorities broadly agree with staff's findings and
analysis in the report, and welcome the recommendations.
Economic Developments and Main Challenges
The analysis of current economic conditions and the forecasts in the staff report are broadly
in line with those of my authorities. The status of the Norwegian economy is favorable and
the prospects for a balanced development in the medium term are good. However, my
authorities recognize that the economy faces some challenges, and the outlook is subject to
some key risks. These risks are clearly stated in the risk matrix on page 26.
Since the year 2000, the Norwegian economy has experienced significant terms of trade
gains. The oil price has increased substantially, whereas prices on imports have been more
stable. The high oil price has spurred a rapid increase in oil and gas investments, providing
persistent demand stimulus to the Mainland economy. High income growth and low real
interest rates have supported growth in household demand.
In 2013, Mainland GDP growth slowed to a level below its historical average. Despite the
slowdown there are signs that the economy is operating close to full capacity. The
unemployment rate has been fairly stable at a level well below the average for the last
25 years. Moreover, almost all of the net employment growth over the past five years can be
accounted for by net immigration.
Looking ahead, the Norwegian economy faces some challenges. As pointed out in the staff
report, demand from the petroleum sector will commence on a downward trajectory in the
coming years. This implies that an important growth engine for the Norwegian economy will
lose its speed, and eventually be set in reverse. The latest investment survey indicates a
decline in petroleum investments already next year. Even if investment may increase
somewhat again over the next years, Norwegian businesses must adapt to the new situation in
order to maintain growth. High unit labor costs in Norway may make this transition even
harder, especially in a situation where productivity growth has slowed down compared with
historical trends.
Another challenge facing the Norwegian economy is the high house prices and the high debt
level among households. This makes some households vulnerable to shocks, and poses a risk
to financial stability. As pointed out by the staff report, a fall in the oil price or other shocks
to demand or confidence could lead to significant reduction in house prices, which would
amplify the negative impact on the Mainland economy. Solid banks and prudent lending
practices are crucial elements for maintaining financial stability.

2

Monetary policy
My authorities generally concur with staff’s assessment of monetary policy.
In the baseline outlook of Norges Bank’s June 2014 Monetary Policy Report, inflation is
expected to be somewhat below, but close to, 2.5 percent throughout the projection period to
2017. Capacity utilization may edge down in the coming year, but is expected to increase
towards a normal level at the end of the projection period. Both the objective of keeping
inflation close to target and the objective of sustaining capacity utilization in the years ahead
could, ceteris paribus, imply a somewhat lower key policy rate. A lower key policy rate today
may on the other hand increase the risk that financial imbalances build up again. Norges
Bank’s overall assessment in June was that the key policy rate should remain at today’s level
for a period ahead.
Fiscal policy
Norway’s fiscal framework, including the Government Pension Fund Global, is designed to
support a stable development of the economy in both the short and medium term. In addition,
it makes sure that the petroleum wealth also benefits future generations. The public revenues
from petroleum are large, volatile and temporary. A key feature of the framework is that it
delinks the earning of petroleum revenues from its use. This reduces the costs of future
structural changes and the risk of a sharp decline in industries exposed to international
competition.
On the earning side, Norway’s oil tax system and the state’s direct ownership in the oil
production are set up to capture the resource rents from the industry, to make sure they
benefit the entire Norwegian population. The government’s net cash flow from the petroleum
industry is transferred to the Government Pension Fund Global. This Fund is invested
abroad. This insulates the government budget from volatility in petroleum revenues, and
helps protect the krone against fluctuations in export income.
On the utilisation side, Norway has a fiscal rule for gradually phasing oil and gas income into
the fiscal budget. The fiscal rule was adopted in 2001 and received broad political support.
The design of the rule reflected that the issue was not whether more petroleum revenues
should be used in public budgets, but rather when and how quickly this should happen.
The fiscal rule specifies that the expected real return of the Fund, estimated at 4 percent, over
time shall be transferred to the central government’s budget. The rule is also intended to even
out economic fluctuations and support low unemployment. The spending of petroleum
revenues in a particular year must therefore be adjusted to the macroeconomic situation.
In a period with steep growth in the Fund’s capital, as is presently the case, to spend oil

3
revenues in line with the expected return on the Fund (the four-percent path) would have
provided the economy with a very strong boost in the short term. Therefore, spending of oil
revenues is at present held well below the four-percent path of expected return (with current
spending being at 2.8 percent of the Fund).
As long as the Fund’s capital increases relative to mainland GDP, the fiscal framework
implies an expansionary fiscal stance. Since the guidelines were introduced in 2001, the
structural non-oil budget deficit has increased from 1¾ to 5¾ percent of trend-GDP
Mainland Norway, or on average by 0.3 percentage points a year. While the fiscal impulse is
estimated to be above this average in 2014, this partly reflects that spending was lower than
anticipated in 2013. The Fund’s capital is expected to reach a peak at around 2 ½ times of
Mainland GDP sometime in the period 2020-2030. Once the peak has passed, the impulse
from fiscal policy to aggregate demand is expected to be negative.
The staff report suggests that a neutral fiscal stance would be preferable so long as the
economy remains near potential. How quickly petroleum revenue should be phased into the
economy is an important and legitimate question. In the view of my authorities, however, to
completely stop phasing in petroleum revenues in an economy performing near trend could
be seen as out of line with a framework that so far has served the country well and enjoyed
broad political support.
The government has emphasized the need to strengthen the growth capacity of the
Norwegian non-oil economy. This has bearings for the government’s budget priorities.
Lower taxes can improve competitiveness. Likewise, investments in infrastructure and
knowledge can support productivity. In the 2014 budget the government has started to
redirect the use of oil revenues along these lines.
A tax commission is currently reviewing the corporate tax system. Increasing taxes on
housing as a balancing measure to reduced corporate taxes is not a prioritized issue.
Financial sector issues
Norwegian banks have strengthened their solvency significantly in recent years, due to both
new capital requirements and demands from lenders and other financial markets participants.
Loan losses are low, but the banks must be prepared for the possibility of increased losses in
the next few years. Banks' financial position strengthened in 2013, but Norwegian banks
need to further bolster their equity capital position to tackle economic uncertainty and
forthcoming regulatory requirements.
My authorities generally concur with staff’s assessment of the risks and vulnerabilities
associated with households’ indebtedness, a possible house price reversal and financial
institutions’ reliance on wholesale funding. Uncertainty is a key feature in the international

4
economy, still being affected by financial imbalances. Banks must therefore continue to
strengthen their capital base, and assure more robust funding and improved liquidity.
A new capital adequacy regulation for banks adopted by the Norwegian parliament in June
2013 contains a set of macroprudential tools and powers. These are already in place to
increase capital levels in Norwegian banks. The counter-cyclical capital buffer, the buffer for
systemically important banks, and minimum floors for mortgage risk weights, are important
elements of the new capital adequacy regulation.
My authorities are pleased to note that staff recognizes one of the most important financial
sector policy issues for Norway. This is the need for tighter capital risk weights on mortgage
lending for both domestic and foreign banks, and the efforts to harmonize prudential
standards among Nordic countries through reciprocity. My Norwegian authorities believe
that different national circumstances may require different prudential policy responses, and
that a greater degree of host country regulation will contribute to securing financial stability
and leveling the playing field in national credit markets.
Structural policy
The Norwegian authorities welcome the emphasis on structural policy in the staff report.
Large terms of trade gains and rapidly increasing demand from offshore activities may have
masked the consequences of a decline in wage competitiveness relative to peer countries. As
demand from the petroleum sector will diminish at some stage, the Mainland economy needs
to shift to a growth model less dependent on the oil and gas sector. This calls for stronger
emphasis on structural policies and productivity growth.
In this context, the government has already introduced several structural policy measures.
The government has published a consultation paper on reforming the municipality structure
with the aim to increase the size of municipalities and make them more robust. Also, some
measures to increase efficiency in the agricultural sector are already taken. In order to reduce
costs and shorten the planning process in the construction sector, the government has
proposed changes in building and planning regulations. Furthermore, the government
recently published a consultation paper with proposals to soften labor market regulations on
working hours in order to increase labor market flexibility. In addition, a commission has
been appointed to explore how the regulations on working hours can be relaxed in order to
better mobilize labor resources without infringing upon important rights to health and
welfare. Measures to increase efficiency in road construction are also a main task for the
government.
As noted in the staff report, a Productivity Commission was appointed soon after the present
government took office. The Commission’s first report is to be presented in February 2015.
The government will consider all initiatives to increase productivity in the Norwegian
economy.

5

As mentioned above, a main strategy for the government to achieve a more growth-friendly
policy for Mainland businesses is to reduce taxes and to direct government spending towards
transport, research and development, and education. The bulk of future increases in spending
of oil revenues will therefore be on tax reductions, in combination with a broadening of the
tax base, and the mentioned expenditures items.
The Norwegian government wants to reduce taxes, especially taxes that hamper productivity
and economic growth. Several tax cuts have already been introduced in that regard, most
notably a cut in the personal and corporate income tax rate from 2014. My authorities concur
with the staff report that a simpler tax system would underpin productivity. Growthenhancing tax cuts in combination with simplifications and a broadening of the tax base will
be prioritized in the coming years. The relatively high corporate tax rate is an area of
particular concern.
In recent years, Norway has implemented comprehensive reforms of the old age pension in
the social security system, and of the early retirement scheme in the private sector. Benefits
can already be seen in the form of an increase in already high labor market participation rates
among elderly. However, as pointed out in the staff report, still there remains a need to
reform occupational pensions in the public sector, and more must be done to reduce the high
level of disability and sickness.
