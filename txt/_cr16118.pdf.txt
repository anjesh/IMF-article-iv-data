IMF Executive Board Concludes 2016 Article IV Consultation with Luxembourg
On May 6, 2016, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded the
Article IV consultation with Luxembourg.1
Luxembourg’s various competitive advantages of fiscal stability, a qualified workforce, prudent
financial oversight, and business friendly regulations, have delivered strong growth and an
expanding financial sector intermediating ever increasing flows. Economic growth reached
4.8 percent in 2015, well above the EU average, and was driven by net exports of financial
services also benefiting from the world’s major central banks’ quantitative easing. Growth is
projected at 3.5 percent this year, with continued strong job creation and subdued inflation.
In 2015, buoyant tax revenues due to higher-than-expected economic activity contributed to a
fiscal surplus of 1 percent of GDP. The tax reform proposal tabled in 2016 contains a significant
reduction in personal taxation and also in corporate income taxes starting in 2017. The measures
are expected to result in a broadly balanced fiscal position over the medium-term.
Growth prospects are subject to downside risks, including from weakening international activity.
Financial market stress could affect Luxembourg’s performance. Implementation of the
international tax transparency agenda, which Luxembourg has embraced, could weigh on
economic activity and tax revenue.

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with members, usually
every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial information, and discusses with officials
the country's economic developments and policies. On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which
forms the basis for discussion by the Executive Board.

Executive Board Assessment2
Executive Directors commended the authorities for their prudent policies and sound institutions,
which have underpinned the country’s continued strong macroeconomic performance. Directors
considered that growth prospects remain strong, although are subject to downside risks related
to clouded global prospects, potential market volatility, and changing international tax rules.
Against this backdrop, continued strong efforts are needed to tackle key challenges related to the
oversight of the financial system, adapt the tax regime to the changing international
environment, and implement structural reforms to diversify the economy and boost
competitiveness.
Directors encouraged the authorities to further strengthen oversight of the financial system and
to maximize the benefits from the Banking Union. They welcomed the authorities’ commitment
to continue to advocate for better oversight at the European level of nonbank holding companies
that include banks and aim to improve risk monitoring. Given rising global risks, Directors
stressed the importance of continued strong oversight of investment funds, and recommended
that linkages between investment funds and banks be closely analyzed and monitored, including
at the European level. Directors advised continued close monitoring of risks in the real estate
market. They also encouraged an increase in the capital of the central bank to bolster its
financial buffer.
Directors praised the authorities’ ongoing commitment to prudent fiscal policies. They endorsed
the targeting of a broadly balanced fiscal position and of low public debt over the medium term.
Directors recommended deeper pension reforms to ensure the long term viability of the system.
Directors welcomed the authorities’ proactive engagement with the European and global tax
transparency initiatives, and highlighted that the ongoing tax reform is an opportunity to
broaden the corporate tax base and close loopholes contributing to tax avoidance. Directors
considered that contingency measures should be put in place to address any revenue risks that

may arise from weakening international activity, implementation of the international tax
transparency agenda, and stress in financial markets.
Directors welcomed the authorities’ efforts to diversify and expand activity beyond the financial
sector to enhance the resilience of the economy. They concurred that additional measures are
needed to reduce inactivity traps, ensure wages’ alignment with productivity, and ease supply
side constraints in the real estate market.
Directors praised the authorities for their policies to cope with elevated refugee inflows, and
welcomed their integration strategy.

STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2016 ARTICLE IV CONSULTATION
April 20, 2016

KEY ISSUES
Growth prospects remain strong but are subject to downside risks. The financial
sector has been boosting Luxembourg’s economic growth well above the EU average by
intermediating ever increasing financial flows. However, clouded global prospects and
market volatility as well as changing international tax rules weigh on the economic
outlook.
Luxembourg needs to tackle specific prudential challenges, given the structure of
its financial system. The Banking Union is particularly beneficial to Luxembourg’s
banking system. The authorities should advocate at the European level to undertake
analysis and risk monitoring of linkages between banks and investment funds, which are
an important trait of Luxembourg’s financial system. While the EU framework of
investment fund regulation is solid, risk monitoring and supervision must continue to
evolve. Financial sector risks need to be monitored closely and, where necessary,
Luxembourg should advocate appropriate international regulation.
The authorities should carry on the prudent policies that made Luxembourg’s fiscal
position one of the strongest in the EU. While targeting a small fiscal surplus, they
should adapt the tax regime to the changing international environment and ensure the
long-term viability of the pension system.
Luxembourg is well equipped to cope with the refugee influx. Asylum seekers are
enrolled into language classes and other training programs. In addition, it would be
helpful to extend to them the programs designed for the long-term unemployed and
focus the ambitious economic diversification efforts on creating local lower-skill jobs.

Economic performance in 2015 once again surprised on the upside. Despite the
2 percent VAT hike that frontloaded private consumption to 2014 and—together with other fiscal
consolidation measures—depressed it in 2015, strong investments and net exports fuelled by
financial services propelled GDP growth to an estimated 4.8 percent. Meanwhile, the current account
surplus was steady at about 5½ percent of GDP in 2015, with a decline in merchanting activities
offset by an increase in the services balance. Strong economic performance and active labor market
policies have helped reduce the unemployment rate to 6½ percent by early 2016. After picking up in
the second half of 2015, headline inflation dipped again to near zero early this year, in line with euro
area trends.

The financial sector continues to expand. Luxembourg’s mostly outward oriented financial
system has developed into the leading private banking center in the eurozone, a central location of
banks providing intra-group liquidity management, and the second largest investment fund industry
in the world after the U.S.

are domestically owned and government ownership is significant in three of these. The banking

system has a very high average capital adequacy ratio (CAR) of nearly 20 percent and very
low non-performing loans. After peaking during the global financial crisis, total bank assets have
fluctuated around €770 billion, reflecting cross-border intra-group liquidity services provided by
Luxembourg’s banks. Since Luxembourg began sharing data on deposits in 2015, according to
the EU Savings Directive, small retail deposits from neighboring countries have been increasingly
replaced with larger inlays of high net worth individuals.
Funds industry. Since end-2008, about 20 percent (or €1.2 trillion) of all new net inflows into
investments funds worldwide came to Luxembourg funds. Benefiting from major central banks’
QE, assets under management (AUM) in the funds industry jumped 28 percent y/y to €3.6 trillion
in May 2015, but have stagnated since then amid global markets’ volatility. Reflecting a search
for yield, net inflows in funds reached €298 billion in 2015, which accounted for 72 percent of
the increase in AUM for the year. Income of local depository banks and of other providers of
ancillary services benefited from the rising AUM. In the year to September 2015, bank fee
income increased by 3 percent y/y while net interest margins stagnated. Tax receipts also
benefited directly and indirectly from the strong performance of funds.

Luxembourg’s fiscal position is among the strongest in the EU. The estimated fiscal
surplus of 1 percent of GDP in 2015 was the highest in the EU, and gross public debt of 21.6 percent
of GDP is the second-lowest. This compares favorably to the average debt-to-GDP ratio in other
financial centers (65–70 percent of GDP) and to countries with an AAA rating from at least
2 agencies (62 percent of GDP). Moreover, the public sector’s assets by far exceed its liabilities
resulting in a positive public net wealth of 43 percent of GDP at the end of 2015:Q3.
5.
Luxembourg’s provision of advance tax rulings to some multinational companies is
being challenged by the European Commission (EC). The EC has decided that the advance tax
ruling of Fiat involved improper state aid. The authorities disagreed with the EC decision and
appealed it in court. Meanwhile, the EC is investigating the much larger tax rulings of Amazon and
MacDonald’s (Appendix I).
6.
Luxembourg has supported the tax transparency agenda during its EU Presidency in
the second half of 2015. It participated in the OECD/G20 Base Erosion and Profit Shifting (BEPS)
project and committed to join the EU-wide automatic exchange of advance tax rulings effective
from 2017. Recognizing the progress, the OECD Global Forum on tax transparency removed
Luxembourg from its list of non-compliant countries in October.

The country is coping well with the refugee influx. From September 2015, asylum
applications have increased about threefold year-on-year. Building on past experience, the
authorities accommodate families with children who are considered easier to integrate over time. To
enroll refugees in schools, training programs, and language classes, the authorities called on retired
teachers to return to work.

OUTLOOK AND RISKS
8.
Growth is expected to remain solid over the medium term, underpinned by robust
domestic demand and net exports. GDP growth should ease to about 3½ percent in 2016 and to
its long-term trend of 3 percent thereafter. Strong contribution of net exports of services to growth
over the medium term reflects Luxembourg’s role as financial hub. Improving domestic sentiments
will sustain a rebound in private consumption from the low base of 2015. From 2017, domestic
demand should get a boost from planned personal income tax cuts. Despite solid growth and the
encouraging drop in the unemployment rate in 2015, skills mismatches, inactivity traps, and
refugees entering the labor market will likely keep unemployment at about 6 percent over the
medium term. With the expected resumption of wage indexation next year, inflation is projected to
pick up to 1.3 percent in 2017, and reach around 2 percent over the medium term.
Figure 5. Growth Projections and Domestic Sentiment
Domestic sentiment, while improving, remains below the

Luxembourg’s external position is projected to remain strong and broadly in line with
medium-term fundamentals. The current account surplus is expected to hover around 5 percent of
GDP over the medium term, supported by a large surplus in services partially offset by net income
payments and a negative balance on goods. The financial account will feature very large gross flows
due to Luxembourg’s position as a financial center. Given the projected current account surpluses,
Luxembourg’s positive net international investment position is expected to gradually increase over
the medium term. The External Balance Assessment (EBA-lite) approaches indicate that
Luxembourg’s external position is broadly consistent with its fundamentals. Its REER appears slightly
overvalued and the current account is relatively close to its norm (Appendix III).
10.
The medium-term outlook depends on Luxembourg’s adjustment to the tax
transparency challenges. EC probes into the advance tax rulings and other EU and international tax
transparency initiatives can undermine Luxembourg’s tax advantages and prompt transnational
companies to relocate. If these risks were to materialize, they could affect both the country’s growth
prospects and fiscal revenues. However, creating a taxation level playing field could ultimately
benefit Luxembourg by accentuating other competitive advantages, such as its AAA ratings from all
three major rating agencies, political stability, prudent fiscal stance, business friendly environment,
and qualified multilingual labor force.
11.
Financial market stress could affect Luxembourg’s performance. In case of severe
external shocks, unraveling financial exposures—including between banks and the funds industry—
could prompt dislocations in markets or institutions beyond the scope of the national authorities. A
re-assessment of the outlook or a re-evaluation of risks in global asset markets could lead to a sharp
adjustment of asset prices and a decompression of credit spreads adversely affecting Luxembourg’s
investment funds and banking system, which would be conduits of these spillovers across asset
classes and countries. The impact on the banking system could be mitigated if Luxembourg
becomes the recipient of safe havens inflows, but banks, funds management companies and
providers of ancillary services would likely experience a decline of taxable income. Despite the new
EU resolution framework, there remains a tail risk that banking sector difficulties would force the
national authorities to step in with a bail-out of domestic banks. However, these risks do not

outweigh the benefits of the ongoing capital markets integration and banking union in the EU,
which are crucial to Luxembourg’s success as a European financial hub.
12.
Other risks include weaker-than-expected growth in the euro area, Brexit, and another
surge of refugees. Luxembourg’s business model relies on continued integration within the
European Union, especially for its expanding financial sector, which is subject to uncertainty due to
the UK’s EU membership referendum. More generally, Luxembourg also remains vulnerable to
lower-than-expected growth in Europe. This highlights the need for Luxembourg to diversify its
services exports away from Europe and boost competitiveness, especially of non-financial sectors. In
addition, another surge in refugee arrivals could put strain on Luxembourg’s capacity to
accommodate and integrate them.
13.
Banks’ exposure to the real estate market is a risk to watch closely. Rising house prices
largely reflect strong demand outstripping supply, partly because of supply bottlenecks and zoning
regulations. For the handful of banks that lend domestically, mortgage loans amount to €23 billion
at end-October 2015, or about 45 percent of GDP. To discourage banks from providing risky loans,
in 2013 the Commission de Surveillance du Secteur Financier (CSSF) raised the capital provision
requirements from the regular 35 percent to 75 percent for new mortgage loans with a loan-tovalue ratio above 80 percent. Since 2008, household debt has risen by 10 percent of GDP, but
remains moderate at 59 percent of GDP.
14.
The authorities projected higher economic growth than staff and viewed risks to the
outlook as broadly balanced over the medium term. They concurred that growth would converge
to its trend rate of about 3 percent over the long run, but projected that the expanding financial sector
and stronger EU activity would sustain it at around 4 percent in 2016–19. Also, the authorities agreed
with staff that Luxembourg’s external position is broadly in line with fundamentals. They believed that
their proactive implementation of the tax transparency measures—including those spearheaded by
Luxembourg during its EU presidency in the second half of 2015—would mitigate the potential
downside risks as more and more jurisdictions worldwide are joining the efforts to level the
international taxation playing field. Moreover, the pressures to align taxes with economic activity
would motivate some companies to increase their presence in the country, while the elimination of
aggressive tax regimes in all countries would accentuate Luxembourg’s many other competitive
advantages, such as its triple-AAA rating. While the integration of financial sector oversight in the
Banking Union is strengthening the resilience of the banking system, the authorities considered that
the existing risk management framework, as well as the diversified investor base and asset
composition of investment funds would help buffer the impact of financial market volatility on
Luxembourg.

POLICY DISCUSSIONS
A. Financial Sector Policies
15.
The European Banking Union and EU financial regulations frameworks are particularly
positive for Luxembourg. Given the dominant presence of foreign banks with cross-border
activities, the Single Supervisory Mechanism (SSM) is an improvement in supervision, reducing
home-host hurdles for cross-border banks, and can establish a consistently high level of oversight.
The authorities should take advantage of the SSM to advocate for better oversight at the European
level of nonbank holding companies that include banks and should take pro-active steps to improve
risk monitoring. The Single Resolution Mechanism (SRM) can ensure swift intervention ahead of
insolvency, with pooled financial support from the industry in the Single Resolution Fund (SRF). The
European Deposit Insurance Scheme recently proposed by the European Commission would
complete the Banking Union. Luxembourg’s investment fund industry enjoys EU passports under the
regulatory norms in the Undertakings for the Collective Investment in Transferable Securities (UCITS)
Directives and the Alternative Investment Fund Managers (AIFM) Directive; these allow offering
investment funds across EU countries while supervision is in the competency of the CSSF. The
significant enlargement of the resources of the CSSF in recent years is welcome and its capacity
should be commensurate with the increasing size and complexity of the financial sector.
16.
Ensuring steady deepening of interagency collaboration in the context of the SSM and
of the SRM is key. As 72 percent of bank assets in Luxembourg fall under the supervision of the
ECB, the timely flow of information on micro-prudential risks, where the CSSF has primary access to
supervisory information, is a critical element of the system. The CSSF participates in on- and off-site
supervision of Significant Institutions as part of the joint supervisory teams (JSTs) and contributes to
the development of ECB supervisory policies. JSTs also advise on waivers to the large exposure limit
and national Liquidity Coverage Ratios (LCR). Such waivers should be granted only under strict
criteria and deep analysis. The CSSF also contributes to the development of the ECB supervisory
approach to be applied by National Competent Authorities (NCAs) in the context of Less Significant
Institutions (LSIs). Regarding the SRM, the CSSF together with the Single Resolution Board initiated
in 2015 the drafting of transitional resolution plans in relation to a first batch of priority institutions.
The CSSF also transferred in January 2016 the ex-ante contributions collected in 2015 to the newly
established SRF. For eight years, banks will be making contributions to the SRF reaching in total at
least 1 percent of covered deposits.
17.
Luxembourg is implementing EU banking union directives recently transposed in
national laws. The law transposing the Fourth Capital Requirements Directive (CRDIV) was adopted
in July 2015. Luxembourg’s banking supervisor has raised capital buffers for systemically important
banks by an extra 0.5–1 percent by January 2019 and introduced countercyclical capital buffers,
initially with zero values. The new liquidity ratio of Basel III has forced some banks to use BCL’s
deposit facility to meet the LCR. To comply with LCR requirements, banks that upstream liquidity to
their parent will have to develop rigorous liquidity management infrastructures. The law transposing

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

11

LUXEMBOURG

the Bank Recovery and Resolution Directive (BRRD) and the Deposit Guarantee Schemes Directive
(DGSD) passed Parliament in December 2015, completing the implementation of the Single Rule
Book in Luxembourg.
18.
The high interconnections of Luxembourg’s financial system with the rest of the world
make it a recipient and conduit of global financial volatility (Selected Issues Paper, Chapter 1):
Investment funds may propagate shocks across assets when rebalancing portfolios. They enjoy a
diversified investor base (75 percent from Europe), and have global exposures to debt securities
and equity across many advanced and emerging countries with the euro area accounting for
35 percent of these exposures, the U.S. 26 percent, and emerging markets 13 percent. They are
linked to banks in Luxembourg, which have cross-border and foreign currency interbank claims
accounting for 54 percent of total banking assets at mid-2015; 60 percent of these claims are
intra-group claims.1

Volatility in financial markets would affect the
domestic economy through investment funds.
Volatility of real GDP growth is highly correlated
with the volatility of investment fund assets’
growth, which in turn fluctuates with global
market developments. Fiscal revenues from the
financial sector—overall accounting for about 8
percent of GDP in 2014—would also be affected
by market fluctuations.2

Globally, the investment fund industry is subject to increasing risks:



Credit risk. As a result of a search for yields, exposures have shifted to more risky and less liquid
assets. Exposure of Luxembourg funds to corporate bonds had risen from €141 billion
(or 29 percent of total bond investments) at the

leverage increases sensitivity to market movements, such as those resulting from interest rate
shifts.


Redemption risk. High asset valuations, the large cash pools of corporations invested in recent
years, and first-mover advantages increase the likelihood of sudden runs on investment funds.
Experience from the global financial crisis and of the 2011–12 euro area crisis shows that gross
and net redemptions can be large.



Liquidity risk. Some funds may be less liquid than redemption terms and conditions, further
exacerbating susceptibility to runs. To protect fund value, asset managers could first sell risky
assets, potentially aggravating the market impact especially in less liquid markets. Cash holdings
would initially increase in the portfolio of investment funds for precautionary reasons, but would
decline if redemptions are sustained over time. Investors could also reallocate from more risky
to less risky investment funds.



As asset prices increasingly move in unison, benefits of diversification dwindle. If a shock becomes
severe, fire sales affecting one market or asset class could spread to other countries or assets.3 In
such circumstances, global factors can drive the returns of diverse funds, and common
responses of asset managers across countries and asset classes can offset the benefits of
portfolio diversification.

20.
Shocks can be transmitted from the investment fund industry to banks (Box 1). While
investors bear the risks of investment funds, shocks affecting the investment fund industry could be
transmitted to the banking system through various links, and impact Luxembourg as activity in the
financial sector declines. On the other hand, the banking system, where contingent liabilities of the
vast majority of (foreign-owned) banks would be the responsibility of their home country, might
also benefit from safe haven flows.

holdings of bank bonds, stocks, derivatives, and deposits. Investment funds’ liabilities to banks in
Luxembourg and banks abroad are also large, amounting to €175 billion in 2015:Q3.
Box 1. Linkages between Investment Funds and Banks
Securities and derivatives. Investment funds hold significant claims on banks in the form of bonds,
equities, loans and derivative contracts, valued at €601 billion, and have €175 billion of liabilities to banks in
the form of derivatives, loans and short sales in 2015:Q3, including €133 billion of derivative contracts.
Cash balances. Investment funds hold large
bank deposits, estimated at €220 billion in
2015:Q3, about half of which are
concentrated in Luxembourg’s depository
banks, totaling 50 percent of their liabilities.
Deposits of investment funds can be volatile,
with a standard deviation of monthly net

accounting services which are often priced in proportion to total fund assets, and sometimes share common
clients with asset managers. Banks, as well as insurance companies, also serve as counterparties for securities
lending by investment funds and various types of derivative contracts held by investment funds.

insurance companies would create further scope for contagion.
Reputational risks. In case of a deep crisis in one market, contagion can spread to other segments of the
financial system and, potentially, affect Luxembourg’s established trademark as a financial center.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND



Other linkages. Banks, in particular depository banks, derive income from providing various and
substantial services to investment funds, are counterparties for securities lending, and
sometimes have common clients with asset managers. In addition, there are significant
ownership links between Luxembourg fund management companies and large banking groups
or insurance companies, creating further scope for contagion during periods of severe market
volatility, including through reputational effects or implicit guarantees.

21.
Oversight of investment funds and asset managers should remain strong and continue
to evolve.4 Risk monitoring and the frameworks for risk management and supervision of investment
funds are laid out in the UCITS directives III and IV, covering 80 percent of the funds in Luxembourg,
and in the AIFM Directive covering other funds. The data reporting allows the CSSF to obtain precise
information on individual investment funds, and the CSSF has oversight over the liquidity stress tests
that the asset managers have to perform. Adequate resources should be allocated to the oversight
to ensure that sound risk management practices, prudential norms or rules governing liquidity,
leverage, redemptions and asset valuation are in place at the fund and at the asset manager levels.
Some areas require specific attention:


Data monitoring should allow detecting early warning signs of realization of market risk, credit
risk or liquidity risk and possible shocks through redemptions.



Data monitoring should allow identifying funds’ sensitivity to interest rates and credit market
movements. The use of derivatives that could boost yields and leverage, securities lending, and
liquidity mismatches between assets and redemption terms should be more specifically
scrutinized, especially given the increased use of derivative leverage by several of Luxembourg’s
bond funds in recent years.



The CSSF should evaluate investment funds’ resilience under various stress test scenarios. Risks
should be assessed not only at the investment fund level but also from a financial stability
perspective, allowing for correlated shocks across funds and for significant large portfolio
reallocations between funds and net redemptions.



The toolkit of liquidity risk management of investment funds by asset managers and regulators—
comprising redemption fees, gates, side pockets and suspension of redemptions—should be
tested to severe stress scenarios and continue to evolve with international best practice.

22.
Risk monitoring and policy frameworks should take into account linkages between
banks and investment funds:


Joint scenario analysis between banks and investment funds including liquidity stress tests
should be undertaken. The large fund exposures to corporate bonds could turn illiquid and
cause sharp movements in fund value, which, joined with redemptions and shocks to other asset
classes, could have indirect effects on banks’ income. Changes in direct exposures to banks
could affect banks’ liquidity position and funding.

4

Chapter 3 of the April 2015 Global Financial Stability Report concluded that oversight of the asset management
industry should be strengthened at the global level.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

15

LUXEMBOURG



As redemptions could affect banks in Luxembourg and abroad, the authorities should advocate
further financial stability analysis of these linkages in the SSM, and include them in the design of
joint fund-bank stress test scenarios, including asset managers who are owned by systemic banks.



To mitigate the impact of potential shocks, banks should be compliant with the local LCR with
good collateral, while the Eurosystem should stand ready to provide liquidity to banks if a shock
materializes.

23.
The Comité de Risque Systémique (CRS) should play an important role in the
macroprudential oversight of Luxembourg’s financial system. The committee, bringing together
the Ministry of Finance, the BCL, the CSSF, and the Commissariat aux Assurances, has added the
analysis of linkages between investment funds and banks to its work program at the national level,
but it should also ensure that the linkages are examined at the European Systemic Risk Board (ESRB),
and, if needed, that corrective actions are recommended. On the housing market and in light of ever
rising housing prices, the authorities should explore the effectiveness of recent measures in
containing risk and whether further macro-prudential measures such as limits to loan-to-value ratios
in addition to those already taken in 2013 would be appropriate.

The authorities should increase the capital of the Banque Centrale du Luxembourg
(BCL). Adding capital now should anticipate that capital may fall when monetary policy is
normalized, and ensure that BCL operational expenses are well covered (Box 2). Even if
redenomination risks of Target 2 claims have receded in recent years, the comprehensive net worth
of the central bank is important from a risk management perspective. An agreement between the
government and the BCL should be reached and implemented swiftly.

The BCL would benefit from a one-off
capital increase. The low level of capital of
the BCL means that it currently operates with
little financial buffers to cover its net present
value of operating expenses. Such buffers
could dwindle were the BCL to experience
losses or lower returns going forward.

Risks to the BCL balance sheet appear

entities is limited. Its creditor position in the

Target 2 balance of the Eurosystem (reflected
in liabilities of €57 billion to depository institutions) means that it might experience losses only if tail risks
such as redenomination risks materialize. As a net borrower from euro area depository institutions, some
remuneration risks could materialize going forward when monetary policy is normalized. Market risk and
currency risk would arise mainly from the large exposures vis-à-vis non-euro area residents and are affected
by the global evolution of asset prices and returns.
4

The financial strength of the BCL matters for the functioning of the Eurosystem. Given that the
monetary policy stance is decided by the Governing Council of the ECB, the voice of euro area national
central banks is best heard if political interference can be avoided by ensuring their financial strength.
Moreover, national central banks’ capital also matters because, as owners of the ECB, they should stand
ready to recapitalize the ECB would a need arise.

Progress has been made in implementing the 2012 AML/CFT standard and further
critical work is underway. As a result of legislation passed in 2014–15, all acts of terrorist financing
covered by the 2012 standard are criminalized, bearer shares must be immobilized, and authorized
operators acting in the Luxembourg Freeport are subject to AML/CFT measures. Work is currently
underway to implement the revised FATF standard and the 4th AML/CFT EU Directive, including
listing tax crimes amongst the predicate offenses to the money laundering offense, and facilitating
timely access to information on beneficial owners of legal persons and arrangements. The
authorities are encouraged to pursue these efforts—which are critical in light of ongoing
international initiatives to curb tax evasion and the misuse of corporate structures—on a timely
basis, and to ensure that the intensity of AML/CFT supervision of the financial sector remains
commensurate with the level of money laundering and terrorist financing risks.

review the financial system in greater depth. As a systemic jurisdiction, Luxembourg is subject to
mandatory FSAs. For the FSA to be completed on time, the Financial Sector Stability Assessment
(FSSA) report must be discussed in the Board with the 2017 Article IV consultation. Staff encouraged
the authorities to consider further analysis of bank-fund linkages as part of the FSA.
27.
The authorities considered the Banking Union strongly positive for the euro area as a
whole and for Luxembourg. They noted that the attractiveness of the euro area financial system as a
whole will be improved once the fully fledged banking union is achieved. The authorities argued in
favor of achieving the last pillar of the Banking Union, the common European deposit insurance
scheme, to complete the Union backstop. Being a full member of the SSM (and of the other pillars of
the Banking Union) generates strong benefits to Luxembourg and also facilitates home-host
discussions, including for non-EU cross-border banks. The authorities noted that waivers granted to
large exposure limits or the LCR would follow strict supervisory rules and assessment by the JSTs with
decisions taken at the SSM Supervisory Board. Regarding oversight of nonbank holding companies of
banks, measures are taken to monitor ownership links at the time of authorization.
28.
The authorities agreed that linkages between investment funds and banks warrant
further analysis. They considered that bank-fund linkages require further analysis from a macroprudential perspective and should be included in the design of joint fund-bank stress test scenarios. The
CRS has added the analysis of these linkages to its work program. Investment strategies of investment
funds are well advertized in their prospectus and management companies must perform mandatory
liquidity risk management and stress tests which are reviewed by the CSSF. The authorities argued that
the existing EU Directives provide a solid framework for risk monitoring, risk management and
supervision of Luxembourg’s investment funds. They are also actively participating in international
discussions in this area and they are well informed about international developments. They consider
themselves well positioned to implement resulting recommendations and to integrate improvements in
their regulatory practices. In that respect, they welcomed the UCITS V and AIFM Directives which have
clarified and strengthened the role and responsibilities of depository banks. They felt that the
diversification strategies of the large number of investment funds provide a buffer to the impact of market
volatility on Luxembourg’s financial system, thus mitigating downside risks to the economy. They agreed
that the housing market merits continued monitoring, as continued price rises may not be sustainable.

B. Fiscal Policy
29.
The medium-term revenue risks related to the international tax transparency agenda
and financial sector volatility, and the long-term pension challenges make it appropriate for
Luxembourg to run a small fiscal surplus and aim to set the public debt ratio on a slightly
downward path. The structural fiscal surplus of around ½ percent of GDP over the medium term
could be achieved by fully implementing previously announced consolidation measures in the
Zukunftspak while limiting the size of the announced tax reduction package. In combination with a
gradual pension reform, this should rebalance public finances to eliminate central government
deficits, set the public debt–to-GDP ratio on a slightly declining path, and ensure long-term viability
of the pension scheme.

After better than expected performance in 2015, Luxembourg’s fiscal position is
projected to remain strong in 2016, with the fiscal surplus remaining at about 1 percent of
GDP. Changing EU rules on allocating VAT from e-commerce subtracted about 1.2 percent of GDP
from fiscal revenues in 2015. Moreover, one-offs including a public sector wage hike, costs of the
EU presidency, public infrastructure investment, and accommodating refugees added around
0.2 percent of GDP to public spending. On the positive side, rising AUMs in Luxembourg-based
funds boosted subscription tax intake by up to 0.2 percent of GDP. The fiscal adjustment package

According to the EC, Luxembourg is one of only five EU countries fully compliant with the Stability
and Growth Pact (SGP).
31.
The ongoing tax policy review presents an opportunity to address fiscal revenue risks
from the EU and international tax transparency initiatives and volatile financial flows. EC state
aide probes, enhanced transparency for tax rulings, international agreements on tax information
exchanges, and OECD/G20 anti-Base Erosion and Profit Shifting (BEPS) recommendations should in
time help to create a more level international corporate taxation playing field and reduce the
national scope to grant favorable tax treatment to selected companies. This can diminish their
incentives to conduct business through Luxembourg and affect corporate income taxes which yield
as much as 5 percent of GDP. Furthermore, shifts in investment portfolio allocations can put at risk
the subscription tax yielding 1½ percent of GDP and other fiscal revenues generated by the funds
industry. Moreover, falling oil and gas prices diminish incentives for cross-border retail fuel sales,
undercutting fuel excise and VAT revenues yielding about 2 percent of GDP. In this context, the tax
reform should aim at widening the corporate tax base while eliminating special tax regimes and
lowering statutory tax rates. The decision to phase out the IP Box tax regime from mid-2016 is a step
in this direction. The government should also develop contingency measures, including revisiting
the low real estate taxes, in case negative revenue risks materialize.
32.
Tax reform proposals unveiled at end-February contain a significant reduction in
personal taxation and also in the corporate income tax rate from 2017. In addition to allowing
expiration of the temporary surcharge on personal income, the government proposed to rebalance
the income tax brackets to reduce the tax burden on all but the wealthiest households; allow
families to file their taxes jointly or separately; realign parental tax benefits; and increase home
ownership incentives. Corporations would benefit from reduction in the statutory profit tax rate
by 3 percentage points to about 26 percent by 2018. These measures would reduce total fiscal
revenue by up to 1 percent of GDP, fully using up the projected fiscal surpluses over the medium
term. While some of the tax measures aim to increase housing supply, the envisaged tax relief for
home buyers would aggravate existing imbalances given that demand for real estate structurally
outstrips supply.
33.
While acknowledging that the proposed tax cuts are broadly affordable, staff
emphasized the need to use the available fiscal space for growth-enhancing measures. Staff
argued for limiting the tax cuts to less than ½ percent of GDP, broadening the tax base, and using
part of the fiscal surplus for public investments in infrastructure. However, staff recognized that the
medium-term fiscal position would remain broadly appropriate under the proposed tax cuts. Under
the baseline, Luxembourg’s public debt would stay well below the authorities’ ceiling of 30 percent
of GDP over the medium term and remain sustainable under plausible scenarios, including a sizeable
contingent liability shock stemming from the banking sector (Tables 7–8).

34.
Continued reform of the pension system is necessary to ensure its viability over the
long run (Box 3). While the pension system is currently generating surpluses, population ageing is
expected to put significant pressure on pension expenditures. Despite factoring in continued strong
migrants inflows and a doubling of Luxembourg’s population by 2060, the 2015 EU Ageing Report
projected an increase of pension expenditures of about 4 percent of GDP between 2013 and 2060.
Under a less optimistic assumption for migrant inflows, the 2012 Ageing Report projected an
increase in pension expenditures of about 9 percent of GDP by 2060. Accordingly, the upcoming
2016 pension review should propose additional parametric reforms of the pension system to
increase the effective retirement age, now the lowest among the neighboring countries.
35.
The authorities reaffirmed their commitment to sound fiscal policies and stressed that
the announced tax reductions are commensurate with the fiscal position’s strength. They noted
that significant fiscal surpluses in 2014–15 emerging from upward revision of the initial prudent
estimates and another large surplus projected for 2016 have stoked pressures to cut taxes. The
authorities also noted limited public support for further reform of the pension system that is running
current surpluses and has accumulated reserve assets of about 30 percent of GDP. Steady economic
growth and migrant inflows have led to an upward revision of the potential GDP growth rate as well
as an improved outlook for long-term pension and age-related spending. Recognizing these
developments, the EC proposed to lower its MTO for Luxembourg from 0.5 percent of GDP structural
fiscal surplus to 0.5 percent of GDP deficit. The authorities project that Luxembourg fiscal position will
remain in small surplus even after the tax cuts, which is well above the new MTO.
36.
The authorities acknowledged that implementing EU and OECD tax transparency
requirements could lead to some fiscal losses upfront but benefit the country in the long run.
They pointed out that the losses from changing EU rules on allocating VAT from e-commerce proved
less than initially estimated as several large companies preferred to stay in Luxembourg, and some
even expanded their operations. In the same vein, the authorities considered that the OECD and EU
initiatives countering tax base shifting and, in time, creating a more level international taxation
playing field, would motivate some companies to increase their economic presence in Luxembourg,
which could offset the immediate fiscal losses from enhanced tax transparency. Meanwhile, the
authorities have reaffirmed their disagreement with the EC decision that the advance tax ruling
provided to FIAT involved improper state aid. They appealed this decision in court and expect the court
hearings to take a few years.

Box 3. Pension Reform in Luxembourg
Luxembourg’s pay-as-you-go pension system is generous and currently generating surpluses. Its
effective retirement age is low while its replacement rate (average pension benefit as a share of average
wage at retirement) is amongst the highest in Europe. However, Luxembourg’s public pension expenditures
are lower than pension contributions owing to the current advantageous demographics.
However, pension expenditures are expected to increase significantly over time. The EC in its
2012 Ageing Report projected an increase in pension expenditures from 9.2 percent of GDP in 2010 to
18.6 percent of GDP by 2060, owing to adverse demographics due to population ageing. The recent
2015 Ageing Report forecasts a more benign increase in pension expenditures (from 9.4 percent of GDP in
2013 to 13.4 percent of GDP in 2060), mainly due to more robust population growth, via net migration. This
appears more optimistic than the recent population projection produced by the United Nations.
Continued reform of the pension system is advisable. The very strong population growth projection,
through long-term net migration, should be treated with caution. Additional pension reform should thus be
considered, including through increasing the effective retirement age and lowering benefits, to improve the
sustainability of the system and fairness across generations. As such, additional measures would strengthen
the pension reform introduced in 2012, which included (i) a slow and gradual decline in the replacement
rate; (ii) automatic decline in indexation, benefits and increase in contributions in the event that future
expenditures exceed contributions; and (iii) incentives to postpone retirement. 1, 2

C. Structural Reforms for Growth and Employment
37.
The government is taking steps to
diversify the economy. Expanding activity
beyond the financial sector is important to
enhance the resilience of the economy and
create jobs for low-skilled workers. To diversify
the economy, the authorities promote
development in a few priority sectors, including
automotive components, eco-innovation,
healthcare and biotechnologies, information
and communication, materials and production,
and space technologies. The authorities
champion Luxembourg’s role as a logistical
transit hub in the EU, have engaged in the panEuropean project to build a supercomputer, and
announced ambitious plans to create a legal
framework for investing in mining asteroids.
These should be complemented with structural
reforms to address supply-side constraints, such
as easing zoning requirements for real estate
construction or removing restrictions for
weekend and after hours work.

unemployment further over the medium term would require deeper reforms to address skill
mismatches, upgrade education outcomes, improve the quality of vocational training and enhance
the apprenticeship system. To reduce inactivity traps, the authorities could explore options to
refocus generous unemployment and social benefits so as to promote active job search and
acceptance of available vacancies, while ensuring that real wages remain in line with productivity.
39.
Luxembourg is well-equipped to cope with elevated refugee inflows (Selected Issues
Paper, Chapter 2). The government has allocated sufficient budget financing to refugee
accommodation programs. For faster integration of refugees in the labor market, the authorities
could consider issuing them temporary employment permits while their asylum application is
considered. In addition, it would be helpful to extend to refugees who have been granted asylum
the employment promotion programs currently available for the long-term unemployed.
40.
The authorities stressed the proactive measures being taken to diversify the economy.
Among other initiatives, laying the foundations for future innovations and growth, Luxembourg is set
to become the first nation in the world that set up a legal framework for mining asteroids.
41.
The authorities underscored the success of their policies for tackling long-term
unemployment and facilitating integration of refugees. ADEM’s personalized programs tailored to
the needs of unemployed and labor demand as well as efforts to re-classify out of the labor force
persons with work restrictions related to medical conditions have helped reduce the unemployment
rate. Luxembourg’s past experience in accommodating refugee waves, such as the one resulting from
the Bosnian war in the early 1990s, have informed current policies emphasizing language training and
welcoming families with children who are considered easier to assimilate over time.

STAFF APPRAISAL
42.
Luxembourg’s growth prospects remain strong but are subject to increasing downside
risks from weakening international activity and stress in financial markets. The financial sector,
intermediating ever increasing financial flows, propped Luxembourg’s economic growth well above
the EU average. Various competitive advantages, such as Luxembourg’s triple-AAA rating and its
qualified labor force, would continue to benefit the country. However, implementation of the
international tax transparency agenda, which Luxembourg has embraced, could weigh on economic
activity and tax revenue. Financial volatility triggered by a reassessment of underlying risks in global
markets could lead to an adjustment of asset prices and financial flows, adversely affecting
Luxembourg’s financial system. Other risks include weaker-than-expected growth in the euro area,
Brexit, and another surge of refugees.
43.
The Banking Union, underpinned by strong collaboration and adequate supervisory
resources, is particularly beneficial for Luxembourg. The SSM should be able to improve
supervision, especially of cross-border banks, and can establish a consistent and high level of
oversight. The significant enlargement of the resources of the CSSF in recent years is welcome and
they should be commensurate with the increasing size and complexity of the financial sector.

24

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

LUXEMBOURG

Likewise, the SRM can ensure swift intervention ahead of insolvency, with financial support from the
industry pooled in the SRF. The recent transposition of the Deposit Guarantee Scheme Directive and
of the Bank Recovery and Resolution Directive completes the legal implementation of the Single
Rule Book in Luxembourg. The authorities should also advocate for better oversight at the European
level of nonbank holding companies that include banks and should take pro-active steps to improve
risk monitoring.
44.
Continued strong oversight of investment funds and their management companies is
necessary. The use of derivatives that boost leverage, liquidity mismatches between assets and
redemption terms, and the use of securities lending to improve cash returns should be more
specifically scrutinized. In line with evolving international best practice, data monitoring should allow
identifying funds’ sensitivity to interest rates and credit market movements.
45.
Risk monitoring and regulatory frameworks should take into account the linkages
between banks and investment funds. These linkages, which work through direct exposures,
services provided by banks, and ownership are an important trait of Luxembourg financial system
and could have stability implications in instances of severe financial market volatility, making
Luxembourg a recipient and a conduit of shocks. Luxembourg should propose to discuss these
linkages at the European level and include them in the design of joint fund-bank stress test
scenarios. Risks should be assessed not only at the investment fund level but also from a broader
financial stability perspective.
46.
Risks in the real estate market should continue to be closely monitored. Steadily rising
house prices appear to mainly reflect supply bottlenecks against a growing demand. The authorities
should explore the effectiveness of recent macro-prudential measures in containing risks and
whether further measures such as limits to loan-to-value ratios are appropriate.
47.
The revenue risks of the international tax transparency initiatives and volatile financial
flows make it appropriate for Luxembourg to run a small fiscal surplus and low public debt.
Luxembourg needs to maintain sufficient buffers in case of need. This justifies targeting a small fiscal
surplus of around ½ percent of GDP over the medium term, which would set the public debt to GDP
ratio on a slightly downward path. While recognizing that the announced tax cuts are affordable,
staff advised limiting their size or using the fiscal space for growth-enhancing measures.
48.
The ongoing tax reform is an opportunity to broaden the tax base and adjust to the
changing international taxation environment. The international tax transparency initiatives call
for closing loopholes used for tax avoidance. The tax reform should aim at widening the corporate
tax base, such as by phasing out the IP Box tax regime, and eliminating special tax regimes while
lowering statutory tax rates. The government should develop contingency measures, including
revisiting the low real estate taxes, in case negative revenue risks materialize.
49.
Continued reform of the pension system is advisable. Population ageing is expected to
put significant pressure on the system in the future, especially when cross-border workers begin to
retire. Accordingly, the ongoing 2016 pension review should propose additional parametric reforms

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

25

of the pension system, such as of the minimum contributions period and conditions for early
retirement.
50.
The government is appropriately taking steps to diversify the economy and reduce
unemployment. Expanding activity beyond the financial sector is important to enhance the
resilience of the economy and should be supported with measures to better align workers’ skills
with the economy’s demands and reduce inactivity traps while ensuring that real wages remain in
line with productivity. Structural reforms addressing supply-side constraints, such as easing zoning
requirements for real estate construction, could also help.
51.
Luxembourg is well-equipped to cope with elevated refugee inflows. The country’s
emphasis on enrollment of the newcomers into language classes, schools, and other training
programs is in line with best international practice.
52.
Staff recommends the next Article IV Consultation with Luxembourg be held on the
standard 12 month cycle.

Appendix I. Luxembourg: The EC State Aid Decision and
International Tax Transparency Initiatives
The EC state aid decision and international tax transparency initiatives limit Luxembourg’s and
other national authorities’ discretion to provide favorable tax treatment to multinational
companies, thereby reducing the latter’s incentives to conduct business through the country.
The EC has decided that the advance tax rulings of Fiat in Luxembourg and Starbucks in the
Netherlands and the Belgian "excess profit" tax scheme involved improper state aid.1 The EC
has requested the national tax authorities to recover the improper tax savings. For Fiat and
Starbucks, the repayments could amount to €20–30 million. Belgium would need to recover about
€700 million from at least 35 companies. The national authorities disagreed with the EC decision and
have appealed it at the European Court of Justice, which could take a few years to consider the
cases.
The EC decision sets an important precedent for reexamining tax treatment of multinational
companies in Luxembourg and across the EU. Currently, the EC is probing the legality of
Amazon’s and MacDonald’s advance tax rulings in Luxembourg and of Apple’s in Ireland, where
potential repayments can be much higher. Moreover, the same approach could be applied for reexamining tax payments of any company that obtained a favorable tax ruling from the national
authorities in Luxembourg and other EU countries over the last 10 years.
The EC decision comes on top of the EU and OECD/G20 push for tax transparency. In the EU,
the hitherto confidential national advance tax rulings have been open for bilateral exchange
between tax authorities upon request and will be automatically shared from 2017. This decision
followed “LuxLeaks” publications in late 2014 revealing that Luxembourg’s tax rulings allowed
companies to legally reduce their effective tax rates to as low as 1 percent. Meanwhile, the G20
summit in November 2015 endorsed recommendations of the OECD project on combating Base
Erosion and Profit Shifting (BEPS) that address harmful tax practices and pave the way for automatic
exchange of information for tax purposes from 2017. In the U.S., a proposal to tax overseas profits of
U.S. corporations—currently not subject to U.S. taxation until repatriated—stirred debates, but did
not make it to the “omnibus” budget bill adopted in December 2015.
Luxembourg has committed to greater transparency in its tax practices. The authorities
switched to automatic exchange of information on interest payments under the EU Savings Directive
from 2015. They also agreed to implement an extension of that Directive to cover account balances
and other sources of income including dividends from 2017. In late 2014, they committed to
implement the OECD Standard for Automatic Exchange of Financial Account Information. In January
2016, Luxembourg and 30 other OECD countries signed agreements for the automatic exchange of
country reports from 2017.

Appendix II. Luxembourg: External Sector Assessment
Staff assesses Luxembourg’s external position to be broadly consistent with its medium-term
fundamentals and desirable policies. The assessment is based on empirical analyses, a review of
developments in the balance of payments and net foreign asset position, as well as consideration
of Luxembourg’s status as a global financial center.
The current account surplus remained at
Real Effective Exchange Rate
(2005=100)
130
5½ percent of GDP in 2015. This reflected mainly
120
a strong surplus in services only partly offset by a
110
deficit in net factor income. As a result, the net
100
international investment position has improved to
90
about €16.5 billion (31.6 percent of GDP), with both
European Union (28 countries)
80
gross assets and liabilities increasing by roughly
Belgium
Germany
70
13¼ percent fueled by ample international liquidity.
France
Luxembourg
60
At end-2015, gross assets and liabilities reached
€9.5 trillion (about 180 the size of GDP),
highlighting Luxembourg’s role as a financial center.
After the financial crisis, Luxembourg’s real effective exchange rate (REER) has appreciated more
than its trading partners, suggesting a loss of competitiveness.
Source: Eurostat; deflator: unit labour costs; 37 trading partners.

Empirical estimates rely on the external-balance-assessment lite (EBA-lite). The EBA-lite
consists of three approaches: (i) the REER approach; (ii) the current account approach; and (iii) the
external sustainability approach. Given Luxembourg’s status as a financial center and the associated
difficulties with estimating external assets and liabilities and their income flows, the REER approach
is deemed the most appropriate.


The REER approach suggests a moderate
overvaluation of 8.6 percent. For the purpose of
estimating productivity, the working-age population
was adjusted to take into account the large number
of non-residents working in Luxembourg. Moreover,
the measure of trade openness used for Luxembourg
excluded exports and imports of financial services
(which are unlikely to be sensitive to relative price
effects).

STATISTICAL ISSUES
A. Assessment of Data Adequacy for Surveillance
General: Data provision is adequate for surveillance, although macroeconomic data are sometimes
released with a significant lag. The Central Service for Statistics and Economic Studies (Statec)
regularly publishes a full range of economic and financial data and provides an advance release
calendar for main statistical releases at http://www.statistiques.public.lu/fr/agenda/calendrierdiffusion/index.html.
Online access to Statec’s databases is available to all users simultaneously at the time of release
through the Statistics Portal of Luxembourg. Key publicly accessible websites for macroeconomic
data and analysis are:
Statistics Portal of Luxembourg
Statec
Central Bank of Luxembourg
Ministry of Finance

http://www.statistiques.public.lu/fr/
http://www.statec.public.lu/fr/index.html
http://www.bcl.lu/en/index.php
http://www.mf.public.lu/

National Accounts: Luxembourg avails itself of the flexibility under the Special Data Dissemination
Standard (SDDS) for the timeliness of its national accounts, generally disseminating national
accounts data not later than four months after the reference period (the SDDS timeliness
requirement for the national accounts is three months). Reduction of the reporting lag would aid
surveillance.

B. Data Standards and Quality
Luxembourg has been a subscriber to the SDDS since May 12, 2006. Luxembourg uses SDDS
flexibility options also on the timeliness of the analytical accounts of the central bank.
No data ROSC is available.

2016 ARTICLE IV CONSULTATION—SUPPLEMENTARY
INFORMATION
Prepared By

European Department

This supplement provides information that has become available since the issuance of
the staff report on April 21, 2016. The thrust of the staff appraisal is unchanged.
The authorities updated their fiscal projections and policy objectives in the
Stability and Growth Program released at end-April. The government agreed with
the EC proposal to lower Luxembourg’s medium-term objective (MTO) to a structural
fiscal deficit of 0.5 percent of GDP, but reaffirmed its commitment to keep the gross
public debt below 30 percent of GDP over the medium term. The government’s fiscal
deficit and public debt projections—underpinned by an upward revision of the
estimated fiscal surpluses in 2014–15—are consistent with those of the staff report.
The government estimates Luxembourg’s potential GDP growth at 3.2 percent, nearly
the same as estimated by staff. In view of the volatile international environment,
however, the authorities expect significant fluctuations of the projected GDP growth
around the long-term trend, while staff envisages a gradual convergence to it.

Statement by Mr. Menno Snel, Executive Director for Luxembourg
and Ms. Amela Hubic, Senior Advisor to the Executive Director
May 6, 2016
The Luxembourg authorities thank the staff for their comprehensive analysis and
constructive discussions during the mission in Luxembourg. The staff’s analysis provides an
objective view of the macroeconomic situation in the country and its economic challenges.
Economic outlook
The economic performance has been strong over the last three years, with an average real
GDP growth of 4.4 percent and close to 5 percent in 2015. Growth was mainly driven by
robust domestic demand and strong net services exports. Also, an AAA credit rating with a
stable outlook, a stable political and social environment, and sound public finances are key
elements that support Luxemburg’s economic growth.
The government projects the economy to grow by 2.9 in 2016 and on average by 3.8 percent
over the period 2017-2020. The somewhat lower projected medium-term growth compared
with the historical averages before the crisis is due to: (i) slower recovery of the euro area
economies; (ii) progressive exit from accommodative monetary policy in the euro area; and
(iii) less favorable stock exchange developments. However, this lower growth profile is
accompanied by positive developments in the labor market.
Strong and dynamic job creation led to an increase in employment of 2.5 percent.
Employment is projected to increase by 2.8 percent over the medium-term. Unemployment is
on a downward path thanks to the government’s active labor market policies that help
tackling the long-term unemployment of low-skilled workers. The unemployment rate was at
6.5 percent at the beginning of 2016, down from around 7 percent in 2014 and is projected to
continue to decrease over the medium-term to about 6 percent.
In line with the euro area trends and lower oil prices, average inflation remains low. This low
inflation environment limited the impact of the 2 percentage point increase in VAT rates in
2015. Over the medium term, inflation is projected to average 1.6 to 2 percent. The current
account recorded a surplus of 5.5 percent in 2015 and is expected to stay close to 5 percent in
the medium term, reflecting a surplus in services partly offset by a negative balance in goods.
Public finances
Luxembourg’s fiscal position remains sound and is one of the strongest in the euro area. The
budget balance recorded a surplus of around 1.3 percent of GDP on average over the last
three years, and the gross public debt level remains stabilized slightly above 20 percent of
GDP. The country has managed to maintain its low level of public debt as well as a
significant budgetary safety margin with respect to the Maastricht deficit reference value of
3 percent of GDP, demonstrating the government’s commitment to sound fiscal policies. In
this context, the government decided to adopt a lower medium term objective (MTO), a
structural deficit of 0.5 percent of GDP, over the period 2017–2019, which is in line with
new minima-requirements calculated by the EC.

2

In 2015, public finances were characterized by three main factors: (i) the entry into force of
the new regime for the VAT on e-commerce that resulted in a loss of 1 percent of GDP of
VAT revenues; (ii) the implementation of a multi-annual counter-financing strategy with an
impact of 0.7 percent of GDP in its first year; and (iii) the improvement of the
macroeconomic conditions with a positive impact on the government revenue. The
conjunction of these three elements allowed the general government balance to reach a
surplus of 1.3 percent of GDP—a much better outcome than initially estimated.
On February 29, 2016, the government announced the details of the tax reform which were
further specified on April 21. With this reform, the government wanted to improve the tax
system by making it more simple, competitive, efficient, and fair. The reform targets both the
companies and the households, but the latter are the largest beneficiaries. It will be
implemented as of January 1, 2017, and its cost is estimated around 0.6 and 0.8 percent of
GDP for the period 2017–2020. The non-neutral impact of this reform is justified by a
favorable general government balance over the last three years, the positive economic
outlook and the relatively low level of public debt.
The fiscal position is projected to remain in a small surplus over the medium term, even with
the cost of tax reform taken into account, well above the newly adopted MTO, and for the
entire 2017–2020 period. Public investment will also remain high over this period as the
government considers it to be important for the development and the potential growth of the
economy. The high level of investment is also justified by the population growth as well as
by the continuous increase of employment.
The debt-to-GDP ratio is at 21.6 percent of GDP in 2015, entirely denominated in euro and
well below the Maastricht debt reference value of 60 percent of GDP. It is worth noting that
significant assets to fund future pension liabilities -29.4 percent of GDP at the end of
2015-have been set aside in a specialized and dedicated fund. Also, taking all government
assets into account, the public sector is a net creditor. The public debt is projected to remain
around 23 percent of GDP over the period 2016-2020, demonstrating the government’s
commitment to keep the public debt below 30 percent of GDP.
Although the fiscal indicators are currently positive, the country is facing some structural
challenges that may impact its public finances. Potential growth has declined and the high
degree of openness of the economy and its specialization in financial services make public
revenues vulnerable to high volatility. Also, several tax initiatives—such as the OECD/G20
BEPS project or EU rule changes and investigations - that are underway might have some
consequences for the public revenues. The ageing population will also impact public finances
over the long-term. The government concurs with the staff’s view about the need to place the
old-age pension system on a sustainable path, and recognizes that a close monitoring of this
issue is required. As provided under the 2013 pension regime, the government can assess,
using actuarial studies, every 5 years, the consistency between the assumptions underlying
the reform and the updated financial trajectory of the scheme. This review has been advanced
by a year and is now taking place in 2016. In this context, the government took note of staff’s
recommendations and stands ready to consider them in this review. It is also worth

3
highlighting that the government has already put in place several initiatives with an objective
to delay the effective retirement age, such as, but not limited to, the reform of the preretirement regime, professional reclassification and the complementary pension amendments.
Financial sector
Luxembourg’s forward-looking financial sector remains resilient and sound. It is a financial
hub in the euro area that serves private and institutional clients around the world, and its
diversification continues with Fintech activities as the latest effort. The ongoing regulatory
changes at European and international levels represent challenges, closely monitored by the
authorities who stand ready to take the necessary measures aimed at consolidating and
strengthening the competitiveness and resilience of the financial sector in the long term.
Banking sector. The aggregate banking sector balance sheet has overall stabilized in the last
few years, reflecting an increase of asset values but also some new inflows. The
capitalization and liquidity ratios are sound, and the NPLs are very low. The banking sector
continues to be profitable and remains an important liquidity provider. The authorities share
the staff’s view that the European banking union is good for the euro area and is especially
beneficial for Luxembourg as the more integrated prudential oversight under the SSM will
eliminate potential ‘blind spots’ for the national supervisors, and strengthen the resilience of
the banking system. In this regard, the authorities believe that it is essential to complete the
banking union by putting in place a common European backstop for the single resolution
fund as well as the third pillar of the banking union, the common European deposit insurance
scheme. As for the oversight of nonbank holding companies of banks, discussed in 2015
Article IV Consultation, measures are taken to monitor ownership links at the time of
authorization.
Investment fund industry. As the staff rightly point out in their report, the growing investment
fund industry remains an important component of the financial system in Luxembourg. Over
the last few years, the industry has benefited from favorable financial markets and has
increased the amount of assets under management, also thanks to new inflows. It continues to
invest in a diversified class of assets and caters to a diverse pool of investors without any
major concentration risks. This diversification has been an important factor for the observed
resilience of the overall financial sector during past crises and continues to help buffer the
impact on financial market volatility on Luxembourg.
For this year’s Article IV consultation, the staff has used the investment fund industry in
Luxembourg as a case study. They presented a very detailed and thorough analysis of the
industry, and have taken a close look at the linkage between the investment fund industry and
the banks in Luxembourg. The authorities took note of the risk factors identified by staff.
However, they believe that it would have been beneficial to also present the benefits of a
growing investment fund industry for Luxembourg and for the euro area. Next to that it is
important to emphasize that a lot is already in place, and that the investment strategies of
investment funds are laid down in their prospectus and the management companies must
perform mandatory liquidity risk management and stress tests which are reviewed by the
Commission de Surveillance du Secteur Financier (CSSF). The existing EU Directives
provide a solid framework for risk monitoring, risk management and supervision of

4
Luxembourg’s investment funds. Furthermore, the authorities welcome the UCITS V and
AIFM Directives which have clarified and strengthened the role and the responsibilities of
the depository banks.
The recently established Systemic Risk Committee (SRC) will, among other duties, closely
monitor the links between the banks and the fund industry as well as the developments in the
housing market. This committee has already had its first discussions on this linkage on the
basis of the study conducted by the Banque centrale du Luxembourg (BCL)—who provides
the Secretariat to the SRC. In addition, the IMF’s FSAP exercise, which will take place this
year, is expected to cover this linkage. The authorities are looking forward to working closely
with the IMF staff during this exercise which will help strengthen Luxembourg’s financial
model further - proven to be resilient in the recent global crisis.
The increase of the capital of the BCL. The government has committed to finding a
progressive and sustainable solution to endow the BCL with adequate capital. The
discussions between the government and the BCL are ongoing.
Other issues
Diversification of the economy continues. The government continues to pay careful attention
to developing a climate conducive to business and investment, which should help pursuing
efforts to diversify the structure of the economy. Specific sectors of growth such as logistics,
ICT and bio- and eco-technologies have been chosen for this purpose. These diversification
efforts are already starting to bear fruit, in particular in the rapidly growing logistics sector.
The government continues to encourage innovation, looking for possible niches by using
some of the existing frameworks/infrastructure: a pan-European project to build a
supercomputer and a plan to create a legal framework for space mining are some of the latest
examples. Lastly, the diversification of the forward-looking financial sector across the
business activities, investment destinations and the customer bases is expected to further
enhance the diversification of the financial sector itself.
Recent influx of refugees from the Middle East. Luxembourg hosts around 3500 asylum
seekers since mid-2015, which account for nearly 0.5 percent of its population. The past
experience in handling refugee and migration flows as well as the population’s positive
attitude towards refugees, have helped the government to rapidly mobilize resources.
Drawing on this past experience, the government is aware that it is extremely important to
integrate refugees as quickly as possible. This is achieved by enrolling the children in schools
from day one, providing intensive language courses and issuing work permits rapidly. To be
able to do so - given the rapid influx of refugees - the government called on retired teachers
to return to part-time work. As for the diploma recognition, the government is eyeing the
German example. The government also reduced the time between the asylum application and
the work permit granted to refugees from 9 to 6 months, in order to allow them to enter the
labor market more quickly. Lastly, while it successfully managed to cope so far with the
refugee influx, thanks also to the sound fiscal position, any renewed strong influx of refugees
would likely put pressure on the country’s capacity to host.
