A mission visited Addis Ababa during June 10-25, 2004 to conduct the 2004 Article IV
Consultations, the sixth (and final) review of the PRGF, and to discuss the preliminary ex post
assessment of Fund-supported programs in Ethiopia. The team consisted of Mr. Basu (head),
Mr. Powell, Mr. Erasmus, Mr. Yamauchi (all AFR), Mr. Sobolev (PDR), Mr. Mattina (FAD),
Mr. Olafsson (MFD) and Ms. Pereira-Isaev (Senior Administrative Assistant, AFR). Mr. Kyei, the
Fund’s Resident Representative, participated in the work of the mission. Mr. Daniel (FAD), the head of
the ex post assessment team, traveled to Addis Ababa on June 22-24 for discussions on the draft ex post
assessment report. In the attached letter (Appendix I), the authorities request disbursement of the final
disbursement under the PRGF arrangement.

•

The last Article IV consultation with Ethiopia was completed on September 23, 2002. On that
occasion, Executive Directors encouraged the authorities to implement decisively structural reforms that
would enhance the efficiency and competitiveness of the economy. They urged the authorities to
persevere with their cautious expenditure policy, and stressed the need to improve the planning,
tracking, and reporting of public spending. They also urged a strengthening of the financial sector.

•

On February 27, 2004, the Executive Board concluded the fifth review under the PRGF
arrangement and endorsed the first annual progress report (APR) of the PRSP. Executive
Directors commended the authorities for their strong performance under the program, despite the
negative impact on the economy of the drought of 2001/02 and 2002/03. Directors stressed that it would
be crucial to implement all elements of the Commercial Bank of Ethiopia (CBE) restructuring plan.
They also underscored the importance of persevering with the other elements of the structural reform
agenda, including privatization, capacity building, the promotion of non-traditional exports, and support
for the private sector.

•

Subsequently, on April 20, 2004, the Executive Boards of the IMF and IDA agreed that Ethiopia
had met the conditions for reaching the completion point under the enhanced HIPC Initiative.
Directors also agreed that exceptional additional HIPC Initiative assistance should be granted to reduce
Ethiopia’s NPV of debt-to-exports ratio at end 2002/03 to the HIPC Initiative threshold of 150 percent,
if sufficient indications of participation are obtained from other creditors.

•

Relations with the Fund are presented in Appendix II; relations with the World Bank are described in
Appendix III; statistical issues are reviewed in Appendix IV, the authorities’ reactions to the ex post
assessment are detailed in Appendix V; and Appendix VI provides an alternative “Doubled Aid”
scenario.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
The issue of the border demarcation between Eritrea and Ethiopia remains unresolved.
The Development Assistance Group (DAG) of donor ambassadors in Ethiopia has
underscored the need to avoid escalating defense expenditures.
The PRGF program remains on track. All the quantitative performance criteria under the
PRGF for end-March 2004, the structural performance criteria for end-June 2004, as well as
all the benchmarks for these test dates have been met. In particular, the implementation of the
Commercial Bank of Ethiopia (CBE) restructuring plan has progressed as planned.
Ethiopia’s real GDP growth rebounded strongly (to 11.6 percent) during 2003/04. The
average annual inflation rate (about 11 percent as of May 2004) has fallen much less sharply
than earlier projected, mainly because food prices have declined at slower rates than earlier
expected. The nonfood inflation rate (4.2 percent) is also higher, mainly because of the rise in
import prices of selected inputs and the pass-through effects of a nominal effective
depreciation of the birr in the wake of the National Bank of Ethiopia’s (NBE's) policy of
closely tracking the dollar.
Following last year’s recovery, growth is expected to revert to trend. The staff project
lower real GDP growth (about 5.7 percent) in 2004/05 based on an assumption of normal
rains. This is about one percentage point below the authorities’ projection, a difference fully
explained by the staff’s more cautious assumption for the growth of agricultural yields.
The external current account deficit (including official transfers) is expected to widen in
2004/05 (to 8.7 percent of GDP), reflecting substantially lower official transfers.
The 2004/05 federal budget requires substantial domestic financing as spending
initiatives outpace revenue growth. The planned doubling of domestic resources allocated
to the Food Security Program (FSP) underlies the increase in total expenditures. In the
absence of higher grants, additional measures are required to reduce the deficit by about
2 percent of GDP to bring domestic borrowing requirement to a level consistent with
achieving the government’s inflation target.
The staff prepared two illustrative medium-term fiscal projections: the “double aid”
scenario (with higher public spending and growth) and a baseline scenario reflecting
recent trends more closely. In addition to higher external assistance, achieving the higher
growth objectives and absorbing the higher assistance required for achieving the Millennium
Development Goals (MDGs) will require an accelerated and determined implementation of
structural reforms to support rural and private sector development.
The authorities welcomed the ex post assessment as providing an opportunity to revisit
their performance over the last decade and to enhance their future policies. They were
concerned, however, that the report showed a lack of new thinking by the Fund, which was
still applying the “old paradigm” of the “Washington Consensus.” In their view, in the future,
the Fund’s seal of approval would be more important than the level of access.

I. INTRODUCTION
1.
On July 14, 2004, the IMF Executive Board extended through October 31, 2004 the
arrangement under the Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility (PRGF) approved on March
22, 2001, to allow time for the completion of the sixth review under the arrangement. The
attached letter from the Minister of Finance and Economic Development of Ethiopia and the
Governor of National Bank of Ethiopia (NBE), dated August 12, 2004 (Appendix I),
indicates that the performance criteria under the third annual program (covering fiscal year
July 8, 2003-July 7, 2004) supported by the PRGF arrangement were achieved, and requests
the final disbursement under the arrangement.
2.
The Article IV consultation discussions focused on the conclusions of the draft
ex post assessment report (EPA) and on the authorities’ macroeconomic policies and
structural reform strategy to achieve an acceleration of economic growth and the Millennium
Development Goals (MDGs). During these discussions, in line with the conclusions of the
EPA, the staff strongly encouraged the authorities to pursue a more ambitious reform strategy
than in the past. Section II describes economic performance in 2003/04. Section III reports on
the discussions, and Section IV presents the staff appraisal.
3.
Ethiopia continues to face political uncertainties, which are partly related to the
unresolved dispute with Eritrea on boundary demarcation and partly to the preparations for
the June 2005 elections. The Eritrea-Ethiopia Boundary Commission ruling (April 2002) that
the town of Badme would be located within Eritrea has ignited strong opposition to it in
Ethiopia, leading to protracted delays in the official demarcation of the border. However, the
Ethiopian government has said it will not go to war over Badme. The international
community’s efforts, including a recent U.N. initiative, have not succeeded so far in
resolving the impasse. Meanwhile, the Development Assistance Group (DAG) in Ethiopia
has underscored that the Government of Ethiopia should avoid escalating defense
expenditures while the border dispute remains unresolved. The DAG ambassadors have also
encouraged the Ethiopian authorities to invite international observers to the upcoming June
2005 election, and allow all political parties to participate on an equal footing in the public
debate prior to the election.
4.
Ethiopia ranks towards the bottom (170 out of 177 countries) in the 2004 Human
Development Index ranking, an assessment combining life expectancy, adult literacy,
primary school enrollment, and per capita income. The poverty reduction strategy paper
(PRSP) indicates that the poverty headcount index was 44.2 percent in 1999/2000 for the
country as a whole, down from 45.5 percent in 1995/96

Ethiopia’s real GDP growth
rebounded strongly (to 11.6 percent) during
2003/04, as agricultural production recovered
fully from the drought-affected levels of
2001/02-2002/03. Growth in the nonagricultural
sectors was also stronger (6.8 percent)
than earlier estimated, primarily reflecting the
impact of higher agricultural output on industrial
production and services activities.

much less sharply than earlier projected
(5.5 percent), mainly because both food and nonfood prices have declined at slower
rates than expected. The announcement of floor prices for cereals under the cereal price
support scheme operated by the Ethiopian Grain Trading Enterprise (EGTE) is likely to have
had a signaling impact on the prices at which cereals have been traded in the markets, and in
addition, a shift by some local aid agencies from imports to domestic purchases of cereals
may also have prevented food prices from falling in line with earlier seasonal patterns. The
introduction of warehousing facilities for farmers, moreover, has allowed them to store a part
of their crop after the harvest instead of having to sell it when prices are subject to downward
pressures. The nonfood inflation rate (4.2 percent in May 2004) is higher than earlier
expected, mainly because of the nominal effective depreciation of the birr on the exchange
market, as well as the rise in import prices of selected inputs.

Although the exchange rate vis-à-vis
the U.S. dollar has remained highly stable
through 2003/04 declining only slightly
from Birr/$ 8.60 in June 2003 to 8.63 in
May 2004, the exchange rate has
depreciated in nominal and real effective
terms quite noticeably (by about 8 percent
and 5 percent, respectively through endMarch 2004). Consistent with their policy of
avoiding a real appreciation, the authorities
indicated that they have been content to follow
the U.S. dollar and allow the birr to depreciate
against the euro. As a result, the nominal and
real effective exchange rates of the birr also
depreciated. Given the challenge of
stimulating more rapid growth, the authorities
indicated that the depreciation of the real

-7-

effective exchange rate was appropriate1.This policy has allowed the NBE to build up its net
foreign asset position above the programmed level to take advantage of a normal harvest year
and establish a stronger reserve cushion for coping with future exogenous shocks.
8.
The expansion of broad money through end-March 2004 (7.2 percent) was
considerably less than programmed (12.4 percent). Since the Government reduced its net
indebtedness to the banking system much more than programmed, the NBE was able to

fiscal year, the authorities indicated that they expect the full use of programmed domestic
credit which, combined with stronger than programmed growth in NFA, leads to projected
broad money growth for 2003/04 beyond the programmed level.

was contained below that
of domestic revenue. In nominal terms, revenue surpassed the program target because of
strong indirect tax receipts stemming from buoyant import growth and improved customs
administration, which more than offset lower-than-programmed direct taxes that reflected
weak corporate profits following the drought of 2002/03. However, the tax base could not
keep pace with the unexpectedly strong rebound in GDP, which was driven by the lightly
taxed agricultural sector. Consequently, tax revenue fell short of the program target by 0.7
percent of revised GDP. Similarly, recurrent and capital spending were largely in line with
the nominal program targets, but fell short as a share of GDP. Defense spending (Br. 2.4
billion) is expected to be held to the nominal program estimate, while poverty-reducing
expenditure is anticipated to slightly exceed the nominal target owing to higher-than-planned
capital spending in the education sector. The government has also implemented most of the
planned expenditure for food security, without recourse to any domestic credit in the first
nine months of 2003/04. However, the authorities anticipate a decompression of expenditures
in the final quarter that will fully utilize the available domestic credit under the program.
th

11.
The external current account deficit (including grants) is estimated to show a
smaller deficit than earlier projected, due to higher net inflows of official and private
transfers and a larger surplus in nonfactor services. The additional official grants reflected a
shift away from long-term lending by donors. In the capital account, although there was a
shortfall in disbursements of official long-term loans, this was offset by other unclassified
2

Although there exists a discount window, there is no demand for accommodation by the
central bank.

-9-

inflows (recorded under net errors and omissions), and net capital inflows were broadly in
line with the program estimate. Thus, the lower-than-programmed external current account
deficit was the primary factor contributing to an overall surplus in the balance of payments.
Under these circumstances, the NBE was able to build up its foreign reserves beyond the
program level.
12.
All the quantitative performance criteria for end-March 2004, the structural
performance criteria for end-June 2004, as well as all the benchmarks for these test dates
have been met, as shown in Appendix I, Tables 1 and 2.
13.
The implementation of the restructuring plan for the NBE was begun in January 2004.
Most of the recommendations made by KPMG, which covered all aspects of the restructuring
plan except job grading, salary scales, and review of manuals for policies and procedures,
were approved by the Board of the NBE. However, a number of key recommendations aimed
at increasing the autonomy of the central bank were rejected by the NBE Board. 3
14.
Almost all the recommendations under the safeguard assessments have been
implemented. The suggestion to strengthen the internal control system is planned to be
completed as part of the overall organizational restructuring, in particular, of the internal
audit department.
III. REPORT ON DISCUSSIONS
15.
Since the Fund emphasized the need for structural reforms to support sustainable
growth and poverty reduction in previous Article IV consultations, the discussions also
covered key areas of such reforms including liberalization of the external sector and interest
rates, the reorientation of spending to poverty alleviation, the speeding up of tax reform,
privatization, and the strengthening of the financial sector, including by removing barriers to
foreign bank entry (see sections IIB-IIIE below). Most of the immediate and distortionary
policies identified in previous consultations have been gradually overhauled, but the
authorities have remained cautious of greater market orientation in some key areas (see EPA
section II). In particular the authorities continue to believe that allowing foreign bank entry
would be premature (see paragraph 33 below). On the macroeconomic front, the authorities
have, on the whole, pursued fiscal, monetary, and exchange rate policies that have been
prudent and broadly in line with the Fund’s advice.

3

The following recommendations were rejected by the NBE Board: (a) limiting the
overruling of the Board’s decisions by the government to exceptional circumstances;
(b) limiting the removal of the Board members from office to their noncompliance with
qualifications; (c) granting tenure longer than the election cycle (six years); (d) setting
qualifications of Board members, including no conflict of interest; and (e) requiring the
governor to report annually to parliament.

- 10 -

16.
The discussions focused on the staff’s EPA and on its implications for developing
a sound framework of macroeconomic policies and structural reforms that could help
to achieve the MDGs by 2015. The EPA calls for the adoption of prudent debt management;
realistic projections for real growth, government revenues and foreign grants in developing
macroeconomic programs; more ambitious structural reforms; and programs that explicitly
incorporate policies to help cope with exogenous shocks.
17.
In responding to the conclusions of the EPA, the authorities welcomed the
opportunity to revisit performance under past programs. They suggested, however, that
the report should give greater recognition to significant recent reforms (e.g. in civil service
reform and agriculture). They also considered it important for the Fund to give thought to
alternative approaches to achieving development, and to avoid overemphasizing
“liberalization”. They acknowledged that Fund programs had been beneficial, and that
without them the outcomes would have been different. Looking forward, they indicated that
they would continue to take appropriately sequenced measures at their own pace, and based
on their own concrete analysis. They recognized that to make better progress towards the
MDGs and ensure that both the public sector and the private sector contributed to higher
growth, it would be important to focus not only on strengthening public expenditure
management and external aid mobilization efforts, but equally strongly concentrate on
supportive macroeconomic policies, and institutional and structural reforms.
18.
In line with the recommendations of the EPA, the staff developed a baseline
medium-term scenario based on recent trends and/or realistic projections of external
assistance and real GDP growth. At the authorities’ request, the staff also prepared a more
ambitious “Doubled Aid” scenario, which projected significantly higher external aid flows
and somewhat higher GDP growth than under the staff’s baseline. Regarding any future
arrangement, the authorities noted that while they considered high access to be appropriate,
Fund financing was relatively minor, and the key benefit of a Fund-supported program was
the policy framework and the seal of approval.
A. Achieving Higher Growth and the MDGs
19.
The baseline scenario for 2004/05 and beyond takes into account four basic
objectives. First, the projections for the real GDP growth rate (5.7 percent in 2004/05 and an
average of 5.3 percent per year for the period up to 2015) are somewhat less ambitious than
that of the authorities’ projections, because the projected increases in the ratios of investment
and savings to GDP, and agricultural productivity, and the pace at which these gains would
be realized are relatively more cautious than those of the authorities (Box 1)4. Second, the
4

In response to the concerns expressed in the EPA regarding optimistic growth projections,
the staff’s baseline growth projections are lower by about 0.5 percentage points than the base
projections presented in the completion point document (See HIPC Enhanced Initiative for
Heavily Indebted Poor Countries – Completion Point Document).

- 11 -

annual inflation rate would be contained to 3 percent consistent with the base case of the
APR of the PRSP. Third, foreign reserves would be maintained at a level that covers at least
four months of imports. Fourth, the ratio of total (domestic and foreign) debt to GDP would
be reduced gradually over time. To achieve these objectives, the targeted path of fiscal
deficits and the accompanying policies would play a central role in achieving the necessary
degree of monetary restraint, containing pressures on the price level and the external current
account, and achieving debt sustainability.
20.
In contrast, under the doubled aid scenario, the authorities expect a marked
acceleration of real GDP growth that is needed to achieve the income poverty goal of
halving the number of people living in poverty by 2015. To this end, based on estimates of
the income elasticity of poverty and strong implementation of their reform program, the
authorities are targeting an average annual growth rate of about 7 percent, compared with
4.0 percent achieved during 1991/92-2003/04. This would require significant increases in
agricultural productivity, and the ratios of savings and investment to GDP. The authorities,
however, expect that as a result of the envisaged intensity and implementation of supporting
structural and institutional reforms, these critical variables would increase well above
historical trends.
21.
The path of annual fiscal deficits (excluding grants) under the baseline would
need to be contained to about 10 percent of GDP over the medium term, based on recent
trends in official aid receipts (9 percent of GDP) and on a policy of containing new domestic
borrowing as a share of GDP (to about 1 percent of GDP). Over the longer term, the ratio of
revenues to GDP is expected to rise gradually, reflecting ongoing capacity building and
improved revenue buoyancy as non-agricultural growth picks up, allowing scope for
increasing the ratio of total expenditures to GDP, and eventually for reducing the dependence
on aid. Under this fiscal scenario, the government would be able to reduce gradually the
currently high ratios of its domestic and foreign debt to GDP to more sustainable levels.
Moreover, by limiting its domestic borrowing, it would provide scope for adequate annual
increases in bank credit to the nongovernment sector within annual targets for monetary
expansion that are consistent with holding the annual inflation rate at about 3 percent. A
significant risk in successfully implementing the baseline scenario is the reoccurrence of a
severe drought, which strikes about every third year on average, as noted in the ex post
assessment discussion.
22.
The baseline scenario assumes new external borrowing over the medium term to
be limited consistent with the baseline scenario presented at the HIPC initiative
completion point, with increased grants allowing total assistance to remain broadly at their
current levels as a share of GDP. While the envisaged lending program will keep the debt
stock elevated for some time, the debt-service ratios are projected to remain manageable over
the projection horizon reflecting the long maturity periods on existing debt and projected
future financing.

- 12 -

23.
In contrast to the baseline, the “doubled aid” scenario entails a rapid expansion in
poverty-reducing expenditure financed by an inflow of external grants (Box 2).5 The budget
deficit (excluding grants) would balloon to over 20 percent of GDP to finance higher
poverty-reducing spending by 15 percent of GDP by 2015/16. In contrast, the deficit
including grants would decline gradually to just 2.3 percent of GDP by 2015/16 as domestic
fiscal effort steadily improves6. Expenditure would need to focus on recurrent items in light
of the high wage component of addressing the shortage of teachers and medical staff that will
be essential for achieving the MDGs in health and education7. Consequently, the government
sector wage bill would increase by 4½ percent of GDP by 2015/16. The domestic public debt
would decline and inflation would be contained (to 6 percent) by limited recourse to
domestic financing at less than 1 percent of GDP per annum8. However, assumed donor
assistance would increase by $5 billion per annum by 2015/16, before shifting to a downward
trend. Under this scenario, the staff stressed the importance of containing any emerging wage
pressures and maintaining adequate monetary restraint consistent with the inflation target,
and noted that the scaling up of aid inflows also required aid coordination efforts to ensure
predictability and firm forward-looking commitments from donors, as well as simplification
and harmonization of donor conditionality and aid delivery practices.

5

The scenario assumes a doubling of the ratio of on-budget receipts of foreign grants and
loans to GDP from 11 percent in 2003/04 to 22 percent in 2015/16.

6

External borrowing in the “doubled aid” scenario is limited to be consistent with the high
case scenario presented at the time of the completion point in April 2004, when the projected
debt burden was considered to be sufficiently high as to warrant topping-up of HIPC
Initiative assistance.
7

Attracting and retaining sufficient health personnel to deliver required health services could
demand significant increases in wages. Containing more generalized wage inflation pressures
in the rest of the economy would be important for protecting private investment and
employment.

8

Under the doubled aid scenario money velocity is assumed to decline slightly from the
current level of 1.87 to about 1.78 by 2015, while broad money grows by about 1315 percent per annum.

- 13 -

Box 1. Assumptions Underlying the Medium-Term Growth Projections
Ethiopia’s PRSP (the SDPRP) indicates that real GDP growth should average about 6 percent per year in
order to achieve the MDG income poverty goal of halving the number of people living in poverty. The
authorities believe that average annual real GDP growth of 7.0 percent could be achieved over the medium term.
Achieving growth of this magnitude on a sustainable basis would, however, require a significant
improvement on the experience of the past 13 years. Annual real GDP growth during 1991/92-2003/04
averaged 4.0 percent, while potential growth is estimated at about 4.4 percent (Table 1). The staff’s baseline
scenario assumes implementation of a reform program and higher agricultural productivity than in the past,
which yields higher GDP growth, averaging about 5.5 percent annually.
The following are the main differences between the staff baseline projection and that of the authorities:
• the authorities’ projection is based on a doubling of official aid flows as a share of GDP;
• regarding agricultural production, the staff projects crop yields to improve by an average of 4 percent
per year, compared with the authorities’ projection of 9 percent – this compares with an average
increase of 1.4 percent per year during 1993/94-2003/04;
• applying a growth accounting framework, and taking into account projections for gross domestic
investment and labor, the staff’s projection implies a contribution from total factor productivity (TFP)
of 1.1 percentage points; in the authorities’ projection, this would imply a TFP contribution of
1.7 percentage points; and
• the authorities’ projection implies a further substantial increase in the ratio of investment to GDP.
Compared with the staff’s projection of an increase in the ratio to an average of 22 percent during
2004/05-2020/21, the authorities’ growth projection implies a ratio of 31.4 percent of GDP. The staff
projects an improvement in gross domestic savings to about 8 percent of GDP from 2.3 percent during
1991/92-2003/04, compared with the authorities’ projection of about 11 percent of GDP. The
authorities’ projections thus imply a significant resource gap, averaging about 23 percent of GDP
during 2004/05-2020/21.

Box 2. Achieving the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) in Ethiopia.
Ethiopia is confronting pressing social deficits with respect to achieving universal primary education,
addressing gender disparity, enhancing basic health care coverage, and reversing the spread of major
diseases.
Health: Only 62 percent of the population enjoy access to basic health care services, while the
prevalence of HIV/AIDS is estimated to impact about 2 million people;
Education: Completion rates in primary education are low with over half of students dropping out by
grade 3, while enrollment in secondary schools is only 14 percent;
Population dynamics: Large investments will be required just to maintain the currently low level and
quality of public service given an estimated fertility rate of 5.9 children per woman of childbearing age
that will boost the population by 50 percent within 20 years;
Water: Just one quarter of the population has access to safe drinking water, and only 15 percent has
access to sanitation services; and
Transport, telecommunications and power: Ethiopia has low road density at just 27 km/1000km3,
compared to 50 in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). Telecommunications and internet connectivity are also
low with just 4 telephone lines per 1,000 people, compared to an average of 14 in SSA.
Achieving the MDGs will require a substantial increase in donor assistance. Aid flows presently amount
to just $13 per capita compared to the SSA average of $23. In light of this, and guided by the pattern of
expenditure in the “extended PRSP” scenario detailed in the World Bank’s Public Expenditure Review,
the fiscal impact of doubling foreign assistance as a share of GDP is assessed relative to a baseline
scenario that incorporates prudent revenue forecasts, existing expenditure priorities and current trends in
donor support. The “doubled aid” scenario assumes that the increase in required resources over the
baseline is disbursed in the form of higher grants, reflecting Ethiopia’s tight external debt position.
Consistent with this scenario, donor support would increase gradually through 2015/16 to reach about $6
billion, enabling poverty-reducing spending to attain $78 per capita compared to just $20 in 2003/04.
The wage bill also increases significantly as higher social spending is allocated to recurrent spending
needs in education and health care, which entail large wage components. The budget deficit excluding
grants increases sharply to over 20 percent of GDP by 2015/16, raising concerns about the sustainability
of donor financing after 2015/16.

that would rise to 6.7 percent, jeopardizing a sustained decline in both the inflation rate and
the ratio of public debt to GDP.
25.
With respect to the revenue projections for 2004/05, nongrant revenue is
projected by staff to decrease by 0.2 percent of GDP after incorporating prudent
projections for receipts from corporate profit taxes and indirect taxes on imports, and
recognizing the authorities’ envisioned downward path in nontax revenue. The former
was based on a less substantial jump than assumed by the authorities and the previous staff
projection, which reflects a more cautious forecast in the recovery of financial and industrial
sector profits from currently depressed levels. In the staff’s estimates, the large
overperformance in import duties during 2003/04 is only partially carried forward into the
2004/05 projection, reflecting lower projected import growth.9 The authorities explained that
they had taken into account the full-year impact of the revenue measures implemented in the
course of 2003/04, notably those relating to the strengthening of both customs administration
and tax enforcement procedures.
26.
The authorities project higher spending in 2004/05 by 0.6 percent of GDP, led by
a doubling of the Food Security Program (FSP) and higher defense and povertyreducing expenditure. The authorities envision defense expenditure returning to the

nominal level (Br. 3 billion) initially budgeted in 2003/04 after compressing military
spending this year in light of an expected revenue shortfall. Poverty reducing expenditures
increase as a share of GDP (to 18.4 percent). The staffs’ revised projection entails lower
recurrent spending on “other” items to contain spending growth, as the authorities expressed
optimism that a switch to performance-based budgeting in 2004/05 would contribute to
securing additional savings in this area. The mission also suggested that the scaling-up of
FSP outlays be phased in with concurrent steps to ensure greater accountability in the use of
transfers by regional governments, preferably through more timely external audits of
achieved outcomes. There is also a need to address the lack of capacity to absorb additional
FSP transfers in several regions. The staff also noted that these efforts to contain spending in
light of tighter financing could be facilitated if the authorities reconsidered the proposed
increase in defense spending as a share of GDP.
27.
Taking into account the expected net foreign financing, the staff urged the
authorities to limit the government’s domestic borrowing requirement to 1.5 percent of
GDP in 2004/05, with a view to achieving a decline in the inflation rate and in the ratio
of domestic debt to GDP. Additional measures to reduce the deficit by about 2 percent of
GDP would be required to bring the domestic borrowing requirement to a level consistent
with achieving the objective of reducing the public debt, and containing monetary expansion
in line with the government’s inflation target10. In view of this and the expected near term
deterioration of the external debt situation, the strategy should be to significantly reduce
domestic debt as a share of GDP, and set total public debt on a downward path over the
medium term. To this end, the staff stressed the importance of developing and publicizing a
comprehensive debt management strategy covering all public debt (both domestic and
external). The strategy should articulate clear limits to the acceptable level of borrowing with
appropriate steps to ensure that all government borrowing decisions are only approved if
consistent with its public debt strategy.
28.
The authorities considered the staff’s tax revenue projections to be too cautious.
They agreed, however, that it was important to continue to seek additional donor grants to
support the expansion of the food security program. They stressed that they would continue
to monitor budget developments closely ensuring that government borrowing remained
consistent with medium-term sustainability, and that private borrowing and investment was
not crowded out.
29.
Structural fiscal reforms in tax and customs administration will continue after
making significant progress during 2003/04. Tax collection and enforcement procedures
are being improved by putting in place effective tools to collect tax arrears, including
10

The ratio of the NPV of public debt to GDP remains large—about 55 percent—at end2003/04, using the methodology of the new low income country (LIC) debt template (See
Debt Sustainability in Low-Income Countries – Proposal for an Operational Framework and
Policy Implications).

- 17 -

applying liens on property and account balances, and preparing auctions for seized property
next year (the non-filing rate has improved from over 35 percent of taxpayers to under
20 percent since the new procedures were established this fiscal year). Customs
administration is also being substantially improved by recruiting college graduates to bolster
human capital, providing enhanced training and streamlining clearing procedures for goods
and facilitating collections. As the authorities’ attention shifts increasingly to revenue
administration from tax policy, the mission suggested making efforts to improve the valueadded tax (VAT) refund mechanism in light of low refund requests by international
standards, possibly as a result of overly stringent auditing and enforcement procedures.
30.
Reform priorities in public expenditure management in 2004/05 will focus on
bolstering local government capacity after two waves of major fiscal decentralization.
The authorities identified reform priorities for 2004/05 consistent with the key
recommendations of the second Assessment and Action Plan (AAP) for tracking povertyreducing spending, which include (i) improving budget reporting to facilitate timely general
government consolidation by revising and extending the chart of accounts to all regions;
(ii) automating budget accounting systems, networking regional governments and rolling out
double-entry cash accounting to all regions; (iii) clearing the backlog of unaudited accounts
to under one year from over five years; (iv) continuing the civil service overhaul; (v)
enhancing cash management; and (vi) improving budget formulation and reporting by
reaching agreement with donors on a standardized reporting form to more accurately estimate
all inflows and their destination, including grant-financed project spending.
C. Monetary Policy and Financial Sector Reforms
31.
The authorities have targeted monetary expansion to be in line with their
projection of nominal GDP growth. This assumes a somewhat higher GDP growth than the
staff projection and a small decline in the income velocity of money that is not assumed in
the staff projection. The staff explained that in the present environment of stronger
inflationary pressures and financially weak banks, it would be prudent to avoid projecting a
decline in velocity. As the authorities plan to build up foreign reserves at a slower pace than
last year, their monetary target for 2004/05 allows for a substantial increase in credit to the
nongovernment sector in addition to the planned increase in credit to government. The staff
explained that such a stance of monetary policy carried serious risks of magnifying the
current inflationary pressures. To avoid this risk, the staff recommended the adoption of
more moderate targets for the expansion of money and credit to the government.
32.
While progress is being made to address the restructuring needs of financial
institutions, further efforts are needed to resolve the structural problems facing the
CBE, the CBB and the DBE, and to strengthen the capacity for bank supervision.11 The
11

and the DBE is the Development Bank of Ethiopia.

- 18 -

staff noted that by exploiting the restructuring and reform of state-owned banks and ensuring
that they become financially viable, they would be better able to expand their financial
intermediation role. While the implementation of the CBE restructuring plan has progressed
as planned (Box 3), a continued full implementation of the plan is essential in 2004/05. As
the privatization of the CBB has been postponed again due to a delay in preparing up-to-date
audited accounts, completing this task as quickly as possible would help move the
privatization process forward. Since the financial situation of the DBE has remained weak
despite the financial restructuring implemented in 2003, a comprehensive audit will need to
be conducted to provide the basis for developing a new financial restructuring plan for the
DBE. The staff noted that the supervision department of the NBE had conducted on-site
inspections (30 in total) and developed corrective actions that the banks subsequently
implemented. Nonetheless, since the inspections have not been as frequent as required (once
in every year), and the supervision department has suffered from a loss of experienced staff,
due in particular to insufficient remuneration, the mission suggested that steps be taken to
address these issues.
Box 3. Restructuring of the Commercial Bank of Ethiopia (CBE)—Update
Restructuring of the CBE has been implemented as planned so far. A comprehensive financial
restructuring of the CBE started in November 2003 with a view for the CBE to becoming a sound and
profitable bank. The CBE instituted a policy to limit rescheduling/renewal of nonperforming loans
(NPLs) to two iterations in January 2004, as a prior action of the PRGF fifth review, and two
structural performance criteria for end-June 2004 have been implemented: (i) removal of the
maximum annual write-off limit of Br.100 million in May 2004 through the approval of a revised
write-off policy by the CBE Board; and (ii) transfer of cofinanced loans (Br .1,029 million) in June
2004 from the CBE to the DBE in exchange for a government-guaranteed bond (Br.392 million) with
discount factor equivalent to the amount of the provisions already constituted on these loans (Br.637
million). According to the Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) co-signed by the CBE, the DBE,
and the MOFED in June 2004, the government-guaranteed bond will be repaid out of state dividends
by the CBE during 2003/04-2004/05 (projected to be Birr 189 million in 2003/04 and Br.524 million
in 2004/05). Following the removal of the annual write-off limit, the authority to write-off loans was
transferred in June 2004 from the Board of the CBE to management.
From end-June 2003 through end-March 2004, NPLs declined, while capital increased. The ratio
of NPLs to total loans at end-March 2004 declined to 46 percent (including the Djibouti branch loans)
from 54 percent at end-June 2003 through a combination of cash collection, rescheduling/renewals,
and foreclosures. The ratio is estimated to have declined further by end-June 2004, with the transfer
of cofinanced loans to the DBE and the write-off by Br.20 million already implemented as planned.
The capital adequacy ratio rose to 13.2 percent at end-March 2004 (before state dividend payment)
from 10 percent at end-June 2003. The financial restructuring plan envisages the NPLs to decline to
37 percent of total loans by end-June 2004, while the risk-weighted capital adequacy ratio will remain
above 10 percent. Audited accounts are expected to become available in October 2004

33.
The staff believes that financial sector reform should be accelerated. Over the
medium term, financial sector reforms should aim at promoting financial intermediation and
the growth of savings and investment, and at providing the NBE with the necessary

- 19 -

instruments for actively controlling reserve money and influencing market-determined
interest rates. The staff noted that by allowing foreign bank entry and addressing the near
monopoly status of the CBE, competition in the banking sector and efficiency could be
enhanced. By ensuring that access to financial services—savings and credit—is fully
extended to the rural sector, a significant constraint to agricultural production could be
alleviated. To meet the credit needs of small- and medium-size enterprises, it would help to
extend the range of lending instruments beyond short-term, collateral-based credit. The
savings mobilization effort could be strengthened by introducing appropriate savings
instruments that carry positive real interest rates. The staff also stressed that prudent
monetary policies would have to be pursued by containing any inflationary domestic bank
financing to the government, and when necessary, by sterilizing the monetary impact of any
excessive external inflows and contain inflationary pressures. The authorities indicated that
they will continue their efforts to enhance efficiency in the financial sector. They consider,
however, that they are not yet ready to allow foreign banks to enter the financial sector, and
that priority should continue to be given to strengthening the domestic banks and enhancing
supervision by the NBE. The staff and the authorities agreed on the importance of fostering
microfinance institutions.
D. Other Structural Reforms
34.
As noted in the EPA, accelerating growth will require an accelerated implementation
of structural reforms in collaboration with the World Bank. While the authorities have made
significant progress during the past year with the implementation of such reforms in support
of rural and private sector development, a number of important challenges remain.
•

The staff stressed that significantly accelerating growth in agricultural production
would require rapid progress in improving (a) the functioning of input and output
markets, (b) access to rural financing, (c) security of land tenure, (d) technical support
and capacity building, and (e) the pursuit of vigorous risk management mechanisms.

•

With regard to private sector development, it would be important to achieve
significant progress in privatizing the remaining public enterprises, removing the
impediments to private sector development and foreign trade identified in the
Diagnostic Trade Integration Study (DTIS).12 Equally important would be

12

Ethiopia scores 6 (moderately restrictive) on the Fund's Trade Restrictiveness Index. Major
reforms recommended by the DTIS include (i) reducing the anti-export bias of the tariff
policy; (ii) encouraging export diversification; (iii) strengthening export promotion services;
(iv) developing the export potential of agriculture, manufacturing and tourism;
(v) strengthening the institutions for formulating trade policy, and analyzing trade-related
issues; (vi) strengthened customs administration; (vii) ensuring WTO accession; (viii)
improving access to infrastructure services; and (ix) improving the legal and regulatory
environment.

- 20 -

implementing the Industrial Development Strategy and current initiatives to integrate
Ethiopia’s economy into the global economy (including accession to the WTO,
participation in the COMESA FTA, and the EU EPA).
•

Finally, the authorities were also encouraged to press ahead with their ongoing efforts
to enhance the efficiency of the Customs Authority, revise the federal urban land
lease law, revise the recently adopted Competition Policy to clarify that regulations
are intended only to limit anti-competitive behavior, further strengthen dialogue with
the private sector, and to improve access to telecommunications services, including
through the partial liberalization of the sector.
E. External Projections and Policies

35.
Over the period 2004/05–2006/07, the external current account deficit (excluding
official grants) is projected to narrow progressively as a percent of GDP. With export
volume growing more strongly than import volume and some improvement in the terms of
trade over the outer years, the trade deficit is also forecast to narrow somewhat. Despite the
recent expansion of Ethiopian Air Lines’ (EAL) fleet of aircrafts, the net inflows of services
as well as private transfers are projected to decline relative to the exceptionally high levels of

lower debt service payments resulting from recent debt relief under the HIPC Initiative and
bilateral debt cancellations, the overall balance of payments is expected to shift to a large
deficit. Moreover, as the capital account surplus is projected to decline over the outer years,
the overall balance will continue to be in substantial deficit. Consequently, the foreign
reserves cover of imports is likely to decline, though remaining within a comfortable range of
4.5-5 months of imports.
36.
The current level of the exchange rate does not suggest a competitiveness
problem. Services and noncoffee exports have been growing strongly and coffee export
volume has also risen over the past year, despite a decline in prices. Nonetheless in the
staff’s view, a significant real appreciation should be avoided going forward. The speedy
implementation of measures to (i) further liberalize the foreign trade regime, (ii) eliminate

- 21 -

any remaining exchange restrictions,13 (iii) streamline customs procedures, (iv) improve
access to credit, land availability, competition policies, and infrastructure would go a long
way towards achieving this objective.14 Moreover, the suggested stance of monetary restraint
and the implementation of proposed measures that increase productivity and cost efficiency
would help to strengthen competitiveness further. With the increased openness of the
economy to foreign trade and monetary policy geared towards achieving the inflation
objective, the staff recommended that the exchange rate be allowed to be fully marketdetermined, with NBE’s interventions in the foreign exchange market being limited only to
smoothing out fluctuations and reducing the volatility of the exchange rate. While broadly
agreeing with this approach, the authorities noted that that they intend to avoid any real
appreciation of the currency. They furthermore noted that while they have implemented a
number of the structural reforms to improve competitiveness, they were at this stage not
considering further trade liberalization as this might adversely affect domestic industries.
37.
The authorities indicated that they are negotiating with Paris Club creditors the
bilateral agreements resulting from the recent agreement to provide debt relief, including
topping-up at the completion point under the HIPC Initiative (Box 4). They will also seek
comparable treatment from all other official bilateral and commercial creditors. They
indicated that they are preparing, with the help of the World Bank and Debt Relief
International (DRI), a public debt strategy that will cover both external and domestic debt,
although they expressed a view that the focus of external debt sustainability should be on
expanding exports rather than constraining borrowing. Similarly, on domestic debt, they
noted that the burden on the budget was low (due to low or negative real interest rates), and
that they would rely on future revenue growth to contain it, particularly if domestic interest
rates were to rise to positive levels in real terms.

13

The remaining restrictions include (a) the tax certification requirement for repatriation of
investment income; (b) restrictions on repayment of legally entered into external loans and
supplies and foreign partner’s credits; (c) rules for issuance of import permits; and (d) the
requirement to provide a clearance certificate from NBE to obtain import permits.

14

The recently completed DTIS and recommendations of the Technical Committee also
provides appropriate guidance on these issues.

Box 4. Summary of the Paris Club Agreement on the Provision of Debt Relief Under the Enhanced HIPC
Initiative
The representatives of the Paris Club creditor countries met in May 2004 and agreed (with one creditor still in
the process of taking the necessary legislative steps to join the consensus) on a recommendation to their
governments to implement their share of the debt relief effort (including topping-up) approved by the Boards of
IMF and IDA at the completion point under the enhanced HIPC initiative. According to the terms of the
agreement, the following principal amounts will be cancelled: (i) 100 percent of non-ODA pre-cutoff
government and government-guaranteed debt; (ii) 100 percent of the consolidated loans from the 1992 and 1997
Paris Club consolidation agreements; (iii) 22 percent of non-ODA consolidated loans under the Debt Reduction
option from the 2001 consolidation agreement (as amended in 2002; and (iv) (74 minus eDR13/05/04) percent
of non-ODA consolidated loans under the Debt Service Reduction option from the 2001 consolidation
agreement (as amended in 2002) where eDR13/05/04 is a ratio calculated to achieve a comparable debt
reduction between creditors who chose the Debt Reduction option and creditors who chose the Debt Service
Reduction option in the previous consolidation agreements. The terms of the agreement are therefore more
favorable than assumed by the staff under the completion point, and will provide Ethiopia with debt relief of
about $83 million more in NPV terms than assumed by the staff. In addition to the agreed terms of treatment,
most of the Paris Club creditors committed on a bilateral basis to grant additional cancellations of up to 100
percent of their claims.

F. PRSP Process
38.
In May 2004, a multiagency mission of major donors, assessed progress with SDPRP
actions and indicators as the basis for providing new financing for SDPRP implementation.
The agencies intending to provide direct budget support (DBS) indicated an intention to
streamline and harmonize the budget support process. During discussions, the authorities
indicated the intention to prepare a second annual progress report (APR) by December 2004
and to take into account the issues raised by the staff in the joint staff assessment of the first
APR.
G. Statistics and Technical Assistance
39.
The authorities continued to make progress with the implementation of
initiatives to improve the quality and comprehensiveness of macroeconomic data, and
the timeliness of dissemination. While the Medium-Term National Statistical Plan
(MTNSP) has not yet been approved by the Office of the Prime Minister, the Central
Statistical Authority (CSA) has started implementation of initiatives aimed at broadening the
coverage of macroeconomic data.15 To this end, the CSA conducted a Census of Economic
Establishments in March 2004, and technical assistance was requested through the GDDS
15

The MTNSP consists of three main objectives, namely enhancing the legal status of the
CSA, expanding the capacity of the CSA, and improving the coverage and dissemination of
data.

- 23 -

Initiative for the compilation of a production price index and an index of manufacturing
production. Regarding the rebasing of the national accounts, the authorities have decided to
establish 1999/2000 as base year, rather than the previously planned 1995/96--the authorities
expect this work to be finalized by August 2004. In the area of monetary data, a follow-up
STA technical assistance (TA) mission is planned for September 2004 to continue efforts at
improving the classification of the data.
40.
The government has made some progress in addressing the previously identified
deficiencies in external debt management. The Credit Administration Department of the
Ministry of Finance is in the process of upgrading its debt management software and
providing training to staff with the support of UNDP and UNCTAD. In addition, a Debt
Management Committee is soon to be established at a technical level to strengthen the
coordination among the various departments of the ministry and the NBE. Furthermore, to
facilitate aid delivery and interagency coordination, the government is in the process of
launching the centralized Aid Management Platform which would allow both the government
(federal and regional) and donors to get a better grip on the amount of foreign assistance
delivered and its timing, modalities, recipients, and end use.
41.
Efforts aimed at improving data on poverty and social indicators include plans to
conduct the Household Income, Consumption and Expenditure Survey (HICES), and Welfare
Monitoring Survey during 2004/04–the latter also will include a number of indicators relating
to HIV/AIDS.
IV. STAFF APPRAISAL
42.
Performance under the three-year PRGF-supported program has been good.
Despite the impact of the recent drought, price stability has been maintained, and significant
progress has been made with key structural reforms, in particular the commencement of the
restructuring plan for CBE and the strengthening of public expenditure management. All the
quantitative and structural performance criteria required for the completion of the final
review have been achieved. Reaching the HIPC Initiative completion point has also allowed
Ethiopia’s external debt to be reduced and brought scheduled debt service obligations to
more manageable levels.
43.
Ethiopia nonetheless remains highly vulnerable to external shocks, and poverty
indicators continue to be among the highest in the world. Achieving faster growth and the
Millennium Development Goals will require higher levels of external aid, but also
improvements in the capacity to effectively absorb and use such assistance through
accelerated implementation of financial sector and other structural reforms (largely to
support rural and private sector development). Higher inflows of external aid could be
facilitated by a peaceful resolution of the border dispute with Eritrea and the continued
reorientation of public resources to poverty related expenditures.
44.
Achieving the MDGs will require significantly greater levels of external
assistance, and this will need to be largely in the form of grants if debt sustainability is to be

- 24 -

maintained. It will be important for the authorities to develop a comprehensive and prudent
public debt management strategy which clarifies the rules for containing future domestic and
external borrowing to sustainable levels. Consistent with any scenario involving a significant
increase in external assistance as a share of GDP, the authorities’ medium-term fiscal
framework needs to involve a rebalancing of expenditure to recurrent items, given large gaps
in the required number of teachers and medical personnel. The staff strongly supports the
authorities’ plan to develop their own fiscal scenarios aimed at achieving the MDGs, but
recommends continued close consultation with donors and the Fund, to identify the
challenges early and mitigate any potential adverse effects on the broader macro framework
arising from a substantial scaling-up of inflows of donor assistance. Significantly higher
external assistance would necessarily imply a large deterioration in fiscal and external
balances (excluding grants), leaving Ethiopia even more dependent on foreign aid than it is
today.
45.
Fiscal policy should continue to focus on strengthening expenditure management
and enhancing revenues, while containing inflationary domestic financing and reducing
the public debt burden. In view of the projected higher level of domestic borrowing needed
to finance the 2004/05 budget and the recent pickup in nonfood inflation, however, it will be
important to take additional measures to achieve the desired reductions in the debt and the
inflation rate. While the staff welcomes the food security program, its implementation should
be supported by adequate efforts to strengthen the capacity of local governments to absorb
the substantially higher federal transfers, and seek additional donor grants. The latter could
be facilitated if the authorities prepared timely external audits of the achieved outcomes. The
staff would caution the authorities against institutionalizing the scheme to guarantee the
minimum price for maize, wheat and sorghum, to avoid any direct budgetary costs resulting
from the scheme, and instead to address the underlying causes of price volatility by
improving performance in the agricultural sector and tackling market fragmentation.
46.
Significant progress has already been achieved with fiscal structural reforms.
Improving public expenditure management remains a critical priority, especially for
bolstering the capacity of local governments, given their new expenditure mandates
following fiscal decentralization. It is crucially important to continue to progress with
consolidating the general government accounts in a timely manner, including regular
reporting. Moreover, efforts to consolidate the gains made in improving customs
administration should continue, and the VAT refund mechanism should be carefully
reviewed along with other audit and enforcement guidelines, to avoid imposing an overly
restrictive tax environment that discourages investment and growth.
47.
Monetary and exchange rate policies will need to focus on achieving the
authorities’ inflation and international reserve targets. The case that the exchange rate
should be weaker is not compelling. Nonetheless the staff considers that a significant real
appreciation of the exchange rate going forward should be avoided. The authorities should
seek to safeguard external competitiveness through structural reforms that improve
productivity and efficiency. Measures to further liberalize foreign trade, eliminate remaining
exchange restrictions, streamline customs procedures, and implement the recommendations

- 25 -

in the DTIS would support these objectives. Moreover, the exchange rate should be allowed
to be fully market-determined, with NBE’s interventions in the market being limited only to
smoothing out fluctuations.
48.
In order to lay firm foundations for achieving a sustained increase in long-term
growth compared with the recent past, it will be essential to expedite the
implementation of the government’s structural reform agenda. Necessary reforms focus
on agriculture (especially enhancing land tenure security), food security, capacity building,
export promotion, privatization, and strengthening the legal and regulatory framework. In the
financial sector, while progress has been made with strengthening bank supervision and
implementing the restructuring plan of the CBE, it will be important to fully implement these
initiatives. Regarding the NBE, the staff welcomes the commencement of the restructuring
plan, but there is a need to work towards increasing the operational autonomy of the NBE,
and the staff would urge the authorities to consider the recommendations of the consultants
aimed at strengthening the NBE’s independence. The staff also urges the authorities to open
up more of the financial sector to the private sector, including by allowing foreign bank
entry.
49.
Data provision to the Fund remains adequate for surveillance purposes, and the staff
welcomes the development of a comprehensive Medium-Term National Statistical Plan and
efforts to improve data on poverty and social indicators.
50.
The staff recommends that the final review under the PRGF be completed. It is
proposed that the next Article IV consultation with Ethiopia be held within 24 months,
subject to the provisions of Decision No. 127 94–(02/76) on Article IV consultation cycles,
as amended.

Gross domestic product

Sources: Ethiopian authorities; and Fund staff estimates and projections.
1/ Fiscal year ending July 7.
2/ The revised projection is based on current policies and identified financing. The medium-term baseline reflects staff-recommended adjustment based on identified financing consistent with the
inflation target and sustainable public debt.
3/ Excluding special programs (demobilization and reconstruction).
4/ Demobilization and reconstruction.
5/ Figures for external financing and grants are provided by donors, and differ in some cases from government estimates.
6/ External interest payments are presented after traditional debt relief up to 2003/04, but following the completion point in 2003/04 are presented after HIPC Initiative relief starting in 2004/05.
HIPC Initiative relief below the line becomes zero beginning in 2004/05 following the completion point. The authorities after 2003/04 continue to provide figures gross of debt relief.
7/ Unidentified financing is assumed to be filled from above the line, either as additional grant financing or through measures to be identified.
8/ In cases of unidentified financing, the balance excluding grants is calculated assuming that additional measures are taken to close the gap, rather than higher grants.

Unidentified financing or measures to be identified 7/
Overall balance
Including grants
Excluding grants 8/
Financing

Sources: Ethiopian authorities; and Fund staff estimates and projections.
1/ Fiscal year ending July 7.
2/ The revised projection is based on current policies and identified financing. The medium-term baseline reflects staff recommended adjustment based on identified financing consistent with the
inflation target and sustainable public debt.
3/ Excluding special programs (demobilization and reconstruction).
4/ Demobilization and reconstruction.
5/ Figures for external financing and grants are provided by donors, and differ in some cases from government estimates.
6/ External interest payments are presented after traditional debt relief up to 2003/04, but following the completion point in 2003/04 are presented after HIPC Initiative relief starting in 2004/05.
HIPC Initiative relief below the line becomes zero beginning in 2004/05 following the completion point. The authorities after 2003/04 continue to provide figures gross of debt relief.
7/ Unidentified financing is assumed to be filled from above the line, either as additional grant financing or through measures to be identified.
8/ In cases of unidentified financing, the balance excluding grants is calculated assuming that additional measures are taken to close the gap, rather than higher grants.

APPENDIX I

August 12, 2004
Mr. Rodrigo de Rato
Managing Director
International Monetary Fund
Washington, D.C. 20431
Dear Mr. de Rato:
In accordance with the provisions of the three-year arrangement (approved on March 22,
2001), under the Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility (PRGF), the Government of
Ethiopia, in cooperation with staff of the IMF, has evaluated the implementation of the third
annual program (July 8, 2003–July 7, 2004); performance is to be measured through endMarch 2004. Following the completion of the sixth review under the PRGF arrangement by
the Executive Board, the government requests the seventh disbursement in an amount
equivalent to SDR 10.429 million under the arrangement.
In 2003/04, real GDP is provisionally estimated to have increased by 11.6 percent, mainly
reflecting a sharp recovery in agricultural output, which grew by 18.9 percent. Inflation is
estimated to have fallen to 12.1 percent in the 12 months to April 2004. All the quantitative
performance criteria for end-March 2004 and the structural performance criteria for end-June
2004 have been met (Tables 1 and 2), and we believe that the current stance of
macroeconomic policies remains fully consistent with achieving all the quantitative and
structural benchmarks for end-June 2004. We will be reporting to you on the performance
relating to the benchmarks for April–June of fiscal year 2003/04 by end-August, 2004.
The government wishes in particular to stress that it is continuing in its efforts to maintain
budget discipline, to develop a public debt strategy which will set public debt on to a
sustainable path, and to continue to reorient public spending in favor of poverty-related
expenditures as envisaged in the PRSP.
The government believes that its policies are adequate to achieve the objectives of its
program, but it will take any further measures that may become appropriate for this purpose.
Ethiopia will consult with the Fund on the adoption of these measures, and in advance of
revisions to its policies, in accordance with the Fund’s policies on such consultation.
Sincerely yours,
/s/
Sufian Ahmed
Minister of Finance and
Economic Development

VIII. Safeguards Assessment
Under the Fund’s safeguards assessment policy, the National Bank of Ethiopia (NBE) is
subject to a full safeguards assessment with respect to the Poverty Reduction and Growth
Facility arrangement approved on March 22, 2001, which is scheduled to expire on July 31,
2004. An off-site safeguards assessment of the NBE was completed on May 4, 2001. The
assessment concluded that high risks may exist in financial reporting and in the system of
internal controls and recommended an on-site assessment. The on-site assessment was
completed on September 12, 2001. The staff’s findings and recommendations are reported in
16
17

NPV terms at the decision point under the enhanced framework.

Under the enhanced framework, an additional disbursement is made at the completion
point corresponding to interest income earned on the amount committed at the decision point,
but not disbursed during the interim period.

- 46 -

APPENDIX II

Appendix V of Country Report No. 02/68. The NBE is implementing the outstanding issues
of recommendations under the safeguards assessment.
IX.

Exchange Rate Arrangement

Effective October 24, 2001, NBE terminated the weekly wholesale foreign exchange
auctions for the birr (Br) and moved all foreign exchange operations to the interbank market.
The current exchange rate regime is classified as managed floating. The transaction-weighted
average interbank market exchange rate on May 31, 2004 was Br 8.633 = US$1.
In March 2001, the authorities eliminated previously existing restrictions on the purchase of
foreign exchange for holiday travel and education purposes. Since then, exporters have been
allowed to retain 10 percent of their export proceeds in foreign exchange for an indefinite
period. The rest may be retained for a period of 28 days, after which it has to be converted
into local currency by the customer’s bank using the prevailing transaction rate, unless an
exporter spends it on eligible imports within 28 days. The multiple currency practice that
might have arisen from the NBE’s weekly foreign exchange auction was lifted with the
replacement of the auction by the interbank foreign exchange market. Remaining current
account exchange restrictions relate to (a) the tax certification requirement for repatriation of
investment income; (b) restrictions on repayment of legally entered into external loans and
supplies and foreign partner’s credits; (c) rules for issuance of import permits; and (d) the
requirement to provide a clearance certificate from NBE to obtain import permits. These
restrictions are inconsistent with Article VIII, Section 2(a) of the IMF’s Articles of
Agreement.
X.

Article IV Consultation

Ethiopia is on the 24-month cycle for members with Fund arrangements in accordance with
the provisions of the decision on consultation cycles approved on July 15, 2002. The
Executive Board concluded the last Article IV consultation on September 23, 2002,
concurrently with the completion of the third review under the second annual PRGFsupported program (Country Report No. 02/220).

APPENDIX III

Ethiopia: Relations with the World Bank18
(As of July 2004)
A.

Partnership in Ethiopia’s Development Strategy

1.
In July 2002, the government of Ethiopia finalized its full Poverty Reduction Strategy
Paper (PRSP), known as the Sustainable Development and Poverty Reduction Program
(SDPRP). This was discussed in September 2002 by the Boards of the World Bank and the
Fund, along with a Joint Staff Assessment of the SDPRP strategy. The first Annual Progress
Report (APR) on SDPRP implementation was finalized by the Government in December
2003. The second Annual Progress Report is expected to be presented in December 2004,
with an interim APR to be shared by Government in August 2004.
2.
The IMF has taken the lead in helping Ethiopia maintain macroeconomic stability,
under a three year Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility (PRGF) arrangement approved in
March 2001. The PRGF addresses issues related to fiscal consolidation and structural
reforms that are key to maintaining macroeconomic stability and fostering growth. The
PRGF’s structural conditionality has focused on the following areas: the financial sector,
budget consolidation and reconciliation, and public expenditure management.
3.
The Bank leads the policy dialogue on structural reforms relevant to economic growth
and poverty reduction, including rural development, infrastructure, private sector
development (PSD), human development, governance, and vulnerability. The Bank and
Fund share joint responsibility in supporting financial sector, taxation, decentralization, and
public expenditure reforms.
B.

Key Areas of Common Interest to Bank and Fund

4.
Preparation and Implementation of the PRSP. The World Bank and the IMF
collaborated in providing support to the government in the preparation of the PRSP,
including preparing joint comments on an early draft of the PRSP and the Joint Staff
Assessment. The Bank and the IMF also collaborated on the preparation of the Joint Staff
Assessment of the first APR on SDPRP implementation.
5.
Through lending and analytical work, the Bank and the Fund jointly support
implementation of the SDPRP’s policy reforms, including the following main areas:
6.
Macroeconomic policy, PSD, and the financial sector. There is close cooperation
between the World Bank and the IMF in discussing macroeconomic policy with the
government. Complementing the PRGF’s focus on macroeconomic issues, one of the key
focus areas of the Bank’s Poverty Reduction Support Credit (PRSC) series is structural
18

Prepared by staff of the World Bank.

- 49 -

APPENDIX III

policy reforms to support pro-poor growth, and the Fund has joined in PRSC dialogue on the
financial sector. Staff of the Fund and Bank are working jointly on a Pilot Case Study on
Public Investment and Fiscal Policy that will examine the fiscal implications of state
ownership of public enterprises as an input into the privatization program.
7.
Public sector reforms. The Bank and Fund have been supporting the Government’s
movement towards decentralization with a view to improving the working of the civil service
and improving service delivery at the local level, particularly in terms of improving the
incentives for regional and local level performance in the formula for sub-national transfers
of public resources. In addition to support to decentralization, the Bank is also providing
assistance for civil service reform, tax and customs administration reform, legal and judicial
reforms and urban management, through the Public Sector Capacity Building Project
(PSCAP, $100 m.), approved by the Board of the World Bank on May 11, 2004.
8.
Public expenditure management. The Fund has been an active participant in Bankcoordinated annual public expenditure reviews (PERs), which have provided an objective
analysis of the government’s public expenditure strategy, as well as an opportunity to study
issues in public finance management of common interest and concern. The 2001 PER was
the first review of public expenditure at the regional level. The 2002 PER focused on (a)
spending in the social sectors; and (b) an update on overall spending patterns, budget systems
issues, and fiscal decentralization developments. In the context of HIPC, the government,
IDA and the IMF have been tracking the use of savings arising from HIPC interim assistance.
9.
Going forward, the government has confirmed its commitment to introduce a Joint
Budget and Aid Review (JBAR) as a key element of the ongoing planning and budget cycle.
This instrument is intended to replace the series of PERs that had traditionally been
undertaken by the World Bank which, together with the proposed FAs (see below), assume
larger importance in the context of decentralization and the Bank and other donors’ shift in
development assistance to programmatic/budget support. The JBAR’s primary objective is
to review budget allocations – at the sectoral, sub-sectoral, regional and local levels – in
terms of the links to national growth, poverty and human development outcomes as laid out
in the SDPRP. More specifically, the objectives of the JBAR would be to: improve
information and predictability on expected resource flows to sector agencies and lower levels
of government; give decision-makers a better sense of where money is going, and that money
is being spent on intended uses; and provide better information on overall fiscal aggregates
and how this is financed, to better inform macro-level discussions.
10. Fiduciary assessments. MOFED has also agreed with DBS donors and the Bank that a
joint fiduciary assessment—the first in a series of annual Fiduciary Assessments (FAs)—will
be carried out as a key input into the direct budget support decision cycle. FAs are intended
to consolidate and replace the varied reviews of expenditure management systems in
Ethiopia, including the aspects of the PER related to institutional and inter-governmental
fiscal design issues, as well as the CFAA and CPAR. The Bank is expected to work closely
with AFRITAC on the FAs.

11. Millennium Development Goals. The Bank and Fund, together with the U.N.
Millennium Project, are supporting the Government in undertaking a needs assessment to
estimate the cost of the investments needed to put Ethiopia on a path to meet the MDGs, and
develop a strategy to finance these costs.
12. Debt sustainability analysis and the Enhanced HIPC Initiative. The Boards of the
Bank and the Fund agreed on April 20, 2004 that Ethiopia had taken the necessary steps to
reach its HIPC completion point. In addition to making irrevocable the $1.3 billion of NPV
debt relief envisaged at Decision Point in November 2001, the Boards approved the toppingup of debt relief by an additional $0.7 billion in NPV terms. The exceptional additional
topping up assistance was granted on account of exogenous factors—particularly changes in
the discount rate and exchange rate since the decision point—that had fundamentally
changed Ethiopia's economic circumstances and thereby adversely affected its debt
sustainability. In preparation for the Board discussions, Bank and Fund staff jointly
monitored progress by the Government toward meeting the HIPC triggers necessary to reach
Completion Point. The World Bank and the Fund also jointly updated the debt sustainability
analysis (DSA) for Ethiopia prior to Completion Point. Post-HIPC, the Bank and Fund are
working together to support Government in developing a debt management strategy.
13. Statistical issues. Both institutions have been providing technical assistance to the
government of Ethiopia on the compilation of data and statistics, with the Fund focusing on
the compilation of macroeconomic statistics and the Bank supporting the improvement of
data on poverty and social indicators, and on the monitoring of output and outcomes of
poverty reduction programs.
C.

Bank Group Strategy

14. The FY03-FY05 Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) for Ethiopia supports
implementation of the SDPRP, thereby assisting the country’s efforts to reduce poverty and
achieve the MDGs. The CAS was developed with the benefit of an extensive consultation
process, and focused on three key pillars of the SDPRP: pro-poor growth (urban and rural);
institutional development and capacity building; and reducing vulnerability. The CAS also
proposed a shift away from traditional project-based lending toward increased programmatic
approaches such as Poverty Reduction Support Credits (PRSCs), supported by larger
investments in analytical work. Since the writing of the CAS, the Government has developed
a Food Security Program in collaboration with the Bank and donors that aims to eliminate
hunger and break the cycle of vulnerability to shocks such as drought. The Bank is
supporting the program through a broad range of interventions—IDA grants and credits,
technical assistance, and analytical work.
15. The CAS envisaged new Bank commitments of around US$1.5 billion in the base case,
with up to 40 percent provided in grants under IDA13. However, due to debt sustainability
concerns arising from exogenous shocks, the Bank halted all new lending until the Boards of
the Bank and Fund approved the ‘topping-up’ of debt relief by $0.7 billion in April 2004. As
a consequence of the halt of lending, IDA commitments in FY03 and FY04 were limited to
nine projects totaling $724 million, of which $361 million was grants. Lending under the

- 51 -

APPENDIX III

CAS has now resumed, though debt sustainability concerns are being taken into
consideration in all future lending to prevent Ethiopia from falling back into a situation
where its debt is again unsustainable. A CAS progress report will be prepared by the Bank in
early FY05.
16. At the end of FY04, Ethiopia’s portfolio of IDA operations comprised 20 active
projects, with total net commitments of $1,956 million and an undisbursed balance of $947
million. Total disbursements to Ethiopia increased substantially to $422 million (of which
$179 million of grants) in FY04 as compared to $362 million (with no grants) in FY03.

APPENDIX IV

Ethiopia: Statistical Issues
General
51.
Recognizing the importance of accurate and timely data, not only for macroeconomic
policy formulation, but also for monitoring implementation of Ethiopia’s PRSP, and for
assessing progress with the implementation of the PRSP, the authorities have developed a
comprehensive Medium-Term National Statistical Program. The program will be
implemented over a period of five years, and aims at addressing data deficiencies in each of
the major socio-economic sectors. The Medium-Term National Statistical Plan has been
identified as an essential element of the authorities’ efforts to strengthen the Monitoring and
Evaluation System for implementation of Ethiopia’s PRSP. Ethiopia is a participant in the
General Data Dissemination System (GDDS) and its metadata are posted on the Fund’s
Dissemination Standards Bulletin Board (DSBB). Ethiopia also participates in the GDDS
project for Anglophone Africa and had been receiving technical assistance in the fiscal and
external sectors under the project.
Real sector
52.
The authorities have improved the timeliness and coverage of national accounts,
economic surveys, and prices since 1993. Preliminary national accounts are available through
2002/03 (July 8-July 7). A new series of GDP estimates, updating the base year from
1980/81 to 1999/2000, is under construction and is expected to be released shortly.
Additionally, with technical assistance from AFRITAC East, the authorities have been
developing an Establishment Census, the objective of which is to collect data on a range of
economic indicators (e.g. employment, capital stock, inputs and outputs) for all business
establishments in the country. The first census was conducted during March 2004. Following
the successful completion of the program to amend the methodological framework of the
consumer price index, the Ethiopian authorities are currently working on the establishment of
a production price index with technical assistance from AFRITAC East. Survey focused on
the development of a set of indicators of economic activity are expected to commence in
2004/05.
Public finances
53.
Monthly federal government accounts are reported with a six- to eight-week lag.
Under the three-year PRGF arrangement, progress was made in 2002/03 in improving the
quality and coverage of reporting on the consolidated general government. The consolidation
of federal and regional budgets, inclusive of all extrabudgetary funds and accounts, for the
past year and the budget year was a performance criterion under the Third Annual Program
of the PRGF, as well as a trigger for reaching the completion point under the HIPC Initiative.
However, with the ongoing decentralization of fiscal powers to woredas (districts), ensuring

- 53 -

APPENDIX IV

the integrity of the consolidated budget reporting will be an ongoing task. Progress was also
made in 2002/03 in eliminating discrepancies between data on the domestic and foreign
financing of the budget deficit and the monetary accounts. With the assistance of an STA
mission which visited Addis Ababa in August 2003, the joint reconciliation committee,
composed of the Ministry of Finance and Economic Development (MOFED) and the
National Bank of Ethiopia (NBE), established a short-term work program to achieve the
reconciliation of provisional quarterly fiscal and monetary data for 2001/02 and 2002/03.
This action was also a performance criterion under the Third Annual Program of the PRGF
and trigger for the completion point under the HIPC Initiative. The second assessment of the
public expenditure management systems in Ethiopia which was conducted by FAD in the
first quarter of 2004 identified a lack of timely fiscal reporting as a key concern, particularly
as it hampers the management of fiscal policy within the year. A detailed action plan for
improving the public expenditure management system has been developed.
Monetary accounts
3.
The monetary survey is reported with a six-week lag. An STA technical assistance
mission in January-February 2004 found that the quality of Ethiopia’s monetary and financial
statistics is compromised by various methodological problems. The mission recommended
correcting a number of instances of misclassification of accounting data, and commenced the
development of an Integrated Monetary Database for Ethiopia. A follow-up mission is
expected to complete the latter project.
Balance of payments
4.
Balance of payments data still require improvements in the coverage, valuation,
timing, and classification of transactions. The authorities have begun working toward the
adoption of the fifth edition of the Balance of Payments Manual, but problems persist. In
particular, key surveys recommended by the 1995 STA mission for the collection of basic
data were not carried out until early 1999/2000. Import data still rely primarily on exchange
control data, even though the quality of that data has worsened in the wake of the exchange
system liberalization in 1998. The use of customs records to generate trade data has begun
with the operationalization of the Automated System for Customs Data (ASYCUDA) at
major customs stations in February 1999, which should improve the timeliness and coverage
of trade statistics. An export unit value index is available (with a two-year delay), but no
import unit value index is produced. Data on official and private transfers and private capital
flows are also weak. The NBE, in collaboration with the Ethiopia Investment Authority and
other government agencies, is preparing a database on foreign direct investment, including a
reporting system for tracking new investment. The January 2002 multisector mission
recommended methods for improving the quality of the data on tourism, insurance, foreign
direct investment, private transfers, and private debt. A follow-up mission was conducted in
April-May 2004 in the context of the General Data Dissemination project for Anglophone
Africa.

- 54 -

APPENDIX IV

Social indicators
5.
Data on poverty exist in the form of several household surveys regularly conducted
by the Central Statistical Authority (CSA).19 In addition, the World Bank has produced
reports on Education and Health Sector Development Programs, as well as the Poverty and
Policies for the New Millennium Report (1999), that contain data on the poverty situation in
Ethiopia. On the basis of this information, the government, with assistance from the World
Bank, has constructed welfare indicators for measuring poverty reduction, including income
and expenditure per capita, income inequality, literacy, malnutrition, and infant/child
mortality measures. For 2003/04, a Participatory Poverty Assessment will be conducted with
support from the World Bank. For 2004/04, the authorities plan to conduct a Household
Income, Consumption and Expenditure Survey, as well as a Welfare Monitoring Survey.
Adequate data do not exist on prevalence rates of HIV/AIDS, especially among the rural
population, and it is not clear whether there is sufficient monitoring of food consumption
among people living in drought-prone areas. The Welfare Monitoring Survey, planned for
2004/05, is expected to include a number of indicators relating to HIV/AIDS.

19

Examples of existing surveys include the Household Income, Consumption, and
Expenditure Survey (1995/96 and 1999/2000) and the Welfare Monitoring Survey (1996,
1997, 1998, and 1999). Additional household and consumption surveys were carried out by
the University of Addis Ababa in collaboration with Oxford University.

APPENDIX VI

Authorities’ Views on the Ex-Post Assessment

54.
The authorities welcomed the Ex Post Assessment as providing an opportunity
to revisit their performance over the last decade and to enhance their future policies.
They considered that Ethiopia had benefited from Fund-supported programs and the dialogue
with the Fund, which had made a significant difference to their policies and kept them “on
their toes.” Relations under the current PRGF have been particularly close.
The authorities expressed four general concerns with the report.20
•

The report showed a lack of new thinking by the Fund. It still applied the “old
paradigm” of the “Washington consensus.” The Fund should be more mindful of
different routes to development and that the authorities have their own path. In
particular, there needs to be more awareness of sequencing issues and less axiomatic
assumption that liberalization is always the answer. For example, the authorities
mentioned that: although the fertilizer market was controlled, prices were lower than
in other countries; financial sector liberalization, while desirable in principle, needs a
functioning money market first (which is not present); and the Fund should recognize
that the authorities have a different, and theoretically and practically valid, view on
capital account liberalization.

•

The report should better represent the basis for the authorities’ policy
differences with the Fund. These differences should be presented as being based on
the results of their own concrete analysis and developmental strategy rather than due
to an inherent gradualist approach or suspicion of markets.

•

The report should be more nuanced and specific. In particular, more credit should
be given to recent reforms undertaken by the authorities in many areas, for example,
of the civil service, land security, and revenue administration.

•

The discussion of the ESAF breakdown should better represent the authorities’
position. They considered that as they had met the backward-looking conditionality,
the reviews should have been completed and that it was unreasonable for the Fund to
require agreement on the following year’s budget.

The authorities had the following views on the implications for any future arrangement:

20

The authorities also provided detailed specific comments, which have been largely incorporated.

- 57 -

APPENDIX V

•

While they would prefer a high-access arrangement, Fund financial support was
not key. They considered that their performance warranted high-access, but pointed
out that Fund financing was relatively minor and the key benefits of Fund-supported
programs were the policy framework and the seal of approval. They also did not
envisage having major balance of payments needs.

•

While they agreed with the need for future arrangements to focus on private
sector development, they questioned whether financial sector reform should be a
priority. They also noted that agricultural and land reforms were already afoot.

•

The focus on external debt sustainability should be on expanding exports rather
than constraining borrowing. Similarly, on domestic debt, the burden on the
budget was low (due to low real interest rates) and more revenue will be
generated in the future.

Statement by the IMF Staff Representative
September 13, 2004
This statement updates the staff report to reflect information that has become available since
its issuance (August 19, 2004). The new information does not change the thrust of the staff
appraisal.
Average annual inflation declined from 15.1 percent in 2002/03 (July-June) to 9.0 percent in
2003/04, mostly on account of a slow-down in the pace of food price increases following the
recovery of food production from the droughts of 2001/02 and 2002/03. Average annual food
inflation declined from 24.8 percent in 2002/03 to 11.8 percent in 2003/04; nonfood inflation,
however, rose from 1.6 percent to 4.3 percent over the same period. Inflation slowed further in
July 2004, with the year-on-year rate of increase declining to 2.3 percent, from 2.9 percent in
June. Nonfood inflation, however, continued to rise; the year-on-year rate of increase
accelerating to 6.0 percent in July 2004 from 5.8 percent in June.
Broad money growth continued to rise throughout 2003/04, and amounted to 15.2 percent in
June 2004 when compared with June 2003. As a proportion of the stock of broad money at
end-June 2003, net foreign assets increased by 6.5 percent, while net domestic assets rose by
8.7 percent. The increase in net claims on the government was 6.5 percent, and that of claims
on the nongovernment sector 3.2 percent of the beginning period stock of broad money.
The projected number of people requiring food aid during 2004 was revised upward in
August 2004 from 7.1 million people to 7.8 million people based on an assessment of the short
rainy season. The total food aid requirements were revised upward from 871,000 metric tons
to 1.2 million metric tons; of the total required aid, 907,000 metric tons (76 percent) has
already been pledged by donor agencies. In the six months to end June 2004, a total of
386,000 metric tons of food aid were distributed.

Press Release No. 04/194
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
September 13, 2004

International Monetary Fund
Washington, D.C. 20431 USA

IMF Completes Sixth Review Under Ethiopia's Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility
Arrangement
The Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) has completed the sixth and final
review of Ethiopia's performance under an SDR 100.28 million (about US$147 million)
Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility (PRGF) arrangement (see Press Release No. 01/11 and
News Brief No.02/23). This decision enables Ethiopia to receive the final disbursement of
SDR 10.4 (about US$15 million).
After the Executive Board's discussion on Ethiopia, Mr. Takatoshi Kato, Deputy Managing
Director and Acting Chair, issued the following statement:
“Ethiopia’s performance under the three-year PRGF-supported program has been good. Real
GDP growth has rebounded strongly, price stability has been maintained, and progress has been
made with key structural reforms. However, Ethiopia remains highly vulnerable to external
shocks, notably drought and export prices, while poverty indicators continue to be among the
highest in the world.
“The main challenges going forward are to achieve faster growth and the Millennium
Development Goals (MDGs), to increase the economy’s resilience to shocks, and to ensure debt
sustainability. This will require both higher levels of external aid and improvements in Ethiopia’s
capacity to absorb and use such assistance more effectively. Continued prudent macroeconomic
policies and more ambitious structural reforms in key areas, especially in the agricultural, fiscal,
and financial sectors, will be essential for reaching these objectives.
“Fiscal policy is expected to continue to focus on strengthening expenditure management and
enhancing revenues, while containing inflationary domestic financing and reducing the public
debt burden. Improving public expenditure management also remains a critical priority for the
government, especially for bolstering the capacity of local governments, given their new
expenditure mandates following fiscal decentralization.
“A significant increase in external assistance to Ethiopia would need to be largely in the form of
grants if public debt sustainability is to be maintained. The authorities are developing a

-2-

comprehensive and prudent public debt management strategy to clarify the rules for containing
future domestic and external borrowing to sustainable levels. The plans to develop their own
fiscal scenarios aimed at achieving the MDGs are also welcome. In this context, it will be
important to work with realistic assumptions, identify challenges early, and mitigate any
potential adverse effects on the broader macroeconomic framework.
“Monetary and exchange rate policies will continue to focus on achieving the inflation and
international reserve targets. Safeguarding external competitiveness requires implementing
structural reforms that improve productivity and efficiency, while the exchange rate should be
fully market-determined.
“In order to lay firm foundations for achieving a significant and sustained increase in long-term
growth, it is essential to press ahead with structural reforms, focusing on agriculture, food
security, capacity building, export promotion, privatization, and strengthening the legal and
regulatory framework. Attention will also need to be paid to strengthening the financial sector
and promoting competition within that sector. In this regard, full implementation of the
restructuring plan for the Commercial Bank of Ethiopia and enhancement of the central bank’s
independence and its supervisory capacity remain high priorities,” Mr. Kato said.
The PRGF is the IMF's concessional facility for qualifying low-income countries. The purpose
of the PRGF is to support programs to strengthen substantially and in a sustainable manner a
country's balance of payments position and to foster durable growth, leading to higher living
standards and a reduction in poverty. PRGF-supported programs are based on country-owned
poverty reduction strategies adopted in a participatory process involving civil society and
development partners and articulated in a Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP). PRGF loans
carry an annual interest rate of 0.5 percent and are repayable over 10 years with a 5½-year grace
period.

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2004 Article IV Consultation with
Ethiopia
On September 13, 2004, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF)
concluded the Article IV consultation with Ethiopia and completed the final review under
the Poverty Reduction Groth Facility (PRGF) Arrangement.1
Background
The Ethiopian authorities have been implementing wide-ranging structural reforms and
pursuing prudent macroeconomic polices. However, Ethiopia continues to face political
uncertainties, which are mainly related to the unresolved dispute with Eritrea on
boundary demarcation. The country ranks toward the bottom (170 out of 177 countries)
in the 2004 Human Development Index ranking, an assessment combining life
expectancy, adult literacy, primary school enrollment, and per capita income. The
Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP) indicates that the poverty headcount index
was 44.2 percent in 1999/00 for the country as a whole, down from 45.5 percent in
1995/96.
Ethiopia’s real GDP growth rebounded strongly by 11.6 percent during 2003/04, as
agricultural production recovered fully from the drought-affected levels of 2001/02–
2002/03. The average annual consumer price inflation rate has fallen from 15.1 percent
in 2002/03 to about 9.6 percent in 2003/04. Although the exchange rate vis-à-vis the
U.S. dollar has remained highly stable through 2003/04, the exchange rate has
depreciated in nominal and real effective terms (by about 8 percent and 5 percent,
respectively through end-March 2004). This policy has allowed the National Bank of

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies.
On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion
by the Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as
Chairman of the Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is
transmitted to the country's authorities.

Ethiopia (NBE) to build up its net foreign assets and establish a stronger reserve
cushion for coping with future exogenous shocks.
Based on updated estimates, in 2003/04 the fiscal deficit (including grants) is likely to be
about 4.8 percent of GDP. In nominal terms, revenue surpassed the program target
because of strong indirect tax receipts stemming from buoyant import growth and
improved customs administration, which more than offset lower-than-projected direct
taxes that reflected weak corporate profits following the drought of 2001/02. Moreover,
donors provided more external grants and less project loans, given the vulnerable debt
situation. The external current account deficit (including grants) is estimated to narrow to
4 percent in 2003/04.
Progress has been made in implementing structural reforms that focused on public
sector management, public expenditure policy, and the commencement of the
implementation of restructuring plans for the Commercial Bank of Ethiopia (CBE) and
the NBE. The first annual progress report of the poverty reduction strategy paper was
discussed by the IMF and World Bank Boards in February 2004, and Ethiopia reached
the completion point under the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) Initiative in
April 2004.
Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors welcomed the strong rebound of economic activity in 2003/04
despite the recent drought and the continued border conflict. Price stability has been
maintained, the international reserve position has strengthened, and progress has been
made with key structural reforms, notably in the fiscal and agricultural sectors. These
achievements will help lay the foundation for sustaining higher growth over the medium
term.
Directors observed, however, that Ethiopia remains highly vulnerable to external shocks,
and poverty indicators continue to be among the highest in the world. Sustaining faster
growth and making progress toward the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), while
maintaining debt sustainability, will require both stronger and broader structural reforms
and stepped-up donor support. Directors underscored, in this regard, the importance of
improving Ethiopia’s capacity to absorb and use donor assistance more effectively, a
peaceful resolution of the border dispute with Eritrea, and the continued reorientation of
public resources to poverty-related expenditures.
Directors agreed that fiscal policy should continue to focus on strengthening expenditure
management and enhancing revenues, while containing domestic financing and
reducing the public debt burden. While welcoming the projected rise in social spending
in the 2004/05 budget, they expressed concern about the increase in military
expenditure and the higher level of domestic borrowing needed to finance the budget,
which complicates efforts to reduce inflation and crowds out credit to the private sector.
Directors therefore urged the authorities to consider additional fiscal measures,
including cuts in non-priority outlays. They stressed that implementation of the Food
Security Program should be supported by steps to strengthen the capacity of local

-3-

governments to absorb the substantially higher federal transfers. The authorities should
also seek additional donor grants to finance the program; this could be facilitated by
timely external audits of the achieved outcomes.
Directors welcomed the progress that has been achieved in fiscal reforms. They
emphasized that improving public expenditure management remains a critical priority,
particularly in view of the need to strengthen the capacity of local governments following
fiscal decentralization. At the same time, efforts should continue to consolidate and
report the general government accounts in a timely manner to enhance fiscal
transparency and accountability. Directors also urged the authorities to consolidate the
gains made in improving tax and customs administration, and to review the VAT refund
mechanism along with other audit and enforcement guidelines, aimed at creating a tax
environment that is more conducive to private sector investment.
Directors encouraged the authorities to develop a comprehensive, prudent public debt
management strategy, with clear rules for containing future domestic and external
borrowing, and limiting borrowing to highly concessional loans and, preferably, grants to
keep the public debt at sustainable levels. Consistent with any scenario involving a
significant increase in external assistance, the authorities’ medium-term fiscal framework
needs to involve a rebalancing of expenditure to recurrent items, given large gaps in the
required number of teachers and medical personnel. Directors welcomed the authorities’
plan to develop their own fiscal scenarios for MDG purposes. They noted, however, that
the “double aid” scenario, which appears ambitious, requires a much stronger policy
effort on the part of the authorities to materialize. In any event, continued close
consultation with the Fund and donors will be crucial, to identify the challenges early and
mitigate any potential adverse effects on the broader macroeconomic framework arising
from a substantial scaling-up of aid inflows.
Directors stressed that monetary and exchange rate policies need to focus on achieving
the inflation and international reserve targets. To this end, and in the present
environment of increased inflationary pressures, they urged the authorities to remain
prudent and adopt more cautious targets for the expansion of money and credit to the
government. They also suggested that market-based instruments be developed to
enhance the central bank’s liquidity management capacity. Directors welcomed the
authorities’ commitment to allow the exchange rate to be fully market-determined, with
interventions being limited to smoothing fluctuations. In this context, the authorities were
encouraged to safeguard external competitiveness through structural reforms that
improve productivity and efficiency. Measures to further liberalize foreign trade,
eliminate remaining exchange restrictions, and streamline customs procedures would
support these objectives.
Directors urged the authorities to expedite the implementation of the structural reform
agenda in support of rural and private sector development. Particular emphasis should
continue to be placed on agricultural productivity, capacity building, and privatization. In
the financial sector, Directors stressed that it will be important to fully implement the
restructuring plans for the state-owned banks, particularly for the Commercial Bank of
Ethiopia. They commended the authorities for the progress in implementing safeguards

-4-

recommendations, strengthening bank supervision, and restructuring the National Bank
of Ethiopia, and urged further consideration of measures to increase its operational
autonomy. Directors also encouraged the authorities to accelerate financial reform
aimed at increasing competition and financial intermediation, as well as strengthening
the soundness of domestic banks. Consideration should be given to opening up more of
the financial sector to the private sector, including by allowing foreign bank entry.
Directors welcomed the opportunity to review Ethiopia’s performance under Fund
supported programs since 1992. They broadly concurred with the conclusions of the ex
post assessment of long-term Fund engagement with Ethiopia, and with the strategy for
future Fund involvement. Directors welcomed in particular the authorities’ strong
ownership of programs, which had translated directly into action. They noted with
concern, however, that Ethiopia’s debt sustainability remain precarious even after three
successive Fund-supported programs and the HIPC completion point, and that fiscal
and external deficits remain large. Going forward, Directors emphasized the importance
of realistic projections for real growth, government revenues, and foreign grants in
developing macroeconomic programs; prudent debt management; more ambitious
structural reforms; and programs that explicitly incorporate policies to help cope with
exogenous shocks. They also highlighted the need to translate past lessons into better
program design and future action, as well as to learn from the successful experiences of
similar countries. In addition, improved cooperation and coordination with the World
Bank and donors is critical to ensuring steady aid flows. Directors noted that the Fund
continues to have an important role to play in providing technical assistance to
strengthen capacity in the priority areas identified in the assessment.
