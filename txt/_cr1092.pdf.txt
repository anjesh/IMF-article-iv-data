St. Lucia: Staff Report for the 2010 Article IV Consultation
Prepared by the Western Hemisphere Department
(In consultation with other Departments)
Approved by Rodrigo Valdés (WHD) and Michele Shannon (SPR)

Context. Reflecting a sharp fall in tourist arrivals and subdued FDI-financed construction activity, the
economy contracted by 5.2 percent in 2009. The outlook for 2010 points to a slow, fragile recovery,
dependent on tourism demand in the USA and Europe.
Discussions. Discussions were held in Castries during February 8–18, 2010. The staff team
comprised Messrs. Schipke (Head), Nassar, Perrelli, Samuel (all WHD), and Tareq (FAD). The team
met with Prime Minister and Minister of Finance the Honorable Stephenson King, Leader of the
Opposition Dr. Kenny Anthony, Permanent Secretary of the Ministry of Finance Isaac Anthony, and
senior government officials, trade union representatives, as well as representatives of the private
sector. Senior staff of the ECCB and a representative of the CDB attended key meetings.
Key Issues. An incipient economic recovery based on a rebound in the tourism sector is underway,
but is subject to significant downside risks. After a large fiscal impulse in 2009, which aimed at
minimizing the adverse impact of the recession on employment, the adoption of a credible fiscal
framework to ensure debt sustainability is paramount. Recent financial sector difficulties in the
Caribbean call for stronger financial sector regulation and supervision. The resolution of the failed
CL Financial Group requires close monitoring to avoid regional spillovers and limit the fiscal cost.
Fund Relations. St. Lucia has accepted the obligations of Article VIII, Sections 2, 3 and 4, and
maintains an exchange rate system free of restrictions on the making of payments and transfers for
current international transactions. The Executive Board approved a request for a RAC-ESF on
July 27, 2009 of an amount equivalent to SDR 6.89 million (45 percent of quota). The last Article IV
Consultation was concluded on July 30, 2008. The staff report and summing up of the Executive
Directors’ discussions and policy recommendations are available at:

I. Economic Context
1. Following a period of moderate
economic growth, St. Lucia has been
severely impacted by the global downturn.
Real GDP contracted sharply in 2009 after
expanding on average by about 3 percent
during the previous 5 years, when tourism
became a more prominent sector and resulted
in FDI-related construction. The recession in
the United States and Europe has contributed
to lower tourism arrivals, FDI inflows, and
remittances. Fiscal revenue declined reflecting
the cyclical downturn and a limited temporary
tax relief to the tourism sector. As a result of a
decline in FDI-related imports, the external
current account improved from very high
deficits. At the same time, the failure of the
CL Financial Group in Trinidad and Tobago,
with extensive operations in the ECCU
region—including St. Lucia—has highlighted
the vulnerabilities of the financial system.
2. The Fund’s Executive Board approved
a disbursement under the Rapid-Access
Component of the Fund’s Exogenous
Shocks Facility in July, 2009. The financial
assistance, equivalent to SDR 6.89 million
(45 percent of quota), helped meet the

immediate foreign exchange needs stemming
from the spillover effects of the global
downturn and financial turmoil, thereby limiting
the decline in external reserves.
3. The authorities face difficult policy
challenges. Policymaking in St. Lucia faces
several constraints, including limited monetary
and fiscal leverage given the common
currency; the relatively high public debt levels;
a likely small fiscal multiplier,1 given the
openness of the economy; and social
protection programs that need to be
strengthened. Prior to the crisis, the
authorities’ policies have been broadly in line
with Fund recommendations.2 However, faced
with weaker than anticipated economic activity
and lower external grants, the authorities
relaxed the fiscal objectives significantly
beyond what was envisaged under the RACESF to minimize the adverse implications for
employment.3 Public debt has increased from
66 to 75 percent between 2008 and 2009.
Going forward, it will therefore be important to
implement a credible fiscal framework to
ensure fiscal and debt sustainability.

II. Recent Economic Developments
Economic activity has weakened, but there are
some indications that an incipient recovery is
underway.
4. Economic activity contracted by
5.2 percent in 2009, given the decline in the
demand for tourism from the main trade
partners (U.S. and U.K.), FDI-financed
construction, and banking and insurance
activity. While in the last quarter of 2009
tourism data have shown a moderate
recovery, the contribution of more stayover

visitors to economic growth is likely to have
been limited, given continued heavy
discounting of hotel room rates and the
airlines’ government support to sustain the

number of flights.4 Inflation is estimated at
about 1 percent at end-2009 (from 7 percent in
2008), and—given the currency board
arrangement—returns to historical levels
(2-3 percent over the medium term).

5. The fiscal position is projected to
deteriorate sharply in FY2009/105 mainly on
account of an increase in non-grantfinanced public expenditure. The central
government primary fiscal balance is expected
to shift from a surplus of 2.2 percent of GDP to
a deficit of 2.5 percent of GDP, while the
overall deficit would rise to about 6.1 percent
of GDP (7.8 percent of GDP including offbudget expenditures related to the
construction and financing of public projects
by the private sector, also known as “designfinance-construct”6) compared to the
authorities’ target of 3 percent of GDP at the
time of the RAC-ESF. On the revenue side,
the cyclical decline was somewhat contained
due to an increase in petroleum product prices
by an average of 20 percent in August 2009
and the adoption of a flexible energy-pricing
regime to avoid future erosion of the fuel

excise. The implementation of a VAT and
other revenue-enhancing measures envisaged
by the authorities in the context of the RACESF, however, has yet to occur. On the
expenditure side, the authorities implemented
a large public works program and advanced a
number of capital projects, resulting in a
projected increase in non-grant capital
expenditure equivalent to 3.1 percent of GDP,
despite delays in the disbursement of grants
and concessional loans.7 The fiscal deficit is
expected to be financed mainly by issuing
securities in the Regional Government
Securities Market (RGSM).
6. The external position has improved,
but the current account deficit remains
somewhat elevated. The external current
account deficit is estimated to have narrowed
by around 10 percent of GDP in 2009 relative
to 2008 despite the decline in tourism.
Stayover arrivals declined by about 6 percent,
but discounting of hotel room rates and lower
spending by tourists resulted in a larger
decline in tourism receipts. Similarly,
remittances are estimated to have declined as
employment opportunities in migrant host
countries remained bleak. A decline in FDIrelated and fuel imports (the latter due to lower
oil prices) is estimated to have offset the
decline in tourism receipts and remittances. At
around 20 percent of GDP the estimated
external current account deficit is close to its
norm8 and consistent with external financing
(see Annex I).
7. Credit to the private sector slowed
further in 2009 and financial sector
vulnerabilities have increased. The

The current account norm (i.e. equilibrium current
account deficit) is estimated using the fiscal- and oil

contraction of economic activity has resulted in
a significant slowdown in private sector credit
demand and commercial banks, in turn, have
been rebuilding their net foreign assets. While
domestic bank lending rates have remained
broadly stable, there are signs that conditions
in the RGSM have tightened recently, implying
higher cost of fiscal financing (see Annex II).
Reflecting the weakening economic
environment, banking sector indicators have
deteriorated and liquidity tightened during the

last two quarters. Non-performing loans
(NPLs) for the whole system rose from 6.7 to
8.3 percent of total loans during 2009. While
NPLs of both indigenous and foreign banks
increased by about 1.5 percentage points,
NPLs of indigenous banks reached
10.2 percent. In addition, some banks have
been offering a six-month moratorium on
principal payments on private sector loans,
hence underestimating NPLs.

III. Outlook and Risks
A fragile recovery is underway, but is subject
to significant downside risks.
8. The economy has begun a fragile
recovery in 2010 on the back of resurgence
in tourism and FDI-related and public
construction, but there are important
downside risks. Growth is expected to pick
up to about one percent in 2010 and increase
slowly to about 4 percent by 2015. For
St. Lucia to achieve higher growth rates,
additional structural reforms, a resumption of
some high-end tourism projects, and the
emergence of new growth areas will be
needed.

Staff Report Article IV 2010 Consultation-St. Lucia

9. Risks to the growth outlook are on the
downside and dependent on the strength
of the recovery in the demand for tourism.
These risks include a weaker than anticipated
outlook for St. Lucia’s main trading partners,
permanently lower-than-envisaged FDI flows,
policy slippages in the run up to the next
elections (which have to take place by
end-2011), weak implementation capacity, and
the ever-present threat of natural disasters.
Meanwhile, the economic downturn has
increased macro-financial risks both in
St. Lucia and the currency union. While direct
cross-country exposure appears to be modest,
there are risks to the indigenous banking
system from regional spillovers due to the

6

fragility of indigenous banks in other Eastern
Caribbean Currency Union (ECCU) countries.
10. The collapse of the Trinidad and
Tobago based CL Financial Group in
January 2009 has highlighted the risks of
regional spillovers and financial sector
vulnerabilities in the non-bank sector. The
conglomerate’s two insurance companies
(CLICO and BAICO), with operations in
St. Lucia and other ECCU countries, offered
traditional insurance products and deposit-like
instruments to invest in real estate projects
and over-leveraged sister companies. With the

deterioration of the global economic conditions
in 2008 and the collapse of the real estate
market in Florida, the group faced both
liquidity and solvency problems. While the
authorities in the region have reported that
BAICO is insolvent, St. Lucia’s exposure to it
is relatively small (0.3 percent of GDP).
Although information on the status of CLICO is
more limited and the country’s exposure
amounts to about 5.6 percent of GDP,
St. Lucia has pledged assets from CLICO
amounting to 50 percent of liabilities and
70 percent of deposit-like instruments
(see Annex III).

IV. Key Policies and Recommendations
The discussions focused on the adoption of a
fiscal framework that will support fiscal and
debt sustainability, a reduction in
vulnerabilities, and St. Lucia’s growth
prospects following the global downturn.

Fiscal Policy
The timing of the withdrawal of the fiscal
impulse needs to be carefully calibrated to
ensure continued fiscal and debt sustainability,
while minimizing an adverse implication on
employment.

11. The government has reiterated its
commitment to a medium-term fiscal
strategy, which would help achieve fiscal
and debt sustainability, yet current policies
are inadequate to meet the government’s
goals. The planned fiscal measures include
implementation of a broad-based value-added
tax (VAT), market based property taxes, a tax
on interest income, and vehicle licensing fees.
However, of the latter three measures, only
the increased licensing fee has been
implemented.

12. Fiscal policy in FY2009/10 was
expansionary and the deficit will exceed
the authorities’ policy commitment under
the RAC-ESF by a wide margin,
contributing to about 8 percent of GDP rise
in the public debt. This fiscal expansion in
FY2009/10 has led to a fiscal impulse close to
5 percent of GDP. Should this fiscal stance
persist into FY2010/11, it would imply a further
surge in public debt, which could heighten
financing pressures. Currently St. Lucia’s
gross financing needs are less than
10 percent of GDP, and its access to domestic
and regional financing is relatively good;
however, yields on government debt have
increased recently and the country’s share of
the regional government debt market already
amounts to 60 percent, which could raise the
cost of borrowing going forward.
13. Under current policies (the baseline
scenario)—the public debt is on an
unsustainable path. Without additional
measures, public debt is projected to rise to
about 88 percent of GDP by 2020.

14. The mission welcomes the
government’s renewed commitment to
medium-term fiscal consolidation, and
recommends the adoption of a
comprehensive fiscal framework. Such a
framework would lend credibility to the goal of

Staff Report Article IV 2010 Consultation-St. Lucia

achieving medium-term fiscal sustainability
and reach the authorities’ target of a debt-toGDP ratio of 60 percent by 2020, which is
paramount given the currency board
arrangement. The mission would underscore
the need for early implementation of the VAT
and other fiscal reforms. The mission also
recommends prioritization of expenditure
outlays to be consistent with available
concessional financing and implementation
capacity. In addition, given St. Lucia’s
relatively high revenue-to-GDP ratio, the
mission urges the authorities to consider a
broad-based public expenditure reform,9 step
up efforts to strengthen debt management
capacity, including the development of a
medium-term strategy, and improve the
capacity to conduct debt sustainability
analysis. The authorities should also build
fiscal space to be able to better absorb
external shocks (e.g. effects of natural
disasters, financial sector spillovers).
Furthermore, the authorities should increase
oversight of public enterprises, limit the use of
“design-finance-construct” facilities to
minimize contingent liabilities associated with
projects financed with private sector
participation.

An in depth FAD public expenditure TA mission is
tentatively scheduled for May 2010.

15. The large fiscal impulse in FY2009/10
poses challenges for medium-term fiscal
and debt sustainability. Accordingly, the
mission recommends adjustment measures
(the “active” scenario), which would reverse
about two-thirds of the FY2009/10 fiscal
impulse in the FY2010 budget aimed at
achieving small primary balance, and reaching
a surplus of about 1½ percent of GDP over the
medium term. Given that the full revenue
impact of the recommended measures would
only materialize in the following year, the debt-

to-GDP ratio would increase by one percent of
GDP in FY2010/11 before putting the country
on a firmly declining trajectory. The
implementation of the fiscal measures would
send a strong signal to market participants
about the government’s commitment to an exit
strategy and fiscal consolidation. Given the
small fiscal multiplier and significant room to
improve the efficiency and effectiveness of
public spending, the withdrawal is likely to
have a limited impact on growth.10

1/ The VAT will replace some of the existing consumption taxes. Its net yield is estimated to rise gradually to 2.5 percent of
GDP in the medium-term, with smaller impact in the initial years due to implementation adjustments.

16. An improvement in the efficiency of
spending would create space for higher
targeted social spending. The mission
welcomes the government’s commitment to
enhance protection of the most vulnerable
groups under a variety of social safety nets,
including increased pension allowances
targeted to the poor, and funding of social
protection projects to help achieve the
Millennium Development Goals. However,
such programs could be improved by greater
coordination between the implementing
agencies, better targeting of the conditional
cash transfer program, and streamlining of
programs that are not cost effective.11

Staff Report Article IV 2010 Consultation-St. Lucia

Addressing Vulnerabilities
Recent financial sector difficulties in the
Caribbean call for close monitoring, a
successful resolution of CL Financial, stronger
financial sector regulation and supervision,
(especially of the non-bank financial sector),
and measures to avoid regional
spillovers.

10

As a simplifying assumption both scenarios have
identical growth projections.

17. Banking soundness indicators have
deteriorated and contagion risks from the
rest of the region have increased. Although
St. Lucia’s banks were not directly exposed to
the financial crisis, the economic downturn has
increased credit risk, and the reduced asset
quality has weakened banks’ balance sheets.
In addition, there are risks to the banking
system from regional spillovers, given the
weakness of indigenous banks in some other
countries of the ECCU, and the wider
Caribbean. While direct cross-border linkages
are limited, spillovers could be propagated
through the payments system or a generalized
loss of confidence in indigenous banks, which
represent about 60 percent of total deposits.
18. The mission encourages the
authorities to prepare—in conjunction with
the ECCB—a full-scale contingency plan to
mitigate spillovers from potential financial
events in the region, particularly in light of
the latter’s limited role as a lender of last
resort. The authorities and the ECCB should
also continue to monitor closely banking
system indicators, particularly for indigenous
banks, given the risk of spillovers from such
banks in other ECCU countries.12 In light of
the vulnerabilities discussed above, the
mission underscores the benefits of keeping
St. Lucia’s SDR allocation as a pooled liquidity
buffer, and to promote this initiative among the
other ECCU countries.
19. Strengthening the supervision of the
domestic non-bank and offshore sectors
remains a high priority. Although St. Lucia’s
stronger regulatory framework for the
insurance sector spared them from the worst
effects of the collapse of the Trinidad-based
CL Financial Group (CLICO and BAICO), and

12

Most foreign banks are branches of Canadian
institutions, which have withstood the financial crisis
relatively well and benefit from access to liquidity from
their parent banks.

Staff Report Article IV 2010 Consultation-St. Lucia

the direct exposure of banks to the group
appears to be negligible, the regulation and
supervision of the non-bank sector—in
particular, credit unions—remains uneven.
St. Lucia’s offshore financial center is small
and its contribution to growth is insignificant. A
failure, however, to comply with tighter
international standards in the fiscal/tax and
financial/regulatory areas for offshore financial
centers (OFCs), as called for by the G-20,
could adversely impact the reputation of the
country as a high-end service provider. In the
case of OFCs, the authorities have made and
signed 6 of the required 12 tax information and
exchange agreements (TIEAs) and are
committed to the completion of the remaining
ones by end March. Staff urges the authorities
to take a more proactive stance during the
next stage of mutual evaluations to minimize
the risk of being labeled as non compliant.
20. Staff and the authorities agree on the
urgency of completing the remaining steps
to put in place a fully operational single
regulatory unit to provide a unified
regulatory framework for non-banks,
including credit unions and the insurance
industry. In this context, the mission
encourages the authorities to press ahead
with the adoption of the Financial Services
Regulatory Authority Act and other enabling
legislation including the 2009 Insurance Act.
The mission also supports the ECCU
authorities’ announced strategy of a regional
resolution of BAICO and welcomes the initial
steps toward its resolution, including the
establishment of a new company. In this
context staff reiterates that the resolution of
BAICO should adhere to three principles:
(i) avoid systemic contamination, (ii) minimize
the fiscal costs to the extent possible, given
the region’s high debt levels and related
vulnerabilities, and (iii) ensure equitable
treatment of claimants, including giving priority
to claims up to a low threshold.

10

Enhancing Competitiveness and
Growth
21. The exchange rate does not show
clear evidence of an overvaluation, but
structural reforms are needed to further
increase the growth potential of the
economy and reduce vulnerabilities. Staff
analysis indicates that St. Lucia’s real effective
exchange rate (REER) is close to its
equilibrium level, reflecting the weakening of
the U.S. dollar against major currencies
through 2002–2009. Since 2000, the
equilibrium REER has also fallen, due to the
ongoing decline in both the terms of trade (of
goods and services) and relative tourist
arrivals, and the accumulation of net foreign
liabilities. Assuming a resumption of FDI flows,
the external current account balance
converges to its norm of about 18 percent of
GDP. However, given the risk of permanently
lower FDI flows and to boost the long-run
growth potential, the elimination of labor
market constraints is paramount. Moreover,
St. Lucia’s share of stayover arrivals has
declined after peaking in 2005. The fiscal
measures recommended under the active
scenario would help reduce wage pressures
and create room for expanding the role of the
private sector.

constrained by the quasi currency board,
enhancing labor market flexibility is essential.
Given that public sector wages have a
demonstration effect on private wage
contracts, controlling increases in public sector
compensation would be an important step to
ensuring competitiveness and to maintaining
high levels of FDI inflows. Moreover,
improving the business climate, in particular
lowering the costs of starting a business and
simplifying the procedures for registering
properties, will be key to fostering investment
and private sector-led growth. At the same
time, the prospects of the offshore financial
sector for growth are likely to be limited in
St. Lucia and—given the increasing
compliance costs as a result of the latest G-20
initiatives—authorities may consider the
viability of remaining in the industry.

Other Issues

22. The mission and the authorities
concur on the importance of improving the
business climate and enhancing
productivity. With exchange rate adjustment

Staff Report Article IV 2010 Consultation-St. Lucia

23. While St. Lucia’s economic statistics
are adequate for surveillance, further
efforts are needed to improve the quality of
data, including timeliness, coverage, and
dissemination. In particular, the coverage of
tourism and FDI in the national accounts and
balance of payments call for further
improvement. Also, the country is lacking
reliable labor market statistics. Staff welcomes
the authorities’ focus on strengthening data
quality and provision, including by seeking
technical assistance from CARTAC and the
IMF.

V. The Authorities’ Views
24. The authorities agreed with the thrust
of staff’s assessment and
recommendations. They noted that—in line
with staff views—their main concern was
achieving medium-term fiscal and debt
sustainability. At the same time, they
highlighted that—as a small developing
country—social protection mechanisms were
underdeveloped, including the absence of
unemployment benefits. Therefore, given the
adverse implications of the global economic
and financial crisis for St. Lucia, the sizable
increase in public works projects served a dual
purpose of offsetting the employment impact,
while at the same time improving much
needed infrastructure for development. They
concurred with staff on the priority of resolving
the failed CL Financial Group in a regional
context, strengthening regulation and
supervision, especially of the non-bank
financial sector, and on measures to enhance
competitiveness and growth. They viewed the
reduction of financial sector vulnerabilities and
enhancement of competitiveness as important
for private sector led growth.

Growth Outlook
25. While broadly in agreement with
staff’s growth outlook, the authorities were
of the view that there was an upside,
especially with respect to tourism and
construction. In particular the authorities
pointed to the remobilization of some FDI
projects—with the expectation that others
would follow—the recent increase in the
number of flights to the island, and an
improvement in stayover arrivals. In this
context, they justified airline subsidies and
additional tourism marketing to maintain a
strong presence in the market so as not to be
disadvantaged when the global economy
begins to recover. The authorities are also of
the view that growth in 2010 will be supported

Staff Report Article IV 2010 Consultation-St. Lucia

by public sector construction as a number of
projects are slated for implementation.

Fiscal Policy
26. The authorities highlighted that the
increased spending on public works was
warranted to mitigate the negative
employment impact of the crisis. To that
effect they pointed to the positive employment
effects of the Holistic Opportunities for
Personal Empowerment (HOPE) project, with
its dual purpose of providing useable skills in
the context of community investment projects,
and at the same time advancing with a
number of high impact public investment
projects. In addition, major road projects were
undertaken under the “design, finance and
construct” framework. Moreover, the tax relief
to tourism helped to sustain activity in that
sector.
27. The authorities agreed on the need to
implement a credible fiscal framework.
They fully expect to return to fiscal
consolidation after the temporary easing of the
fiscal stance when the economy begins to
recover. The authorities noted the progress
made in moving forward with the
implementation of the vehicle license fees and
the property tax. Also, they remained
committed to the implementation of the VAT.
However, they emphasized the need to seek
broad-based political support and started a
consultative process. They remained hopeful
that the tax could be implemented by October.
There was general agreement on the need to
contain increases in the wage bill, but they
indicated that there was an urgent need to
address the shortage of security personnel to
help reduce crime. They plan to prioritize
capital expenditure, but were concerned about
reducing capital expenditure too abruptly in
view of the country’s large infrastructure

12

needs. In this context, the authorities
emphasized they would seek aggressively
grant financing to help reduce the impact of
higher capital outlays on the budget.
28. The authorities noted that they would
continue to implement the
recommendations of IMF technical
assistance on debt management. They are
building capacity to undertake debt
sustainability analysis and are looking forward
to develop a medium-term debt strategy,
which would help to avoid an increase in the
risk of debt distress.

Reducing Vulnerabilities
29. The authorities agreed with staff about
the risks of a possible spillover from
financial sector difficulties in other
Caribbean countries. In this regard, they
indicated that strengthening financial sector
supervision and regulation was a top priority
and stressed that they had made significant
progress in passing financial sector legislation,
including the Financial Services Regulatory
Act, which would create a common framework
for the regulation and supervision of nonbanks. They concurred with staff on using the

SDR allocation as a buffer for the financial
sector and would encourage other ECCU
countries to do the same. They also agreed on
the three principles for the resolution of
BAICO. On offshore financial centers (OFCs),
they pointed out that they were on track to
complete the signing of the necessary
12 TIEAs by end March. At the same time they
indicated an assessment of the benefits and
costs of the sector is warranted.

Enhancing Competitiveness and
Growth
30. The staff agreed with the authorities
on the need to enhance competitiveness
and productivity in the public service.
Authorities plan to implement civil service
reform that would increase productivity, permit
remuneration consistent with productivity
growth, and minimize the loss of skilled human
resources. In this context, they welcomed IMF
technical assistance and emphasized that they
were also seeking assistance from the World
Bank. At the same time, the authorities
confirmed that they would continue moving
forward with improvements in the business
climate.

VI. Staff Assessment
31. The St. Lucian economy is showing
signs of emerging from a very sharp
recession, but there are still risks to the
growth outlook. Precipitated by the global
economic downturn, the marked decline in
tourist arrivals and FDI-financed construction
activity led to a contraction of the economy by
about 5 percent, despite a significant fiscal
stimulus. While the outlook for 2010 points to
a nascent recovery, it is likely to be slow with
significant downside risks.

Staff Report Article IV 2010 Consultation-St. Lucia

32. The expansionary fiscal policy
pursued by the authorities during
FY2009/10 has significantly raised the
fiscal deficit and public debt ratios. Faced
with a more severe recession than anticipated,
the authorities relaxed their fiscal target
significantly as compared to the one
envisaged at the time of the RAC-ESF. While
the fiscal impact has mitigated the adverse
employment impact of the downturn and
protect the most vulnerable groups from its
knock on effects, the fiscal stimulus was large
and—given the higher public debt levels—

13

increased vulnerabilities. Therefore, the
challenge will be to put in place a credible
fiscal framework and return to fiscal
consolidation in FY2010/11—while minimizing
any adverse implications for growth and
employment.
33. Putting the public debt on a firmly
declining path requires both revenue and
spending measures. In this context, it is
important to press ahead with the planned tax
reforms, in particular with the rapid
implementation of the VAT. In addition,
following a significant increase in publicworks-related outlays in FY2009/10, a
measured withdrawal of the stimulus is
needed. The authorities plan to reduce capital
spending back to historical levels in the
medium term. However, a reduction in capital
spending in FY2010/11 is needed to reduce
the risk of possible financing pressures and to
help achieve primary surplus of about
1½ percent of GDP over the medium term.
34. Expenditure has been reallocated
toward addressing St. Lucia’s large
infrastructure needs and to help sustain
activity in the tourism industry. The benefits
of broad incentives package for tourism,
including moratoria on taxes on the industry
and subsidies to airlines are likely to be mixed.
The increased capital expenditure to enhance
critical infrastructure will aid the recovery when
external conditions turn around. In this regard
public expenditure reform over the medium
term and accessing to more concessional
resources would create space for higher
targeted social spending and for mitigating the
effects of natural disasters.

Staff Report Article IV 2010 Consultation-St. Lucia

35. St. Lucia’s exchange rate does not
show clear evidence of an overvaluation.
The economy has benefited from the
depreciation of the U.S. dollar and while still
elevated, the external current account deficit
has narrowed substantially during the last
year. At the same time, to increase the growth
potential of the economy and to minimize the
risk of permanently lower FDI flows, St. Lucia
needs to move forward with structural reforms.
The authorities have rightly placed high priority
on improving the business climate, reducing
the cost of doing business, and boosting labor
productivity.
36. The financial system has been hit both
by the collapse of CL financial and the
economic downturn. Reducing financial
sector vulnerabilities remains a top priority.
The authorities’ regional approach to resolving
the insurance sector difficulties seems
appropriate and the resolution should avoid
systemic contagion, minimize the costs borne
by regional governments, and be equitable to
all stakeholders. In the same vein, the
authorities are coordinating with other member
countries of the ECCB on legislation needed
to strengthen regulation and supervision of the
nonblank financial sector, while ensuring that
offshore sector regulation meets international
standards. Given that banking soundness
indicators have deteriorated and there is risk
of contagion from other countries in the
ECCU, it is commendable that the authorities
intend to keep the SDR allocation as a pooled
liquidity buffer and to promote this imitative
among the other ECCU countries.
37. It is recommended that the next Article
IV consultation take place on the 12 month
cycle.

Annex I: Exchange Rate Assessment
1. St. Lucia’s exchange rate does not show clear evidence of an overvaluation based on the
CGER methodology1. The equilibrium real exchange rate (ERER) methodology indicates an
overvaluation of about 6 percent, which lies within the 95 percent confidence interval. Reflecting the
depreciation of the U.S. dollar over the last couple of years, the real exchange rate has declined as
the equilibrium exchange rate fell.
2. Large equilibrium current account deficits, in most cases driven by FDI-financed imports,
are a phenomenon observed in all ECCU countries. Under the macro balance approach, staff
estimates that St. Lucia’s equilibrium current account balance (current account “norm”) is around
18 percent of GDP when the methodology uses coefficients from regressions based on a CARICOMonly sample, and close to 17 percent when the sample is expanded to a larger set of tourismdependent countries (see IMF Country Report No. 08/96), which implies an overvaluation of about
3 percent. FDI explains an important part of the unusually large current account norm. However the
large commercial bank inflows helped finance the current account balance in 2008. A reversal of
these flows as occurred in 2009 would help to close the gap between the actual and predicted current
account. Over the medium term the current account balance is projected to rise slowly to around
24 percent of GDP reflecting the recovery in FDI inflows.
3. Notwithstanding these results, it is also relevant to disentangle the impact of transient
shocks in crisis-years from the risk of permanent changes in St. Lucia’s current account
dynamics. In the table below, we estimate the decline on travel receipts and imports of goods
following the global recession of 2008–09, and the underlying current account balance after
controlling for that shock. The results indicate that, if it is assumed a slow recovery in the tourism
sector, then the demand for tourism-related projects will be stagnant, which is reflected on lowerthan-average FDI flows (the spike in FDI in 2006 and 2007 is in large part a one off associated with
construction related to the 2007 Cricket World Cup). In addition, considering that the import content of
FDI is about 80 percent, imports are not expected to return to their pre-crisis levels, which would
leave a current account balance excluding FDI-related imports close to 8 percent of GDP by 2015. In
the absence productivity enhancing measures and improvements in non-price competitiveness, this
would imply an annual accumulation of external debt of about 8 percent of GDP under the baseline
projection. Moreover, the lack of FDI-financed projects could result in a long-term deterioration in the
competitiveness of St. Lucia’s tourism sector.

Information deficiencies, particularly on nonbank private sector assets and liabilities, preclude the use of the external
sustainability approach.

Annex II: Access to the Regional Government Securities
Market (RGSM)
1. St. Lucia is a dominant player on the RGSM. Since issuing for the first time in 2004, St. Lucia
has issued more securities in the regional market than any other country in each successive year. At
end-2009, the value of St. Lucia’s securities outstanding constituted 58 percent of the RGSM. This
represents about 32 percent of St. Lucia’s total public debt and about 5 percent of ECCU GDP.
2. St. Lucia’s debt profile. As at end-December 2009, 50 percent of St. Lucia’s public sector debt
is in bonds (with average maturity of about 6 years), 5 percent in treasury bills, and 45 percent in
loans. The expectation is that these instruments will be rolled over on maturity, which eliminates the
cost of carry involved in establishing sinking funds—as was common in the past. The government
intends to rely more on securities to finance its budget deficits, which reinforces the need to actively
manage government debt.
3. Subscriptions on the RGSM remain firm. Demand for St. Lucia’s securities, unlike for its
regional peers, has remained high on the RGSM. In 2009, St. Lucia was able to issue securities on
13 occasions, which were all over-subscribed. The market appetite for St. Lucia’s debt reflects the
authorities’ prudent fiscal policies and sound debt management practices.
4. Bond yields have increased recently. While yields on St. Lucia’s public sector debt have
remained broadly stable in recent years, interest rates on longer-term maturities have begun to rise in
recent months due, in part, to greater utilization of the RGSM. Given these developments, it is
paramount that the government reins in fiscal deficits and implements a credible fiscal framework.

Annex III: Macro-Financial Risks
1. The economic downturn has increased macro-financial risks in the region. While direct crosscountry exposure appears to be modest, there are risks to the banking system from regional
spillovers, particularly in view of the ECCB’s limited capacity to act as lender-of-last-resort. In addition
to the risk of a spillover from weak indigenous banks in other ECCU countries, the collapse of the
Trinidad and Tobago-based CL Financial group in January 2009 represents a major challenge to
financial system stability. These risks underscore the need for enhanced monitoring and
strengthening supervision and regulation of the financial system.
2. Direct cross-country exposure of St. Lucian banks to the rest of the ECCU appears to be
limited. Balances due from banks in other ECCU economies were EC$ 330 million (6 percent of total
assets of the banking system) at end-December, 2009. Indigenous banks had claims on other ECCU
banks amounting to EC$50 million (less than 3 percent of total assets) at the same date. However,
there is a risk of contagion from banks in other ECCU countries via the shared payments system and
a generalized loss of confidence.
3. Regarding the insurance sector, two of CL Financial subsidiaries, the British American
Insurance Company (BAICO) and the Colonial Life Insurance Company (CLICO), with
extensive branch networks in the ECCU countries, had been offering deposit-like products.
Regional authorities responsible for the resolution of the insurance sector have reported that BAICO
is insolvent, with an estimated negative net worth of EC$981.5 million (7.9 percent of GDP) at the
regional level. At the same time, the authorities in the region have taken steps to set up a new
insurance company. The exposure of St. Lucian residents to BAICO and CLICO amounts to about
6 percent of GDP. While the direct exposure of banks and other financial intermediaries to the former
appear to be negligible, the value of collateral insured by BAICO might adversely be affected. In
addition, while information on the value of CLICO’s assets is still limited, St. Lucia has pledged assets
from CLICO amounting to 50 percent of liabilities and 70 percent of deposit-like instruments.
4. These macro-financial risks reinforce the need for fiscal policy to contain increases in the
public debt and to strengthen financial sector oversight. Resolution of these problems could
increase the already high public debt burden, and add to the susceptibility of the economy to natural
disasters and other debt-related vulnerabilities. In this context, the near-term challenge is to ensure
that the resolution of the insurance companies avoids systemic contamination, minimizes the fiscal
cost, and provides equitable treatment to all policyholders. This may include lowering of interest rates,
extension of tenor, and possible conversion of some liabilities into equity. Strengthening financial
sector regulation would be a high priority. In this respect, the authorities are in the process of
establishing a single regulatory unit for non-bank financial institutions (e.g., credit unions, building
societies, and insurance companies). In the medium term, the establishment of a regional non-bank
financial regulator might be warranted to avoid regulatory arbitrage across ECCU countries.

Staff Report Article IV 2010 Consultation-St. Lucia

Annex IV: Improving the Efficiency of Public Expenditure
1. As in the other ECCU countries, policymaking in St. Lucia is constrained by the currency board
arrangement. Sound fiscal policy and an efficient public sector are, therefore, paramount both for
macroeconomic stability and the country’s competitiveness. The impact of the global financial and
economic crisis has brought to the fore the need to increase fiscal space to better absorb shocks.
Also, the risk of permanently lower FDI and tourist arrivals calls for continued efforts to improve
competitiveness. Given St. Lucia’s relatively high revenue-to-GDP ratio, efforts to create fiscal space
will have to focus more on the expenditure side. Rationalizing government expenditures could
generate fiscal savings, while simultaneously enhancing the efficiency and effectiveness of
government spending programs.
2. Central government expenditure in St. Lucia was about 36 percent of GDP in 2009
(see Table). While this is less than the average in other ECCU countries, public expenditures have
increased sharply during the FY2009/10. Part of the sharp acceleration is due to a large increase in
capital expenditure associated with the fiscal stimulus. Nevertheless, there has also been a significant
increase in current spending, especially for wages and salaries. This trend is mirrored by the rest of
the ECCU, albeit at a lower rate. The following reviews selected public expenditure policy issues in
St. Lucia. A more comprehensive study based on a forthcoming IMF technical assistance mission will
be prepared for the 2010 ECCU Common Policy Discussion.

Public Sector Wages and Employment
3. In line with other ECCU countries, central government wages and salaries averaged about
12 percent of GDP during 2006–08. However, the wage bill grew rapidly in 2009, reaching almost
14 percent of GDP, with a further increase expected in 2010. This is due both to increase in wages,
as well as in employment. About 5.5 percent of the population was employed in the public sector in
2008—second only to Antigua and Barbuda among the independent ECCU countries.
4. The government is committed to reforming the public sector with a view to enhancing its
efficiency. Towards that end, the authorities have initiated a functional review of government
ministries with assistance from the World Bank. The authorities also plan to reform human resource
management and legal framework for public service. A review of the pay negotiation framework is
also part of the reform program.

Health Spending
5. The public sector is the dominant provider of health care services in St. Lucia. User fees
are charged for some services at hospitals and health centers, but these typically account for a small
portion of total health financing. General government spending on health is about 3 percent of GDP,
on average. This is slightly less than the average for other independent ECCU countries.
6. St. Lucia has relatively good health indicators for a country at its income level of GDP per
capita. Nevertheless, there are concerns about the quality and coverage of health care services.
Only about a quarter of the population is covered by health insurance and the number of uninsured is

Staff Report Article IV 2010 Consultation-St. Lucia

31

rising, especially among the poor. Health care costs are expected to rise in the future with an ageing
population raising concerns regarding the sustainability of the current health financing system.
7. There may be scope for improving efficiency of health spending by reorganizing and
consolidating some of the health facilities in the country. Better coordination of health services at
the regional level, similar to the successful OECS pharmaceutical procurement program, could also
enhance efficiency of health services

Education
8. Public education spending exceeds 6 percent of GDP. This is higher than that in Latin
America and Caribbean countries, but less than in some of the other independent ECCU countries.
Such a high level of expenditure reflects the government’s commitment to education. In recent years,
there has also been a shift in expenditure composition away from wages towards capital and other
current spending.
9. More efficient delivery of education services can help achieve better outcomes, while also
generating some fiscal savings. This could be achieved by raising the pupil-teacher ratio in both
primary and secondary education and increasing non-government financing of tertiary education.
Better targeting of school feeding and free text book programs could also result in improved equity
and efficiency of these programs.

Social Assistance
10. St. Lucia implements a range of social assistance programs designed to address most of
the key poverty and vulnerability issues. These include public works programs, transfers,
subsidies, labor-market programs, and public assistance programs. Social assistance expenditures
are estimated at about 1.3 percent of GDP in FY2008/09, about at par with that in Latin America and
Caribbean region, but less than in some of the other independent ECCU countries.
11. A large number of programs implemented by different government agencies result in
overlap and duplication, with high start-up and operating costs. At the same time, some of the
public assistance programs are not well-targeted. Combining programs with similar objectives and
improved targeting could help minimize leakage and ensure that social assistance objectives are
achieved in a cost-effective manner. Linking some assistance programs to specific requirements such
as schooling or health clinic attendance may contribute to poverty alleviation by promoting investment
in human and physical asset base.

Pensions
12. While contribution income of the National Insurance Corporation (NIC) currently exceeds
its payments, the 2003 actuarial review suggests that, with a rapidly ageing population,
pension reserves are projected to begin declining in 2048 and be exhausted by 2063. Recent
reform measures, which included raising the retirement age to 65, increasing the number of
contributions required for retirement pension, and a reduction in the maximum pensions, have been
steps in the right direction. The government also reformed the civil servants’ pension by making it
contributory since 2003. These reforms have improved the financial sustainability of the system by
pushing outward the date by which reserves would be exhausted. Nevertheless, additional parametric
reforms may be needed to ensure long run sustainability of the pension system. Such reforms will be

Annex V: The Authorities’ Response to Recent Fund
Policy Advice
1. In the 2008 Article IV Consultation, Directors highlighted that further fiscal consolidation
was necessary and recommended to move quickly to broaden the tax base through the
introduction of a more flexible domestic petroleum pricing mechanism, the VAT, and the
market valuation-based property taxation. So far, the authorities have implemented the domestic
petroleum pricing mechanism and have started a consultative process on the implementation of the
VAT to ensure broad-based political support. In addition, staff advised that capital expenditures
needed to be prioritized and properly evaluated, while the growth in the civil service wage bill should
be limited. To achieve this, the authorities have requested IMF TA and a mission is tentatively
scheduled for May 2010. Moreover, Directors called for closer monitoring of the financial sector
vulnerabilities, and strengthening of social safety nets. In the case of the financial sector, the
authorities have moved expeditiously and are tighten financial sector regulation and supervision,
especially in the non-bank sector.

April 2, 2010

International Monetary Fund
700 19th Street, NW
Washington, D. C. 20431 USA

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2010 Article IV Consultation with
St. Lucia
On March, 15, 2010, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF)
concluded the Article IV consultation with St. Lucia.1
Background
Macroeconomic outcomes have weakened significantly. Real GDP is estimated to have
contracted by 5.2 percent in 2009, reflecting a sharp decline in visitor arrivals and
construction activity related to Foreign Direct Investment (FDI). For 2010, the outlook is
for a nascent recovery, supported by higher advance hotel bookings and additional
flights to the island. However, there are a number of downside risks to the outlook,
including lower than the anticipated recovery in St. Lucia’s main trading partners and
FDI inflows. Inflation has declined from 7.2 percent in 2008 to 0.6 percent in 2009, and
is expected to remain in the low single digits over the medium term.
The fiscal position is estimated to have deteriorated sharply in FY2009/10, mainly on
account of an increase in public expenditure. The primary fiscal balance is expected to
shift from a surplus of about 2.3 percent of GDP in FY2008/09 to a deficit of about
2.5 percent in FY2009/10. On the revenue side, the cyclical decline was somewhat
contained by a 20 percent increase in the prices of petroleum products in August 2009
1

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On
return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the
Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the
Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the
country's authorities.

and the adoption of a flexible energy-pricing regime. The implementation of other
revenue-enhancing measures (including a value-added tax) envisaged by the authorities
at the time of the RAC-ESF Executive Board approval, however, has yet to occur. On
the expenditure side, the authorities undertook a large public works program, resulting in
capital expenditure increase of about 3 percent of GDP. The fiscal deficit is expected to
be financed mainly by issuing securities on the Regional Government Securities Market
(RGSM).
External imbalances have narrowed in 2009. The external current account deficit is
projected to have declined by about 11 percentage points of GDP in 2009, reflecting
lower FDI-related imports and smaller food and fuel import bills. Stayover arrivals are
projected to decline by 6 percent (year-on-year), but discounting of hotel room rates and
lower spending by tourists would result in a larger decline in tourism receipts. In
addition, remittances are projected to decline in line with employment opportunities in
migrant host countries. At about 20 percent of GDP, the estimated external current
account deficit is close to its historical level and consistent with identified external
financing.
In 2009, credit to the private sector continued to decline and financial sector
vulnerabilities have increased. The contraction in economic activity has resulted in a
significant slowdown in private sector credit demand. At the same time, the weakening
economic environment has led to an increase in non-performing loans and deterioration
in other bank soundness indicators. While domestic bank lending rates have remained
broadly stable, there are signs that conditions in the RGSM have tightened recently. The
collapse of the Trinidad and Tobago-based CL Financial Group with operations in
St. Lucia and other Eastern Caribbean Currency Union countries has highlighted
weaknesses in the regulation and supervision of the non-bank financial sector.
Executive Board Assessment
The Executive Directors observed that the global downturn had led to a marked decline
in St. Lucia’s economic activity. The economy is recently showing welcome signs of an
emerging recovery, although downside risks remain given the continued dependence on
tourism. While the expansionary fiscal policy has helped to mitigate the adverse impact
of the global crisis and protect the most vulnerable segments of the population, it has
raised the fiscal deficit and public debt ratios significantly.
Against this backdrop, Directors welcomed the authorities’ commitment to implement a
credible fiscal framework to achieve fiscal sustainability, while minimizing adverse
implications for growth and employment. They encouraged the authorities to move
ahead with the implementation of the planned value-added tax in 2010, and to embark
on a measured withdrawal of discretionary spending, including by scaling back capital
spending. Over the medium term, Directors emphasized the need to prioritize and
improve the efficiency of public spending, to contain the growth of the public wage bill,

36

and to seek more concessional financing in order to create fiscal space for higher
targeted social spending and to absorb external shocks.
Directors noted staff’s assessment that St. Lucia’s exchange rate does not show clear
evidence of an overvaluation. Given risks of lower FDI inflows, and to increase the
growth potential, they encouraged the authorities to move forward on structural reforms,
including improving the business climate and boosting labor productivity.
Directors observed that the financial system has been hit by both the economic
downturn and the collapse of the CL-Financial Group. Given the deterioration in bank
soundness indicators, they encouraged the authorities to closely monitor the financial
sector and take action as needed. Directors welcomed the authorities’ regional
approach to the strengthening of regulation and supervision of nonbank financial
institutions and the resolution of the insurance company BAICO. They looked forward to
the adoption of the Financial Services Regulatory Act and related legislation. Directors
commended the authorities’ intention to keep the SDR allocation as a pooled liquidity
buffer.

Public Information Notices (PINs) form part of the IMF's efforts to promote transparency of the IMF's
views and analysis of economic developments and policies. With the consent of the country
(or countries) concerned, PINs are issued after Executive Board discussions of Article IV consultations
with member countries, of its surveillance of developments at the regional level, of post-program
monitoring, and of ex post assessments of member countries with longer-term program engagements.
PINs are also issued after Executive Board discussions of general policy matters, unless otherwise
decided by the Executive Board in a particular case.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND
ST. LUCIA
External and Public Debt Sustainability Analysis
Prepared by the Staff of the International Monetary Fund
February 26, 2010
This debt sustainability analysis (DSA) assesses the sustainability of St. Lucia’s public and external
debt. The analysis—which reflects recent surge in the debt level, lower growth arising from a
possible prolonged weakness in the global economy, and vulnerability to natural disasters—
indicates that, under current fiscal policies, St. Lucia runs a moderate risk of debt distress.
A. Introduction
St. Lucia, like many other tourism-dependent countries in the Caribbean, has been
significantly impacted by the 2008–09 global economic and financial crises. After expanding on
average by about 3 percent during 2004–08, economic activity contracted by about 5 percent in
2009, reflecting a sharp fall in tourist arrivals and FDI-financed construction activity. Fiscal
imbalances widened, mainly on account of the cyclical downturn, the discretionary spending
measures taken by the central government to cushion the impact of the crisis on unemployment, and
delays in the implementation of revenue-enhancing tax measures envisaged at the time of the
RAC-ESF request. As a result, the primary fiscal balance (as a percentage of GDP) reverted by
almost 5 percentage points, from a surplus of 2.2 percent in 2008 to a deficit of 2.5 percent of GDP
in 2009. Reflecting the fiscal deterioration, as well as off-budget expenditures related to the
construction and financing of public projects by the private sector (design, finance, and construct),
which amounted to almost 1.7 percent of GDP, gross public sector debt increased from about
66¼ percent of GDP in 2008 to about 74¾ percent in 2009. Meanwhile, St. Lucia’s public external
debt increased to 40.2 percent of GDP (from 36.7 percent in 2008), but the country’s risk of debt
distress remains moderate.
1.

B. Baseline Assumptions for the DSA
St. Lucia’s DSA is built on a baseline scenario that assumes: (i) real GDP growth rising to
about 3.9 percent over the medium term; and (ii) a compression of the primary fiscal balance
towards a steady deficit of one percent of GDP over the same period. The envisaged paths for real
GDP growth and the primary fiscal balance are subject to downside risks, including those arising
from volatile FDI and grant inflow. While FDI inflows are projected to revert back to historical
levels of about 14 percent of GDP in the medium-term, they are lower than during 2006–07 given
spikes related to the preparation for the West Indies Cricket World Cup. If grant inflows were to be
lower than envisaged under the baseline projection, capital expenditure would need to be scaled

back further to achieve a primary fiscal balance of about -0.2 percent of GDP—the level required to
stabilize the debt-to-GDP ratio.
The deficit is assumed to be financed mainly through borrowing in the Regional
Government Securities Market (RGSM), which is held by both domestic and foreign investors,
along with limited multilateral borrowing reflecting Caribbean Development Bank (CDB) terms.
While exports of goods as a percent of GDP would gradually decrease to an average 12¾ percent
(from currently 15 percent), tourism receipts would slowly catch up to pre-crisis levels, averaging
33¼ percent of GDP in the longer term, in the context of a moderate recovery in tourism-related
FDI inflows. The associated external current account deficit converges to about 23 percent of GDP,
in line with pre-crisis levels.
3.

Box 1. Macroeconomic Assumptions under the Baseline Scenario (2010–29)


Following a prolonged slowdown in the aftermath of the global recession, real
GDP growth is projected to average about 3.9 percent over the longer term.
Inflation is expected to remain in the low single digits, anchored by the
currency board arrangement.



The primary fiscal deficit of the central government (including grants) is
projected to converge to about one percent of GDP by 2013, reflecting three
core elements of the baseline fiscal stance:(a) the fiscal stimulus provided by
the government to contain the surge on unemployment in the aftermath of the
global financial crisis; (b) the projected increase in the wage bill to about
12 percent of GDP in FY 2010/11, and (c) the delays in the implementation of
critical revenue-enhancing tax measures, such as the single-rate value-added
tax.



Capital grants are conservatively projected at 0.9 percent of GDP starting in
2012, consistent with the historical average, while capital expenditure reverts to
8¾ percent of GDP over the longer term.



Following a sharp decline in 2008–09, FDI inflows are assumed to only
partially recover the pre-crisis levels, averaging about 14 percent over the
medium term. The current account deficit is projected to converge to 23 percent
of GDP, reflecting persistently lower FDI-related imports.

3

C. Evaluation of External Debt Sustainability under Baseline Scenario
Reflecting its relatively sound policies and institutional framework, St. Lucia has been
classified as a strong performer according to the CPIA rating system, with an average rating of 3.93
for 2005–08. As a strong performer, St. Lucia’s prudential thresholds on the present value (PV) of
debt-to-GDP, debt-to-exports and debt-to-revenue are, respectively, 50, 200 and 300 percent.

4.

Notwithstanding its performance in the recent past, the global financial crisis has led
St. Lucia to an overall fiscal deficit of about 7¾ percent of GDP in 2009 (including liabilities
related to the construction and financing of public projects by the private sector), with a projected
average medium-term deficit of about 6 percent of GDP under the baseline scenario. As a result, in
the absence of additional fiscal measures the PV of external debt is set to increase to about
51 percent of GDP by 2029, breaching the relevant threshold of debt distress. All other debt and
debt service ratios increase substantially over the medium and longer terms, but do not cross the
respective thresholds. For this reason, St. Lucia’s risk of external debt distress remains moderate
(see Figures A1–A2 and Tables A1–A4).

5.

Sensitivity analysis shows that the level of external debt is most responsive to an extreme
shock of nominal exchange rate depreciation. Under this scenario—with a one-time 30 percent
nominal depreciation relative to the baseline in 2010—the PV of external debt-to-GDP ratio would
breach the debt-to-GDP threshold of 50 percent (Table A2, Scenario B6). Similarly, the most
extreme export shock scenario—of export growth at one standard deviation below the historical
average in 2010–11—would push the debt service-to-exports ratio to slightly above the 25 percent
threshold in three years (Table A2, Scenario B2).
6.

7.
St. Lucia’s external debt sustainability analysis includes only public sector debt, as
information on private sector external borrowing is not available.

D. Evaluation of Public Sector Debt Sustainability under Baseline Scenario
The combination of a recession and counter-cyclical fiscal policies in 2009 resulted in a
debt-to-GDP ratio that is 8 percentage points higher than in 2008. Consequently, under the baseline
scenario the rate of debt accumulation is about 3 percent of GDP per year. Moreover, the debt
service as a share of current revenue and grants is expected to increase to about 63 percent in 2029
from 33½ percent in 2009. Under the most extreme shock scenarios, keeping the primary balance at
the 2009 level will push the NPV of the total debt to 103 percent of GDP by 2020, while having a
one-time depreciation will take the debt to 116 percent of GDP by that year.
8.

Given St. Lucia’s high public debt-to-GDP ratio, its recent debt dynamics, and the everpresent risks of natural disasters, the vulnerabilities of its public debt remain elevated. In addition,
the recovery from the global downturn is expected to be slower than in advance economies, as
demand for tourism is projected to remain subdued for a prolonged period of time. In recent years,
9.

4

St. Lucia has relied heavily on private financing sources (in lieu of concessional financing), which
has increased the cost of financing and rollover risks. Due to the small pool of creditors in the
regional markets, the risks of exhausting financing sources have increased (see background note on
the Regional Government Securities Market). If it becomes necessary to tap private international
financial markets outside of the RGSM, St. Lucia may obtain a credit rating under unfavorable
circumstances and will be compared to other emerging markets in the region, which will likely
imply a sustained widening of sovereign spreads. This could raise interest payments, which will, in
turn, require a credible fiscal framework that yields higher primary surpluses necessary to restore
debt sustainability. Finally, possible contingent liabilities from the non-banking financial sector
could also raise the required primary surplus.
E. External and Public Debt Dynamics under the Active Scenario
The deterioration in debt dynamics underscores the need for an exit strategy from the fiscal
stimulus that does not jeopardize St. Lucia’s growth prospects. Projections show that the
implementation of the planned tax measures and some tightening of discretionary expenditure, as
recommended in active scenario described in the staff report, would deliver the primary surpluses
necessary to put St. Lucia’s public debt-to-GDP ratio on a firmly downward trajectory over the
medium term. By targeting a primary fiscal surplus of about 1.6 percent over the medium and long
term, the stock of debt would decline to about 58 percent of GDP by 2020—i.e., slightly below the
Eastern Caribbean Central Bank’s benchmark of 60 percent—and to 42 percent by 2029.
Moreover, the external debt would be cut by almost a half over the projection period, declining to
22.3 percent of GDP by 2029. All relevant indicators of debt distress would show patterns of steady
improvement; particularly with respect to debt service ratios (see Figures A3–A4 and Tables A5–
A8.).The deterioration in debt dynamics also calls for a strengthening of debt management capacity,
including the development of a medium-term strategy and improvement in capacity to conduct debt
sustainability analysis. A reversal of the trend toward shortening the maturity profile of the debt in
recent years could also help avoid a rise in the debt service ratio over the medium term—one of the
main contributors to the rising risk of debt distress.
10.

F. Conclusions
Staff analysis shows that, under the baseline scenario (with an average primary deficit of
around one percent of GDP over the medium and longer terms), imbalances for the overall public
sector would be on an increasing and unsustainable path, achieving a public debt-to-GDP ratio of
about 88 percent by 2020—the timetable for attaining the 60 percent of GDP debt benchmark of the
Eastern Caribbean Central Bank. St. Lucia would then continue to increase its stock of public debt
steadily, reaching 96 percent of GDP by 2029.
11.

Also noteworthy, under the baseline scenario the public external debt is set to increase by
1/3 percent per year, and the present value of the external debt-to-GDP ratio is set to breach the
50 percent threshold by 2027. However, other relevant thresholds are expected to be respected, and
12.

5

for this reason St. Lucia’s risk of external debt distress remains moderate. Nevertheless, some
caution should be used in interpreting these results as private external debt data are not available,
and under the most extreme shock scenario up to three thresholds (the PV of debt-to-GDP, debt
service-to-exports, and debt service-to-revenue ratios) would be breached over the projection
period.

Includes public sector guaranteed and non-guaranteed external debt.
Derived as [r - g - ρ(1+g)]/(1+g+ρ+gρ) times previous period debt ratio, with r = nominal interest rate; g = real GDP growth rate, and ρ = growth rate of GDP deflator in U.S. dollar terms.
Includes exceptional financing (i.e., changes in arrears and debt relief); changes in gross foreign assets; and valuation adjustments. For projections also includes contribution from price and exchange rate changes.
Assumes that PV of private sector debt is equivalent to its face value.
Current-year interest payments divided by previous period debt stock.
Historical averages and standard deviations are generally derived over the past 10 years, subject to data availability.
Defined as grants, concessional loans, and debt relief.
Grant-equivalent financing includes grants provided directly to the government and through new borrowing (difference between the face value and the PV of new debt).

1/ Variables include real GDP growth, growth of GDP deflator (in U.S. dollar terms), non-interest current account in percent of GDP, and non-debt creating flows.
2/ Assumes that the interest rate on new borrowing is by 2 percentage points higher than in the baseline., while grace and maturity periods are the same as in the baseline.
3/ Exports values are assumed to remain permanently at the lower level, but the current account as a share of GDP is assumed to return to its baseline level after the shock
(implicitly assuming an offsetting adjustment in import levels).
4/ Includes official and private transfers and FDI.
5/ Depreciation is defined as percentage decline in dollar/local currency rate, such that it never exceeds 100 percent.
6/ Applies to all stress scenarios except for A2 (less favorable financing) in which the terms on all new financing are as specified in footnote 2.

Includes public sector guaranteed and non-guaranteed external debt.
Derived as [r - g - ρ(1+g)]/(1+g+ρ+gρ) times previous period debt ratio, with r = nominal interest rate; g = real GDP growth rate, and ρ = growth rate of GDP deflator in U.S. dollar terms.
Includes exceptional financing (i.e., changes in arrears and debt relief); changes in gross foreign assets; and valuation adjustments. For projections also includes contribution from price and exchange rate changes
Assumes that PV of private sector debt is equivalent to its face value.
Current-year interest payments divided by previous period debt stock.
Historical averages and standard deviations are generally derived over the past 10 years, subject to data availability.
Defined as grants, concessional loans, and debt relief.
Grant-equivalent financing includes grants provided directly to the government and through new borrowing (difference between the face value and the PV of new debt).

1/ Variables include real GDP growth, growth of GDP deflator (in U.S. dollar terms), non-interest current account in percent of GDP, and non-debt creating flows.
2/ Assumes that the interest rate on new borrowing is by 2 percentage points higher than in the baseline., while grace and maturity periods are the same as in the baseline.
3/ Exports values are assumed to remain permanently at the lower level, but the current account as a share of GDP is assumed to return to its baseline level after the shock
(implicitly assuming an offsetting adjustment in import levels).
4/ Includes official and private transfers and FDI.
5/ Depreciation is defined as percentage decline in dollar/local currency rate, such that it never exceeds 100 percent.
6/ Applies to all stress scenarios except for A2 (less favorable financing) in which the terms on all new financing are as specified in footnote 2.

IX. Exchange Arrangement: St. Lucia is part of the Eastern Caribbean Currency Union
(ECCU), which comprises five additional Fund Members (Antigua and Barbuda, Dominica,
Grenada, St. Kitts and Nevis, and St. Vincent and the Grenadines; and two territories of the
United Kingdom. These eight ECCU members have a common currency, monetary policy,
and exchange rate system. The common currency, the Eastern Caribbean (EC) dollar, has
been pegged to the U.S. dollar at the rate of EC$2.70 per U.S. dollar since July 1976. The
common central bank, the Eastern Caribbean Central Bank (ECCB), has operated like a
quasi-currency board, maintaining foreign exchange backing of its currency and demand
liabilities of close to 100 percent.

Appendix II. St. Lucia: Relations with the World Bank Group
(As of January 27, 2010)
The World Bank is in the process of elaborating its Eastern Caribbean Sub-Regional
Partnership Strategy for FY10–14, which is scheduled to be presented to the Board of the
Bank in May 2010. The interventions elaborated on below were launched under the Bank’s
Eastern Caribbean Sub-Region Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) for FY06–09. The
FY06-09 strategy supported the sub-region’s development agenda through two main pillars:
(1) stimulating growth and improving competitiveness; and (2) reducing vulnerability, by
promoting greater social inclusion and strengthening disaster risk management. Recognizing
the OECS countries’ weakened creditworthiness due to high debt ratios, Bank activities
focused on leveraging available donor grant financing. The OECS countries have confirmed
that the objectives under the FY06–09 Strategy remain relevant.
I. PROJECTS
There are six active World Bank projects in St. Lucia for a net commitment of approximately
US$27.84 million.
The OECS E-Government for Regional Integration Program was approved by the Board
on May 27, 2008. This project consists of a US$2.4 million IDA credit (two thirds of which
is from the Latin America and Caribbean Regional IDA allocation) to St. Lucia and is
designed to promote the efficiency, quality, and transparency of public services through the
delivery of regionally integrated e-government applications that take advantage of economies
of scale. The program is structured in phases. Phase 1 focuses on cross-sectoral
e-government issues, as well as on specific applications in the public finance area (including
Public Financial Management or PFM, tax, customs and procurement), and also includes an
e-government in health pilot project (possibly together with preparatory and complementary
activities in other social and productive sectors). Subsequent phases of the program are
expected to deepen the assistance provided under Phase 1, while expanding the program to
cover other sectors, in particular, health, education, agriculture, tourism, postal, among others
that may emerge during the early stages of implementation of Phase 1. The Commonwealth
of Dominica, Grenada, St. Vincent and the Grenadines now participate in this program.
The OECS (LC) Skills for Inclusive Growth project was approved in May 2007 for
US$3.5 million of IDA credit. The objective of the project is to assist the Government of
St. Lucia to increase the employability of youth through private-sector driven training. This
objective will be pursued through three means: (i) establishment of a competitive training
scheme that finances private sector-driven training and traineeships, (ii) development of an
improved policy framework for delivering training by enhancing OECS collaboration in
training and introducing occupational standards to increase quality and value of training, and
(iii) strengthening institutional capacity to better implement, monitor, and plan training.

5

The OECS Catastrophe Risk Insurance Facility (CCRIF) was approved in January 2007.
This is the world’s first ever multi-country catastrophe insurance pool. The Bank approved a
US$4.5 million IDA credit for St. Lucia to finance their contribution to the fund over three
years. The CCRIF will enable governments to participate in a joint reserve mechanism which
effectively gives coverage akin to business interruption insurance against adverse natural
events on a catastrophic scale, such as a major earthquakes or hurricanes. The CCRIF allows
participating countries to pool their country-specific risks into one, better-diversified
portfolio, resulting in a substantial reduction in the premium cost of 45–50 percent.
The Telecommunications and ICT Development Project, approved in May 2005 for
US$543,000, half coming from IBRD loans and the other half from IDA credit, aims at
improving the access, quality, and use of telecommunications and ICT services to achieve
socio-economic development in the Organization of Eastern Caribbean States (OECS). The
project has four components: (1) strengthening the national and regional regulatory
frameworks and promoting additional competition in the telecommunications sector.
Emphasis will be given to capacity building of Eastern Caribbean Telecommunications
Authority (ECTEL) and the National Telecommunications Regulatory Commissions
(NTRCs) by providing them with assistance to: (1) revise the regional and national sector
legislation, and develop a modem interconnection regime; (2) review current universal access
policy, create related guidelines, and provide financial support to establish a Universal
Service Fund (USF); (3) improve growth and competitiveness in ICT-enabled services
through utilization of broadband infrastructure; and (4) ensure management and
administration of the overall project.
The HIV/AIDS Prevention and Control Project was approved in July 2004 for
US$6.4 million, with half the financing through IBRD loans and the other half from IDA
credit. The project supports the national program, which aims to prevent and control the
spread of the epidemic, and to mitigate the socio-economic impact of the disease on the
population. The project will use a two-pronged strategy: targeting interventions at high risk
groups, and implementing non-targeted activities for the general population. The first
component—Community and Civil Society Initiatives—will finance HIV/AIDS prevention,
care, and support activities of Civil Society Organizations, women's organizations,
professional organizations, trade unions, and private sector organizations. The second
component will support the response to HIV/AIDS by non-health sector line ministries,
namely, basic cross-cutting HIV/AIDS activities which all ministries are expected to
implement under their respective sectoral HIV/AIDS programs. The third component will
strengthen the capacity of the Ministry of Health to provide technical guidance for the
national response to HIV/AIDS, specifically it will strengthen HIV/AIDS related services for
prevention, treatment, and care delivered through the health care system. Finally, the fourth
component will help build the institutional capacity for scaling up responsiveness, by
financing technical advisory services, training, staffing, equipment, goods, and general
operating costs.

6

The St. Lucia Disaster Management Project II was approved in June 2004 for
US$7.5 million and consists of US$3.8 million in IDA credit, and US$3.7 million from the
IBRD. This project aims at further reducing the country's vulnerability to adverse natural
events (hurricane, floods, etc.) through investment in risk management activities. The
project’s four components are: Component (1) Physical Prevention and Mitigation Work:
(a) coastal protection works for Dennery Village; (b) rehabilitation and reconstruction of two
bridges; (c) drainage, river walls and slope stabilization; (d) retrofitting of schools and health
centers; (e) procurement of additional stock; (f) technical audits for works at Dennery
Village; (g) training and capacity building. Component (2) Strengthening Emergency
Preparedness and Response: (a) construction of the Emergency Operations Center and
additional satellite warehouses; (b) installation of water tanks; (c) technical assistance and
training for the National Emergency Management Office; (d) specialized disaster equipment.
Component 3) Institutional Strengthening: (a) building code training and sensitization;
(b) technical assistance in territorial planning; (c) vulnerability assessment. Component 4)
Project Management: (a) technical assistance to the Project Coordination Unit and technical
audits.
II. ECONOMIC AND SECTOR WORK
The Bank has completed a series of analytical studies relating to public sector capacity in the
OECS including a number of Public Expenditure Reviews, an Institutional and
Organizational Capacity Review and, in late 2007, a Country Fiduciary Assessment. The
Bank also prepared an OECS study on Growth and Competitiveness (2005), an OECS Skills
Enhancement Policy Note (2006), a Caribbean Air Transport Report (2006), and a regional
study on Crime, Violence, and Development: Trends, Costs, and Policy Options in the
Caribbean (2007). In addition, an OECS Private Sector Financing Study and the OECS
Tourism Backward Linkages Study were completed in 2008. The publication
“Caribbean-Accelerating Trade Integration: Policy Options for Sustained Growth,
Job Creation and Poverty Reduction” was released in the Summer of 2009.
St. Lucia will also benefit from ongoing and planned analytical and advisory activities
including the following: a CARICOM study on Managing Nurse Migration and a preparatory
study aimed at developing a Caribbean-wide Regional Energy Strategy.

Appendix III. St. Lucia: Relations with the Caribbean Development Bank
(As of December 31, 2009)
CDB has sought to support its borrowing member countries to improve economic growth,
reduce poverty, pursue inclusive development and improve governance. Approximately
USD330.9mn has been approved to St. Lucia cumulatively in loans, contingent loans, equity
and grants from 1970 to 2009. Of this amount, USD175 mn were approved from Ordinary
Capital Resources with the remainder being sourced from the “soft” window. Table 1 is a
summary of the cumulative sectoral distribution of CDB approved assistance to St. Lucia
over the period. Prior to 2008 CDB support to St. Lucia has largely being through loans for
capital projects or through lines of credit, while additional support through grants and loans
has been given for institutional strengthening. In 2006, CDB in recognition of the changing
environment in which its borrowing member countries operate, diversified its loan offering to
include policy-based loans. St. Lucia has benefited from this and in 2008, CDB approved a
policy-based loan to GOSL of USD30mn (USD12mn from CDB’s Special Funds Resources
and USD18mn from CDB’s Ordinary Capital Resources). The PBL is intended to support
reforms aimed at improving public sector management as one component of the overall
macroeconomic programme of GOSL to achieve more balanced growth across the island,
raise employment levels and reduce poverty. During 2008 CDB also approved a loan of
USD12.0mn for the enhancement of basic education through infrastructure development and
institutional strengthening, while grants approved during that year amounted to USD79,000.
Total financing approved by the CDB amounted to USD20.8mn in 2009, of which
USD20.0mn was with respect to a line of credit for education, while grants amounted to
USD165,000.

Appendix IV. St. Lucia: Statistical Issues
(As of February 18, 2010)
Data provision has some shortcomings, but is broadly adequate for surveillance. Although
the statistical database compares well with those of its Eastern Caribbean Central Bank
(ECCB) peers, the accuracy and timeliness of macroeconomic statistics should be improved
in order to achieve adequate standards for Fund surveillance and meet the authorities’ needs.
There are persistent weaknesses in coverage, frequency, quality, and timeliness, in particular
regarding the national accounts, data on the public sector beyond the central government, and
the balance of payments. Also, comprehensive and regular labor statistics are not available.
The Ministry of Finance, Economic Affairs, and National Development publishes bi-annually
an economic and social review, which includes statistics on many macroeconomic sectors.
The ECCB publishes a quarterly economic and financial review and an annual balance of
payments for each member country.
St. Lucia is a participant in the General Data Dissemination System (GDDS). Its metadata,
which include detailed plans for statistical development in the main macroeconomic areas
over the short and medium term, have been posted on the Fund’s Dissemination Standards
Bulletin Board (http://dsbb.imf.org) since September 21, 2000.
Real Sector Statistics
The authorities are revising GDP estimates to obtain better sectoral estimates, and the process
is expected to be concluded this year. Attempts are being made to compile quarterly GDP
estimates with funding from the Organization of American States. Given the increasing
importance of tourism activities, a new comprehensive survey of the sector is necessary to
establish key data, such as the average length of stay in different types of accommodations
and the average daily expenditure by type of tourist arrival. This information should be
crosschecked with other related activities (i.e., restaurants and transportation) to ensure
consistency. Missions fielded by the Caribbean Regional Technical Assistance Center in the
past few years aided development of export and import price indices and initial work on
measuring price developments in the tourism sector. The rebasing exercise of the CPI has
been completed—the new CPI basket (base January 2008) is based on the 2006 Household
Expenditure Survey. Another area in need of improvement is labor statistics, in particular, the
reporting of private and public employment and wages.
Government Finance Statistics
Reporting of central government data has improved substantially over the last few years, but
deficiencies remain in the rest of the public sector. The authorities are reporting monthly data
on the central government’s current revenue and expenditure, using a Fund-compatible

11

economic classification, with lags of a couple of months. However, frequent and substantial
revisions suggest that there is a need for further refinement. With regard to the rest of the
public sector, the periodicity and timeliness of data reporting should be improved. Data on
domestic debt of the public sector are not available on a regular basis. No fiscal data are
reported to STA for publication in the GFS Yearbook or in IFS.
Monetary and Financial Statistics
Monetary statistics are compiled and reported to the Fund by the ECCB on a monthly basis
based on a standardized report form since July 2006. In April 2007 a data ROSC mission
assessed the monetary statistics with reference to the GDDS, and the Data Quality
Assessment Framework (DQAF, July 2003). It indicated that the institutional coverage of the
other depository corporations is incomplete, as data for mortgage companies, finance
companies, building societies, and credit unions—all of which accept deposits—are
excluded. Also, accrued interest is not incorporated in the value of the interest-bearing assets
and liabilities, and valuation adjustments are included in other liabilities. In addition, source
data for the commercial banks do not provide the disaggregation recommended in the
Monetary and Financial Statistics Manual. Close coordination between the ECCB and the
single regulatory unit (which supervises financial corporations other than those licensed
under the Banking Act) is crucial.
Balance of Payments Statistics
Balance of payments data are compiled by the ECCB on an annual basis. Although recent
data provide a more detailed breakdown of goods than in the past, in other areas they do not
provide sufficient detail to enable publication of the full classification used in the fifth edition
of the Balance of Payments Manual. Annual data up to 2008 are published in the IFS. In
general, enhanced data resources and better compilation procedures are needed to improve
the accuracy and timeliness of balance of payments statistics. Efforts should also be made to
compile quarterly balance of payments statistics and the annual international investment
position statement.
External Debt
The Ministry of Finance has a comprehensive database for public and publicly guaranteed
external loans that provides detailed and reasonably up-to-date breakdowns of disbursements
and debt service. Information on bonds placed abroad is compiled annually and monthly data
are provided only at the staff’s request. There is a need to restore the quality of information
on these bonds, which has weakened recently as the distinction between resident and
nonresident holders was discontinued.

Statement by Mr. O’Sullivan, Alternate Executive Director for St. Lucia
March 15, 2010

The authorities of St. Lucia wish to thank the staff for an insightful report. They wish to
place on the record their appreciation of the warm spirit of collaboration on the part of staff
during the consultations. The authorities agree with the thrust of the policy recommendations.
They share fully the concerns expressed about debt sustainability although in that context,
they would have welcomed more attention in the report on the growth side of the debt ratio
equation. That said, they consider that the staff report accurately identifies and describes in a
balanced way the principal economic challenges facing St. Lucia.
Economic management in an uncertain environment
St. Lucia is attempting to manage the difficult transition from an agricultural economy
largely dominated by a single product to a more modern economy based mainly on higher
value services, notably tourism. Reasonable progress was being achieved on that front prior
to the global crisis. The negative impact of the hurricane of August 2007 and the earthquake
which occurred later that year notwithstanding, the St Lucian economy had been expanding
at an annual rate of around 4 percent pre-crisis. During that period, significant resources were
committed to enhancing the quality of the country’s infrastructure and, supported by heavy
foreign direct investment, there was a marked expansion in tourism capacity. While the main
focus in the recent consultations was necessarily on fiscal issues, the authorities would
welcome engagement with the Fund on a theme which featured prominently in previous
consultations, namely, the challenge of raising the country’s growth potential. The general
case for continued structural reforms, including enhancing the business environment, is well
understood but closer engagement would be welcome on the identification of specific
measures to make public investment more productive, to diversify the tourist product and to
leverage the benefits of regional integration and the potential of the St. Lucian diaspora.
The series of external shocks which have buffeted the region over the last few years have
again underlined the difficulties inherent in managing small extremely open economies in a
turbulent environment. In addition to the inherently unpredictable events of recent years, the
economic environment for the region is changing in a more measured way, as recently
evidenced by the signing of the OECS Economic Union Treaty. The deepening of regional
integration is a positive development for ECCU countries. The commitment of the
authorities through the region to this endeavor can be seen from the willingness of a number
of countries, including St Lucia, to hold their recent SDR allocations as pooled reserves in
order to improve regional liquidity.

2

Recent economic and fiscal developments
The economic outturn for 2009 was significantly worse than forecast at the time of the
RAC-ESF discussions last July. At that time, the staff expectation was for a fall in output of
2.5 percent. It is now estimated by staff that the contraction in output was more than twice
that, at 5.2 percent and unemployment rose to over 20 percent by end-year.
The sharp downturn in the economy impacted fiscal developments. As discussed below, the
deficit on a cash basis for FY 2009/10 is now expected to be 6.1 percent of GDP as compared
with the scaled-back mid-year objective of 2.9 percent. Interestingly, this deterioration is
more than fully due to lower-than-expected revenue and grants, at 29.7 percent of GDP
compared with the mid-2009 expectation of 33.9 percent of GDP. Expenditure was contained
within target. Wages and salaries were marginally lower than targeted in mid-2009 as also
were interest payments. Total current expenditure came in 1.4 percentage points below the
mid-year expectation at 25.3 percent of GDP. On the capital side, the outturn was 0.4 percent
higher than the mid-year goal at 10.5 percent of GDP. Thus, the increase of 3 percentage
points in the planned fiscal deficit on a cash basis was due to a fall in receipts of 4 percentage
points which was partially offset by bringing spending in 1 percentage point below the
revised mid-year target.
Countervailing measures adopted by the authorities in 2009
In common with other countries in the region, St. Lucia is struggling to maintain the fabric of
its main source of growth, tourism, in the face of what will hopefully prove to be a temporary
decline in the demand for its product. The tourism industry generates almost four-fifths of
export receipts and is the principal driver of activity in the construction sector. In 2009, the
authorities were concerned not only to mitigate the impact of the sharp reduction in external
demand on employment in the tourism sector but also to address the risk that some of the
recent expansion in tourism capacity might have been lost unless establishments succeed in
riding out the crisis. The authorities’ response to this concern was to agree with the industry
to defer some tax payments which would have been due in the current fiscal year to
FY 2010/2011. This contributed to the widening of the fiscal deficit as compared with what
was envisaged in mid-2009. This was a one-off cash-flow concession to the industry, not a
tax cut. The sums deferred from the current fiscal year will fall due for payment in the fiscal
year commencing 1 April 2010, along with taxes due in the normal course thus helping to
reduce the fiscal deficit.
As noted in the staff report, the authorities also delivered an expenditure-side response to the
deteriorating economic situation by advancing a number of capital projects. This served the
dual purpose of addressing infrastructural advances needed for tourism purposes and
providing public works-based relief.

3

Fiscal outturn for 2009/10
The staff report emphasises the divergence between the likely fiscal outturn for the year
ended March 2010 and that which was expected when the RAC-ESF discussions were taking
place some three months into the fiscal year.
The authorities acknowledge that the emerging deficit for FY 2009/10, at 6.1 percent of
GDP, will be roughly double the level envisaged in the Letter of Intent dated July 7 2009.
They consider, however, that over and above the direct impact of the fall in output on
revenues and expenditure, additional supportive measures were needed. They would recall
that the original budget projection for the current fiscal year was for a deficit of 6.9 percent
of GDP so the expected cash outturn at 6.1 percent will actually be within the original target.
Looking at the emerging outturn from an accruals standpoint, the inclusion of the additional
1.7 percent of GDP in respect of the public works delivered through However, from an
accruals standpoint, the tax concession granted to the tourism operators whereby tax
payments which were due this year have been deferred into the coming fiscal year is an offset
against that. The broad picture, therefore, is that in a worse-than-expected economic
environment, the underlying budgetary outturn for FY 2009/10 will be close to that originally
planned.
Looking back on the fiscal year just ending, the conclusion has to be that with hindsight and
given the sharper-than-expected downturn in the economy, the goal of trimming the planned
budget deficit from the 6.9 percent of GDP envisaged in April 2009 to the objective of
2.9 percent of GDP just three months later was over-ambitious but that, clearly, the emerging
deficit is excessively high and steps are required to deliver a primary balance which will
generate a steady downward path in the level of debt towards a more sustainable level.
That said, the authorities agree fully with staff that budget deficits at the level observed in
FY 2009/10 and the accompanying sharp increase in the debt ratio simply cannot be
sustained. They concur with the Fund view that an exit strategy centered on a sustainable
primary budget setting is essential and they consider that the staff’s assessment of the
appropriate budgetary target is reasonable. The authorities reiterate their commitment to the
regional goal of bringing the debt ratio to below 60 percent by 2020 though they would
reiterate that, as for other countries in the region, the realisation of this objective by the date
envisaged will depend not only on their own fiscal policy efforts but also on a reasonably
healthy external economic environment and on efforts to enhance growth potential.
Ensuring fiscal and debt sustainability
The authorities intend to ground fiscal policy on the delivery of a primary balance which will
place debt on a more sustainable trajectory. They continue to subscribe to the common

4
regional goal in that respect. While broadening the base for economic growth will require
significant public capital spending over the medium-term, the authorities will keep capital
spending to a realistic and fiscally responsible level. They underline the importance for
attracting foreign direct investment and the need for good quality physical capital
infrastructure. The authorities also recognise that the capital expenditure program must be
phased carefully to reduce the risk of encountering capacity constraints and thereby
dissipating scarce resources through cost inflation in certain sectors. They see a need to
improve their capacity for project appraisal. Investment decisions must be taken on the basis
of a reliable appraisal of the prospective public return on the investments.
The Prime Minister, in his Letter of Intent of July 7 last, reconfirmed plans to introduce a
value added tax in the course of 2010. During the course of the consultations, he reiterated
that goal. Technical work and public communications are continuing in parallel with a view
to achieving that objective. The authorities are fully convinced of the potential of a VAT
system for strengthening the revenue base and thereby contributing to the debt sustainability
goal. They recommitted during the consultations to the debt sustainability target and the
specific measures to that end set out by the Prime Minister in his Letter of Intent. They view
the prospective outturn for the current fiscal year as an unavoidable but temporary departure
from the envisaged path which was essentially generated by the force of external
circumstances but which nonetheless needs to be reversed.
Financial and external stability
The authorities acknowledge the financial sector vulnerabilities highlighted by staff. They are
addressing these issues in conjunction where necessary with other countries in the region
which have also been impacted by the BAICO/CLICO events. As noted in the staff report,
they are coordinating with other ECCB countries on legislation for improving the supervision
of the nonbank financial sector. To that end, they have progressed the passing of the
Financial Services Regulatory Act to bring non-banking institutions within a common
regulatory and supervisory framework. They expect to complete on time the signing of the
Tax Information Exchange Agreements in relation to offshore financial center activity but
they also intend to assess the costs and benefits to St Lucia of that particular sector. Finally,
the authorities will monitor closely the trend in NPLs which, as staff points out, has been
deteriorating and which could be understated by the headline figures due to the granting in
some cases of moratoria on principal payments.
St Lucia’s external balance remains reasonably sound. The exchange rate is at or around the
level implied by the fundamentals. The large current account deficit is largely financed by
direct private capital inflows. The global downturn is impacting the current account balance,
however, and not just through its impact on regional tourist numbers. St Lucia is under
pressure to retain its market share and the return per visitor has been falling recently due to
heavy discounting in the industry and lower spending per visitor. Remittances from the
diaspora are under pressure due to economic pressures elsewhere.
