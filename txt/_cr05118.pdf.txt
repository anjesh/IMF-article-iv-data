EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
Since the mid-1990s, Canada has benefited from a strong institutional framework and
continuing structural reforms. Inflation targeting, an objective of balanced budget or better
for the federal budget, and structural reforms have yielded an enviable macroeconomic
performance, including the fastest growth rate and the strongest budget position in the G-7.
The outlook for the economy is broadly favorable, but external developments are creating
uncertainties. After a series of shocks in 2003, the economy rebounded over the last year.
Looking forward, indicators point to a sustained expansion in 2005. However, the recent
further appreciation of the exchange rate, uncertainty about the strength of net exports, and
commodity price volatility complicate the situation, as does the low household saving rate.
The Bank of Canada appears to have room to maintain a patient and measured approach
to withdrawing stimulus. The Bank has appropriately started to increase interest rates and
further interest rate hikes will likely be needed. At the same time, the risks to the outlook, the
absence of wage pressures, and anchored inflation expectations warrants a cautious and
pragmatic approach to tightening.
Recent agreements with the provinces have all but removed room for fiscal maneuver.
Given the very limited room, it will be important to weigh carefully the merits of spending
programs versus further reducing the relatively high tax burden. The new objective of
lowering the federal debt-to-GDP ratio to 25 percent within ten years adds a welcome anchor
to the fiscal framework that can help prepare for the fiscal challenges of aging.
More needs to be done to ensure the sustainability and efficiency of the health care system.
The major challenge will be to improve the system’s efficiency, including through measures
that improve incentives for both health care providers and consumers. While the
responsibility for such reforms lies at the provincial level, it is important that a diversity of
provincial strategies to control costs and reform public systems are encouraged.
The demographic shift and the ongoing challenges from increasingly globalized markets
underscore the importance of further structural reforms. Recent policies have laid a solid
foundation for future growth and created a favorable environment for business, but more can
be done to lower the tax burden, minimize disincentives from social transfers, and reduce
barriers to trade and competition.
Further reforms to Canada’s sound financial system could promote flexibility in a rapidly
changing global environment. The financial system remains sound, supported by the
economic recovery and buoyant financial markets. Reforms could include further clarifying
the regulatory framework governing bank mergers, adopting a single national securities
regulator, and harmonizing regulation of defined benefit pension plans.

I. INTRODUCTION
1.
Canada has grown rapidly over the last decade, although last year’s consultation
occurred against a challenging macroeconomic environment. Since the mid-1990s, Canada
has benefited from a strong institutional framework and continuing structural reforms—
consistently supported by the staff—that have yielded the fastest growth rate among major
industrial countries (Box 1 and Table 1). However, in 2003, a series of unexpected shocks
that largely affected the external sector—including a case of BSE and exchange rate
appreciation—weighed heavily on activity.
2.
The economy rebounded over the last year. Until recently, net exports provided
significant support to an economy in which domestic demand has also continued to grow
robustly. With capacity constraints a factor, the Bank of Canada has appropriately started to
withdraw stimulus at a measured pace. Despite a number of new spending measures, the
recovery and the prudent fiscal framework have again delivered budgetary surpluses.
3.
The outlook for the Canadian economy is broadly favorable, but external
developments are creating significant uncertainties.1 Indicators point to a sustained
recovery in activity, supported by a pickup in investment, rising personal incomes, and
buoyant profits. However, the recent further appreciation of the exchange rate, uncertainty
about the underlying strength of net exports, and commodity price volatility complicate the
outlook, underlining the importance of external shocks for an open economy whose exports
are concentrated on the U.S. market and contain a high proportion of commodities.
4.
Against this background, the mission focused on sustaining a balanced recovery
and boosting labor productivity and flexibility:
•

Macroeconomic policies. In considering the pace of monetary tightening, the Bank of
Canada will need to weigh carefully risks to the outlook and the absence of wage and
price pressures against indications that slack is limited, while the fiscal authorities
face the challenge of maintaining the social consensus for surpluses and sustained
debt reduction.

•

Structural policies. With rapid but relatively labor-intensive growth in recent years,
significant external shocks, and questions about the sustainability of the public health
care system, the team focused on policies to raise underlying labor productivity
growth and economic flexibility, reduce pressures on public health spending, and
further strengthen Canada’s strong institutional framework.

Box 1. Canada’s Performance in International Context
A sound institutional framework and structural reforms have led to an enviable macroeconomic and
fiscal performance since the mid-1990s. The macroeconomic framework has rested on inflation
targeting and a federal fiscal commitment to balanced budgets or better. Structural reforms included
reforms of the Employment Insurance system, tax cuts, and trade liberalization.
Since 1995, Canada’s real GDP has expanded at the fastest rate among the G-7 (Table). Real GDP
growth averaged 3½ percent a year over this period—2½ percent on a per capita basis. As a result,
income differentials (using purchasing parity exchange rates) have narrowed with respect to the United
States and remained above the rest of the G-7.
Canada has also recorded the strongest fiscal performance in the G-7 over the same period. Canada
was the only major industrial country to record a surplus on the general government accounts in 2003.
More generally, since 1995, the general government budget has been in balance on average, contributing
to a reduction in the general government net debt ratio of about 35 percentage points of GDP. This has
moved Canada’s net debt ratio from second highest to the lowest within the G-7.1

Canada’s gross general government debt is significantly higher than net debt, but the difference largely reflects
commercial securities that earn markets rates of return, making net debt a better gauge of the fiscal position.

II. RECENT DEVELOPMENTS
5.
General elections in June 2004 led to the formation of a minority government.
Following Paul Martin’s appointment as Prime Minister in December 2003, the Liberal party
won its fourth consecutive election but lost the parliamentary majority it had held since 1993.
The new government subsequently laid out an ambitious policy agenda, that included
commitments to invest in people, encourage innovation, improve the regulatory environment,
support regional and sectoral development, and

6.
The economy regained traction in the
latter half of 2003, but momentum has
moderated more recently (Table 2). In 2003, the
economy was hit by exchange rate appreciation,
a SARS outbreak, forest fires, a large power
outage, and a case of “mad cow” disease that
significantly reduced agricultural exports. Real
GDP fell in the second quarter of 2003, but has
rebounded, growing at an annual rate of
3 percent over the next five quarters. Later in
2004, however, as the Canadian dollar again
appreciated, there was a rapid slowing of net
exports.

•

Household consumption has remained
robust. Spending has been supported by
strong employment gains and increases in
net wealth. However, the household
saving rate has dropped to zero and debt
has risen to over 100 percent of
disposable income.
Business investment has responded to
strong corporate earnings, low interest
rates, and cheaper capital equipment
imports. Corporate profits rose

in machinery and equipment, some
80 percent of which is imported.
•

Low interest rates continue to
benefit residential investment.
Residential mortgage loans have
increased at an annual rate of
9 percent since mid-2003,
accompanied by similarly strong
growth in construction activity.
Although house prices have
increased by around 7 percent per
year, real values are still recovering
from a decade-long slump and do
not appear out of line with
fundamentals.2

8.
Net exports, which provided an
unexpected boost in the first half of 2004,
are weakening (Table 3). Export volumes
rebounded strongly from early 2003,
despite the appreciation of the Canadian
dollar, in part reflecting strong U.S. private
investment and robust demand for nonoil
commodities, while the terms of trade
further supported the current account.
Beginning in the third quarter of 2004,
however, exports retreated and the
contribution of net exports to GDP growth
turned sharply negative. With import
demand growing strongly and commodity
prices falling from recent highs, the trade
surplus has narrowed but remains well
above 5 percent of GDP.
9.
After giving up some recent gains
earlier in 2004, the Canadian dollar has
appreciated rapidly since mid-year. The
Canadian dollar strengthened by almost
20 percent in real effective terms in 2003,
supported by weakness in the U.S. currency

and buoyant commodity prices. Its more recent appreciation—which is less easy to explain
based on domestic developments, and seems to largely reflect a correction of the overvalued
U.S. dollar—has taken the currency to its highest level against its U.S. counterpart since mid1992.3 Staff estimates suggest that the real exchange rate is now essentially consistent with
underlying fundamentals.
10.
The rebound in growth has
reduced economic slack. Industrial capacity
utilization rose to 85.7 percent in the third
quarter, above its 2000 peak, but does not
appear to be generating significant
constraints except in some commodityproducing industries. Staff estimates the
output gap at about ½ percent of GDP, with
potential output growth at around 3 percent
a year.
11.
Wage pressures have yet to emerge,
possibly reflecting the strong rise in labor
supply. There has been a sharp increase in
the participation ratio over recent years,
which remains close to a record high as the
economy continues to absorb increasing
numbers of female and elderly workers into
the labor force, apparently reflecting greater
labor force attachment associated with
rising education levels across cohorts. The
unemployment rate is now at 7 percent—
the staff’s estimate of the NAIRU—but
wage demands have been contained, and
unit labor costs are essentially flat.

Canadian labor productivity growth has lagged that
of the United States over the past 2-3 years.

Core inflation remains subdued. Year-on-year inflation rose to 2¼ percent (overall)
and 2 percent (core) in July, partly in response to higher energy and motor vehicle prices, but
the core rate fell to 1½ percent in November. Producer price inflation has also eased while
capital goods prices have benefited from exchange rate appreciation.
13.
With slack narrowing, the Bank of Canada started withdrawing monetary stimulus
in September and October but then paused in December. The Bank raised its target for the
overnight rate by 25 basis points in both September and October, to 2½ percent, and
suggested that further rate hikes would be needed to keep core inflation to 2 percent at end2005. However, while acknowledging that interest rates remain accommodative, the Bank

held rates steady in December, citing concerns about the impact of the exchange rate on
economic activity. Markets expect the pause to continue through the first half of next year.
14.
Fiscal surpluses have been maintained and debt continues to fall. The federal
budget surplus in FY 2003–04 (April to March) reached ¾ percent of GDP, well above
earlier estimates despite post-budget spending measures of ¼ percent of GDP. The
overachievement largely reflected tax revenue buoyancy, partly due to the rebound in activity
in late 2003. Provincial government finances deteriorated slightly but budgets in aggregate
remained close to balance, and the strength of federal finances left the general government
with a significant surplus.

III. THE SHORT-TERM OUTLOOK
16.
The staff expects growth to remain close to potential over the next year-and-a-half.
Domestic demand growth is expected to remain robust with real consumer demand and
investment growing at around 3 percent and 5 percent in 2005, respectively, supported by
relatively easy financial conditions. Business investment would also be spurred by increasing
capacity constraints and lower prices of imported machinery and equipment. However, the
appreciation of the Canadian dollar and weaker external demand are expected to continue to
depress exports. Growth is expected to be 3 percent in 2005, broadly consistent with private
sector and official projections.

17.
Officials and private sector analysts viewed the exchange rate as the principal risk
for the outlook. They noted that the vigor of net exports in the first half of 2004 had been
unusual given the strong exchange rate appreciation in 2003. The benign interpretation was
that Canadian industry had responded with increased flexibility and efficiency, but it was
also possible that adjustment had simply been delayed. Bank of Canada analysis suggested
the pickup in exports partly reflected a recovery to equilibrium. Since imports remain below
levels suggested by long-term fundamentals, there was a risk that net exports could weigh
heavily in the period ahead.
18.
Staff enquired whether the apparent
fall in exchange rate passthrough further
complicated the impact of exchange rate
movements on output and prices. They noted
that slower or more limited passthrough could
reduce the responsiveness of net exports to
changes in real exchange rates.4 Officials
responded that it was not clear-cut that
passthrough had fallen, with some indicators
suggesting that it might simply have been
delayed.

19.
Officials and the mission agreed that global demand conditions were a major
source of uncertainty. Since 85 percent of Canadian exports were destined for the United
States, a key risk was that higher oil prices could cool U.S. growth or that monetary
tightening would weigh on U.S. auto and housing markets and, in turn, Canadian
manufacturing and lumber exports. Officials also noted that—despite modest direct trade
links—China and India were of growing relevance for the Canadian economy through global
commodity markets and third countries.
20.

Canadian forecasters saw limited risks to domestic demand:

•

The domestic impact of high oil prices was characterized as broadly neutral. Higher
energy prices were seen as having a small negative impact in the short-term, mainly
through an erosion of real spending power. However, the long-term effect of higher
energy prices is likely beneficial given Canada’s substantial oil and natural gas
exports (Box 2).

•

Forecasters were relatively sanguine about household demand. Notwithstanding staff
concerns that the saving rate remains below equilibrium, official and private
forecasters downplayed the risk of an abrupt adjustment.5 They noted that debt
service burdens remained manageable, lower interest rate volatility has reduced
balance-sheet risk, and financial institutions had limited exposure to the housing
sector.

•

Investment provided an upside potential. Officials painted an upbeat picture for
prospects in the energy and mining sectors, and agreed with the staff that high
corporate profitability, limits to further increases in labor participation, and exchange
rate appreciation were conducive to capital accumulation.

21.
Officials acknowledged that Canada’s outlook and policy making was complicated
by uncertainties regarding the growth of potential output. Recent revisions to Canadian and
U.S. data, which eliminated the labor-productivity growth differential for the decade ending
in 2002, suggested a less worrisome picture of the supply side of the economy, but the sharp
increase in the participation ratio over the last decade further complicated assessments of
potential output and the output gap.6

See “Canadian Household Saving” in Canada: Selected Issues IMF Country Report 04/60, 2004.

International evidence suggests participation rates are negatively correlated with the measured level of
productivity (see The Sources of Economic Growth in OECD Countries, OECD: Paris, 2003).

Box 2: The Effect of Oil Price Fluctuations on the Canadian Economy
Oil price changes are generally viewed as broadly neutral for the Canadian economy. Even though Canada
is a relatively oil-intensive economy, it is the ninth largest crude oil exporter in the world and has the second
largest potential oil reserves.
Simulations using GEM, the Fund’s new multi-country model, suggest that a hike in oil and natural gas
prices (hereafter, simply oil prices) modestly dampens activity in Canada in the short-term.1 An oil price
increase reduces domestic spending by

benefits allow domestic spending to increase by
more.
Oil price hikes also have pronounced regional
effects, benefiting the resource-rich west and
hurting the central and some Atlantic provinces
(Chart and Table). Oil production is concentrated
in the prairie provinces, in particular Alberta. By
contrast, higher oil prices raise energy costs for
the central provinces—Ontario and Quebec—that
are the manufacturing heart of the economy and
produce 70 percent of Canada’s GDP. These
differences in growth would be exacerbated by
any associated exchange rate appreciation.

Bank of Canada officials and staff agreed that further withdrawals of stimulus
would be needed at some point. Officials noted that real interest rates were well below

on external demand, suggested a measured

authorities agreed that these factors—as well as the adjustment costs from moving resources

appreciation and commodity prices—argued for a measured approach to tightening. They

- 14 -

noted that future interest rate moves would be determined by evolving prospects for capacity
and inflation and would be played “quarter-by-quarter.”7
25.
Officials noted that measures of economic slack provided important input into
monetary policy decisions. At the same time, however, the 2003 experience—when capacity
indicators supported a tightening of policy that had to be reversed as activity slowed
unexpectedly—had underscored the substantial uncertainty that surrounded both the nature
of, and the economy’s response to, macroeconomic shocks. Officials agreed that these
uncertainties argued for a more gradual interest rate response to overall conditions than
otherwise. They noted that the exchange rate was a major source of unpredictability for the
outlook, and hence monetary policy, but emphasized that, given the wide range of potential
shocks driving currency movements, the Bank no longer focused on the mechanistic
monetary conditions index as a guide for policy.
26.
Private sector participants and the team commended the Bank’s communication
strategy, which prepared markets well for the latest round of monetary tightening. Staff
welcomed the inclusion of more information on projections in recent Monetary Policy
Reports (MPRs), which had been recommended in last year’s consultation. However, they
suggested that a richer background on policymakers’ views could be provided, particularly at
fixed action dates not associated with an MPR or Update, possibly by publishing Governing
Council minutes. Officials were not convinced to publish minutes—given the Council’s
composition and legal framework, and the potential impact on candor—and suggested that
MPRs as well as speeches by Governing Council members were adequate conduits to
markets.8
27.
The authorities reiterated their ongoing commitment to flexible exchange rates, but
were concerned about spillovers from global current account imbalances. Bank officials
noted that, while the strengthening of the currency during 2003 was in line with Canada’s
fundamentals, including rapidly rising commodity prices, the recent further appreciation was
more difficult to explain. Against this background, they were concerned about international
imbalances, stressing that multilateral exchange rate adjustments to correct these imbalances
could be significant and place an inordinate burden on industrial countries with freelyfloating rates. They suggested that the Fund could usefully play more of a leadership role in
this area.

The Bank subsequently left rates on hold on December 7.

The Governor has legal responsibility for the conduct of monetary policy, although in practice decisions have
been delegated to the Bank’s Governing Council, which also includes the Senior Deputy Governor and the other
four Deputy Governors. The Reserve Bank of Australia, which has a similar structure, recently stopped the
release of Board minutes and voting records since 2003.

Box 3. Slack and Inflation
Monetary policy decisions are being complicated by uncertainty over the level of slack in the economy
and its implications for inflation. While core inflation remains below 2 percent, comparisons of real
output, unemployment, and—most notably—capacity utilization with historical trends suggest tightening
capacity constraints. This dichotomy could reflect lags between changes in slack and inflation, instability

V. SUSTAINABLE FISCAL POLICY
28.
Officials and staff concurred that the federal fiscal framework had delivered a
broad-based social consensus for fiscal prudence. The two-year rolling commitment to
budget balance or better had resulted in seven consecutive years of fiscal surpluses, reduced
federal net debt by almost 30 percent of GDP, and still afforded sizeable tax reduction. This

Officials noted that the FY 2004–05 Budget had reaffirmed the government’s
commitment to sound fiscal management and enshrined a debt-reduction target.9 The
budget had restored the economic prudence factor reduced in the previous year. The new
objective of lowering the federal debt ratio from 41 percent of GDP to 25 percent within ten
years provided a medium-term anchor to enhance fiscal credibility and promote recognition
of long-term demographic pressures.

relations with the provinces, recent federal-provincial agreements on health and equalization
had committed the federal government to increase transfers over an extended period, in order
to facilitate their long-term fiscal planning (Box 4). The latest Economic and Fiscal Update
illustrated that these measures had largely eliminated the planning surplus, which includes
the contingency reserve and prudence factor, over the coming two fiscal years.

31.
Staff and officials discussed the relative merits of adopting a five-year fiscal
planning horizon. Presently, officials explained, budget projections are presented for two
years, but given the recent medium-term spending commitments to provinces and the
importance of transparency regarding the longer-term impact of measures, a longer budget
horizon might be appropriate. The mission agreed, but cautioned against placing an undue
weight on the planning surpluses that were expected to re-emerge from FY 2007/08. In the
team’s view, uncertainties increase significantly with the forecast horizon and recent
medium-term spending commitments exposed the budget to increased cyclical risk (Box 5).
32.
The team noted that the ongoing Expenditure Review provided an opportunity for
the government to reassess its broader policy priorities. In particular, they suggested that
reallocating expenditure savings from the Review would provide an opportunity to weigh
carefully the merits of spending programs versus further reducing the relatively high tax
burden. Officials noted that the government placed a significant weight on expanding some
social transfers, but agreed that it was important to raise efficiency by maximizing the
productive use of the government’s scarce resources. Tax policy could be an important
element in this regard, and some officials saw scope for efficiency-enhancing boosts to
spending on federal infrastructure, for example, at border crossings. Finally, officials noted
that consideration was being given to establishing a process to review spending on a regular
basis.

- 18 -

Box 4: Recent Federal-Provincial Agreements
The federal government recently reached two key agreements that significantly raise transfers to the provinces
over the medium term and provide a more stable source of funding for individual provinces.
New Ten-Year Plan for Health Care
In September 2004, the federal government and provinces agreed to a 10-year plan to strengthen health
care. The federal government committed to boosting health care transfers to provinces by C$41 billion
(3 percent of 2004 GDP) over the next 10 years. This includes a 25 percent increase to Canada Health
Transfers in FY 2005–06 and a 6 percent subsequent escalator to provide predictable federal support to help
future planning by provinces. These increases went well beyond the recommendations of the earlier Romanow
report.
In common with previous agreements in 2000 and 2003, the new plan does not involve wide-ranging
reforms of health care delivery. In the latest agreement, provinces agreed to improving service quality,
accountability, and comparability by:
•
•
•
•
•

Reducing waiting times and improving access;
Increasing the supply of health care professionals;
Ensuring a minimum standard of home care;
Sharing best practices in primary care;
Developing a national pharmaceutical strategy.

New Framework for Equalization and Territorial Financing Formula (TFF)
In October 2004, First Ministers reached agreement on a new framework for the Equalization and related
programs that increase support to provinces and territories by $33 billion over the next 10 years. The
Equalization program allocates federal transfers to ensure that provincial revenues meet a minimum standard.
Currently, eight provinces receive funds. The new approach sets a minimum federal funding floor of
C$10.9 billion for Equalization and C$2 billion for TFF for the next two years, followed by a 3½ percent
growth in the base through FY 2009–10. The agreement also created a panel of experts charged with
recommending a new allocation mechanism across provinces with a mandate to:
•
•

Examine and evaluate alternative methods of measuring fiscal disparities across provinces and
territories;
Propose a new allocation mechanism that reduces uncertainty of transfers.

It is expected to report in late 2006, although the federal government retains full responsibility for decisions
upon consultation with provinces.

- 19 -

Box 5: Uncertainty in Budget Forecasting
Uncertainty around fiscal forecasts has been an increasingly important issue in Canada. The
government has a commitment to “balanced budget or better” in a framework that includes
contingency and prudential reserves and economic forecasts based on private sector input. This
framework has been associated with larger-than-expected budget surpluses in recent years which has
raised questions about the accuracy of fiscal forecasts.1 To provide further insight, staff used a vector
autoregression involving the budget deficit as a ratio to GDP, real GDP growth, inflation, changes in
the real exchange rate, and short- and long-term interest rates to examine the error bands around
budget forecasts.
Fiscal forecasts are subject to a wide range of

large enough to guarantee budget balance or better.

The government announced an independent review of the government’s economic and fiscal
forecast methods and requested staff to compared Canadian budgeting practices and experiences with
other industrial countries.

- 20 -

33.
Officials emphasized the long-term
challenges to fiscal balances posed by
population aging. Canada’s projected
increase in the old-age dependency ratio of
around 20 percentage points over the next
25 years was in the upper range of G-7
countries. Reforms had made the public
pension system actuarially sound, but
demographic factors would weigh on health
and other age-related public spending after
2010, raising concerns about the long-term
sustainability of government finances. The
mission noted that its analysis illustrated the
importance of continuing to keep the debtto-GDP ratio on a downward path over the
next decade and beyond for preparing
Canada for the long-term demographic
transition, but there was also a need to curb
cost increases in the health system.

Containing health costs and reducing debt are both
crucial to long-term fiscal sustainability.

In this context, officials and staff
agreed on the need for fundamental
reform to increase health-sector efficiency.
As in other industrial countries, health
spending has been rising at an unsustainable
pace, reflecting increased utilization of
health care services, population aging and
rapid technological innovation. Staff
suggested measures would be needed over
time to improve delivery of services and
curb demand, and that recent health
agreements had involved larger transfers to
provinces without fundamental reforms or a
hardening of budget constraints.

Methodological note: The baseline path reports projected
government debt ratios assuming that the federal government
achieves its ten-year debt reduction target, provinces run
approximately balanced budgets over the same period, that there
are no subsequent changes to tax rates, a fixed rate of increase in
spending programs, and annual excess health cost increases (i.e.
the degree to which health care cost increases exceed overall
inflation) is reduced to 2 percent per year. The "No debt-ratio
reduction" path adjusts the baseline by assuming that spending is
raised such that federal and provincial budgets are in deficit at a
level that allows the debt ratio to remain unchanged over the next
ten years, followed by no further changes to tax rates and the
same future rate of increase in spending programs. The "Annual

for health care and hence reforming the
system. Few federal restrictions were placed on provinces with regard to delivery of services,
and innovation in this area was welcome. However, they viewed curbing demand for core
services covered under the federal Canada Health Act through user fees as detrimental to
access by the poor. Recent agreements with the provinces had included mechanisms to

- 21 -

improve public comparability of health outcomes, which would facilitate consensus building
on future efforts. Staff noted that in earlier meetings, some provincial officials had expressed
frustration at prohibitions on user fees, but all had agreed on the central government’s role in
promoting common health care standards, priorities, and infrastructure.
36.
Officials observed that while the recent agreement on Equalization payments
provided reform opportunities, there was a risk of moving the system away from its
original intent. By largely fixing the overall size of future federal Equalization payments
over the next six years, officials noted that the agreement had eroded the underlying principal
that such payments compensated for differing fiscal capacity. This, as well as two provinces’
insistence that their resource revenues be exempted from the system, had increased the risk
such payments would be seen as an entitlement. Staff responded that a key challenge for the
upcoming review of the program’s allocation mechanism would be to design a system that
provided a transparent and equitable basis for payments across provinces, while avoiding the
year-to-year volatility of the previous system.
37.
Officials acknowledged that recent overshoots of projected federal budget surpluses
had raised questions about the credibility of the fiscal framework. This over-performance
was viewed as constraining the debate over how resources should be allocated between tax
cuts, expenditure increases, and debt reduction. In response, the government had
commissioned an independent assessment of Canada’s fiscal forecasting performance, in
which the staff had agreed to provide an international perspective.10 Senior officials stressed,
however, that the strong political and institutional commitment to balanced budgets remained
intact, and that the only question was the appropriate size and allocation of surpluses.
38.
Officials saw surpluses as posing growing challenges for debt management. With
new debt issuances projected to fall, it would become increasingly difficult to maintain
adequate liquidity in benchmark securities. A decision had been taken to maintain inflationadjusted bonds, which were popular with institutional investors, and increase the proportion
of short-term maturities to lower funding costs. Since short-term interest rates tended to be
correlated with revenues, overall fiscal risk would be lowered despite more volatile interest
payments. Staff observed that this would also tend to reduce the size of automatic stabilizers.
39.
The mission welcomed the government’s efforts to enhance Canada’s already high
level of fiscal transparency. Officials pointed to the recent reestablishment of the Office of
the Comptroller General as a key step to strengthen financial oversight across the federal
government. In addition, the latest Fiscal Update had added more detail on how fiscal
forecasts of private forecasters were converted to be consistent with the public accounts

VI. POLICIES TO INCREASE ECONOMIC EFFICIENCY AND FLEXIBILITY
40.
While Canada has been the fastest growing G-7 country since 1995, staff noted that
the sources of growth provided a less favorable picture. In particular, Canada’s strong
growth had resulted in large part from the sharp increase in the participation rate. Multifactor
productivity growth was comparable with that in other G-7 countries, while Canada’s ratio of
investment in machinery and equipment to GDP was low by international standards. With the
participation rate likely to stabilize at some point, this suggested that policies to help spur
productivity and investment would be needed to sustain Canada’s strong growth
performance. In addition, flexibility was also at a premium, given Canada’s openness and
resulting susceptibility to external shocks.11

A. Taxes, Spending, and Internal Trade
41.
Officials agreed with staff that there remains significant scope for efficiencyenhancing structural, tax, and regulatory reforms. The upcoming demographic shift and
growing challenges from increasingly global markets made improving labor productivity and
economic flexibility crucial for continued gains in standards of living. For this reason, the
2004 Budget had placed a priority on further boosting productivity and included measures to
promote investment, education, innovation, and basic infrastructure. At the same time, they
noted that recent tax cuts, reforms to the Employment Insurance (EI) system in the late
1990s, and trade liberalization in the context of NAFTA had already contributed to economic
efficiency and flexibility.

11

Following last year’s work on productivity (“The Canada-United States Productivity Gap” in IMF Country
Report 04/60), Chapter 5 in this year’s Selected Issues paper examines Canada’s economic flexibility.

- 23 -

42.
The mission pointed to the relatively high tax burden despite recent tax cuts at both
the federal and provincial level.12 Staff and officials agreed that, given the fiscal situation,
tax-reduction would need to be targeted to maximize social returns. The staff noted that the
welfare analysis contained in Finance Canada’s Tax Expenditure and Evaluations suggested
priority could be given to increasing incentives to invest and save. Options included aligning
depreciation allowances more closely with economic depreciation, eliminating provincial
capital taxes/sales taxes on inputs, and reducing taxes on capital income.
43.
Officials acknowledged that tax cuts in the United States and elsewhere increased
pressure on Canada to follow suit. Officials indicted that there was pressure to lower the
corporate tax rate, while the mission noted that reducing the gap in tax rates between large
and small enterprises could increase incentives to exploit advantages of scale and scope.13
While agreeing that recent (and proposed) U.S. tax cuts on saving could create pressure for
similar steps in Canada, officials suggested that enhancing tax-sheltered instruments could
help stimulate household saving, business investment, and productivity growth. They noted
that fairness as well as efficiency considerations were important in assessing such
instruments.
44.
The mission noted that the EI program remains an uneasy combination of
unemployment insurance and social assistance. Staff observed that recent changes to the
system had diluted reforms of the late 1990s, and suggested that future modifications
reinforce the program’s insurance principle by reducing social benefits (which could be
better funded through general revenues) and introducing experience rating of employers and
employees. Officials observed it had proven difficult to resist pressures to enrich benefits in
recent years but that structural and legal challenges could eventually prompt reforms.14
However, the immediate priority was on establishing a transparent system for setting
premiums so as to balance the system over the cycle and avoid procyclical adjustment.
45.
The mission suggested that reforms in other social programs could help increase
labor utilization and efficiency. Possible improvements included reducing incentives for
early retirement in the public pension system, such as those being proposed by the Quebec
Pension Plan (QPP), and by lowering “welfare walls” in the social transfer system. Officials
agreed that QPP proposals to make the system more actuarially fair and curb excessive use of
disability benefits could reduce disincentives for seniors to work, and that smoothing

A growing share of workers are ineligible for social assistance under EI (i.e., the self-employed, part-time, or
contractual workers), while a recent court ruling in Quebec had questioned the constitutionality of social
benefits under the program.

- 24 -

relatively effective marginal tax rates (EMTRs) at low income levels could improve labor
market outcomes, especially for lower-skilled workers. However, there was no easy solution
to high EMTRs, since they required either benefit reductions for low-income groups or
extending benefits for higher income groups at a significant fiscal cost.
46.
Officials explained that progress was being made toward facilitating internal trade.
The Agreement on Internal Trade (AIT) had become a priority of the Council of the
Federation, resulting in provincial accords on issues such as the dispute settlement process,
while further reforms to the AIT in agriculture, energy, and labor mobility were being
debated. The authorities also observed that significant restrictions remained in the area of
professional qualifications, particularly with regard to foreign workers.
47.
Officials noted that electricity reforms had slowed. Although provincial authorities
continued to seek private investments in the energy sector, Ontario’s decision to reverse
planned reforms to privatize part of its generating assets had been a backward step. In
addition, officials observed that reforms to enhance the reliability of the electricity system
had been slowed by the failure to approve an energy bill in the U.S. Congress, which would
set up an independent oversight board in Canada’s main trading partner.
48.
Officials explained that work on environmental regulations and legislation in
pursuit of the Kyoto Protocol was well underway. Guidelines for emissions-intensity targets
and legislation to deal with large final emitters would be in place by spring 2005, including
financial sanctions for transgressors. An emissions trading mechanism was expected to be
operational in 2008.
B. Financial Sector Policies
49.
Officials expressed confidence in the stability of the financial system and
effectiveness of the prudential and supervisory system. The banking and insurance sectors
had posted strong performances in recent years, capital ratios were robust, and the system
was well positioned to respond to monetary tightening.15 On the regulatory front, officials
noted that the regular, five-year revision to financial services regulation would begin shortly,
and that consideration might be given to streamlining the roles of some agencies, where
responsibilities overlapped. Meanwhile, FINTRAC was continuing to implement earlier antimoney-laundering legislation. The authorities responded favorably to the staff’s suggestion
that an Update of the 2000 pilot FSAP would be useful, but requested details on the burden
this would entail.
50.
Staff noted that limited progress had been made in addressing regulatory issues
related to bank mergers and securities markets:
15

Chapters 6 and 7 of the Selected Issues paper analyze financial system soundness indicators and banking
efficiency, respectively.

- 25 -

•

Bank mergers. Officials acknowledged that progress had been slow in finalizing
financial sector consolidation policy in Canada, including in clarifying the “public
interest” criterion used for ministerial approval of bank mergers. A consultation
process had concluded by end-2003 and revised merger guidelines were to have been
issued in mid-2004. However, no new deadline had been set. Moreover, despite longstanding concerns that the present system impeded efficiency, officials noted that
Canadian banks were profitable and able to invest in expanded operations abroad.

•

Securities market regulation. The late-2003 report by a “Wise Persons Committee”
has called for the establishment of a single securities market regulator to reduce
compliance and administrative costs. However, while progress was being made on
coordinating provincial regulations, staff noted that unification at a more fundamental
level would be difficult to achieve in the face of continued opposition by most
provinces.

51.
Staff asked about the experience with tighter corporate governance, accounting,
and disclosure standards enacted in response to U.S. accounting scandals.16 Officials
responded that these initiatives had enhanced markets integrity and helped avoid regulatory
gaps with the United States. However, some officials and regulators felt that these measures
had followed U.S. legislation too closely and placed an excessive burden on small firms,
which were more prevalent in Canada. Similarly, mixed views were expressed on the related
issue of the benefits from further harmonizing Canada’s accounting practices with the U.S.
GAAP. While providing advantages for companies operating on both sides of the border,
officials observed that the U.S. rules were not always in keeping with Canada’s different
structure of corporate governance.
52.
Staff welcomed steps to harmonize regulation of defined benefit pension plans.
Plans are administered at both provincial and federal levels, and the Canadian Association of
Pension Supervisory Authorities (CAPSA) has recently issued for discussion a model law to
harmonize regulations and simplify disclosure and compliance. The team and regulators
agreed that, given underfunding issues, consideration could also be given to enhancing
incentives for funding, particularly in the light of recent court cases that had reduced
management’s control over the disposition of funds after partial windups.
C. Trade and International Assistance
53.
Officials welcomed the revival of the Doha Round negotiations in July 2004,
although key issues remained to be negotiated. On agriculture, Canada had agreed to the
eventual elimination of government schemes to guarantee export credits and underwrite the
losses of the Canadian Wheat Board (CWB). They were planning to maintain the CWB’s

These included a review of auditing practices; strengthened independence of board and audit committees;
increased disclosure standards; certification of financial statements by chief executive and financial officers;
increased transparency of financial statements; and stiffened penalties for corporate fraud.

- 26 -

monopoly status and, in common with many other countries, to ask for flexibility for certain
sectors, specifically those governed by supply-management schemes. Staff responded that, as
a major agricultural exporter, Canada had much to gain from the Doha round and that
reducing trade barriers in the supply-managed sectors could improve efficiency and support
an ambitious Doha outcome. Following the withdrawal of investment from the Doha Round
agenda, Canada intends to pursue its objectives through regional or bilateral initiatives.
54.
The authorities viewed Canada’s increasing pursuit of bilateral and regional free
trade agreements (RTAs) as complementary to their multilateral efforts. Staff pointed to
drawbacks of RTAs, including the scope for trade diversion; reduced incentives for
multilateral liberalization; and webs of overlapping and cumbersome administrative
provisions as RTAs multiply. The authorities acknowledged that the proliferation of disparate
RTAs could be seen as a concern, but did not view it as an obstacle to an ambitious
multilateral agreement. They pointed to the continued interest of Canada in the Doha process,
especially as key issues, such as agricultural subsidies, have remained outside the scope of
RTAs.
55.
In February 2004, Canada renewed its trade preference schemes for less developed
countries for a further ten years. The authorities contended, however, that such schemes
should be temporary, as their role was to provide breathing room to countries preparing their
export sectors for global competition. They added that multilateral trade liberalization would
in any case erode the value of such schemes in the medium term.
56.
While Canada’s focus remains on strengthening trade relations with the United
States, parallel efforts are underway to enhance access to other markets. Recent CanadaU.S. bilateral initiatives focused on responding to security concerns while ensuring the
smooth flow of goods and people across the common border. At the same time, parallel
efforts are underway to tap the significant export-growth potential, particularly in large
emerging markets such as Brazil, China, and India.
57.
Officials presented analysis suggesting that additional gains from further
integration with the United States remain to be realized. Further regulatory harmonization
with the United States could produce significant welfare gains, as could the liberalization of
NAFTA’s rules-of-origin provisions.
58.
Officials reiterated their commitment to double the International Assistance
Envelope by the end of the decade. This should raise Official Development Assistance
(ODA), therefore improving Canada’s ODA/GNI ratio, which, at 0.26 percent, was in the
mid-range of OECD ratios in 2003. Nearly half of this additional funding will be targeted to
Africa, further strengthening Canada’s role in the G8 Action Plan for Africa and the U.K.-led
Commission for Africa.
VII. STAFF APPRAISAL
59.
Canada’s recent macroeconomic performance has been enviable, and has reflected
the benefits of sound institutions and a strong policy framework. Inflation targeting has

- 27 -

provided a transparent basis for monetary policy while the strong commitment to “budget
balance or better” has yielded welcome progress toward the debt reduction needed to cope
with the fiscal pressures of an aging population. This institutional structure, as well as
structural reforms, have delivered the fastest growth in the G-7 since 1995. In addition, the
authorities have been receptive to past Fund advice, and have recently added a debt target to
the fiscal framework and more detail on Bank of Canada forecasts in the MPR, as suggested
in last year’s report.
60.
The economy is likely to continue to perform solidly in the coming year, but the
challenge is to guard against the considerable uncertainties that remain. Growth is
expected at around 3 percent into 2005 and following the Canadian dollar’s recent
appreciation, the exchange rate appears broadly consistent with medium-term fundamentals.
However, while there are clearly upsides to the outlook, an even sharper drop in net exports
cannot be ruled out, global current account imbalances could result in further significant
exchange rate appreciation and a more abrupt slowing of consumer spending remains a
possibility.
61.
Looking beyond the near term, important challenges also remain. Exchange rate
appreciation, commodity price volatility, prospective trade liberalization, and the potential
spillovers from the resolution of global current account imbalances emphasize the
importance of flexible labor and product markets. In addition, Canada—like other industrial
countries—faces a sharp increase in the share of the elderly population in coming decades.
Meeting these challenges will require sustained fiscal prudence, fundamental reform to
control health care costs, and structural policies to maximize productivity.
62.
The Bank of Canada appears to have room to maintain a patient and measured
approach to withdrawing stimulus. The Bank has appropriately started to increase interest
rates, and further tightening will likely be needed. At the same time, the absence of wage
pressures, the risks to the outlook, and anchored inflation expectations, imply that a cautious
and pragmatic approach to monetary tightening would be consistent with the inflation target.
63.
The Bank’s moves to strengthen further policy transparency and communication
are commendable. The additional information on macroeconomic projections in the MPR is
a welcome innovation, and the Bank’s active communication strategy has been effective in
preparing markets for recent shifts in policy stance. There remains scope, however, for
providing a richer background on policymakers’ views on the distribution of risks and related
policy implications at the time of the Bank’s fixed action dates, especially when these are not
accompanied by an MPR or an Update.
64.
Recent agreements with the provinces have all but removed room for fiscal
maneuver and increased the premium on fiscal prudence. There is very limited room for
new initiatives in the forthcoming budget and, while planning surpluses are projected to
reemerge from FY 2007–08, the staff caution against placing an undue weight on these
forecasts given the uncertainties around such projections.

- 28 -

65.
The objective of lowering the federal debt-to-GDP ratio to 25 percent within ten
years has added a welcome medium-term anchor to the fiscal framework. Keeping the
debt-to-GDP ratio on a downward path at all levels of government over the next decade and
beyond will be an important element in preparing Canada for the long-term fiscal challenge
posed by population aging, and could provide a useful anchor in case a large shock required a
temporary breach of the commitment to balanced budget or better.
66.
More needs to be done to ensure the sustainability and efficiency of the health care
system. The latest federal-provincial agreement has provided stable funding for provincial
health programs and mechanisms to improve accountability and comparability across
provinces. The major challenge, however, will be to improve the system’s efficiency,
including through measures that improve incentives for both health care providers and
consumers. Permitting a diversity of provincial strategies to control costs and reform public
systems will provide opportunities to test different approaches and identify best practices.
67.
Helpful steps have been taken to enhance further Canada’s already high level of
fiscal transparency. To be sure, recent fiscal surpluses have been greater than projected.
However, this partly reflects the explicitly prudent framework as well as favorable economic
developments. Nonetheless, it is important to ensure that public confidence in the process
remains strong and sustains the social consensus for continued debt reduction.
68.
The demographic shift and the ongoing challenges from increasingly globalized
markets underscore the importance of further structural reforms. Recent policies have laid
a solid foundation for future growth and created a favorable environment for business, but
there is more to be done:
•

The tax burden remains relatively high. Given limited fiscal room, an emphasis is
needed on measures that yield the greatest efficiency gain.

•

The EI system combines unemployment insurance and social assistance. Funding the
latter function through general revenues would be more efficient and transparent, and
every effort should be made to reinforce the insurance principle of the program.

•

Reforms in other social programs could help increase labor utilization and efficiency.
There remains room to reduce incentives for early retirement in the public pension
system and low “welfare walls” in the social transfer system.

•

Reducing regulatory barriers to trade and competition. Regulatory frameworks and
infrastructure investment could be strengthened, particularly in the electricity sector.

•

Maintaining the momentum for multilateral trade liberalization. Canada can play an
important leadership role in efforts to complete the Doha Round, including by further
relaxing trade barriers for “supply-managed” agricultural products.

69.
Further reforms to Canada’s sound financial system could promote flexibility in a
rapidly changing global environment:

- 29 -

•

The regulatory framework governing bank mergers could be further clarified.
Addressing this would reduce uncertainty and could enable efficiency gains.

•

Adopting a single national securities regulator would reduce compliance and
administrative costs. The upcoming review of financial sector regulation may also
provide scope for reducing regulatory overlap.

•

Useful steps have been taken to harmonize the regulation of defined benefit pension
plans. Consideration could also be given to enhancing incentives for funding.

70.
Recent commitments to promoting foreign development and assistance are
commendable. Canada’s support for African development, including the cancellation of
official debt owed to Canada by several African countries, is particularly noteworthy.
71.

It is recommended that the next consultation occur on the usual 12-month cycle.

Exchange Rate Arrangements: The Canadian authorities do not maintain margins
with respect to exchange transactions, and exchange rates are determined on the basis of
demand and supply conditions in the exchange market. However, the authorities may
intervene to maintain orderly conditions in the exchange market. There are no taxes or
subsidies on purchases or sales of foreign exchange. Canada has lifted restrictions imposed in
1992 with respect to the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (Serbia and Montenegro) and has
replaced restrictions imposed with respect to Iraq with a new regulation, which the
authorities intend to notify to the Executive Board under Decision 144-(52/51).

Last Article IV Consultation: The staff report for the 2004 consultation with
Canada was considered by the Executive Board on February 18, 2004 (EBM/04/14). Canada
is on a 12-month consultation cycle.

FSAP Participation and ROSC Assessments

Canada - Financial System Stability Assessment Volume II: Report on Observance of Standards
in the Financial System

FO/Dis/00/2, Sup. 1,
04/01/00

Summary: The FSSA report concluded that Canada has a stable and highly advanced
financial system, which is among the soundest in the world. Moreover, it is supported
by a well-developed regulatory system that shows a high degree of compliance with
major international standards. Nevertheless, the FSSA report made a few
recommendations to further strengthening the regulatory framework and financial
system’s resilience, most of which have already been addressed, including:
•

Introducing capital requirements for the guarantees in life insurance segregated
fund (completed by end-2001);

•

Tabling legislation granting OSFI powers to remove a financial institution’s
director or senior officer if the person is deemed not suitable to hold that office
based on a number of criteria. The latter legislation brought Canada into broad
compliance with the Basel Core Principles;

•

Making significant progress in harmonizing securities regulation and improving
coordination among provincial securities regulators, including through a newly
created association of securities regulators, the Canadian Securities
Administrators. Although there remain multiple regulators at the provincial level,
a Senate commission was created to develop specific recommendations on further
harmonization and streamlining of securities regulation.

Canada: Report on the Observance of Standards
and Codes—Fiscal Transparency Module

IMF Country Report
No. 02/51, 03/12/02

Summary: The report found that fiscal management in Canada meets the
requirements of the fiscal transparency code, and in a number of instances represents
best practice. In particular, it highlighted the use of private sector economic forecasts,
prudence factors, and a contingency reserve for fiscal forecasting in Canada. Fiscal
management was also commended for its statistical integrity, impartial tax
administration, open procurement, and a transparent regulatory process.
The report found several areas where further improvements would be desirable,
including: (i) the preparation of timely, current year estimates of federal and
provincial budgets on a comparable basis, (ii) a comprehensive account of the
procedures for the budget cycle and expenditure management system, (iii) systematic
reporting of the use of reserves for non-economic contingencies, (iv) resume
publication of reconciled national and public accounts forecasts of major aggregates
over the forecast horizon, and (v) publication by all governments of quasi-fiscal
activities.

- 37 -

APPENDIX I

Many of these issues have been addressed, including: (i) the release by Statistics
Canada of consolidated data for federal and provincial budgets for 2001–02 (on a
Financial Management System basis), and (ii) the publication of comprehensive
descriptions of budget and expenditure management procedures, including: a joint
document entitled “Budgeting in Canada” by the Government and the OECD;
detailed accounts of policies and procedures on expenditure management at the
website of the Treasury Board Secretariat; and the explanation of the budget cycle
and process in Budget and Update documents.
Canada: Report on the Observance of Standards
and Codes—Data Module

IMF Country Report
No. 03/328, 10/23/03

Summary: Canada’s macroeconomic statistics are comprehensive, timely, and
accurate and thus adequate to conduct effective surveillance of economic and
financial policies. Official institutions responsible for the compilation and
dissemination of the macroeconomic datasets are supported by adequate legal and
institutional frameworks. These frameworks protect confidentiality and ensure that
statistical work is conducted within a quality assurance program and with sufficient
resources. Integrity is ensured by the professionalism of the staff, transparency in
statistical policies and practices, and the provision of ethical guidelines for staff.
Compilers generally follow internationally accepted guidelines in the production of
the macroeconomic statistics, which is well-supported by excellent efforts to develop
source data that facilitate a high degree of accuracy and reliability. Statistics are
generally relevant, well documented, available with good frequency on a timely basis,
and readily accessible to users, who trust them as objective.
While recognizing the high quality of the macroeconomic data, the report makes
recommendations to further strengthen the statistical system, most of which are
already being addressed, including these priorities:
•

Articulate the roles of Statistics Canada and the Bank of Canada in producing
financial sector statistics and explore possibilities for more data sharing of
monetary and financial statistics;

•

Estimate consumption of fixed capital at replacement cost rather than historic
costs now used for the corporate sector in the Canadian System of National
Accounts (CSNA);

•

Disseminate information on the sources and methods used in compiling quarterly
public sector statistics for the quarterly CSNA; and

•

Reclassify certain transactions that are not recorded in line with the 5th edition of
the Balance of Payments Manual (BPM5).

APPENDIX II

Canada—Statistical Issues
The quality, coverage, periodicity, and timeliness of Canada’s economic data are considered
to be excellent both in the context of the Article IV consultation and for purposes of ongoing
surveillance. Canada has subscribed to the Fund’s Special Data Dissemination Standard
(SDDS), and its metadata are posted on the Fund’s Dissemination Standard Bulletin Board
(DSBB).
Real Sector. Statistical Authorities of Canada (Statistics Canada) provide timely and
adequate data in monthly, quarterly, and annual frequency thereby facilitating the analysis of
economic developments and assessment of policy proposals within a quantitative
macroeconomic framework. In May 2001, Statistics Canada effected a smooth transition
from Laspeyres methodology for estimating real expenditure-based GDP to Fisher index
formulae, which enabled more accurate comparison between Canada and other G-7
countries.
Fiscal Sector. The Department of Finance of Canada (Finance Canada) provides monthly
and annual data on the federal government’s budget, tax policies, rules and regulations for
Canada’s banks and other financial institutions. The provided data enable adequate
assessment of the impact of fiscal policy measures on Canada’s economic performance.
Monetary Sector. The Bank of Canada provides timely and adequate coverage of daily,
weekly, monthly and quarterly data related to the monetary sector.
External Sector. Statistics Canada provides timely information on a quarterly frequency on
the balance of payments, external debt, and the international investment position (IIP).
Finance Canada provides monthly data on Official International Reserves in a format
comparable to the IMF’s reserve data template, thus enabling adequate surveillance. Data are
published at http://www.fin.gc.ca/finsearch/finresults_e.asp?Who=News.

Statement by the IMF Staff Representative
February 16, 2005

1.
This note reports on recent developments since the staff report was issued. These
developments do not alter the thrust of the staff appraisal.
2.
Economic indicators have moderated somewhat in the fourth quarter. Following an
annualized 3¼ percent increase in real GDP in the third quarter of 2004, growth slowed to a
1½ percent rate in October and November. Although the manufacturing sector continued to
expand and capacity utilization reached a 16-year high, job creation has been flat and
business confidence declined in the last quarter of 2004. However, the unemployment rate
remained around 7 percent, and core inflation inched up slightly to 1¾ percent in December
2004.
3.
The staff continue to project 2005 growth at slightly below 3 percent. The staff’s
growth projection—which is close to the January private sector consensus—is supported by
the easing of the exchange rate to below the psychologically important mark of US$0.80 per
Canadian dollar during the past month, the stabilization of net exports in November and
December after the sharp drop in the third quarter, and the pick up in consumer confidence
and other leading indicators in January.
4.
The Bank of Canada again left its target for the overnight interest rate at
2½ percent at its January 25 fixed action date. In the accompanying press release and
Monetary Policy Update, the Bank noted that the economy was expected to grow 2.8 percent
in 2005, somewhat slower than expected earlier, and suggested that the pace of reduction in
monetary stimulus was likely to be slower than envisioned in its October report. With the
output gap projected to close only in the second half of 2006, core inflation is not expected to
return to the 2 percent mid-point of the Bank’s target range before the end of next year.
5.
Financial markets are currently pricing in only one 25 basis point rate increase this
year, in the third quarter. Long-term interest rates have declined by about 80 basis points
since mid-2004, notwithstanding the combined 50 basis points increase in short-term interest
rates in September and October. The inflation premium implicit in 30-year government
inflation-linked bonds has fallen to 2 percent, almost a full percentage point lower than at the
same time last year.
6.
The FY 2005/06 Budget is to be released on February 23. Given the relatively tight
budget constraint, analysts expect no major spending or tax initiatives. Statements by Finance
Minister Goodale suggest that some of last year’s surplus could be used to boost federal
daycare spending, while some news reports also suggest that the budget could include
proposals to reduce corporate taxes.

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2005 Article IV Consultation with Canada
On February 16, 2005, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded
the Article IV consultation with Canada.1
Background
Canada has had a remarkable macroeconomic performance since the mid-1990s, including the
fastest growth rate and strongest budget position among the large industrial countries. Although
the economy was hit, in 2002-03, by exchange rate appreciation, a SARS outbreak, forest fires,
a large power outage, and a case of “mad cow” disease, it rebounded strongly through late
2004. In recent months, aggregate demand has softened somewhat as net exports slowed,
owing partly to the dampening effects of the stronger Canadian dollar.
The economy has been supported by robust domestic spending. Final domestic demand grew
at an annual rate of around 3¾ percent since mid-2003, with buoyant household spending
shored up by employment gains and increases in net wealth. At the same time, business
investment expanded at a robust pace, boosted by strong corporate earnings, low interest rates,
and falling costs for imports of capital goods. Low interest rates continued to benefit residential
investment, contributing to strong increases in construction activity.
By contrast, net exports mostly weighed on economic activity as the Canadian dollar
appreciated in recent years. In 2003, net exports subtracted 2½ percentage points from real
GDP growth on the back of a 13 percent foreign exchange rate appreciation in real effective
terms. Strong foreign demand for Canadian products temporarily boosted export growth in the
1

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies.
On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the
Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the
Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the
country's authorities.

-2first half of 2004, with favorable terms of trade also contributing to a record current account
surplus. Beginning in the third quarter of 2004, however, the contribution of net exports to GDP
growth turned sharply negative.
The Canadian dollar reached a 12-year high against its U.S. counterpart in late 2004, supported
in part by the adjustment of currencies to global current account imbalances. More recently,
short-term interest rate differentials with the United States have narrowed and pressure on the
Canadian dollar has eased.
With a strengthening domestic currency and moderating aggregate demand growth, inflation in
2004 remained subdued. Despite a small increase in mid-2004, partly in response to higher
energy prices, the year-on-year core inflation rate stood at 1¾ percent in December, slightly
below the 2 percent mid-point of the Bank of Canada’s target range. Wage pressures also
remained well contained, possibly reflecting the strong rise in labor supply. The participation
ratio remains close to a record high, apparently reflecting greater labor force attachment
associated with rising education levels across cohorts. Despite a gradual drop in the
unemployment rate, wage demands remained muted and unit labor costs were essentially flat.
As the economy rebounded in late 2003 and early 2004, economic slack narrowed, prompting
the Bank to withdraw monetary stimulus. With the Bank’s measure of output gap closed by the
second quarter of 2004 and industrial capacity utilization approaching its 15-year peak, the
Bank of Canada increased its overnight rate twice by 25 basis points to 2½ percent in
September and October, noting that real interest rates were well below neutral levels.
However, the Bank has since held its target rate steady, citing growing concern about the
impact of the exchange rate on economic activity.
Fiscal policy continued to perform strongly in 2004, contributing to steady debt reduction.
The federal budget reached its seventh consecutive surplus in FY 2003–04 (April to March) at
¾ percent of GDP, more than ½ percent of GDP higher than budgeted. The overachievement
largely reflects tax revenue buoyancy, benefiting from the rebound in activity beginning in late
2003. Nonetheless, going forward, the room for fiscal maneuver is limited because of federal
spending commitments, including significant increases in transfers to provinces over the
medium term.
Provincial government budgets remained close to balance in aggregate. Health care spending
continued to outpace revenue growth, prompting provincial demands for higher federal transfers
and, in some cases, higher taxes. Nonetheless, the strength of federal finances left the general
government with a FY2003-04 surplus estimated at around ½ percent of GDP.
Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors agreed with the thrust of the staff appraisal. They commended Canada’s
enviable macroeconomic performance since the mid-1990s, including the fastest growth rate
and the strongest budget position in the G-7. Canada’s performance reflects sound institutions,
structural reforms, and a strong macroeconomic policy framework. In particular, Directors noted
that inflation targeting has provided a solid and transparent basis for monetary policy, while the
strong commitment to “budget balance or better” has yielded welcome progress toward the debt
reduction needed to cope with the fiscal pressures of an aging population.

-3-

Directors agreed that the economy is likely to continue to perform solidly in the coming year,
supported by robust growth in consumer demand and business investment. They noted,
however, that there are important risks to the outlook. Directors warned, in particular, of the
possibility of a sharper-than-expected drop in net exports, particularly given the Canadian
dollar’s recent appreciation against the US dollar, and a more abrupt softening of consumer
spending. Directors observed that the unwinding of global current account imbalances could
result in further upward pressure on the Canadian dollar. In their view, the uncertainties
surrounding prospects for exchange rates, global commodity prices, and the ongoing process of
trade liberalization, place an additional premium on policies to improve fiscal prudence,
economic flexibility and productivity.
Directors agreed that monetary tightening in the second half of 2004 was appropriate and that
further tightening could eventually be needed. They suggested, however, that there is room for
a cautious and pragmatic approach to withdrawing stimulus, consistent with meeting the
inflation target, particularly considering the absence of wage pressures, the risks to the outlook,
and well-anchored inflation expectations.
Directors considered Canada’s inflation targeting framework successful, noting that it has
brought down inflation and helped to anchor expectations. They commended the Bank of
Canada for further strengthening policy transparency and stepping up its communication
activities. They welcomed the additional information that is now provided on macroeconomic
projections in the Monetary Policy Report (MPR), and observed that the Bank of Canada has
been effective in preparing markets for the recent shift in its policy stance. Some Directors
suggested that more background information on policymakers’ views on the distribution of risks
and related policy implications would be useful to markets, while others believed that the current
communications strategy strikes an appropriate balance between transparency and candor.
Directors commended the authorities’ fiscal framework, which has delivered a broad-based
social consensus for fiscal prudence. The commitment to budget balance or better has resulted
in seven consecutive surpluses and a large reduction in federal debt, while allowing for a
sizable tax reduction. In this regard, Directors welcomed the federal government’s recently
announced objective of lowering the federal debt-to-GDP ratio to 25 percent within ten years.
The addition of such an explicit medium-term anchor to the fiscal framework could be especially
useful for ensuring that the longer-term costs of budget measures are taken fully into account,
and for coping with large shocks that require a temporary breach of the commitment to
balanced budget or better.
Directors observed that recent spending commitments, including increased transfers to
provinces, have limited the room for fiscal maneuver and meant that the forthcoming budget will
need to focus on key priorities. Directors agreed that Equalization payments should not become
an entitlement, and urged the authorities to use the upcoming review to design a system which
provides a transparent and equitable basis for payments across provinces, while avoiding the
year-to-year volatility of the previous system. Directors hoped the ongoing expenditure review
will serve as the basis for a careful evaluation of the merits of spending programs versus further
reducing the relatively high tax burden. In light of the medium-term commitments to provinces
and the importance of transparency regarding the longer-term impact of fiscal measures, many
Directors supported a longer-term budget planning horizon. However, they cautioned against

-4placing an undue weight on the planning surpluses projected to reemerge from fiscal year
2007/08, given the uncertainties that surround the fiscal forecast.
Directors noted that there remain longer-term challenges to fiscal balances from population
aging, in particular with regard to growing health care spending. They considered that, despite
large increases in transfers to provincial health plans, steps are still needed to ensure the
sustainability of the health care system. Directors therefore emphasized the importance of
health care reform including greater focus on improving incentives for cost containment by both
health care providers and consumers. In this regard, a few Directors observed that the
government made a commitment to increase transfers to provinces without explicitly requiring
reforms to improve the efficiency of health care spending.
Directors commended the authorities’ efforts to enhance further Canada’s already high level of
fiscal transparency. They considered that the larger-than-anticipated federal budget surpluses in
recent years reflect the transparent and prudent fiscal framework in addition to favorable
economic developments. Directors emphasized that it remains important to sustain the social
consensus for continued debt reduction while at the same time allowing well-informed debate
on the relative merits of spending programs versus tax cuts. In this context, some Directors
suggested that adopting a five-year fiscal planning horizon would be helpful in demonstrating
the longer-term fiscal impact of policy measures, including recent commitments to the
provinces.
Directors agreed that recent structural policies have laid a solid foundation for future growth.
At the same time, they noted that further structural reforms would assist in dealing with the
demographic shift, the ongoing challenges from increasingly global markets, and lowering the
underlying rate of unemployment. In this context, Directors underscored the importance of
sustaining fiscal prudence, continuing structural reforms to maximize productivity, and
strengthening incentives to save and invest. Directors also called for controlling health care
costs in order to prepare the economy for the effects of population aging. Given the limited fiscal
room, tax reductions would need to be focused on measures that yield the greatest efficiency
gain while preserving the prudent fiscal balance. Reforms to reduce both incentives for early
retirement in the public pension system and disincentives in the social transfer system could
help increase labor utilization. Many Directors noted that reinforcing the insurance principle of
the Employment Insurance program and funding the social assistance component of the
program through general revenues could enhance economic efficiency and transparency, as
could further reductions in regulatory barriers to trade and competition.
Directors commended the strength and soundness of Canada’s well-managed financial system.
Capital ratios are robust, and the system is well-positioned to respond to monetary tightening.
Directors noted that further reforms could enhance the system’s ability to benefit from a rapidly
changing global environment. They agreed that adopting a single national securities regulator
would help reduce compliance and administrative costs, and that clarifying the regulatory
framework governing bank mergers would reduce uncertainty and possibly allow institutions to
reap efficiency gains. A number of Directors wondered whether the dominance of six large
Canadian banks does not reflect a lack of competitiveness in the banking system, while others
pointed out that banking system efficiency was not necessarily tied to the number of large banks
in a country. Directors also encouraged the authorities to consider enhancing incentives for

-5firms to fund their defined benefit pension plans, and to use the upcoming review of financial
sector regulation as an opportunity to reduce regulatory overlap.
Directors commended Canada’s support for multilateral trade liberalization and encouraged the
authorities to continue its important leadership role in efforts to complete the Doha Round,
including by further relaxing trade barriers for “supply-managed” agricultural products.
They welcomed Canada’s recent commitments to promoting foreign development and
assistance—in particular, the intended doubling of its official development assistance envelope
by the end of the decade and the support for African development, including the cancellation of
official debt owed to Canada by several African countries.

Public Information Notices (PINs) are issued, (i) at the request of a member country, following the
conclusion of the Article IV consultation for countries seeking to make known the views of the IMF to the
public. This action is intended to strengthen IMF surveillance over the economic policies of member
countries by increasing the transparency of the IMF's assessment of these policies; and (ii) following
policy discussions in the Executive Board at the decision of the Board. The Staff Report for the 2004
Article IV Consultation with Canada is also available.
