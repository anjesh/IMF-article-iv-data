STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2014 ARTICLE IV CONSULTATION
November 17, 2014

KEY ISSUES
Context. South African citizens’ living standards have improved substantially in the first
twenty years of democracy. But in recent years the economy has underperformed peers.
The outlook is lackluster, with low growth, high unemployment, and elevated twin deficits.
As in many emerging markets, weak external demand and soft commodity prices
contributed to these outcomes, but deep-seated structural factors also played an
important role. After years of accommodation, fiscal and monetary policies are
constrained by rising vulnerabilities. With the elections over, the government has an
opportunity to implement structural reforms, essential to address unemployment, poverty,
and inequality.
Structural reforms. An extensive public infrastructure program will ease binding
electricity and transport bottlenecks over time. Besides improved state-owned enterprise
efficiency, greater private sector participation would help as public balance sheets are
stretched. Normalization of industrial relations, combined with greater competition in
product markets, more inclusive labor markets, and reduced skill mismatches, remain
indispensable to boost job-rich and sustainable growth, lower vulnerabilities, and enhance
the economy’s ability to rebalance toward exports and investment.
Fiscal and monetary policies. With rising vulnerabilities, macroeconomic policies are
rightly factoring in the risks South Africa faces. As planned in the 2014 Medium-Term
Budget Policy Statement, fiscal consolidation is needed to ensure debt stabilization over
the medium term. Under staff’s baseline, further measures may be needed. The recent
large drop in oil prices and the envisaged fiscal adjustment may enable the South African
Reserve Bank to stay accommodative for longer. Higher interest rates may become
necessary if global financial conditions tighten sharply.
Policies to enhance resilience. The Financial Sector Stability Assessment (FSSA)
concludes that financial sector risks are elevated but manageable. It recommends
heightened scrutiny of asset quality and liquidity risks. To complement the authorities’
regulatory reform of the financial sector, the FSSA advises enhanced stress tests, groupwide supervision, a strengthened financial safety net, and a clearer allocation of
responsibilities and coordination among institutions. The flexible exchange rate regime
and a favorable currency composition of external debt are effective buffers against capital
flow volatility, but higher reserves and policies to facilitate foreign direct investment would
further strengthen resilience.

CONTEXT: SUBSTANTIAL PROGRESS IN THE PAST
20 YEARS AND CHALLENGES AHEAD

2.
The country’s aspiration is a society free of poverty with low levels of
unemployment and inequality, which requires addressing deep-seated structural issues. A
25 percent unemployment rate and differences in labor income and wealth have resulted in one
of the most unequal societies in the world. Poverty is high relative to other emerging markets
(EMs). These challenges largely result from structural problems.2 Barriers to entry in product

The South African economy is also facing challenges in the near term. Since 2010,
growth, driven mainly by consumption, has been weak, and the private sector has created too
few jobs, despite supportive macroeconomic policies and ample global liquidity providing easy
financing for the large twin deficits. Going forward, headwinds stem from tighter global financial
conditions, the uneven global recovery, and reduced policy space. Also, commodity prices and
credit, which provided a fillip to growth in the boom years, are no longer as supportive.
4.
With the elections over, the government has an opportunity to make strides in
addressing the country’s challenges. The African National Congress (ANC) won 62 percent of
the vote in the May 2014 elections (66 percent in 2009). President Zuma stated that radical socioeconomic transformation to push back the triple challenges of poverty, inequality, and
unemployment is the priority in his second term.3 The policies, which have the large
infrastructure program at its core, are articulated in the Medium-Term Strategic Framework
(MTSF), which is the implementation roadmap of the National Development Plan (NDP) and the
ANC manifesto. Structural economic reforms are executed through the Industrial and Policy
Action Plan and New Growth Path, which emphasize the role of a developmental state and
industrial policy, and through “budget decisions that contribute to making the NDP a reality”
(Annex I).4
5.
The 2014 Article IV consultation centers on policies to boost growth and job
creation and strengthen resilience. In particular, it focuses on: (i) macro-critical structural
reforms to generate job-rich growth and increase the economy’s flexibility; (ii) fiscal policy in a
constrained environment; (iii) policies to further enhance financial sector resilience, as
recommended by the 2014 Financial System Stability Assessment (FSSA).

1/ The light blue area represents the three center quintiles for other EMs.



While several EMs are facing growth
challenges, since 2010 South Africa’s growth is estimated about ⅔ of a percentage point
lower per annum than expected given trading partners’ growth.



The unemployment rate remained at 25½ percent in 2014:Q3. The private sector has
recovered less than 40 percent of the jobs lost in 2008–10, while most new jobs during this
period have been created in the public sector.

7.

Although difficult to pinpoint, the evidence points to lower potential growth.





As in many EMs, several studies
suggest that South Africa’s
potential growth has declined in the
past few years. This is consistent
with staff estimates which indicate
that potential growth has fallen to
2–2½ percent—implying a negative
output gap of about ½–1¼ percent
in 2014—as what were initially
perceived to be cyclical factors turn
out to be increasingly structural.7

Declining productivity growth is the main driver behind lower potential growth, which might
be related to increasingly-binding structural constraints. At the same time, the contribution
of labor to potential growth has been limited and capital intensity has risen.

Bank lending rates, which matter more for households and private corporates and
are linked to the policy rate, have also risen. Besides the South African Reserve Bank’s (SARB)
75 bps repo increase since January 2014, factors contributing to tighter domestic financial
conditions include: Basel III’s more stringent capital and liquidity requirements; the placement of
African Bank (a small bank specialized in unsecured lending) under curatorship in August 2014,
credit rating downgrades, and tighter lending standards as asset quality of unsecured lending is
deteriorating.8 The impact is falling mainly on households, especially in lower income segments,
which are highly indebted and have benefitted less from housing and stock price rises.9 Private
firms are less affected, as retained earnings typically fund a large share of their investment.
10.


External rebalancing has started, though limited considering the large depreciation.
The current account deficit reached 5.8 percent of GDP (5.6 percent cyclically adjusted) in
2013 and 5.4 percent of GDP in 2014:H1, reflecting strikes, persistent competitiveness
problems, soft terms of trade, and weaker trading partners’ demand (Figure 5).

8

Moody’s August 2014 downgrade of the four largest banks was mainly triggered by the appropriate decision to
bail in senior unsecured bond holders and wholesale depositors of African Bank, lowering the likelihood of
government support for other financial institutions rather than a reassessment of these banks’ stand-alone credit
rating. Other rating agencies did not downgrade South African banks at that juncture. S&P’s June 2014
downgrade and Moody’s November 2014 downgrade of the largest banks followed the sovereign downgrade.

Although trade volumes have begun to
adjust, South Africa’s exports have remained
subdued despite a substantial and prolonged
depreciation. A staff study suggests that the
exports of firms in sectors with higher
electricity intensity, greater product market
concentration, and more marked labor market
rigidities have responded less to the
depreciation.10

currency composition of external debt, and capital controls on residents (Figure 6).11

Fiscal. Despite fiscal efforts, rising government debt (46 percent of GDP in FY2013/14 from

2014 and to Moody’s downgrade to Baa2 in November 2014, both with a stable outlook.12
Significant SOE borrowing—especially by the electricity monopoly Eskom—means public
sector debt is growing even faster. A large domestic institutional investor base mitigates
refinancing risk for the government.

Box 1. External Sector Assessment
The IMF external balance assessment (EBA) estimates South Africa’s current account (CA) norm at
-2.4 percent of GDP and a CA gap of -3.2 percent of GDP for 2014. The external sustainability (ES) approach
yields a CA gap of -2.6 percent of GDP. Due to wide confidence intervals and uncertainty related to the
effect of depreciation in the pipeline, staff assess the CA balance to be 1½ to 3½ percent of GDP weaker
than implied by medium-term fundamentals and desirable policy settings.

The EBA CPI-based REER regression estimates an
undervaluation for 2014, but other competitiveness indicators,
including the EBA CA and ES gap estimates, and South Africa’s
declining share of world’s exports, continue pointing to
overvaluation. Also, the unit labor cost (ULC)-based REER, which
better captures competitiveness, remains closer to its 10-year
average than the CPI-based REER. Based on the EBA CA gap and
ES estimates, staff assess the REER as overvalued by 5-20
percent, although structural factors are hindering the CA
adjustment to the depreciation.

Sources: SARB, Haver, IMF GEE, and staff calculations

Non-FDI flows, particularly portfolio and other investment liabilities, have accounted for most of the
financing of the CA deficit in recent years. A sharp slowdown of capital inflows would complicate the
financing of the CA deficit, but these risks are attenuated by the floating exchange rate, the large share of
long-term local currency bonds, and large assets under management of domestic institutional investors,
subject to capital controls.
South Africa’s exchange rate regime is one of the most flexible among EMs, and FX intervention is rare.
Reserves cover 5 months of imports and close to 80 percent of gross external financing needs, but remain
slightly below the lower bound of the IMF’s reserve adequacy metric.
Gross external debt has increased to 41.8 percent of GDP in 2014:Q2 from about 25 percent of GDP in 2009,
but short-term external debt (12.7 percent of GDP) remains manageable. The net IIP position
(-6.1 percent of GDP in 2014:Q2) has improved with depreciation, due to 55 percent of external debt being
in rand while most external assets are in foreign currency.

Financial. The FSSA concluded that
financial sector risks and vulnerabilities
are elevated but manageable given a
challenging operating environment
(Annex III). Capital buffers are relatively
high, and regulation and supervision are
strong (Figure 7). The main risks are
credit risk, which is rising, reliance on
wholesale funding, high
interconnectedness, and a large OTC
derivatives market. The placement of

August has had limited spillovers.

A LACKLUSTER OUTLOOK WITH ELEVATED RISKS
12.
Real GDP growth is projected to slow to 1.4 percent in 2014 and recover only
modestly thereafter. The rebound to 2.1 percent in 2015 is predicated on improved labor
relations allowing inventory rebuilding to offset the drag from financial and fiscal tightening.13 A
muted recovery is expected over the medium term, as slowly easing infrastructure constraints
and the global recovery provide some support for private investment and exports. However,
Eskom recently announced that electricity shortages will continue even after the two new power
plants start operations owing to overdue maintenance on the old system. Hence, growth is
projected to average 2¾ percent in 2016–19, with unemployment remaining close to 25 percent.
The current account deficit is projected to fall modestly to 4½ percent of GDP by 2019 as major
import-intensive infrastructure projects are completed. Inflation is projected to fall further in
2015 on account of easing oil and food prices, and tighter monetary and fiscal stances.
13.
Risks are tilted to the downside. Further delays in relieving electricity constraints, more
strikes, and lower-than-projected growth are deemed the key domestic risks, with adverse
implications for the twin deficits (Box 2). External risks also weigh heavily, especially a sharp surge

could be particularly marked (Box 3).14 Lower global growth and commodity prices could weaken
South Africa’s exports and growth, pressure the fiscal accounts, and result in retrenchments,
though lower oil prices could be a partial offset. Also, the weak economy could undermine
financial institutions’ asset quality. High interconnectedness, concentration, and the size of the
financial system could amplify these risks. Combinations of these risks could lead to capital

1/ The Risk Assessment Matrix (RAM) shows events that could materially alter the baseline path (the scenario most likely to
materialize in the view of IMF staff). The relative likelihood of risks listed is the staff’s subjective assessment of the risks surrounding
the baseline (“low” is meant to indicate a probability below 10 percent, “medium” a probability between 10 and 30 percent, and
“high” a probability between 30 and 50 percent). The RAM reflects staff views on the source of risks and overall level of concern as
of the time of discussions with the authorities. Nonmutually exclusive risks may interact and materialize jointly.

South Africa benefits from a high share of institutional investors, who typically provide more stable funding
than retail investors but also tend to reduce exposure significantly with downgrades to sub-investment grade and
take longer to return. For further details see IMF (2014), “April 2014 Global Financial Stability Report”.

Box 3. Channels of Inward Spillovers
South Africa’s liquid and open financial markets are a source of strength, but also expose it to volatile
capital flows. Gross external assets and liabilities each exceed 100 percent of GDP, though the net international
investment position is small. Nonresidents’ holding of South Africa’s securities have increased markedly in recent
years, reaching US$200 billion at end-2013 (57 percent of GDP). A high share of equities in non-resident holdings
(about 70 percent) and the long duration of South Africa’s bonds entail that potential capital outflows would be
markedly less. As U.S. investors account for half of all portfolio investment, South Africa’s equity and bond
markets are mainly linked to financial conditions in the U.S. In contrast, BIS foreign claims statistics suggest bank
flows depend more on European banks, especially U.K. banks.

The impact of key advanced economies’ monetary policy
normalization on South Africa will likely depend on the
nature of the exit from unconventional monetary policies.
The 2014 IMF Spillover report finds that a Fed exit driven by a
stronger-than-expected recovery would generally benefit
emerging markets including South Africa, though South Africa’s
moderate trade linkages with the U.S. limits these benefits. But
a bumpy exit due to unexpected monetary tightening would
hurt EM growth, especially vulnerable ones: the impact on
South Africa is in between the one on vulnerable EMs and the
rest of the group.

Inward spillovers could also occur through trade and commodity channels. China is the largest individual
market for South Africa’s exports. A one percentage point slowdown in China’s growth is estimated to lower
South Africa’s growth by 0.6 percentage points cumulatively over two years.1 This includes the impact through the
prices of commodities, which account for over half of South Africa’s goods exports. However, a lower oil price
(accounting for 20 percent of goods imports) could be a partial offset. Sub-Saharan Africa now accounts for
26 percent of South Africa’s exports, while the euro area’s importance has declined in recent years.

Rising trade and financial linkages may be increasing spillovers to, and spillbacks
from, the rest of Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA), though these have been muted thus far.16 SSA
has become the most important destination for nonmineral exports and a major investment
destination for South African corporates and banks, possibly resulting in increased regional
spillovers going forward.17 This offers promising opportunities for South Africa, but could also
amplify the commodity price impact and expose the country to potential negative spillbacks
from mispricing of risks and less developed regulatory structures.
Authorities’ views
15.
The authorities broadly agree on the near-term outlook and are more sanguine
than staff about South Africa’s medium-term growth prospects. While the differences for
2014 are small, they view staff’s medium-term growth forecast as too cautious, pointing to
continued strong public investment in infrastructure and easing supply constraints that should
spur private investment and growth. The authorities also expect a stronger rebound in private
consumption expenditure, anticipating higher employment growth, continued positive wealth
effects, and reduced household debt levels. They emphasize that the MTSF will bolster
confidence and reduce policy uncertainty.
16.
The authorities concur with the key risks and vulnerabilities, but highlight South
Africa’s resilience. While acknowledging that domestic factors have played a key role in the
recent growth slowdown, the authorities underscore that key trading partners’ protracted
slowdown and soft commodity prices have been a major drag. They consider further delays in
easing electricity constraints as the main domestic risk. While acknowledging that structural
factors have lowered potential growth, officials argue that some policies can reverse this trend
quickly, such as opening up borders for skilled workers. They are concerned about the slow
adjustment in the current account deficit, given that U.S. monetary policy normalization will likely
make external financing more challenging. However, the flexible exchange rate, the relatively low
and mainly rand-denominated external debt and the large domestic institutional investor base
provide resilience.

POLICIES TO BOOST JOB-RICH GROWTH AND
RESILIENCE
Minister Nene: “…the biggest constraints to a faster rate of growth are domestic factors, in
other words things that are within our powers to fix”18
17.
The authorities’ macroeconomic policies and Fund views in previous Article IV
consultations have been broadly aligned, but progress on structural reforms remains
mixed. The authorities have adhered to stringent expenditure ceilings and committed
themselves to debt stabilization, but have not adopted a debt anchor. The SARB has
appropriately balanced elevated inflation and weak growth, but, with the rand under pressure,
has not increased reserves. Structural reform progress includes ongoing public infrastructure
projects, the Employment Tax Incentive, a renewed focus on SMEs, and the proposed social and
economic impact assessments of legislative initiatives (Text Table 1). Also, South Africa recently
concluded an Economic Partnership Agreement with the European Union, is negotiating the
renewal of the Africa Growth and Opportunity Act, and pursuing greater integration with SSA.
But some recent legislative initiatives (see paragraph 44) could adversely affect jobs and the
business environment and could contribute to policy uncertainty.
18.
Structural reforms are macro-critical and indispensable, as macroeconomic policies
are constrained by increasingly-binding structural impediments, vulnerabilities, and
prevailing downside risks. The 2014 Medium-Term Budget Policy Statement (MTBPS) marks a
shift in fiscal policy to address vulnerabilities, encouraging a rebalancing of the economy from
consumption to investment and exports, and ensuring sustainable long-term growth and
support for critical social programs. The SARB highlights inflation risks from further depreciation,
a higher exchange rate pass-through as margins have fallen, and a wage-price spiral. Structural
rigidities hindering the current account adjustment to the depreciation force macroeconomic
policies to play a greater role in reducing the current account deficit by lowering domestic
absorption, as external financial conditions become less benign. Hence, addressing structural
constraints is essential to generate more growth and jobs, as well as to improve the external
position, facilitate the economy’s rebalancing, and allow macroeconomic policies to be more
counter-cyclical. A substantial increase in employment is the key component to achieve greater
inclusiveness.
Authorities’ views
19.
The authorities agree that the space for further countercyclical policies is limited
and structural reforms are necessary to raise growth and lower vulnerabilities. The 2014

MTBPS notes that “debt levels have approached the limits of sustainability”. Similarly, the SARB
highlights the challenge of subdued growth and relatively high inflation and the limited
effectiveness of monetary policy in addressing the root causes of South Africa’s weak growth.
The authorities also acknowledge that structural constraints are preventing the country from
benefiting fully from the global recovery and the currency depreciation.

A. Monetary Policy
20.
Inflation is likely to have peaked.
Since 2011, headline and core inflation have
been driven mainly by the large
depreciation, even though the negative and
rising output gap has moderated exchange
rate pass-through (Figure 8). In 2014, food
inflation has also contributed to the inflation
increase. Inflation momentum is declining,
which is likely to continue as evidenced in
falling PPI inflation. Inflation expectations
remain broadly stable.

Monetary policy is finely balanced.



A simple Taylor rule using a 0.4 percent real neutral rate (the 2010–13 average), a 6 percent
inflation target, the top of the SARB’s band, and staff’s inflation forecast argues against a rate
increase. However, over the medium term the SARB is appropriately aiming for inflation
below 6 percent and the neutral rate is highly uncertain but likely higher than in recent years,
all pointing to the need for higher policy rates.19 On balance, therefore, with the recent large
drop in oil prices and the announced fiscal consolidation, the SARB may be able to afford to
stay accommodative for longer, though an increase in rates will ultimately be needed.



In case of materialization of risks to inflation or inflation expectations, or significantly tighter
external funding conditions, policy rate hikes may become necessary sooner to bolster the
SARB’s credibility and facilitate external funding.



To help guide expectations, the SARB could consider enhancing its communications by
publishing inflation projections conditional on explicit interest rate and exchange rate
assumptions, as some other inflation targeting central banks do.

19

Estimates of Taylor rules for South Africa reveal a very small weight on the exchange rate, suggesting only
including inflation and the output gap is appropriate in normal times.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND 15

SOUTH AFRICA

Authorities’ views
22.
The Reserve Bank has announced it is on a gradual and data-dependent
normalization process. SARB officials emphasize that the monetary stance remains
accommodative. However, over the medium term, real interest rates will have to turn positive to
avoid exacerbation of imbalances and possible asset bubbles, and to encourage savings. Inflation
expectations remain anchored at the upper end of the target band and subject to the risk that
continued depreciation could move them to a higher plateau. Staff expect that the SARB’s
Monetary Policy Committee will assess in its next meeting on November 20, inter alia, how the
recent large drop in oil prices and the government’s fiscal consolidation strategy expressed in the
2014 MTBPS may affect the stance of monetary policy going forward. Moreover, the SARB
remains committed to transparent communication and outreach, but believes that releasing
interest rate and exchange rate assumptions could lead to reduced operational flexibility, as
markets could interpret these assumptions as targets.

B. Fiscal Policy
23.
Acknowledging that “fiscal consolidation can no longer be postponed”, the
authorities have announced a front-loaded package of measures to narrow the deficit and
stabilize debt.20 Despite weaker growth, the 2014 MTPBS maintains the 2014 Budget targets,
reducing the deficit from 3.9 percent of GDP in FY2013/14 to 2.5 percent of GDP by FY2017/18,
which in the authorities’ framework results in debt stabilizing just below 50 percent of GDP.
Expenditure ceilings over the next two years have been reduced by a cumulative 0.6 percent of
GDP by freezing spending on nonessential goods and services, restraining the government wage
bill, and reducing transfers to public entities, while aligning spending with the MTSF, protecting
core social services, and enhancing efficiency. Revenue measures yielding a cumulative
0.6 percent of GDP over two years are to be announced in the 2015 Budget.
24.
The fiscal consolidation announced in the 2014 MTBPS is significant, but may not
be sufficient to stabilize debt over the medium term. Automatic stabilizers are expected to
result in a deterioration of the primary balance to -1.1 percent of GDP in FY2014/15 from -0.8
percent in FY2013/14 (the cyclically-adjusted primary balance is estimated to remain unchanged).
In FY2015/16, the fiscal adjustment is expected to result in a 0.5 percent of GDP improvement in
the primary balance, which is projected to reach 0.2 percent of GDP by FY2017/18 (Figure 9).
Also, rising borrowing costs are expected to keep the consolidated deficit close to 3 percent of
GDP. Under staff’s baseline scenario, debt is projected to rise to 56 percent of GDP by FY2019/20.

Multiple risks affect the fiscal outlook.



Wage demands in public sector wage negotiations have started at 15 percent, though the
MTBPS has signaled that “any departure from the path of CPI-linked cost-of-living
adjustments will require either a reallocation of resources from other spending areas…or
prompt a need to reduce government employment” and initial demands are typically
significantly higher than final settlements. The weak state of several SOEs’ balance sheets
could require further support from the sovereign, but the government has announced that
future support will be deficit-neutral and contingent on sound restructuring plans with
strong oversight. In addition, the planned national health insurance could add to spending
pressures and the mooted nuclear power plants could entail a large public debt increase.
Growth could continue to disappoint. Higher-than-projected interest rates and weaker terms
of trade would also weigh on the fiscal accounts.



In the Debt Sustainability Analysis (DSA), shocks to medium-term growth and contingent
liabilities would raise debt to 66–72 percent of GDP by 2019, compared to the 70 percent of
GDP threshold in the DSA and the 60 percent ceiling the 2013 Article IV considered
appropriate for South Africa. Under the same shock scenarios, the financing need would
exceed 15 percent of GDP, the DSA high-risk threshold.

26.
Stabilizing debt below 50 percent of GDP as the 2014 MTBPS plans is appropriate,
and consideration could be given to reducing debt to safer levels in the longer run.


For example, staff simulations indicate that meeting the 2014 MTBPS debt projection (50
percent of GDP) by 2020 would require about 1½ percent of GDP in additional measures.21
The resulting impact on growth would depend on the degree of frontloading and could be
offset by an accommodative monetary policy stance, high credibility, and by implementing

21

Saxegaard, M. and J. Torres (2014), “A Discussion of Fiscal Consolidation Options in South Africa”, South Africa
2014 Article IV Selected Issues.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND 17

SOUTH AFRICA

pro-growth structural reforms. Protecting the poorest from the consolidation would cost only
a modest amount and could be done within existing well-targeted social grants.


Over the longer term, to ensure that debt remains below 60 percent of GDP, it would be
advisable to maintain a tight fiscal stance to reduce debt to 40 percent of GDP and allow
space for macro-fiscal shocks that could have a significant impact on South Africa.22
Adopting a formal debt anchor could enhance the transparency of the fiscal framework and
strengthen the perceived commitment to fiscal sustainability by enforcing corrections for
past slippages.

27.
The composition of the adjustment is a political choice, but cross-country analysis
suggests the wage bill is relatively high and consumption taxes are relatively low.


The increase in tax collection since 1994 is testament to the efforts of the South African
Revenue Service, which have contributed to a robust tax system that compares favorably
internationally. Tax revenue in percent of GDP is now close to the EM median. Revenue from
consumption taxes, however, are relatively low, even though a World Bank study suggests
South Africa’s consumptions taxes are broadly neutral due to zero-rating of basic food
items.23 The Davis Tax Committee tasked with assessing the tax policy framework might
identify other revenue sources.



Primary expenditure as a share of GDP is close to the EM median, and the above-mentioned
World Bank study finds that the progressivity of in-kind social spending is high compared to
other countries. But, the government wage bill is one of the highest among peers. This is
offset by the welcome absence of wasteful subsidies, a problem in many peer countries.

28.
As the 2014 MTBPS underscores, spending composition and quality is critical to
ensure the fiscal strategy supports the objectives of growth, employment, and equity.
South Africa’s challenges stem partly from poor service delivery. For example, although South
Africa’s spending on education is high compared to other EMs, educational outcomes are poor
(see Figure 2). The 2014 MTBPS recognizes that “our expenditure on public services achieves less
than it should”. To improve spending efficiency, the Chief Procurement Office is working toward
centralizing procurement and the 2014 MTBPS states that “we will continue to fight waste and
corruption, supported by our audit institution and stringent monitoring and reporting
requirements”. In addition, undertaking spending reviews, evaluating the impact of tax incentives
in achieving growth and employment goals, and addressing the Auditor General’s
recommendations could help improve the impact of government programs, and minimize the
adverse growth impact of the consolidation while bolstering public support for it.
Authorities’ views
29.
The authorities maintain that this year’s budget deficit slippage is likely to be small,
but acknowledge fiscal risks. Despite weaker-than-expected growth, the contingency reserve,
underspending in some areas, and the depreciation will likely offset part of the revenue
underperformance in the first half of the year. The authorities acknowledge that fiscal risks are
significant, but argue that “the fiscal package will mitigate some of these risks, including helping
to reduce the current account deficit” while acknowledging that a “deterioration in the economic
outlook…would require consideration of additional measures”.24 Though fiscal policy continues to
be guided by the principles of counter-cyclicality, debt sustainability, and intergenerational
fairness, the focus will rotate from counter-cyclicality to sustainability.
30.
The authorities remain firmly committed to fiscal sustainability and to taking the
measures necessary to achieve this objective. The medium-term consolidation path outlined
in the 2014 Budget remains an appropriate roadmap. Growth and inequality concerns will
determine the pace and composition of the adjustment. Improving service delivery and spending
efficiency will reduce the burden of adjustment and render it more socially acceptable. Further,
stronger growth in the medium term will buoy tax revenue, allowing fiscal space to be rebuilt at
the same time as spending can be expanded to achieve the goals of eliminating poverty and
lowering inequality. Finally, while the government will support strategic SOEs, it will explore ways
to divest nonstrategic assets and will encourage high standards of efficiency in public investment
projects.
31.
Treasury officials deem that expenditure ceilings and a deficit reduction path
remain appropriate anchors of their fiscal framework. The government aims to stabilize
public debt and begin to rebuild fiscal space. This will be achieved by remaining within the
primary expenditure limits set in the medium-term framework and reducing the primary deficit.
24

2014 MTBPS.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND 19

SOUTH AFRICA

The authorities do not consider that adopting a debt-to-GDP ceiling or benchmark would be an
appropriate fiscal anchor, given the multitude of factors affecting debt, including the debt
management strategy, and believe that it might undermine the credibility of their wellunderstood fiscal framework.
32.
The authorities point out that several factors underpin South Africa’s sustainable
debt position. They emphasize that net debt at about 40 percent of GDP remains low. The
maturity of the government debt portfolio is well structured, and debt denominated in foreign
currency is only about 10 per cent of the total, which limits the consequences of rand
depreciation. A smooth maturity profile, with the average term-to-maturity above 13 years, and a
large domestic institutional investor base suggest that the impact of short-term swings in global
capital markets could be well absorbed.

C. Policies to Strengthen Resilience
33.
As the FSSA notes, the challenging operating environment for the financial sector
puts a premium on tighter scrutiny of asset quality and ensuring adequate liquidity. The
events surrounding African Bank provided a reminder that asset quality can deteriorate quickly in
a weak economy and that even a small institution can entail systemic risk in a highlyinterconnected system. The authorities’ decisive action, led by the SARB, in the case of African
Bank limited contagion and the proposed bail-in of senior unsecured creditors is a welcome step
in reducing the too-big-to-fail premium for the large banks.
34.
The ongoing twin peaks reform provides an opportunity to address priority areas
to enhance financial sector resilience, including strengthening macro- and microprudential supervision and a more robust financial safety net.


Macro-prudential supervision. The SARB should have the resources and authority to collect
granular data and perform regular stress testing, especially of systemically important financial
institutions. The tests should be conducted on a system-wide basis, including cross border
operations, and be used to validate banks’ own stress test results (Text Table 2).



Micro-prudential supervision. The design and implementation of the proposed twin peaks
reform should address overlaps, gaps, and inconsistencies in supervision, with clear
demarcation of supervisory responsibilities and accountability. In particular, group-wide
supervision and greater coordination between supervisory authorities are essential given
high interconnectedness and a large financial system (300 percent of GDP).25 Enhancing
regulation of collective investment schemes, including introducing variable net asset values

25

Under the planned twin peaks reform, the SARB will be responsible for the prudential supervision of banks,
insurers, financial conglomerates and financial market infrastructures through a Prudential Authority. The
Financial Services Board will become the Market Conduct Authority and will be responsible for consumer
protection through its market-conduct supervision.

20

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

SOUTH AFRICA

for money market funds, should strengthen market discipline and lead to higher banks’ retail
deposits and less reliance on short-term wholesale funding.


Financial safety net. Early intervention powers of the SARB and other prudential regulators
should be enhanced. The intervention of African Bank demonstrates the need to introduce a
resolution regime for banks and systemic nonbank financial institutions that is in line with the
Financial Stability Board’s Key Attributes of Effective Resolution. A deposit insurance scheme
founded on depositor preference would also be an important plank in the crisis management
framework, which can potentially encourage a shift from wholesale to retail funding.

The flexible exchange rate has helped manage volatile capital flows, but higher
reserves could also help prepare against surges in market volatility. South Africa’s reserves
remain below the IMF’s reserve adequacy metric and most EMs’, many of which have recently
increased reserves taking advantage of renewed capital inflows. The BRICS’ Contingency Reserve
Arrangement would enable South Africa to draw

transactions, the SARB could be more
opportunistic in purchasing foreign exchange. Although FX purchases beyond needed base
money creation would have to be sterilized, the carry costs can be viewed as insurance costs that
lower the probability and impact of a negative external financing shock and the country’s
external funding costs.
36.
Improving the business environment and allowing greater private participation in
infrastructure projects could attract more FDI. Despite no capital controls on non-residents
and recent changes to facilitate leveraging the country’s position as gateway to Africa, South
Africa’s inward FDI remains low relative to other EMs. At the same time, greater outward FDI,
which over time will generate higher dividends, has contributed to higher reliance on portfolio
inflows to finance the current account deficit. Hence, attracting more FDI is likely to require
improving the business environment and greater consistency of policies and legislative initiatives
given South Africa’s recent sliding in some investor perception surveys, such as the World

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND 21

SOUTH AFRICA

Economic Forum.26 Further, allowing greater private sector participation in the large
infrastructure projects holds the promise of raising more stable funding sources. The authorities
could also explore more official financing. Finally, building on last year’s improvements of trade

Authorities’ views
37.
The authorities concur with the FSSA assessment on financial stability. They agree
that a weak economy and external vulnerabilities will continue to weigh on the financial sector,
but underscore that the financial sector is sound. The intervention in relation to African Bank,
which had a unique business model, is not symptomatic of wider problems in the system. The
banking system remains robust, based on good levels of capitalization, liquidity, and profitability.
The authorities also emphasize mitigating factors with regard to banks’ dependence on shortterm wholesale funding, noting that wholesale deposits have historically been stable aided by
prudential limits on domestic investors’ foreign exposure. To further improve systemic
surveillance, the authorities will conduct top-down macroprudential stress tests to complement
the existing bottom-up exercises conducted by banks and insurance firms and devote more
resources to validate bottom-up stress test results.
38.
The authorities broadly concur with the FSSA recommendations to strengthen
financial resilience. They find the BCP, IAIS and IOSCO assessments comprehensive and
balanced, and consider them useful tools for enhancing the regulatory and supervisory
framework. The authorities have already taken a number of recommendations into consideration
in drafting legislation for the proposed twin peaks regulatory structure. In particular, they
welcome the recommendation to break down silos and strengthen regulatory coordination,

proposing to include the National Credit Regulator in the membership of the new Financial
Stability Oversight Committee. They also recognize the need to enhance group-wide supervision
in view of the high interconnectedness, and for stronger regulation of collective investment
schemes, including money market funds. The authorities have some questions on how best to
implement deposit insurance, but view the recommendation in line with the Financial Stability
Board’s Key Attributes.
39.
The authorities reiterate the importance of exchange rate flexibility. A large
depreciation compared to other EMs has demonstrated their commitment to a free floating
currency regime, which continues to be the key adjustment mechanism to external shocks.
Exposure to exchange rate risk in banks’, corporations’, and households’ balance sheets is
limited, and SOEs are required to hedge fully their exchange and interest rate risks. The
authorities concur with the assessment that South Africa’s external position remains weak, as the
current account deficit is above normal levels, especially considering the weak growth.
Nevertheless, they note that part of the current account deficit reflects income payments related
to non-resident purchases of rand assets, which are not caused by any particular policy setting or
action.
40.
The authorities agree with the desirability of higher reserves and are mulling
options to achieve this goal. The trend in portfolio flows this year has not provided
opportunities to accumulate reserves, but the SARB remains open to opportunistic purchases.
The Treasury, which has borne most of the cost of higher reserves in the recent past, is unable to
commit resources at this stage given the fiscal situation. Also, the SARB remains concerned about
sterilization costs increasing its losses and about investors’ possibly interpreting FX intervention
in the manner suggested by staff as a change in exchange rate policy that could undermine
capital inflows at a delicate juncture.

D. Structural Reforms to Generate Job-Rich Growth
41.
Easing infrastructure bottlenecks, reducing skill mismatches, reforming product
and labor markets, and liberalizing trade are priorities.27 As envisaged in the NDP, efforts to
27

“Achieving Higher Growth and Employment: Policy Options for South Africa” by Faulkner, D. et al. (2013)
estimates that reducing infrastructure gaps, easing the skill constraint, and increasing investment could raise
potential growth to nearly 8 per cent and decrease unemployment to around 12 percent by 2025. Similarly,
“Trade Policy in South Africa” by Edwards, S. et al. (2009) suggests that trade liberalization in South Africa has a
considerable impact on productivity and trade performance. “An Analysis of Industry Concentration in South
Africa Manufacturing, 1972-2001” by Fedderke, J. and D. Naumann (2005) finds that increased concentration in
manufacturing in South Africa is detrimental to output growth and investment, while “Competition and
Productivity Growth in South Africa” by Aghion, P. et al. (2007) finds a strong negative effect of the price-cost
margin (an inverse measure of product market competition) on productivity growth. Finally, “High
Unemployment Yet Few Small Firms: The Role of Centralized Bargaining in South Africa” by Magruder, J. R. (2012)
finds that sectoral wage agreements decrease employment in affected industries by 8–13 percent, with losses
concentrated among small firms. This is qualitatively consistent with findings of “Unemployment and the
Automatic Extension of Collective Wage Agreements” by de Serres, A. and F. Murtin (2013) on the impact of
administrative extension in OECD economies.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND 23

SOUTH AFRICA

close infrastructure gaps, improve education and training, and strengthen public service delivery
and accountability are essential to lift obstacles to private sector job creation and investment,
diversify the economy, and raise productivity and competitiveness. Several studies suggest that
the payoff of these measures could be substantial. In addition, other studies indicate that
increasing product market competition would boost productivity growth and output, and that
reforming the current system of sectoral bargaining agreements would have a positive impact on
employment, particularly for smaller firms. Consensus is even stronger that a high degree of trust
between firms and workers leads to lower unemployment, which points to the urgency of
improving industrial relations in South Africa.28 President Zuma noted, “Given the impact of the
untenable labor relations environment on the economy, it is critical for social partners to meet
and deliberate on the violent nature and duration of the strikes.”29 Finally, trade liberalization also
appears to have a considerable impact on productivity and exports. Mexico provides a current
example of a country that has embarked on a comprehensive and ambitious structural reform
program in areas where action is needed in South Africa. Moreover, while structural reforms take
time, recent experience of countries including India, Mexico, and the Philippines suggest that
already the credible announcement of a reform package coupled with some quick wins can have
a significant positive impact.30

43.
The authorities’ package for Eskom is a multipronged strategy aimed at ensuring
energy security. It includes a 0.6 percent of GDP equity injection from leveraging nonstrategic
government assets, higher debt, and greater efficiency in Eskom’s operations to limit cost
overruns, optimize maintenance, and improve procurement. In the short run, a peak-load pricing
approach to demand management, while continuing to protect the poorest households, could
contribute to minimizing the impact of electricity shortages on growth. Over the medium run, as
the government has stated, “tariff adjustments remain the key mechanism that will provide the
electricity supply industry with a sustainable solution” complemented by efficiency-enhancing
measures.31 Higher electricity tariffs need not increase overall inflation if accompanied by product
market reforms that can lower other costs. A forthcoming IMF study of the Fiscal Affairs
Department on public investment suggests that South Africa has room to improve its ability to
deliver on investment projects. With state owned enterprises’ balance sheets stretched and
constrained fiscal space, allowing greater private participation in infrastructure with appropriate
safeguards is a necessity.

created since 2008, could cost jobs. Similarly, the proposal to introduce a national minimum
wage to lessen income inequality should be carefully studied, as the average sectoral minimum
wage in South Africa is 62 percent of the average formal wage, compared to the 37 percent
OECD average, and without lower sub-minima for younger workers as in many OECD countries.32
Hence, depending on its level and formulation, a national minimum wage may increase
unemployment, especially for lower-skilled workers. In addition, new visa restrictions for certain

skilled workers could hamper business expansion and job creation.33 Finally, the co-existence of
different development plans and policy initiatives perceived to be going in different directions
contribute to investors’ concerns regarding policy uncertainty.
45.
Product and labor market reforms remain critical to achieve the ultimate objective
of more jobs and a more inclusive economy. Increased product market competition will help
reduce the wage-productivity gap by lowering the cost of living and enhancing productivity.
Simultaneous labor market reforms—increasing the influence of outsiders in wage setting,
exempting SMEs from the extension of collective bargaining outcomes, and reducing firing costs,
as recommended by the OECD—will limit job losses from lower profit margins and facilitate new
firms’ entry. These reforms could be pursued as part of a social bargain including wage restraint
in return for industry’s hiring commitments, and government’s providing better quality education
and training, and targeted transport subsidies.34 The role of the government is critical in ensuring
that the interests of outsiders, the unemployed and small firms, are represented in the bargain.
All these efforts should provide job opportunities, jumpstarting a virtuous cycle of growth, more
jobs, and lower inequality.

Fostering more competition among financial
institutions would result in a greater supply

the FSSA recommends reducing the entry capital requirements to encourage the establishment
of smaller banks, adopting a rules-based exit framework, closing regulatory and supervisory gaps
that favor incumbents, and improving access to financial information and literacy that can help
users compare prices and terms. While a careful balance is needed between financial stability and

the objective of a less concentrated financial system, there is room to accommodate more
competition in the current environment of strong prudential regulation and supervision.
47.
The government focus on promoting SMEs and greater trade, especially with
Africa, is welcome, though additional reforms are needed. SMEs have high potential for job
creation and benefit from SSA growth. To complement the authorities’ initiatives to promote
SMEs, the product and labor market reforms described above are vital, combined with lower
regulatory compliance costs and a financial structure that can provide adequate financing (see
above). The National Employers Association of South Africa’s, representing about 3000 SMEs in
the metal sector, refusal to accept the outcome of sector wage bargaining last July citing it being
unaffordable to its members is a reminder that existing labor arrangements hurt SMEs more.
Building on initiatives to facilitate trade and recent trade agreements and better infrastructure,
reaping the full benefits of increased trade integration will also require reducing behind-theborder costs, streamlining the number of tariff bands, and lowering tariff and nontariff barriers.
Authorities’ views
48.
The authorities emphasize that they have a hierarchy of plans to achieve the vision
enshrined in the NDP, implemented through the MTSF. The NDP, which has primacy over
other plans, aims to eliminate poverty and inequality by 2030. In President Zuma’s words: “It is
our roadmap for the next 20 years. All the work we do in government is now part of the
comprehensive National Development Plan, including all operational plans, be they social,
economic or political.”35 The MTSF implements the NDP and provides indications of key
interventions that will be undertaken in the next five years, prioritizes policy actions, and
strengthens accountability. It focuses primarily on investing in infrastructure and boosting trade
and competition. Within the NDP vision, key policy instruments—the New Growth Path, which
focuses on creating decent jobs; the National Infrastructure Plan, which guides the roll-out of
infrastructure; and the Industrial Policy Action Plan, which focuses on promoting investment and
competitiveness in selected sectors—will continue to drive the government’s policy agenda. In
addition, the proposed socio-economic assessment of legislative initiatives will also enhance
policy consistency toward achieving the NDP objectives.
49.
The government is redoubling efforts to accelerate infrastructure projects and is
also exploring ways to increase private participation. Besides the R847bn infrastructure
projects planned for FY2013/14–2015/16, the authorities are committed to further invest in
electricity and explore alternative sources of energy, including nuclear, through Eskom, but
possibly also other entities. They are working on improving port capacity and upgrading and
35

Framework 2014-19”.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND 27

SOUTH AFRICA

expanding integrated public transport. Transnet’s locomotive and wagon fleets upgrade and
expansion programs are progressing as planned. The Infrastructure Development Act, which
came into effect on July 1, 2014, will fast-track the implementation of the National Infrastructure
Plan by establishing into law the Presidential Infrastructure Coordinating Commission, which
coordinates catalytic projects that can accelerate development and growth through the 18
Strategic Infrastructure Projects. The renewable energy independent power producer program
has been a success, considering the take-up and lower costs in successive rounds. This can be
expanded and diversified into gas, hydroelectric, coal and cross-border projects. To this end, the
government has constituted an infrastructure task team to identify constraints to private sector
participation in infrastructure.
50.
The authorities are well-aware of other structural challenges and have started
addressing them. The introduction of the Employment Tax Incentive scheme will improve the
employability of youth. Ongoing skills development programs, employment services, and recent
legislations regulating nonstandard employment, enhancing enforcement and compliance,
expediting dispute resolution, and protecting vulnerable workers will create decent jobs. In
May 2014, a new ministry dedicated to small business development was created to coordinate
government interventions to boost the SME sector. The Competition Commission has initiated
formal market inquiries to assess competition distortions, and a number of investigations into
the pricing of intermediate inputs are underway. Various interventions addressing competition
problems in telecommunications have resulted in a substantial reduction in retail prices. The
recently concluded EPA with the EU would boost South African exports, and the development of
special economic zones will help increase the value-added of exports.
51.
Concerning recommendations related to competition, the authorities point to
recent progress. For example, in the banking system, they argue that the top banks already
compete to a great extent and while a more competitive system is welcome, this is not possible
to achieve in the short to medium term, and may increase financial stability risks. Hence, they are
reluctant to reduce entry capital requirements, but are more open to supporting measures to
continue to lower bank charges and allow greater scope for alternative platforms, such as mobile
banking and community-based banks, to broaden financial access.

STAFF APPRAISAL
52.
South Africa has made impressive strides in its first two democratic decades, but
faces difficult challenges. Living standards have improved considerably. However, insideroutsider dynamics in product and labour markets, skill mismatches, and apartheid legacies have
kept unemployment unacceptably-high and the gains unequally shared. Besides a weak external
backdrop, domestic factors, including electricity shortages and tense industrial relations, are
increasingly holding back growth and job creation. The outlook remains lacklustre. Downside
risks prevail.

28

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

SOUTH AFRICA

53.
Structural reforms are imperative to ensure better growth and job prospects for all
citizens and reverse the inexorable rise in vulnerabilities. With past growth drivers having run
their course and constrained policy space, resolute and consistent action to lift structural
impediments is the only option for sustainable and inclusive growth that slashes unemployment,
poverty, and inequality. Structural reforms are also macro-critical and necessary to lower
vulnerabilities, increase the scope for countercyclical macro policies, and raise the economy’s
ability to rebalance toward exports and investment.
54.
The government’s focus on infrastructure is welcome, but needs to be accompanied
by a normalization of industrial relations and product and labor market reforms. Improving
critical infrastructure, especially electricity availability, is vital. With public balance sheets
stretched, greater private participation in infrastructure would help. Normalizing industrial
relations should be accorded high priority. The government’s enhanced focus on implementation
of the NDP is welcome and should be complemented by concomitant reforms to raise product
market competition and labor market inclusiveness in the context of a social bargain.
55.
The recently-announced 2014 MTBPS appropriately prioritizes the sustainability of
public finances, long-term growth, and core social services. The mix of revenue and
expenditure measures is well-balanced. Containing the wage bill is essential to achieve the
planned consolidation and so is an increase in taxes. Further adjustment may be necessary to
ensure public debt stabilizes and is reduced to safer levels. Greater spending efficiency would
improve public service delivery and the public sector contribution to sustainable growth. Plans to
strengthen SOEs’ efficiency and oversight are welcome.
56.
Monetary policy can remain accommodative for longer. The SARB has aptly balanced
elevated inflation and the weak economy. The recent decline in oil prices and the planned fiscal
consolidation may have given the SARB room to delay interest rate increases, which remain
needed over the medium term. In contrast, the re-emergence of inflation risks may require
higher interest rates sooner. Strong communication continues to be important to guide inflation
expectations.
57.
Given the challenging operating environment, the FSSA recommends heightened
scrutiny of credit and liquidity risks. Overall, financial sector risks and vulnerabilities are
elevated but manageable. Given the system’s large size and high interconnectedness, prolonged
weak growth and tightening financial conditions require intensified scrutiny of asset quality and
potential liquidity pressures. To this end, regular stress testing on a system-wide basis is
important to strengthen macroprudential supervision.
58.
The FSSA advises that the authorities’ reforms of the financial architecture should
include closing supervisory and regulatory gaps and strengthening the financial safety net.
Group-wide supervision, clear demarcation of accountability, and greater coordination among
supervisory authorities are needed. Introducing deposit insurance and enhancing regulation of
collective investment schemes could reduce liquidity risks and boost market discipline. The crisis

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND 29

SOUTH AFRICA

and resolution framework should be upgraded to give the SARB early intervention powers. And a
more competitive financial system could improve financial access and lower intermediation costs.
59.
South Africa’s flexible exchange rate regime remains a source of strength and
higher reserves and policies to achieve a more stable external financing mix would boost
resilience. The floating exchange rate regime and external debt largely in local currency have
helped manage external vulnerabilities against volatile capital flows. Higher reserves would
enhance South Africa’s preparedness for less benign global financial conditions. In addition,
improving the business environment, greater regulatory clarity, and increased private
participation in infrastructure projects could attract more FDI and reduce reliance on volatile
portfolio flows.

Twin Peaks Reform
Define clear and comprehensive institutional, governance and accountability arrangements

relevant institutions.
Publish a roadmap for regulatory reform, with adequate resource allocation, monitoring and
evaluation, to carefully implement the move to twin peaks and minimize transition risks.
Micro-prudential

intra-group transactions and aggregate exposures, and conduct joint on-site visits.
Clarify objectives and strengthen the operational independence of all financial sector
supervisors in the relevant legislation in line with international standards.
Enhance regulatory requirements of collective investment schemes (CIS), particularly for
disclosure, valuation and accounting, introduce variable net asset valuation for money market
funds, and strengthen the supervision of CIS managers.
Fully implement Solvency Assessment and Management and Treating Customers Fairly
initiatives; give high priority in legislation to protecting policyholder rights and entitlements.
Macro-prudential
Continue building a top-down stress test framework for the banking sector and give SARB
more resources for data collection and analysis.
Financial Safety Nets
Introduce a resolution regime compliant with the Key Attributes for, and make the SARB the

Annex I. The Authorities’ Development Plans


National Development Plan (NDP), 2012, (National Planning Commission,
http://www.npconline.co.za/pebble.asp?relid=25) is the government’s strategic plan. The NDP
aims at creating 11 million jobs by 2030, and sets growth and investment targets to achieve it. It
focuses on infrastructure, education/skill development, and better public service delivery to
reach these goals, and emphasizes that South Africa requires both a capable and developmental
state and “a vibrant and thriving private sector able to investment, employ people and penetrate
global markets.” It envisages “…professionalizing the public service, strengthening
accountability, improving coordination, and prosecuting corruption” as means.



Medium-Term Strategic Framework (MTSF), 2014, (Department of Planning, Monitoring and
Evaluation, http://www.thepresidency-dpme.gov.za/Pages/default.aspx) is the government's
framework to implement the NDP and the ANC’s 2014 election manifesto over 2014–19.1 The
MTSF targets reducing unemployment to 14 percent and raising investment to 25 percent of
GDP. In Minister Radebe’s words, “The aim of the MTSF is to ensure policy coherence, alignment
and coordination across government plans.” It maintains the focus on public infrastructure and
calls for increased dialogue between government and businesses. It aims at promoting SMEs
and strengthening competition.



Industrial Policy Action Plan (IPAP 2014/15, 6th annual edition) (Department of Trade and
Industry, http://www.dti.gov.za/industrial_development/industrial_development.jsp), focuses on
government intervention and trade policy to stimulate industrial development and diversify
exports. It supports “beneficiation” of natural resources as a national industrialization program,
and promotes creation of “decent work” and diversification of the economy through industrial
policy. Identified sectors include textile, metal processing, automobile, agro-processing, business
processing services etc.



New Growth Path (NGP, 2009) (Economic Development Department,
http://www.economic.gov.za/communications/publications/new-growth-path-series), identifies
key sectors to diversify and grow the economy and create “decent” jobs (5 million jobs by 2020).
The NGP starts by identifying where employment creation is possible. The sectors identified are:
infrastructure, the agricultural value chain, the mining value chain, the green economy,
manufacturing sectors included in IPAP 2 (metal fabrication, machinery and equipments etc.),
tourism, and certain high level services. It then analyses the policies and institutional
developments required to take advantage of these opportunities. To that end, it combines
macroeconomic and microeconomic interventions.

1

The ANC manifesto (http://www.anc.org.za/2014/anc-manifesto/together-we-move-south-africa-forward/) states
that achieving these goals requires “that we build a democratic developmental state capable of mobilizing all sectors
and boldly intervening in the economy in favor of workers and the poor.” Also, the manifesto states that “Within the
NDP vision, critical policy instruments will continue to drive government’s policy agenda,” and these policy
instruments include the NGP, the National Infrastructure Plan, and the IPAP.”

Annex II. External Sector Assessment
Overall Assessment

South Africa
Foreign asset
and liability
position and
trajectory

Background. Gross external debt has increased to 42 percent of GDP in 2014:Q2 from near 25 percent in 2009, but short-term
external debt (about 12 percent of GDP) remains manageable. About 55 percent of external debt is denominated in rand.
Nevertheless, a sudden stop of portfolio inflows remains an important source of vulnerability.

Current
account

Background. The CA deficit is projected at 5.7 percent of GDP in 2014 (5.6 percent of GDP cyclically adjusted), compared to
5.8 percent of GDP in 2013, on the back of weak exports (partly due to strikes), resilient imports and softer terms of trade. Export
and import volumes have started to adjust, reflecting lagged effects of the depreciation. However, South Africa’s competitiveness
problems and structural constraints hinder the CA adjustment. In addition, domestic demand has offered limited support to the
external rebalancing. Low saving coupled with robust public infrastructure investment is expected to keep the CA deficit elevated
over the medium term, notwithstanding the planned fiscal consolidation.

Assessment. The net IIP position (-6.1 percent of GDP in 2014:Q2) is relatively low and hence not a major source of risk, including
because it improves with depreciation. However, gross liabilities (126 percent of GDP) are large and the IIP position is expected to
deteriorate given the projected large current account (CA) deficits.

Assessment. EBA estimates a CA norm of -2.4 percent of GDP and a gap of -3.2 percent of GDP for 2014. Staff assesses the CA to
1
be 1½ to 3½ percentage points weaker than implied by medium-term fundamentals and desirable policy settings.
Real exchange
rate

Background. Since end-2010, the CPI-based REER has depreciated 26 percent. The average for January-September 2014 is 15
percent below its 10 year average. In contrast, the ULC-based REER, which reflects differences in domestic costs of production more
accurately, is near its 10-year average. While the EBA REER regression (which uses CPI-Based REER) estimates an undervaluation for
2014, other indicators, including the EBA CA gap estimate and South Africa’s declining share of world’s exports, continue pointing to
overvaluation.
2

Though it has started to adjust, the CA
deficit continues to be elevated and
mainly financed by non-FDI flows. The
real depreciation should boost net
exports, but structural problems are
slowing the CA adjustment. Low saving
relative to investment that is buoyed by
large infrastructure projects implies
substantial CA deficits over the medium
term. In spite of a favorable maturity
structure and currency denomination of
external debt, gross external financing
requirements are relatively high and
vulnerabilities are elevated. A slowdown
of capital inflows would complicate the
financing of the CA deficit and, if severe,
could induce a significant growth
slowdown.
Potential policy responses
Implementation of the authorities’
National Development Plan would help
improve competitiveness over the
medium term, but additional labor and

SOUTH AFRICA

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND 51

Assessment. Considering the more reliable CA gap estimate, the staff assesses the REER as overvalued by 5-20 percent. Gauging
the appropriate exchange rate for South Africa is challenging due to its structural changes since 1994 and high REER volatility; in
3
essence REER history provides little guidance. Also, the sensitivity of trade flows to the exchange rate movements appears lower
than implied by long-run elasticities—estimates of such elasticities are subject to high uncertainty due to structural changes. With
substantial lags, the weaker rand has started reducing the CA deficit, but structural factors will likely keep the external position
weaker than justified by fundamentals and desired policies over the medium term. Hence the exchange rate is still deemed
overvalued, but the extent of overvaluation is difficult to pinpoint.

The external position is weaker than
implied by desirable policy settings and
medium-term fundamentals.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

Background. FDI is lower than in most of South Africa’s peers, while portfolio and other investment flows, particularly foreign
purchases of local currency government bonds, have accounted for most of the financing of the CA deficit. In 2013 and in the first
half of 2014, unrecorded transactions financed a substantial part of the current account deficit.

FX intervention
and reserves

Background. South Africa’s exchange rate regime is one of the most flexible among EMs. Intervention is rare. Reserves cover five
months of imports (close to 80 percent of gross external financing needs), but are expected to remain slightly below the lower
bound of the IMF’s composite adequacy metric. Gold reserves account for about 10 percent of reserves.

Assessment. The risks posed by the reliance on non-FDI flows and nonresident financial holdings are significant but mitigated by
the floating exchange rate, the fact that the portfolio inflows go into long-term local currency bonds and equities, the large share of
index-tracking investors, and the large domestic institutional investor base. Nevertheless, a sharp slowdown or sudden stop of
capital inflows would complicate the financing of the external deficit, possibly prompting a disorderly adjustment.

Assessment. As financing conditions allow, reserve accumulation is desirable.

Technical
background
notes

1

The CA gap presented here results from the CA regression approach and the External Sustainability (ES) approach. The ES
approach compares the CA balance expected to prevail in the medium term with the one that would stabilize South Africa’s stock of
net foreign assets at its peers’ benchmark. According to this approach, to stabilize South Africa’s NFA at the peers’ level, South
Africa’s CA deficit would need to be less than 2 percent of GDP, compared to staff’s projection of a CA deficit between 4 and 5
percent of GDP over the medium term. The CA regression approach yields a gap for 2014 of 3.2 percent of GDP. Hence, the staff’s
gap range is centered on -2½ percent of GDP.
2

Using the CA gap range and applying a long-run elasticity would suggest an REER overvaluation of about 10-20 percent.
Considering the uncertainty regarding the elasticity and the possibility that it may be lower, but also the fact that CA has started to
adjust and hence some deficit reduction is in the pipeline, the range here is 5-20 percent.
3

The history of South Africa’s REER divides roughly into two periods and levels: before 2000 the average level was much higher than
the post-2000 average. Moreover the REER has fallen steeply over the last several years. In this context, REER regression-based
models such as EBA that use CPI-based REERs are very likely to point to current undervaluation, unless they can link the full
downward trend of the REER to deteriorating fundamentals. It appears that the level of the REER that is consistent with a given level
of the current account has declined over time, but empirical models are unable to explain this shift.

product market reforms that increase
competition and bring domestic costs in
line with productivity growth are
essential.
The planned fiscal consolidation and
modest monetary tightening are
expected to alleviate external
vulnerabilities. As financing conditions
allow, a build-up of reserves would
strengthen the country’s ability to deal
with FX liquidity shocks.
Increasing household saving will require
faster growth in household incomes
through much faster employment
growth, which in turn requires structural
reforms.

Annex III. Main Findings of the 2014 Financial System Stability
Assessment and its Macro-Financial Linkages1
The IMF 2014 FSSA concludes that financial sector risks and vulnerabilities are elevated but
manageable. South Africa’s financial system operates in a challenging economic environment,
characterized by low growth, high unemployment, and elevated twin deficits. Banks’ high reliance on
wholesale funding and large derivatives markets, combined with elevated external vulnerability, make
South Africa susceptible to contagion and sudden stops of capital flows. Nevertheless, relatively high
capital buffers, sound regulation and supervision, and capital controls on non-bank financial
institutions (NBFIs) mean risks are currently manageable. This annex provides an overview of the
FSSA assessment of financial sector risks and how they interact with the broader economy.

A. Financial Industry Structure
South Africa’s financial sector is large and highly concentrated. Financial sector assets amount to
about 300 percent of GDP. The top five

minimum capital requirements for banks are
between 4 and 100 times higher than in EM countries. Also, access to clearance and payments
systems and regulatory and supervisory gaps favor incumbents. Certain bank charges have been
reduced and pricing has become more transparent since the Competition Commission’s 2008
Banking Enquiry, but more competition among financial institutions could result in a greater supply
of financial services at lower intermediation costs, especially for SMEs and lower income households.

B. Interconnectedness

A Highly Interconnected Financial System

South Africa’s financial system is also highly
interconnected. All major banks are affiliated with
insurance companies that underwrite a substantial
proportion of private pension assets, and some banks
own asset management companies that offer money
market funds and provide the bulk of banks’
wholesale funding together with other NBFIs. This
exposes NBFIs to significant counterparty risks and
banks to liquidity risks. There are substantial levels of
related party transactions within financial groups.

C. Credit Risk
Owing to elevated households’ indebtedness and
banks’ large exposure to households, the main
source of credit risk is banks’ retail portfolios,
despite the recent increase stemming from
corporates, which overall continue to have robust
balance sheets and profitability. FSSA stress tests
conclude that banks and insurance companies are
resilient to severe shocks, reflecting relatively high
capital (Tier 1 capital 13.5 percent in June 2014.)

Simple regressions confirm that NPL ratios of mortgages and unsecured credit are positively related
with the policy rate and unemployment, while inversely correlated with GDP growth and employee
compensation. Policy rates increases have a significant impact on the asset quality of mortgages, but
not on unsecured credit, likely because the interest rate on unsecured credit is capped by regulation,
though high.
Hence, protracted low growth and higher interest rates could lead to a deterioration in asset quality,
especially from highly-indebted households. SMEs are also relatively more susceptible to tighter
financial conditions and downturns than larger firms, as their profitability is typically weaker. Tighter
financial conditions, in turn, have a significant impact on activity, creating a negative feedback loop.3
Households
Leverage, especially among low and middle-income households, increased significantly in the run-up
to the global financial crisis, and remains high historically and compared to other EMs. In the 2000s,
mortgage lending grew substantially, followed by a rapid expansion of unsecured lending. The share
of households with impaired records has increased to nearly half. African bank, a small bank
specializing in unsecured lending, was placed under curatorship in August 2014 after reporting
record losses. Also, 48 percent of new mortgages, and 35 percent of mortgages outstanding, have
loan-to-value (LTV) ratios above 80 percent, leaving banks with a relatively small collateral buffers.

Overall corporate leverage is low by international comparisons. Though return on assets and interest
coverage ratio (ICR) have recently declined, profitability is still healthy, partly because large firms
typically benefit from significant market power. Corporate debt to equity at 48 percent is low.
However, a few state-owned enterprises (SOEs) have significantly increased their leverage (much of it
in foreign currency) mainly to fund large infrastructure projects. Contingent liabilities from SOEs

Unsecured loans are defined as the SARB’s unsecured lending to retail counterparties, which includes credit cards,

constitute a fiscal risk that could weigh on the sovereign’s creditworthiness with spillovers to all
South African borrowers, including financial institutions. Other fiscal risks are also considerable and
would similarly have adverse feedback loop effects on the financial system.
The FSSA corporate stress tests suggest that borrowing cost increases and earning declines would
have a significant impact on SOEs’ debt-servicing capacity, while private firms would fare reasonably
well. While all SOEs are required to hedge their currency, interest rate, and commodity price risks,
tighter financial conditions could increase their cost of funding and hedging. Nevertheless, the risks
from SOEs to the whole corporate sector remain contained as private firms account for over two
thirds of the South African corporate sector (86 percent of total corporate sector assets).

D. Liquidity and Market Risks
Wholesale funding—mostly short-term and from domestic NBFIs—accounts for about 50 percent of
total. This, together with relatively high loan to deposit ratio (127 percent), makes it challenging for
South African banks to meet Basel III liquidity

South Africa’s external vulnerability exposes it to

the flexible exchange rate and external debt

mainly denominated in rand are important
mitigating factors. Sizable foreign holdings (about a third) in deep local capital markets (345 percent
of GDP capitalization), a deep over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives market (notional value of about 9
times GDP), and the rand being used as an EM proxy are key conduits for global risks. Although
banks’ net FX positions are small and banks themselves do not rely heavily on external funding,
sharply higher global risk aversion could spillover to domestic markets and push banks’ funding and
hedging costs higher. Banks are also exposed indirectly to shocks that affect NBFIs’ asset values,
especially a decline in equity prices, as equities account for over half of their portfolios.

The FSAA concludes that despite high short-term liabilities, the impact of higher interest rates on
banks’ capital ratios is modest, as the majority of the loans are at floating rates. However, the impact
would be felt indirectly via deteriorating asset quality.

E. Supervision and Regulation
Regulation and supervision of banks and insurance are overall sound. The South African Reserve
Bank is a proactive supervisor, with a high level of compliance with international standards on
effective banking supervision. Insurance companies are also well regulated. Collective investment
schemes, which have grown rapidly in recent years, are lightly regulated. The authorities are in the
process of carrying out a major reform of the regulatory architecture, based on a twin peaks model.

South Africa has consented to the quota increase under the 14th General Review of Quotas which
will essentially double the IMF’s quota resources, once effective. South Africa also accepted the
proposed amendment to reform the Executive Board. The quota increases will become effective
once the proposed amendment to reform the Executive Board enter into force, which occurs once
the Fund certifies that three-fifths of the IMF members (i.e., 113 members out of the currently 188)
having 85 percent of the total voting power have accepted the proposed amendment.1 South
Africa’s quota under the 14th General Review will increase to SDR 3,051.2 million (R 38.6 billion).
In September 2010, South Africa also agreed to lend the IMF up to SDR 340 million (R 4.3 billion)
under the New Arrangements to Borrow (NAB). The NAB is a set of credit arrangements the IMF has
with 40 member countries and/or its institutions. Currently 37 of these arrangements are active and
thus can be drawn by the IMF to supplement its quota resources for lending purposes. South Africa
is paid interest on its loans to the IMF under the NAB based on the SDR interest rate. As of end-May,
South Africa had lent SDR 41.2 million (R 570.8 million) to the IMF under the NAB.
In 2012, the South African pledged $2 billion (R16.8 billion) to boost IMF resources, as part of a
global drive to help strengthen global economic and financial stability. Subsequently, a bilateral
borrowing agreement between the South African Reserve Bank (SARB) and the IMF has been
approved by the IMF’s Executive Board.
Exchange rate arrangement
The rand floats against other currencies, and South Africa maintains an exchange system
consistent with South Africa’s obligations under Article VIII of the IMF’s Articles of
Agreement. 2 South Africa’s de jure exchange rate arrangement is free floating, and the de facto
arrangement is floating. Its exchange system is free of multiple currency practices and restrictions on
the making of payments and transfers for current international transactions. South Africa has
continued to gradually liberalize the system of capital controls in place since the apartheid regime.
With the abolition of the financial rand in 1995, all exchange controls on nonresidents were
eliminated. Nonresidents are free to purchase shares, bonds, and other assets and to repatriate
dividends, interest receipts, and current and capital profits, as well as the original investment capital.
Foreign companies, African governments, and institutions may list equity and debt instruments on
South Africa’s securities exchanges.

1

The two additional conditions for the proposed quota increases to become effective have already been met, i.e., the
entry into force of the Voice and Participation Amendment of the Fund’s Articles of Agreement and the consent of
members having not less than 70 percent of the total quotas (as of November 5, 2010) to the increase in their
quotas.

South Africa accepted the Article VIII, Section 2(a), 3, and 4 obligations in 1973.

Exchange controls on capital transactions by residents have been gradually relaxed. The
authorities’ main objective has been to move toward a system based on prudential limits and
supervision, and away from a rigid system of quantitative controls. Box 1 above summarizes recent
measures.
Article IV consultation
The 2013 Article IV consultation was concluded by the Executive Board on July 31, 2013. South Africa
is on the standard 12-month Article IV consultation cycle.
Technical assistance
An IMF Fiscal Affairs Department (FAD) mission took place in December 2010 to support capacity for
fiscal policy analysis in the Treasury’s Fiscal Policy Unit (FPU). In July 2011, senior FPU staff visited the
IMF’s headquarters to discuss international experience with fiscal rules. In March 2012, an FAD team
visited Pretoria to discuss room for further improvement in South Africa’s strong budget institutions.
In November 2012, an FAD-arranged mission by two external experts visited Pretoria to discuss the
forthcoming Long-term Fiscal Report, and in April 2013, a TA mission visited Cape Town to support
the authorities in the establishment of a new Parliamentary Budget Office (PBO).
An FAD mission visited Pretoria In August 2013 to discuss options for the National Treasury to
strengthen their performance management systems. In December 2013, the National Treasury and
FAD held a joint workshop on fiscal risks. In June 2014, FAD missions provided advice on
expenditure reviews and on options for further strengthening the PBO, while a mission visited the
South African Revenue Service (SARS) to conduct a pilot of the Tax Administration Diagnostic
Assessment Tool (TADAT). A FAD mission on VAT gaps took place in August 2014.
In March 2011, an STA mission took place to conduct the training on the Coordinated Direct
Investment Survey for Anglophone Africa in Pretoria.
In May 2014, an MCM mission took place to conduct the training on banking sector stress test for
the SARB.
A number of IMF Legal Department (LEG) missions in 2007–09 assisted the authorities in the
ongoing process of rewriting the Income Tax Act and drafting a new Tax Administration Act. The
recent LEG mission took place in November 2008, and a report on this mission was completed in
late 2009. LEG has submitted comments on the Tax Administration Act to the authorities by email.

THE JMAP WORLD BANK IMF MATRIX
The IMF South Africa team led by Ms. Laura Papi (mission chief) met with the World Bank South
Africa team led by Mr. Asad Alam (country director) on September 22, 2014, to discuss macrocritical
structural issues and to coordinate the two teams’ work for October 2014–September 2015.
The teams agreed that South Africa’s macroeconomic challenges include promoting job creation
and improving the long-run inclusive growth needed for maintaining social cohesion. In addition,
they noted the increased vulnerabilities, especially external, that pose risks to macroeconomic
stability.
Based on this shared assessment, the IMF and the World Bank agreed to support the authorities’
efforts on the following macrocritical fronts with these specific actions:


Fiscal sustainability: The IMF will continue its engagement with the authorities on South
Africa’s long-term fiscal challenges and risks as part of the surveillance dialogue. The debt
sustainability analysis is being done according to the new guidelines, which focus on risk-based
analysis. The IMF will provide advice on managing fiscal risks, and stands ready to share work by
FAD on health care reform and seek opportunities, such as workshops with the authorities, to
discuss options for the design of reforms in this area and will continue to inform the authorities
of best practices from other countries in terms of modeling the implications of health and social
security reforms.



Improvements in the composition of public spending: The World Bank is providing technical
assistance for ongoing efforts to strengthen government-wide monitoring and evaluation
systems and has conducted a public expenditure tracking survey for health-related spending in
the province of Kwa-Zulu Natal.



Debt and foreign exchange management: Partnering with the South African Reserve Bank
(SARB), the World Bank has been supporting efforts in the area of the foreign currency reserves
management (including enhancement of SARB’s governance and risk management frameworks
as well as its investment operations and systems infrastructure), and by supporting the National
Treasury in preparing the debt management strategy, reviewing strategic benchmarks and
improving the secondary debt market architecture. Also, a new partnership with the Public
Investment Corporation (PIC), which manages public assets, will focus on strengthening all
aspects of investment operations and infrastructure



Strengthened public infrastructure: The Eskom Investment Support Project ($3.75 billion IBRD
loan) and the Eskom Renewable Energy Support Project ($250 Clean Technology Fund), both
being implemented by the World Bank, support the expansion of electricity supply and help
South Africa accelerate development of renewable energy generation capacity.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

SOUTH AFRICA



Product market reforms: The World Bank supports ongoing dialogue on rural development
and land reform through reimbursable advisory services aiming to address some of the unique
challenges of the country such as accelerating land reform, exploring effective model to support
land reform and smallholder agriculture, and promote nonfarm rural enterprises development
for job opportunities and social equity.



Tackling high inequality: Recognizing South Africa’s exceptionally high levels of exclusion, the
World Bank has just completed a report on the township economy in South Africa. Poor
education outcomes have been flagged as key determinant hampering inclusive growth, and the
World Bank is currently engaging with the Department of Basic Education to strengthen the
annual national assessments in order to improve teaching and learning in schools. Additionally,
vocational training, particularly for low-income youths, is a strategic priority for the IFC in SubSaharan Africa. It will explore the possibility of supporting private sector for- and nonprofit
technical education in South Africa, with the aim of: (i) increasing employment opportunities; (ii)
raising the productivity of South African firms; and (iii) improving income distribution, given the
significant returns to education in the country. In the 6th Economic Update on South Africa due
to be released November 4, the World Bank has assessed the impact of various taxes and social
spending on measures poverty and inequality rates, fiscal policy on poverty and inequality.



Financial sector stability and inclusion: The IMF concluded the Financial Sector Stability
Assessment. At the request of the National Treasury and SARB, the World Bank is reviewing
South Africa’s contingency planning and crisis management framework, assessing the
institutional set-up of financial sector supervision, and carrying out a Review of Standards and
Codes (RoSC) on Insolvency and Creditor Rights. The Bank is also working with an
interministerial working group that is assessing strategic priorities for financial inclusion. The
World Bank is preparing a US$100 million financial intermediation loan to the Land Bank of
South Africa in support of wholesale financing targeting emerging black farmers. A World Bank
study will address the poverty and social impact of mobile financial services in Southern Africa.



Private investment program: Promotion of private investment and job creation is at the top of
the government agenda, and activities by the IBRD, IFC and MIGA will remain central to this
program. The IBRD will continue its support for economic diversification and micro, small and
medium enterprise (MSME) development, including technical assistance to the Department of
Trade and Industry in promoting MSME development in poorer regions, as well support for
enhancement of policies aiming at improving Research and Development efficiency. The IFC’s
strategy in South Africa will remain focused on innovation, job creation, and poverty reduction
by: (i) supporting South African companies “going north” and “going global”; (ii) providing
advice and financing in underserved niches of the South African market where IFC can add
value; (iii) providing technical assistance and related support for small business, with a focus on
the informal sector and education; and (iv) supporting the development of renewable energy
and energy efficiency projects.

STATISTICAL ISSUES
Data provided to the IMF are adequate for surveillance. South Africa subscribed to the Special Data
Dissemination Standard (SDDS) on August 2, 1996, and is in observance of specifications for
coverage, periodicity, and timeliness of data, although using a flexibility option on the timeliness
and periodicity of unemployment data. A Report on Observance of Standards and Codes—Data
Module, Response by the Authorities, and Detailed Assessments Using the Data Quality Assessment
Framework (DQAF) was published on October 16, 2001.
Real sector statistics
The national accounts are compiled according to the SNA 1993. In 2009, the base year of the
national accounts was changed from 2000 to 2005. At the same time, benchmarking was undertaken
to reflect more accurately the structure of the economy and to introduce other methodological
changes to the compilation of data. Reporting of real sector data for International Financial Statistics
(IFS) is timely. Statistics South Africa and the SARB are in the process of compiling GDP data
according to SNA2008, with a new base year of 2010. The new GDP data from the production and
income approaches are expected to be published on November 25, 2014.
Quarterly labor market statistics are published one month after the end of the previous quarter.
Given the seriousness of the unemployment problem, labor market analysis and policy design would
benefit from better and more frequent labor market data. A new quarterly Labor Force Survey has
been conducted since January 2008.
The consumer price index (CPI) covers all households living in metropolitan and urban areas, which
represent approximately 61 percent of the total number of households based on the 2010/11
Income and Expenditure Survey . The current CPI weights were derived primarily from Stats SA’s
household expenditure survey. Current price indices, which were rebased to December 2012=100,
are calculated according to these weights. These indices form the basis for calculating the year-onyear changes in the CPI for 2013 and the month-on-month change between January 2013 and
December 2012. The historical rates of inflation are not revised backward.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

SOUTH AFRICA

Government finance statistics
Data for the Government Finance Statistics Yearbook and IFS are compiled and disseminated
according to the Government Finance Statistics Manual 2001 framework. Data for social security
funds and central government’s extra budgetary funds have been reported on an accrual basis,
starting in 2000 and 2002, respectively. Starting in 2005, the authorities have included additional
noncash data for other levels of government, consistent with their migration to accrual reporting.
South Africa currently reports data for the consolidated general government for publication in the
Government Finance Statistics Yearbook. It also reports monthly data covering the cash operations
of the budgetary central government for publication in IFS.
Monetary statistics
Monetary statistics compiled by the SARB are consistent with the methodology of the Monetary and
Financial Statistics Manual. South Africa reports regular and good quality monetary statistics for
publication in the IFS, although there is room for improving the timeliness of the data on other
financial corporations.
Balance of payments statistics
Balance of payments data are broadly consistent with the fifth edition of the Balance of Payments
Manual (BPM5). The authorities have improved the coverage of trade flows within the Southern
African Customs Union (SACU) in late 2013. Data reported to Direction of Trade Statistics still differ
from external trade data reported to IFS. The authorities plan to release the balance of payments
and international investment position data in BPM6 format at the end of 2014.
Data on the international reserves position are disseminated in line with the requirements of the
IMF’s template on international reserves and foreign currency liquidity. In late 2014 the authorities
started to report quarterly data on the international investment position.
Work is ongoing to improve the reliability and accuracy of balance of payments data, with the aim
of reducing errors and omissions. It would also be useful to disseminate a detailed breakdown of
financial account data pertaining to other investment assets and liabilities.

STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2014 ARTICLE IV
November 17, 2014

CONSULTATION—DEBT SUSTAINABILITY ANALYSIS
Approved By

Anne-Marie Gulde-Wolf
and Vivek Arora

Prepared by the Staff Representatives for the 2014 Article IV
Consultation with South Africa

The increase in government debt to 46 percent of GDP in FY2013/14 from 27 percent
of GDP in FY2008/09 has raised fiscal risks. Recognizing this fact, the 2014 MediumTerm Budget Policy Statement (MTBPS) announced a package of fiscal measures aimed
at narrowing the deficit and stabilizing debt. Notwithstanding these measures, this
debt sustainability analysis (DSA) suggest that the debt ratio may continue to rise over
the projection horizon, albeit more slowly than in recent years. Also, further negative
shocks represent a significant risk to the debt and financing outlook. In particular, a
realization of contingent liabilities from state-owned enterprises (SOEs) could push
debt above the DSA 70 percent of GDP high-risk threshold, and the debt-to-GDP ratio
could exceed 60 percent if the economy were buffeted by a permanent growth or
combined macro-fiscal shock. In addition, South Africa’s gross financing need are
projected to remain elevated and exceed the high risk 15 percent of GDP threshold
under several of the shock scenarios considered in the analysis. Risks to the fiscal
outlook have increased since the 2013 Article IV consultation, but South Africa’s public
debt remains sustainable under staff’s baseline as the fiscal package announced in the
2014 MTBPS is expected to mitigate some of these risks and the maturity and currency
composition of South Africa’s debt is favorable.

SOUTH AFRICA

PUBLIC DEBT SUSTAINABILITY ANALYSIS1
1. Macroeconomic assumptions. Real GDP growth is projected at 1.4 percent in 2014 but is expected to
increase to 2.1 percent in 2015 and 2.5 percent in 2016 as a result of some normalization in labor relations
and easing supply constraints. Over the medium term, growth is projected at around 2.8 percent. The GDP
deflator is expected to average around 5½ percent, consistent with CPI inflation close to the upper range
of the South Africa Reserve Bank’s (SARB) 3–6 percent target range.
2. Fiscal assumptions. The FY2014/15 national government primary fiscal deficit is projected to
deteriorate to 2 percent from 1.8 percent in FY2013/14 as growth continues to disappoint. The package of
revenue and expenditure measures outlined in the 2014 MTBPS is expected to result in a gradual
narrowing of the primary deficit over the medium term. The amount of consolidation is, however, not
expected to be sufficient to stabilize the debt-to-GDP ratio, which is projected to rise to 57 percent of GDP
by 2019. Consistent with the MTBPS, the projections include stock-flow adjustments to capture the practice
of paying interest on bonds at the coupon rather than the market interest rate as well as valuation effects
on inflation-linked and FX bonds. The projections do not assume any additional fiscal measures that the
2014 MTBPS has signaled could be considered if necessary to achieve the government’s fiscal objectives.
3. Data coverage. Consistent with the data on government debt reported by the authorities, the fiscal
assumptions in this DSA are based on the national government’s main budget. While this coverage
excludes provincial governments, social security funds, and extra-budgetary institutions, these entities are
not allowed to incur debt. Moreover, most provincial and municipal expenditure is funded through
transfers from the national government and thus is already captured in the projections. The DSA also
excludes SOEs, whose indebtedness has increased rapidly in recent years. Around 45 percent of SOEs’
borrowing is covered by government guarantees and the DSA therefore includes an analysis of the fiscal
impact of the realization of these contingent liabilities.
4. An expanded debt sustainability analysis is warranted given South Africa’s elevated gross
financing needs. Gross financing needs (GFN) are estimated at 12.8 percent of GDP in 2013 and expected
to peak at 13.4 percent in 2014, above the 10 percent of GDP trigger based on a conservative assessment
of early-warning results.
5. There is no evidence of a systemic projection bias that would undermine the assessment of
sustainability. The median forecast errors for real GDP growth, the primary balance, and the GDP deflator
between 2005–13 are below 1 percent and in line with other countries.
6. Cross-country experience suggests the fiscal adjustment assumed in the DSA is feasible. The
maximum three-year adjustment in the cyclically-adjusted primary balance over the projection period
(1.1 percent of GDP) as well as the maximum three-year level of the cyclically-adjusted primary balance (0.5

percent of GDP) is moderate when compared to the experience in market access countries with debt above
60 percent of GDP.
7. National government primary deficits averaging 2¼ percent of GDP for the past four fiscal
years have resulted in rising debt ratios and higher GFNs. Substantial fiscal stimulus helped cushion the
impact of the global economic slowdown on the economy, but also contributed to a 19 percentage point
increase in the debt-to-GDP ratio since 2008. Elevated deficits have brought the GFN to about 13 percent
of GDP, above the EM average notwithstanding a favorable maturity structure.
8. The fiscal outlook is subject to several downside risks. With initial wage demands at 15 percent,
there is a risk that a higher-than-budgeted public sector wage settlement puts upward pressure on
spending. The government’s plans for nuclear energy and a national health insurance could also
significantly increase spending pressures. At the same time, the weak state of SOEs’ balance sheets could
trigger calls for further government’s support, while a tightening of global financial conditions could put
upward pressure on borrowing costs.
9. The DSA framework suggests South Africa’s government debt-to-GDP ratio is sustainable in the
baseline scenario, but remains vulnerable to shocks.


The framework uses an indicative 70 percent of GDP debt benchmark beyond which a country is
reported as high risk (red in the standardized heat map). The benchmark is based on a crosscountry early-warning exercise of emerging market countries that have experienced episodes of
debt distress.2



Under the baseline, the debt-to-GDP ratio is projected to increase to 57 percent by 2019. This is
29 percentage points higher than in 2007, but below the 70 percent high-risk threshold.



The projected debt level in 2019 increases to slightly above 60 percent of GDP if none of the
envisaged fiscal consolidation materializes and the primary balance remains unchanged, or with
a one-standard-deviation temporary shock to growth.



A customized shock entailing a permanent reduction in growth—growth remains at the 2014
level throughout the projection horizon—results in a significant increase in debt to around 66
percent of GDP.



A macro-fiscal shock—including standard shocks to growth and interest rates, and a primary
balance shock (a temporary half of a 10-year historical standard deviation deterioration in the
primary balance) and an exchange rate shock (consistent with the maximum movement over the

events, or IMF financing.

past 10 years and an exchange rate pass-through of 0.25 based on cross-country estimates of
pass-through in EMs)—results in a sharp increase in the debt-to-GDP ratio to 68 percent. 3


A contingent liability shock where 75 percent of the government’s guarantee commitments—
estimated at 14 percent of GDP in FY2013/14—is realized would increase debt to 72 percent of
GDP, slightly above the high risk threshold. While extreme, this exercise serves to underscore the
growing risks posed by contingent liabilities from SOEs, both to the fiscal outlook directly and
indirectly through its potential impact on investor confidence.



The DSA also includes fan charts that take into account the impact of the historical volatility of
macro-fiscal variables on the future debt path. Both an asymmetric version that reflects the
predominance of downside risks, and a symmetric version that takes into account the possibility
of more rapid progress on structural reforms that would boost growth and improve the primary
balance, yield similar results to the afore-mentioned stress tests, with the former suggesting
there is a 10 percent chance that the debt-to-GDP ratio could exceed the DSA high-risk
threshold of 70 percent of GDP by 2019.

10. The heat map suggests that despite its low share of foreign currency and short-term debt,
South Africa faces risks relating to its GFN and its debt profile. Even in the baseline, South Africa’s GFN
is close to the 15 percent of GDP benchmark that is considered to be high risk. The standard shocks to
growth and the primary balance, as well as the contingent liability shock, the permanent growth shock, and
the combined macro-fiscal shock—would push the GFN above the high risk benchmark, indicating an
increased risk of financing difficulties. South Africa’s local currency bond spread and the relatively large
share of debt held by non-residents also point to emerging risks, though the large domestic institutional
investor base and capital controls on residents are mitigating factors. These findings are consistent with
staff’s assessment that while South Africa’s debt remains sustainable, risks to the fiscal outlook have
increased since the 2013 Article IV consultation, even after taking into account the consolidation measures
announced in the MTBPS.

EXTERNAL DEBT SUSTAINABILITY ANALYSIS
11. Increasing public indebtedness has contributed most to the build-up of external debt
since 2011. Albeit from a low base, the stock of

Total external debt approached 42 percent of GDP
1/ As of end-June, 2014.
at the end of 2014:Q2.
12. South Africa’s external debt is projected to increase to 52 percent of GDP by 2019. The
rise in the external debt-to-GDP ratio over the medium term mainly reflects the elevated noninterest current account deficit (CAD), which is projected to average 2.7 percent of GDP during this
period compared to an estimated debt-stabilizing non-interest CAD of 2 percent of GDP (Table 1).
13. The gradual normalization of global interest rates is expected to worsen the income
deficit, but the stock of fixed-rate liabilities with long maturity provides some relief. Using
WEO projections of global interest rates, we estimate a worsening of the net income balance by
about ½ percent of GDP over the medium term. Existing public fixed-rate bonds with a long
duration will help contain the impact of higher global rates on future debt service. Transfers to the
Southern Africa Customs Union (SACU) are projected to remain slightly below 1 percent of GDP, in
line with the historical average.
14. South Africa’s gross external financing need (GEFN) is projected to average 18 percent of
GDP in 2014-2019 compared to 13 percent of GDP in the past five years. Short-term external
debt (on a residual maturity basis) is estimated to account for about 70 percent of the GEFN during
the projection period, most of it in the form of banking and corporate loans which tend to have a
shorter original maturity than public debt. With net FDI having averaged 0.8 percent of GDP in 201013, the GEFN is expected to be mostly financed by portfolio and other investment liabilities, in line
with the recent past (each have averaged 1½ percent of GDP in 2010-13, while unrecorded
transactions averaged 0.7 percent of GDP during the same period). The share of FX-denominated
debt is projected to remain stable at 45 percent of total external debt.
15. Rising indebtedness and sizable rollover needs keep South Africa’s external vulnerability
elevated, but external debt rises only modestly under a number of shocks scenarios. Stress
tests indicate that a 30 percent exchange rate depreciation would push the debt-to-GDP ratio above
67 percent (mainly due to a larger compression in the US$-denominated GDP than in the trade
deficit). Other standard shocks applied in the external DSA—such as a further widening of the noninterest CAD, a growth deceleration, and an interest rate increase—would lead to a relatively mild
increase in external debt. These shocks are partially contained due to the sizeable share of randdenominated and fixed-interest-rate debt.

Statement by the Staff Representative on South Africa
December 3, 2014
This statement contains information that has become available since the staff report was
circulated to the Executive Board. This information does not alter the thrust of the staff
appraisal.
1.
The latest national accounts data confirm that the economy is recovering from
the strikes, though growth remains sluggish. Real GDP growth increased to 1.4 percent
q/q in 2014: Q3 from 0.5 percent in Q2 (seasonally adjusted and annualized), underpinned
by improvements in wholesale and retail trade and mining, while manufacturing output still
contracted. The new data are in line with staff projections of 1.4 percent growth for 2014,
which will require a full recovery of the manufacturing and mining sectors from the
disruptions in production that occurred earlier in the year.
2.
The rebasing of the national accounts has lead to modest revisions to historical
data, with no significant policy implications.

3.
Weaker-than-anticipated trade and budget balance data in October confirm
that South Africa’s twin deficits are likely to remain elevated. The October trade deficit
increased to its highest level since 2010, mostly on account of a sharp increase in crude oil
imports and declining commodity prices. The October increase in the national government
budget deficit was driven by a drop in non-tax revenue and quarterly transfers to SACU

2
countries. The new data are broadly in line with staff projections of a current account deficit
around 5½ percent of GDP and fiscal deficit around 4¼ percent of GDP in 2014.
4.
Inflation pressures remain contained. CPI inflation was flat at 5.9 percent y/y in
October, staying inside the SARB’s inflation band for the second consecutive month. Food
inflation continued to fall and inflation momentum also moderated in sequential terms.
These developments remain in line with staff projections.
5.
The South Africa Reserve Bank (SARB) kept the policy rate on hold in its
November 20 Monetary Policy Committee Meeting. Citing the lower trajectory of
headline inflation, falling oil prices, and the continued weak state of the economy, the SARB
concluded that risks to inflation are broadly balanced and reduced its 2015 inflation
projection to 5.3 percent (staff 5.2 percent). It nevertheless reiterated that exchange rate
depreciation and wage negotiations remain the main sources of upside risks to inflation. The
SARB maintained that interest rates will have to normalize over time, and that the timing of
future interest rate increases will depend on the evolution of inflation expectations, the
speed of U.S. monetary policy normalization, and the state of the domestic economy.

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2014 Article IV Consultation with South Africa
On December, 3, 2014, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund concluded the
Article IV consultation1 with South Africa.
South Africa has made substantial progress in its first 20 years of democracy, achieving much
improved living standards for its citizens. But growth has slowed in recent years, specifically
relative to other emerging markets. Although weak trading partners’ growth contributed to the
slowdown, increasingly binding structural constraints, such as protracted strikes and electricity
constraints, have been important factors. Unemployment remains high at 25.5 percent.
Consumer Price Index (CPI) inflation declined to 5.9 percent in September after staying above
the South African Reserve Bank (SARB)’s 3-6 percent band for six months, mainly driven by
depreciation. The SARB has raised the repo rate by 75 basis points since January 2014.
South Africa’s twin deficits remain elevated. Despite a 26 percent real effective exchange rate
depreciation since 2010, the current account deficit remains high (5.8 percent of Gross Domestic
Product (GDP) in 2013), reflecting persistent competitiveness problems, soft terms of trade,
supply bottlenecks, and subdued external demand. Notwithstanding expenditure discipline, the
general government budget deficit was 4.5 percent of GDP in 2013, and public debt rose to 45
percent of GDP from 27 percent in 2008. In the recently-announced Medium-Term Budget
Policy Statement, the authorities have announced that they will take measures to improve the
public finances.
The Financial System Stability Assessment (FSSA) concluded that financial sector risks are
elevated but manageable. The financial system is large, highly interconnected, dependent on
wholesale funding, and credit risk is rising due to sluggish growth and tighter financial

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with members, usually
every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial information, and discusses with officials
the country's economic developments and policies. On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which
forms the basis for discussion by the Executive Board.

2
conditions. However, capital buffers are relatively high, financial regulation and supervision are
strong, and capital controls limit liquidity risks.
The outlook is lackluster with considerable risks. Growth is projected to slow to 1.4 percent in
2014 and rebound only modestly to 2.1 percent in 2015 on improved industrial relations, while
private consumption remains depressed under tighter financial conditions. Slowly easing
infrastructure constraints and stronger external demand are expected to raise growth to 2.75
percent in 2016–19 but not enough to lower unemployment significantly. Fiscal and current
account deficits are expected to fall moderately over the medium term. Inflation is projected to
decline in 2015 on account of lower oil and food prices and tighter policies. Structural reforms
are essential to generate more growth and jobs and to address the challenges of poverty,
inequality, and unemployment.
Risks are tilted to the downside. A sharp surge in global financial market volatility could lead to
capital flow reversals and trigger a disorderly adjustment in the current account deficit. Lower
global growth and commodity prices, further delays in relieving electricity constraints, and more
labor market disruptions are additional key risks.
Executive Board Assessment2
Executive Directors commended the authorities for the progress made in improving living
standards and for maintaining macroeconomic stability in the last twenty years. However, against
the backdrop of a weak external environment, the country is faced with the challenges from
elevated external and fiscal deficits, rising public debt, and high unemployment and inequality.
Directors agreed that strong and prudent policies and structural reforms are key to strengthening
economic resilience, boosting inclusive and sustainable growth, creating jobs, and reducing
poverty.
Given the risks facing the outlook and reduced policy space, Directors called for decisive
structural reforms to unblock supply-side constraints, lift growth, and rebalance the economy
towards exports and investments. They welcomed the ongoing infrastructure projects, especially
in power supply, and encouraged greater private sector participation, supported by careful
preparation and sound frameworks. Directors commended the government’s enhanced focus on
implementing the National Development Plan and promoting SMEs. They recommended that
high priority be given to enhancing productivity and competitiveness by accelerating product and
labor market reforms, reducing skill mismatches, and normalizing industrial relations.

At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the Board, summarizes the views of
Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the country's authorities. An explanation of any qualifiers
used in summings up can be found here: http://www.imf.org/external/np/sec/misc/qualifiers.htm.

3
Directors welcomed the envisaged fiscal consolidation in the 2014 Medium-Term Budget Policy
Statement, and highlighted that containing the wage bill and raising taxes will be essential. They
noted that further adjustment may be necessary to stabilize debt over the medium term, and in
this context, underscored the importance of focusing on growth-friendly measures, including
improvements in spending efficiency. They welcomed plans to increase state-owned enterprises’
efficiency so as to limit contingent liabilities. A few Directors noted that a formal debt anchor
could strengthen the fiscal framework.
Directors commended the South African Reserve Bank (SARB) for a finely balanced monetary
policy stance. While recent declines in oil prices and the planned fiscal consolidation could allow
the SARB to remain accommodative for some time, risks to the inflation outlook need continued
careful monitoring. In general, Directors highlighted the importance of effective communication
to help guide inflation expectations.
Directors viewed exchange rate flexibility and the favorable currency composition of external
debt as effective buffers against volatile capital flows. To boost resilience, they generally
encouraged the authorities to explore options to build reserves, while taking into account related
costs. Directors noted the opportunities provided by robust growth in the rest of the continent and
invited careful analysis of South Africa’s spillovers to the region and potential spillbacks.
Directors noted the findings that the financial sector remains sound but is subject to
vulnerabilities. To strengthen the sector’s resilience, they encouraged timely implementation of
the FSAP recommendations, in particular enhancing scrutiny of asset quality and liquidity risks,
including through enhanced stress tests. Introducing deposit insurance and strengthening
regulation of collective investment schemes could reduce liquidity risks and boost market
discipline. Directors concurred that South Africa’s deep and highly interconnected financial
system requires group-wide supervision and better coordination among regulators. Directors
noted that more competition could improve financial access and lower intermediation costs.

Statement by Ms. Kapwepwe and Mr. Todani on South Africa
December 3, 2014
In its past twenty years of democracy, South Africa has made remarkable progress in
improving the welfare of its citizens. Access to education, health care and other services,
has increased together with significant extension of income support to the most
vulnerable. Social assistance now reaches 30 per cent of the population, while economic
participation has increased.
Notwithstanding this progress, unemployment, poverty and inequality remain high. Real
GDP growth is projected to be lower this year than previously anticipated and only a
modest recovery is expected in the medium term, with the risks tilted on the downside.
As a result of slow growth, tax revenue is below budget projection and the budget deficit
and government debt are rapidly rising. This has created a challenging macroeconomic
policy environment. My South African authorities are aware of these challenges and are
taking appropriate policy actions, including appropriate structural reforms, to steer the
economy back to a robust recovery.
Fiscal Policy
The South African authorities remain firmly committed to fiscal sustainability and are
taking the necessary measures to achieve this objective while protecting core social and
economic programs. In response to worsening budget deficit and debt outlook, the 2014
Medium Term Budget Policy Statement (MTBPS), although presented under fairly
difficult macro-economic circumstances, proposes a comprehensive fiscal consolidation
package to narrow the budget deficit, stabilize debt and begin to rebuild fiscal space. The
package primarily reduces the expenditure ceiling and raises tax revenue over the next
two years.
Specifically, some of the proposals include; lowering the 2014 Budget expenditure
ceiling by R25 billion over the next two years; implementing measures to generate
additional revenue of at least R27 billion over the next two years; freezing government
personnel headcounts; and adopting a deficit-neutral approach to financing state-owned
enterprises (SOEs). These measures will reduce the budget deficit and stabilize debt
thereby creating the much needed fiscal space and enhance the sustainability of public
finances.
My authorities are under no illusion that this is going to be an easy fiscal consolidation
path. Reduction in expenditure ceiling and increases in taxes in an environment where
there are so many pressing needs is going to be politically and socially challenging. Thus,
in considering these proposals, my authorities will ensure that restraining expenditure
growth will not compromise front-line services. Key social programs will be protected in
order to render the measures socially acceptable. While expenditure ceilings are being
lowered, the budget will continue to grow in real terms and in line with the medium-term
strategic framework (MTSF), which gives expression to the National Development Plan
(NDP).

2
Additional reforms are being undertaken to improve the efficiency of spending, including
enhancing the planning capacity of the public sector - particularly at local government
level, restructuring departments and agencies in order to eliminate inefficient resource
allocation and overlapping mandates. Most importantly, my authorities are implementing
measures to reinforce overall cost-containment. In this regard, financial accounting and
control systems are being strengthened, resulting in improved reporting of unauthorized,
irregular or wasteful expenditure.
Monetary Policy
Notwithstanding a 25 basis points increase in the South African Reserve Bank (SARB)
monetary policy rate – the repurchase rate, on July 17, 2014, monetary policy remains
relatively accommodative. The marked decline in international oil prices has had a
significant and favorable impact on the medium term outlook for inflation in South
Africa. As a consequence, inflation is now expected to slow further in 2015. At the same
time, the projected slowdown in economic growth should ensure little or no excess
demand pressures on the inflation outlook. These developments would imply that the
accommodative stance of monetary policy may be sustained for longer.
The SARB is aware of the upward risks to inflation outlook. Despite its recent relative
stability, the exchange rate remains vulnerable to changing perceptions of the timing of
global monetary policy adjustments, and the slow pace of contraction in the current
account deficit and this poses an upward risk to inflation outlook. A further upside risk to
the inflation outlook comes from a possible increase in wage settlement rates in excess of
inflation and productivity growth in the coming year. In this regard, the monetary
authorities will remain vigilant and will continue to monitor developments closely. The
timing of future interest-rate increases will be dependent on a range of factors, including
the evolution of inflation expectations, the speed of normalization of monetary policy in
the United States, and the state of the domestic economy.
My authorities note staff’s advice that the central bank could consider enhancing its
communications by “publishing inflation projections conditional on explicit interest rate
and exchange rate assumptions, as some other inflation targeting central banks do”. Since
the adoption of the inflation targeting regime, the SARB has made several steps towards
building a transparent monetary policy regime and they pay particular attention to the
day-to-day communication with the financial markets and the public at large. However,
my authorities are aware that determining the optimal level of communication is a
complex task. They are of the view that staff advice could lead to reduced operational
flexibility. However, the authorities remains committed and will continue to explores
ways to enhance their communication and transparency practices.

3
Financial Stability
The South African financial sector remains sound. However, as noted in the Financial
System Stability Assessment (FSSA), the operating environment for the South African
financial sector is rather challenging and subject to vulnerabilities. My authorities are
aware of these vulnerabilities, but the most important issue, in their view, is not
vulnerabilities per se but the resilience of the sector should these vulnerabilities
materialize. In this regard, the swift nature in which the recent event involving African
Bank (a boutique lender catering mainly to low-income households, which was placed
under curatorship after record losses from unsecured lending) was resolved without any
contagion effects, demonstrate the robust resilience of the South African financial sector.
Notwithstanding the soundness of the financial sector there is no room for complacency.
My authorities are continuing work to strengthen the financial sector in line with a series
of reforms announced in the 2011 paper - A safer financial sector to serve South Africa
better and they are committed to implement, to the extent possible, the 2014 FSSA
recommendations. This year, draft regulations for over-the-counter derivatives, credit
agreements, hedge funds and insurance were released. Substantial progress has been
made with retirement reforms. In addition, the second draft legislation to implement a
“twin-peaks” model of financial regulation has been completed and will soon be tabled in
Parliament. A number of FSSA recommendations have already been taken into
consideration in drafting this legislation.
The South African authorities continue to believe in the importance of exchange rate
flexibility as a key adjustment mechanism to external shocks. In their view, this exchange
rate regime has served South Africa well. Even at the height of the global financial crisis,
unlike some emerging market economies, South Africa did not experience liquidity
shortages as the country allowed the exchange rate to adjust to the availability of reserve
currency liquidity. With regard to the accumulation of reserves, my authorities can only
repeat what they said before, in that they agree with the desirability of higher reserves for
precautionary purposes. However, this needs to be balanced against the cost of reserves
build-up and management. They will continue to explore options to accumulate more
reserves and are willing to consider any policy advice in this regard, provided that the
potential benefits and costs are robustly established.
Structural Reforms
The MTBPS acknowledge that the current economic slowdown in South Africa has
underscored the structural constraints in the economy. My authorities recognize that a
number of factors that were perceived as temporary have now become embedded into
expectations. These factors include tightness in electricity supply, labor tensions, skills
shortages and transport constraints. The authorities realize that although important
structural changes are occurring in major economic sectors, these need to be accelerated.
Achieving faster growth and job creation will require growing private-sector investment,
as well as structural reforms that enhance the labor-intensity of growth.

4
As detailed in the MTBPS, South Africa’s longer-term economic prospects are tied to
successful implementation of the reforms described in the MTSF and the NDP.
Underpinning these reform initiatives is the recognition that the state must urgently step
up the provision of critical services and infrastructure, and improve its capacity to plan,
manage and maintain this infrastructure. These initiatives include large public-sector
infrastructure investments in energy, transport and communication sectors. They also
include expanded partnerships to encourage private-sector investment; special economic
zones to boost exports; programs to encourage more dynamic, integrated cities; and other
initiatives to improve the quality of education and skills development.
Finally, labor market reforms are continuing. In this regard, critical interventions over the
medium term include, improving dispute-settlement mechanisms in labor relations and
enabling immigration reform to encourage people with skills to work in South Africa.
