ROMANIA
Staff Report for the 2007 Article IV Consultation
Prepared by the Staff Representatives for the 2007 Consultation with Romania
Approved by Juha Kähkönen and Martin Fetherston
May 2, 2007
Executive Summary
Background: Growth is strong, while inflation and unemployment are falling.
However, strong credit growth, a widening current-account deficit and attendant
increase in vulnerabilities raise concerns. During 2006, the National Bank of Romania
(NBR) focused on improving the credibility of the inflation-targeting framework, but
upward exchange rate pressure has prompted it to reduce interest rates. On current
policies, the end-2007 inflation target will likely be missed, unless sizeable
appreciation occurs, and the current account deficit will widen further. Short-term risks
are manageable but, in the absence of a change in macroeconomic policies, an abrupt
adjustment may become necessary.
Staff views: The current environment calls for policies to minimize external and
financial-sector vulnerabilities, retain positive foreign-investor sentiment, and
maximize benefits from EU accession. To achieve macroeconomic stability and relieve
some pressure off monetary policy, staff advocated limiting the budget deficit to below
one percent of GDP in 2007 and tightening public-sector wage policy. On interest
rates, although the recent unification of the policy and the effective rates is welcome,
the NBR’s aggressive series of cuts is premature.
The authorities’ views: The authorities broadly shared the staff’s assessment and
agreed that the widening current account deficit and its attendant vulnerabilities are
cause for concern. However, because of substantial infrastructure and social needs, low
public debt, and fragile political situation, they found it difficult to take measures to
correct the loose fiscal and wage policy stance. They noted that the budget deficit
would not exceed their 2.8 percent of GDP target this year. The NBR acknowledged
the upside risks in the inflation outlook and risks of larger external imbalances, and
agreed with the need for tighter fiscal and wage policy and is prepared to raise interest
rates if need be.

I. INTRODUCTION
1.
The discussions were held at a historic moment. EU accession on January 1, 2007
follows a period of substantial achievements. After the 1999 currency crisis, macroeconomic
imbalances narrowed through: fiscal adjustment and prudent monetary policy; measures to
improve the SOEs’ financial
performance; and privatization.
Output growth accelerated
compared to the early years of
transition, narrowing the income
gap with the EU (Figure 1). The
NBR achieved substantial
disinflation, while macroeconomic
stabilization and EU accession
prospects helped boost investment,
productivity, and potential output.
Overall, policy objectives and
actions have been broadly in line
with Fund recommendations, although recent decisions have exacerbated excess demand
(Box 1). Investor confidence in Romania’s prospects has been high, but ongoing political
tensions may eventually impact investor sentiment.

Widening imbalances, however, call for a policy response. Although EU
convergence requires increased investment and foreign savings, the ongoing widening of the
external imbalance is disconcerting. Moreover, a procyclical fiscal loosening exacerbates
excess demand and heightens vulnerabilities. Rapid credit expansion is problematic.
Accordingly, discussions focused on policies to minimize external and financial-sector
vulnerabilities and maximize the benefits from EU accession.
II. RECENT DEVELOPMENTS
3.
Macroeconomic developments have been positive but there are areas of concern
(Figure 2). Specifically:
•

Economic growth was well above potential in 2006 (Table 1).1 In addition to a
recovery in agriculture, industrial output picked up substantially given strong gains in
productivity. Domestic demand has grown even more strongly, owing to solid
investment growth and a sharp increase in private consumption.

As outlined in IMF Country Report No. 06/168, staff estimated sustainable annual economic growth of 56 percent.

Box 1. Fund Policy Recommendations and Implementation
The authorities have broadly followed the Fund’s policy advice, although recent
policies diverge from recommendations.
Fiscal policy: While policy remained tight until November 2006, a substantial
loosening took place in December; and the 2007 budget is procyclical.
Wage policy: Substantial increases in government wages during 2004-07 have not
been in line with the Fund’s long-standing recommendation for prudence, and have
exacerbated demand pressures.
Monetary policy: Over the past two years, policy has been in line with Fund advice,
and has been successful in lowering inflation.
Structural policies: Significant progress has been made on privatization. However,
domestic gas prices are below international prices and the implementation of judicial
reform agenda is pending.

•

The inflation performance has been impressive. In addition to prudent monetary
and fiscal policies (through November 2006), disinflation benefited from the
postponement of administered-price increases, favorable agricultural prices, and
currency appreciation. Although CPI inflation has continued to fall recently—
3.7 percent y-o-y at end-March—core inflation has remained relatively flat at
4½ percent.

•

Strong credit growth has been associated with expanding domestic demand.
From a low base, real domestic credit grew by 66 percent in 2006—reflecting both
strong leu- and foreign-currency denominated credit (Figure 3).

•

Credit expansion has paralleled a widening current account deficit, but the
overall balance-of-payments remains strong (Table 2). Export performance has

remained robust, driven by strong manufacturing exports and confirming the shift
toward higher value-added goods. Moreover, the EU accession-related easing of trade
barriers and financial support have already accelerated structural change and will
boost trade. FDI covered 90 percent of the current account deficit, external debt
remains low, and reserve cover is comfortable.
•

Despite an increasing current account deficit, staff’s analysis indicates that
Romania’s exchange rate remains competitive. The gains in competitiveness
achieved by the 1999 correction in the exchange rate were preserved until end-2004
in an environment of low capital inflows. Following the adoption of greater
exchange-rate flexibility and capital-account liberalization, the leu appreciated
significantly in 2005. This, together with strong wage growth, resulted in a sharp real
appreciation (Figure 4). In contrast, with slowing nominal appreciation and easing
unit labor costs, the real exchange rate appreciated moderately in 2006. Further trend

real appreciation is to be expected, as price levels in Romania are still only half the
euro-zone average, and ultimately, the price gap (in euro) will narrow in tandem with
income convergence. However, staff’s analysis suggests that there still exists margin
for further appreciation, albeit at a measured pace, without unduly impacting the
external balance (Box 2). This assessment is supported by rising profitability in
manufacturing driven by strong productivity gains, good export performance, and
substantial foreign investment.
4.
Fiscal policy supported stabilization for most of last year, but there has been a
significant procyclical loosening recently (Figure 5). Strong revenue collections and
underutilization of the capital budget resulted in a fiscal surplus for most of 2006. However,
a spending surge in December led to an annual deficit of 1.7 percent of GDP (Table 3).
Indeed, more than 40 percent of the capital budget was spent in December 2006 alone. For
the year, real government expenditure rose by 20 percent. The government revised the budget
four times, increasing the deficit ceiling from 0.5 percent of GDP to 2.5 percent.
5.
Procyclical public-sector wage policies exacerbated domestic-demand pressures.
Such policies—influenced by trade unions and the fragile political environment—led to a
substantial real increase in government wages, outpacing those of the private sector
(Figure 6). The original wage allocation proved insufficient given average increases of 915 percent. Although the authorities had committed to freeze vacant positions (except EUaccession-related hiring) to offset wage overruns, government employment increased by
3⅓ percent. Moreover, on account of retroactive wages for teachers and judges due to legal
settlement, and payment of bonuses, the wage bill increased by 36 percent. On a positive
note, the government exercised prudence in the minimum wage (6½ percent) and controlled
SOEs’ wage bill.
6.
Following an inauspicious start, the NBR improved the credibility of its inflation
targeting (IT) regime. The NBR introduced IT in August 2005, but the announcement of the
new framework coincided with an immediate test of the central bank’s resolve—in the face
of a surge in capital inflows, the NBR intervened heavily in the foreign exchange market and
reduced interest rates sharply, rather than allowing further appreciation. Since then, however,
the NBR has stopped intervening and has tightened monetary conditions. In 2006, it raised
the reference policy interest rate, as well as the effective rate, to a unified level of
8.75 percent.

Equilibrium-based indicators of Romania’s real exchange rate (RER) suggest that there is still
room for further appreciation, albeit at a measured pace. Romania has long benefited from low
wages vis-à-vis other
economies. Using

III. POLICY DISCUSSIONS
9.
Discussions centered on policies for reducing vulnerabilities and laying the
foundations for sustainable growth:
¾ How to design policies to address the widening external imbalance, while supporting the
growth and inflation objectives?
¾ Strong and sustainable real convergence requires an expanding financial sector and
sizeable capital inflows. How to minimize risks in a setting where credit, asset prices, and
the real exchange rate may all be undergoing strong equilibrium adjustment?
¾ How to improve the business climate, and increase labor participation and employment to
accelerate the pace of convergence?
A. Outlook, Vulnerabilities, and Risks
10.
There was broad recognition that meeting the authorities’ macroeconomic
objectives, on current policies, will be challenging. With the economy overheating, the
envisaged fiscal and incomes policy will add to demand, and contribute to a further widening
of the current account deficit and inflationary pressures. There was agreement that such an
outcome, combined

combined with a
depreciation would weaken the debt-service capacity of households and enterprises, putting
the banking system under strain (Box 3). Less dramatically, delayed adjustment over the near
term increases the risk of a hard landing in the future, and could complicate meeting the
Maastricht criteria.

18
Box 3. The Impact of a Sudden Stop
Although large current account deficits are a natural response to convergence, the size of the
deficit and the emphasis on consumption have raised concerns about the economy’s
vulnerability to a change in foreign-investor sentiment. A sudden drop in external demand for
Romanian assets would lead to a drop in funding, forcing a swift and painful adjustment. Staff
has developed a model that seeks to estimate the likelihood and impact of a stop in capital
flows.
Controlling for the type of capital inflow, the model focuses on: i) external vulnerability,
which captures the real exchange rate adjustment that would be necessary if the deficit were
suddenly brought down to zero; and ii) internal vulnerability, which captures the extent of
currency-related balance-sheet mismatches.
The results suggest that despite a growing
external imbalance, the risks of a stop have
been kept in check by Romania’s strong FDI
financing. However, even FDI flows can
slow sharply. Then, the immediate impact on
GDP growth would be significant, perhaps as
high as 7-8 percentage points, with some
recovery in the first year after the crisis.

11.
Staff thus called for prudent policies that will sustain growth and contain
vulnerabilities. In a setting of strong private-sector expansion and capital inflows, fiscal
policy is key for assuring macroeconomic stability. Accordingly, staff advocated tightening
fiscal and incomes policies to relieve some of the burden on monetary policy. With
appropriate policies, staff expects strong growth, a continuation of disinflation and
containment of the current account deficit. An updated debt sustainability analysis points to a
sustainable current account deficit of 8 percent of GDP, which would stabilize the external
debt-to-GDP ratio at 30 percent (Table 11 and Appendix IV). The scenario assumes
continued FDI inflows, with a shift away from privatization-related flows, followed by a
gradual slowdown in the outer years (Table 7).

19
B. Fiscal and Incomes Policies
12.
Staff found the authorities’ fiscal plans inconsistent with maintaining
macroeconomic stability. The budget targets a deficit of 2.8 percent of GDP, which
represents a significant expansion in the cyclically-adjusted fiscal deficit. Also, in staff’s
view, budget revenue projections are optimistic. This view is confirmed by revenue
performance this year. On expenditure, the wage allocation does not incorporate all salary
increases approved by parliament. Staff projects that, on current policies, the underlying
deficit is 3½ percent of GDP. The recognition of additional Property-Fund claims and
drawings on the National Development Fund would add yet further to the cash deficit.

1/ On the basis of the approved budget and in line with staff's baseline scenario (adjusted for staff's projections
for revenues and expenditures).
2/ On the basis of staff's proposed scenario.
3/ Capital expenditure under the two scenarios for 2007 is based on more realistic assumptions about the implementation
capacity , also given the sharp increase in capital expenditure in December 2006.

13.
The authorities acknowledged the need for fiscal restraint, but also pointed to
pressing needs. Staff advocated a withdrawal of fiscal stimulus and a smooth path for
medium-term consolidation. Recognizing the need for tax-legislation stability, the scope for
revenue measures this year is limited, therefore the majority of the adjustment would fall on
expenditure—considered feasible given last December’s expenditure splurge. Staff noted
that, in the face of significant capital inflows, a widening external imbalance, and an
appreciating currency, greater fiscal adjustment would be desirable. However, provided
disinflation is proceeding, the current account deficit is contained, and debt levels remain
low, staff considered that a fiscal adjustment of ¾ percent of GDP relative to the 2006
outturn (1.9 percent relative to the government target), accompanied by tighter incomes
policy would be an appropriate policy package for this year. The proposed adjustment would
represent a strong counter-cyclical response to overheating, and would also take some
pressure off monetary policy (Figure 5). Although the authorities considered this assessment
balanced, they found the proposed adjustment infeasible, given Romania’s infrastructure and

20
social needs, the political environment, and the favorable debt position. They felt confident
that the 2.8 percent deficit ceiling would not be exceeded.
14.
There was agreement on the need to permanently strengthen revenue and
advance expenditure reforms. Romania’s revenue ratio is considerably below all EU
countries, and pressing spending needs argue for more resources. Staff urged the government
to resist calls for tax cuts except for the relatively-high social contributions tax and
distortionary exemptions (e.g., a reduced VAT rate, exemption of reinvested profits, and a
differentiated car-registration tax). The authorities noted that, although they did not plan any
tax changes, tax-administration improvements should strengthen revenues. On expenditure,
they agreed with the need to proceed with much-needed reforms (e.g., civil service,
education, health, and pensions).
15.
The authorities have vowed to strengthen revenue administration, in line with
IMF staff and World Bank recommendations. Their strategy aims at modernizing
administration, broadening the tax base, and addressing shortcomings in the organizational
structure and legal mandate of the Agency for Fiscal Administration.
16.
The authorities agreed that a strict public-sector wage policy is needed for
disinflation, but pointed to pressure for rapid convergence with average EU wages. The
government has approved significant wage increases for 2007 (up to 20 percent on average)
in three rounds; the minimum wage has been raised by 18 percent; and the monitoring of
SOEs’ wage bill has eased. The mission noted the risks associated with this wage policy and
emphasized its incompatibility with the inflation objective (unless administered-price
increases are delayed, which would be undesirable). To contain the wage bill, staff suggested
reducing the envisaged increases, controlling bonuses, and closely monitoring additional
hirings. A tightening of public-sector wages would give a signal for prudent private-sector
settlements, as staff’s analysis (outlined in a Selected Issues Paper) has found significant
demonstration effects. To anchor inflationary expectations in the low digits, public-sector
wages should increase moderately, once a year, and be incorporated in the budget. The
authorities agreed with the risks of a loose wage policy, but noted the difficulty in attracting
high-skilled staff, and pointed to the trade unions and the fragile political environment.
17.
There was agreement that improved transparency, enhanced monitoring, and a
credible medium-term fiscal framework would strengthen the institutional setting of
fiscal policy. Some features of the present setting undermine its credibility: there are multiple
budget revisions; medium-term policies and objectives are not elaborated; and expenditures
increase sharply at year-end. Staff suggested establishing mechanisms to ensure the efficient
allocation of resources and absorption of EU inflows, and noted the importance of
conducting a ROSC update. Multiple budget revisions should be avoided, while improved
public-spending management needs to ensure a uniform spending pattern over the year. The
authorities agreed on the need to strengthen the budgetary process by developing a credible
medium-term framework, but were hesitant in adopting medium-term expenditure ceilings.

The NBR faces a challenging environment. Its policy guidelines call for entry into
ERM-II by 2010-12, and euro adoption by 2012–14. In staff’s view, this timetable is feasible
and appropriate. However, it

difficult dilemma—meeting its
inflation goals through higher interest rates may put further upward pressure on the currency.
Staff stressed, however, that in the long run the only sustainable solution is to lower nominal
interest rates by firmly anchoring inflationary expectations. This requires a credible inflationtargeting framework.
19.
Staff urged the NBR to focus on inflation and reunify the policy and effective
interest rates as soon as possible. At the time of the mission, the effective rate was about

inflation targets for 2007 and 2008 (4.0 and
3.8 percent, respectively). In staff’s view, these targets are feasible and reflect a realistic
balance between rapid disinflation, and the ongoing pace of structural change. There are

significant risks to the inflation outlook, however, and if the authorities do not tighten fiscal
and incomes policies, the NBR may have to increase interest rates further.
20.
The NBR generally agreed with the staff assessment, though it suggested that,
taking into account previous appreciation and higher reserve requirements, monetary
conditions were tighter than allowed for by staff. The NBR further agreed that Romania
still enjoyed a margin of competitiveness. However, it did not agree that concern about the
pace of appreciation was necessarily inconsistent with the bank’s inflation-targeting
commitment. Given Romania’s real convergence, the currency would likely continue on a
medium-term upward path. But excessive short-term appreciation could leave the economy
vulnerable to a sudden reversal, which would then adversely impact the pace of disinflation
and the health of the financial sector.
21.
Following the mission, the NBR reduced the official policy rate further to
7½ percent. Market participants interpreted the move as highlighting the NBR’s focus on
recent appreciation, rather than future inflation. In staff’s view, such an aggressive loosening
of monetary policy is premature. An effective nominal rate of 7½ percent is, in real terms,
only marginally above the estimated neutral rate, and will do little to close the current output
gap. Under the staff’s baseline scenario, if rates are maintained at this level, and fiscal and
incomes policies proceed as planned, the resulting rise in excess demand will likely push
inflation above the upper band of the NBR target range, and will lead to a further widening of
the current account deficit.
22.
Both sides expressed concern about the ongoing pace of credit growth.
Acknowledging that real convergence will naturally require an expanding financial sector,
staff also stressed that current credit demand also partly reflects the continuing strength of
excess demand. In any event, overly-rapid credit growth can magnify existing distortions and
raise medium-term vulnerabilities, so the authorities were urged to maintain vigilance. There
was agreement that administrative measures are often less and less effective over time, and
are generally ill-suited to addressing a macroeconomic stabilization problem—as a first-best
response to excess demand, the focus should be on higher interest rates. On reserve
requirements, although levels in Romania are significantly higher than those in the EU, staff
agreed that efforts to lower them should proceed cautiously. High reserve requirements do
impose an added cost on domestic banks, and encourage disintermediation, but the
authorities should take care that lowered reserves do not add to macroeconomic imbalances.
D. Financial Sector Issues
23.
Staff observed that, although the banking sector seems well-positioned to absorb
adverse shocks, the authorities should nonetheless be alert to medium-term
vulnerabilities. Competitive pressures are increasing and spreads are falling, but the banking
system remains liquid, well capitalized and profitable. Rates of return on equity and capitaladequacy ratios are high, while non-performing loan (NPL) ratios remain at moderate levels.

23
Moreover, the banking system is now almost 90 percent foreign owned. Foreign banks have
been aggressive lenders, but also have relatively sophisticated risk-management policies, and
can most likely rely on external support in the event of local liquidity problems or other
adverse shocks.
24.
The authorities continue to make progress in strengthening their capacity for
assessing financial-sector stability. The NBR published its first Financial Stability Report
in May 2006, and will release a second report by mid-2007. NBR stress tests suggest that the
banking system remains resilient to the direct impact of interest-rate and exchange-rate
movements, as well as a growth slowdown. However, in the context of rapid credit growth,
indirect exposures through loan portfolios are much more difficult to assess. In this context,
although NBR balance-sheet analysis indicates that the debt-service capacity of the corporate
sector is healthy and rising, unhedged household borrowing is a concern, and the
consequences of a less benign economy are difficult to predict. Therefore, staff urged the
authorities to encourage high capital ratios and conservative provisioning practices. Given
the dominant role of foreign-owned banks, the mission discussed NBR cooperation with
regulatory and supervisory authorities in other countries. Memoranda of Understanding have
been signed for all banks with a presence in Romania, and NBR staff are already
participating in drills with other authorities to ensure a rapid and coordinated response to
potential cross-border banking problems. The mission welcomed the authorities’ desire to
have an FSAP update this year.
E. Structural Policies
25.
There was agreement that structural reforms were crucial for real convergence.
The authorities acknowledged the need to continue with domestic gas price adjustments in
line with opportunity cost developments and with their commitment to achieve import parity,
but were hesitant to announce a specific schedule for such increases. Increasing labor-market
participation and employment rates, will require an ambitious strategy encompassing

CEC privatization had been postponed, and noted the need to proceed with the privatization
of energy-sector companies. Staff also noted the importance of developing the capital market.
The authorities acknowledged the need to tackle corruption and noted their determination to
forcefully implement their judicial reform agenda.
IV. STAFF APPRAISAL
26.
Romania’s prospects remain bright and the current juncture provides an
excellent reform opportunity. EU accession followed a period of important
accomplishments. However, although growth is strong and convergence has been proceeding
at a rapid pace, the outlook is clouded by widening imbalances. Domestic demand has been
facilitated by rapid credit growth and procyclical fiscal and incomes policies. The confluence
of positive factors that led to last year’s impressive performance cannot be counted on to
continue. The current juncture thus presents an opportunity to implement a reform program
that will enhance Romania’s growth potential and narrow the income gap with the EU.
27.
A tightening of policies is necessary to reduce vulnerabilities, lay down
sustainable growth foundations, and lock in gains from EU membership. Lasting
increases in human and physical capital will only be possible with increased domestic
savings and investment. The need to reduce external imbalances and vulnerabilities places a
higher premium on consistent fiscal, incomes, and monetary policies, which serve as
insurance against sudden shifts in market sentiment. A postponed response would only
increase the need for more abrupt policy action later. The authorities’ intention to adopt the
euro provides an added incentive.
28.
Fiscal restraint is needed to ensure macroeconomic stability. To this end, the
authorities should aim at withdrawing fiscal stimulus this year, targeting a budget deficit of
below 1 percent of GDP. Since the scope for revenue measures is limited, the majority of the
adjustment must fall on expenditure. Moreover, staff cautions the authorities on the
utilization of resources from the National Development Fund and additional Property Fund
claims, both of which would result in a larger deficit, further compromising their
macroeconomic objectives. Given Romania’s pressing expenditure needs and low revenue
ratio, there is a case for permanently strengthening revenue. In addition to broadening the tax
base and modernizing tax administration, the government needs to resist calls for tax
reduction (except social contributions) and distortionary exemptions.
29.
A strict public-sector wage policy is needed for successful disinflation and
macroeconomic stability. The approved wage increases in the public sector are
incompatible with the inflation objective. Wage policy needs to be calibrated to the needs of
a low inflation economy, featuring wage increases only once a year—which are moderate,
transparent, and fully incorporated in the budget.

26
30.
Improved fiscal transparency, enhanced monitoring, and a credible mediumterm framework are important elements of a strong institutional setting. The experience
of other accession countries suggests the importance of improving the efficiency of absorbing
EU funds. Multiple revisions of the budget should be avoided, while expenditure
management needs to be improved to ensure a uniform spending pattern over the year. To
strengthen the budgetary process, a credible medium-term framework is needed.
31.
The central bank operates in a difficult policy environment. Given that the
immediate challenge is to firmly anchor inflationary expectations, the current series of
aggressive interest-rate cuts appears premature. Although headline inflation has fallen
recently, and an appreciating currency promises further relief over the short term, excess
demand is still strong, and inflationary pressures are likely to reemerge toward the end of the
year, especially in the wake of fiscal loosening. Staff welcomes the recent reunification of the
policy and effective interest rates, which will help strengthen the signaling role of the policy
rate, but considers that the current level of 7½ percent will do little to curb excess demand.
The NBR therefore should stand ready to increase rates to ensure that the inflation targets
remain within reach. Similarly, although reserve requirements are notably higher than in
other EU countries, staff agrees that lowering the requirements should proceed cautiously.
32.
Financial-soundness indicators suggest that the banking system is well
positioned to absorb adverse shocks, but the authorities still need to maintain their
efforts to minimize vulnerabilities. In the face of increasing competition and falling
spreads, the banking sector remains liquid, well-capitalized, and profitable. Indicators and
stress tests suggest that Romania’s banks are still well-positioned to absorb the consequences
of adverse interest-rate or exchange-rate movements, or of slower economic growth.
However, the financial system is still in transition, and overly-rapid credit growth can
magnify existing distortions and raise medium-term vulnerabilities. This places an added
premium on effective supervision and regulation. Staff commends the NBR’s continued
progress in developing its capacity for assessing overall stability, and welcomes the
authorities’ desire to have an FSAP update this year.
33.
Structural reforms need to be accelerated to support real convergence. The
authorities are encouraged to accelerate privatization in the energy sector; announce a
schedule for increased domestic producer gas prices in line with opportunity costs; put
together a strategy to increase labor-market participation and employment rates; strengthen
their efforts for the introduction of the second pension pillar; and forcefully implement their
judicial reform agenda.
34.
It is proposed that the next Article IV consultation be held on the standard 12-month
cycle.

1/ NPL figures reflect unadjusted exposure to non-performing loans classified as: "loss," "doubtful," and
"substandard" according to loans-classification regulations. The steady level of NPLs in the face of
growing credit partly reflects Romania's relatively conservative classification and provisioning
requirements. Provisioning requirements, net of collateral, are 100% for loss, 50% for doubtful.
2/ Credit Risk Ratio reflects unadjusted exposure to non-performing loans classified as "loss" and
"doubtful" (as percent of gross loans) according to loans-classification regulations.
3/ Past-due and doubtful loans are net of collateral, according to banks' accounting balance sheets.
The difference between this NPL ratio and the two ratios (1/ and 2/) results from the classification
criteria enforced by Romania's loans classification and provisioning regulations (e.g. debtors' financial
performance, currency denomination of income, principle of contamination, new borrower, etc).

2/ Derived as [(r - p(1+g) - g + ae(1+r)]/(1+g+p+gp)) times previous period debt ratio, with r = interest rate; p = growth rate of GDP deflator; g = real GDP growth rate; a = share of foreign-currency
denominated debt; and e = nominal exchange rate depreciation (measured by increase in local currency value of U.S. dollar).
3/ The real interest rate contribution is derived from the denominator in footnote 2/ as r - π (1+g) and the real growth contribution as -g.
4/ The exchange rate contribution is derived from the numerator in footnote 2/ as ae(1+r).
5/ For projections, this line includes exchange rate changes.
6/ Defined as public sector deficit, plus amortization of medium and long-term public sector debt, plus short-term debt at end of previous period.
7/ The key variables include real GDP growth; real interest rate; and primary balance in percent of GDP.
8/ Derived as nominal interest expenditure divided by previous period debt stock.

Exchange Rate Arrangements

Romania has maintained a de jure inflation-targeting regime since August 2005, but has also
characterized its exchange-rate approach as a managed float. In this context, the authorities

have intervened, often heavily, in response to perceived excessive exchange rate movements,
but have no formal predetermined path. The official reference rate published by the NBR is
an average of rates reported for interbank and client transactions. Romania has accepted the
obligations of Article VIII, Sections 2, 3, and 4, with effect from March 25, 1998. Romania’s
exchange system is free of restrictions on the making of payments and transfers for current
international transactions.
X.

Article IV Consultation

Romania is on the 12-month consultation cycle subject to the provisions of the decision on
consultation cycles approved by the Board on July 15, 2002. The last consultation was
concluded on April 26, 2006.
XI.

Technical Assistance

The transition in Romania has been supported by substantial technical assistance from
multilateral agencies and bilateral donors. The Fund has provided support in a number of
areas with more than 40 technical assistance missions since 1990, although the authorities
have had a mixed record with regard to implementation. Expert Fund assistance has focused
on a number of key areas, including: fiscal reforms; modernization of the central bank and
the banking system; creating a market-oriented legal structure; training; and improving the
collection and reporting of statistics. The implementation of a comprehensive tax
administration reform designed in line with the recommendations of several technical
assistance missions of the Fund’s Fiscal Affairs Department started in January 2003. A report
on the observance of standards and codes (ROSC) on fiscal transparency was completed on
November 6, 2002 (IMF Country Report No. 02/254). Furthermore, in 2003 an FSAP was
completed, while technical assistance by the Fund’s Monetary and Capital Markets
Department on inflation targeting is ongoing.
XII.

Safeguards Assessment

Under the Fund's safeguards assessment policy, the National Bank of Romania (NBR) is
subject to full safeguards assessment with respect to the Stand-By Arrangement approved on
July 7, 2004. The assessment was completed on June 17, 2004 and concluded that safeguards
in place at the NBR appear generally adequate. However, certain weaknesses were identified
in the internal audit and controls system, and the safeguards assessment recommended
measures to address them.
XIII. Anti-Money Laundering and Combating the Financing of Terrorism framework
The legislative framework for anti-money laundering and combating the financing of
terrorism (AML/CFT) has been updated recently to bring Romania in line with international

42
standards, in the context of Romania's EU accession. The AML/CFT system continues,
however, to suffer from severe shortcomings, including in the supervisory area. While the
level of AML supervision is improving in the banking sector and the NBR appears to be
taking this issue seriously, it remains extremely weak for the financial sector at large. In
addition, there is very little, if any, oversight of the non-financial sector for AML/CFT
purposes and the authorities have started only recently to inspect casinos, a sector which
appears to be particularly vulnerable to money laundering risks. Finally, while AML
requirements have been extended to cover financing of terrorism recently, additional training
of reporting entities and competent authorities in this area remains necessary.
XIV. Resident Representative
The Fund has had a resident representative in Bucharest since 1991. Mr. Juan Jose
Fernandez-Ansola assumed the post of senior regional resident representative in
September 2006.

43
APPENDIX II. ROMANIA: RELATIONS WITH THE WORLD BANK
A. Partnership in Romania’s Development Strategy
1.
The Romanian authorities are pursuing a strategy designed to achieve
macroeconomic stability and establish sustainable economic growth and poverty reduction,
that will allow closer integration of their economy with the rest of the European Union. Key
elements of this strategy include tightening payments discipline throughout the economy,
especially in the energy sector, hardening budget constraints for state-owned enterprises,
actively pursuing enterprise and banking privatization and restructuring, and strengthening
the social safety net. Over the medium term, continuation of the current economic recovery
will depend critically on the maintenance of reform momentum and moving steadily ahead
with governance and private sector development reforms. Such reforms would stress
transparency and accountability in government, judicial reforms, improvements in the
business environment, and actions to strengthen the regulation and oversight of financial and
capital markets.
2.
In broad terms, the IMF has taken the lead in assisting Romania in achieving
macroeconomic stability. As such its program focus is on the fiscal framework, monetary
policy, and those elements of the structural reform program that have a direct bearing on the
macroeconomic situation. The main vehicles for its dialogue with the authorities have been
the Stand-By Arrangement (SBA) covering the period October 31, 2001 to October 15, 2003
and a precautionary SBA which ended in June 2006. The authorities have not sought a
further program with the IMF, but dialogue on key issues continues in the context of the
Article IV Reviews.
3.
The World Bank has taken the lead in policy dialogue on structural issues, including
poverty reduction measures, private sector development, institution building and governance.
It has a range of instruments through which it conducts dialogue, including adjustment
lending operations such as PSAL 1 and PSAL 2, a series of Programmatic Adjustment Loans,
the first of which went to the Bank Board in September 2004, several sector investment
operations, and economic work such as the Public Expenditure and Institutions Review, and
the Country Economic Memorandum focused on restructuring for EU integration. The
Bank’s analysis is shared with the IMF and is used as input to the fiscal framework,
including structural reform measures which have important fiscal implications, such as
energy sector reform and restructuring. There are further areas of formal joint responsibility
such as the Financial Sector Assessment Program (FSAP).
4.
Overall the IMF and World Bank staff maintain a close collaborative relationship in
supporting the Government’s reform program and are coordinating their policy advice to the
Romanian authorities.

44
B. IMF-World Bank Collaboration in Specific Areas
Areas in which the World Bank leads and there is no direct IMF involvement
5.
The policy areas in which the Bank leads and which are not directly incorporated into
the IMF program or country dialogue include strengthening the social safety net, revitalizing
the economy in rural areas, institution building and governance, and improving the business
environment. Bank policy dialogue for strengthening the social safety net includes poverty
monitoring, social assistance, pension reform, health sector reforms, and labor retraining and
redeployment. These have been supported by the Bank’s Social Sector Development Loan,
two Social Development Fund Loans, and two Mine Closure Loans. A Social Inclusion Loan,
aimed at improving the living conditions of economically disadvantaged groups, in particular
the Roma population, was approved by the Bank’s Board in June 2006. These loans are
further supported by analytical work such as the recently completed Pension Reform Study
and the ongoing poverty monitoring.
6.
The Bank has a range of programs to revitalize the economy in rural areas. These
include the Rural Finance Loan and a Rural Development Loan which support, respectively,
income generation activities and public infrastructure investments, and will be complemented
by a planned Farm Restructuring Loan to facilitate farmers’ access to EU grant funds by
supporting completion of rural land title registration and delivery of income and asset
management advisory services to farmers. In addition, the Bank is planning to finance an
Integrated Nutrient Pollution Control Loan, complemented by a Global Environment Facility
Grant, which will support the promotion of good agricultural practices and capacity-building
activities to access EU structural funds to meet the EU Nitrate Directive. The ongoing
Irrigation Rehabilitation loan supports infrastructure rehabilitation and institutional reform.
The MAKIS project supports the capacity of the agricultural sector to meet the health and
food safety requirements of the EU, and the modernization and reform of selected research
institutions. Supporting economic work includes a Regional Development Policy Note.
7.
The Bank has a strong institution building and governance program. This builds on
reforms in local public finance and taxation and decentralization. Policy dialogue has been
informed by the Public Expenditure and Institutions Review which included analysis and
recommendations addressing institutional constraints to absorption of EU grants, deepening
the Medium Term Expenditure Framework, and addressing sectoral expenditure priorities
with effective planning and sustainable financing. The policy dialogue has also been
supported by a Country Financial Accountability Assessment (CFAA). The Bank completed
a Diagnostic Survey of Corruption in Romania prior to the Government’s preparing of its
National Program for Prevention of Corruption. The first Programmatic Adjustment Loan to
Romania was approved by the World Bank Board in September 2004. It focused on
institutional and governance reforms in the public service and the judiciary as well as public
expenditure management as well as the remaining structural reform agenda. It was supported
by a $18.6 million Private and Public Sector Institution Building Loan which provides

45
technical assistance for these activities and others relating to privatization. Other institutionbuilding support includes financing of a cadastral and land titling project, a hazards
mitigation project cofinanced by a GEF grant which focuses on damage from earthquakes,
floods toxic wastes and other hazards in high risk areas, and a loan financing modernization
of the judiciary.
8.
Policy advice and support for reforms in the business environment have been offered
by the Bank in several areas. Through PSAL 1, PSAL 2, and PAL 1 the Bank has focused on
reducing barriers to entry for firms and joint ventures, implementing internationally
recognized accounting standards, and introducing improved bankruptcy and liquidation
procedures. All of these initiatives have been supported by technical assistance provided
under the PPIBL.
9.
The Bank is very active in the transport sector. It is financing a Transport
Restructuring Loan ($225 million) as well as a Transport Sector Support Loan
($180 million). And a new operation under preparation would finance water and wastewater
infrastructure investments at the municipal level, and building capacity for project
preparation needed to access and absorb EU grant funds..
Areas in which the World Bank leads and its analysis serves as input into the IMF
program
10.
The Bank has supported the GOR’s privatization program through the PAL program
which includes targets and timelines for privatization of commercial SOEs and financial
institutions. The program builds on the progress established under PSALs 1 and 2 which
identified pools of SOEs from which set minimum numbers of enterprises are selected for
case-by-case privatization and workout. Specific enterprises including Alro, Alprom, and
Petrom, were also identified. The PAL program includes further targets for privatization of
commercial enterprises and enterprises in the energy and banking sectors.
11.
The Bank has led the dialogue on restructuring, reform and eventual privatization of
enterprises in the electricity, district heating and gas industries and on the adoption of
regulatory legislation in preparation for privatization to strategic investors. As part of this
process the Bank is supporting, inter alia, energy tariff reforms and reforms in the electricity,
district heat and gas sectors. These objectives are woven into the policy conditions of the
PAL program, along with conditions related to the privatization of electricity distribution
enterprises. These conditions have been closely coordinated with the IMF since the SBAs
have also included provisions for structural reforms in the energy sector including tariff
setting, arrears clearance and collection rates. The Bank is leading the IFI dialogue with the
Government on such critical long-term issues as power generation sector restructuring and
the integration of the Romanian power sector with the South East European Regional
Electricity Market and with the EU’s electricity market, and provides assistance on the
associated regulatory and market operation issues. The Bank has also provided technical
assistance to the Ministry of Industry to establish a system of pricing and taxation of gas

46
consistent with attracting further investment into the industry. Policy dialogue in these and
other areas, notably including the district heating sector, will be further facilitated by ongoing
dialogue with the Government on the recently completed Energy and Infrastructure Strategy
paper and its operational recommendations.
12.
The Bank has taken the lead in dialogue and policy advice regarding regulation,
restructuring, privatization and liquidation of banks. Under PSAL 1 the Law on Bank
Privatization was modified and transparent privatization procedures established. Liquidity
and solvency requirements of the NBR were tightened and provisions introduced for
improved compliance with prudential regulations and external audits conducted according to
International Accounting Standards. Legal and institutional reforms were introduced for
orderly disposition of non-performing assets. These policy changes underpinned liquidation
of the most troubled bank (Bancorex ) while Bank Agricola was restructured and eventually
privatized as were two smaller state owned banks. This policy agenda has been continued
under the PAL program and included privatization of the largest state bank BCR. The Bank
is continuing the dialogue with the government on the need to move forward with further
improvements of the legal and regulatory framework for the securities and insurance sectors.
The PPIBL will provide funding for these activities.
Areas of shared responsibility
13.
While the Bank has taken the lead in privatization and in structural reforms in the
energy sector as described above, the IMF has a strong interest from a macroeconomic
perspective since privatization revenues have been primarily used to retire public debt, and
quasi-fiscal deficits of the SOEs present a threat to macroeconomic stability. Accordingly,
there is a high degree of consultation and coordination between the two institutions on these
matters. While the terms of the respective programs are mutually consistent and supportive,
the focus and motivation for the Bank’s program are on the efficiency of the resulting market
structures, improved enterprise operation, service delivery and financial performance, and the
transparency of the process and improvement in overall sector governance, and that of the
IMF is on immediate revenue generation and expenditure control, and containment of
ongoing fiscal burdens.
14.
The Bank and the IMF jointly conducted a Financial Sector Assessment Program
which was completed in June 2003.
Areas in which the IMF leads and its analysis serves as input into the World Bank
program
15.
The Fund leads the dialogue on fiscal matters. The IMF also leads the dialogue on
policies to contain certain expenditures in the public sector. These include policies regarding
wage-setting in both the public service and SOEs and the budgets of SOEs.

47
16.
In these areas the Bank takes into account the policy recommendations of the IMF
and ensures that its own policy advice is consistent.
Areas in which the IMF leads and there is no direct World Bank involvement
17.
The IMF is fully responsible for the dialogue on monetary policy, interest rates, the
exchange rate regime, the balance of payments and all the related statistical and measurement
issues.
C. World Bank Group Strategy and Lending Operations
18.
The current Country Partnership Strategy (CPS) for Romania was presented to the
World Bank’s Board on May 16, 2006. It was designed to facilitate Romania’s integration
with the EU building on three pillars: (a) accelerating structural and institutional reforms to
support sustainable growth; (b) addressing fiscal vulnerabilities and modernizing the public
sector; and (c) targeting poverty reduction and promoting social inclusion. A flexible lending
program of $450 million to $550 million per year was envisaged using a mix of investment
lending and programmatic Development Policy Loans. Base case lending includes
investment projects subject to pre-conditions of appropriate sector policy and an acceptable
medium term sector expenditure framework. High case lending would be a combination of
investment and development policy lending where the latter would require maintenance of an
appropriate macroeconomic framework as per Bank guidelines and periodic review in
consultation with the IMF.
19.
Since the beginning of the CPS period several investment loans have been made.
However, no further DPLs have been concluded and after PAL 1, the PAL program is being
dropped.
The World Bank has been active in Romania since 1991, and the portfolio is now the
20.
largest in the ECA Region in terms of number of projects and second largest in
commitments. The active IBRD and GEF portfolio as of January 1, 2007 consists of 23
projects with aggregate net commitments totaling $1.785 billion and a total undisbursed
balance of $1.27 billion. Sector composition in terms of net commitments is dominated by
environment and socially sustainable development (35 percent, 12 projects), and energy and
infrastructure (39 percent, 5 projects), followed by the social sectors (14 percent, four
projects).

21.
Implementation of projects in the Bank’s Romania portfolio has slowed in recent
years. In FY06 and FY07 Romania’s annual disbursement ratio fell below its 16 percent
historical average and from a peak of 27 percent in FY03. Today, 86 percent of the
portfolio’s net commitments have been approved in the last four FYs, and three-quarters of
them are less than three years old. Given that new loans typically do not start disbursing very
much during the first two years following loan approval, this accounts for about 80 percent of

48
the portfolio disbursement slowdown. The Bank the Ministry of Finance are working
together to address this issue.
22.
IFC has dedicated substantial resources to assist the development of capital markets
and infrastructure (utilities and telecommunication), and provide support for small and
medium enterprises (SMEs). To date, IFC has committed over US$772 million of its own
funds in 42 projects and has arranged over $241 million in syndications to support projects in
the financial markets, information technology, food and beverage, general manufacturing,
health care and infrastructure. As of January 2007, IFC portfolio in Romania stood at
$411 million. In addition to investments, IFC has undertaken a number of advisory
assignments aimed at supporting the privatization and restructuring of large state-owned
enterprises, public utilities and the health sector.
Questions may be referred to Ron Hood (473-0115) or Myla Williams (473-6997).

49
APPENDIX III. ROMANIA: STATISTICAL ISSUES
1.
Data collection and reporting are adequate for surveillance and program monitoring,
but the quality of the national accounts, price, fiscal, and balance of payments data needs
improvement. The authorities have made progress in improving economic and financial
statistics with technical assistance, including from the Fund, over the past several years.
Romania began participating in the GDDS in February 2001 and graduated to subscription to
the SDDS in May 2005.
Real Sector
2.
Quarterly and annual national accounts statistics are produced by the National
Institute for Statistics (INS) using the European System of Accounts 1995 (ESA95). Estimates
are methodologically sound and are reported to the Fund on a timely basis for publication in
the International Financial Statistics (IFS). However, quarterly and annual national accounts
are not harmonized on a regular basis and late revisions have sometimes been significant.
Provisional and semi-final versions are disseminated in the Statistical Yearbook and other
publications, and on the web (www.insse.ro).
3.
The Consumer Price Index (CPI) is subject to standard annual re-weighting, and it is
considered reliable. In January 2004, the INS changed the coverage of the PPI to include the
domestic and export sectors.
Public Finance
4.
Annual GFS data are reported on an accrual basis derived from cash data using
various methods: tax revenues are adjusted using the time-adjusted cash method; expense
data are adjusted using due-for-payments data; and, interest payments are calculated on an
accrual basis. Beginning in 2002, the Special Fund for Development of the Energy System,
Special Fund for Public Roads, Special Fund “Romanian Agriculture Development,” and
Special Fund “Romania” were included in the state budget, while the Special Fund for
Insured Protection was eliminated from general government accounts. The reported data
excluded data on the Agency for Recovery Bank Assets.1 EUR receives monthly budget data.
The authorities introduced a new budget classification for the 2006 budget and have also
produced the 2004-05 budget outturns on the basis of the new classification.

1

Formerly, the Agency for Bank Asset Recovery and the Authority for Privatization and Management of State
Ownership.

50
5.
Consolidated data on central government operations are reported for inclusion in the
GFS Yearbook, albeit with a significant time lag, while consolidated general government data
were reported for the first time for inclusion in the 2005 GFS Yearbook. Quarterly data are
not reported for IFS, but the Ministry of Finance agreed to participate in the high frequency
data project to submit monthly and quarterly cash data on the central government according
to the GFSM 2001 framework.
Monetary and Financial
6.
The National Bank of Romania (NBR) reports monetary and financial statistics on a
regular and timely basis for publication in the IFS. Since December 2004, the NBR reports
monetary data to STA using the Standardized Report Forms (SRFs), which are designed in
accordance with the methodology in the Monetary and Financial Statistics Manual (MFSM).
The monetary data in the SRFs format are being published in the new IFS Supplement,
beginning with the first issue (September 2006). The IFS Supplement contains data for
countries that regularly report monetary data in accordance with the MFSM methodology.
7.
Nevertheless, monetary statistics need to be reconciled with government finance
statistics. In line with 1993 SNA and MFSM, accrued interest on deposits and loans, and
securities other than shares should be incorporated in the corresponding outstanding amount
of the financial instrument.
8.
Romania is one of the first 40 countries whose data and metadata for financial
soundness indicators (FSIs) are posted on the IMF’s website
(http://www.imf.org/external/np/sta/fsi/eng/cce/index.htm).
Balance of Payments
9.
The NBR routinely reports balance of payments statistics to the Fund in a timely
fashion. A 2003 STA mission undertook a detailed review of the NBR’s compilation
methodology for balance of payments and international investment position statistics,
developed in consultation with Eurostat, and concluded that the proposed system is broadly
appropriate. The STA mission supported implementation of this compilation system in 2004,
along with a new FDI survey.

APPENDIX IV ROMANIA. EXTERNAL AND PUBLIC DEBT SUSTAINABILITY
A. External Sustainability
1.
With appropriate policies in place, Romania’s external sustainability will remain
under control over the medium term. Under the baseline scenario, the external debt-toGDP ratio is expected to decrease slightly to about 32 percent over the medium term.
Romania’s gross external financing needs are projected to increase from 20¼ to 23½ percent
of GDP in 2007, after which they are expected to fall steadily, reaching 17½ percent of GDP
by the end of the projection period.
2.
The standard stress tests (B1-B4) show that Romania’s external debt would
remain under control in all scenarios. In all cases, debt ratios would end up well below
40 percent at the end of the projection period. The highest ratio is reached in case of a current
account shock, which would lead to a debt-to-GDP ratio of 37¼ percent. In the case of a
depreciation, debt levels would initially jump to 55½ percent of GDP, but then steadily fall
back to 31½ percent by the end of the 2012. Because of these risks, and since external
sustainability is viewed as the greatest medium-term risk, policies to contain domestic
demand (through lower consumption and import growth) remain key to maintain Romania’s
external sustainability.
B. Fiscal Sustainability
3.
Public sector debt is expected to remain under control over the medium term.
With appropriate policies in place, the primary balance would remain in surplus over the
medium term. This path of fiscal accounts would lead to a fall in the public sector debt from
the current level of 18½ percent of GDP to about 11½ percent of GDP by 2012. A primary
deficit of 0.7 percent of GDP would stabilize public debt at this level.
4.
Stress tests on public-debt dynamics suggest that fiscal sustainability remains
vulnerable to real GDP growth and interest rate shocks. Should GDP growth slow down
from its current rate of 7.7 percent to around 3 percent over the medium-term, public debt
would reach 26.1 percent of GDP by 2012. If the interest rate increased by one standard
deviation, debt would reach 25.6 percent of GDP. In case of shocks to the real exchange rate,
the primary balance, or combined shocks, however, debt ratios would remain below
25 percent of GDP throughout the projection period.

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2007 Article IV Consultation with
Romania
On May 23, 2007, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded the
Article IV consultation with Romania.1
Background
Romania stands at a historic juncture. Accession to the European Union on January 1, 2007
represents a substantial achievement and reflects a determined stabilization effort on the part of
the authorities. Output growth has been very strong at 7.7 percent for 2006, and headline
inflation has fallen, reaching 3.7 percent (year-to-year) in March 2007 compared to 8.4 percent
for the same period last year. For most of 2006, the authorities maintained a policy of fiscal
consolidation, owing to strong revenue collections and underutilization of the capital budget.
Similarly, the National Bank of Romania focused on strengthening the credibility of Romania’s
inflation-targeting framework, tightening monetary conditions and successfully meeting its end2006 inflation goal.
Nonetheless, despite healthy export growth, the current account deficit widened to 10.3 percent
of GDP in 2006, as growing excess demand, rising wages, and strong credit growth helped
prompt a surge in imports. Moreover, fiscal policy was loosened significantly in December,
driving the budget balance from a surplus in November to an end-year deficit of 1.7 percent.
The fiscal deficit target for 2007 is wider still at 2.8 percent and substantial government wage

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On
return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the
Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the
Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the
country's authorities.

2
increases have already been approved (up to 20 percent) along with an 18-percent minimumwage hike for 2007. In addition, appreciation pressures in early 2007 set the background for a
loosening of the key monetary policy instrument. The policy interest rate was cut from
8.75 percent to 8.00 percent in February and by a further 50 basis points to 7.5 percent in
March.
Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors commended Romania’s accomplishments—including strong output and
export growth, substantial disinflation, low external debt, and a comfortable level of international
reserves—which paved the way for Romania’s recent accession into the EU. Directors
cautioned, however, that the economic outlook is clouded by a widening current account
imbalance and the risk of a resurgence of inflationary pressures, as a result of strong domestic
demand that is being fuelled by rapid credit growth and procyclical fiscal and incomes policies.
Directors emphasized the need for policies that reduce vulnerabilities, support sustainable
growth, and maximize the gains from EU membership. Key medium-term challenges will be to
raise per capita income, which remains well below the EU average, and to lay the groundwork
for eventual euro adoption. Against this background and to guard against sudden shifts in
market sentiment in the current uncertain political environment, Directors called for consistent
and prudent fiscal, incomes, and monetary policies, and vigorous implementation of structural
reforms.
Directors expressed concern about the recent procyclical fiscal loosening and the possibility that
Romania may fail to meet the Maastricht criteria in its first year of EU membership. They urged
a tighter fiscal stance in 2007 to contain domestic demand, accompanied by the establishment
of prudent medium-term fiscal goals. Given Romania’s pressing expenditure needs and low
revenue ratio, Directors stressed the need to permanently boost revenue, and welcomed plans
to strengthen tax administration and broaden the tax base.
Directors urged the authorities to strengthen public financial management, restrain expenditure
growth, and enhance the quality and composition of public spending. In particular, multiple
budget revisions and back-loaded expenditure should be avoided, and all approved expenditure
should be reflected in the budget. Directors also encouraged the development of a credible
medium-term fiscal framework to enhance the transparency and effectiveness of budget
planning and execution, and to improve the efficiency of absorbing EU funds.
Directors considered that the envisaged wage policy for this year—including a sharp increase in
the minimum wage and three rounds of increases in government wages—is incompatible with
the inflation objective and could spill over to the private sector. They urged the authorities to
pursue wage increases only once a year and to ensure that these are moderate, transparent,
and fully incorporated in the budget.
Directors commended the central bank’s commitment to price stability and the success in
reducing inflation. At the same time, given the need to firmly anchor inflationary expectations

3
and the credibility of the inflation targeting framework, Directors considered the recent interest
rate cuts to be premature. They urged the authorities to increase interest rates as needed to
attain the inflation targets. Although this may put further upward pressure on the currency,
Directors noted that the exchange rate remains competitive and that the appreciation will help to
contain inflation. Directors also considered it important to avoid any deviation between the
policy and effective interest rates, and to reduce reserve requirements cautiously.
Directors were encouraged that financial soundness indicators and stress tests point to a
relatively healthy and resilient financial system. Nevertheless, they cautioned that rapid growth
of credit to the private sector, particularly foreign currency credit, can magnify medium-term
vulnerabilities. Directors therefore emphasized the importance of effective domestic and crossborder supervision and regulation, and commended the central bank’s continued progress in
developing its capacity for assessing overall stability. They welcomed the authorities’ interest in
a Financial Sector Assessment Program update this year.
Directors emphasized the importance of ambitious structural reforms to support convergence to
EU living standards. They encouraged the authorities to accelerate privatization in the energy
sector and to announce a schedule for adjusting domestic producer gas prices in line with
opportunity costs. Romania’s low labor-market participation and employment rates suggest the
need for a strategy encompassing an improved education system and enhanced labor-market
flexibility. Directors encouraged the authorities to strengthen their efforts to introduce a second
pension pillar and to improve the legal framework with a view to reducing corruption and
enhancing the business environment.

Statement by Age Bakker, Executive Director for Romania
and Lucian Croitoru, Senior Advisor to Executive Director
May 23, 2007

The broad picture
The Romanian authorities appreciate the staff report and acknowledge that the
report provides a realistic view of the policy challenges. They consider staff’s assessment
balanced and agree on the need to address imbalances. In designing their policy response to
address imbalances, the authorities aim at reaching a policy mix that is adequate to preserve
macrostability and sustain strong growth consistent with EU convergence. The authorities
thank staff for the sound and professional advice and look forward to continued cooperation.
Macroeconomic performance has been strong, but areas of concern still exist.
Growth reached 7.7 percent in 2006, with domestic demand growing even stronger. CPI
inflation has continued to fall, reaching 3.8 percent y/y at end-April, below the NBR’s 2007
target of 4 percent. Support for disinflation came from prudent macroeconomic policies,
favorable agricultural prices, and currency appreciation. Core inflation, however, remained at
around 4½ percent. Domestic credit grew sharply albeit from a still low base, associated with
expanding domestic demand and a widening current account deficit (10.2 percent of GDP
last year). With FDI covering 90 percent of the current account deficit, a pattern seen over
recent years, the overall balance-of-payments remains strong, showing foreign investors’
confidence in Romanian’s economy. Exports have remained robust, and the reserve cover is
comfortable.
Macroeconomic policies are supporting stabilization. Fiscal policy maintained a
budgetary surplus until November last year. However, spending surged in December, turning
the surplus into an annual deficit of 1.7 percent of GDP. The government exercised prudence
in the minimum wage and reined in the SOEs’ wage bill. Nonetheless, in a fragile political
environment, real increases in governmental wages were granted, adding to domesticdemand pressures. Since October 2005 the NBR has stopped intervening in the foreign
exchange market and has tightened monetary conditions, including through full sterilization.
In 2006 it raised the policy interest rate to 8.75 percent, well above inflation. With inflation
continuing to fall, and increased upward pressure on the exchange rate since end-November
2006, the NBR again limited the amount of liquidity absorbed at the policy rate, and reduced
the policy interest rate three times, to 7.25 percent between February and May 2007. The
banking system, 90 percent foreign-owned, is healthy and robust, and well-positioned to
absorb adverse shocks. Foreign banks have sophisticated risk-management policies and can
rely on external support in the event of adverse shocks.
Progress has been made in implementing structural reforms but some delays
occurred in privatizing the last state-owned bank and the energy-sector companies.

2
Judicial reform has progressed in line with Romania’s EU commitments. More recently,
domestic gas prices have been raised, but a gap still exists with respect to international
import prices. The CEC bank privatization has been postponed since the government
assessed that a better price, as compared to the one offered by the winner of the tender, could
be obtained when market conditions are more favorable, by which time the privatization will
be launched again.
Looking forward, the authorities are committed to preserving macroeconomic
stability, reducing vulnerabilities, and renewing reform efforts as prerequisites for
sustained strong growth. The authorities acknowledge that to contain external imbalances
and make further progress with disinflation, the macroeconomic policy mix needs to remain
tight. Given pressing expenditure needs, including meeting Romania’s contribution to the EU
budget, further fiscal tightening seems unfeasible in 2007. However, despite recent
reductions in interest rates, monetary conditions remain tight owing mainly to previous
appreciation and relatively high reserve requirements. The authorities acknowledge that
while the recent sharp leu appreciation has decreased external competitiveness, the exchange
rate remains competitive. Hence, a moderate further appreciation would not cause significant
deterioration in the external balance and could be accommodated as long as strong
productivity gains are sustained. The authorities are aware that achieving growth consistent
with the goal of convergence to EU living standards requires increased investment and
employment creation. Therefore, they are improving their project-implementation capacity
and are committed to further improving the investment climate, including by continuing
privatization and enterprise restructuring to support productivity gains.
Fiscal policy
The authorities’ view is that a deficit of 2.8 percent of GDP in 2007, although it
represents a relaxation in the fiscal policy, is still consistent with macrostability.
Meeting Romania’s pressing needs for infrastructure with a lower deficit would have been
possible with additional revenue measures. However, a revised Fiscal Code has been adopted
recently and the need for tax-legislation stability limits the scope for revenue measures. The
authorities are of the view that a deficit of this magnitude does not alter Romania’s sound
fundamentals, including the very low level of public debt. This, together with the anchor
provided by the EU membership, makes the country less vulnerable to an abrupt change in
market sentiment.
The authorities are confident that this deficit ceiling will not be exceeded. They
will not reduce tax rates except for the relatively high social-contributions tax and will not
allow tax exemptions. Moreover, the authorities have plans to strengthen the tax
administration in line with IMF staff and World Bank recommendations. They will
implement measures to modernize the tax administration, broaden the tax base, and to
address shortcomings in the organizational structure and legal mandate of the Agency for
Fiscal Administration. These improvements should strengthen revenues even this year.

3

The authorities agree that the institutional setting of fiscal policy needs to be
strengthened by improving transparency, enhancing monitoring, and developing a
medium-term fiscal framework. They acknowledge that the practice of multiple budget
revisions and a skewed spending pattern, with surges in spending towards the end of the year,
undermine the credibility of fiscal policy. In 2007 they intend to limit the number of budget
revisions to one, as compared to four last year, as already provided for in their medium-term
budgetary framework. The authorities are also working on creating mechanisms to ensure the
efficient allocation of resources and absorption of the EU inflows, which will help
implementing a uniform spending pattern over the year.
Wage policy
The wage policy envisaged for 2007 is looser as compared to last year, when it
helped manage demand pressures and protect the competitiveness of the Romanian
economy. In part, the loosening of the wage policy was needed to ensure an adequately
skilled public sector labor force, but pressure from trade unions and the fragile political
environment also exerted significant influence. The importance of maintaining and attracting
high-skilled staff in the public sector is high at the present juncture given that drawing EU
funds requires adequate management. The authorities acknowledge the risks of a loose wage
policy and the strain it puts on reaching inflation objectives. Since reducing the envisaged
increases is not feasible, the authorities will focus on controlling bonuses and closely
monitoring additional hirings. This year the authorities were not successful in limiting the
number of wage increases to only one to help anchoring inflation expectations. However,
they have started preparations to attain this objective as of 2008, thus terminating the interim
ad hoc increases seen in the past.
Monetary policy
The NBR is strongly committed to inflation targeting. It targets a CPI inflation of
4 percent for 2007 and 3.8 percent for 20081. The NBR’s view is that these targets are
feasible, and the Bank stands ready to take all necessary steps to attain them. Recent cuts in
the policy interest rate should not be viewed as a loosening of its commitment. When it
decided to reduce interest rates in early 2007, the NBR started from the fact that monetary
conditions were tight, a stance visible in disinflation overperformance relative to the target.
The overperformance was supported by the previous appreciation, the level of reserve
requirements, and the level of the effective interest rate itself. Even at the current level, in
real terms, the effective interest rate is marginally above the neutral level estimated by the
NBR. While remaining focused on inflation, the NBR is concerned about excessive shortterm appreciation. This could leave the economy vulnerable to a sudden reversal, with
negative consequences for the pace of disinflation and for the financial sector. The NBR

1

These are the central values at end-year with ±1 percent band.

4
stresses that the small departure from the policy of full sterilization is of a temporary nature
and plans to reunify the policy and effective interest rates as soon as possible.
The authorities maintain vigilance regarding strong credit growth. While rapid
credit growth is a reflection of the real convergence in the financial sector, an overly rapid
credit growth reflects the continuing strength of excess demand, with its associated mediumterm vulnerabilities, and can magnify existing distortions. To tame credit growth, over the
past few years the NBR has imposed administrative measures and high reserve requirements,
distortions of which could be even higher than those associated with overly rapid credit
growth. Therefore, debt-to-income ratios imposed by the NBR at the bank levels for
household credit have been removed recently. Continuing to align with EU practice, and to
reduce costs on domestic banks, the NBR is now considering reducing reserve requirements,
which are much above those in the EU. In doing this, the NBR is going to proceed with
caution, including by choosing an appropriate timing, so that reductions will not add to
macroeconomic imbalances.
The capacity for assessing financial-sector stability is being strengthened. The
NBR started publishing its Financial Stability Report last year and a second report will be
issued by mid-2007. The banking system remains resilient to the direct impact of interest-rate
and exchange-rate movements, as well as a growth slowdown, as suggested by the NBR
stress tests. However, predicting consequences of a less benign economic environment is
more difficult for indirect exposures through loan portfolio, which is difficult to assess in the
context of rapid credit growth. In view of this, the authorities are encouraging high capital
ratios and conservative provisioning practices. Building on the substantial progress made in
strengthening the regulatory and supervisory framework, the NBR enhanced its cooperation
with regulatory and supervisory authorities in other countries. To ensure a rapid and
coordinated response to potential cross-border banking problems, Memoranda of
Understanding have been signed for all banks operating in Romania, and NBR staff is
already participating in drills with other authorities. The authorities intend to have an FSAP
update this year.
Structural reforms
Continuation of structural reforms is crucial for real convergence. After
increasing energy prices recently, the authorities are determined to continue more firmly with
the adjustments to eliminate the gap from international prices by end-2008. However, the
authorities have not announced a more detailed calendar for such increases. They also are
determined to continue with the privatization of CEC and of energy-sector companies.
Reforming the pension system has continued with the preparations for the second pillar and
the authorities’ plan to introduce it on January 2008. The authorities will also continue
firmly with the implementation of their judicial reform agenda.
