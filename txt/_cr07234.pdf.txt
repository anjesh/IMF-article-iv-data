Executive Summary
Background
•

The growth outlook and external position remain robust, but inflation has picked up.
Strong inflows from remittances and exports have contributed to a more comfortable
reserve position, but have complicated monetary management.

•

Money and credit aggregates expanded at a rapid rate in the first half of the fiscal year
and domestic financing of the budget went off track. As a result, several performance
criteria were missed. Macroeconomic policies are being brought back in line with program
targets, but this process will extend beyond the mid-June expiration date of the PRGF
arrangement, precluding completion of the sixth review.

•

Most of the macroeconomic objectives of the PRGF program were achieved. A key
success is the viability of the external sector, which was transformed following the shift to a
flexible exchange rate regime. Although fiscal discipline was maintained, a major
disappointment is the failure to significantly raise the low revenue-to-GDP ratio.

•

The authorities are targeting a more realistic FY08 budget, with a small increase in
revenue supported by specific measures and an increase in development spending
consistent with implementation capacity.

•

The transitional government has moved forward with a number of previously stalled
economic reforms. Recent decisions include significant adjustments in energy prices,
corporatization of the nationalized commercial banks, and a range of governance reforms.

Key Policy Issues
•

Staff recommended monetary tightening to curb inflationary pressures. There is also
scope for more flexibility in the exchange rate given the improved reserve position.

•

Staff argued for fundamental reform of the revenue system to achieve the full
benefits of tax administration reform, support further trade reform, and provide resources
for the immense development needs.

•

Banking risks appear to be manageable, but stricter prudential rules and
enforcement are needed to avoid future potential risks particularly in the context of
rapid credit growth. Reform of the large insolvent state banks would help improve
incentives for greater efficiency of financial intermediation.

•

Pricing reform and state-owned enterprise restructuring is still needed. April fuel price
increases brought domestic prices more in line with international prices, but further
adjustments are needed for fuel, as well as electricity, natural gas, and fertilizer. To increase
fiscal transparency, the government plans to assume the nonperforming loans of the
petroleum company with the state banks, and this step needs to be supported by measures to
avoid future losses.

I. POLITICAL BACKGROUND AND RECENT DEVELOPMENTS
1.
Elections that were scheduled for January 2007 did not take place. A few days
before the scheduled elections, emergency rule was declared and a transitional government
(TG) installed. The Bangladesh Nationalist Party government of Prime Minister Khaleda Zia
stepped down on October 28, 2006 and, as required by the constitution, handed over to a
caretaker government to prepare for elections within 90 days. However, street protests and
blockades escalated as the Grand Alliance, led by Sheik Hasina Wajed of the Awami League,
objected to the non-neutrality of the election commission. With Bangladesh facing the almost
certain prospect of widespread violence following a one-sided election that the Grand
Alliance had decided to boycott, on January 11, 2007, the President stepped down as head of
the caretaker government, declared emergency rule, and installed a transitional government.
2.
The TG, which enjoys widespread support for its anti-corruption campaign,
announced that elections would take place before the end of 2008. Led by former
Bangladesh Bank (BB) Governor Fakhruddin Ahmed, the TG is moving aggressively to rein
in corrupt elements and repair the electoral process to help ensure fair elections. Scores of
businessmen and senior officials (including former ministers from both parties) have been
arrested and the Anti-Corruption Commission has been empowered to proceed with
prosecutions. The Election Commission has been reconstituted and arrangements are in place
to create a new voter list and issue voter IDs. The TG has undertaken a number of
previously-stalled reforms, motivating the World Bank to proceed with a budget support
operation (Development Support Credit IV) that was approved on May 29.
3.
Macroeconomic performance in FY07 has been mixed: growth and external
indicators are sound, but fiscal performance weakened in the first part of the year and
inflation has picked up.
•

Growth remains strong at a projected 6¾ percent
spurred by export demand and rising private
domestic investment financed by external current
receipts and credit growth. Agriculture rebounded
in FY06, but is expected to slow in FY07, while
manufacturing and service activity have firmed in
the first half of the year. Inflation (y/y) edged up
to over 7 percent by March 2007 reflecting both
food and nonfood prices (Table 1).

The exchange rate has been relatively stable, and
the reserve buildup continued throughout the
political upheaval. Net international reserves at
over $3 billion have exceeded program targets on
the back of continued strong remittances and
exports that are growing at annual rates of 25 and
21 percent, respectively (Table 2).

General

Fiscal performance, however, went off track in the
first half of the year. Spending by the outgoing
government, coupled with weak revenue
collection, pushed domestic financing to well
above the end-December PRGF performance
criterion. While development spending is being
cut back to remain within the budgeted deficit, the
annual revenue target is no longer achievable
(Table 3).
Bangladesh Bank did little to further tighten its
monetary stance as government credit soared.
Broad money growth reached a record high of
22 percent in December and private sector credit
grew close to 20 percent. With T-bill rates
increasing very gradually (by only 10–22 basis
points since June), BB absorbed a large share of
issued government paper and missed its endDecember NDA performance criterion
(Tables 4–6). Reflecting better control of
government finances since January, end-March
NDA had come below the program target, and
reserve money declined marginally, but still
remains high reflecting the increase in net foreign
assets. With ample liquidity, bank lending and
deposit interest rates have seen only modest
increases (Tables 7–8).

4.
The TG moved swiftly on decisions related to some stalled reforms. It has
approved corporatization of the remaining nationalized commercial banks (NCBs), one of the
two PRGF structural performance criteria for March. Three structural benchmarks were met:
(i) eliminating overruns in the net open foreign exchange position of the NCBs;
(ii) eliminating the ad hoc treasury system and introducing an auction mechanism with
preannounced quantities; and (iii) reviewing and strengthening the existing social safety net
programs (to be implemented with the FY08 budget) following a study on ways to mitigate

6
the impact of fuel price adjustments on vulnerable groups. However, the structural
benchmark related to improving coordination between the large taxpayer units (LTUs), and
the remaining structural performance criterion related to assigning unique taxpayer ID
numbers to large taxpayers, were not met (Table 9). Nonobservance of several performance
criteria and delays in bringing revenue performance in line with program objectives preclude
completion of the sixth and final PRGF review before the June 19 expiration of the PRGF
arrangement.
5.
The pace of reform implementation has also picked up in other areas. In addition
to the reforms agreed for the sixth review, the TG approved the sale of the remaining
minority shares of Rupali Bank; intervened to manage the failing Oriental Bank that had
previously been given effective immunity; adopted pending resolutions on the separation of
the judiciary from the executive branch; placed the new container terminal at Chittagong port
under private management; raised electricity tariffs by 5 percent in March, and fuel prices by
16–21 percent in April, and established a committee to regularly review and recommend fuel
price adjustments. More comprehensive energy sector reforms are being initiated in
consultation with the World Bank and the AsDB.
II. POLICY DISCUSSIONS
A. Progress Toward Key Objectives of the PRGF-Supported Program
6.
Most of the PRGF’s original macroeconomic objectives have been attained.
Adoption of a flexible exchange rate regime helped the economy weather the external shocks
from the phaseout of MFA quotas and higher oil prices; the overall government deficit
remained well below program targets in each year (albeit mainly due to slow project
implementation) and domestic financing was contained with the exception of the overrun
earlier this year. Moreover, tangible progress was made in bringing several MDG targets
within reach, including reductions in the poverty rate, improved access to primary education,
gender equality, and reductions in child mortality.

7.
However, revenue performance has been a disappointment. The revenue-to-GDP
ratio increased by less than ½ percent of GDP over four years of the program. Failure to
improve revenue mobilization may have resulted from deficiencies in overall tax design, the
slower-than-anticipated pace of administrative reforms (due to institutional rigidities),
including delays in establishing the LTUs, and lack of improvement in customs
administration to limit revenue losses associated with trade liberalization.
8.
Structural reforms under the PRGF program generally proceeded at a slow pace
with occasional backsliding. The PRGF structural agenda focused mainly on the areas of
revenue and NCB reforms, while other critical areas such as governance, state-owned
enterprises (SOE) reform, and public finance management were covered by the World Bank,
AsDB, and DfID. Although Bangladesh continues to rank low with respect to political
stability, regulatory quality, and control of corruption, some progress has been achieved in
improving the private sector environment and increasing social spending.
9.
Improving the exchange rate system, strengthening central bank operations, and
offering for sale one of the smaller NCBs were among the more successful areas of
reform. Supported by Fund technical assistance, BB

11.
The authorities emphasized the improved external position, sustained growth,
and poverty reduction as the main achievements under the PRGF-supported
framework. At the same time, they noted that while there were delays along the way,
structural reforms moved forward in all key areas. However, they recognized that revenue
collections are still very low compared with other countries and more needed to be done to
strengthen both revenue policy and administration.
B. Economic Outlook, Development Challenges, and Risks
12.
Growth is expected to remain around 6½–7 percent over the medium term.

Providing economic opportunities to the

vast poor population will remain an immense
challenge for some time to come. Although strong
200
growth has helped reduce poverty, Bangladesh still
0
lags behind its Asian neighbors in terms of its
business climate and on key economic and social
indicators due to deficiencies in social services and infrastructure (Figures 2 and 3). Catching
up will entail capitalizing on the regional growth boom to unlock its potential for sustained

consultation (IMF Country Report 05/242).

9
high growth. In addition, improved public finances and better financial intermediation remain
key priorities to help provide access to resources and opportunities to the vast poor
population. If absorptive capacity were significantly enhanced, increased aid could help
remove constraints to allow more progress on poverty alleviation.2
14.
A number of risks could lead to slower growth or a weaker external position.
Although exchange and trade reforms have helped improve resilience to external shocks, the
external position is highly dependent on garment exports, which may be vulnerable to
intensified competition and shifting sentiments in global markets, although a mild slowdown
in major economies would likely have a limited impact on demand for the lower-value-added
apparel comprising the bulk of exports. Political stability will be an important factor in
sustaining investor confidence; the destructive political rivalry of the last three decades,
together with weak accountability and rule of law, has squandered a good portion of
available resources. The future outlook will depend to a large extent on the TG’s ability to
bring about credible elections while maintaining broad public support.
C. Fiscal Policy and Tax Reform
15.
Staff commended the authorities’ adherence to overall fiscal discipline, but
noted that the quality of fiscal performance continued to be weak. The overall fiscal
deficit and domestic financing have been contained to below 4 percent and 2 percent of GDP
respectively, but as noted above, revenue shortfalls persisted. In addition, a deterioration of
SOE finances and mounting arrears between state entities have undermined the public
sector’s financial position, and structural rigidities have persistently hampered
implementation of the development budget.
16.
Recognition of these weaknesses was largely
shared by the authorities. They explained that
raising revenue has been particularly challenging in
the context of trade reform, but concurred with the
need to broaden the tax base and continue to shift
away from trade taxes. The staff welcomed the
current government’s intention to consider revenue
reforms, strengthen public financial management,
restructure SOEs, and improve fiscal transparency.

The staff strongly encouraged the
authorities to initiate fundamental reform of the
revenue system. A recent FAD tax policy mission saw little scope for improving tax revenue

10
collection from administration reforms alone and recommended a complete overhaul of tax
legislation (Box 1). Staff suggested that the next steps to initiate such reform would entail:
(i) clearly separating tax policy from administration; (ii) forming a tax reform commission that
would oversee the process; and (iii) confirming that no further tax holidays will be granted
after their planned expiration at end-June 2008. The authorities accepted that addressing the
persistent revenue shortfalls in a sustainable way is the key fiscal challenge and they are
considering action in all of these areas. FAD has expressed willingness to provide follow-up
assistance when the authorities confirm their readiness to move forward with key reforms.
18.
Further efforts are needed to augment ongoing revenue administration reform.
Staff observed that establishment of the LTUs has been an important step, and the pickup in
revenue collected by the income tax LTU is an important sign of the potential collection gains.
To reinforce these efforts, staff recommended consolidation of the income tax and VAT units
into a single LTU as operations would benefit considerably from better cooperation,
information sharing, and joint audits of taxpayers. The government is considering possible ways
to implement this recommendation within existing civil service and institutional constraints.
The authorities were also urged to complete the introduction of single large taxpayer ID
numbers and to strengthen the operations of the Central Intelligence Cell.
19.
In the FY08 budget, the authorities intend to aim at a modest increase in
revenue. The authorities are planning for an
30
increase in revenue to 10.7 percent of GDP based

30 percent to align it more closely with the
corporate tax rate. Further reducing exemptions and better revenue administration would help
supplement revenue performance while a more fundamental reform of the revenue system
is initiated.
20.
Expenditure priorities in FY08 will focus on higher social safety net spending
and a 0.6 percent of GDP increase in the annual development program. The overall
budget deficit is targeted to increase to 5.2 percent of GDP after assuming the stock of
nonperforming loans of the BPC with domestic banks amounting to 1.6 percent of GDP.
These nonperforming loans represent two-thirds of the total stock of BPC’s bank borrowing
to finance its losses over the years. The underlying deficit (i.e., the overall deficit excluding

11
the impact of assuming SOE debt) would remain around 3½ percent of GDP. With respect to
public financial management, the planned expansion of the medium-term budget framework
(MTBF) to four additional ministries (for a total of 14) during FY08 paves the way for a
more consolidated MTBF. Moreover, adoption of a regulatory framework to implement the
Public Procurement Act of June 2006 will help improve the efficiency of expenditure and
project implementation.
21.
The authorities have requested technical assistance (TA) to further improve
their debt management capacity. MCM is considering how best to address this request.
The analysis and conclusions of the most recent debt sustainability analysis (DSA)(IMF
Country Report No. 06/406, November 2006), showing low risk of external debt distress and
moderate risk of public debt distress, remain fundamentally valid. Bank and Fund staff intend
to initiate the next update of the DSA in early 2008 in line with the expected timing of the
2008 Article IV consultation, and to involve the authorities in its preparation. Improving debt
management and enhancing absorptive capacity would be especially important if additional
aid flows materialize.

Staff saw a need for further monetary tightening in the face of strong inflows
and rising inflation. In recent months, ample liquidity (arising from strong exports and
remittances) has emerged as the main challenge for monetary policy. In the face of rapid
credit expansion, money market rates have remained unchanged since mid-2006, and banks’
excess reserves have risen above levels envisaged in the program. Although currency growth
has declined in the last three months, monetary aggregates continue to exceed
program targets.
23.
In its January policy statement, BB stated its intention to keep unchanged its
policy of “cautious restraint” with a view to support

staff noted that the recent jump in inflation above

7 percent, coupled with the expected impact of the

monetary tightening to firmly anchor inflationary

expectations. The authorities were more optimistic

than staff that overall inflation would come back

below 7 percent by the end of the fiscal year as supply
constraints eased, and that an early tightening of policy might dampen growth momentum.
They have taken some administrative measures to control commodity prices (see ¶36) and
pledged to monitor the situation closely in the coming months. The next monetary policy
statement is expected to be released in July.

12
24.
Following on the advice of MCM TA, progress has been made in moving more
toward the market-based conduct of monetary policy. The government’s borrowing
requirement has become more predictable with broad adherence to the auction calendar for
government securities announced in September 2006. The Ministry of Finance is preparing
the grounds for secondary market and yield curve development and has issued a large share
of long-term securities this fiscal year. Recent steps taken to encourage activity of primary
dealers will reduce the need for BB to absorb primary issues of government securities. Over
time, this should facilitate increased reliance on transactions in government securities in the
secondary market as the main instrument of monetary policy, supported by repos/reverse
repos and sales of BB securities as needed. As a next step, the authorities agreed to consider
staff’s recommendation of eliminating the up-front tax on government securities, which
distorts security pricing and may undermine the development of a secondary market.

26.
The staff saw scope for more exchange rate flexibility to support the objectives
of monetary policy. The central bank’s purchase of over $400 million from the market since
January has restrained taka appreciation in the face of strong inflows. Along with monetary
tightening, staff also advised there was scope to moderate the pace of reserve accumulation
and allow for greater flexibility in the exchange rate. Given the more comfortable reserve
position, staff also urged removal of the restriction on the transferability of proceeds from
nonresident taka accounts (Annex I). The authorities emphasized that their intervention
policy is geared toward stabilizing market conditions and taking advantage of opportunities
to increase their international reserve position, in line with the commitments they have made
in their Memorandum of Economic and Financial Policies. In principle, they were willing to
accept more movement in the exchange rate going forward in line with market conditions.
With respect to the exchange restriction, they still saw a small risk that removing it could
precipitate capital outflows and were not willing to commit to a specific timetable for
its removal.

E. Financial Sector Issues
27.
Bangladesh Bank (BB) has advanced reforms aimed at deepening financial
markets. The regulatory framework has been strengthened, off-site and on-site supervision has
been enhanced and steps taken to restructure, corporatize, and privatize the large nationalized
comercial banks (NCBs). However, the observed improvements in published aggregate
indicators of bank soundness conceal wide divergences in individual banks’ performance and
mask underlying weaknesses in the banking system due to underestimation of the
capital shortfall.
28.
Financial sector risks appear to be manageable, but further efforts are needed to
strengthen the monitoring framework. The authorities noted that many recommendations from
the 2002 Financial Sector Assessment

shortfalls (doubling to 4 percent of
GDP if international loan classification and provisioning rules were applied). In addition, there is
an estimated capital shortfall of 2–3 percent of GDP in the four development banks, mainly due
to the government’s repeated loan forgiveness to clients without compensating the banks. Three
out of 40 private banks do not meet the required 9 percent capital adequacy ratio and are on BB’s
closely-watched list.
29.
The staff called for more vigilance in implementing the NCB restructuring and
divestment program to help promote banking sector soundness. Privatization of Rupali and
corporatization of the three remaining NCBs will bring them more directly under BB’s
supervision. The staff agreed with the authorities that to be effective, corporatization will need to
be accompanied by appointment of qualified directors who can guide and implement the
restructuring programs at these banks. The government should also review the role of the
development banks in achieving its policy objectives and ways to improve their performance.

14
30.
Improving NCB performance would also help enhance financial intermediation.
Although the share of state banks’ assets has significantly declined, the continued dominance of
these banks diminishes incentives to improve the overall performance of the sector by providing
scope for the existence of some weak private commercial banks while the more efficient ones
can collect high rents. Interest rate spreads are high by comparative standards and inefficiencies
of the domestic banking system are allowing foreign banks to reap large profits.

of its implementation of the recommendations of the 2002 FSAP and has requested an IMF/WB
mission to review their findings and conduct an FSAP update.
F. SOE, Price, and Governance Reforms
32.
The staff saw an urgent need to address
accumulating quasi-fiscal losses of SOEs. April fuel
price adjustments of 21 percent for petrol, and 16 percent
for diesel and kerosene, will bring annual losses down
from around ¾ percent of GDP in FY06 and FY07 to
about ½ percent of GDP in FY08 in the absence of further
changes in domestic or international prices. At current
levels, domestic prices are at 88 percent of break-even
levels on average, with diesel prices exhibiting the widest
gap at 80 percent of the break-even level and considerably
below prices in bordering India.

The staff welcomed the authorities’ intention to resolve BPC’s losses in a
transparent manner. The BPC’s losses accumulated in the past and its associated overdue
loans from NCBs, amount to 1.6 percent of GDP. The mission supported the authorities’
intention to issue government securities to assume the overdue loans and to make necessary
provisions in the budget. However, to avoid the re-accumulation of losses in BPC, it would
be important to: (i) introduce an automatic mechanism of price adjustment; (ii) improve the

15
operational efficiency of BPC; and (iii) ensure that BPC increasingly seeks trade financing
on commercial terms without a government guarantee.
34.
Price adjustments and financial restructuring of other loss-making SOEs are
also needed. BPC alone accounts for about two-thirds of accumulated SOE losses, with the
state airline, fertilizer, and power companies accounting for the remainder.4 Further
adjustments in electricity tariffs and fertilizer prices, and financial restructuring of the stateowned electricity companies, will be needed. Besides pricing reform and financial
restructuring, there is scope for further divestment from among the remaining 47 SOEs, and
the World Bank and AsDB are working with the authorities on regulatory reform to promote
investment in expanding power generation.
35.
Staff reiterated the merits of adjusting natural gas prices. The pricing of natural
gas is considerably below international levels, resulting in the forfeiture of a significant
source of government revenue and creating substantial market distortions by encouraging
conversion to CNG as a source of fuel. Higher gas prices will imply a need for further
adjustment in electricity and fertilizer prices, but reform of energy sector policy will be
incomplete and distortionary unless adjustment of gas prices is included. The authorities
indicated their intention to continue with adjustment of administrated prices to put SOE
finances on a sound basis, but were reluctant to consider adjustment of natural gas until
petroleum, electricity, and fertilizer price adjustments are completed.
36.
Staff warned that recent administrative measures to control commodity prices
may be counterproductive. The authorities are understandably concerned by increases in
the prices of some basic food commodities. Staff, however, advised that some of the
government’s ongoing and proposed administrative measures that seek to regulate stock
levels and pricing policies of private traders could have created market distortions and
uncertainty in the business environment, thereby contributing to shortages and additional
price pressures. Staff encouraged the authorities to contain emerging inflationary pressures
through appropriate monetary and exchange rate policies. In conjunction with
macroeconomic policies, staff strongly supported the authorities’ efforts to enhance targeted
social safety net programs to provide assistance to the poor and protect their
consumption possibilities.
37.
Tackling governance problems is crucial for improving the investment climate.
Donors have welcomed the government’s recent emphasis on governance reforms and are
providing capacity-building support. The capacity of the Ministry of Finance to oversee
public expenditure and the Comptroller and Auditor-General’s office to carry out
independent audits are being strengthened. Following reconstitution of the Anti-Corruption
Commission, filing of dozens of corruption charges and launching an investigation period,
4

A selected issues paper takes stock of SOE finances and their contribution to public sector performance.

16
the first three cases of corruption charges of former senior government officials were
initiated by the special courts. The anti-money laundering and combating the financing of
terrorism (AML/CFT) framework is also being strengthened, most recently with the initiation
of a Financial Intelligence Unit in May 2007. To improve fiscal transparency, the
government now includes a list of government guarantees in the budget document and is
taking steps to reflect SOE losses directly in the budget.
G. Other Issues and Future Fund Engagement
38.
Economic data are adequate for surveillance, but significant weaknesses remain.
Planned Fund TA will support the authorities’ efforts to address deficiencies identified in the
2005 ROSC in the areas of national accounts, balance of payments, debt monitoring, and
government finance statistics.
39.
A full PRSP was completed in November 2005. Work has been initiated on a PRSP
implementation report that is expected to be completed by end-2007.
40.
The authorities are keen to advance the reform agenda under their tenure. The
Chief Advisor and Finance Advisor confirmed their preparedness to move on the critical
areas of comprehensive overhaul of the revenue system, improvements in fiscal transparency,
administrative reforms of NBR, and further financial sector reforms, and have expressed
interest in a new PRGF arrangement. The staff considers that an arrangement would support
further structural reforms and continued macroeconomic stabilization. In addition to the
recently approved Development Support Credit (DSC-IV) of $200 million, the World Bank
has scheduled a Board discussion for an education sector policy loan ($100 million) in
June 2007, and is planning a possible follow-up budget support operation in 2008.
III. STAFF APPRAISAL
41.
Most of the PRGF’s macroeconomic objectives were achieved in the last four
years. Growth has averaged 6.4 percent, inflation was largely contained, international
reserves increased to around three months of import coverage, and the fiscal deficit and
public debt were contained despite revenue shortfalls. Moreover, the poverty headcount
declined by 2 percentage points annually and several MDG targets are within reach.
However, revenue targets under the program were consistently missed and progress in some
key areas of structural reform was less than envisaged.
42.
With sustained reform efforts, growth is expected to remain around
6½–7 percent. Broad-based growth with low inflation, and revenue enhancement to finance
social programs, are both crucial for further reducing poverty. In addition to reliance on
buoyant export and remittance flows, and possibly higher foreign investment and aid flows,
investment impediments—infrastructure and skill deficiencies, power shortages, and
perceptions of corruption—need to be addressed.

17
43.
Exchange rate reform was among the principal successes under the PRGFsupported program, facilitating double digit export growth in the post MFA era and
attainment of a more comfortable reserve position. Other areas of progress include lessening
dependence on central bank financing, strengthening central bank operations and its
monitoring of the financial sector, and corporatization of the large insolvent nationalized
banks to facilitate their restructuring and eventual sale.
44.
However, revenue performance was a disappointment. At around 10½ percent of
GDP, revenue collection is among the lowest in the world, inadequate to meet the pressing
social spending needs, and virtually unchanged over the last four years compared to a
programmed annual increase of ½ percent of GDP—pointing to inadequate efforts to date.
45.
Fundamental reform of the tax system should be a central component of fiscal
policy going forward. Responsibility for tax policy and collection should be separated while
VAT and income tax legislation should be redrafted to reduce exemptions and make the laws
easier to administer. In the meantime, stronger efforts should be made to cut back on
exemptions and broaden the tax base to supplement revenue performance.
46.
Ongoing tax administration measures also need to be more effectively executed.
Merging the LTUs would improve their effectiveness by pooling information and resources.
47.
Revenue reforms would also allow for further reduction in tariffs and
supplementary duties. Although there has been a welcome shift away from reliance on trade
taxes, it has been constrained by insufficient efforts to mobilize alternative revenue sources,
and nominal protection remains among the highest in the region.
48.
Public financial management reforms would help improve the efficiency of
expenditure and project implementation and could help to attract more donor
resources. Following the adoption of MTBF in 14 ministries, the overall budget should be
prepared within a medium-term framework. Impediments to implementation of the annual
development program will need to be addressed to improve budget execution.
49.
SOE reforms are needed to curb fiscal costs and ease infrastructure bottlenecks.
To stem future accumulation of losses, the government should combine plans to assume the
nonperforming loans of the petroleum company with operational restructuring measures and
an automatic price adjustment mechanism, and initiate price and governance reforms in the
other major public enterprises.
50.
Bangladesh Bank should build on recent financial sector reforms. Monitoring
should be strengthened in the context of rapid credit growth by some banks, and regulations
need to be brought more in line with international standards—and be more strictly
enforced—so that bank soundness can be more accurately assessed. Staff welcomes the
authorities’ initiation of a self-assessment of the FSAP recommendations, and their
preparedness for an FSAP update.

18
51.
Further monetary tightening would help curb inflationary expectations. Recent
hikes in food and fuel prices are expected to drive up inflation temporarily and could, in the
absence of corrective policies, propel inflation into FY08. Developing a secondary market for
securities would contribute to enhancing monetary policy and support financial
sector development.
52.
Improvements in the external position should provide scope for further
development of the foreign exchange market. The flexible exchange rate regime has
helped maintain competitiveness in the face of external shocks and the factious domestic
political climate, and remains appropriate. There is no evidence of a significant misalignment
in the rate given recent performance of exports and remittances. Now that international
reserves are at more comfortable levels, confining intervention to stabilizing disorderly
market conditions will allow for more flexibility in the nominal rate and support stabilization
objectives. The remaining exchange restriction on the transferability of funds in nonresident
taka accounts should be removed and, given the lack of a specific timetable for its removal,
staff does not recommend approval of the restriction.
53.
Staff welcomes the recent emphasis on governance reforms. Ongoing reforms that
aim to ensure more transparency and good governance in public administration, operation of
public service facilities, the election process, the prevention of money laundering and
terrorism financing, and in the judiciary will, if sustained, upgrade Bangladesh’s relatively
low ratings thereby giving a boost to the investment climate.
54.
Continued efforts to address deficiencies in economic statistics will also be
needed. The authorities are encouraged to give more priority to upgrading statistics and to
make good use of forthcoming technical assistance.
55.
It is recommended that the next consultation with Bangladesh take place within the
standard 12-month cycle.

Box 1. Bangladesh: Comparative Revenue Performance
Revenue performance improved slightly during the PRGF-supported program, but fell
short of program objectives and remains one of the lowest for PRGF-eligible countries. At

Tax rates are not low, but rather the tax system
is inefficient. The statutory nominal tax rates for

nominal tax rate) is lower than for other

There are multiple reasons for the weak
performance. A recent FAD TA tax policy mission identified several reasons for low
efficiency in revenue collection: (i) excessive use of tax holidays; (ii) basic design flaws of key
tax laws; and (iii) poor compliance. The mission determined that prospects for securing a
significantly higher tax-to-GDP ratio would not be good without fundamental reform of the tax
system involving among other things redrafting of key legislation.

Estimates based on cross-country regressions on tax-to-GDP ratios and revenue

administrative reforms (including the eventual merger of the LTUs) for a country at
Bangladesh’s income level.

Box 2. Bangladesh: Financial Sector Performance1
The financial sector is dominated by commercial
banks, which account for 90 percent of financial
system assets. With broad money and total credit at
40 and 30 percent of GDP, respectively, financial
deepening lags behind most Asian countries.

70
60
50

Banking system performance has improved overall
with increased competition and strengthened
regulation and supervision. Entry of new banks
following financial liberalization helped stimulate
financial intermediation, reducing the share of the four
nationalized banks (NCBs) and five specialized
development banks (SDBs) from 68 percent in 1997 to
41 percent of banking assets in 2006.
•

•

Asset quality indicators have improved,
but provisioning remains low. The last
FSAP found that in 2002, 35 percent of
NCBs’ and 56 percent of SDBs’ loans were
nonperforming and these have declined to
23 and 34 percent, respectively. Only 4 out
of 30 private banks have NPL ratios in
excess of 10 percent compared to 11 banks
in 2002. However, rapid credit growth may
be masking NPL ratios and provisioning
remains low except in the foreign banks.
High interest rate spreads point to
widespread inefficiencies. Operational
inefficiencies of NCBs have allowed foreign
banks to benefit from high spreads and reap
a return of 4 percent on assets.

Recent deposit and credit growth is a
welcome sign of financial deepening, but need
to be monitored for potential risk factors.
Private bank lending has increased by an average of 35 percent annually over the last three years,
and high loan-to-deposit ratios of some banks suggest rising liquidity constraints. Available data
do not point to risks from sectoral loan concentration: short-term trade finance and working
capital together account for 50 percent of total loans outstanding (and two-thirds of all loans are of
less than one year maturity). Housing credit is estimated at less than 5 percent of total lending in
2005. Lending in foreign currency is mainly confined to trade-related credits, and most banks are
within BB’s limits of net open positions, thereby limiting vulnerability to foreign exchange risk.

Indicative Targets
Revised
Target 3/
Proj.

1/ The aggregates are defined in the Technical Memorandum of Understanding dated January 9, 2006.
2/ Cumulative flow since start of financial year beginning July 1.
3/ Targets for end-June 2007 will be monitored outside of the PRGF-supported program that will expire on June 19, 2007.
4/ Performance criteria assessed on a periodic basis under the program period.
5/ Targets for FY07 are subject to an adjustor depending on the magnitude and timing of the World Bank's DSC (currently expected to be worth US$200 million and
to be disbursed in the fourth quarter of FY07) and other budgetary support. Targets have been adjusted for AsDB budget support of $30.69 (Tk2.195 billion
at the program exchange rate) disbursed on December 10, 2006.
6/ Targets for FY07 are subject to an adjustor depending on the magnitude of net foreign exchange receipts from the Rupali divestment.
7/ Assessed on quarterly basis as indicative targets for September 2005 and December 2005; and as a performance criterion from March 2006. Before July 2006, the target
referred to NBR taxes only.
8/ Adjusted downward by $100 million for September and December 2005 and March 2006, reflecting delay in disbursement of World Bank education sector loan as per TMU
(IMF Country Report No. 05/241).
9/ Performance criteria assessed on a continuous basis under the program period.
10/ The target excludes import-related credits, forward contracts, swaps, other future market contracts, and short-term liabilities by the banking system.
11/ The target excludes credits extended by the Fund and Asian Development Bank, and U.S. Dollar Premium and Investment Bonds purchased by nonresidents.

Safeguards Assessment

Under the Fund’s safeguards assessment policy, the Bangladesh Bank (BB) is subject to a
safeguards assessment with respect to an augmentation of access under the PRGF
Arrangement approved on July 28, 2004. The assessment was completed on January 24, 2005
and concluded that safeguards in place at the BB require further improvement. Weaknesses
were identified in the legal, financial reporting, internal audit and internal control areas, and
the safeguards assessment recommended measures to address them.
VIII. Exchange Arrangement
Exchange regime. The exchange regime is characterized as a managed float with no
preannounced path for the exchange rate. Until end-May 2003, the taka was fixed to the
U.S. dollar, but was periodically adjusted. It was devalued on three occasions during
2000–02, when the trading band for BB’s transactions was correspondingly widened or
raised. From January 2002 until end-May 2003, the official band for the taka remained
unchanged at Tk 57.4–58.4 per U.S. dollar. Authorized dealer (AD) banks set their own
buying and selling rates for the U.S. dollar and other currencies generally within the band
until October 2002. From November 2002, however, AD banks have set rates outside the
band. Effective end-May 2003, BB no longer announced a trading band for its foreign
exchange transactions.
At the last Article IV consultation (June 2005), the Executive Board did not approve the
maintenance of the restriction on the convertibility and transferability of proceeds of current
international transactions in nonresident taka accounts, but noted the authorities’ intent to
remove this restriction by end-June 2006.

APPENDIX II.
BANGLADESH—RELATIONS WITH THE WORLD BANK GROUP1
(As of May 2007)
The World Bank has an expanding assistance program in Bangladesh including investment
and policy-based lending, analytical and advisory services, and lending and non-lending
technical assistance. The Bank also maintains policy dialogue on a broad range of
macroeconomic and sector issues. This annex, however, focuses on Bank activities that are
complementary to those of the Fund.
World Bank-Bangladesh relations and policy dialogue
The Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP) and the IMF and World Bank Joint Staff
Advisory Note were discussed by the World Bank’s Board on January 26, 2006. The PRSP
was completed in October 2005 after a long and broad-based participatory process, building
on the interim PRSP prepared in 2003.
As part of its nonlending services, the Bank has completed key reports. Major reports such as
the Public Expenditure Review and the Poverty Assessment––prepared jointly with the
AsDB––provided inputs for the country’s poverty reduction strategy outlined in the PRSP.
A new Poverty Assessment and an Institutional and Public Expenditure Review are being
prepared this fiscal year. More recently, the Bank completed a review of trade policies in
South Asia, as well as several country-specific reports, including, inter alia: Observance of
Standards and Codes (ROSC), Promoting the Rural Non-Farm Sector in Bangladesh,
Attaining the Millennium Development Goals in Bangladesh, Economics and Governance of
NGOs in Bangladesh, Assessment of Social Safety Nets, End of MFA Quotas: Key Issues and
Strategic Options for Bangladesh Ready Made Garment Industry, and Bangladesh PRSP
Forum Update.
Several key reports are underway in FY07, such as, a Strategy for Growth and Employment,
which will help assess the longer-term growth challenges facing Bangladesh (completed);
and inter alia: a second Investment Climate Assessment, a Rural Finance Study, and the
Dhaka Urban Poverty Study.
Restructuring state-owned enterprises (SOEs). The Bank has engaged in an extensive
dialogue with the authorities on SOE-related issues. A report entitled Bangladesh: Review of
Public Enterprise Performance and Strategy was discussed widely. In response to a request
from the authorities, the Bank provided technical assistance to the Privatization Commission
and assisted it in the preparation of the government’s new Privatization Policy, which has
since been endorsed by Cabinet. Dialogue relating to SOEs in the energy sector has been
1

Prepared by World Bank staff.

6
particularly intensive and the Bank has provided detailed recommendations to the authorities
in areas relating to pricing policy and the regulatory regime for energy and other utilities. As
part of a wide reform program of rolling back state ownership and control within the
economy, the Enterprise Growth and Bank Modernization Project, approved in June 2004, is
supporting restructuring of financial and nonfinancial SOEs. The Bank has also provided
informal advice on improving performance of BIMAN, the national air carrier, and the
government may hire the IFC as an advisor in this regard.
Restructuring the Financial System. The Bank has been actively engaging the authorities
in a dialogue on financial sector reform. Together with the Fund, the Bank co-managed the
Financial Sector Assessment Program report that was prepared in October 2002. With IDA
financing, the government is implementing a program to strengthen the Central Bank. The
mentioned Enterprise Growth and Bank Modernization Project has supported restructuring,
corporatization, and eventual divestment of the nationalized commercial banks, of which
Rupali Bank’s divestment is nearing completion.
Trade Liberalization. In response to requests from the authorities, the Bank has provided
regular analytical support to the government. The Bank-supported Export Diversification
Project included a component designed to build capacity within the Tariff Commission for
tariff analysis and WTO-related negotiations. In addition, the Bank has regularly provided
trade-related policy notes as inputs into the annual budget preparation process. A report was
also completed last year on trade policy regimes in South Asia and another trade study
relating to Bangladesh and India is ongoing. The recently-completed Bangladesh Growth and
Export Competitiveness Study examined key macro- and microeconomic factors affecting
Bangladesh’s competitiveness and provided specific recommendations on priority policy and
institutional actions. Further, the Bank has completed a study on the ready-made garment
sector, End of MFA quotas: Strategic Options for the Bangladesh Ready-Made Garment
Industry. The study identifies several trade-related policy impediments.
Infrastructure Development. Infrastructure development is needed in the country for
economic growth in general, and private sector development in particular. In this context, the
Bank is helping to prepare a power sector strategy, and is supporting Power Sector
Development technical assistance, which includes a project preparation facility, as well as
projects in the areas of municipal services, urban infrastructure, water supply and
telecommunications, and the recently signed railways project.
Strengthening Governance. The Bank has engaged the government in an active dialogue
aimed at improving the investment climate by strengthening accountability and transparency.
The new Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) has governance as its core, building several
analytical reports on the subject. These include an Institutional and Governance Review, a
Country Financial Accountability Assessment, a Country Procurement Assessment, and user
surveys on the quality of service delivery. In addition, the Bank is providing technical
assistance to the government for improving its procurement systems.

7
The Bank is currently preparing a series of policy notes on selected aspects of public
administration and governance, including policy advice to the Ministry of Finance, National
Pay Commission, and the Ministry of Establishment in relation to civil service reform issues,
including compensation policy.
As part of the Bank’s regular public expenditure work, a set of policy notes were completed,
and these will provide inputs to the ongoing Institutional and Public Expenditure Review. A
programmatic approach is being taken to allow better cooperation with other donors. The
unifying theme of the notes is the role of public expenditure on growth and poverty
reduction, aiming to provide inputs for the government to use in their budget preparation
process. As part of the Economic Management Technical Assistance Program, a TA project
for the National Board of Revenue will assist in its capacity building, focusing on
organizational restructuring, human resource management, development of ICT capacity, and
strengthening customs, VAT and income tax administration, and training and research and
statistics. The Bank was also instrumental in the establishment of the Anti-Corruption
Commission (ACC) and continues to support its capacity development.
The World Bank’s Country Assistance Strategy
A results-based Country Assistance Strategy (CAS), prepared jointly with AsDB, DfID, and
JBIC, was discussed by the World Bank’s Board on March 29, 2006. The CAS, covering the
FY06–09 period, is aligned with Bangladesh’s PRSP, with governance as the core focus
across two main pillars: improving the investment climate and empowering the poor. The
CAS aims to address sector governance issues in both pillars, as well as core governance
issues. This mainstreaming of governance implies that all Bank Group interventions will be
as much about governance as they will be about improving sector performance.
The World Bank’s Assistance Program
The Bank has been assisting Bangladesh since FY1973. As of May 2007, the World Bank
Group has approved 204 IDA credits, 4 IDA grants, and 1 IBRD loan for Bangladesh totaling
US$12.1 billion in original commitments. The active portfolio included 25 projects,
representing US$1.78 billion in net commitments and US$1.3 billion in undisbursed funds.
During FY05 and FY06, new commitments totaled US$600 million and US$461.5 million
and disbursements totaled US$695 million and US$556 million, respectively (including
budget support). The Bank is currently supporting projects in key sectors, including social
and human development, rural development, energy and infrastructure, private sector
development, finance, and environment.
In FY05, the Bank approved three IDA credits for a total of US$600 million. These credits
include two policy-based credits and an investment credit prepared within a SWAp
framework. The development policy-based lending includes the second Development
Support Credit (US$200 million) and the Programmatic Education Sector Adjustment Credit
(US$100 million). DSC II continued to support the main themes of the I-PRSP—attaining

8
macroeconomic stability, improving governance, enhancing human development, and
ensuring social protection––and recognized the government’s efforts at implementing broad
reforms in pursuit of the I-PRSP goals. The investment credit was the Health, Nutrition and
Population Sector Program II (US$300 million), which contributes to a sector-wide program
supported by several development partners.
In FY06, the Bank approved four credits for a total of US$461.5 million. Of this amount,
US$300 million correspond to two policy-based credits: Third Development Support Credit
(US$200 million) and Second Programmatic Education Sector Adjustment Credit
(US$100 million). In addition, two investment credits were approved: Local Governance
Support Project (US$111.5 million) and Investment Promotion Finance Facility
(US$50 million).
So far in FY07, the Bank has approved a Railways Project (US$40 million) and a
Development Support Credit IV ($200 million). It is also projected that the Bank will
additionally commit US$175 million in FY07. This amount would include about
US$300 million in budget support, and the rest would support projects in public
procurement, social investment, microfinance, and health (Avian Flu).
As of May 2007, the IFC’s held portfolio stood at US$132.5 million. Of this,
US$102.9 million were under IFC’s own account and US$29.6 million for B-loan
participants. Projects span a range of sectors including power, telecommunications, cement,
and financial markets. No commitments were undertaken in FY05 or FY06. During FY04,
IFC committed US$5 million in a leasing company, ULC, US$40 million to an oil and gas
company, Cairn Energy, to support its expenditure needs in Bangladesh and India; a
US$30 million second investment in GrameenPhone; and as a small equity investment of
US$1.6 million in a local commercial bank, BRAC Bank, focusing on SMEs. In addition, in
FY02, with the support of several donors, IFC started a regional SME technical assistance
facility covering Bangladesh, Bhutan, Nepal, and north-east India.
World Bank-Fund collaboration
The Bank and the Fund have been working closely in Bangladesh, particularly in areas
related to macroeconomic management, financial sector, reform of SOEs, tax policy and
administration, public expenditure management, issues relating to financial accountability,
and in setting up the Financial Intelligence Unit for anti-money laundering and combating
terrorist financing purposes. Bank staff routinely participates in Article IV missions and
provide feedback, as requested, on the macroeconomic framework and other aspects of the
Fund’s macroeconomic dialogue with the authorities. The Bank has also collaborated with
the Fund in several areas related to the Report on Observance of Standards and Codes and
safeguards assessment. Finally, Fund and Bank staff collaborated closely in preparing the
Joint Staff Advisory Note of the PRSP, and in completing the complementary Development
Support Credits and PRGF.

APPENDIX III.
BANGLADESH—RELATIONS WITH THE ASIAN DEVELOPMENT BANK
(As of April 2007)
Lending and technical assistance operations
The Asian Development Bank (AsDB) has assisted Bangladesh since 1973. The cumulative
commitment and disbursement to Bangladesh stood at $8.2 billion and $5.8 billion,
respectively as of end-January 2007. The cumulative outstanding loan as of
end-January 2007 was $4.8 billion. As of end-December 2006, public sector lending was
dominated by four sectors: energy (25 percent), agriculture and natural resources
(20 percent), transport and communications (20 percent), and education (10 percent).
Lending in the other sectors, including finance, health, industry, water supply and sanitation,
and multisector operations remain relatively small, although these sectors have been given
more prominence in recent years. In addition, so far the AsDB has supported seven private
sector projects, valued at $242 million, including the Meghnaghat Power Project, which is
the first build-own-operate power project, and GrameenPhone, which has substantially
expanded access to mobile telecommunications in rural areas.
In 2006, AsDB operations focused on helping remove critical constraints on the investment
climate and on empowering the poor by improving governance in the energy, transport,
education, and integrated urban infrastructure sectors. Energy reforms aimed to help the
government restructure the power sector to ensure adequate and reliable power supply at
competitive prices through increased private sector participation and more effective
management and operations. In the railways, the focus was on improving sector efficiency by
restructuring Bangladesh Railway to make it a market-oriented business organization with
better financial governance, human resources, and operational systems. Successful
implementation of the Secondary Primary Education Development Program, which will
improve the quality of primary education and its accessibility to children from poor
households, is currently under way with AsDB as the lead agency, together with 10 other
development partners.
AsDB approved four projects in 2006 totaling $255.10 million for rural infrastructure
improvement, secondary education, secondary towns water supply and sanitation,
improvement of the capital market, and a multitranche financing facility for the railways
sector (first subloan is $130 million). AsDB also approved seven technical assistance grants
totaling $5.71 million.
Country strategy and program
AsDB’s present Country Strategy and Program (CSP) for Bangladesh for 2006–10 was
approved by the AsDB’s Board on October 31, 2005. The new results-based CSP is part of a

10
joint strategy prepared with the U.K.’s Department for International Development,
Government of Japan, and World Bank. Over its first three years, the CSP proposes loans
totaling about $1.8 billion for 15 projects. This will be supported by a technical assistance
grant program amounting to about $13.8 million.
The CSP is aligned with the vision and priorities of the Bangladesh’s national poverty
reduction strategy, which aims to achieve the MDGs, including halving the number of poor
people in the country by 2015 and delivering substantial improvement in almost all aspects of
human development. The four partners’ joint strategy is built on: (i) improving the
investment climate for private sector-led growth and employment; (ii) advancing the social
development agenda to empower the poor so that all benefit from growth; and (iii) addressing
key governance issues to enable growth and social development.
Under the present country strategy and program, AsDB is playing a major role in energy,
transport, education, and integrated urban development sectors, including urban health and
urban water supply and sanitation. In other areas such as agriculture (i.e., agribusiness), water
resources management, and the financial sector, AsDB is playing a supportive role to
initiatives led by other development partners. Disaster mitigation, regional cooperation,
gender, and environment continue to be addressed as key crosscutting issues.
Economic and sector work program
The AsDB publishes its Asian Development Outlook and its update every year in which it
assesses macroeconomic performance. Beginning in 2001, the AsDB has also prepared
quarterly economic updates. A new bimonthly Economic Indicators Update has been
launched. In support of AsDB’s Country Strategy and Program exercise, several new
thematic assessments and sector studies have been completed. These include: thematic
assessments for poverty, growth and poverty reduction, private sector development,
governance, environment, and gender, and sector studies for transport, information and
communications technology, water resource development, agriculture and rural development,
fisheries, regional cooperation, finance, industry and trade sectors, Dhaka-Chittagong
economic corridor development, and public sector borrowing capacity study. At the request
of the government, a new study has been completed on the economic impact assessment of
the proposed TATA investment in Bangladesh. An analysis of the household income and
expenditure survey of 2005 to estimate income poverty based on new data has been
completed. Several new studies will be undertaken on trade, transport and sectoral issues.

APPENDIX IV.
BANGLADESH—STATISTICAL ISSUES
Macroeconomic data are adequate for surveillance, despite major shortcomings in national
accounts, government finance statistics and balance of payments. Bangladesh is a participant in
the General Data Dissemination System (GDDS), and its metadata have been posted on the
Fund’s Dissemination Standards Bulletin Board since March 2001. A ROSC data module mission
to Bangladesh was undertaken in March 2005. The report is available on the IMF website and
contains the following recommendations that cut across sectors:
•

Legislation should be enacted to define the role of the Bangladesh Bureau of
Statistics (BBS) and to provide it with sufficient powers to fulfill its mandate.

•

Inter-agency cooperation should be improved, particularly for generating data on
bank financing of the government and debt.

•

Advance calendars for the release of data should be established, disseminated, and
observed.

•

The BBS should increasingly use its website to disseminate data and metadata in addition
to paper publication. This would also ensure simultaneous data release to all users.

National accounts
The weakness of source data remains the primary deficiency. The BBS does not conduct an
annual national accounts survey of business enterprises and source data are primarily from
benchmark surveys, a census of manufacturing establishments conducted every two years,
and biannual household expenditure surveys. Many of the benchmark surveys were
conducted over five years ago and are based on outdated sample frames. The 2005 ROSC
mission recommended that the BBS establish and maintain a business register for all
economic units as a basis for surveys, which should be conducted annually.
The deficiencies in the data also affect compilation practices. There is heavy reliance on the
use of fixed input-output ratios in estimating current value added. Thus estimates do not
always reflect the rapid change in the structure of some industries. In addition, the use of
inappropriate deflators and deflation techniques may undermine the reliability of the constant
price estimates for some industries. A system of price indices for estimating national
accounts at constant prices needs to be developed.
Bangladesh lacks quarterly estimates of GDP, but the compilation of quarterly national
accounts, with technical assistance from the AsDB, is included in the authorities’ GDDS
plans for improvement. However, given resource constraints, improving the sources and

12
methodology for annual data should be a short-term priority. Improvement in data sources
should pave the way for the compilation of advance indicators of economic activity.
Prices, wages, and employment
Price statistics include a consumer price index (CPI), a producer price index (PPI), a
wholesale price index (WPI), and unit value indices for external trade. The CPI and WPI are
published with lags of two and three months, respectively, while unit value indices of exports
and imports are available on an annual basis. The CPI and PPI weights are outdated, and the
2005 ROSC mission reiterated that the CPI should be compiled using weights derived from a
household and expenditure survey completed in 2002.
Data for wages are prepared monthly, but employment and unemployment data are only
available at irregular intervals.
Government finance and debt
The government finance statistics (GFS) continue to be affected by major shortcomings.
There are large (but recently reduced) suspense accounts that are not always cleared at the
end of the fiscal year, which impedes the classification of data by economic use and function.
Foreign financed development expenditure is substantially understated due to reporting
weaknesses. Three nonfinancial public enterprises—the railway, the postal office, and
telephone and telegraph office—are included in central government budgetary accounts.
Some subsidy items are classified as net lending.
Until recently, the Ministry of Finance had made no systematic attempt to compile
comprehensive debt statistics, but instead relied on a variety of sources for these records. A
Debt Management Wing was established within the Finance Division for this purpose. The
ROSC mission recommended that this unit also include comprehensive data on governmentguaranteed debt in its debt statistics. External debt stock data by creditor are available with a
lag of about 8 to 12 months, and the authorities do not have an automated system for external
debt projections.
Annual data on the government’s external financing for the budget and foreign grants are
available with a lag of nine months. Domestic financing data provided by the National
Savings Directorate with a lag of six weeks, were found to have serious shortcomings.
Efforts continue to improve the quality and timeliness of the external financing data, which
remains weak.
Although annual GFS data through the fiscal year ending June 30, 2004 were provided by the
authorities for inclusion in the Government Finance Statistics Yearbook, the coverage of the
data was limited to budgetary central government, because no data are collected on local

13
governments. No quarterly or monthly data are reported to the IFS. During the GFS mission
in January/February 2004, the authorities adopted a proposed migration plan to implement
the GFSM 2001.
Monetary accounts
Monthly accounts of the Bangladesh Bank (BB) and other depository corporations are
available with a lag of six weeks. In addition, BB also produces a weekly publication (shared
with the Fund) that is available with a lag of about five to six weeks. In line with earlier Fund
recommendations, BB is reporting its monetary accounts to the Fund electronically. Several
of the ROSC mission recommendations were put into practice, including recording on an
accrual basis the interest earned on BB’s special treasury bills and recording of overdrafts as
loans rather than netting them out with deposits. BB has embarked on a project to adapt the
monetary statistics with the methodology of the Monetary and Financial Statistics Manual
and has reported test data using the standardized report forms (SRFs), introduced in October
2004. These data are being reviewed by STA and will be published in the IFS Supplement on
Monetary and Financial Statistics when they are finalized. BB has also expressed a strong
interest in establishing an integrated database that links monetary statistics to accounting
records and yields alternative, transparent, and consistent presentations of monetary statistics
for different users.
Balance of payments
Balance of payments data are broadly on the basis of the Fifth Edition of the Balance of
Payments Manual (BPM5). Apart from export shipments data, most other statistics are
recorded on a cash basis, with the banking and exchange control records as the primary
source of data. The foreign direct investment data are derived from enterprise surveys.
Summary balance of payments (BOP) data are compiled and disseminated on a monthly
basis; quarterly statistics for all the major accounts are consistent with monthly data; and
annual BOP data are presented with a detailed classification. Data sources for estimating
goods for processing—a significant component of the BOP—are not adequate, and respective
adjustments to goods imports and exports are not available. Nontrade activities of companies
operating in the export processing zones are included; however, the financial transactions of
offshore banks are not. Data on private sector external borrowing, the transactions of foreign
direct investors, and workers’ remittances through the informal hundi banking system are not
fully incorporated in the official published data. Official foreign direct investments may not
be fully reported. Data on income and transfers are incomplete. Data on suppliers’ credit to
the government are available on a monthly basis with a three-month lag, but are not
comprehensive.

Statement by the IMF Staff Representative
June 22, 2007

1.
This statement provides information that has become available since the circulation of
the staff report. It does not alter the thrust of the staff appraisal.
2.
Inflation rose further but external indicators remain strong. Reflecting the impact
of fuel price adjustments, April inflation rose to 8.3 percent (y/y), consistent with staff’s
FY07 average annual inflation projection of 7.2 percent. Broad money and credit growth
moderated somewhat in April in line with staff projections. Buoyant exports and remittance
flows were sustained in April and May, and gross official reserves reached $4.8 billion as of
mid-June, while the taka continues to hover around 69 per U.S. dollar.
3.
A preliminary FY08 budget was presented on June 7. While the revenue target is
fully consistent with staff’s projection of 10.7 percent of GDP, current expenditures are
higher by 0.4 percent of GDP and are expected to be financed by more foreign grants, based
on updated donor commitments. The main base broadening measure is the extension of VAT
to previously exempt services. The budget

two-week period of public comment, the
budget is to be finalized and submitted for
cabinet approval in late June. In implementing the FY08 budget, the authorities will need to
be prepared to adjust spending plans if the assumed higher foreign financing does not
materialize so that domestic financing remains within budget limits.
4.
Several trade taxes were modified in the budget. A 4 percent surcharge on imports
(earmarked for infrastructure development) was consolidated into the tariff system, two
supplementary duty rates were merged, and a number of goods were removed from the zero
tariff band as part of a reform of the import tariff regime that aims to be revenue neutral. At
the same time, an export withholding tax of 0.25 percent was introduced. These changes have
reduced tariff dispersion by consolidating some charges and may help reduce evasion by

2
removing many goods from the zero rate tariff band, but have had no significant impact on
average levels of protection.
5.
The FY08 budget does not resolve the main issues emphasized in the staff report,
particularly regarding the need for timely adjustment of administered prices and
fundamental revenue reform. Timely price adjustment would restrain subsidies and
transfers and avoid the need to assume nonperforming loans of loss-making SOEs in the
future. The revenue policies announced with the budget should be sufficient to produce the
modest improvement in revenue forecast for FY08, but the significant improvement in
revenue necessary to meet development objectives over the medium term would require more
comprehensive reform as outlined in the staff report. In this regard, the staff welcomes the
authorities’ disclosure in the budget speech that initiation of such comprehensive revenue
system reform is under consideration.
6.
Tax administration reforms also need to be accelerated. With the exception of a
proposed introduction of a universal self assessment scheme to encourage voluntary tax
compliance, the budget speech did not reveal additional tax administration reforms, such as
the needed consolidation of the two large taxpayer units (LTUs) or separation of the tax
policy and administration functions. However, the process of assigning a unique
identification number for taxpayers in the LTUs (a structural performance criterion for endMarch under the PRGF-supported program) was completed at end-May.
7.
Further financial sector reforms are under way, but the sale of Rupali Bank is
still pending. Several measures were announced with the budget that will support further
development of a secondary market for government debt instruments, including the
elimination of the upfront tax on government bond sales and plans to increase the use of
yield-based auctions and longer-term bonds. Corporatization of the three NCBs was
completed in early June and the government has advertised positions for new managers.
Bangladesh Bank raised the banks’ minimum capital adequacy ratio from 9 to 10 percent of
risk-weighted assets as of end-2007, as part of steps to further strengthen prudential
regulations. In recognition of positive steps taken to strengthen its surveillance institutions,
Bangladesh was recently invited to join the Egmont Group of financial intelligence units that
combat money laundering and terrorist financing. With respect to Rupali Bank, there are no
signs of when the preferred bidder, who was announced at end-August 2006, might conclude
the purchase.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

International Monetary Fund

Washington, D. C. 20431 USA

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2007 Article IV Consultation with
Bangladesh
On June 22, 2007, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF)
concluded the Article IV consultation with Bangladesh.1
Background
Bangladesh’s growth outlook and external position remain robust, but inflation has
picked up. The economy continued to grow at over 6½ percent in the fiscal year ending
June 2006 (FY06) spurred by strong exports and investment. GDP growth is expected
to continue at around 6½ percent in FY07 despite some supply-related disruptions, with
lower agricultural growth offset by strong manufacturing and service activities. Inflation
has recently picked up to over 7 percent reflecting increases in both food and nonfood
prices.
The exchange rate has been relatively stable and international reserves have increased
throughout the period of political upheaval. Reserves have reached beyond US$4 billion
(approaching three months of imports) on the back of continued strong remittances and
exports, which are growing at 25 and 21 percent, respectively.
Overall macroeconomic stability has been maintained, but fiscal performance continues
to suffer from structural weaknesses. Revenue performance has consistently been
1

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies.
On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion
by the Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as
Chairman of the Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is
transmitted to the country's authorities.

2
below budget targets. In addition, spending accelerated early in FY07 causing a surge in
domestic financing of the government while delays in external disbursements further
aggravated the situation. This forced expenditure cuts later in the year to contain the
overall deficit and domestic financing. As a result, development expenditure was
significantly underexecuted.
The growth in monetary and credit aggregates increased considerably in FY07. Broad
money growth reached a high of 22 percent in December and private credit growth has
been close to 20 percent for much of the year. Reflecting better control of government
finances since January 2007, the growth in monetary aggregates has declined
somewhat, but still remains above targeted levels. With ample liquidity, bank lending
and deposit interest rates have seen only modest increases.
Petroleum prices have not kept pace with international prices leading to a deterioration
of finances of state-owned enterprises. After the April fuel price adjustments, domestic
prices of diesel and kerosene are around 80 percent of their breakeven level and below
prices in neighboring countries. The losses accumulated in the past have been financed
through loans from the nationalized commercial banks, and about two-thirds of these
loans are overdue contributing to the weak financial health of these banks.
The Bangladesh Bank has further advanced reforms aimed at deepening financial
markets. The regulatory framework has been strengthened, off-site and on-site
supervision has been enhanced and steps taken to restructure, corporatize, and
privatize the large nationalized commercial banks. These reforms have contributed to
reducing the share of the large nationalized banks and strengthening the banking
system. However, interest rate spreads are high and point to inefficiencies in the
domestic banking system that detract from efficient financial intermediation.
The current transitional government has moved to address several areas where reforms
had stalled. These include adjustments in fuel and electricity prices, introduction of a
Financial Intelligence Unit, reconstituting the Anti-Corruption Commission, and
separating the judiciary from the executive branch.
Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors welcomed that macroeconomic stability with strong growth has been
maintained for several years, and that most of the objectives of the Poverty Reduction
and Growth Facility-supported program were achieved. Inflation was largely contained,
poverty has been reduced, and good progress has been made toward achieving the
Millennium Development Goals. The shift to a flexible exchange rate strengthened the
external sector, helping to support double-digit growth in exports and remittances and a
significant improvement in international reserves. Although fiscal discipline was
maintained, revenues fell short. Looking forward, growth is expected to remain healthy,
underpinned by buoyant exports, strong remittance flows, and continued reform efforts.
At the same time, weak revenue collections, poor infrastructure, low skill levels, and
governance issues remain important impediments to sustained growth and further
poverty reduction.

3

Directors observed that revenue collections are insufficient to meet development needs
or to support the desired reductions in tariffs and supplementary duties. They called for
a fundamental reform of the tax system by broadening the tax base, separating the
responsibility for tax policy and collection, simplifying VAT and income tax legislation,
and consolidating and strengthening the institutional structure of tax administration.
Directors welcomed the recent steps to consolidate import taxes, but observed that the
rate of effective protection remains high.
Directors welcomed the planned reforms in the area of public financial management and
the adoption by major ministries of the medium-term budget framework, but drew
attention to the underexecution of development spending. They hoped that the adoption
of a regulatory framework for the Public Procurement Act would raise the efficiency of
project implementation.
Directors supported the authorities’ efforts to stem state-owned enterprise losses and
ease infrastructure bottlenecks. They welcomed the fuel price adjustments by the stateowned petroleum company, but called for more timely adjustments through an automatic
pricing formula. Directors recommended adjusting the price of domestically produced
natural gas to encourage efficient gas usage and raise government revenue.
Directors commended the authorities for their progress in strengthening central bank
operations and improving the institutional framework for monetary policy, and the steps
taken to develop a secondary market for government securities. They recommended
further monetary tightening in the face of strong inflows and higher inflation, and with
money and credit aggregates above targeted levels. The recent pickup in inflation could
become entrenched in the absence of corrective policies.
Directors considered that the flexible exchange rate regime has helped maintain
competitiveness, and remains appropriate. With reserves now at a more comfortable
level, exchange market intervention should be confined to alleviating disorderly
conditions, and thus allowing greater flexibility in the nominal rate to support stabilization
objectives. Directors urged the authorities to remove the remaining exchange restriction
on the transferability of funds in nonresident taka accounts.
Directors commended the authorities for improving financial sector surveillance, and
recommended that they build on recent financial sector reforms. They welcomed the
corporatization of the remaining state-owned banks, hoped for a successful privatization
of Rupali Bank, and encouraged the authorities to prepare the other state banks for
eventual divestment. Directors called on the authorities to bring banking sector
prudential guidelines more in line with international standards and strengthen
monitoring, particularly in the context of rapid credit growth. Directors commended the
authorities for implementing many of the recommendations of the 2003 Financial Sector
Assessment Program (FSAP), and welcomed the authorities’ request for an FSAP
update.
Directors supported the recent reforms to promote transparency, good governance in
public administration, fair elections, and the prevention of money laundering and terrorist

4
financing. These reforms, if sustained, will improve overall efficiency and boost the
investment climate.
Directors noted that data are broadly adequate for surveillance purposes, but called for
continued efforts to improve data quality, including banking soundness indicators, and
national accounts, fiscal and debt statistics.
Directors looked forward to continued close cooperation and dialogue between the
authorities and the staff in support of Bangladesh’s reform objectives, possibly in the
context of a Fund-supported program.
Public Information Notices (PINs) form part of the IMF's efforts to promote transparency of the IMF's
views and analysis of economic developments and policies. With the consent of the country
(or countries) concerned, PINs are issued after Executive Board discussions of Article IV consultations
with member countries, of its surveillance of developments at the regional level, of post-program
monitoring, and of ex post assessments of member countries with longer-term program engagements.
PINs are also issued after Executive Board discussions of general policy matters, unless otherwise
decided by the Executive Board in a particular case.

Statement by Adarsh Kishore, Executive Director for Bangladesh
and R. Bannerji, Senior Advisor to Executive Director
June 22, 2007
1. Introduction:
1.1 The Bangladesh Authorities take this opportunity to place on record their thanks and
appreciation to IMF staff for the Article IV Consultation and the Sixth PRGF Review
mission conducted in April 2007. The Authorities are in broad agreement with the
observations, recommendations and the policy advice on macro-economic and structural
reforms covered in the Staff Report.
1.2
Since November 2006, the already vitiated political situation in Bangladesh began to
worsen, and by January 2007, assumed dangerous proportions. The street riots, violent
hartals and blockades brought economic and social life to a virtual standstill. To put an end
to the destabilizing political situation, the President declared Emergency on January 11, 2007
and formed a new Caretaker Government (CTG), the major responsibility of which, inter
alia, is to create a congenial environment to conduct a free and fair election expeditiously
and in a transparent manner. The new CTG has come down heavily against corruption. A
number of studies in recent years have determined that corruption in Bangladesh consumes
1-2 percent of GDP. In order to pursue cases against corrupt individuals, the Judiciary and
Anti-Corruption Commission have been strengthened and more court houses are being set up
to enable quick disposal of the growing number of cases.
1.3 In spite of the difficult political situation, Bangladesh economy has made remarkable
progress buttressed by wide-ranging reforms supported by the World Bank Development
Support Credit (DSC), Poverty Reduction Growth Facility (PRGF) of IMF and
DFID-supported Financial Management Reform Programme. Strong growth and
well-designed policies to attack poverty during the last decade seemed to have paid dividends
as revealed in the recent Household Income and Expenditure Survey (HIES). The proportion
of people living in poverty fell from 49 percent in 2000 to 40 percent, with the hardcore
poverty falling from 34 percent to 25 percent. In FY 2005-06, economic growth posted a
historic high rate of 6.7 percent, thanks to the robust growth of both agriculture and industry.
Bangladesh continues to post current account surpluses reflecting strong growth of export
and remittance inflows. Gross reserves, at over $ 4 billion are comfortable.
1.4 The Government of Bangladesh remains fully committed to the earnest pursuit of
reforms despite some difficult domestic and external circumstances. Some of the reform
measures implemented in recent times include adjustment of oil prices, rationalization of
electricity tariff, corporatization of national commercial banks, reconstitution of Election
Commission, Anti-Corruption Commission. These reforms are the building blocks for faster
growth to reduce poverty, and thereby improve the welfare of the people. Bangladesh’s
development and poverty reduction strategy is enshrined in the document named “Unlocking
the Potential: National Strategy for Accelerated Poverty Reduction (NSAPR)". The budgets
are formulated in consonance with the overarching framework of NSAPR, and their effective
implementation is aided by Medium-term Budget Framework (MTBF), that has now been
extended to14 important ministries that spend 60 percent of the total budget.

Budget Highlights
2.1 The recently announced national budget has set out the major policy directions of the
new CTG. The FY 2007-08 budget includes: emphasis on maintaining a favorable macro
economic environment; rationalization of the trade regime; decisive steps to assume SOE
liabilities, principally of Bangladesh Petroleum Corporation and Power Development Board;
significantly higher allocation in strategic sectors of power and agriculture, including a
provision for diesel subsidy to poor farmers facing higher irrigation cost. Safety net
programmes have been deepened and widened and new programs added with more focused
targeting. The Authorities have reconstituted the hitherto ineffective Anti-Corruption
Commission and further demonstrated their commitment to elimination of corruption by
signing UN Convention against Corruption. The judiciary has been separated from the
executive organ. Human resource development constitutes 25 percent of the total budget
allocation with education and health receiving 15.2 percent and 7 percent respectively. A
Universal Self-Assessment Procedure of tax return has been introduced. The tariff structure
has been simplified and the tariff distortion brought to a minimum. The trade regime has
been further liberalized. Both the VAT net and Income-tax net have been widened.
Government borrowings from ad hoc treasury bills have been replaced by transparent auction
based system.
2.2 In the absence of a working parliament in the country, the Government has ensured an
extensive consultative process involving former finance ministers, finance secretaries,
intelligentsia, civil society, non-government organizations, journalists, and people at large
both before and after the announcement of the budget. Following the declaration of the
budget, the government allowed 10 days for receiving suggestions, ideas and comments from
individuals, groups and institutions. All such inputs are currently being processed and the
ones determined as having merit would be considered before final approval.
2.3 In the coming fiscal year, the Government has attached the highest importance to the
implementation of the budget. To this end the Finance Ministry is mobilizing its manpower
and resources for monitoring the implementation of budget. The Authorities put special
allocation of resources to in major ministries that cover the key sectors to conduct
special/performance audit, with the work to be outsourced to private sector audit firms of
good standing. The Finance Division has introduced an Internal Control Manual to be
uniformly applied in relation to public expenditure to all ministries / divisions and
departments under them.
3.
Macro-economic Stability
3.1 Propelled by higher growth in industrial and service sectors, the overall economic
growth in FY 2006-07 is likely to be around 6.5 percent despite the political turmoil and
hartals and poor weather for key rice crops. Export and remittance have been the bulwark of
growth recording 19 percent and 27 percent respectively in the three quarters of this fiscal
year. Credit to the private sector grew at an annualized rate of 19 percent during the same
period. The domestic investment looked robust with 21 percent growth in LC settlement for
capital machinery.

3
3.2 Inflation, however, appears in the horizon as a major concern averaging 7 percent. The
Bangladesh Bank is closely watching the situation and will exercise appropriate monetary
policy option to contain inflation. The Authorities are aware that inflation hurts people,
particularly the poor. It undermines economic stability and discourages investment; it deters
growth and widens income inequality. To rein in inflation, the Government withdrew import
duty on a number of items including rice and wheat. Bangladesh Bank has instructed
commercial banks to encourage larger number of new importers of food to bring about
greater competition. National Task Force and Task Forces in district and sub-district level
regularly monitor the prices of essential commodities including a group devoted to the
analysis of the prices. Government is to double its import of rice and wheat.
3.3 Cautious monetary policy has been matched by prudent fiscal policy. The overall fiscal
deficit in FY 06 was kept below the target despite revenue shortfall. Our revenue to GDP
ratio remains phenomenally low with 10.5 percent. The Annual Development Programme
fell short in terms of implementation by about 20 percent due to resource inadequacy and
implementation capacity constraints. For maintaining macro-economic stability, keeping
public debt at a sustainable level and avoiding any crowding out impact on the private sector,
the Government has limited domestic borrowing to 2 percent of the GDP in line with staff
suggestions and prudential borrowing practice.
3.4 Of late, there has been growing interest from overseas investors for large scale foreign
direct investment (FDI) in Bangladesh. The growth of FDI in Bangladesh averaged 16
percent from 2002 to 2007. Very recently, the Mittal Group, the steel conglomerate, signed a
Memorandum of Understanding with Board of Investment for investing US$ 2.8 billion in
coal, steel and power industries.
4. Structural and Institutional Reforms:
4.1 The commitment of the CTG to structural and institutional reforms has been
demonstrated through several bold measures during the last 5 months. The reforms cover the
financial sector, state-owned enterprises, the power and energy sector, telecommunications,
fiscal policy and broad governance issues.
4.2 Three Nationalized Commercial Banks (NCBs) are about to be converted into public
limited companies to enable them to operate like private banks. From January 2007,
Authorities made it mandatory to have all commercial banks credit rated, and updated
annually by a Credit Rating Company of good reputation to safeguard interest of the
depositors and prospective investors. Reforms in insurance laws relating to protection of
policy holders and supervision of insurance business are in process. To ensure international
accounting, auditing and reporting standards, a Financial Reporting Act has been approved
by the Council of Advisors. Money Laundering Prevention Act has been made more effective
to prevent illegal transfer of funds.
4.3 In next fiscal year, more shares of SOEs and Government's share in commercial banks
will be off-loaded in the Stock exchange. The listing of the new SOEs and the sale of bank
shares is expected to bring about further vibrancy in the capital market which has grown
significantly over the last three years. The Government is encouraging the private

4
conglomerates and the mobile phone companies to raise capital from the market. The
implementation of these steps will widen and deepen the capital market.
4.4 Despite the Government’s flexibility in the divestment of Rupali Bank, the process has
got stalled owing to frequent shifts in stance by the highest bidder. The Bangladesh
Government has, time and again, acceded to the request of the bidder, and the present
delaying tactics by the bidder has placed the Authorities in an embarrassing situation.
4.5 The revised FY 07 budget, the Government has allocated Taka 15 billion to make the
quasi-fiscal costs of the Government more transparent. In FY 2007-08, the Government will
assume the total liabilities of Bangladesh Petroleum Corporation (BPC), in the amount of
Taka 75 billion arising out of administered fuel price over the past few years. BPC is being
geared up to run on a commercial basis and will be allowed to adjust petroleum prices on a
previously agreed automatic price adjustment formula.
4.6 One of the biggest challenges facing the CTG is tackling the power crisis, a legacy that
will continue to affect the economy for at least 3 more years. We have made highest
allocation increase of 51 percent in power sector and the Government is building quite a few
more power plants. Private sector power producers are also encouraged. Power has been
identified as a thrust sector and Bangladesh would appeal for larger soft-term loan for
investment in this sector from development partners. In the other strategic transportation
sector, reforms in the seaports of Chittagong and Mongla led to a reduction of ship
turnaround time from 9 days to 4 days with handling costs cut down by 20 percent. Low
revenue collection remains a fundamental problem in fiscal management for the Government.
Revenue as a share of GDP continues to be stagnant coasting around 10.5 percent. The
Authorities have identified this low revenue growth as the main challenge in the fiscal front.
The Government has expressed their broad agreement with the April 2007 IMF Staff Report
suggesting overhaul of tax legislation and separation of revenue collection from policymaking.
5.
PRGF Programme
5.1 At the conclusion of this statement on behalf of my Authorities I wish to state that the
PRGF engagement with the IMF during the past 4 years, along with budgetary support from
the World Bank through DSCs, has been largely successful. A flexible exchange rate regime
was introduced in 2003, discreetly timed and executed, without creating any turbulence in the
market. GDP growth has been impressive sustained over the programme years, there has
been sustained reduction of poverty and progress in several MDG targets. Several key
structural reforms have been implemented. Price adjustments in fuel, gas and power have
significantly reduced hidden quasi-fiscal costs of the Government. The corporatization of the
NCBs, the issuance of unique taxpayer identification numbers to large tax payers, and the
establishment of Large Taxpayers' Units, are examples of some significant reforms in the
financial / fiscal sectors. However, the tax to GDP ratio remains stagnant. You will
appreciate that this has been largely due to revenue loss owing to liberalization of
international trade regime. The Programme target of an increment of 1.5 percent in revenue
to GDP ratio during the period could not be met.

5
5.2 Post PRGF :
Our Authorities concur with the broad gist of the Staff report and are prepared to go forward
in: (a) initiating a detailed overview of the current tax legislation through a possible
Technical Assistance package from the Fund. This would be with a view to streamlining
existing legislation and plugging loopholes existing at present; (b) combining the two Large
Tax Payers’ Units (LTUs) and issuing Unique Tax Identification Numbers (UTINs) to all
large taxpayers; (c) separating aspects of Tax policy and planning away from administration
of tax collection. Our Authorities feel that these steps are indeed necessary for tax
buoyancies to improve in the long run.
5.3 The CTG is committed to change. The CTG has in the last 5 months brought in more
fundamental and institutional reforms than what was witnessed in the past several years. An
Independent Election Commission for holding a free and fair election by end 2008,
anti-corruption drive through Anti-Corruption Commission, banking and financial sector
reforms are some of the major icons.
5.4. Many more important reforms will be forthcoming in the coming months. My
Authorities' goal is to establish the conditions for sustainable and long-lasting reforms that
are oriented to the welfare of the people, enhance efficiency and improve growth
performance. The Government has weighed the three options provided in Staff Report for
future engagement with the Fund and have resolved to pursue negotiation for a new PRGF.
