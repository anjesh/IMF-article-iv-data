Executive Summary
Germany is benefiting from a cyclical upswing. Buoyant world demand has propelled
exports, which have at last triggered a rebound in investment and an uptick in employment.
The private sector’s sustained restructuring and wage moderation have underpinned this
progress. The fiscal deficit has been reduced and important reforms have been implemented
to improve the functioning of labor markets and reduce the cost of entitlement programs.
However, Germany still has a highly regulated economy that is financing a generous welfare
state. These rigidities make it more difficult to deal with shocks, including the forces of
globalization and aging. Policies need to address three interrelated challenges:
•
Low trend growth, with lackluster productivity improvements in the more sheltered
domestic (services) sectors.
•
High and long-lasting unemployment, with high reservation wages limiting job
opportunities for the poor and lower skilled.
•

Risks to long-run fiscal sustainability despite commendable progress in recent years.

Considerable headway can be made in tackling these challenges if Germany takes
advantage of the upswing to implement the following mutually-reinforcing policies:
•
Labor market reforms need to be reinvigorated to reduce structural unemployment.
Benefits for the long-term unemployed should be reduced for those unwilling to work. New
distortions such as sectoral minimum wages, selective wage subsidies, and tighter regulation
of temporary work agencies should not be introduced. Ineffective active labor market
programs should be culled.
•
Product market reforms should aim to increase competition and enhance
productivity. Contestability of markets in network industries should be improved by stepping
up privatization and reducing access costs. Liberal professions and the guild system should
be deregulated to lower the power of incumbents.
•
Capital markets and the financial sector need to be made more dynamic and
efficient to improve the allocation of capital. Efforts to improve the effectiveness of
legislation for private equity and to establish REITs that include both residential and
nonresidential property should be pursued with vigor. Public sector banks should be opened
up more to private capital to facilitate market driven restructuring and improve profitability.
•
Fiscal policies should aim to achieve structural balance by 2010 and further improve
long-term sustainability. A sizeable reduction of the deficit is in train for 2005-2007, but
after that additional high-quality measures need to be implemented to continue lowering the
deficit. Health care reforms should strive to reduce the burden on payroll taxes, increase
competition, and lower costs. The corporate income tax reform should be designed to avoid
new budgetary burdens or distortions for firms.

I. INTRODUCTION
1.
After protracted weakness in domestic demand, a strong and gradually
broadening cyclical recovery is finally underway (Table 1, Figure 1). Fast export growth
and record profits in the corporate sector, resulting in large part from steady business
restructuring and the favorable external environment, have at last rekindled investment
demand. Construction is also beginning to turn around. However, with continued wage
moderation, consumption remains tepid despite an uptick in employment.
2.
Far-reaching adjustment of the private and public sectors have supported strong
exports but held back domestic demand.1

The domestic economy—with high labor
costs and structural rigidities—lacked the
dynamism to absorb surplus labor. The
bust in the large construction sector,
following a unification-related boom,
exacerbated the decline in employment.

Depressed property markets and the

entitlement reforms and restrain spending to improve fiscal solvency. These belt
tightening efforts induced households to step up precautionary savings, which slowed
consumption.
3.
Overall, adjustment in recent years has centered on wage moderation and fiscal
containment, rather than efficiency-enhancing structural reforms (Box 1). The current
government has put priority on four areas: fiscal consolidation, business tax and health care
reform, and making labor markets more flexible. It is too early to say whether a major
turnaround will be achieved, because all the measures in these four areas have not yet been
announced.

Box 1. Past Fund Policy Recommendations and Implementation
In past consultations, Directors called for comprehensive and mutually reinforcing policies to achieve
fiscal sustainability and reduce structural rigidities to meet the challenges of globalization and aging.
Fiscal consolidation. Directors endorsed the authorities’ policies to reduce the fiscal deficit below
3 percent of GDP by 2007, with some Directors calling for frontloading of adjustment and greater
reliance on expenditure reduction. In the event, the deficit will be reduced to well below 3 percent in
2006. The structural adjustment of over 1 percent of GDP in 2006-07 is spread more evenly than was
thought earlier, and has a significant expenditure component.
Fiscal reforms. Directors called for medium-term fiscal consolidation to enhance the sustainability of
public finances. Consistent with Directors’ recommendations, a first round of fiscal federalism
reforms has been adopted to streamline the legislative process and give Länder more autonomy. More
fundamental changes in intergovernmental financial relations are yet to be addressed.
Labor and entitlement reforms. Directors welcomed the Hartz labor market reforms but their
effectiveness has been hampered by design flaws and weak implementation. There has been no
progress in reforming employment protection legislation. Directors also saw a need for further
recalibrating the entitlement system, and the decision to gradually raise the pension age remains to be
enacted in law.
Productivity-enhancing reforms. Reforms in product and service markets have proceeded slowly. In
the banking system, private investors have been recently allowed to buy shares in one Landesbank,
but overall structural efficiency gains have been slim.

2006 by ¼–½ percentage points (and lower it by the same amount in 2007). Real growth is
projected to rise to 2.3 percent in 2006 (from 0.9 percent in 2005), with nearly three-quarters
of the contribution to growth coming from domestic demand.

II. THE CURRENT SETTING

5.
Job growth has only recently started to turn around and overall consumption
has remained subdued. Full time employment has picked up for the first time in five years
but the unemployment rate still stands at 10.6 percent in the national definition (8.2 in the
ILO definition). The unemployment rate remains particularly high in East Germany at over
16 percent (national definition), where productivity is lower and adjustment has been
hindered by large income transfers. Further, although wage costs have fallen, especially in
manufacturing, they remain high in international comparison (Figure 3), resulting in
continued wage moderation. Spending power has also been held back by terms of trade
losses.
6.
External competitiveness is strong but restructuring of domestically-oriented
sectors is lagging (Box 2, Figure 4). Germany’s large exporting companies operate globally,
including by moving production capacity abroad and purchasing intermediate inputs from
foreign suppliers, and have become less dependent on their home market. This has brought
strong export penetration and market share gains both in advanced and emerging market

reservation wages for low-skilled labor, and regulations that tend to favor incumbents.

Box 2. Competitiveness and External Position
German companies are competitive. Germany is the only G7 country that has gained overall market
share in world exports in recent years, even during periods of euro appreciation.
Labor shedding and wage moderation have lowered unit labor costs and the current level of the
real exchange rate is broadly in line with fundamentals: various analytical approaches suggest only a
small undervaluation in the range of 3 to 6 percent, as calculated by Fund staff using equilibrium
exchange rate models, and by the Bundesbank using an indicator of trade deflators against nineteen
trading partners. At the same time, research suggests that strong foreign growth has been an even
more important factor than cost reduction in boosting German exports. And, Germany’s strength in
engineering products has allowed firms to benefit from the global investment cycle.
The rise in Germany’s external current account surplus to an average of 4 percent of GDP in
2000-05 largely reflected a sharp reduction in domestic investment, both by nonfinancial
enterprises and households. During this period business firms repaired their balance sheets by cutting
investment and increasing saving. Residential household investment was weak as disposable incomes
faltered and households picked up their saving in anticipation of aging amidst uncertainty about
future entitlement income. The household saving ratio is expected to fall in the course of 2006 with
advance purchases prior to the VAT increase. And, as the domestic investment cycle is now turning,
business net saving is also expected to drop. The public sector, however, is projected to increase its
saving to bolster its balance sheet.

GDP growth to slow to 1.4 percent in 2007, but because growth in 2006 has been boosted by
various one-time effects this does not reflect a slowing of underlying growth, which is
estimated to be between 1½-1¾ percent for the two years. Inflation is expected to rise from
1.7 percent in 2006 to 2.3 percent in 2007, with a jump in early 2007 again reflecting the
VAT (Figure 4). Wage demands for 2007 are picking up due to strong corporate profitability
and the VAT increase, but core inflation is projected to remain between 1-1½ percent.
9.
Risks to the recovery are balanced but the range of forecasts for 2007 is
unusually wide. Downside risks stem from volatile oil prices and geopolitics, and an
unexpected tightening of euro-area monetary policy. A disorderly unwinding of global
imbalances could result in a sharp euro appreciation and lower growth. Faster-than-expected

10.
Absent a stronger push for structural reforms, the improved cyclical prospects
do not change Germany’s low growth potential over the long term. In the medium run,
the staff projects the recovery of domestic demand to close the output gap by 2008 and the
external current account surplus to fall (Table 2). Recovering from its drawn-out adjustment,
domestic demand is expected to rebound as consumption, investment, and total factor
productivity recover to their longer run steady states. In the long run, however, Germany’s
slowing demographics are expected to reduce potential growth to just over 1 percent a year,
although progress in labor, product, financial sector and (CIT) tax reforms could improve
this outlook. If policies are successful in raising labor utilization and in bringing
unemployment down, growth could speed up for some years, but eventually the declining
population would constrain headline growth. Long-run per capita growth would be in the
range of 1½-1¾ percent a year, in line with other advanced countries.

IV. POLICY DISCUSSIONS
11.
The priority for Germany is to transmit its external strength to the domestic
economy, thus further broadening the recovery and creating conditions for sustained
high growth. This requires policies that improve the efficiency of domestic markets and
place near-term challenges in a long-run context. Such a strategy should exploit three
mutually reinforcing elements: (i) improving labor market flexibility and bolstering
employment to boost household income and domestic demand; (ii) raising productivity in
product and financial markets; and (iii) reforming entitlements and adjusting fiscal policies to
strengthen confidence in the sustainability of the welfare state.
12.
The political environment is challenging and the partners in the grand coalition
are having difficulty agreeing on substantial reforms. The coalition partners have taken a
decisive stance on fiscal adjustment, but they are not natural allies on reforms—the labor
party (SPD) tends to defend the labor welfare state and the conservative parties (CDU/CSU)
tend to defend the corporate welfare state. Negotiations on reforms are therefore difficult and
risk delivering awkward compromises. Senior coalition parliamentarians agreed that their
task is challenging. However, they felt that the coalition is tackling pressing issues, and
praised the leadership’s emphasis on harmonious relations in government. They asked that
the coalition be judged on results without a premature verdict on process.

13

A. Fostering Employment Growth
Generous entitlements have kept reservation wages high, limited labor force participation
(especially for elderly and female workers), and raised long-term unemployment. The
discussions focused on boosting the effectiveness of the Hartz labor market reforms to
strengthen employment growth, thus aiding domestic demand (Figure 7).
13.
The authorities’ priority in labor markets is to improve the effectiveness of the
Hartz IV reforms. Many analysts and the staff stress that labor market deregulation beyond
the Hartz reforms is essential, but others see labor policies as an instrument to address
distributional concerns and preserve incomes for those at the bottom (Figure 8). Reflecting
these differences, the Coalition Agreement did not include significant new reforms, focusing
instead on improving the functioning of the Hartz legislation and evaluating the efficacy of
active labor market policies (ALMPs).

14.
The authorities were pleased that
short-term unemployment (in the UB-I
system) is declining. A key accomplishment has been the recent shortening of the
duration of unemployment benefits from
18 to 12 months (except for elderly
workers). Together with the cyclical
upturn, these sharper incentives have
lowered the number of beneficiaries and
the budget costs. Revenues for UB-I are
firming up with contributions to social
security rising as full-time jobs recover
after a long decline.

15.
The bigger challenge, however, is to lower long-term unemployment in the new
UB-II system created by the Hartz IV reforms. Some two-thirds of the 4½ million
unemployed are in the UB-II system, which merged the long-run unemployment system (run
by the Federal Labor Office) with the welfare system (run by local governments). The new
system was intended to improve job placement, lower average benefit levels, and tighten
means testing. However, administration has proved more difficult than expected, benefits
remained more generous than intended, job placements have been few, and means testing has
been inadequate. As a result, reservation wages have remained high and there are more
beneficiaries than expected, preventing the intended decline of costs from pre-reform levels.
16.
Consequently, the authorities are contemplating modifications to labor policies.
Final decisions are pending and the policy debate spans a broad spectrum, ranging from

14
welfare-to-work policies to proposals to protect wage earners from market outcomes deemed
socially undesirable.
•

Welfare-to-work. A government commissioned study by the Council of Economic
Advisors recommends lowering the UB-II benefit level by 30 percent for those
unwilling to accept jobs with local authorities. Those who accept would retain their
full benefit. The rationale is to place the burden of job search on the unemployed
instead of the labor office.

•

Wage subsidies. In a separate proposal, the authorities are considering introducing
selective wage subsidies (Kombilöhne). A pilot program for elderly workers is being
prepared.

•

Minimum wages. The introduction of minimum wages is also under consideration to
“protect” against competition from immigrants from low wage countries and to limit
potential fiscal costs of wage subsidies.

•

Capturing unregulated sectors. The authorities are contemplating new regulations for
temporary work agencies, where jobs are growing quickly from a low base.
Temporary agencies do not fall under any collective labor agreement and with the
absence of minimum wage legislation this has raised concern about abusive labor
practices.

17.
The staff supported the welfare-to-work proposals but argued that the other
proposals go in the wrong direction and risk adding further distortions. The staff
recommended a shift to policies that support activity—instead of inactivity—and therefore
saw merit in lowering the UB-II benefit level by 30 percent. However, minimum wages
would be a serious policy error, as these would introduce subfloors in wage setting (further
reducing job chances for low-skilled labor), where UB-II already effectively determines too
high a reservation wage. Further, wage subsidies would run the risk of rent seeking and high
fiscal costs, and regulating temporary work contracts (one of the few markets with increasing
activity) would cut flexibility in the already overburdened labor market.
18.
The authorities are undertaking a review of active labor market policies
(ALMPs) with a view to curtailing their number. They explained that Germany has
around 80 active programs and preliminary assessments indicate that most of them are
ineffective. Fiscal costs amount to €16 billion a year (0.7 percent of GDP). The staff strongly
supported the intention to cut ALMPs that were shown to have generated few net jobs, and
instead focus on those that work well. Indeed, the multiple ALMPs are described by some as
contributing to the “regulatory jungle” of labor policies.

15
19.
The authorities noted that there was no political consensus to relax employment
protection legislation. Firing costs are almost twice as high as in the OECD on average and
the Coalition Agreement sought to extend the legal employment probation period from 6 to
24 months. However, because this liberalization had been made conditional on new
restrictions on short-term contracts, and because the coalition partners could not agree on
removing this offset, they decided to stick with the existing EPL legislation.
B. Raising Productivity to Support Growth and Wages
Regulatory barriers and significant public ownership continue to impede firm entry in
product and services markets, limiting competition and restraining productivity growth. The
discussions focused on rolling back public ownership, enhancing access to network
industries, and lowering regulatory barriers for liberal professions and in the guilds.
20.
Productivity growth has been uneven across sectors and the domestic economy
remains fragmented with unexploited economies of scale. Foreign competition has
stimulated adjustment and boosted productivity in the manufacturing sector, but there has
been less productivity growth in domestic activity. As a result, labor productivity growth
trails international performance and the domestic sectors—especially retail and wholesale
trade and the liberal professions—account for a substantial share of the shortfall. Analysts
note that lower productivity gains in the trade and retail sectors is related to barriers to IT
adoption stemming from a lack of competition in telecommunication and other network
industries. Although progress has been made in recent years, the staff noted that further
liberalization is needed to facilitate the structural shift toward a services economy. For
example, the OECD and EU Commission have emphasized that network industries in
Germany do not face truly contested markets, despite the partial unbundling of services and
privatization of some large firms in the industries (Figure 9).
21.

The authorities noted that reform of network industries would continue and

Economy-wide productivity growth has been
relatively weak, held back by low productivity
growth outside the manufacturing
(export) sector.

highlighted the following initiatives and issues:
•

Electricity. The Federal Regulatory Agency is starting to use its expanded powers to
regulate (lower) pricing and enhance access for smaller operators.

•

Postal services. The last vestiges of the postal monopoly will be removed on January
1, 2008, as planned.

•

Railways. High level discussions are underway, focusing on whether the already
agreed privatization of the German railways will be limited to its rolling stock or
include a concession to the rail network itself. A decision will be taken soon.

•

Telecommunications. Deutsche Telecom has requested restrictions on access to its
new high-speed fiber network to earn back its investment in this area. According to
the authorities, the decision will depend on whether the fiber network is found to
have established a new market, and thus would avoid competitive interference, or is
part of an already existing market, where restrictions would violate competition
agreements.

22.
The authorities agreed that there is room to deregulate the liberal professions,
but were comfortable with the guild system. Regulation for liberal professions (doctors,
lawyers, notaries, etc.) is notably more restrictive than in the EU-15. The
Monopolkommission has recommended revoking fixed-price lists and certain master’s
licensing requirements. However, the authorities emphasized that the guild system for crafts
provides significant benefits for quality control and is a major provider of apprenticeship
positions. Thus, no policy initiatives are planned to reform the guild system. For liberal
professions, the authorities plan to lower bureaucratic hurdles to broaden the scope for
activities within the existing framework.
23.
The authorities highlighted the initiative in the chancellery to reduce regulation
costs. According to OECD analysis, the administrative burden on enterprises exceeds the
EU-15 average in product markets and tends to favor incumbents. An independent group of
experts is reviewing these costs, using models from the Netherlands and U.K. Henceforth;
new proposals will be subject to a cost-benefit review before submission to parliament. The
authorities target lowering regulatory costs by a quarter, or the equivalent of 1 percent of
GDP, by 2009.

17

C. Improving the Allocation of Capital
Financial sector profitability continues to fall short of peers and strains in the banking
system could reemerge during the next downturn. Capital market activity is increasing but
there is still substantial untapped potential. The discussions focused on structural reforms to
improve the efficiency of the banking system and further deepen capital markets with the aim
of improving the allocation of capital and enhancing financial sector stability.

24.
The cyclical upswing and abundant liquidity have improved earnings for banks
and insurance companies (Figure 10). Cost cutting, which is likely to become increasingly
difficult, and lower provisioning, which probably
cannot be repeated, have also aided bank earnings.3

25.
Staff welcomed the increase in competition and the regulatory changes that are
providing an impetus for reform. Foreign banks are becoming more active in Germany
through takeovers and direct banking (including via the internet). Banks are experiencing
heightened price competition for mortgage, consumer, and business lending, which is
lowering lending margins. Moreover, the mortgage banking sector is consolidating following
last year’s liberalization of the Pfandbriefe market, which is no longer reserved for mortgage
banks and Landesbanken.
26.
Market-driven reform of Landesbanken (LBs) is essential, as staff analysis
suggests that they have imposed a large opportunity cost on the economy (Box 3). The
withdrawal of government guarantees in 2005 is now spurring the LBs to reformulate their
business strategies. Funding costs are rising and arbitrage opportunities—their traditional
mainstay of earnings—are decreasing. To have more direct access to the retail market, the
traditionally wholesale-oriented LBs are examining their relationship with the retail-based
Sparkassen. Some LBs already have retail operations, others are seeking fuller vertical

19
integration with Sparkassen into a single banking conglomerate, and yet others are opting for
looser cooperation, with a demarcation from Sparkassen but still providing services at market
based fees. The staff found a greater willingness to lower public sector stakes in LBs, and in
some cases ownership is already changing, including with participation of private equity
investors. This should have positive consequences for performance.

Box 3. Landesbanken: High Opportunity Costs for the Taxpayer
Landesbanken are a large component of the banking sector. They hold 20 percent of banking
assets and their book equity represents 9 percent of assets on the public sector balance sheet. An
accompanying Selected Issues Paper analyzes the rationale for public ownership of LBs and the
opportunity costs their below-market financial returns imply for taxpayers.
LBs have provided unsatisfactory financial returns. Although some LBs have performed better
than others, overall they have generated substantial direct costs to the taxpayers (in form of capital
injections), and even larger opportunity costs because their returns have been well below peer EU
banks. Staff analysis suggests that these opportunity costs have been ¼ percent of GDP annually
(½ percent of tax revenues) since the early 1990s. Staff simulations also suggest that if these returns
could be equalized from now on to market-based returns of comparator banks, the public sector net
worth would improve by 10 percent of GDP (in present value terms, for comparison, public sector
gross debt is 68 percent of GDP). This would be a significant gain, considering that Germany is
struggling to reduce debt and finance aging cost.
It is difficult to find nonfinancial benefits to justify the low financial returns for taxpayers. LBs
have a traditional mandate to foster local development and provide liquidity and financial services to
local savings banks, but it is unclear what market failure LBs address and how they do this. Rather,
LBs create potential distortions, arising from—admittedly waning—arbitrage opportunities, and from
conflicting roles of the government as owner and supervisor. Further, lower returns earned by LBs are
not offset by lower risk, as evidenced by poorer Z-scores (a measure of default probability) for these
banks as a class than comparator banks, which suggests that they are more likely to become insolvent
than other banks.
LBs represent an inefficient use of public assets. These findings strengthen the case for
disengagement by Länder governments from banking in favor of higher yielding assets or debt
reduction.

27.
The authorities do not share staff views on the need for reform of Sparkassen.
Staff noted that the fragmentation associated with the three pillar banking system and the
Sparkassen system continued to impede revenue growth. Moreover, the regional principle,
which confines Sparkassen to do business in their communities of origin, limits efficiency
and impedes risk diversification. Thus, with new competition emerging in banking, including
direct banking, Sparkassen could come under increasing pressure, arguing for creating the
legal framework to open the door for private capital and market forces to guide restructuring,
including through mergers across pillars. The authorities pointed out that Sparkassen are
exploring efficiency gains through cost-sharing, including in back-offices, and expressed
skepticism that larger efficiency gains could be obtained from liberalization of the regional
principle to exploit scale economies. They also felt the system was competitive because of

the wide-spread presence of Sparkassen and low
concentration ratio, and saw no need to open up the
banks to private capital. Instead, the authorities
stressed that they considered Sparkassen to be
essential for access to banking services in remote
areas and for lower-income households, and as key
providers of credit to the Mittelstand and supporters
of local cultural and community services. They
were confident of the sector’s ability to adapt under
current ownership structures without a need for
market based restructuring.

28.
The authorities continue to be vigilant in regulation and supervision. Staff
supported the move of the supervisory authorities toward risk-oriented supervision of banks,
insurance companies, and financial services companies, and encouraged the publication of
the methodology underlying this approach. With this move, it is important that supervision
be guided solely by prudential criteria determined by the supervisory authorities, and avoid
outside interference. The staff also recommended that the review of the supervisory agency
(BaFin), which has been initiated as called for in the Coalition Agreement, should be used to
reinforce its operational independence. The authorities noted that listed financial institutions
will need to adopt IFRS for their consolidated accounts from 2007 onward and legislation to
implement Basel II capital adequacy standards has been approved by parliament. A number
of insurance groups are already internalizing models for assessing risk under Solvency II and
participation in the relevant Quantitative Impact Studies is high. These actions are in line
with the 2003 FSAP recommendations.
29.
Capital market activity is increasing and fostering efficiency gains, but there is
ample scope for further market deepening. Analysts estimate that mergers and
acquisitions involving German firms could reach 9 percent of GDP in 2006 (€200 billion), a
level last observed during the boom in 2000 and not too far behind the United States.
Opportunities for further private equity participation are large as the business landscape
remains fragmented. The role of venture capital for new startups, however, appears more
constrained. Recognizing the benefits of private capital for the entry of new firms,
innovation, economies of scale, and corporate governance, the authorities are formulating a
more effective legal framework to mobilize additional market financing, including by
streamlining tax incentives. Staff supported this objective and looked forward to the
announcement of specific details.

21

30.
The authorities also attach high priority to establishing real estate investment
trusts (REITs) to increase flexibility of property markets and deepen capital markets.
Germany has a large stock of real estate assets, but the sector has stagnated for a long time
(Box 4). Staff welcomed the authorities’ initiatives and noted that increasing flexibility in the
real estate market has multiple benefits:
•

The property market and construction industry are important sources of jobs, and
Germany stands out for not using its potential to boost growth and productivity.

•

Improvement in the real estate market would also bolster financial sector stability
because a large share of NPLs is collateralized with real property.

•

Experience in other countries has shown that REITs are superior to the open-ended
real estate funds in Germany, which had liquidity problems earlier in 2006, and thus
would improve the availability of long-term saving instruments.

•

Local governments and enterprises in Germany appear ready to divest large realestate holdings to free up liquidity and focus on core activities.

31.
Staff cautioned that the activities of REITs should not be unduly limited and, in
particular, calls to exclude residential real estate should be resisted. Social concerns,
including the potential impact on rental prices, should be addressed through other policy
channels, such as budget transfers. The authorities clarified that negotiations are continuing
on the scope of REITs and outstanding tax issues (e.g., the liability as property is transferred
into REITs and the tax to be paid on dividend distributions) with the aim of introducing
REITs in early 2007.

Germany’s stock of real estate is large. Residential real estate accounts for over half of all real
estate, underscoring its significance for the economy. However, housing price increases have
lagged well behind those in peer countries since the early 1970s (although they started from a
higher level) and, at 43 percent of households, German homeownership trails Western Europe.
Several features have contributed to this performance:
Sluggish income growth. Real disposable income grew by 1.2 percent per year since 1991,
trailing most comparator countries.
Borrowing costs are high. Long-term mortgage rates are among the highest in the euro area,
despite a decline by 0.7 percentage points since end-2002, lowering their spread over long-term
government bond yields. This suggests that mortgage market competition is rising.
Rental yields are low. The average rental yield is 3½ percent. Rent controls in federal law cap the
yield, and limit cumulative rent increases to 20 percent over three years.
Restrictions favor tenants. Landlords can terminate leases only under narrowly defined
circumstances.
Large blocs of property are owned by local governments and corporations. During the
housing shortage of the 1960s, public companies were created to provide housing, or industry
provided housing for its employees. Both are now trying to unload properties to remove these lowyielding assets from their balance sheets.

23
D. Advancing Fiscal Consolidation and Long-Run Sustainability
Budget consolidation has been aided by the economic rebound, but there has also been
significant structural adjustment. Nevertheless, the high structural deficit and aging-related
pressures call for continued fiscal consolidation and entitlement reform. The discussions
focused on fiscal objectives and policies for 2007 and the medium term, reform initiatives for
the corporate income tax and health care systems, and long-run fiscal challenges.
32.
Germany is making sizeable progress toward reducing the structural deficit and
improving the long-run fiscal outlook (Table 6). The grand coalition has maintained the
previous government’s approach of cutting expenditure and decided to complement this by
raising the VAT in 2007. Prominent expenditure measures include phasing out the home
construction subsidy, reducing the commuter subsidy, lowering public sector employment,
and freezing wage rates. Aging-related expenditure has also been reduced through lower
pension indexation, tighter eligibility for early retirement, a gradual extension of the
pensionable age from 65 to 67 starting in 2012, and higher co-payments in health care. Taken
together, these efforts have resulted in a substantial improvement in the public sector balance
sheet (see below). The improvement for the public sector has meant an adjustment burden for
the private sector, which has contributed to holding back domestic demand.
33.
With assistance of the cyclical upswing, the authorities noted that a substantial
reduction of the deficit is underway in 2006-2007. Tax revenue has benefited from the
economic rebound and is running well ahead of projections. Notably, the social security fund
is in surplus with the uptick in employment, and corporate profit taxes are booming. For
2006, the staff projects the deficit to decline to 2.4 percent of GDP from 3.2 percent in 2005,
thereby observing the commitments under the excessive deficit procedure one year ahead of
schedule. Continued expenditure restraint is expected to contribute to structural adjustment
of about ½ percent of GDP in 2006, exceeding initial plans. At the time of the mission (and
prior to the update of the growth forecasts), the authorities cautiously projected the deficit to
fall to 2.8 percent of GDP in 2006 and 2.3 percent in 2007, with a net contribution of
⅓ percent of GDP from the VAT hike and the partially offsetting cut in unemployment
insurance contributions.
34.
For 2007, the staff noted that a lower deficit is achievable on current policies and
that the authorities should therefore aim for a more ambitious target. Specifically,
assuming no expenditure slippage (an assumption that cannot be taken for granted), the fiscal
deficit could be reduced further to at most 1.6 percent of GDP. This is 0.7 percentage point
less (cumulative over 2006-2007) than indicated by the authorities, in part because their
revenue estimates were based on a previous (lower) growth scenario. Taking 2006 and 2007
together, the structural deficit would then be reduced by about 1¼ percent of GDP, with
about two-thirds of the improvement based on expenditure containment. In the outer years,
however, problems with revenue buoyancy would remain because the largest tax bases
(wages and consumption) have structurally weakened with the economy’s drawn-out

24
adjustment, continued high unemployment, and only moderate structural reforms (Figure 11).
Further, interest rates on the debt have been low recently, and may be expected to increase
going forward. In view of these pressures and notwithstanding the cyclical pickup in
revenue, the staff supported the authorities’ firm intention to proceed with the VAT increase,
which is part of their strategy to shift from direct to indirect taxes.

Beyond 2007, even with the VAT increase the staff sees a risk that the deficit will
get stuck at 1¾ to 2 percent of GDP. Measures such as the cut in commuter and home
construction subsidies will generate additional savings over time, but these will be
insufficient to offset rising interest costs and some revenue losses from the corporate income
tax reform (below). Hence, the authorities are expected to fall short of their targeted
adjustment of ½ percent of GDP a year beyond 2007, which is the minimum necessary to
achieve structural balance in 2010. This goal is appropriate and to meet it the staff
recommended implementing additional cuts in subsidies and tax expenditures (which remain
significant) and in spending on ineffective ALMPs. Emphasis on such measures would have
the added advantage of reducing distortions in the economy. Analysis using the Global Fiscal
Model suggests that a well chosen mix of policies to eliminate the structural deficit in this
timeframe will have a modest negative effect on growth (Box 5).

25
Box 5. Germany: Analyzing Fiscal Plans with the Global Fiscal Model
The IMF’s Global Fiscal Model (GFM) was used to analyze the implications of
Germany’s fiscal plans on public debt and economic activity. GFM endogenizes labor
supply, consumption, and investment decisions, and is also suitable to evaluate economic
spillovers to other regions (see section V). The Selected Issues Paper on GFM focuses on the
effects of achieving structural balance and the three tax reform initiatives in 2007 and 2008: (i)
a VAT increase from 16 to 19 percent, (ii) some offsetting reduction in unemployment
insurance taxes; and (iii) a reduction in corporate income tax rates with base broadening.
Achieving structural balance over the medium term would significantly improve debt
dynamics by prefunding future aging related liabilities. A combination of expenditure cuts,
entitlement reform, revenue enhancement through base broadening and tax reform is most
efficient and realistic. Eliminating the structural deficit by 2010 with such a policy mix would
hold back short-run growth by about 0.2 percent a year relative to a scenario with no
adjustment, but will bring compensating benefits in the long-run.
The government’s proposed tax policy measures imply a shift from direct to indirect
taxation. GFM suggests that this will increase economic efficiency over time. It will lead to
some sacrifice in growth and consumption in 2007 (higher VAT), but increase labor demand
and incentives to save and invest over the medium term (lower payroll and corporate tax rates).
The tax reforms would lower the long-run debt ratio, but not enough to offset aging related
fiscal pressures. Therefore, further adjustment in entitlement expenditure is needed.

36.
The authorities have put high priority on reforming the corporate income tax
(CIT) and health care systems. As both reforms are still in development, their projections
do not take them into account. If designed well, the reforms would raise efficiency while
containing budget costs. In view of the risks, the staff argued that they should be
implemented carefully to avoid a need for later corrections (as has happened with some
previous reforms), even if this means taking more time to negotiate sound agreements.
37.
The CIT reform aims to lower tax rates, which are to be compensated in part by
base broadening. The authorities noted that statutory corporate tax rates in Germany are
high by international standards and they plan to reduce the tax rate from 39 to 29 percent.4
Current proposals aim to limit the annual revenue loss to ¼ percent of GDP. The authorities’
most recent proposal (finalized after the mission) includes limits on the deduction of interest
costs only in specific cases where there is evidence of borrowing from foreign subsidiaries to
shift profits abroad. This is a moderation from initial proposals of broader limits on interest
and leasing cost deductions, which, as pointed out by staff and others, could have induced
unintended distortions in business decisions. Reducing Germany’s comparatively high rate of

depreciation allowances is under consideration to broaden the tax base. The staff also noted
that increasing revenue from the tax on business property should be considered, but the
authorities pointed out that the impact of the overall reform would then be substantially
different for proprietorships and corporations, and therefore was rejected. The authorities
intend to implement the reform in January 2008.
38.
Cabinet proposals on health care reform do not appear sufficiently ambitious.
Health care costs are high and are the main fiscal pressure from aging. Thus, reform is
critical. The government has proposed creating a new central health fund (to be launched in
2009) to pool wage-based contributions that are then disbursed to the individual insurance
funds, with the insured allowed to switch funds. However, the central issue of changing the
funding of healthcare to reduce pressure on labor costs has not been tackled. Further,
although the reform aims to introduce competition among health providers and insurers, the
upward trajectory of long-run health costs is unlikely to slow significantly. And, the
financing of child healthcare will be gradually shifted to general taxes, but there is no
indication yet of how the budget impact (¾ percent of GDP per year) will be
offset. Parliamentary discussion could result in changes to the plan, but the risk that the
reform will fall short of requirements is large.
The population will decline, and
dependency will rise.

Germany’s near-term fiscal
challenges need to be seen in a long-run
context. Notwithstanding the progress
made, given Germany’s projected
demographics, long-run debt sustainability
is not yet assured and further adjustment in
entitlement and other programs will need
to be an essential part of the menu to
address future fiscal pressures. Reforms to
boost employment and productivity,
combined with a more dynamic financial
system and capital markets are also needed
to raise growth and improve the fiscal
outlook.

27
40.
The progress made toward fiscal sustainability and the road that remains to be
traveled can be seen in the long-run fiscal projections and public sector balance sheet.
The combined financial and nonfinancial net worth on the public sector balance sheet is
nearly exhausted (current net worth in the table below). In addition, the staff has calculated
the NPV of the impact of projected future fiscal deficits with increasing aging costs under
current policies and alternative assumptions about the fiscal balance in 2010 (Figure 12).
Taken together, the current net worth and implicit liabilities provide a view on the
comprehensive (intertemporal) net worth of the public sector.5 Two conclusions follow:
(i) major progress has been made in strengthening the comprehensive net worth of general
government in recent years (thereby presumably slowing the recovery in the private sector)
and, (ii) the job remains incomplete and debt sustainability not assured even if the
government achieves a zero fiscal balance by 2010.

projections) was reduced. As a
result, by the end of 2005, the comprehensive deficit in net worth was reduced to just over
100 percent of GDP. If the government achieves budgetary balance by 2010 (measures are
not yet in place to guarantee this), the shortfall in the comprehensive net worth could be
reduced further to about 30 percent of GDP. Under the EU Aging Working Group
assumption that aging costs have been reduced to 2.75 percent of GDP, comprehensive net
worth would be close to zero as shown in the 2006 columns above. However, both these
projections may prove too optimistic as health spending in particular may be underestimated.
A risk scenario by IFO (not yet published) that extrapolates recent health care price increases
to 2050 suggest that total aging costs could still rise by over 7 percent of GDP.
42.
The authorities intend to make further progress in reining in long term fiscal
pressures. In addition to the CIT and health care reforms yielding some efficiency gains for
the budget, they saw additional potential for discretionary expenditure cuts. In this regard,
they are exploring increased use of public-private partnerships (PPPs) to take over some
infrastructure spending now carried on-budget; and they are considering reformulating their
constitutional “golden rule” rule under which new debt placement cannot exceed capital
spending. However, in the staff’s view, PPPs should be approached with caution because
they can result in large contingent liabilities. And, although there is indeed scope to improve
the design of the golden rule, it needs to be done in a way that does not loosen fiscal
constraints.

Germany’s external current
account has gone from balance in 2001 to
a surplus of 4 percent of GDP in 2005.
The counterpart is mostly found among the
other euro-area countries, with the result
that the euro area current account has
remained broadly balanced over this period.
Germany’s export market share of intraeuro zone trade has risen, while it declined
for France, Italy, and Spain. Thus,
Germany’s competitiveness gains have
pressured other euro-zone countries to
adjust as well.

44.
Outside the euro-area, the new EU members have benefited from Germany’s
proximity. These countries are attractive locations for intermediate production with a willing
and low-cost workforce enjoying rapid productivity gains; reorganizing part of the
production chain to these lower cost countries has contributed to improving German
competitiveness. Thus, German FDI is flowing into Eastern Europe, providing these
countries a boost. This location competition, however, added to pressure on German workers,
especially those with weak skills. The authorities said that they do not intend to open up the
economy to full labor mobility until the end of the transition period agreed among EU partner
countries.

45.
Moving beyond the EU to global repercussions, the authorities were confident
that their policy agenda will assist in resolving global imbalances. They recognize that
the current account surplus is large and indicated that their reform agenda aims to strengthen
the supply side of the economy to lay the basis for stronger domestic demand. Indeed, they
were encouraged that employment and domestic demand had now begun to pick up. The
authorities also stressed their intention to maintain open trading relations and welcomed
foreign investment, including in the financial sector and network industries, and hoped that
other countries would reciprocate.
46.
Staff analysis using GFM indicates that spillovers from German fiscal plans on
partner countries are moderate. Fiscal adjustment in Germany increases its current
account surplus by reducing demand for imports. However, the effect on partner countries’
growth and current account balances are moderate because a balanced adjustment package
leads to only a temporary and small reduction in German consumption and import demand.
Furthermore, as Germany is well integrated in international capital markets, there is an offset
on partner country growth through lower interest rates, but this effect is also small.
VI. STAFF APPRAISAL
47.
After several years of meager growth, a brisk cyclical recovery is finally
underway. Corporate restructuring and wage moderation have lowered costs and improved
competitiveness and the current level of the real effective exchange rate is broadly in line
with fundamentals. These private sector adjustments were accompanied by reforms of labor
market and social welfare programs. The grand coalition that came into office a year ago
committed to continue on this path. The upswing has also benefited from a robust expansion
of the world economy, and strong exports are beginning to spur investment.
48.
Without deeper structural change, however, the improved cyclical prospects do
not alter Germany’s low growth potential. External competitiveness has been restored, but
domestic efficiency remains low and unemployment is intolerably high. The upswing
provides a favorable setting to tackle these problems by implementing mutually reinforcing
policies. Specifically, labor market flexibility needs to be improved to speed up job growth
and increase labor utilization. Parallel productivity-enhancing reforms in product, service
and financial markets are needed to magnify the impact of labor reforms. And, fiscal
consolidation and entitlement reforms are critical to increase confidence in the sustainability
of the welfare state. If the reforms are too timid or unduly delayed, Germany could miss out
again on the increase in living standards seen in other leading economies over the last
decade.
49.
Employment growth needs to accelerate to generate higher household income
and consumption, thus broadening the recovery. The recent uptick in full-time jobs is
encouraging. However, reducing structural unemployment will require lower reservation
wages to bolster employment prospects for the lower skilled. Policies need to raise labor

31
utilization through support for activity rather than inactivity, which will have the added
benefit of reducing structural welfare costs.
50.
Recent labor market reforms need to be modified and their implementation
strengthened. Efforts to tackle the core problem of long-term unemployment have been
expensive but largely unsuccessful. Therefore, improving the functioning of the
Unemployment Benefit II system should be a top priority. As recommended by the Council
of Economic Experts and several research institutes, the allowance provided under UB-II
should be cut until there is demonstrated work effort. Introducing minimum wages, as
proposed by others, would be a serious mistake because it would undermine job creation and
hurt job seekers. Equally, new wage subsidies should not be introduced as UB-II already has
elements of employment support and acts as a wage floor.
51.
More generally, many of Germany's active labor market programs and
regulations are complex, expensive, and ineffective. The ineffective programs should be
eliminated; those that are retained should be simplified to increase transparency, including
for job seekers.
52.
Additional deregulation of product and service markets is needed to strengthen
competition and raise productivity, and should be higher on the policy agenda.
Productivity ultimately determines the standard of living and greater reliance on efficiency
gains would put less burden on relative wage adjustments and be beneficial for Germany and
its trading partners. The recommendations of the Monopolkommission to liberalize licensing
requirements for crafts and price schedules for professional services, where conditions favor
incumbents, should be implemented without delay. Further, it is essential to improve the
contestability of markets in network industries to help capture efficiency gains and benefit
consumers. This will require stepping up privatization and reducing network access costs.
53.
A more efficient financial sector would improve the allocation of capital to areas
of highest return, strengthening economic performance. Banks and insurance companies
are healthier than in recent years, but the improvement in earnings is largely cyclical and
they still underperform most EU peers. Adjustment needs to be accelerated in the large
public banking pillar. The withdrawal of government guarantees has spurred Landesbanken
to develop new strategies. Ownership structures of several banks are changing, which should
have positive consequences for performance. However, it remains vital to allow more private
capital to enter public sector banks to harness market signals and facilitate restructuring.
Such changes are overdue as strains could reemerge during the next downturn and
developments in neighboring countries risk leaving leave the German banking system
behind.
54.
Supervision should be guided solely by prudential criteria determined by the
supervisory authorities. In this context, the ongoing review of BaFin provides a good
opportunity to buttress its operational independence. The supervisory authorities’ move

32
toward more risk-oriented supervision is appropriate, but the methodology underlying riskoriented supervision should be published to strengthen transparency.
55.
Capital markets are deepening and playing a greater role in guiding corporate
decisions. The untapped potential remains large. The authorities should proceed in
formulating a more effective legal framework for private equity because such financing can
facilitate the entry of new firms, spur innovation, and enhance corporate governance.
56.
Increasing flexibility in the real estate market would also contribute to economic
efficiency. This market has stagnated with low liquidity and controls on rental markets. The
immediate priority should be to introduce REITs covering both residential and commercial
property. These trusts can facilitate divestiture and allow owners to focus on core activities.
57.
Good progress has been made in reducing the fiscal deficit in 2006 and policies
are in place for further adjustment in 2007, thereby bolstering sustainability. Although
expenditure-based measures should continue to be the cornerstone for lasting fiscal
adjustment, the VAT increase combined with a reduction in payroll taxes is a positive
structural measure. The goal should be to reduce the deficit to below 2 percent of GDP in
2007, which is achievable without additional discretionary measures as long as the
authorities do not yield to the expenditure demands that tend to accompany strong revenue
growth. The past mistake of failing to consolidate during the upswing should be not be
repeated. Thus, any additional revenue should be used to reduce borrowing, not to increase
spending.
58.
Beyond 2007, however, unless additional measures are implemented, there is a
danger that the deficit will begin to rise again. The aim should be to implement structural
adjustment of at least ½ percent of GDP a year to achieve structural balance by 2010 and
anticipate pressure from population aging. To meet this goal, the authorities should further
reduce subsidies and tax expenditures, cut spending on active labor market programs, and
lower unemployment costs. Measures should also continue to focus on reducing agingrelated structural expenditure by reforming entitlement programs.
59.
Corporate income tax and health care reforms need to be implemented in a way
that meets stated objectives without increasing fiscal risks. The budgetary cost of the
planned reduction in statutory corporate tax rates should be capped at the agreed ¼ percent of
GDP. Base broadening such as normalizing accelerated depreciation rates or raising revenue
from the tax on business assets would be preferable to reducing interest deductibility as a
business cost. Lowering the trajectory of health care costs will require a substantial increase
in competition among health care providers and insurers without adding to bureaucracy, and
further efforts are needed to decouple healthcare financing from payroll charges.. The current
proposals do not meet these objectives.

33
60.
Although policies have made a solid contribution to reducing long-run aging
costs, long-run fiscal sustainability is not yet assured. Even if the structural deficit is
eliminated by 2010 (for which measures are not yet in place), the debt ratio would come
under pressure in the long run. Moreover, further research is needed to pin down better the
remaining aging costs. A comprehensive strategy to secure long-run sustainability should
combine fiscal measures with reforms to increase productivity and labor utilization.
61.
It is proposed that the next Article IV consultation be held on the standard 12-month
cycle.

1/ According to Capital Adequacy Regulation, Principle I.
2/ The 2005 number follows the IMF's Compilation Guide on FSIs. Namely, it is the ratio (in percent) of assets and liabilities with a remaining maturity of
three months or less. Given that this indicator is not available for earlier periods, the "liquidity ratio" used by prudential supervision is shown instead for
2000-04.

Exchange Rate Arrangement:

Since January 1, 1999, Germany has been a member of the European Economic and
Monetary Union; the deutsche mark entered EMU at a value of DM 1.95583 per euro.
Germany is an Article VIII member and maintains an exchange system free of restrictions on
payments and transfers for current international transactions. It maintains measures adopted
for security reasons, which have been notified to the Fund for approval in accordance with
the procedures of Decision 144 (see EBD/06/123, October 24, 2006).

Article IV Consultations:

Germany is on a 12-month consultation cycle. The staff report for the last Article IV
consultation (IMF Country Report No. 06/16) was discussed at EBM 06/2
(January 11, 2006).
IX.

Anti-Money Laundering/Combating the Financing of Terrorism (AML/CFT)

The supervisory authorities' move towards more risk-based supervision is being reflected in
the AML/CFT framework. In a 2003 evaluation, the Financial Action Task Force (FATF)
found that the AML/CFT framework is generally of high quality. Improvements were
recommended to make AML/CFT audits and inspections more systematic and frequent. In
view of concerns about costs for supervised institutions, the numbers of audits and
inspections have not increased substantially between 2003 and 2006. However, the
authorities recognize that AML/CFT is an important issue, and have moved towards a more
risk-based approach, in which the intensity of audits and inspections should reflect
institutions' AML/CFT risk. To improve the quality of audit reports, BaFin has started a
dialogue with the associations of certified public accountants and other auditors, resulting
among other things in the publication by the association of certified public accountants of a
significantly revised AML/CFT assessment methodology in 2005. Further steps in the
AML/CFT framework include revisions of the law granting the BaFin the power to freeze
funds without a court order or other involvement of prosecution authorities if there is a
suspicion of terrorist financing, and requiring financial holding groups and financial
conglomerates to develop a coordinated risk management approach for the whole group.

56
APPENDIX III. Germany: Statistical Issues
Germany’s economic and financial statistics are adequate for surveillance purposes.
Germany has a full range of statistical publications and subscribes to the Fund’s Special Data
Dissemination Standard (SDDS). The authorities make substantial use of the Internet to
facilitate on-line access to data and press information.
Germany adopted the European System of Integrated Economic Accounts 1995 (ESA95)
in 1999. In April 2005, revised national accounts statistics were released to comply with
EUROSTAT requirements. Germany adopted chain-linking to its price and volume
measures, allocated financial intermediation services to the users, and introduced new data
(e.g. based on hedonic pricing).
The 2005 ROSC Data Module mission found that the macroeconomic statistics generally
follow internationally accepted standards and guidelines on concepts and definitions, scope,
classification and sectorization, and basis for recording. However, the sources for estimating
value added for a few categories of service industries could be improved. A direct source for
quarterly changes in inventories, which is an important contributor to short-term deviation in
the trend GDP growth rate, is lacking. There is no systematic, proactive process to monitor
the ongoing representativeness of the samples of local units and products between rebases of
the producer price index. Comprehensive data reporting systems support the accuracy and
reliability of the government finance and balance of payments statistics.
Other gaps are: although explanatory documentation exists, the lack of a table bridging the
general government data in the ESA95 classification and the general government cash data
on an administrative basis is viewed as impairing fiscal analysis; Germany only publishes
general government revenue, expenditure, and balance on an accrual basis every six months
(ESA95). Monthly data are, however, disseminated on a cash-basis.
Following the adoption of the ESA95 standard for fiscal reporting by member countries of
the European Union, the IMF Statistics Department is collaborating with member states and
Eurostat to implement a bridge table that makes simultaneous reporting for the ESA95 and
the Government Finance Statistics Manual 2001 possible. Germany has chosen not to use
this option for the purposes of the Government Finance Statistics Yearbook (GFSY) 2006.
The GFSY reports annual data for Germany using the framework of the Government Finance
Statistics Manual 2001. These data refer to the central, state and local, and the general
government.
The 2003 FSAP mission found that the availability and timeliness of financial soundness
indicators were relatively weak. The situation has since improved. Germany is participating
in the Coordinated Compilation Exercise for financial soundness indicators (FSIs). In 2006,
as part of this exercise, the German authorities have compiled a comprehensive set of FSI
data and metadata that will soon serve as a basis for regular compilation of FSIs.

Statement by the IMF Staff Representative
December 8, 2006

This statement provides information on economic developments since the staff report was
issued. The new information does not alter the thrust of the staff appraisal.
Results for the third quarter of 2006 and data revisions for previous quarters have
led to an upward revision of GDP growth projections. The staff’s updated forecasts
are for growth of 2.5 percent in 2006 and 1.5 percent in 2007 (Table below). Although
third quarter growth was marginally below staff projections, growth estimates for the first
and second quarters were increased, and recent high-frequency indicators have remained
stronger than expected, together suggesting a higher growth rate for 2006.

The revision in the first half of the year primarily reflects higher investment spending
than was previously estimated. The Bundesbank estimates that growth in the second
quarter includes some ¼ percentage point in one-time demand from the World Cup
soccer tournament (mainly tourism exports).
Economic indicators suggest increasing traction for domestic demand. Full-time
employment continued to expand over the summer months, boding well for a continued
recovery. The construction sector is expanding, after a long decline, and industrial orders
remained strong with a larger weight from domestic orders.
Year-on-year inflation is declining as anticipated. In October, inflation was 1.1 percent
(CPI-HICP), slightly below the rate for August and mainly reflecting lower oil prices.
Preliminary data for November point to an uptick to 1.5 percent as some price categories
are increased ahead of the VAT hike in January 2007. The core rate of inflation,
excluding energy prices, is slightly over 1 percent.
The recovery and the freeze on pensions and public sector wages are helping to
lower the fiscal deficit. Tax revenue continues to exceed earlier expectations, and the
authorities have revised their outlook for the general government deficit to 2.1 percent of
GDP in 2006, and the federal budget for 2007 is consistent with a general government

2
deficit target of 1.5 percent of GDP.1 In the staff report (¶34 and associated text table),
staff had argued that the authorities should aim to reduce the structural deficit by a
cumulative 1¼ percent of GDP in 2006-2007. Budget details are still pending, but staff’s
preliminary estimate is that the authorities’ latest deficit figures are consistent with a
cumulative reduction in the structural deficit closer to 1 percent of GDP in 2006-2007.
The slightly lower structural adjustment reflects in part an additional cut in
unemployment insurance (payroll) taxes. The November 2005 Coalition Agreement
envisaged cutting the unemployment insurance contribution rate from 6.5 to 4.5 percent.
With the recent strong tax revenues, the authorities have decided to reduce the
unemployment insurance rate further to 4.2 percent instead. This concession is a political
economy compromise, accommodating pressures to utilize some of the windfall revenue
gain; the staff continues to recommend that permanent tax reductions be offset with
permanent expenditure cuts.
As part of its outreach strategy, the staff held a one-day symposium on long-run
fiscal sustainability in Berlin on Monday, November 20, 2006. The symposium was
organized together with the IFO Institute for Economic Research and the Bertelsmann
Foundation to stimulate the domestic debate on aging-related issues and fiscal
sustainability and, in this regard, to draw attention to the value of a public sector balance
sheet. The symposium revealed that the German authorities at both the federal and
Länder level are increasingly focusing on aging and population decline in their
deliberations of a new fiscal framework that could accommodate aging related pressures
over the longer run, including in the negotiations on a second round reform of fiscal
federalism and possible modifications to the tax revenue sharing arrangements. The
experience in the symposium also suggested that such meetings can help to foster a better
appreciation among analysts of the important strides that are being made by the
authorities, and remaining challenges, in tackling future aging costs.

The 2007 federal budget has been approved in the lower house of parliament (Bundestag). It projects a net
debt placement of €19.6 billion, which would achieve compliance with Germany’s constitutional Golden
Rule for the first time in several years and be the lowest net debt placement since unification in 1991. The
upper house of Parliament (Bundesrat) is scheduled to debate the federal budget on December 15th.

Statement by Klaus D. Stein, Executive Director for Germany
December 8, 2006

Overview
1.
The German economy is experiencing a robust upswing this year, growing at its
fastest pace since 2000. While exports remain very strong, the main contribution to output
growth is expected to come from accelerating domestic demand. The upswing is driven by
solid profit expectations and increased capacity utilization, alongside the ongoing
improvement in the labor market.
2.
Being well aware of the cyclical factors supporting the recovery, the German
government strongly believes that the various reforms since the Agenda 2010 of 2003
(in particular labor market reforms Hartz I-IV, as well as pension, health care, federalism,
and capital market reforms) are beginning to show a positive impact on the economy. In
addition, the carefully designed fiscal strategy, enacted by the Grand Coalition upon
assuming office, is now supporting the upswing. The strategy rests on two pillars: the
investment stimulating package Impuls and the gradually phased consolidation of the general
government budget. This phased approach is now meeting its objective, which is to help the
economy embark on a self-sustained growth path strong enough to endure the necessary
fiscal consolidation.
3.
However, the German economy is not yet out of the woods. Continued fiscal
prudence and structural reforms are essential to address the challenges presented by
globalization and population aging. My authorities are therefore continuing the reform
process, labeled as path breaking in earlier staff reports. The reforms underway, while
intensely debated within government and society, will eventually help ensure medium and
long-term fiscal sustainability, promote employment, and further improve the environment
for investment and job creation.
Economic Outlook
4.
My authorities and the staff broadly agree on the economic outlook for this and next
year. For 2006, the government projects real GDP growth of 2.3 percent, which it considers
to be a conservative projection. Strong private investment and construction activity are the
main drivers of growth. Importantly, the construction sector has started to expand again after
many years of negative growth. The situation in the labor market has improved considerably
and is bolstering the beginning recovery of private consumption. Export growth remains
brisk reflecting a competitive manufacturing sector. Net exports are nonetheless contributing
a smaller share towards output growth due to the acceleration of imports.

2
5.
After benefiting from one-time effects this year, the economy will likely slow down
somewhat at the beginning of 2007 due to the fiscal consolidation package. However, given
the strong underlying momentum of the economy, my authorities share the staff’s confidence
that the slowdown will only be temporary – an expectation that is supported by current
high-frequency indicators. Overall, my authorities expect real GDP to expand by 1.4 percent
in 2007 and the labor market to show further improvement. Inflation, which has been well
below the eurozone average, will likely move up due to the forthcoming VAT increase,
though only on a temporary basis.
Advancing Fiscal Consolidation
6.
Continued expenditure restraint and accelerating economic activity will pave the way
for a significant improvement in public finances this year. The general government deficit is
now expected to be at 2.1 percent of GDP, as compared to a projection of 3 ½ percent of
GDP at the time of the last Article IV consultation. As a result, the Maastricht deficit
criterion will be met one year earlier than expected.
7.
In 2007, the bulk of the windfall revenues will be used for reducing the general
government deficit, which is projected to be at 1 ½ percent of GDP. Nevertheless, my
authorities remain convinced that further structural adjustment of the budget is essential.
They will therefore proceed as planned to implement their fiscal consolidation package, a key
element of which is the increase of the VAT rate by three percentage points. This increase
will still leave the German VAT rate below the EU average. One percentage point of VAT is
earmarked to help fund the forthcoming reduction of unemployment insurance contribution
rates by one third. More generally, the tax increase reflects a deliberate shift from direct to
indirect taxes aimed to enhance economic efficiency. It is worth noting that despite the VAT
increase, the revenue to GDP ratio will remain largely unchanged in 2007.
8.
The structural fiscal improvement this year and next will in total be well above one
percent of GDP, in line with staff recommendations. Beyond 2007, my authorities remain
committed to continued structural fiscal adjustment over the medium-term. Annual growth of
general government spending will be limited to 1 percent in nominal terms over the period of
2006 to 2010. At the end of this period, my authorities expect a budget deficit of close to
balance.
9.
The staff’s long-run fiscal projections and indicative public sector balance sheet are
welcome analytical tools as they heighten awareness for the pressing issue of fiscal
sustainability. While further adjustment measures will be required to ensure long-term fiscal
sustainability, it should be noted that a number of actions are forthcoming or have already
been implemented. These include inter alia the gradual increase of the retirement age and the
phasing out of the homeowner subsidy. These measures will generate increasing expenditure
savings over the longer term.

3

10.
Entitlement reforms are progressing with a view to improving the long-term fiscal
outlook. Further to the pension reforms of recent years, the cabinet recently decided to
gradually raise the statutory retirement age from 65 to 67 years from 2012 onwards, as
mentioned above. After intense debate on health care reform, the coalition government has
been able to reach agreement on a substantive proposal. While stopping short of some more
radical blueprints, the reform will instill more competition and transparency into the system
through a broad array of measures to be phased in from April 2007. It will thus increase cost
efficiency, while preserving the high quality of the German health care system. Furthermore,
a reform proposal to strengthen the financial viability of long-term care insurance will be put
forward in 2007.
11.
The fiscal framework has been improved considerably by the federalism reform
enacted earlier this year. Competencies of the federal government and the Länder have been
disentangled. Fiscal discipline has been supported by clarifying the respective responsibilities
of the federal government and the Länder in the context of the European Stability and
Growth Pact. A second round of reforms focusing on the overhaul of financial relations
between the various government entities will be launched in the near future.
Supporting Investment and Growth
12.
As also acknowledged in earlier Article IV reports, since the 1990s Germany has
made significant strides in liberalizing product markets and rolling back public ownership.
Looking ahead, the government is determined to further improve the business climate, inter
alia by reforming the corporate income tax (CIT), ensuring free and competitive product
markets, and reducing the administrative burden. Alongside labor market reforms and
improved conditions for research, development, and innovation, these actions should
gradually feed into a pick-up in potential growth.
13.
The proposed CIT reform will go a long way towards raising Germany’s
attractiveness as a place to do business. The reform essentially involves a significant
reduction of the composite corporate tax rate, which is currently among the highest in
Europe, to just below 30 percent. This will be largely financed by broadening the tax base,
although there will still be a reduction of the overall business tax burden by €5 billion. The
thrust of the reform is thus in line with the international trend (tax-cut-cum-base-broadening
policy). In the process, the tax system will be simplified, and various provisions will be
introduced to reduce distortions in terms of tax treatment depending on the legal structure of
the company, and to discourage profit shifting abroad.
14.
The CIT reform is due for cabinet approval in March 2007 and for implementation in
January 2008. It will be based on a recent proposal by a working group. This proposal differs
in important respects from earlier deliberations that form the basis for the staff analysis. In

4
particular, the initial proposal to limit interest deductibility, criticized by the staff and others,
has now been largely abandoned. Also, accelerated depreciation provisions will be
eliminated, as proposed by the staff.
15.
On the electricity and gas industries, the new regulatory framework on access to
networks and unbundling of services is currently being implemented. On liberal professions,
bureaucratic hurdles are being lowered. On the guild system, while there are no plans for
further reforms at this stage, several guilds have already been deregulated in recent years.
Furthermore, in the first half of 2007, the government will conduct a review of the
recommendations of the Monopolkommission, an independent advisory body dealing with
issues of regulation and fair competition. Finally, we would note the ongoing comprehensive
initiative aimed at lowering the overall administrative burden, as well as the plans of some
Länder to further relax restrictions on shopping hours, some of which henceforth will be
among the most liberal in Europe.
16.
Raising Germany’s potential growth requires a substantial effort to boost research,
development, and innovation. My authorities have made it a key priority to support this
process. For example, from 2006 to 2009 the federal government will invest an additional
€6 billion in R&D projects. This will contribute significantly to further increasing total
R&D-investment (public and private) from currently 2.5 percent to 3 percent of GDP by
2010.
Fostering Employment
17.
Unemployment has declined by more than half a million and the number of regular
jobs subject to social security contributions has risen by more than 300,000 over the past
year. Furthermore, the number of recipients of long-term unemployment assistance (UB-II)
has declined markedly as of late. In particular, the latter shows that the labor market reforms
of recent years are bearing fruit, even taking into account the support provided by the cyclical
upswing.
18.
Nevertheless, the still high unemployment is a matter of concern and its reduction
remains high on the government’s agenda. At the same time, further reforms must strike a
careful balance between flexibility and security, and it is of utmost importance that they have
the necessary backing in the broader public. Against this background, and after the
far-reaching changes already implemented in recent years, my authorities intend to proceed
gradually with further reforms.
19.
In August, legislative changes were enacted to address inefficiencies and cost
overruns that have emerged under the new UB-II system. Furthermore, the provisions of
means testing that have been adopted under the Hartz IV reforms will be implemented more

5
rigorously. In addition, the cabinet intends to put forward proposals for further labor market
reforms by the first quarter of next year, aimed at improving job incentives.
20.
As regards active labor market policies (ALMPs), an evaluation including input from
academia is currently being finalized. On this basis, a thorough overhaul of ALMPs is
envisaged for 2007, aimed at eliminating those policies of limited effectiveness.
21.
In order to strengthen incentives for labor demand and supply, the payroll tax wedge
will be reduced considerably in 2007. The contribution rate for unemployment insurance will
be lowered significantly, to be offset by a small increase of the contribution rate for pensions.
This will result in a net reduction of non-wage labor costs by 1.9 percentage points.
Financial Sector
22.
Numerous actions have been taken over the past years to improve the institutional
framework governing financial markets. The German government is continuing along this
path of swiftly and fully implementing agreed EU regulations while modernizing remaining
national financial sector laws and regulations. This will ensure that the German financial
system becomes even more effective in supporting economic growth, while maintaining
strong prudential oversight.
23.
Financial sector profitability has continued to rise this year and last, reflecting cost
cutting, lower provisioning, and improved risk management, as well as cyclical factors.
German banks are also increasingly tapping new sources of income generation. That said,
profitability is not yet on par with international levels and innovation needs to advance
further.
24.
The restructuring of the Landesbanken (LBs) is making progress. Vertical integration
of some LBs with regional savings banks (Sparkassen) is at an advanced stage. Others have
been transformed into joint stock corporations operating under private law. This process will
be continued.
25.
That being said, my authorities consider that the staff’s findings on the LBs’
opportunity costs need to be qualified. First, caution should be used when extrapolating the
results. The historic time period chosen for the analysis was one of unusually low
profitability on the part of LBs. Also, the LBs face a changed regulatory environment
following the recent withdrawal of government guarantees; they have reoriented towards new
business models in recent years, and their performance has improved considerably. Second,
the costs need to be contrasted with the LBs’ benefits (including their role in promoting local
economies), even if these are admittedly difficult to quantify.

6
26.
Furthermore, conflicts of interest on the part of supervisory authorities are not an
issue, contrary to staff suggestions. Owners and supervisors of the LBs are separate
institutional entities, the former being the Länder and regional savings banks, the latter being
federal agencies complying with the Basel Core Principles for Effective Banking
Supervision. Indeed, the FSAP certified the supervisory authorities a high degree of
independence and stated that political interference had not been considered to be an issue at
any time. This continues to be the case.
27.
The savings banks pillar of the German banking system continues to serve the
economy well. The savings banks play a key role in the financing of small and medium-sized
firms. This role continues to be usefully underpinned by the regional principle. In addition,
the mostly long-term orientation of savings banks’ business relationships is beneficial from a
stability perspective. Market trends with potentially procyclical effects have been followed
only to a lesser extent.
28.
The planned introduction of real estate investment trusts (REITs) in Germany will
promote flexibility in property markets. It will also broaden the range of investment vehicles
by complementing the existing open-ended real estate funds, given their different
risk-return-profiles. While the recent draft bill proposes to largely exclude the existing stock
of residential real estate, this restriction should not be overestimated. Experience elsewhere
shows that, despite the eligibility of residential real estate, markets for REITs are effectively
dominated by commercial property.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
December 14, 2006

International Monetary Fund
700 19th Street, NW
Washington, D. C. 20431 USA

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2006 Article IV Consultation with
Germany
On December, 6, 2006, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF)
concluded the Article IV consultation with Germany.1
Background
A cyclical recovery is underway with buoyant exports progressively spilling over into stronger
domestic demand. Investment activity is accelerating with high corporate profits and the long
contraction in the construction sector has bottomed out. Full-time employment has started to
pick up for the first time since 2001, but overall consumption still remains tepid with slow wage
growth.
GDP growth is projected to accelerate from 0.9 percent in 2005 to 2.5 percent in 2006 partly
benefiting from the World Cup, temporary fiscal incentives, and some durables purchases in
advance of the VAT hike. Growth is projected to slow to 1.5 percent in 2007, but the
deceleration is likely transitory. Downside risks to the outlook relate to volatile oil prices, global
monetary tightening, and if there were an abrupt unwinding of global imbalances. On the
positive side, growth could accelerate if the tick up in employment were to gain further speed,
thereby lifting household disposable incomes.

1

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On
return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the
Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the
Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the
country's authorities.

2

Labor productivity growth in the exposed manufacturing sector has improved steadily while
that in the more sheltered domestic economy trails international performance. Liberal
professions and crafts, and network industries, need to be further deregulated and reformed.
The financial sector has become healthier. Abundant liquidity and the cyclical upswing have
improved earnings of banks and insurance companies although bank profitability still
compares unfavorably with the EU average. Capital market activity has accelerated, led by
increased mergers and acquisitions. There is ample scope for further growth of capital markets
and in the large real estate sector which has stagnated for some time.
The government is making good progress in reducing the fiscal deficit. In 2006 the deficit will
drop below the 3 percent of GDP Maastricht limit one year ahead of the schedule under the
excessive deficit procedure. The reforms in health care and the corporate income tax system
remain under discussion. Germany’s long-term fiscal outlook is improving but aging-related
fiscal pressures still need to be reduced further.
Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors welcomed Germany’s brisk cyclical recovery, which has been aided by farreaching private sector restructuring and the authorities’ decisive actions on fiscal
consolidation. Directors welcomed the strengthening of investment and the early signs of a
pickup in consumption, indicating that exports are spurring domestic demand.
Directors encouraged the authorities to use the economic upswing to undertake deeper
structural reforms for raising Germany’s growth potential. External competitiveness is strong,
but the domestic sector needs to be strengthened through mutually reinforcing policies that
enhance labor utilization, boost productivity, and continue fiscal consolidation, thereby also
bolstering the sustainability of the welfare state.
Directors were encouraged by the resumption of growth in full-time employment. At the same
time, Directors stressed that a significant and durable reduction in unemployment will require
lowering reservation wages to bolster employment of lower skilled labor. Policies to increase
participation rates will also help reduce structural welfare costs.
Directors supported the authorities’ intention to strengthen the implementation of the Hartz IV
labor market reforms. They called for tightening eligibility for unemployment benefits for those
unwilling to work, and for cutting active labor market programs that are ineffective. Most
Directors urged the authorities to refrain from introducing minimum wages, which could
undermine job creation, and also cautioned against new wage subsidies. They also
encouraged the authorities to relax the employment protection legislation.
Directors called for further deregulation of the services markets, including for liberal
professions and crafts. They also saw a need to improve the contestability of markets in
network industries to boost efficiency and benefit consumers. Directors supported the
authorities’ initiatives to cut red tape and regulatory costs.

3

Directors underscored the importance of an efficient financial sector to improve the allocation
of capital to areas of highest return. While recognizing that earnings in the financial sector
have risen, Directors noted that performance still trails that of most EU peers. They welcomed
changes in the ownership structure of several public banks, but stressed that allowing a larger
role for private capital to facilitate restructuring remains vital.
Directors saw the ongoing review of the supervisory agency, BaFin, as a good opportunity to
buttress its operational independence. They endorsed the shift toward risk-oriented
supervision.
Directors noted that the continued deepening of capital markets—which are already playing an
increasing role in guiding corporate decisions—will be crucial for bolstering German growth
and employment. They welcomed the authorities’ intention to clarify the legal framework for
private equity and to introduce Real Estate Investment Trusts, which should cover both
commercial and residential property.
Directors welcomed the authorities’ strong expenditure-based measures for fiscal
consolidation, which will remain key to adjustment going forward. At the same time, they
viewed the increase in the VAT in 2007, combined with the cut in payroll taxes, as a key
structural measure that will help boost employment and strengthen the consolidation effort.
Directors encouraged the authorities to cut the structural deficit by around ¾ percent of GDP in
2007 and to eliminate it by 2010, in anticipation of the pressures of population aging.
Directors considered that Germany has made substantial progress in reducing long-term aging
costs, but cautioned that fiscal sustainability will not be assured even if the structural deficit
were to be eliminated by 2010. Accordingly, they encouraged the authorities to pursue a
broad-based approach, encompassing both fiscal adjustment and growth-enhancing reforms.
Directors welcomed the efforts to reform the corporate income tax and health care systems.
They urged the authorities to implement the reforms in a manner consistent with their stated
objectives of improving efficiency and lowering cost pressures without increasing fiscal risks.
On the corporate income tax, a reduction in tax rates largely financed by a broadening of the

care financing from payroll charges.

Directors observed that Germany has spurred internal competition within the euro area and
that new EU members have benefited from Germany’s proximity. They noted that further
successful reforms in Germany, as outlined above, would have positive spillover effects for the
region and the world.

Public Information Notices (PINs) form part of the IMF's efforts to promote transparency of the IMF's
views and analysis of economic developments and policies. With the consent of the country
(or countries) concerned, PINs are issued after Executive Board discussions of Article IV consultations
with member countries, of its surveillance of developments at the regional level, of post-program
monitoring, and of ex post assessments of member countries with longer-term program engagements.
PINs are also issued after Executive Board discussions of general policy matters, unless otherwise
decided by the Executive Board in a particular case. The Staff Report for the 2006 Article IV
Consultation with Germany is also available.
