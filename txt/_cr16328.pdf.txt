IMF Executive Board Concludes 2016 Article IV Consultation with the Republic of Palau
The Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded the Article IV
consultation1 with the Republic of Palau on September 9, 2016.
Palau’s economy has performed well in recent years. The economy grew strongly in FY2015
(ending September 30, 2015) at 9.4 percent, with tourist arrivals and construction activity
expanding by 35 percent. However, the rapid rise in tourism activity strained infrastructure and
was tilted towards low budget tourists, which led the authorities to limit the number of charter
flights in FY2016. Inflation declined to 2.2 percent in FY2015 in line with falling commodity
prices, and the external position improved due to lower commodity prices and higher tourism
receipts. The fiscal position strengthened because of spending restraint and strong revenue
growth, with the current fiscal deficit (current expenditure less domestic revenue) falling from
11 percent of GDP in FY2014 to 5.5 percent in FY2015. Public debt remains moderate and
sustainable.
The outlook for Palau is also favorable. Economic growth is expected to slow temporarily to zero
in FY2016 as tourist arrivals decline, but to rebound to 5 percent in FY2017 as tourism activity
recovers with the entry of new hotels and construction picks up. Inflation is projected to remain
low at 2 percent as commodity prices stabilize. The current account deficit is expected to rise due
to larger infrastructure related imports, and the fiscal position is projected to improve further on
continued spending restraint. Palau’s positive outlook is subject to substantial risks due to its
reliance on tourism, grants, and commodity imports. A slowdown in key trading partners, further
U.S. dollar appreciation, and natural disasters could hurt tourism activity. Higher commodity
prices could make food and fuel imports costlier. Failure to implement a strategy for sustainable
tourism development could reduce growth in the medium term. Palau will have to rely on fiscal
and structural policies should risks materialize.

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with members, usually
every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial information, and discusses with officials
the country's economic developments and policies. On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which
forms the basis for discussion by the Executive Board.

Executive Board Assessment2
The Executive Directors welcomed Palau’s robust economic growth and improved fiscal and
external positions, underpinned by a strong tourism industry and significant expansion in
construction activity. Directors noted that, while the outlook is favorable, the economy is subject
to downside risks arising from the exposure to natural disasters and climate change, and from its
heavy reliance on tourism and grants. They emphasized the importance of continued sound
macroeconomic policies and structural reforms to ensure fiscal sustainability, preserve financial
stability, and boost potential growth.
Directors welcomed the measures taken to strengthen the fiscal position. They underscored,
however, that additional efforts will be needed over the medium term to ensure fiscal
self-sufficiency when the Compact grants expire. Fiscal adjustment should build on the progress
made on revenue and expenditure measures, including by replacing the gross revenue tax with a
value added tax, and by reorienting infrastructure investment to support the tourism industry and
enhance the resilience to natural disasters and climate change. Directors highlighted the
importance of strengthening the fiscal framework by targeting a public sector net worth position
as the fiscal anchor, while using the current fiscal balance as an operational target. In addition,
they emphasized that improving public financial management and strengthening the civil service
pension system would help contain fiscal risks and ensure debt sustainability.
Directors noted that the banking system remains sound and well supervised and welcomed the
steps being taken to preserve financial stability and facilitate domestic credit expansion.
Directors encouraged continued efforts to relax the ceiling on credit rates and to broaden the
Financial Institutions Commission oversight to include non-bank financial institutions.
Directors emphasized that economic diversification and improving the business climate are key
to reducing Palau’s vulnerabilities and boosting potential growth. Priority should be given to
developing a comprehensive strategy to ensure sustainable tourism development, supported by
adequate infrastructure investment. Directors also encouraged the authorities to improve the
regulatory environment and to strengthen the coordination among the national and state
governments.

STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2016 ARTICLE IV CONSULTATION
August 24, 2016

KEY ISSUES
Context. Palau is a middle-income micro state in the Pacific (population: 18,000) that relies
heavily on tourism and grants, and is exposed to natural disasters. The economy grew
strongly at 9.4 percent in FY2015 led by robust tourism and construction activity, but the
surge in tourist arrivals strained infrastructure and was tilted to low budget tourism. The
fiscal position has improved, but further efforts are needed to ensure long-term fiscal
sustainability. The outlook is favorable although subject to significant downside risks. The
discussions focused on:
Ensuring long term fiscal sustainability


Further fiscal adjustment is needed to ensure self-sufficiency when the Compact grants
expire in FY2024. This should include both revenue and expenditure measures, with the
composition of expenditure tilted towards preserving infrastructure investment.



The fiscal framework should be boosted by targeting a public sector net worth position
as the fiscal anchor and using the current fiscal balance as an operational target.



Public financial management should be strengthened to limit fiscal risks. Some public
entities need to be reformed to limit their losses and reduce government subsidies.

Increasing potential growth and resilience


Protecting the environment and positioning Palau as a high-end tourism destination
requires adopting a broad strategy for sustainable tourism development, and limiting
hotel developments until infrastructure has been upgraded.



Appropriate infrastructure planning is needed to support the rapidly growing tourism
industry and enhance resilience to natural disasters and climate change.

Preserving financial stability and facilitating credit extension.


Banks remain sound and well supervised, but financial supervision should be extended
to other financial institutions. Staff welcomes the authorities’ plan to expand financial
supervision to the National Development Bank of Palau.



Banks continue to lend little domestically. Easing the interest rate ceiling on commercial
loans and helping small and medium size enterprises to prepare business plans would
help domestic financial intermediation.

REPUBLIC OF PALAU

CONTEXT
1.
Palau is a middle-income micro state in the Pacific that relies heavily on tourism and
grants, and is exposed to natural disasters and climate change. The country was hit by a severe
drought early this year associated with El Niño weather conditions, which led the authorities to ration
water consumption and declare state of emergency in March and April (Appendix I). Palau’s political
system is based on the U.S. model, the presidential term is four-year, and the next elections are in
November 2016. President Remengesau Jr. is well regarded for his environmental initiatives such as
the world's first shark sanctuary created in 2009 and the world’s largest marine sanctuary created in
2015 (Appendix II). Palau’s legal tender is the U.S. dollar and its fiscal year ends in September.
2.
Palau became independent in 1994 after being under U.S. administration. As part of
a 50-year Compact of Free Association, the United States provided US$580 million in financial aid to
Palau during 1994-2009 for infrastructure investment, budget support, and the establishment of
a Compact Trust Fund (CTF). The CTF, with an initial investment of US$70 million, was to provide
Palau with US$5 million in FY1999–09 and US$15 million in FY2010–44. But the CTF funds proved
insufficient and a new agreement extending financial assistance for another 15 years was signed in
2010. The new assistance included US$30 million for the CTF, US$122 million in current grants, and
US$67 million for infrastructure. However, the agreement has not been ratified by the U.S. Congress,
although Palau continues to receive current grants and CTF withdrawals. The projections below
assume that the agreement is ratified in FY2017, with the funds evenly disbursed during FY2018–24.
Palau would face a drop in government revenue after FY2024 when the Compact grants expire, but it
would continue to receive US$15 million in CTF withdrawals until the CTF is exhausted.
3.
Palau’s economic policies in FY2014-15 were broadly in line with past IMF advice
(Appendix III). The fiscal position has improved thanks to spending restraint, and a tax reform bill was
sent to Congress in FY2014, which is pending approval. Basic infrastructure and internet connectivity
are being upgraded through ongoing projects. Efforts to expand financial supervision to the National
Development Bank of Palau and other non-bank financial institutions are also underway.

CURRENT DEVELOPMENTS, OUTLOOK AND RISKS
4.
Growth. The economy grew strongly in FY2015 at 9.4 percent, significantly faster than other
Pacific island countries, with tourist arrivals and
construction activity expanding by 35 percent.
But the boom in tourism strained infrastructure
(water, sanitation, and waste disposal), was
tilted to low budget tourists, led to a rise in low
quality hotels, and put the environment at risk
(Appendix IV). As a result, the authorities have
limited the number of charter flights and
tourist arrivals have slowed in FY2016.
Construction was buoyant in FY2015 due to the
development of infrastructure and new hotels.

4

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

REPUBLIC OF PALAU

The recent drought had a limited impact on growth due to its short duration and the small size of
the agricultural sector. Growth is projected at zero in FY2016 due to lower tourist arrivals and a
modest impact from the drought, but to rise to 5 percent in FY2017 as tourism recovers with the
entry of new hotels and construction picks up. In the medium term, growth would gradually
moderate to 2 percent as hotel developments are restricted until infrastructure has been upgraded.
5.
Inflation and credit. In line with global trends, inflation fell to 2.2 percent in FY2015 as food
and fuel prices declined and it is expected at 2 percent in FY2016–17 as commodity prices stabilize.
Banks continue to lend little domestically despite the rapid rise in deposits, investing most of their
assets abroad. Domestic loans fell by 2.5 percent in FY2015, with the loan-to-deposit ratio declining
to 13 percent. The ceiling on lending rates for commercial loans and the lack of business plans and
financial statements for small and medium size enterprises (SMEs) are likely at the root of this issue.
6.
External Stability. The external position has improved. The current account deficit shrank
from 12 percent of GDP in FY2014 to 0.5 percent in FY2015, mostly due to a fall in fuel imports by
10 percent of GDP, but lower food imports and higher tourism receipts also helped. Capital grants
and FDI inflows exceeded the current account deficit by a wide margin. The current account deficit is
expected to rise to 7 percent of GDP in FY2016-18 due to higher imports relating to fiber optic cable
and sanitation projects financed with AsDB loans; and it is projected to stabilize at 5.5 percent of
GDP in the medium term due to higher commodity prices and infrastructure related imports financed
with Compact grants. These deficits would remain fully financed with capital grants and FDI inflows.
7.
Risks. Palau’s positive outlook is subject to substantial downside risks due to its high reliance
on tourism, grants, and commodity imports (Appendix V). U.S. dollar appreciation, a slowdown in key
trading partners, and natural disasters could hurt tourism. Higher commodity prices could make food
and fuel imports costlier. Further delays in ratifying the Compact agreement with the United States
could complicate financing of fiscal and external balances. A continued strong influx of low budget
tourists and further increase in low quality hotels could position Palau as a mass tourism destination
and thus hurt the environment. Failure to implement a tourism strategy and diversify the economy
could reduce growth in the medium term. Given the lack of monetary and exchange rate policies,
Palau’s policy tools would be limited to fiscal and structural policies should risks materialize.

Authorities’ views
8.
The authorities agreed with staff’s assessment of the economic outlook and risks. They
noted that their objective is to achieve a level of growth that is sustainable and consistent with their
goals of maintaining a pristine environment and positioning Palau as a high-end tourism destination.
In this regard, the surge in tourist arrivals in FY2015 was excessive as it strained infrastructure, was
tilted towards package tour low budget tourists, and led to an increase in low quality hotels. These
trends go against their goals, and justified the introduction of limits on charter flights and restrictions
in hotel developments until infrastructure has been upgraded. The authorities also noted that
although the increase in the airport departure tax from US$50 to US$100 per tourist from April 1,
2017 seeks to replace lost revenue from fishing licenses due to the creation of the marine sanctuary,
it may also help discourage tourist arrivals, particularly for low budget tourists. However, they expect
the impact of this measure on tourist arrivals to be limited.

KEY POLICY ISSUES
9.
Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). The authorities seek to achieve a number of SDGs
to make development economically, socially, and environmentally sustainable. The SDGs prioritized
by the authorities are: (i) Promoting sustained, inclusive and sustainable economic growth (SDG #8);
(ii) Building resilient infrastructure (#9); (iii) Combating climate change and its impacts (#13); and
(iv) Conserving the ocean and marine resources for sustainable development (#14). The key policy
priorities in this regard are ensuring fiscal sustainability, raising potential growth and enhancing
resilience, and preserving financial stability and facilitating credit extension.

A. Ensuring Fiscal Sustainability
10.
Developments. Palau’s fiscal position has improved noticeably. The current fiscal deficit
(expense less domestic revenue) fell from
11 percent of GDP in FY2014 to 5.5 percent
in FY2015. Tax revenue rose by 1 percent of
GDP due to higher receipts from the airport
departure tax as tourist arrivals soared,
while expense declined by 4.5 percent of
GDP due to spending restraint. The overall
balance rose only by 1.5 percent of GDP
due to a drop in grants. The CTF reached
64 percent of GDP in FY2015, while
government deposits rose to 8.1 percent of
GDP, domestic accounts payable fell to
5.4 percent of GDP, and government external debt declined to 10.4 percent of GDP.
11.
Medium-term outlook. Fiscal adjustment is set to continue due to sustained spending
restraint, with the current fiscal deficit falling from 5.5 percent of GDP in FY2015 to 4 percent in
FY2018. The current deficit would stay at 5.5 percent of GDP in FY2016 as the fall in tourism related
revenue is offset by spending restraint. From FY2017, domestic revenue would remain stable as
percent of GDP but for the rise in the airport departure tax from US$50 to US$100 per tourist from
April 1, 2017. This measure would raise 2.4 percent of GDP in revenue, half of which is reserved for
the Civil Service Pension Fund (CSPF) and is not reflected in the government accounts.1 Government
revenue would rise by 1.2 percent of GDP (0.6 percent in FY2017 and FY2018), but expense would
also rise by the same amount as the extra revenue is reserved for the state governments and marine
sanctuary, with no impact on the current fiscal balance. Spending restraint is expected to continue,
with the current fiscal balance falling by 0.7 percent of GDP in FY2017 and FY2018. Public investment
would be limited to that financed with capital grants and AsDB loans, with the overall fiscal balance

1

This extra revenue is estimated to reduce the CSPF’s unfunded liabilities from 39 percent of GDP in 2015 prior to the
reform to 8 percent after the reform. More generally, the fact that this large improvement in the fiscal position is not
reflected in the fiscal accounts highlights the need to expand the perimeter in the fiscal statistics to include the state
governments, the CSPF, the Social Security Fund, and the state owned enterprises.

temporarily moving into deficit due to higher capital spending funded with AsDB loans, but returning
into surplus afterwards due to the lower current fiscal deficits and higher Compact grants.
12.
Long-term outlook. The current fiscal deficit is expected to remain at 4 percent of GDP from
FY2018 onwards. Capital spending in FY2019-24 would continue to be set by capital grants and AsDB
loans, with the overall fiscal balance staying in surplus as the current grants exceed the current fiscal
deficit. As part of the FY2018-24 windfall is saved, the government’s net worth—defined as the CTF
plus government deposits, less domestic accounts payable, government external debt, and CSPF’s
unfunded liabilities—would rise from 48 percent of GDP in FY2015 to 59 percent in FY2024. The CTF
would fall to 51 percent of GDP in FY2014 due to the larger withdrawals allowed under the renewed
Compact agreement, while other government assets net would increase to 8.5 percent of GDP. Staff
analysis suggests that the current fiscal deficit can be sustained at 4 percent of GDP post FY2024,
provided that public investment is capped at 5.6 percent of GDP (Appendix VI). The overall fiscal
balance falls after FY2024 as the Compact grants expire, but the government net worth stabilizes at
59 percent of GDP as the rise in other government assets net offsets the decline in the CTF.
Palau: Long-term Fiscal Sustainability in the Baseline Scenario

Staff’s Reform Scenario
13.
Strengthening the fiscal framework. Staff recommends targeting a net worth position of
the public sector as the fiscal anchor, and using the current fiscal balance as the operational target.
Targeting a net worth level would ensure fiscal self-sufficiency when the Compact grants expire in
FY2024 by building sufficient government non-CTF assets to offset the decline in the CTF balance,
thus keeping ample buffers. Using the current fiscal balance as the operational target would not only
help achieve the desired government net worth position, but also reach a desired level of capital
spending by restricting the level of current expenditure relative to domestic revenue.
14.
Ensuring long-term fiscal sustainability. Staff recommends further fiscal adjustment in the
medium term and to shift the composition of public expenditure towards investment to support the
growing tourism industry and enhance resilience to natural disasters and climate change. In the
baseline scenario, public investment is only 6.2 percent of GDP in FY2019–24 and 5.6 percent of GDP
after FY2024—lower than Palau’s historical average (8.3 percent of GDP) and below that of other

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

REPUBLIC OF PALAU

Pacific islands (11 percent of GDP). Moreover, Palau needs buffers because: (i) tax revenue is volatile
given its reliance on taxes on tourism; (ii) the country is exposed to natural disasters and climate
change; (iii) there are contingent liabilities in the CSPF and other public entities; and (iv) the CTF and
other government assets are subject to market risk. Staff recommends targeting at government net
worth position of 70 percent of GDP after FY2024, 11 percentage points more than in the baseline
scenario. Staff also recommends cutting the current fiscal deficit to 1 percent of GDP by FY2020,
which would not only help achieve the government’s net worth target, but also increase public
investment to 8.3 percent of GDP from FY2019. Real GDP growth would fall in FY2017–18 due to the
fiscal adjustment, but it would increase in FY2019–21 as the gains from higher public investment
more than offset the negative impact from fiscal consolidation. After FY2020, growth would increase
by about 1 percentage point in line with the rise in public investment.
Palau: Long-term Fiscal Sustainability in Staff’s Reform Scenario

15.
Attaining a balanced fiscal adjustment. Further fiscal adjustment should rely on revenue
and expenditure measures. Staff supports a reform that replaces the gross revenue tax (GRT) with a
single rate value added tax (VAT) with no exemptions, and raises the net income tax on financial
institutions and all VAT-registered businesses. Staff also recommends strengthening tax compliance
and using a bidding mechanism to manage charter flights instead of quantitative limits. Expenditures
should be contained by prioritizing spending and gradually eliminating subsidies. Staff recommends
splitting the fiscal adjustment equally between revenue and expenditure measures. The VAT and net
income tax reforms could yield 1.5 percent of GDP in additional revenue by FY2020, while the wage
bill could be reduced by 1 percent of GDP and government subsidies by 0.5 percent of GDP.
16.
Strengthening public financial management (PFM). Robust PFM is key to contain fiscal
risks and support fiscal adjustment. Staff advises sound public debt management and project
administration to secure debt sustainability. Staff analysis shows that public debt remains sustainable
despite the recent AsDB loans by US$52 million to finance the upgrade of the Koror-Arai waste
management system and the submarine fiber optic cable (Appendix VII). However, public debt
remains highly sensitive to a real GDP growth shock such as those that Palau could experience if
faced with large natural disasters. Staff also recommends prioritizing infrastructure that supports

REPUBLIC OF PALAU

tourism growth and resilience to natural disasters and climate change, adopting a medium-term
budget framework, improving budget execution and planning, and strengthening cash management.
17.
Reforming public entities. Some public entities need to be reformed. The Civil Service
Pension Fund (CSPF) is estimated to have unfunded liabilities by 8.3 percent of GDP even after
considering the extra revenue from the increase in the airport departure tax. Staff recommends
reducing benefits and raising contributions to ensure its long-term sustainability. The Palau Public
Utility Corporation (PPUC) relies on government subsidies for its provision of water services. Staff
advises raising tariffs and lowering operational costs to ensure full cost recovery of its operations,
while providing adequate protection to the most vulnerable. The other two state owned enterprises,
the Palau National Communications Corporation and the Belau Submarine Cable Corporation, have
been able to cover their costs with their own revenue, without requiring government support.

Authorities’ views
18.
The authorities welcomed staff’s recommendation to strengthen the fiscal framework
and analysis of long-term fiscal sustainability. They noted that the recommendation of further
fiscal adjustment in the medium term is well aligned with their own goal of self-financing expense
with domestic revenue (zero current fiscal balance) by FY2024. They also welcomed staff advice of
replacing the GRT with a VAT and rising the net income tax for financial institutions and all VATregistered businesses. They noted that a bill replacing the GRT with a VAT was sent to Congress in
FY2014, but has not yet been approved. They also stressed ongoing efforts to strengthen PFM and
the medium term budget framework. The authorities also acknowledged the existence of unfunded
liabilities in the CSPF, and noted that a bill shifting the CSPF from a defined-benefit to a definedcontribution system was sent to Congress in FY2014, but has also not yet been approved. They
stressed that this reform would ensure the long-term sustainability of the CSPF, with the new funds
from the increase in the airport departure tax used to pay for the benefits during the transition. The
authorities also want to make PPUC self-sufficient by rising tariffs and reducing costs. However, they
noted that service quality needs to be improved in line with planned upgrades to the water system
before tariffs can be raised.

20.
Achieving sustainable tourism development. Tourism remains Palau’s main growth
engine, but the lack of a tourism policy and weak regulation have led to excessive growth of the low
budget segment. To align tourism development with the authorities’ long-term goal of positioning
Palau as a high-end tourism destination, staff recommends implementing a comprehensive tourism
strategy that clearly outlines land zoning rules, protects the environment, regulates service quality,
has adequate infrastructure planning, and improves the skills of the labor force. Several initiatives in
this direction have been tried in the past, but lack of political will, limited resources, and coordination
problems have limited their implementation (Appendix VIII). New tourism developments in Koror
should be avoided until infrastructure has been upgraded, but developments outside Koror and
green tourism could continue. The regulatory environment also needs to be strengthened to
enhance scrutiny and enforcement of regulations. Better coordination among the national and state
governments is necessary to ensure effective implementation of the authorities’ long-term vision.
21.
Diversifying the economy. Economic diversification would help reducing volatility and
broadening the sources of growth. To lower tourism volatility, the mission recommends promoting
tourism from new destinations, including growing Asian markets. Developing domestic business
activities that can supply the tourism industry such as agriculture and aquaculture, and tourism
activities that would increase tourist spending, would also help diversify the sources of growth.
22.
Improving the business environment. A strong business environment would help private
investment growth. Palau foreign investment approvals are decided by a Foreign Investment Board,
which operates in a case by case basis. Staff recommends adopting a new foreign investment regime
to simplify investment approval and open all business to foreign investment through joint ventures
provided that proper regulations are in place. Staff also supports the role of the Economic Advisory
Group—which includes representatives of the government, Congress, and the private sector—in
coordinating the dialog between the private and public sectors to improve policy formulation and
planning, including on measures to improve Palau’s business environment.
23.
Enhancing infrastructure. Infrastructure bottlenecks are limiting tourism growth. The recent
surge in tourism strained water supply, sanitation, and waste disposal, while poor internet quality has
been the main dissatisfaction of Palau’s visitors in tourist exit surveys. These bottlenecks will ease as
the projects funded with AsDB loans and capital grants are completed, but appropriate infrastructure
planning as part of a broader tourism strategy is needed. New infrastructure should also seek to
increase resilience to natural disasters and climate change, which is a significant risk as the recent
drought showed. Priorities include limiting developments in areas at risk of tropical storms and rising
sea levels, and improving the water system. Staff welcomes the authorities’ plans to upgrade the
water pipeline system in Koror and to broaden the sources of water to make it more stable.

Authorities’ views
24.
The authorities concurred with staff on the need to implement a comprehensive tourism
strategy consistent with the long-term view of making Palau a high-end tourism destination and
keeping a pristine environment. They noted that the bureau of tourism is preparing a plan along
these lines, which should be finalized in the coming months. They also agreed that new hotel
developments in Koror should be avoided until infrastructure has been upgraded, although they are
open to high-end hotel developments that build their own treatment plants. The authorities agreed
with staff on the need to prioritize infrastructure that helps tourism growth and resilience to natural

disasters and climate change. On the latter, they highlighted a new project financed with grants from
Japan to upgrade the water pipeline system in Koror, which should reduce leakages and make water
distribution more efficient. In addition, they are evaluating different alternatives to broaden the
sources of water to avoid shortages such as the one experienced during the recent drought.

C. Preserving Financial Stability and Facilitating Credit Extension
25.
Context. Palau’s banks remain sound, with nonperforming loans at 2.1 percent, liquid assets
at 90 percent, and return on assets at

NDBP will be regulated by the Financial
Institutions Commission (FIC) and will be subject to the same regulations of commercial banks. The
loss of correspondent banking relationships has not been an issue in Palau as the three foreign
owned U.S. FDIC insured banks do all the international transactions in the country. Anti-money
laundering investigations have also improved with the enhanced role of the Financial Intelligence
Unit (FIU).
26.
Preserving financial stability. Keeping a sound financial sector is key to mitigate risks. The
FIC has improved bank examinations, data collection, and reporting; while the FIU has enhanced antimoney laundering investigations. Staff recommends broadening the FIC’s supervision to all non-bank
financial institutions, including credit unions, and encourages the legislators to approve the Credit
Union Act that put all credit unions under FIC supervision. Staff also welcomes the authorities plan to
put the NDBP under FIC supervision, subject to the same regulations of commercial banks, while
allowing it to take deposits and expand its lending activities. The authorities are also encouraged to
continue improving the AML/CFT regime in line with the FATF standard.
27.
Facilitating credit extension. To mobilize domestic credit, staff advises relaxing the interest
rate ceiling for commercial loans to better reflect riskiness, and helping SMEs prepare business plans
and financial statements. The NDBP can also help fill the financing gap for SMEs, especially in the
agriculture sector. The NDBP lending activities have been constrained by the availability of financing
from international financial institutions, and limited to the areas for which these funds are targeted,
including agriculture, aquaculture, and housing. Once the NDBP is licensed to take deposits, it will be
able to expand its lending activities to other areas of the economy.
28.
Improving statistics. Palau’s statistics are broadly adequate for surveillance thanks to
technical assistance from IMF PFTAC and the Graduate School USA. Staff recommends improving
tourism statistics and strengthening the statistics office to continue improving data quality.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

11

REPUBLIC OF PALAU

Authorities’ views
29.
The authorities agreed with staff’s assessment that Palau’s banks remain sound. They
noted that deposits have increased rapidly, which should help banks keep high profit levels. They
also acknowledged that banks continue to lend little domestically, investing most of their assets
abroad. They noted that the number of individuals loans has increased significantly, but the total
loan stock has fallen because of the repayment of some large commercial loans. The authorities also
observed that commercial lending has not picked up partly because foreign investors do not require
domestic financing for their investment projects, but instead bring their own funds. The authorities
are not convinced that the limit on lending rates to commercial loans is a key constraint to domestic
credit growth. They believe that the lack of business plans and financial statements for SMEs is a
more important factor. The authorities expect that the NDBP will help closing the financing gap for
SMEs once it starts taking deposits and expanding its lending activities. However, it may take a few
years for the NDBP to satisfy all the FIC’s requirements to be licensed as a deposit taker. The
authorities welcomed staff’s advice to broaden FIC supervision to all financial institutions and
appreciated staff’s support to get the Credit Union Act passed in Congress.

D. External Sector Assessment
30.
Palau’s external sector is broadly in equilibrium. Although the real effective exchange rate
appreciated by 22 percent between FY2011 and FY2015, in line with the strengthening of the U.S.
dollar, the current account deficit has fallen reflecting lower commodity prices and strong tourism
receipts. Looking ahead, the U.S. dollar is expected to strengthen further as the Fed rises policy rates
and Palau’s current account deficit is projected to increase somewhat due to higher commodity
prices and infrastructure related imports. But these deficits would remain fully covered by FDI inflows
and capital grants, suggesting that Palau’s external sector is broadly in equilibrium.2 However, heavy
reliance on tourists from a few countries is a vulnerability, and weaknesses in infrastructure and
investment climate could hinder development of tourism businesses. Therefore, strengthening fiscal
consolidation and improving competitiveness by improving infrastructure and the business climate
are essential for maintaining. external stability going forward. The use of the U.S. dollar as Palau’s
legal tender remains appropriate as it provides an important nominal anchor.
31.
Government deposits, as a measure of foreign reserves, remain appropriate covering
2.7 months of spending, including debt service. Fully dollarized economies may need liquidity
buffers in U.S. dollars to support domestic financial institutions, to repay short-term external debt,
and as a buffer for government financing.3 For Palau, the first two arguments are not very relevant.
The liquid asset ratio in the banking sector is high at 90 percent, and Palau does not borrow shortterm externally, with all of its external debt being long-term with international organizations.
However, government revenue volatility is a risk. A useful rule of thumb for the minimum size of
fiscal reserves is one month of spending. Palau’s government deposits in FY2015 stood at 8.1 percent

Data gaps impede a more robust external sector assessment for Palau, such those based on the IMF’s External
Balance Assessment (EBA) model or the IMF’s EBA-Lite model.

of GDP or 2.7 months of government spending, well above the minimum requirement. Moreover,
they are projected to increase to about 6 months of spending by FY2021.
Palau: Key External Sector Indicators

Authorities’ views
32.
The authorities agreed with staff’s external sector assessment, and noted that the current
account deficits are expected to remain lower than in the past, with FDI inflows and capital grants
fully covering them. Moreover, government deposits are projected to increase in line with fiscal
consolidation, thus providing additional buffers.

STAFF APPRAISAL
33.
Palau’s economy has performed well in recent years and the outlook is favorable. Real
GDP growth has been robust, inflation has been low and stable, and the external and fiscal positions
have improved. The outlook is positive, with growth temporarily declining to zero in FY2016 due to
lower tourist arrivals, but rebounding to 5 percent in FY2017–18 as tourism activity recovers and
construction activity picks up. Inflation is expected to remain low due to stable commodity prices,
while the current account deficit would rise due to larger infrastructure related imports. The fiscal
position would improve further due to continued spending restraint.
34.
This positive outlook is subject to large downside risks. Further U.S. dollar appreciation, a
slowdown in key trading partners, and natural disasters could hurt tourism. Higher commodity prices
would make food and fuel imports costlier. A continued strong tourist influx could position Palau as
a mass tourism destination and hurt the environment. Given the lack of monetary and exchange rate
policies, Palau would need to rely on fiscal and structural policies should risks materialize.
35.
The fiscal framework should be strengthened by targeting the public sector net worth
as a fiscal anchor and using the current fiscal balance as an operational target. This framework
would not only help ensure fiscal self-sufficiency when the Compact grants expire in FY2024, but also
increase public investment and keep ample buffers for future contingencies.
36.
Further fiscal adjustment is needed to ensure fiscal sustainability. The authorities have
made significant progress in improving Palau’s fiscal position in recent years. However, further fiscal

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

13

REPUBLIC OF PALAU

adjustment is necessary over the medium term to ensure fiscal self-sufficiency when the compact
grants expire in FY2024. This adjustment should rely on both revenue and expenditure measures, and
the composition of government expenditure should be shifted towards infrastructure investment.
37.
The fiscal adjustment should be complemented with reforms to fiscal institutions and
public entities. Strengthening public financial management is key to support fiscal adjustment and
maintain fiscal discipline. Sound public debt management and project administration would help
secure debt sustainability and contain fiscal risks. Staff advises reforming the CSPF to eliminate its
unfunded liabilities, and restructuring the PPUC to ensure full cost recovery of its operations and
reduce the need for government subsidies.
38.
Implementing a comprehensive tourism strategy is key to achieve sustainable tourism
development. Tourism remains Palau’s main growth engine, but the recent surge in tourist arrivals
strained infrastructure and was tilted towards low budget tourists. This goes against the authorities’
goal of positioning Palau as a high end tourism destination and is a threat to the environment. Staff
welcomes the authorities’ plans to implement a comprehensive tourism strategy that sets clear rules
for sustainable tourism development. Staff also recommends avoiding new hotels developments
until infrastructure has been upgraded, improving the regulatory environment, and strengthening
the coordination among the national and state governments.
39.
Diversifying the economy would help reducing volatility and broadening the sources of
growth. Staff recommends promoting high end tourism from new destinations, including growing
Asian markets, developing domestic business activities that can supply the tourism industry such as
agriculture and aquaculture, and stimulating activities that would increase tourist spending.
40.
Infrastructure development is needed to support the growing tourism industry and
enhance resilience to natural disasters and climate change. Infrastructure bottlenecks are limiting
tourism growth, highlighting the need for appropriate infrastructure planning as part of a broader
tourism strategy. Infrastructure investment should also aim to increase resilience to natural disasters
and climate change, including by limiting developments in areas at risk of tropical storms and rising
sea levels, and improving the water system to avoid shortages in the future.
41.
Improving the business climate would support private sector investment. Staff advises
adopting a new foreign investment regime to simplify investment approval and open all business
activities to foreign investment through joint ventures. Staff also supports the coordinating role of
the Economic Advisory Group in the dialog between the private and public sectors to improve policy
formulation and planning, including on measures to improve the business climate.
42.
Preserving financial stability and increasing domestic credit would support private
sector activity. Palau’s banks remain sound, but continue to lend little domestically. Staff welcomes
the authorities’ plans to broaden the FIC’s supervision to the credit unions, and advises relaxing the
interest rate ceiling for commercial loans to better reflect riskiness, and helping SMEs prepare
business plans and financial statements. Staff also welcomes the authorities’ plan to put the NDBP
under FIC supervision, subject to the same regulations of commercial banks, while allowing it to take
deposits and expand its lending activities more broadly in the economy.

It is recommended that the next Article IV consultation take place on a 24-month cycle.

Appendix I. Risks of Natural Disasters
The Pacific island countries are among the most exposed to natural disasters in the world. Their
location and small size make them vulnerable to earthquakes and tsunamis, and weather-related
disasters such as cyclones, droughts, and floods (IMF 2015). But Palau has been less affected than
other Pacific island countries in the past. Figure 1.1 shows that among 12 Pacific island countries,
Palau had the lowest average number of natural disasters per year during 1960-2014, and the lowest
probability of occurrence of natural disasters calculated over 1970-2014. Still, the Pacific Catastrophe
Risk Assessment and Financing Initiative estimates a 50 percent chance that Palau could experience
large losses (US$30 million or 10 percent of GDP) due to natural disasters in the next 50 years.

This year, Palau was hit by one of the strongest droughts in its history due to El Niño weather
conditions. A report from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Agency in March 21, 2016 placed
Palau in extreme drought level 3 of 4, with the cumulative rainfall in the previous four months at the
lowest level since 1951. The two main sources of water had been declining since late 2015, and the
Ngerimel Dam, which provides 80 percent of water consumption in normal times, was shut down in
April. As a result, the government restricted water consumption to three hours a day since March 29.
This restriction was lifted in May 9 when the weather conditions normalized.
The recent drought showed the need for fiscal buffers and investment to make infrastructure more
resilient to natural disasters and climate change. The government’s plan for this emergency included
importing drinking water and water test kits, improving water distribution in some areas, buying
medications in case of disease outbreaks, and promoting public awareness. The cost was estimated
at US$3 million (1 percent of GDP). Going forward, Palau will need to broaden its sources of water,
especially because of unpredictable weather conditions due to climate change and the rapid growth
in water demand due to the expanding tourism industry. Alternative options include developing
underground water sources, enhancing water storage facilities, and using desalination plants for sea
water. Palau’s government deposits, currently at 8.1 percent of GDP, are insufficient to finance the
response to potentially large natural disasters with losses close to 10 percent of GDP as estimated by
the Pacific Catastrophe Risk Assessment and Financing Initiative.

making conservation vital. The PMNS will lower
fishing rights revenue, but this will be offset by
giving all revenue from fishing agreements and
a part of the environmental impact fee
(US$12.5 per tourist) to the state governments.
Sala and others (2013) find that the value of
well-enforced marine reserves in adjacent
fishing and tourism exceeds the pre-reserve
value. Looking at sharks alone, Vianna and
others (2010) estimate that a reef shark has
a life-time value of US$1.9 million through dive
tourism, compared to US$10,800 if it were
fished. Tourist appreciation of Palau’s protected marine life is also clear in tourist expenditure
patterns, where diving is the third largest expense item.

Surveillance and funding. Palau’s Ministry of Natural Resources, Environment and Tourism (MNRET)
manages the PMNS, oversees foreign fishing agreements, issues fishing permits, monitors fish stocks
and harvests within the DFZ, and coordinates enforcement. The Fisheries Protection Trust Fund
(FPTF) was established under the National Treasury to fund surveillance, enforcement and related
trainings. All fines, forfeiture proceeds, and part of the environmental impact fee (US$10 per tourist)
are remitted to the FPTF. The government is also exploring a potential of debt-for-nature swap that
would allow Palau to divert loan payments to activities that support the PMNS. Regional partners
also fund Palau’s surveillance. Going forward, Palau released a 2016–2021 monitoring, control and
surveillance (MCS) plan that will aid in fighting illegal activities and fishing violations in Palau’s EEZ.
The MCS plan also aims to improve Palau’s search and rescue, pollution detection, weather
forecasting, and resilience to climate change.

Appendix III. Staff Policy Advice, 2014 Article IV Consultation

Policy Actions
Fiscal Policy

Replenish the fiscal buffers by containing current
spending and saving any additional revenue gains.

The authorities contained current spending growth in
FY2014−15, with expense decreasing from 36 percent of
GDP in FY 2013 to 31 percent in FY2015. In addition,
2 percent of GDP on extra revenue were also saved. As a
result, the current fiscal deficit declined by 8 percent of
GDP between FY2013 and FY2015.

Strengthen fiscal consolidation over the medium
term through comprehensive tax reform and
expenditure reform to achieve fiscal self-sufficiency
when the Compact grants expire in FY 2024.

The authorities sent a tax reform bill to Congress in 2014,
but it is still pending approval. They have achieved a
significant reduction in current spending in recent years.
However, further fiscal adjustment is need to ensure fiscal
self-sufficiency.

Improve public financial management to strengthen
the budget framework and ensure debt
sustainability.

The authorities have made progress in improving public
financial management, including by improving the
timeliness of their data collection and audits. Public debt
remains sustainable.

Continue reforming public entities to contain fiscal
risks and reduce government subsidies.

The Palau Public Utility Corporation relies on government
support, but the authorities plan to reform it to make it
sustainable. The unfunded liabilities of the Civil Service
Pension Fund were sharply reduced with the additional
revenue earmarked from the recently legislated increase in
the airport departure tax.

Financial Market Policy
Broaden financial regulation and supervision to
include the National Development Bank of Palau
(NDBP) and other non-bank financial institutions.

The legislation allowing the NDBP to take deposits was
passed in Congress and once licensed, the NDBP will be
regulated by the Financial Institutions Commission (FIC)
and will be subject to the same regulations of commercial
banks. The draft Credit Union Act that put all credit unions
under FIC supervision was submitted to Congress in
FY2014, but it has not yet been approved.

Structural Policies
Diversify the sources of growth, including within and
outside the tourism industry.

There has been limited progress on economic
diversification. Tourism remains the main growth engine,
and the composition of tourist arrivals have become more
concentrated in a few countries.

Expand basic infrastructure such water and
sanitation system to promote development of new
hotels and raise tourism growth.

The authorities secured two loans from the AsDB to
upgrade the Koror-Arai waste management system and to
connect to a submarine fiber optic cable. In addition, Palau
Japanese government will provide a grant to upgrade the
water pipelines in Koror. These projects, when completed,
will ease some of the infrastructure bottlenecks.

Adopt a new foreign investment regime to simplify
investment approval and open all business activities
to foreign investment through joint ventures.

Foreign investment approvals continue to be decided by a
Foreign Investment Board that operates in a case by case
basis. Limits to foreign ownership in key areas remain.

Appendix IV. Tourism Developments
Tourist arrivals surged by 34 percent in FY2015, with the bulk coming from China. Chinese tourists
accounted for 54 percent of total arrivals,
followed by Japanese (19 percent) and
Taiwanese (9 percent). This contrasts with
profile in 2009-14, when Chinese tourists
accounted for 5 percent, while Japanese and
Taiwanese accounted for 35 and 27 percent.
High concentration of tourists from one
country poses a risk the tourism industry, with
potentially disruptive consequences for Palau if
outward Chinese tourism flows were to decline.
The change in profile of tourist arrivals has
altered expenditure patterns and visitor
activities. The surge in tourists in 2015 led to a sharp rise in total visitor spending on
accommodations, but receipts from the gross revenue and hotel taxes have not risen as fast,
reflecting a shift to low-cost hotels (Figure 2). Occupancy rates of Chinese-based hotels rose from
44 percent in 2010 to 81 percent in 2015, with Chinese tourists spending US$87 on average per
room, less than Japanese and Taiwanese tourists who spend US$160 and US$150 respectively.
Spending on boat tours also rose, while diving expenditures declined. Boat tours, which cater to
a bigger number of tourists per trip, tend to have a higher impact to the environment and lower
gains per tourist compared with diving activities. More generally, tourism revenue per arrival
declined to US$3,987 in 2015 from US$4,749 in 2014.
Palau: Tourism Developments and Tax Revenue

Recent tourism developments highlight the need for Palau to act on its national tourism strategy
before the pristine environment and the quality of tourist experience deteriorate. The limits on
charter flights and the legislated rise in the airport departure tax are concrete policies undertaken to
address the growing capacity constraints in the tourism sector. However, a comprehensive tourism
strategy is needed to ensure the sustainability of Palau’s main growth engine.

The Risk Assessment Matrix (RAM) shows events that could materially alter the baseline path (the scenario most likely to
materialize in the view of IMF staff). The relative likelihood is the staff’s subjective assessment of the risks surrounding the
baseline (“low” is meant to indicate a probability below 10 percent, “medium” a probability between 10 and 30 percent, and
“high” a probability between 30 and 50 percent). The RAM reflects staff views on the source of risks and overall level of concern
as of the time of discussions with the authorities. Non-mutually exclusive risks may interact and materialize jointly.

Appendix VI. Long-Term Fiscal Sustainability Analysis
Palau can sustain a current fiscal deficit at 4 percent of GDP after FY2024 if public investment is set at
a low 5.6 percent of GDP. Staff recommends reducing the current fiscal deficit to 1 percent of GDP from
FY2020 to increase public investment to 8.3 percent of GDP, while keeping ample buffers.
The analytical framework is based on the government’s intertemporal budget constraint. This
framework requires that the government’s net worth plus the net present value (NPV) of future
revenue equals the NPV of future expenditure as follows:
W+G+R=C+K
where the government’s net worth (W), and NPVs of grants (G) and domestic revenue (R) are
balanced against the NPVs of fiscal expense (C) and capital spending (K).
The current deficit (C-R) and capital spending are endogenous, while the government’s net worth
and grants are exogenous. The government’s net worth is inherited and is equal to the Compact
Trust Fund (CTF) plus government’s deposits, less domestic accounts payable, government’s external
debt, and unfunded liabilities of the Civil Service Pension Fund (CSPF). Grants are determined by the
donors and the Compact agreement. In contrast, capital spending and the current deficit are chosen
by the policymakers to satisfy the government’s intertemporal budget constraint. In the baseline
scenario, capital spending is chosen after FY2024 for a given current deficit. In the reform scenario,
the current deficit is chosen to achieve a desired level of capital spending.
The government’s net worth in FY2015 was 48 percent of GDP, with the CTF balance at 64 percent of
GDP, government deposits at 8.1 percent of GDP, domestic accounts payable at 5.4 percent of GDP,
government external debt at 10.4 percent of GDP, and unfunded liabilities in the CSPF at 8.3 percent
of GDP. The following assumptions were used in the baseline scenario:

• Nominal GDP growth is 3 percent in FY2016, 7.6 percent in FY2017, 7.1 percent in FY2018,
6.1 percent in FY2019, 5.1 percent in FY2020, and 4 percent thereafter.

• The CTF nominal rate of return is 6.5 percent, slightly higher than the 5.8 percent obtained
during FY2000-15, but lower than the 7.3 percent attained during FY2009–15.

• U.S. Compact grants total US$124 million in FY2018–24 (total direct assistance of US$229 million
minus advances of US$105 million received during FY2010–17).

• The CTF withdrawals are US$5 million in FY2016–17, increasing gradually after to US$13 million
in FY2023, and US$15 million from FY2024 onwards. The CTF is exhausted in FY2082.

• Other U.S. grants total US$184 million in FY2016–24 and 5.4 percent of GDP thereafter, while
other country grants total US$ 104 million in FY2016–24 and 2.8 percent of GDP thereafter.

Baseline Scenario
Capital spending in FY2016-24 is set by the existing AsDB loans and capital grants (compact and
other), averaging 11 percent of GDP in FY2016–18 and 6 percent in FY2019–24. After FY2024, capital
spending is set to satisfy the government’s intertemporal budget constraint while keeping the
current fiscal deficit at 4 percent of GDP from FY2018 onwards. The results show that the current
deficit can be sustained at this level if public investment is capped at 5.6 percent of GDP after FY2024

(Figure 3.1). The government’s net worth stabilizes at 59 percent of GDP after FY2024 as the increase
in other non-CTF government assets net offsets the fall in the CTF. Current and capital spending are
financed with domestic revenue, investment income, CTF withdrawals, and non-compact grants.
Figure VI.1 Baseline Scenario: Main Fiscal Aggregates

Palau needs more infrastructure investment to support its rapidly growing tourism industry and to
enhance its resilience to natural disasters and climate change. A public investment rate of 5.6 percent
of GDP is lower than Palau’s historical average (8.3 percent of GDP) and that of other Pacific island
countries (11 percent of GDP). Palau also needs buffers as: (i) tax revenue is volatile given its reliance
on taxes on tourism; (ii) the country is exposed to natural disasters and climate change; (iii) there are
contingent liabilities in the CSPF and other public entities; and (iv) the CTF and other government
assets are subject to market risk. For example, the CTF lost 5 percent of its value (3.5 percent of GDP)
in FY2015 due to global financial volatility. Thus, staff recommends further cuts to the current fiscal
deficit to allow for higher public investment and higher buffers as discussed below.

Reform Scenario
Staff recommends targeting a government net worth of 70 percent of GDP after FY2024 as the fiscal
anchor, and cutting the current fiscal deficit to 1 percent of GDP from FY2020 as the operational
target. In the reform scenario, capital spending in FY2016-18 is kept the same as in the baseline
(11 percent of GDP in average), but it is increased to 8.3 percent of GDP from FY2019. The increase in
capital spending makes it equal to its FY2000-15 average, and is motivated by the need to sustain

REPUBLIC OF PALAU

tourism growth and make infrastructure more resilient to natural disasters and climate change. As a
result, real GDP growth increases by 1 percentage point after from FY2020. The current fiscal deficit is
chosen to ensure enough funding for the increased level of capital spending. The results show that
cutting the current fiscal deficit by 1.1 percent of GDP each year in FY2017-20 to 1 percent from
FY2020 onwards would allow raising public investment to 8.3 percent of GDP from FY2019, while
achieving the government net worth target of 70 percent of GDP after 2024, thus keeping ample
buffers (Figure 3.2). As in the baseline scenario, government current and capital spending would be
financed with tax revenue, investment income, CTF withdrawals, and non-compact grants.
Figure VI.2 Reform Scenario: Main Fiscal Aggregates

Medium-term fiscal adjustment should rely on both revenue and spending measures. Staff supports
a tax reform that replaces the gross revenue tax (GRT) with a single rate value added tax (VAT) with
no exemptions, and raising the net income tax for financial institutions and all VAT-registered
businesses. Staff also recommends cutting expense, especially government consumption and
subsidies, which account for about half of total expense. In the reform scenario, broadly half of the
medium-term fiscal adjustment is achieved through higher revenue, and the other half through cuts
to government’s consumption and subsidies.

Appendix VII. Public Sector Debt Sustainability Analysis
Palau’s public debt remains sustainable despite the recent AsDB loans by US$52 million to fund the
upgrade of the Koror-Arai waste management system and the submarine fiber optic cable, which will
be disbursed gradually during FY2014-20. Staff uses a broad definition of public debt in its analysis,
including the central government’s external debt (10.4 percent of GDP in FY2015), the government’s
domestic accounts payable or domestic arrears (5.4 percent of GDP in FY2015), and the SOEs’ debt,
which is fully guaranteed by the government and is a contingent liability (11.6 percent of GDP in
FY2015). Staff’s baseline scenario projects that the public debt will fall from 27.3 percent of GDP in
FY2015 to below 20 percent in FY2021. Most of this decline is due to the large primary surpluses
during FY2018-21 and the positive growth-interest rate differential.
One key element in the analysis is that Palau does not have access to private foreign capital markets.
All of Palau’s external debt is from international organizations for specific projects, and thus there is
no direct link between the fiscal balance and debt issuance in the private debt market. The baseline
scenario’s public debt projections assume that the central government and SOEs do not take new
foreign loans during FY2016-21, and thus the debt stock declines in line with the amortization of
past loans. The path of public debt could be less favorable if the government or the SOEs take on
new debt in the coming years. The central government’s debt stock increases temporarily during
FY2016-18 due to the disbursements from the recent AsDB loans, but it declines afterwards. As the
primary balances and flows from the growth-interest rate differential in FY2016-21 are larger than
those required to pay for the debt service, the government uses the surplus to fully repay its
domestic arrears and to build government deposits. If the primary balances and flows from the
growth-interest rate differential were insufficient to cover for the debt service, public debt could rise
in the form of larger domestic arrears, as it happened during the global financial crisis.
The alternative scenarios highlight the recent improvements in Palau’s fiscal position. The historical
scenario, in which GDP growth, real interest rates, and primary balances are equal to their FY2006‒15
averages, leads to higher public debt and gross financing needs than in staff’s baseline scenario. The
scenario with a constant primary deficit at the projected FY2016 level of 1.9 percent of GDP also
leads to higher debt-to-GDP ratios and gross financing needs than in staff’s baseline scenario. The
alternative scenarios also highlight the sensitiveness of the public debt-to-GDP ratio to a growth
shock. A decline in real GDP growth by 5.5 percentage points in FY2017-18 would increase the public
debt-to-GDP ratio by 13 percent of GDP by FY2018, with the debt ratio declining by FY2021 to levels
similar to that of FY2016. This result also highlights the sensitiveness of Palau’s public debt to large
natural disasters, which not only could cause a decline in growth of this magnitude, but also lead to
larger government expenditure for relief and reconstruction.

Appendix VIII. Tourism Strategy
Palau has developed several tourism strategies over the years, including those laid out in the Tourism
Action Plan (2008), the Presidential Management Action Plan (2001), the Study for Promotion of
Economic Development in the Republic of Palau (2000), Sustainable Tourism Policies and Action Plan
(1997), the 2020 National Master Development Plan (1996), the National Environmental Management
Strategies (NEMS) (1994), and the Economic Development Plan (1994). The most recent one formed
part of the 2009-2014 Medium Term Development Strategy which set out key strategies and actions
for economic, social, environmental and cultural goals over the five-year period. Under the plan, the
tourism strategy is to position Palau as an island of choice for environmentally conscious visitors and
realize higher returns from tourism. Some of the key actions identified under the strategy are:


Clarify organizational roles, including those of the Palau Visitors Authority (PVA), the Chambers of
Commerce, and the Belau Tourist Association.



Align the government agenda with that of tourism agencies.



Position Palau on the world tourism marketplace, through more targeted marketing as a high-end
destination, by fostering ecotourism, and developing new attractions.



Increase investment into quality accommodation and encourage product upgrades.



Improve air access by making adjustments to bilateral air service agreements.



Create partnerships for environmental management of key tourism resources.

The actions identified in the current strategy are not new nor different to those set out in previous
strategies. The aim to distinguish Palau as a high end destination, promote sustainable tourism and
improve management of natural and cultural resources have been regular features of the various
strategies since 1994. However, progress on achieving these objectives has been slow. A range of
factors explain the slow progress, but the authorities’ failure to press ahead with implementation,
allocate sufficient resources to advance reforms, and ensure policy consistency across government
are important factors holding back progress. A lack of political will has also been cited as a factor,
although confusion on the way forward has also been mentioned.
The separation of legislative powers among the states and the national government is another key
obstacle to implementing the national strategy. While the national government controls the overall
strategy on tourism and development, it is the state governments that control the implementation of
certain policies within their states. This poses difficulties for the federal government to implement
the overall national tourism strategy across all the states, particularly as not all states share the same
vision of the national strategy.
The recent influx of tourist arrivals has posed further stress on the national strategy. Various agencies
have noted that both the state and federal government have been in reacting to developments in
tourism rather than proactively pursuing policies, for instance, the restrictions on charter flights and
Koror State’s moratorium on hotel development were implemented to limit development of package
tourism. The authorities’ concern has been that the rise in package-tourism is not consistent with the
‘high-end destination’ objective under the tourism strategy.
However, there is a lack of clarity among government and tourism agencies on the definition of
‘high-end’ tourism and the most effective policies to achieve that goal. Agencies are generally
INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

35

REPUBLIC OF PALAU

confused whether ‘high-end’ implies higher spending per day or whether they would like target
tourists from certain destinations. Furthermore, government and tourism agencies appear to be
working against each other. For instance, while the PVA has been marketing Palau as a high-end
destination, there have been several low-quality and budget hotel establishments under construction
in Koror. While the authorities point to a number of loopholes in existing legislation, particularly on
hotel development, purchases of land-leases, and regulations, there has been little in the way of
addressing the weaknesses in the legislative and regulatory frameworks to ensure that developing
trends in the tourism industry are consistent with the overall national strategy.
That said, there has been notable progress on some areas of the tourism strategy, in particular, to
preserve Palau’s marine assets. In 2009 Palau established the world’s first shark sanctuary banning
any form of commercial fishing of sharks. Later in October, 2015, Palau’s congress approved the
Palau National Marine Sanctuary Act to establish one of the world’s largest protected areas of ocean,
and protect Palau’s key tourism resources. This are welcome developments, although greater efforts
are needed to make progress on the other areas of the national tourism strategy.

IMF–WORLD BANK COLLABORATION
(August 2016)
The World Bank and IMF teams for the Republic of Palau led by Mr. Robert Utz (Lead Economist) and
Mr. Guajardo (IMF Mission Chief for Palau) maintain a close working relationship and dialogue on
macroeconomic and structural issues.
Palau’s reliance on tourism, grants and commodity imports pose risks to the economy. In turn, Palau
will need to rely on fiscal and structural policies to help mitigate potential risks such as a slowdown
in key trading partners, further U.S. dollar appreciation, natural disasters, and higher commodity
prices. Against this backdrop, the teams agreed that Palau’s key macroeconomic challenge is to
enhance resilience and lift potential growth in the medium term. Based on this shared assessment,
the teams identified key areas of reforms as follows: (i) securing fiscal sustainability; (ii) raising
potential growth and enhancing resilience; and (iii) ensuring financial stability and facilitating credit
extension.
To this end, the World Bank is currently supporting the government of Palau in undertaking reforms
and investments aimed at improving access to Information and Communications Technology (ICT). A
Technical Assistance Grant, signed in September 2013, provides advisory support and capacity
building needed to support ICT sector reform and liberalization in Palau. Furthermore, under Phase II
of the Pacific Regional Connectivity Program, an investment in telecommunications infrastructure is
under preparation. This could entail support for a fiber-optic submarine cable in order to increase
the availability and reduce the cost of international bandwidth and hence facilitate the rollout of
faster-cheaper broadband Internet.

RELATIONS WITH THE ASIAN DEVELOPMENT BANK
(August 2016)
After joining the Asian Development Bank (AsDB) in December, 2003, as its sixty-third member
country, Palau was classified as an AsDB developing member country in December 2005. AsDB has
since approved 6 loans totaling US$69.8 million and six technical assistance projects totaling
US$3.8 million. Cumulative disbursements to Palau for lending and grants financed by Ordinary
Capital Resources (OCR), the Asian Development Fund (ADF), and other special funds amount to
$17.7 million.
Country Operations and Business Partnership (COBP) 2016-2018 attaches high priority to provide
support to improve public sector effectiveness, facilitate private sector development, deliver safe
water and sanitation services, and improve connectivity.
Regional connectivity is vital for Palau’s development. In December 2015, AsDB approved lending of
US$25 million for the North Pacific Regional Connectivity Investment Project. The project will
increase broadband access in Palau by supporting the development of a submarine fiber-optic cable
system to link Palau to an internet cable hub in Guam.
Also in 2015, AsDB provided technical assistance to help the Government of the Republic of Palau
generate policy options for tourism development.
AsDB assistance was also given to develop a medium-term budget framework that has enabled the
government to plan more effectively, improve tools for fiscal management and deficit reduction, and
better implement development plans. AsDB has built upon these initiatives by helping the
government prepare its Medium-Term Development Strategy and provided support for Palau to
conduct a household income and expenditure survey in 2014.
To improve access to business credit, AsDB has provided technical assistance for new secured
transaction legislation. The government has launched a secured transaction registry, making it
possible for banks to provide loans with greater security, and at reduced risk.
AsDB has also supported improvements to governance in Palau’s state-owned enterprises (SOEs),
facilitate business growth by improving business registration systems, and develop an SOE policy
that will eventually include relevant legislative measures.
AsDB support for sustainable health care financing was extended in 2013, with AsDB assistance
covering the cost accounting of all health services in Palau. Also in 2013, AsDB released the second
tranche of a program loan for a series of technical and infrastructure projects. These projects support
Palau’s economic growth by improving public health, environmental protection, and basic water and
sewerage services. AsDB approved a project to upgrade the sewerage network in Koror and Arai,
which will directly benefit about 70 percent of the population, while helping to cater to the growing
tourism market.
No lending pipeline for Palau is proposed in the COBP, 2016–2018 as the government will focus on
project implementation. There is a proposed allocation of US$500,000 for technical assistance.

RELATIONS WITH THE PACIFIC FINANCIAL TECHNICAL
ASSISTANCE CENTRE (PFTAC)1
(August 2016)
Palau has been a heavy user of PFTAC technical assistance (TA) in recent years. In phase IV
(FY2012–16) there were 24 missions, with the largest concentration in the Revenue Sector. Other results
achieved in phase IV included revenue compliance strategies and strengthened bank supervision
through the adoption of regulations, improved bank reporting, and the establishment of an on-site
supervision program. Methodologies for producing a broader range of national income and balance of
payments statistics were also developed.
Strategy 2014–16
PFTAC’s TA strategy is guided by the APD regional strategy note and is planned within the results
framework for the current PFTAC (Phase IV) FY2012–16 funding cycle.2
PFTAC TA aims to support the authorities sustain progress on fiscal consolidation and strengthen the
financial sector. Priorities will be strengthening revenue administration and, in close coordination with
AsDB, improving PFM. Continued strengthening of financial sector supervision will also be required.
Macroeconomic statistics will continue to be developed mainly via annual sub-regional workshops.
In the public financial management area, the focus will be on continuing to support AsDB’s project
on developing medium-term budgeting. PFTAC in 2013 assisted Palau to undertake a PEFA SelfAssessment. Officials from Palau have regularly attended PFTAC's PFM workshops including most
recently its workshops on Medium-term Expenditure Forecasting (November 2015) and Social Security
Finance Reform (April 2017).
In the tax policy and revenue area anticipated reforms to the current tax system, including the
implementation of a VAT, have not materialized due to the Senate Ways and Means Committee unable
to secure a majority vote. However, PFTAC recommendations to strengthen revenue administration
were accepted by the authorities and resulted in: (a) the development of a new strategic and business
plan which highlights the most important objectives to be achieved over the next three years; and
(b) Ministerial approval to implement a new function based organizational structure. Budget clearance
to secure additional resourcing requirements is underway and new staff position descriptions being
negotiated with the Bureau of Public Service System.
In the financial sector supervision area, prudential returns are now implemented, and Palau is in line
for the integration of the Financial Sector Information System (FSIS) developed by the Reserve Bank of
New Zealand to be performed in late 2014. In June 2016, the Commission hosted the annual meeting

PFTAC is a regional technical assistance institution operated by the IMF with financial support of the AsDB, Australia, Japan, Korea and
New Zealand. The Centre’s aim is to build skills and institutional capacity for effective economic and financial management that can be
sustained at the national and regional level. Member countries are Cook Islands, Federated States of Micronesia, Fiji, Kiribati, Marshall
Islands, Nauru, Niue, Palau, Papua New Guinea, Samoa, Solomon Islands, Tokelau, Tonga, Tuvalu, and Vanuatu. It is based in Suva, Fiji.

of the Association of Financial Supervisors of Pacific Countries, for which PFTAC is the secretariat.
Capacity building in risk based banking supervision will continue including workshops for management
on how to manage in a risk based environment.
In economic statistics, PFTAC will continue to provide technical assistance for the development of GDP
estimates by expenditure and will assist with capacity building in national accounts statistics (RBM code
4.1) to further embed independent production skills. IMF HQ will provide resources to produce better
current and capital accounts of the balance of payments (RBM codes 4.6-4.8) and government finance
statistics.
In the macroeconomic analysis and frameworks area, PFTAC will provide TA on developing the
methodology used to forecast revenues focusing on planned tax reform measures. In addition, TA will
also be provided to develop capacity to assess alternative fiscal consolidation options for preserving
fiscal/debt sustainability when the Compact grants expire in FY2024.

STATISTICAL ISSUES
STATISTICAL ISSUES APPENDIX
(As of August 24, 2016)
Assessment of Data Adequacy for Surveillance
General: Palau’s statistics have improved during the past years and are now broadly adequate for
surveillance. With the support of technical assistance (TA) from IMF/PFTAC and the Graduate
School USA, the Office of Planning and Statistics (OPS) compiles and publishes macroeconomic
data at an annual frequency. The 2012-14 Palau Statistical Yearbooks that provides comprehensive
data on macroeconomic indicators, population, employment, housing, education, health,
investment, tourism, and other economic indicators has been published on Palau’s website
(http://palaugov.pw/executive-branch/ministries/finance/budgetandplanning/rop-statisticalyearbooks/). Further areas for improvement include broadening the coverage and providing more
frequent reporting, particularly of fiscal and external sector data. The OPS has recruited more staff
but continues to rely heavily on external consultants and TA. Further improvements in capacity and
additional TA are needed to strengthen the quality and timeliness of macroeconomic data.
National Accounts: Since 2012, GDP estimates by production have been compiled and published,
and the methodology has improved. Further areas of improvement include incorporating the
recent business surveys and compiling GDP estimates by expenditure.
Price Statistics: Data quality has improved and the Consumer Price Index has been regularly
published on a quarterly basis on Palau’s website (http://palaugov.pw/executivebranch/ministries/finance/budgetandplanning/consumer-price-index-cpi/).
Government Finance Statistics (GFS): Fiscal data are compiled using GFSM2001 classification
and were published in the 2012-14 Palau Statistical Yearbooks. Further improvements include
broadening the coverage beyond the central government and improving the frequency and
timeliness of reporting, including of the audited accounts. The authorities have recruited new staff
to compile GFS data and to participate in regional training and remote TA from STA. Annual GFS
data have not been reported to STA.
Monetary and Financial Statistics (MFS): The monetary survey is unavailable since there is no
central bank. Moving ahead, an MFS TA could assist the authorities in developing the standardized
report forms for the depository corporations and strengthening data reporting.
Financial sector surveillance: Banks have submitted quarterly financial statements, including
balance sheets and profit and loss statements, to the Financial Institutions Commission (FIC) since
2009. The FIC publishes financial soundness indicators (FSIs) and balance sheet data on a quarterly
basis (http://www.ropfic.org/). However, the FSIs do not include data from the National
Development Bank of Palau as it remains outside the FIC’s supervision.
External sector statistics: The balance of payments and international investment position are
reported according to BPM6 and published in the 2012-14 Palau Statistical Yearbooks. The
Business Enterprise Survey and the Hotel Accommodation Survey and Tourist Expenditure Survey
are expected to improve data quality, particularly tourism-related data. The financial accounts data
have also improved, resulting in a reduction of errors and omissions.
Data Standards and Quality
Palau began participating in the General Data Dissemination System in
August 2013, and comprehensive information on Palau’s statistical
production and dissemination practices are available on the IMF website.

Statement by Barry Sterland, Executive Director of Palau, and Ronald Cafrine,
Advisor to the Executive Director of Palau
September 9, 2016

Mr. Sterland and Mr. Cafrine submitted the following statement:
We thank the Fund and staff for the constructive discussions during the 2016 Article IV
consultation and a very useful staff report. We largely agree with staff views expressed in
the report, which effectively highlight the government reform efforts, as well as the
remaining challenges to preserve macroeconomic stability and ensure long-term growth. The
authorities remain highly appreciative of the valuable technical assistance provided by the
Fund, including under PFTAC, and anticipate continued engagement and support.
Palau, is a small middle-income island state in the North Pacific, with a narrow production
base and heavy reliance on tourism and grants. As such, the economy is both highly
vulnerable to natural disasters as well as external economic shocks. To ensure
macroeconomic stability, the government is determined to build adequate buffers against
downside risks, address structural impediments to growth and maintain prudent
macroeconomic policies. Given the inherent challenges faced by Palau, my authorities are
very grateful for the continued assistance from the international community, in particular the
United States which has been providing financial support through the Compact of Free
Association.
Economic Development and Outlook
The economy expanded by close to 9½ percent in 2015, driven by a massive increase in
tourist arrivals and a significant expansion in construction activity. This brought both
positive and negative effects. While beneficial for short-run economic growth, the
unexpectedly large increase in tourists, concentrated in Koror State, strained the limited
infrastructure base of the island. This, in turn, raised concerns about long-run sustainability
and, if unmonitored, Palau’s reputation as a pristine tourist destination could be at risk from
a degraded environment.
The authorities, in recognition of these pressures, announced a few measures to
safeguard the tourism sector’s long-run sustainability while still supporting economic
activity. In the short-term, the authorities limited the number of charter flights, as well as
imposing restrictions on new hotel developments in Koror State unless that development
meets certain environment and infrastructure standards (including its own water, sewerage
and electricity). Furthermore, to help relieve the pressure on Koror’s infrastructure, while still
supporting tourism and economic activity, tourism investments outside of Koror are exempt
from these restrictions. Over the medium- and long-term, Koror’s infrastructure will be better
able to handle private sector development as the authorities are scaling up infrastructure
investment. The authorities are committed to implementing a comprehensive tourism

strategy that both preserves the fragile environment and lays the basis for a soundly based
long-term growth.
While the outlook remains positive, growth is expected to be flat in 2016 owing to the
expected temporary decline in arrivals following these restrictions before accelerating
in 2017 and 2018. Our authorities are confident that growth will quickly rebound as new
hotels and infrastructure are brought on line together, achieving the authorities’ objective of
high long-term growth, and consistent with staff’s economic growth forecasts. Likewise, the
authorities agree that downside risks to the outlook predominate and recognize that risk
mitigation measures are limited to fiscal and structural policies in the absence of monetary
and exchange rate policies. As such, the authorities remain intent on building fiscal buffers
(see below). They are also actively considering how to diversify the economy, especially given
the current infrastructure bottlenecks as well as the longer-term risks associated with climate
change.
Fiscal Sustainability
The authorities agree with staff on the necessity for additional medium-term fiscal
adjustment to ensure fiscal self-sufficiency, especially after the US Compact grant ends
in 2024. In 2015, commendable fiscal discipline brought expenditure savings of 4.5 percent
of GDP, which helped lower the deficit significantly. At the same time, revenues increased by
about 1 percent of GDP.
The authorities will continue to build fiscal space over the medium-term. This will
involve careful decisions to ensure that the authorities reach both their goal of a zero current
fiscal balance by 2024 and are able to continue to invest in public investment to support the
tourism industry and enhance the country’s resilience to natural disasters. To achieve this
outcome, the authorities will build on existing progress with new revenue measures,
including through increasing the existing airport departure tax in the short-term and, in the
medium-term, more comprehensive tax reform that is projected to mobilize over 4 percent
of GDP in additional revenue. This will be supported by the careful monitoring of investment
projects to avoid fiscal slippage, and expenditure constraint (itself supported by improved
implementation of Public Financial Management (PFM) principles).
Staff views with respect to potential contingent liability risks from the Civil Service
Pension Fund (CSPF) and the SOEs were also acknowledged by the authorities. The
authorities have taken steps to correct the large unfunded liabilities within the CSPF, with the
Congress already considering legislation that will improve the sustainability of the system.
The authorities are considering cost recovery strategies for SOEs and are committed to
removing subsidies once service quality has been adequately upgraded. In the meantime,
planned investment to improve water distribution are underway.
Banking and Financial Sector Stability

Palau’s banking system remains strong and resilient, with banks well capitalized and
liquid, with a low non-performing ratio of about 2 percent. The presence of three
U.S. FDIC-insured banks is the back-bone of the banking system in Palau, holding 93 percent
of the loans and 99 percent of the deposits. With regards to supervision, the Financial
Institutions Commission (FIC) continues to enhance its capabilities through technical
assistance and training from the Fund, while the Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU) has also
improved its ability to undertake anti-money laundering investigations. The authorities are
pleased that de-risking, which poses a real threat in other pacific island countries, has been
assessed and reported by staff not to be a problem in Palau, owing to the three U.S. banks
doing the majority of transactions. The authorities continue to undertake efforts to improve
businesses’ access to credit. This includes advisory services working with applicants to
improve their business plans and financial statements, as well as the Development Bank
taking a more active role in providing credit to smaller borrowers.
Growth and Private Sector Development
The authorities remain committed to improving the business environment to allow the
private sector to play a larger role in economic activity. To this end, the authorities are
focused on reducing impediments to setting up new businesses which will improve investor
confidence and lift potential growth. In this area, the ADB and other development partners
continue to provide useful assistance, assisting the Government’s development agenda to
improve infrastructure and reduce business costs. The government, and these development
partners, are also ensuring that all new infrastructure projects undergo assessments of their
resilience to natural disasters and climate change. However, the challenges faced by the
authorities are structural in nature and common with other small states. This underlines the
importance of continued assistance and taking a long run view on these reforms.
The recently established Economic Advisory Group (EAG) – comprising both public and
private sector representatives – underlines the importance that the Government places
on promoting private sector development. Whilst the focus for the short-term will be to
ensure that the country continues to benefit through tourism growth that is environmentally
sustainable, the EAG would be addressing pertinent policy and structural matters with the
objective of attracting investment and boosting private sector development.
