Staff Report for the 2010 Article IV Consultation

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
The authorities’ aggressive measures have helped gain policy credibility and stabilize the
economy. The authorities have pressed ahead with the implementation of the National Asset
Management Agency (NAMA)—to transfer distressed property development and commercial
real estate assets from the books of banks—and have initiated a process of banks’ capital
enhancement. Ambitious fiscal consolidation is proceeding as planned. The policy credibility
has partially insulated Ireland from market pressures. Following near free fall in late 2008 and
early 2009, the economy is stabilizing and growth is expected to resume this year.
Recovery prospects are weighed down by the ongoing correction of pre-crisis imbalances.
Exports offer the most promising source of sustained recovery provided the gains in
competitiveness continue. But the relatively low domestic value-added of the most dynamic
exports and their high capital intensity imply that the spillovers to domestic growth and
employment will be limited. The decline in domestic price levels is needed to restore
competitiveness but, in the interim, creates deflationary demand risks. Current policy efforts to
boost banks’ capital ratios will help, but deleveraging and banks’ risk aversion will constrain
lending, at least in 2010–11. Along this narrow path to stability and recovery, unforeseen fiscal
needs and at times heavily bunched banks’ funding needs could generate unwelcome pressures.
Financial sector and fiscal policy require long-haul efforts with active risk management
to preserve policy credibility. Orderly disposal of NAMA’s assets will help restore the
commercial property market, distress of economically-vulnerable homeowners requires
attention, and the banking sector itself needs reshaping to a new strategic vision and business
model. Reflecting the lessons of the crisis, the ambitious ongoing redesign of the regulatory
and supervisory system will be hobbled without a special bank resolution framework.
Together, these efforts will facilitate a gradual exit from the government’s guarantee of bank
liabilities. The authorities’ planned fiscal consolidation will require sustained implementation
and, if insufficient to reach their goals, should be supplemented by additional measures. A
stronger fiscal framework would guide consolidation as the crisis-induced urgency abates.

I. RETAINING CREDIBILITY1
1.
Through assertive steps to deal with the most potent sources of vulnerability,
Irish policymakers have gained significant credibility. Measures to stabilize the banking
sector and achieve substantial fiscal consolidation have demonstrated the authorities’ resolve
to alleviate short-term risks while beginning to tackle their considerable long-term
challenges. These actions have reassured the global policy community and international
financial markets. The precipitous fall in Irish banks’ stock prices has abated. Over the past
months, Irish sovereign bond spreads have tended to rise significantly on the days of
intensely adverse international market sentiment but otherwise Ireland has been accorded the
space to pursue its planned policy trajectory.

However, the path from crisis to stability and recovery is a narrow one. With
some reversal in the earlier loss of competitiveness and improvements in the global economy,
exports will lead the recovery. But spillovers to the domestic economy will be limited
because of exports’ heavy reliance on imports, their tendency to employ capital-intensive
processes, and the sizeable repatriation of profits generated by multinational exporters.
Moreover, the unwinding of home-grown imbalances from the boom years—arising from
rapid credit growth, inflated property prices, and high wage and price levels—will create
deflationary tendencies that act as a drag on growth. Banks remain a source of downside risks
from higher than expected losses, uncertainties in global regulatory trends, and continued
financial market tensions that restrict access to funding.

Along the long-haul path to normalcy, retaining policy credibility will require
demonstrated commitment and active risk management. The appropriately ambitious

fiscal consolidation plan demands years of tight budgetary control. Likewise, the weaning of
the banking sector from public support and its eventual return to good health will proceed at
only a measured pace. In the interim, unforeseen fiscal demands may occur. In this context,
at times heavily bunched banks’ funding needs and episodes of market volatility could
generate unwelcome pressures and disruption. With limited fiscal resources for dealing with
contingencies, maintaining a steady policy course will require mechanisms for oversight and
transparency, and high-quality communication to minimize risks and sustain the political
consensus and market confidence.

Economic contraction continued through 2009. Following a precipitous fall
in 2008:Q4, the pace of decline moderated. The economy appeared to stabilize in 2009:Q3,
but a q-o-q contraction of 2.3 percent in the final quarter reflected continued underlying
weaknesses. For the year, Irish GDP fell by 7.1 percent, reflecting a decline in domestic
consumption and investment, particularly construction. Exports declined, but the import
contraction was larger, so net exports contributed positively. GNP—income to nationals—
fell by 11.3 percent, more steeply than did GDP since the foreign multinationals held up
better than the domestic sector.

The extended weakness reflects not just
cyclical contraction but structural changes that are
reversing past excesses. Pre-crisis growth depended
heavily on the construction and financial sectors, which
increased their share of GDP to more than 15 percent.
In a reinforcing process, housing and commercial
development relied on rapid credit growth, leading to

credit-to-GDP ratio. In the contraction, that process worked in reverse: increased
unemployment and loss of consumer confidence contributed to further weakening of property
prices and the banking sector.
6.
The economy is projected to resume growth in 2010. Short-term indicators present
a mixed picture of prospects. After a sharp rise in January, industrial production has pulled
back. Goods exports are recovering from a weak performance in the second half of 2009.
Sentiment measures have also shown improvement, but they incorrectly predicted a much
stronger 2009:Q4 and do not as yet reflect the recent financial market tensions. Recent
unemployment data were disappointing. Consequently, likely outcomes are in a larger than
usual zone of uncertainty. Even as the economy recovers through the year, staff projects the
GDP for 2010 to be ½ percent lower than in 2009, but with a q4-on-q4 increase of about
2 percent. The authorities have not recently updated their official projections but see scope
for a larger cyclical rebound in 2010–11.

Ireland’s openness makes it subject to spillover risks. As a borrower and creditor,
Ireland is deeply connected to international financial markets. It, therefore, is subject to
international shocks, while also being a potential source of shocks with international
implications. Greece’s prolonged vulnerability reduced the element of surprise, leading to

6
relatively modest spillovers. Irish policy credibility also helped. The Greek exposure of Irish
banks covered by the government’s guarantee is small.2

According to the Bank for International Settlements, Irish-based banks’ exposure to Greece was $8.5 billion
(3½ percent of GDP) at end-2009, but this refers predominantly to banks in the International Financial Services
Center. The exposure of Irish banks covered by the government’s guarantee is of the order of €40 million.

Box 1. Unemployment in Ireland
The unemployment response to the recession has been greater than predicted by
historical patterns. On the basis of Okun’s law, the “unexplained” increase in
unemployment over 2008–09 is 1.6 percentage points. Weakness in the labor market is
also reflected in discouraged Irish workers who have left the labor force in large
numbers, absent which the unemployment rate would have been higher.

Labor participation fell mainly among the younger population. Since the young are
likely to return to the labor force as the economy recovers, the unemployment rate will
tend to remain high. The fall in participation among older males is more of a concern
since they may find it increasingly difficult to return to work.

III. THE STRENGTH AND SHAPE OF THE RECOVERY
10.
The pace of recovery remains constrained by continuing imbalances. Staff
projects that GDP growth will gradually recover to 3½ percent by 2015. This modest pace of
recovery is due to a decline in potential growth that predates the crisis but was accentuated
by it (Box 2). By staff’s estimates, the potential growth rate will rise gradually to about
2½ percent by 2015 as the internal imbalances—arising from rapid credit growth, overvalued
property prices, and high price and wage levels—are corrected (Figure 1). The analysis
cautions that the Irish economy may be in a regime with the relatively-modest potential
growth and the high unemployment reinforcing each other. The authorities recognize these
dislocations but are more optimistic about the medium-term growth prospects. They judge
that the traditional flexibility and international openness of the Irish labor market will
provide a self-correcting mechanism towards more robust growth.
Box 2. Potential Output Growth after the Crisis
By 2007, Irish GDP growth had become unsustainable. Three different estimation
methods suggest that the output was above potential by 5–7 percent in 2007. The
collapse in output since then has taken it below potential, with estimates of the 2009
output gap ranging from -3½ to -7 percent.
Ireland’s potential growth had been declining before the crisis and has been
temporarily further reduced. The pre-crisis slowdown in the potential growth rate
reflected a maturing of the economy and the absence of new sources of sustainable
growth. Following the crisis, lower investment rates, the fallout of the banking crisis,
and higher structural unemployment have further dampened the growth potential. Staff
sees potential growth rising from the current 1 percent to about 2½ percent, closing the
output gap by 2015.

A. An Export-Led Recovery?
11.
Irish exports fell less in the recent global downturn than did exports elsewhere.
While German export volumes fell by 14¼ percent in 2009, the contraction of Irish exports
was only 2¼ percent. A large chemicals’ export base helped as global chemicals’ trade,
particularly of pharmaceuticals, held up even as another traditional Irish export, office
machinery, fell sharply. Set against weak domestic demand, exports will likely lead the
recovery. The question is whether exports will create a new dynamic that raises the economy
to a higher performance trajectory.
While exports of of fice machinery declined, those

Irish export dynamics have been tied to inward foreign investment.
Multinationals, particularly from the United States, substantially raised their presence in
Ireland in the late 1990s, linking Ireland to global supply networks of electronics and
chemical products. This engagement in global supply chains was aided by wage moderation
in the 1990s and by an educated labor force. Ireland’s export-to-GDP ratio rose. But, given
the heavy import content of the exports, so did the import-to-GDP ratio. U.S. multinationals
use Ireland as a base for exports to European markets, and about two-thirds of Irish exports
are destined for Europe.
Exports are mainly to the euro area, UK

Even before the crisis hit, the rapid rise of Irish wage levels and increasing
global competition had diminished traditional Irish advantages. The departure of Dell, a
large manufacturing employer, to Poland in early 2009 was symbolic of a loss of edge in
low-end manufacturing. Ireland’s share of the value of global and European manufactured
exports, which had risen sharply between 1995 and 2001, fell steadily thereafter. In recent
years, export growth has been sustained, though at lower levels than in the 1990s, by the
repositioning of Ireland as a service exporter and “knowledge hub.”
Exports of services continued to grow at a fast pace, but
exports of good grew much slower .

The recent decline in unit labor costs from their high levels will need to be
sustained to close the competitiveness gap and make a material difference to growth
prospects. The CGER estimates suggest that the real effective exchange rate is broadly in
line with medium-term fundamentals. However, the high Irish price and wage levels will
require a period of “internal devaluation” over the next few years to support export growth.
Nominal private sector wages rose to new heights through the end of 2008 before hourly
wages started declining in early 2009. For now, however, unit labor costs have fallen
primarily because of improvements in labor productivity. In turn, the productivity increase
reflects mainly compositional shifts in the labor force as the relatively-unproductive
construction industry has contracted. Thus staff was concerned that productivity increases

12
may not continue and, hence, the decline in unit labor costs to competitive levels is not yet
assured. The authorities expect wage compression to continue on account of continuing
weakness in and flexibility of the Irish labor market.

While stressing recent improvements in competitiveness, the authorities agreed
that the short-term prospects of Irish exports depend largely on partner country
growth. Given the structure of exports, the authorities were mindful that narrow measures of
competitiveness were insufficient. They viewed the recent depreciation of the euro as helpful
and the gains in unit labor costs as a necessary, though not a sufficient, condition for export
growth. Partner country growth is important, but the focus of Irish exports on Europe is not
helpful. Among major trading blocs, Europe is recovering at the slowest pace. By staff’s

The decline in prices reflects the high Irish price levels prior to the crisis and the
collapse in domestic demand. Despite Ireland’s extensive trade relationships with the U.K.,
the depreciation of the British pound relative to the euro does not, in staff’s view, appear to
be a primary source of the price decline. Irish import prices seem to have fallen after goods
prices. Rather, Irish price levels were substantially higher than eurozone price levels prior to
the crisis, mainly reflecting higher services prices but also higher goods prices (possibly

14
because of the domestic distribution component). The ongoing fall in domestic demand
implies that the adjustment to eurozone price levels will continue in the short term.

Real interest rates have risen sharply. In the
boom years, Irish prices were rising more rapidly than
average eurozone prices. This implied that real interest
rates were especially low—and supported the boom.
Following the crisis, there has been a tendency for
countries with prior low real interest rates to flip to
high real rates as they had greater imbalances to
unwind. Ireland is an extreme example of this reversal.

Real interests were low in Ireland during the boom,
but are now higher than in other countries

Given the sharp increase in leverage, this will be a drag on the pace of recovery.
In order to achieve the required internal devaluation, some fall in Irish prices is
necessary. However, in the transition to lower price levels, deflation will slow the pace of
recovery. The debt of households and businesses, fueled by the low real interest rates before
the crisis and with unchanged nominal values, has now to be repaid in an environment of
falling prices, higher real interest rates, and low GDP growth rates. These factors lead staff to
conclude that the normally-sharp bounce back to close the output gap after a large output
decline will be muted on account of the deflationary drag.

As banks emerge from the worst phase
of the crisis, they remain weak. While capital
ratios of the eurozone banks have risen since the
crisis, they have declined for the large Irish banks.
Banks’ reliance on wholesale funding—and,
hence, high loan-to-deposit ratios—has yet to be
corrected significantly. The ratio of nonperforming
loans (NPLs) to all loans increased from ¾ percent
at end-2007 to 9 percent at end-2009 and can only
be expected to increase further, particularly if
rescheduled loans fall into arrears. In the
meantime, the ability to provision for these NPLs
has declined sharply.

24.
In response to constrained capital and liquidity, banks have tightened credit
standards. Banks’ credit standards for firms have tightened continuously since mid-2007.
Standards for mortgage and consumer credit, having tightened, are stabilizing. Staff analysis
shows that as Irish banks become weaker, credit standards tighten, restricting credit (Box 3).
The observed decline in the net flow of credit is, thus, consistent with tighter lending
standards. The authorities rightly noted that credit demand had also fallen, and banks were
reporting that they were currently limited by lack of good lending prospects. Staff and the
authorities agreed that distinguishing supply and demand effects was difficult and staff
analysis was cautionary regarding the ability of the banks to lend for a recovery.

Box 3. Macro-Financial Linkages
Banks’ health is an important determinant of their willingness to lend. For Ireland,
the statistical evidence suggests that the ratio of bank stock prices relative to the overall
stock market—a proxy for bank health—helps explain bank lending standards. A fall
of 0.5 in this ratio is estimated to cause a gradual tightening of consumer and corporate
lending standards by about 1/3 and 1, respectively, on a scale between one and five (one
denotes a considerable tightening of standards and five a considerable easing).
Bank lending standards have an important effect on different types of credit. The
average quarterly tightening of lending standards in Ireland during the latest tightening
cycle has been approximately 0.1. Such tightening is estimated to cause credit
contraction of 0.15 percent of GDP for consumer loans and 0.5 percent of GDP for
mortgage and corporate loans. Relative to the gross new lending that occurred in the
last quarter of 2009, this corresponds to about 5 percent of consumer loans, 3 percent
of mortgage loans and 1 percent of corporate loans.
Credit availability matters for consumption and investment decisions as well as
house prices. An increase in consumer credit of one euro is associated with increased
consumption of 80 cents with a one-quarter lag and a further 80 cents after one year. A
corporate loan of one euro is associated with increased investment of 30 cents
contemporaneously and an additional 40 cents after three quarters. Mortgage credit has
a significant contemporaneous effect on house prices, which indirectly affects
residential investment.

25.
Recognizing these developments, the authorities have raised targets for coreTier 1 capital. Weakness of the financial sector, fall in real estate prices, and high
unemployment could continue to reinforce each other. For this reason, current policy efforts
to boost banks’ capital ratios are important and will help counter these tendencies. The
Financial Regulator has set a target ratio of 8 percent for core-Tier 1 capital (of which
7 percent is to be equity capital) taking into account losses arising from the ongoing transfer
of loans to NAMA as well as future expected losses on non-NAMA assets until 2012. The
required capital injections will also ensure that banks’ core-Tier 1 capital would remain
above 4 percent in a stress scenario.
26.
But these efforts may be insufficient to finance the early phases of the recovery.
The recent rights issue by one major bank indicates that some private capital is returning to
banks; but the authorities are committed to fill the remaining gaps to ensure that bank capital
will not be a constraint on lending. However, as they recognize, deleveraging to reduce the
loan-to-deposit ratio and banks’ risk aversion will likely constrain lending and the pace of
economic recovery, at least in 2010–11. Higher than expected losses, uncertainties in global

19
regulatory trends, and renewed financial market tensions—that may restrict access to
funding—create downside risks. In this environment, targets for SME lending, which have
been imposed on two major banks in 2010–11, could have adverse effects on credit quality
and hence require strong prudential safeguards, as the nonperforming loans of this sector
have grown rapidly.
IV. FINANCIAL SECTOR: RESTRUCTURING AND STABILITY
27.
The next steps in the financial sector agenda are usefully thought of in two parts.
Restructuring measures are needed to address the continued fallout from the crisis; and a
stronger framework for financial stability, which incorporates lessons from the crisis, will
limit future instability. Together, these measures should help phase out of the government’s
guarantees of bank liabilities.
A. Restructuring
28.
First, NAMA should schedule an orderly disposal of the property assets
acquired. NAMA is to manage the assets acquired with the aim of achieving the best
possible return for the taxpayer over a 7–10 year timeframe (Box 4). The authorities agreed a
holistic approach to NAMA’s success was needed. Rather than aiming to time the market for
an upturn in property prices, the goal should be to reduce the large overhang of property in
state hands (which could keep investors on the sidelines and prices low), restart market
transactions and, thus, help normalize the property market. The lesson from the experience of
all asset management companies—including those that dealt primarily with commercial real
estate (in Sweden and the Resolution Trust Corporation (RTC) in the United States)—is that
a sound and transparent process for the management of asset sales is needed, but moving
ahead with early sales is important.3 Governance of NAMA is strengthened by its
independent board. However, given the government’s large presence in the property market,
implementing the provisions for the oversight of NAMA’s operations, is vital.

3

In Sweden the objective of early sales coincided fortuitously with a quick economic recovery under favorable
external conditions. In the U.S., after delays proved costly, a more aggressive timetable was adopted.

20

Box 4. The National Asset Management Agency
The National Asset Management Agency (NAMA) was established in late 2009 to take
over distressed property-development and commercial real estate assets from five of the
banks covered by the government’s guarantee on banks’ liabilities. Under the completed
first tranche, NAMA has acquired loans with a book value of €15.3 billion for about
€7.7 billion, representing an average discount of 50 percent. In total, about €81 billion
worth of loans are to be acquired at a deep discount by the end of this year.
The participating institutions receive government-guaranteed securities in return for the
assets purchased by NAMA. Assuming an average discount of 50 percent, NAMA would
ultimately issue about €41 billion of securities in total, up to 5 percent of which would
not have to be honored if the proceeds from the asset sales fall short. The purchase and
management of acquired assets is delegated to a Special Purpose Vehicle with 51 percent
private ownership but under NAMA’s control. For this reason, the NAMA-issued
securities are to be treated as off-balance sheet in the Irish budget. A contingent
liability—of 25 percent of GDP—will be extinguished if NAMA recovers its outlays.
For the banks, the loans sales will reduce the uncertainty about the soundness of their
balance sheets and increase their liquidity reserves. Replacing risky property-related
loans with risk-free NAMA bonds reduces banks’ risk-weighted assets and hence
improves capital adequacy. Capital shortfalls due to the NAMA discounts are being met
by a combination of private and public capital injections.

29.
The increasing economic stress will require targeted support for homeowners.
With increasing arrears and reschedulings, the Financial Regulator has cautioned that
homeowner distress may be the “biggest legacy” of the crisis. The Regulator has required
banks to wait 12 months from when arrears arise to initiate repossession on a primary
residence if the borrower is engaged in restructuring arrangements. Government programs
also assist with interest payments for mortgages originated in recent years and interest
supplement to the neediest. The authorities noted that further support measures raise the risk
of moral hazard, and, hence, of strategic default, and create a perception of unfairness. A
working group on Mortgage Arrears and Personal Debt Review is studying available options.
Mindful of these considerations, staff proposed that, with persisting unemployment,
additional support measures may be needed for a narrowly-targeted group of vulnerable
homeowners to limit the economic and social fallout of the crisis. With their capital bolstered
by the state, banks could absorb the initial costs, perhaps basing themselves on the welfare
system to identify eligible beneficiaries.
30.
This process will be aided by an overdue shift to a more efficient and balanced
personal insolvency regime. The authorities noted that discussions were ongoing regarding
inclusion in the law of an optional out-of-court resolution mechanism, and whether this may

21
apply to small businesses as well as individuals. This would allow a more timely and
flexible, as well as less costly alternative to the current legal framework. Staff pointed out
that a repayment period of three to five years and the removal of overly punitive elements
such as imprisonment for nonpayment of civil debts would bring the regime more in line
with European practices.
31.
The authorities’ intent to proactively reshape the system is appropriate. Some
evolutionary restructuring is occurring: some foreign banks are scaling down their Irish
operations. Currently, however, the authorities are focused on bank-by-bank restructuring of
banks benefiting from government support. While much of this relies on disposal of noncore
assets, in one case, the authorities are also contemplating a “good bank/bad bank” split of the
residual operations after moving some of the riskier assets to NAMA. Staff strongly
supported the authorities’ move to mandating a strategic unit within the National Treasury
Management Agency, which also houses NAMA, to foster a market-oriented approach to
achieve a future viable and competitive banking system.
B. Financial Stability
32.
Considerable progress has been achieved in establishing a more assertive
regulatory and supervisory system. Following evolving international practice, the
authorities have set targets for higher and better quality capital, while also focusing on
improved liquidity management. They are moving to strengthen the governance of banks’
boards, raise the fitness and probity requirements of senior managers and board members,
and create further safeguards against related-party lending. In parallel, the de facto
consolidation of the Central Bank and the Financial Regulator, the bill to formalize this
arrangement (including more accountability of the Regulator), the new risk-based
supervisory approach, and plans to upgrade onsite supervision are all steps in the right
direction. The key challenge is to ensure that these plans are implemented in a timely manner
through adequate resources and enhanced enforcement powers.
33.
More immediate attention is needed to establish a special bank resolution
framework. Recent discussions at the European level emphasize timely bank resolution,
triggered by more prudent thresholds. This, in turn, requires a legal framework allowing for
broader resolution tools such as the establishment of bridge banks and the assumption of
liabilities and the purchase of assets. Some European countries have begun to establish
special resolution regimes, with the U.K. taking the lead. The authorities recognize the merits
of a special bank resolution framework, and the delay in establishing one reflects discussion
on choices with respect to the tools suitable for Ireland. Staff emphasized that early action to
introduce a special bank resolution mechanism is needed to meet contingencies and
strengthen the stability framework. The operational arrangements of the deposit guarantee
scheme are being bolstered, and the authorities recognize the need for additional premiums
from banks when they return to greater normalcy.

22
34.
To complement regulatory safeguards, and to reduce and meet the costs of
future crises, a financial stability charge could be contemplated. Such a charge would
have two elements. A risk-adjusted levy, tied to a credible resolution mechanism, would
provide resources for a resolution fund to be used for future crises. A financial activities tax,
levied on the profits and remuneration (of senior executives) would represent a fair
contribution from the sector to general revenues but also serve the purpose of reducing the
sector’s size and, hence, its systemic risk. Such tax measures remain controversial but are
being contemplated in a number of other countries. The authorities noted that Ireland would
be guided by the evolving international practice and these initiatives may need to be deferred
until more normal conditions apply.
V. THE FISCAL OUTLOOK AND CONSOLIDATION AGENDA
A. The Outlook
35.
To counter the deteriorating fiscal position, the authorities moved early to make
substantial, balanced, and lasting consolidation efforts. As the fiscal situation deteriorated
and a large structural deficit emerged (Box 5), the authorities acted repeatedly to take
additional measures and raise the ambition of their fiscal consolidation goals. This was
achieved in a remarkably socially-cohesive manner and represented a balance of economic
and social considerations. The strong upfront measures are expected to yield a net adjustment
of 5½ percent of GDP over 2009–10. The 2010 budget focused on expenditure measures:
reductions in the wage bill, social welfare benefits, and public services spending, in particular
health care and education. The scope of public service pensions was reduced for new
entrants, starting in 2010. Within the imperative to consolidate, efforts were made to
maintain activity and employment, and safeguard those worst hit by the recession. Revenue
measures included a carbon tax, to provide incentives for low-carbon energy.

Box 5. Asset Booms and Structural Fiscal Balances
Tax revenues were boosted by the property
bubble. For Ireland, revenues from capital
taxes and stamp duties increased from
2 percent in 2000 to 4 percent of GDP
in 2007, while VAT increased one percentage
point of GDP to 7½ percent over that period.
At their peak in 2007, these revenues
represented over a third of total current
revenues. In contrast, they were one fifth of
current revenues in Spain and the U.K., two
other countries with large asset booms.

36.
The 2010 budget adheres to the consolidation track, but risks remain. The
authorities project the 2010 deficit to be 11½ percent of GDP. Because of lower
nominal 2009 GDP than assumed in the 2010 budget and a weaker growth projection, staff
projects lower revenues, leading to a deficit of 11.9 percent of GDP in 2010. The accounting
treatment of the government’s equity injections into the troubled banks is still being
determined but could raise the 2010 headline deficit substantially.4 The authorities noted that
the associated fiscal outlays have already been incorporated into the official debt figures.
4

A re-classification of a capital injection (2½ percent of GDP) as a capital transfer raised the 2009 deficit to
14¼ percent of GDP. In the first half of 2010, the government issued promissory notes worth 8½ percent of
GDP to increase capital in one bank and two building societies. If these injections are considered capital
transfers, the 2010 deficit would increase by this amount. As it would represent a once-off adjustment, it would
not impact on the trajectory of the deficit for 2011. The further possible capital injection of 5 percent of GDP
would add correspondingly to the 2010 deficit.

24
37.
The remaining sovereign financing need in 2010 is
limited. The average maturity of Irish treasury bonds is
high—at 7½ years—and the rollover need is therefore
limited. For 2010, about three quarters of the planned
government bond issuance (€20 billion) had been obtained as
of June. The annual financing needs in 2011–12 are
projected at about the 2010 level. The authorities maintain
sizeable cash balances, financed by short-term debt, which
could act as a buffer against any temporary difficulties in
issuing long-term debt.

The gross f inancing need is expected to remain
below the 2009 level in the medium term

Staff supports the appropriately ambitious fiscal consolidation plan through
2014 but cautioned that the required adjustment may be larger than projected by the
authorities. The consolidation plan, outlined in the December 2009 Stability Programme
Update, aims to reduce the deficit to below 3 percent of GDP by 2014. The plan envisages
fiscal adjustment of 4½ percent of GDP over 2011–14, of which about 1 percent of GDP
represents reductions in capital expenditures. The staff’s macroeconomic projections imply
that the required medium-term adjustment could be larger than projected by the authorities.
Starting from a higher projected deficit in 2010 and based on less optimistic macroeconomic
projections, staff estimates that the adjustment need over 2011–14 would be 6½ percent of
GDP, 2 percentage points of GDP higher than the authorities do. The authorities concurred
with staff on the importance of meeting the targets they have set within the agreed timeframe.

1/ The difference between the fiscal projections of the Department of Finance and the IMF staff is due in part to assumptions of lower
growth on the part of the IMF staff. The IMF staff’s baseline fiscal projections for 2011–12 incorporate the adjustment efforts announced
by the authorities in their December 2009 Stability Programme Update, although 2/3 of these measures remain to be specified.
For the remainder of the period, the IMF staff’s projections do not incorporate the further adjustments efforts outlined in the Stability
Programme Update. However, the Irish authorities have committed to the implementation of these additional adjustment measures,
which is supported by their favorable track record to date in taking the necessary actions to attain budgetary targets.

25 percent of GDP in 2010.
B. The Consolidation Strategy
40.
The authorities agreed that expenditure savings will remain central to achieving
the consolidation targets. The recent expenditure commission identified detailed potential
reductions yielding savings of €5.3 billion (3½ percent of GDP), of which about €2 billion
have been implemented in the 2010 budget. Looking ahead, although capital and multiannual spending reduction plans have indicated the size of the adjustment needed in each
year, they are not backed by sufficient specificity. In response to staff’s view that more detail
would provide further confidence regarding the durability of their consolidation effort, they
noted that initial steps towards establishing a medium-term framework had been taken. Thus,
more generally, they foresee efficiency savings from the ongoing public services
modernization, particularly in the health and education sectors. To underpin these gains, a
draft public service agreement has been ratified by labor unions for the reduction in the
number of public service employees through nonreplacement and flexible redeployment.
Social welfare transfers were reduced in the previous budget, but entitlement reforms could
generate further savings.
41.
The authorities recognize that revenue enhancement should contribute to the
consolidation. Taking into account the recommendations of the tax commission and
consistent with staff advice, the authorities are currently developing proposals to reform
income taxation, with the aim to simplify and broaden the income tax base. The reform
would include eliminating tax exemptions, reviewing the income tax bands, consolidating the
current levies and introducing a universal social charge. The authorities agreed that property
taxation would also help broaden the tax base while at the same time making it more stable
than the current system of stamp duties. In the transition to a valuation-based tax, a flat tax
rate is under consideration.

26
42.
Now is also a good moment to establish an institutional process to reinforce the
collective commitment to stable public finances. The authorities recognize the risk of
“consolidation fatigue” and, hence, a fraying of the social cohesion needed to complete the
consolidation task. In principle, they agreed with staff that institutionalizing the commitment
to fiscal goals could prove valuable, and consideration is being given to bolstering the
institutional arrangements. The authorities regard with greater favor a medium-term
expenditure framework to reduce the uncertainties associated with the consolidation process,
while also constraining excesses in good times ahead. They indicated that they are
considering how to strengthen institutional arrangements in this regard. . While
acknowledging the limitations of fiscal rules and councils, staff maintained that these
institutions would enhance policy credibility now and in the future. A fiscal rule, consistent
with the Stability and Growth Pact, would create a public metric for sound public finances
and a technocratic fiscal council could advise on risks underlying public finances.
VI. STAFF APPRAISAL
43.
Ireland is emerging from a deep slump into a modestly-paced recovery. Helped
by active policy stabilization measures and, increasingly, by the improved global outlook,
GDP is expected to resume growing this year. However, because GDP fell steeply and
through much of last year, the 2010 real GDP is expected to be about ½ percent lower than in
2009. As the crisis-related dislocations are corrected, GDP growth should increase gradually
to about 3½ percent by 2015, while unemployment should decline from a peak of about
13¾ percent this year to still high 9½ percent.
44.
A continuation of vigorous policy efforts is required with an emphasis on risk
management. The challenge is to wean the banking sector from public support and stabilize
public debt in a testing environment of gradual domestic economic recovery and episodic
international market tensions. Mindful, therefore, that unforeseen fiscal shocks and, at times,
heavily bunched banks’ funding needs could constrain policy options along the narrow path
to stability and recovery, active risk management should guide policy priorities. This will
require a continued visible demonstration of commitment to the goals set. But with limited
fiscal space, the commitment will need to be backed increasingly by mechanisms for
accountability and oversight to anticipate and contain slippages and surprises.
45.
To address the fallout from the crisis, three restructuring priorities deserve
attention. Having acquired risky assets, NAMA’s task would include restoring the
commercial property market through an orderly schedule of market transactions.
Economically-vulnerable homeowners will likely need narrowly-targeted support, including
through banks that have been recapitalized by the state. And, following the stabilization
effort through bank-by-bank restructuring, a strategic, market-oriented view should help
reshape the banking sector.

27
46.
Much progress has been made on the financial stability agenda, but a special
bank resolution scheme remains an important gap. The de facto combination of the
Central Bank and the Financial Regulator is being formalized. The new assertive, risk-based
supervisory approach is welcome and needs to be backed by further resources and
enforcement powers. The establishment of special bank resolution regime, which has been
recognized internationally as a key stability tool, requires immediate attention.
47.
In their 2010 budget, the authorities have stayed on course towards their
consolidation goals, but much remains to be done. The authorities’ consolidation target
and path remain appropriate. The plan also strikes the right balance with its central reliance
on expenditure reduction complemented by necessary revenue enhancement through a
broader tax base. However, in a tense market environment for sovereign debt, the authorities
should be prepared with additional measures to meet their targets in case of unexpected fiscal
demands. The commitment to the consolidation path will be reinforced by greater specificity
on the measures foreseen.
48.
This is also a good moment to establish a stronger fiscal framework. A mediumterm fiscal framework incorporating expenditure ceilings is a valuable management tool that
will help create greater transparency of fiscal priorities and reduce fiscal volatility.
Recognizing their limits, a fiscal rule would be a helpful public metric of fiscal prudence and
a technocratic fiscal council would help dampen fiscal risks.
49.
The next Article IV consultation with Ireland is expected to take place on the
standard 12-month cycle.

Sources: Department of Finance; and staff estimates.

1/ The difference between the fiscal projections of the Department of Finance and the IMF staff is due in part to assumptions of lower growth on the part of
the IMF staff. The IMF staff’s baseline fiscal projections for 2011–12 incorporate the adjustment efforts announced by the authorities in their December 2009
Stability Programme Update, although 2/3 of these measures remain to be specified. For the remainder of the period, the IMF staff’s projections do not
incorporate the further adjustments efforts outlined in the Stability Programme Update. However, the Irish authorities have committed to the implementation of
these additional adjustment measures, which is supported by their favorable track record to date in taking the necessary actions to attain budgetary targets.
2/ Net debt is defined as gross debt minus the value of the National Pensions Reserve Fund, the Social Insurance Fund, and cash balances.

Appendix I. Ireland: Public Sector and External Sustainability
Fiscal Sustainability
General government debt has increased from 25 percent of GDP in 2007 to 64 percent in
2009 as a result of the deterioration in the fiscal position. Under the baseline scenario, the
debt ratio is expected to rise to 86 percent of GDP in 2010, reflecting the primary deficit
(9 percent of GDP) and fiscal outlays for bank recapitalization (8½ percent of GDP). In the
medium term, the primary deficit is expected to be reduced through continued fiscal
consolidation efforts and economic growth, stabilizing the debt ratio at about 98 percent of
GDP in 2014–15.
The debt sustainability analysis illustrates the importance of continued fiscal consolidation.
Under a scenario where the primary balance is kept constant at the 2009 level, general
government debt would reach 125 percent of GDP in 2015. The sustainability of the fiscal
position is also sensitive to exogenous macroeconomic shocks, as indicated by the bound
tests (Figure A1).
External Sustainability
From being balanced in 2007, the net external position went into a 60 percent of GDP deficit
in 2008 (Table A2). For FDI, assets and liabilities continued to be largely balanced on a
consolidated basis. The deterioration can mainly be attributed to an increase in monetary
financial institutions’ foreign liabilities, which was not matched by an increase in foreign
assets. A part of this increase is related to the activities of the International Financial Services
Center, which accounted for 75 percent of total foreign assets and 70 percent of total foreign
liabilities in 2008.

1/ Gross general government debt.
2/ Derived as [(r - p(1+g) - g + ae(1+r)]/(1+g+p+gp)) times previous period debt ratio, with r = interest rate; p = growth rate of GDP deflator; g = real GDP growth rate; a = share of foreign-currency
denominated debt; and e = nominal exchange rate depreciation (measured by increase in local currency value of U.S. dollar).
3/ The real interest rate contribution is derived from the denominator in footnote 2/ as r - π (1+g) and the real growth contribution as -g.
4/ The exchange rate contribution is derived from the numerator in footnote 2/ as ae(1+r).
5/ For projections, this line includes exchange rate changes.
6/ Defined as public sector deficit, plus amortization of medium and long-term public sector debt, plus short-term debt at end of previous period.
7/ The key variables include real GDP growth; real interest rate; and primary balance in percent of GDP.
8/ Derived as nominal interest expenditure divided by previous period debt stock.
9/ Assumes that key variables (real GDP growth, real interest rate, and other identified debt-creating flows) remain at the level of the last projection year.

Article IV Consultations:

A staff team comprising Mr. Mody (head), Ms. Barkbu, Mr. Tchaidze (all EUR),
Mr. Montes-Negret (MCM), Ms. Luedersen (LEG), and Mr. Melander (SPR) visited Dublin
on May 20–31, 2010, to conduct the 2010 Article IV consultation discussions.
Messrs. Hockin and O’Sullivan from the Executive Director’s office joined the discussions.
The mission met with the Minister for Finance, the Governor of the Central Bank and the
Head of Financial Regulation, as well as other senior officials from the Department of
Finance, the Central Bank and the Irish Financial Regulatory Authority, the National
Treasury Management Agency (NTMA), and the National Asset Management Agency
(NAMA). Other interlocutors included representatives of the Department for Enterprise,
Trade and Innovation, Ireland's National Training and Employment Authority (FÁS), the
Competition Authority, the Central Statistics Office Ireland, the Mortgage Arrears and
Personal Debt Review Group, the Attorney General’s Office, Enterprise Ireland, the

3
Economic and Social Research Institute (ESRI), the Irish Banking Federation, major Irish
banks, stockbrokers, law firms, the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, the Irish Business and
Employers’ Confederation, and several academics.
The last Article IV consultation was concluded on June 15, 2009 (IMF Country Report
No. 09/195). Article IV consultations with Ireland are on the standard 12-month cycle.
VIII.

Exchange Rate Arrangement and Exchange Restrictions

Ireland’s currency is the euro, which floats freely and independently against other currencies.
Ireland has accepted the obligations of Article VIII, Sections 2, 3, and 4, and maintains an
exchange system free of restrictions on payments and transfers for current international
transactions, other than restrictions notified to the Fund under Decision No. 144 (52/51).

II. STATISTICAL ISSUES
A. Assessment of Data Adequacy for Surveillance
General: Data provision is broadly adequate for surveillance.
National accounts and real sector data. Quarterly national accounts are currently published
within three months of its reference period. Other real sector data are relatively timely, with
industrial production and retail sales data published within six weeks and employment data
within 3 months of the reference period, but some non-SDDS series are published one and a
half years later (e.g., household disposable income). Employment and unit labor costs, and
national income and expenditure data are usually available with a three-month lag.
Wages and earnings statistics. The quarterly Earnings, Hours and Employment Costs
Survey has replaced the four-yearly Labor Cost Survey, and also replaces all other existing
short-term earnings surveys. The results are comparable across sectors and include more
detail on components of earnings and labor costs than was available before. However, data
are only available with more than six months lag.
Government finance statistics. The authorities publish Exchequer returns on a monthly and
quarterly basis, but only annual data are available for the general government balance.
Timely data on local government consolidated operations are not available.
External data. Quarterly balance of payments data are compiled by the Central Statistics
Office and are based on statistical surveys combined with administrative data. These data are
closely integrated with the compilation of national accounts and are in line with the Balance
of Payments Manual, Fifth edition (BPM5), although the historical data covers only years
starting from 1998. Furthermore, some discrepancies remain between exports and imports
data from the national accounts and the balance of payments. Data on the international
investment position are published with a six months lag.
B. Data Standards and Quality
Ireland is subject to the statistical
No data ROSC is available.
requirements and timeliness and reporting
standards of Eurostat and the European
Central Bank (ECB). Ireland subscribes to
the Fund’s Special Data Dissemination
Standard and uses SDDS flexibility option on
the timeliness of the wages and earnings and
central government debt data.

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2010 Article IV Consultation with Ireland
On July 7, 2010, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded the
Article IV consultation with Ireland.1
Background
The Irish economy is undergoing a profound adjustment to unwind the imbalances created
during the boom years. Over the past decade, rapid credit growth fueled the property bubble,
while increasing banks’ exposure to the property market. Economic activity became heavily
dependent on the construction and financial sectors. High price and wage growth created a
competitiveness gap. When, around the onset of the global financial crisis, the domestic
property bubble deflated, the balance sheets of households, banks, and the government were
severely damaged. Average national house prices, having fallen by 34 percent from the peak,
are yet to stabilize.
Over 2008–09, output contracted by about 10 percent. Domestic consumption and investment
fell sharply while exports declined less during the global downturn than did exports elsewhere.
Unemployment increased from 4½ percent in 2007 to about 13 percent in March 2010. Recent
indicators point to a return to economic growth during this year, but following its earlier steep
fall, GDP in 2010 is projected to be about ½ percent lower than in 2009. With output below
potential and high unemployment, prices declined by 1.7 percent in 2009 and staff projects a
further fall of 1.8 percent in this year.

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with members,
usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial information, and discusses
with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On return to headquarters, the staff prepares
a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the
Managing Director, as Chairman of the Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this
summary is transmitted to the country's authorities. An explanation of any qualifiers used in summings up can
be found here: http://www.imf.org/external/np/sec/misc/qualifiers.htm.

Under heavy pressure as the domestic crisis weakened asset quality and profitability and
access to international wholesale funding tightened, the banking sector required extensive
support from the government and European Central Bank (ECB) liquidity provision. Banks’
borrowing is supported by government guarantees, the National Asset Management Agency
(NAMA) has started acquiring distressed property development and commercial real estate
assets from banks at a sizeable discount, and, following stress-testing by the Financial
Regulator, the government is contributing to banks’ capital enhancement.
Public finances were in balance over 2003–07, but were reliant on rapid growth and propertyrelated revenues. As economic activity fell and bank recapitalization costs materialized, the
general government deficit increased to 14¼ percent of GDP in 2009. Gross public debt
increased from 25 percent of GDP in 2006 to 64 percent of GDP in 2009. The government has
implemented a series of consolidation measures to help contain the deficit below 12 percent in
2010. The authorities’ multi-year plan is intended to achieve a sustainable fiscal position.
Despite the policy credibility achieved through these efforts, renewed market pressures in
recent weeks point to the challenges ahead.
Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors considered that the authorities’ decisive measures to support the banking
sector and advance fiscal consolidation have helped gain policy credibility and stabilize the
economy. Directors encouraged the authorities to sustain these efforts and actively manage
risks going forward.
Directors noted that vulnerabilities remain elevated as evidenced by continued pressures in
sovereign debt and bank funding markets. With limited fiscal resources for dealing with
contingencies, maintaining a steady policy course will require effective mechanisms for
oversight and transparency, and high-quality communication to minimize risks and sustain
market confidence.
Directors concurred with staff’s analysis that the speed of the recovery is likely to be moderate
with relatively limited growth and high unemployment. Growth prospects are weighed down by
the ongoing correction of pre-crisis imbalances. The unwinding of these imbalances—arising
from rapid credit growth, inflated property prices, and high wage and price levels—could limit
the upside potential. In this context, Directors noted that structural reforms aimed at regaining
competitiveness and boosting potential output are necessary to put the recovery on a
sustainable track.
Recognizing that much progress had been made to strengthen the banking sector, Directors
observed that a sizeable agenda remains. They welcomed the transfer of banks’ distressed
property development and commercial real estate assets to the NAMA and the complementary
decision to raise banks’ capital targets. Going forward, the orderly disposal of NAMA’s assets
will help restore the commercial property market. While mindful of the moral hazard risks,

Directors noted that narrowly-targeted support measures for vulnerable homeowners would limit
the economic and social fallout of the crisis. Directors also welcomed the authorities’ intent to
proactively reshape the banking system, noting the importance of using a strategic, but marketoriented, approach.
Directors emphasized the need to strengthen the financial stability framework. They welcomed
recent institutional changes to enhance regulation and the proposed new risk-based supervisory
approach. They also encouraged an early action to introduce a special bank resolution
mechanism, which would further strengthen the stability framework and add to the set of tools
available to meet contingencies.
Acknowledging the authorities’ significant fiscal efforts to date, Directors underscored the
importance of adhering to the further consolidation targets going forward. They noted that the
authorities’ ambitious targets remained appropriate, but their achievement would require
continued resolve. Directors agreed that the consolidation plan would benefit from greater
specificity. Many Directors also encouraged the authorities to stand ready to adopt additional
measures to reach the fiscal goals and retain hard-earned credibility in the event of unfavorable
developments.
Directors encouraged the authorities to move further towards a medium-term budget framework.
This could help provide the structure to reduce the uncertainties associated with the
consolidation process. Directors also recommended that the authorities consider adopting a
fiscal rule and establish a fiscal council to advise on risks underlying public finances. Such
mechanisms could help enhance policy credibility now and in the future.
