Mission. A staff team visited Hong Kong SAR, October 20−30, 2008 consisting of N. Chalk
(Head), N. Porter, F. Vitek (APD) and O. Unteroberdoerster (Resident Representative).
V. Arora (Senior Resident Representative, Beijing) participated in the policy discussions and
Messrs. He and Yung (OED) joined the mission.
Economy. Growth has slowed in the first half of this year, as external conditions have
worsened. Inflation remains elevated, driven by food prices and housing costs. The fallout
from the global credit turmoil has spilled into local markets, with equity prices falling
markedly and signs of stress in interbank markets. The authorities have responded with a range
of measures to provide liquidity, stimulate domestic demand, and bolster confidence.
Focus. The mission’s central focus was on how the real economy and financial sector are
holding up in the face of spillovers from the ongoing upheaval in international financial
markets and the appropriate policy response to such extraordinary global events. The mission
also examined three salient structural challenges currently facing Hong Kong SAR: the
introduction of a minimum wage, the rising costs of healthcare, and ongoing economic
changes in the Pearl River Delta.
Past advice. The Fund has generally supported the authorities’ policies and reforms.
Exchange arrangement. Currency board with a trading band of HK$7.75−7.85 per
U.S. dollar. Obligations under Article VIII have been accepted for Hong Kong SAR and the
exchange system is free of restrictions for current transactions.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
The 2008 Article IV consultation discussions took place against the backdrop of
extraordinary volatility in international financial markets. The impact of these external
conditions on Hong Kong’s financial markets and the real economy, as well as the
appropriate policy response, was the central focus of discussions.
The primary risk to Hong Kong SAR is through a self-fulfilling, financial contagion that
damages confidence and propagates itself through the domestic financial system. The
authorities have recognized this risk and acted decisively to contain the fallout from ongoing
global turmoil. They have ensured there is ample liquidity in the financial system, bolstered
confidence through deposit guarantees and the establishment of a contingent bank capital
facility, and enhanced supervision of financial institutions.
Despite these efforts, as an open economy that is fully integrated into the global financial
system, Hong Kong SAR is set for a significant economic slowdown. The weaker global
economy, international financial volatility, the slowdown in the Pearl River Delta, a scarcity
of credit, and weakening consumer confidence are all going to present significant headwinds.
Growth is expected to fall to 2 percent next year and unemployment will steadily rise.
To support the economy, the authorities have put in place a sizable fiscal stimulus package
that will boost demand and protect those most exposed to an economic slowdown. A similar
sized package will likely be required in the coming fiscal year. Over a more medium-term
horizon, it will be critical for the government to reform the healthcare system to maintain the
quality of care, particularly for the elderly and vulnerable groups. In order to avoid a sizable
increase in the tax burden, the government will need to ensure that the private sector bears a
larger share of healthcare spending.
Hong Kong SAR’s Linked Exchange Rate System continues to be an anchor of monetary and
financial stability. The level of the real exchange rate appears to be valued broadly in line
with economic fundamentals.
The prospective introduction of a minimum wage will need to be managed carefully to
ensure the living standards of the working poor are preserved without materially affecting
their employment prospects. Over a longer horizon, growth prospects will depend critically
on managing both financial and real sector integration with Mainland China.

4
I. MACROECONOMIC BACKDROP
1.
Context. Hong Kong SAR’s economy has undergone a remarkable metamorphosis
over the past decades. These changes have resulted in almost all manufacturing operations
moving to the Pearl River Delta. At the same time, the economy has leveraged its strong
institutional framework, flexible labor and product markets, and status as a global financial
center to transform itself into a dynamic, knowledge-based, service economy (Figure 1).
Hong Kong SAR has emerged from this process of deep-rooted change with an enviable
growth performance that has averaged 7 percent over the past four years. Unemployment
reached its lowest point in more than a decade, rising disposable incomes have propelled
forward private consumption, and productivity growth has been high.
2.
Growth. However, as one of the most open economies in the world and with its focus
on financial and trade services, Hong Kong SAR is highly exposed to the unfolding crisis in
international financial markets and to the slowdown in the global economy. There are now
clear signs of economic deceleration largely attributable to falling private consumption
growth and declines in financial services (Figure 2).
3.
External position. Net exports of goods and services fell in the first half of 2008, as
the terms of trade worsened and demand from the E.U., Japan and the U.S. weakened.
However, the current account surplus has declined only modestly, in part due to higher
investment income. Official reserves were slightly lower in the second quarter—due to losses
on Exchange Fund investments—but have since remained stable. Portfolio flows have rotated
out of equities and into local currency and deposit holdings.
4.
Inflation. Consumer price
inflation has increased over the past two
years, driven by imported food inflation
and an upward trend in the cost of
housing. Headline figures have fallen
rapidly in recent months, to 3 percent at
end-September. However, after adjusting
for the effect of recent budgetary
measures, underlying inflation appears to
have only just peaked.

factors, yields a fiscal impulse of around

6.
Growth outlook. The economy is expected to slow markedly through the remainder
of this year, to around 2 percent in 2009 with significant downside risks to that forecast. The
slowdown is, in large part, a result of lower private consumption growth—as consumer
confidence falls amid global economic uncertainty and declines in local asset prices—and
weaker external demand. The government’s 2008/09 budget and the more recent fiscal
stimulus package should help mitigate the anticipated softening of consumption growth in the
short term and the planned ramp-up in public infrastructure spending will provide support to
growth over a somewhat longer horizon. Beyond that, growth prospects will depend critically
on the trajectory of economic and financial integration with the mainland and on how those
interdependencies are managed. However, a long-run growth rate of around 5 percent seems

8
feasible given the consistent improvements in productivity and overall dynamism and
adaptability of the economy.
7.
Inflation outlook. Staff models indicate that inflation should fall below 3 percent
over the next 1−2 years as food inflation, and to a lesser extent energy prices, work through
the system and housing costs moderate. However, the outlook is complicated by the
expiration of temporary fiscal measures—such as waivers of rents and rates, and transfers to
cover the cost of electricity—which, as they are unwound, may add to inflation. On the other
hand, the slowing economy should dampen price pressures.
8.
Risks and spillovers. Given Hong Kong’s openness and status as an international
financial center, the main growth risks relate to a further worsening of market turbulence.
This could evolve through two broad channels. First, global volatility may directly spill into
local financial markets causing further declines in equity markets, strains in hedge funds and
other asset management companies, and potential dislocation in money markets. Heightened
risk aversion would accompany such volatility leading to a sudden stop in the provision of
bank credit. Second, international financial developments may precipitate a sharper growth
decline in the global economy. This would accelerate the already-evident growth downturn in
the Pearl River Delta region of Mainland China and spillover into Hong Kong SAR due to
the extensive trade, logistics, and related services that are provided to Mainland producers.
Over a longer horizon, a global downsizing of financial intermediation may be reflected in a
smaller financial system in Hong Kong SAR. There are already signs that the size of the local
asset management and hedge fund industry will shrink in the coming years. However, the
bulk of financial system assets are banking related and should withstand a global downturn
fairly well. More importantly, though, there are significant opportunities for expansion of
financial service provision to Mainland China making the risk of a major retrenchment in
Hong Kong’s financial service business over the longer term seem relatively modest.
II. THE IMPACT OF THE GLOBAL FINANCIAL TURMOIL
A. The Effect of Recent Volatility
9.
Initial phase. Starting from the second half of 2007, Hong Kong SAR’s financial
system coped well with the sharp increase in volatility in international financial markets. This
resilience was, in large part, a result of robust supervision and regulation as well as local
financial institutions’ own internal risk management. There was relatively little exposure to
the securitized products at the epicenter of the global volatility and ample room for the
financial system to absorb those losses that were revealed. Nevertheless, lingering concerns
over counterparty risk did raise interbank rates for lending at longer (3−6 month) maturities.
In addition, equity markets were a visible casualty of the volatility, losing one-third of their
value from the market peak in October 2007 to end-August 2008. The unfavorable market
conditions stymied planned IPOs, resulting in a loss of fee income for the banks (Figure 3).

9

Figure 3. Financial Market Developments
Main Message: The financial system has been battered by global financial shocks. Equity prices have fallen
and money markets have been under pressure. Renewed strains have become evident since late September.
Initially, global financial volatility was primarily manifested through a
sell off in local equity markets…

Second phase. Since late September, the dramatic increase in the intensity of the
global crisis has resulted in a discernibly more potent pass through to local markets.
•

On September 24, unfounded rumors of liquidity problems and losses from
international exposures catalyzed a fleeting retail deposit run at a major retail bank.
This highlighted the fragility of investor confidence despite the sound fundamentals
of the financial system.

•

Shortly afterwards, as
pressures built in international
markets, Hong Kong
interbank rates spiked
upwards due to rising
concerns over counterparty
risk, higher risk aversion, and
some degree of liquidity
hoarding. The market for term
interbank lending dried up
with significant tiering among
counterparties.

•

Equity markets recorded extraordinary volatility, falling a further 35 percent during
September-October with sometimes double-digit daily percentage moves in the Hang
Seng index. Short selling activity remained subdued throughout this period at around
7 percent of total market turnover.

•

Rising risk aversion and liquidity preference precipitated a flight to quality. High
quality collateral, such as the government’s Exchange Fund Paper, became
particularly valuable—not least because such instruments were potentially usable to
access Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) lending facilities—and nominal
interest rates on short-dated instruments turned negative for several days.

•

The spot exchange rate appreciated towards the strong side of the convertibility
undertaking, hitting the band in late October and early November. Local currency
term interest rates remained relatively high despite the capital inflows.

•

Retail investors, who had suffered significant losses on complex financial products
linked to Lehman Brothers (so-called “Minibonds”), staged street demonstrations
against alleged mis-selling of such instruments by local financial institutions.

11
B. The Policy Response
11.
An array of tools. The government tackled the serious financial situation on multiple
fronts, mobilizing a broad range of instruments, some already existing within its toolkit,
others that were custom-designed for the contagion at hand:
•

FX intervention. In September and October, the HKMA reacted to upward spikes in
local interest rates by intervening within the exchange rate band, injecting
HK$25 billion in liquidity through spot purchases of U.S. dollars. After nominal
interest rates on Exchange Fund Paper turned negative for several days in October,
the HKMA also announced an extraordinary issue of HK$4 billion in Exchange Fund
bills. In addition, over the past two weeks, the HKMA undertook a combined
HK$15½ billion spot purchase of U.S. dollars as the currency hit the strong side of
the band.

•

Discount window. The HKMA announced an enhancement of its discount window
operations in late September to normalize conditions in interbank markets. Accepted
collateral was expanded to include U.S. Treasury securities, maturities were extended
to up to three months, and the rate for discount window borrowing was reduced (to
50 basis points above U.S. federal funds rates) and de-linked from interbank rates.

•

New facilities. The HKMA also offered two new discretionary facilities, available
upon request from licensed banks: foreign exchange swaps and a term lending facility
that would provide Hong Kong dollar liquidity against approved collateral for up to
three months. Like the enhancement of the discount windows, these facilities will
remain in place until March 2009.

•

Deposit guarantee and contingent bank capital facility. On October 14, the
government announced a blanket guarantee of all customer deposits held with all
authorized institutions in Hong Kong, including those of foreign bank branches, as
well as a new contingent facility to provide capital to locally incorporated banks,
upon request from the banks and subject to supervisory scrutiny. The form and terms
of such capital injections will be decided on the basis of individual circumstances.
Both will remain in place until end-2010, backed by the substantial resources of the
Exchange Fund.

•

Supervision. The HKMA and Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) stepped up
their supervisory role, including greater monitoring of banks’ liquidity risk
management frameworks and contingency funding plans, an expanded scope for
stress testing, and active supervision of local brokers, including through more on-site
visits. The authorities have also initiated investigations into alleged misrepresentation
of the risks associated with Minibonds. In the meantime, the banks that had marketed
these products to retail investors have agreed to buy them back at market prices.

•

Mortgage purchase. If there is renewed interest from local banks, the Hong Kong
Mortgage Corporation stands ready to provide liquidity to the financial system

12
through purchase of residential mortgages from bank balance sheets. To facilitate
this, a fast-track procedure for such purchases has been instituted.
•

Insurance. Hong Kong’s insurance regulator ring-fenced the assets of the local
subsidiary of AIG to protect local policyholders. The government also increased
inspections of insurers and plans to establish a protection scheme for insurance policy
holders in order to increase confidence. In addition, there are plans to convert the
current insurance regulator into an independent and autonomous body, with a more
flexible staffing structure.

•

Task force. The Chief Executive has formed a high-level task force, which he chairs,
to follow developments in global markets, assess their impact on local and global
markets as well as the local economy, and suggest policy options. Fund staff
participated in the inaugural meeting of this group in early November.

12.
Assessment. The authorities and staff shared a common diagnosis of the underlying
source of financial strains and fully agreed on the range of actions taken to counter global
spillovers. The authorities rightly recognized that, while fundamentals in the Hong Kong
financial system are strong, the current global climate presents a serious risk of self-fulfilling
contagion to local markets. Hong Kong SAR has long had in place a comprehensive system
for crisis management and has done extensive contingency planning to prepare for a range of
possible scenarios. This allowed the authorities to move rapidly and preemptively to contain
such contagion risks. The authorities have complemented their decisive actions with an
effective communication strategy to reassure investors and clearly explain the rationale
behind each new policy step.
C. The Outlook for the Financial System
13.
Banks. Despite the market volatility, Hong Kong banks remain profitable, liquid, and
well capitalized. Loan-to-deposit ratios

wholesale sources of funding. While some
banks have incurred losses in
U.S. subprime securities and structured assets, total exposure to such assets—as well as to
special investment vehicles and monoline insurers—remains low (well below ½ percent of
banking system assets). Looking forward, there was broad consensus that

13
banks will face pressure on profits from declining margins between funding costs—which are
invariably linked to interbank rates—and loan rates as well as the loss of fee income from a
decline in both IPOs and wealth management business. Credit quality will likely decline in
the coming months, a result of the slowing domestic economy. However, at present, these
pressures look manageable for the banking system as a whole. The HKMA has undertaken
extensive stress testing and, even under a severely stressed scenario (whereby credit loss
rates rise sharply, the value of property and equity holdings fall by around one-half, interest
margins narrow substantially, and the decline in output is greater than that seen during the
Asian financial crisis), no bank will see its capital fall below 8 percent of risk-weighted
assets.
14.
Credit. While credit expanded rapidly in 2007 as a result of equity-related lending,
much of that has now been unwound. In discussions with the private sector, it seemed that a
marked credit crunch is now evolving in Hong Kong SAR although, so far, this view appears
largely based on anecdotal information with official data not yet available. Increased risk
aversion, rising liquidity preference, and concerns over the real economy are leading
financial institutions to consolidate their balance sheets and cut back on new credit to
consumers, corporates, and even other financial institutions. This is affecting both local
entities and Hong Kong companies operating in Mainland China. It is difficult to predict how
long this phenomenon will continue but there was a general sense that it would be well into
next year before some normalization of lending behavior gets underway.
15.
Equity markets. The equity markets and the related trading and settlement systems
have worked effectively despite sometimes extraordinary volatility. There is already a
prohibition on naked short selling and an uptick rule in place. The authorities believed there
was no reason to modify the current system or introduce additional restrictions on
short-selling but were continuing to carefully track short selling activity to identify
potentially destabilizing activity. Staff agreed with this measured approach.
16.
Asset management. Hedge funds and wealth managers make up a sizable part of the
Hong Kong financial system with assets under management at end-2007 of around
US$835 billion. Private banking, corporate fund advisory, and REITs add a further
US$400 billion to this total. Discussions with private participants indicate that hedge funds
managed in Hong Kong are, on the whole, not highly leveraged and have built significant
cash positions to meet redemptions. Nonetheless, the funds as a group have performed poorly
over the past year and withdrawals should be expected going forward, which may put some
pressure on the local financial system. However, the lack of comprehensive data on these
funds makes it difficult to predict the channels by which such spillovers may emerge.
17.
Property. Hong Kong real estate prices have risen 30 percent over the past three
years. The staff’s assessment, which is shared by the authorities, is that the bulk of this
increase can be explained by the fundamentals of a strong local economy, low real mortgage
rates, and rising rental costs. This implies that, as those fundamentals weaken, average
property values will move downward. Recent declines in the Hang Seng property index and a

Asian financial crisis peak, when a sizable
share of homeowners had negative equity,
default rates on residential mortgages were less than 3 percent. Since then, loan-to-value
ratios for property lending have been managed conservatively. In addition, property
developers, which account for around one-half of all property lending, have manageable
financing needs over the next few years and substantial rental income to provide them with a
stable source of liquidity.
III. THE ROLE OF MACROECONOMIC POLICIES
18.
The need for a macroeconomic policy response. The financial policies taken to stem
the crisis have been effective but can only prevent dislocation and disorderly adjustment in
local financial markets, not resist movements in asset prices as they adjust to their new
equilibrium. At this point, the shockwaves to growth from financial and trade channels are
largely unavoidable and will have significant, albeit uncertain, fallout for the Hong Kong
economy well into 2009. There was agreement that, in addition to expanding its financial
policy tools, the government would need to make full use of the macroeconomic policies at
its disposal as a countervailing force to the deteriorating external environment.
19.
The scale of fiscal stimulus. There is certainly room in the near term for
discretionary fiscal stimulus to guard against the emerging growth slowdown. While
monetary conditions—imported from the United States—are currently supportive, staff and
the authorities recognized that broader financial conditions were much tighter. The large
fiscal stimulus intended for the current fiscal year, if realized, will provide a welcome
impetus. There was a shared view that the risks to growth should predominate in the setting
of fiscal policy and that there were negligible downside risks to erring on the side of too
much fiscal stimulus, given the strong financial position of the public sector (net reserves of
the government are almost 30 percent of GDP). Staff argued that the fiscal position for the
2009/10 fiscal year should remain expansionary with the government targeting either fiscal
balance or a modest deficit in the upcoming budget. This would yield a moderate fiscal
impulse of around 1 percent of GDP. The authorities noted it was still early in the budget

15
preparation cycle but that it would be a difficult budget year. However, at this stage, it
seemed that a stimulus of the order suggested by staff was probably appropriate.
20.
Structure of the stimulus. The 2008/09 fiscal package and the July 2008 supplement
contain many measures that merit support. The increase in government investment in
transport infrastructure will be essential to better integrate Hong Kong SAR with the
mainland, opening up opportunities for both economies. The extension of free education to
senior secondary school levels and establishment of a university-level research endowment
will further innovation and raise educational standards, meeting the increasing demand for
skills. In addition, increased social assistance to low income households and the elderly
appears to be well targeted and will help protect vulnerable groups. Staff, however, believed
that the temporary waiver of income taxes, property taxes, and rates, as well as the transfers
to individual electricity accounts and the rent reductions for the 50 percent of the population
that live in public housing were likely to benefit mostly middle-income groups and may do
little to spur domestic demand. The mission advocated, instead, taking a more medium-term
perspective in the 2009/10 budget, favoring fiscal stimulus through an acceleration of
infrastructure spending and a reduction in direct tax rates rather than an extension of the
temporary measures that were introduced over the past two fiscal years.
21.
Fiscal anchor. The budget’s very conservative forecasts—understandable given the
volatility of fiscal revenues—have under-predicted the fiscal surplus by a large margin over
the past several years. This year, it appears

volatility, the government should begin publishing official intra-year forecasts of the fiscal
outturn. This would be important, particularly at the current juncture, to guide expectations
on the degree of stimulus that is likely in the coming year and, ultimately, to increase the
effectiveness of fiscal policy.

16
IV. RECENT COMPETITIVENESS TRENDS
22.
Developments. Over the past year, the Hong Kong dollar has depreciated around
2−3 percent in both real and nominal effective terms, alongside the depreciation in the
U.S. dollar. During this same period, the terms of trade have deteriorated modestly, reflecting
rising costs of imported food and fuel. Other factors that influence the underlying equilibrium
exchange rate—including productivity and economic structure—have moved relatively little.
23.
Exchange rate assessment. On balance, the Hong Kong dollar continues to be valued
broadly in line with fundamentals (Box 1). The current account surplus is consistent with
Hong Kong’s demographic structure and status as a financial center and the net external asset
position, while large (at 252 percent of GDP), has been relatively stable. In addition,
intervention in foreign currency markets has been relatively modest (US$7 billion over the
past three years) and reserve growth has been largely a product of the accrued returns on
assets and the accumulated fiscal surpluses. The authorities concurred with this assessment. It
was also clear, in discussions with both the government and the private sector, that the
Linked Exchange Rate System continues to work well, acting as an important anchor of
monetary and financial stability.
V. ADJUSTING TO LONGER TERM STRUCTURAL CHANGES
A. Maintaining the Flexibility to Adapt to Shocks
24.
Motivation. Hong Kong SAR is currently approaching decision points on two
important reforms that will shape the economy’s ability to adapt to shocks well into the
medium term. First, as a result of prospective demographic trends and rising costs, changes
to the current system of healthcare provision and financing are now needed. Second,
increasing inequality has prompted a decision to adopt a minimum wage.
What are the Implications of Healthcare Financing Reform?
25.
Background. At present, the public sector covers, from general revenues, nearly
56 percent of total health costs (around 2.9 percent of GDP) and more than 90 percent of the
costs of in-patient care. There is insufficient attention paid to preventative care and little
price-based rationing through co-payments, particularly for hospital care. Without action,
public spending on healthcare is projected to almost double to 5½ percent of GDP by 2033
and to 9 percent of GDP by 2050. Continuing with the current health system will lead not
only to a worsening quality of services, which will be mostly incident on the elderly and
lower income groups, but also an unsustainable burden on the fiscal accounts.
26.
Reform options. In March of this year, the government released a consultation paper
that laid out the various alternatives to improve cost effectiveness, facilitate increased private
provision, and introduce supplementary healthcare financing (Box 2).

17

Under the macroeconomic balance approach, estimates suggest that the medium-term current
account equilibrium is a surplus of the order of 8½ percent of GDP, reflecting a low dependency ratio
and high net foreign asset position. This suggests that the Hong Kong dollar is around 3 percent
overvalued in real effective terms. However, once one accounts for the uncertainty surrounding the
size of trade elasticities, this point estimate has fairly low precision.
The equilibrium real exchange rate approach, on
the other hand, indicates the Hong Kong dollar is
currently undervalued by around 13 percent
although the uncertainty surrounding this point
estimate is large.

about 7½ percent of GDP. This is somewhat
larger than the projected trade surplus (of 5 percent of GDP) and implies an overvaluation of the
currency of around 7 percent.

18

Box 2. Hong Kong SAR: Government Proposals for Healthcare Reform
The government has proposed a menu of reform options, drawing on international
experience and outlining the relative advantages and disadvantages of each.
Provision of primary care. Increase the emphasis on preventative care by leveraging the
system of family doctors and offering subsidies via primary care vouchers; improve targeting
of particular age, gender, and disease groups.
Private participation. Purchase primary care and some hospital services (e.g., cataract
surgeries) from the private sector; engage private doctors in public hospitals; consider
developing new hospitals under private-public partnerships.
Supplementary financing. Options include:
•

Social health insurance. Mandatory contributions (of around 3−5 percent of earned
income) to fund either publicly or privately-provided health insurance.

•

Higher out-of-pocket payments. Reducing the level of public subsidy from 95 percent to
60 percent of costs by 2030 with fee waivers for low-income groups or those with
chronic conditions.

•

Medical savings accounts. Mandatory savings accounts (of a fixed share of earned
income) that can be used for payment of future health costs or private health insurance
premiums.

•

Voluntary private health insurance. Through an expansion of the current
employer-provided and/or individually purchased private insurance.

•

Mandatory private health insurance. To increase risk pooling, the scope of required
coverage would be specified by law; contributions would be de-linked from income level.

•

Personal healthcare reserve (PHR). Mandatory contributions (of a fixed share of income)
would be made into a PHR deposit that would fund (i) compulsory health insurance with
a flat premium for all citizens and (ii) out-of-pocket healthcare payments; PHR
contributions would potentially be tax deductible; there would be a public safety net for
those who have exhausted the funds in their PHR.

19
27.
Assessment. From a macroeconomic perspective, staff expressed concern that any
voluntary financing scheme would lead to excessive consumption volatility and undersaving,
particularly by lower income group in the early part of their working lives.1 This ultimately
could put renewed pressure on the fiscal accounts. Given that only around one-third of the
labor force are in the income tax net, even full tax deductibility of healthcare-related savings
would be an insufficient incentive to prevent such under-provisioning for future health costs.
Therefore, staff believed it is likely that some form of mandatory scheme will be needed. In
addition, the government would also need to continue to finance health coverage for those at
the lower end of the income distribution as well as individuals with extraordinary healthcare
needs. The authorities emphasized that they see the reform of healthcare financing as geared
towards providing a supplement to the existing publicly financed scheme and that any
changes would aim to preserve the freedom of choice of the current system. However, they
noted that the consultation was at an early stage and, as it evolves, the proposals would
become more concrete.
How Will a Minimum Wage Affect Hong Kong SAR’s Flexible Labor Market?
28.
Background. Two years ago, amid growing concerns over a worsening income
distribution, Hong Kong SAR introduced the Wage Protection Movement with a voluntary
minimum wage for security guards and cleaners. It has become clear that the voluntary
nature of the scheme made it rather ineffective. Therefore, the Legislative Council will soon
consider a proposal to introduce an across-the-board minimum wage.
29.
Design of the minimum wage. The mission underlined the importance of ensuring
that any legislation to introduce a new minimum wage be designed in a way that maintains
the ability of Hong Kong’s labor markets to adjust to shocks.
•

Level of the minimum wage. The higher the level of minimum wage, the larger the
impact on macroeconomic and employment volatility as quantities are forced to
adjust to changing conditions, rather than wages and prices. Staff simulations2 suggest
that raising the coverage of the minimum wage would noticeably amplify swings in
employment and output.

•

Adjustment mechanism. Staff noted that any discretionary adjustment scheme—such
as that decided by a minimum wage council—would find it difficult to reduce the
minimum wage in the face of an economic downturn, as may be necessary. Staff
simulations indicate that maintaining a fixed nominal minimum wage or indexing it to

Options for Hong Kong SAR,” IMF Working Paper (forthcoming).

Hong Kong SAR,” IMF Working Paper (forthcoming).

20
the consumer price index would put a greater burden of adjustment on employment
flows. Automatically adjusting the minimum wage alongside changes in average
wages or unit labor costs would generate relatively less volatility.
•

Coverage. The mission fully supported the government’s decision to extend the
minimum wage to the whole economy, rather than confining it to specific professions.
The latter approach would result in distortions to the low-income labor market and
create incentives for evasion of the minimum wage requirement.

•

Supplemental schemes. The mission argued for initially setting the minimum wage
conservatively and assessing its macroeconomic and social implications. If needed,
consideration could be given to supplementing a lower minimum wage with
additional support for the working poor through the social assistance system. The
relatively narrow coverage of the income tax system would probably argue against
any form of tax-related support (such as an earned income tax credit).

The authorities noted that there had, as yet, been no decision on either the design or level of
the minimum wage. The next few months would be spent intensively improving the quality
of the data on the economic conditions of the working poor. The government will establish a
Minimum Wage Commission—drawing members from unions, business, academia, and the
government—which will consider this data and make recommendations on the level of the
minimum wage and review mechanisms during the course of the 2008/09 legislative session.
B. Reacting to Economic Change in the Pearl River Delta
30.
Background. At the center of the major structural changes over the past decade has
been a growing integration with the Pearl River Delta region of Mainland China (PRD).
Manufacturing capacity has been mostly shifted into the PRD and Hong Kong SAR has,
instead, leveraged its comparative advantages to provide services such as logistics,
merchandizing, and finance to PRD enterprises (around 40 percent of all FDI outflows to the
Mainland went to the PRD during 2001−06). Guangdong province has also become a major
source of imports for Hong Kong SAR.
31.
Recent trends. There was a uniform sense from both private and public sector
counterparts that changes in the PRD are moving quickly. Low value-added, labor-intensive
producers are being crowded out by rising labor costs, stricter enforcement of labor rights,
and more rigorous environmental standards. The broader global economic slowdown is now
accelerating this adjustment process. The direct spillovers from these rapid changes in PRD

21
put additional pressure on Hong Kong SAR to adapt and ensure that the economic benefits of
integration are maximized while associated risks are avoided. Staff saw the main issues as:3
•

Infrastructure. Much of the economic development in PRD has been concentrated in
the eastern region closest to Hong Kong SAR. Expanding communications networks
offers significant potential for further growth for both Hong Kong and the Mainland.
The government’s efforts to further improve infrastructure linkages with the PRD are
commendable.

•

Business environment. Frictions in customs approvals and border traffic are an
obstacle to further integration. On the other hand, the authorities are making efforts to
put in place investment policies—including through expansion of the Closer
Economic Partnership Agreements—that will allow Hong Kong firms to raise their
share of domestic Mainland sales and more seamlessly transact across the border.

•

Pollution. The rising pollution spillovers from rapid industrialization in the PRD
threaten to undermine the benefits from further integration. Greater cross-border
efforts are needed to reduce pollution.

•

Human capital. Staff argued for further steps to invest in tertiary education and to
open Hong Kong’s universities to more Mainland students in order to help sustain the
local skills base and build a pool of well-trained professionals with knowledge of
both the Hong Kong and PRD economies.

•

Financial integration. The shifts in trade and goods markets and real sector
interactions with the Mainland have catalyzed financial integration. However, in part
due to the volatility in global financial markets, progress along certain dimensions has
slowed of late (Box 3). Staff saw continued and steady financial integration with the
Mainland as essential, particularly if global financial systems shrink in the coming
years. It was clear that the authorities remain fully committed to making further
progress in this area.

Box 3. Hong Kong SAR: Financial Integration with the Mainland
Following progress along several fronts in 2007, the momentum for increased financial
integration has slowed somewhat, partly a result of policy but mainly due to the downturn in
international capital markets.
Equity markets. The listing of Mainland
firms has grown rapidly since 2002 and now
accounts for over 50 percent of both stock
market turnover and market capitalization.
However, the pace of new equity issuance
has fallen in 2008, largely as a result of
unfavorable global market conditions.

VI. STAFF APPRAISAL
32.
Macroeconomic outlook. Growth should fall noticeably in the coming months. The
slowdown will be reflected in labor markets and unemployment will rise across the course of
the next year or more. Declining asset prices will add to the drag on economic growth. The
easing of domestic demand and declining food and fuel prices should mean that consumer
price inflation falls below 3 percent next year.
33.
Risks. The foremost macroeconomic risk is the turbulence that is still unfolding in
international financial markets. While asset prices have adjusted downwards, the domestic
financial system has proved itself resilient. Nevertheless, in the current environment,
complacency would be a mistake and the authorities will need to be prepared to act
expeditiously should global market volatility further disrupt the workings of the local
financial system or if the negative impact on Hong Kong’s growth prospects becomes more
profound.
34.
Banking sector. All available indicators suggest that Hong Kong’s banking system
remains sound. Bank credit portfolios will probably worsen in the coming months and credit
growth will slow sharply. Hong Kong’s banks have, however, managed risk prudently,
provisioned for losses, and are well positioned to handle a worsening in credit quality. The
authorities are fully prepared to act decisively if necessary. In this regard, the announcement
of a time-bound, blanket deposit guarantee and a contingent facility, that can be activated in
the event there is a need to provide capital to Hong Kong banks, was fully warranted in the
current extraordinary global circumstances.
35.
Interbank markets. Hong Kong’s interbank markets have faced heightened stress
since late September. In large part, this reflects conditions in offshore, (particularly United
States) markets, an increase in global risk aversion, and concern over counterparty risk. The
HKMA’s actions to increase the attractiveness and flexibility of its facilities to provide
liquidity support under extraordinary circumstances were fully appropriate. Along with steps
taken in other jurisdictions, these measures have begun to restore the workings of local
interbank markets, although term lending has yet to normalize. Nevertheless, the scope to
affect Hong Kong dollar interest rates is limited and interbank rates will continue to be
largely determined by external conditions.
36.
Exchange rate regime. The mission continues to support the Linked Exchange Rate
System. It is a simple, transparent exchange rate arrangement that has, over the past 25 years,
proved to be an anchor of monetary and financial stability in Hong Kong SAR.
37.
Financial stability. The financial system has performed well, without significant
market dislocation. The authorities have taken various steps to bolster stability and these
have been carefully considered and calibrated to the situation at hand. This resilience is no
accident. Over the past several years, the government has steadily established a more robust
system of financial supervision and regulation and a sophisticated financial infrastructure.
The ability of the regulatory authorities to step up their supervisory activities in recent

24
months has been impressive. In addition, the substantial attention to contingency planning
and the authorities’ continued willingness to look critically at their current system and
explore areas for further improvement are now fully paying off.
38.
The 2008/09 Budget. Fiscal policy is the principal demand management tool
available to the government. Given the clear downside risks and Hong Kong’s healthy fiscal
position, fiscal stimulus is warranted. The 2008/09 Budget and the supplementary package of
measures introduced in July should help guard against a more dramatic economic slowdown.
The emphasis on improving infrastructure to better integrate Hong Kong SAR with the
Mainland economy will provide long-term benefits. Similarly, investing in human capital
through free secondary school education and support to university level research will help
meet the future demand for skills. Finally, the provision of timely and targeted social
assistance to the elderly and lower income groups is welcome, particularly given the elevated
costs of basic foodstuffs.
39.
The 2009/10 Budget. Continued fiscal stimulus will be needed in the upcoming
budget. The government should target budget balance or a small fiscal deficit for the year as
a whole. The one-off measures of the past couple of years have run their course and should
be allowed to expire. Instead, the time has come for a more fundamental evaluation of the
revenue needs of the government, the appropriate tax structure, and the likely fiscal outlays
over the medium term. Such a medium-term perspective would lead to providing the needed
stimulus through an acceleration of infrastructure investments and possibly a permanent
reduction in direct tax rates. Further adjustments to the tax structure will likely need to be
considered in the coming years. There is also merit in the government providing updated
fiscal forecasts during the course of the year in order to guide expectations, helping to
increase the effectiveness of fiscal policy.
40.
Healthcare. The authorities have rightly recognized that continuing indefinitely with
the current healthcare system is simply not sustainable. Doing so will result in a worsening
quality of care that will be particularly incident on lower income groups and on the older
members of Hong Kong’s population. In addition, without change, healthcare will place an
increasing burden on public finances, crowding out needed spending or necessitating a large
increase in the tax burden. Any reform would need to tackle three broad areas: to ensure cost
containment and efficient provision of services; to discourage extraneous spending through
some form of user fees or other price-based measures; and, if an increase in the tax burden is
to be avoided, to revise the healthcare financing model such that a much larger share of
expenditure, particularly for in-patient care, is picked up by the private sector. From a
macroeconomic perspective, some form of mandatory scheme will be required. Voluntary
schemes run the risk of under-provision for future health costs and greater volatility in
consumption, particularly for lower income groups. An integral part of any reform should be
to maintain public support for those with chronic illnesses, with disabilities, or who have
incomes that are insufficient to generate enough savings to cover their healthcare needs.

25
41.
Competitiveness. Both quantitative models and macroeconomic indicators indicate
that the Hong Kong dollar continues to be valued broadly in line with economic
fundamentals. The current account surplus is consistent with Hong Kong’s position as an
international financial center with a reliance on services and a rapidly aging demographic
profile. The level of the currency is not the only factor determining long-run competitiveness.
Hong Kong SAR has continuously been able to innovate in various areas of the services
industry, steadily raising productivity as a result. In addition, recent progress in moving
towards the adoption of a new competition law that is in line with international best practice
will help enhance competitiveness.
42.
Minimum wage. Rising income inequality and a relatively high share of the
population in lower wage occupations make it natural that society should consider the
introduction of a minimum wage. It is appropriate to make the minimum wage legislation
uniform across employment groupings. Any minimum wage should be set at a level to
protect lower income workers without unduly damaging their employment prospects.
Achieving this balance will be greatly helped by the government’s efforts to improve the data
on low wage labor markets, in order to better understand the structure of the existing wage
distribution. To provide greater employment stability, the authorities should consider a
simple, automatic scheme to adjust the minimum wage over time, based on changes in
relevant indicators such as wages or unit labor costs. In addition, the minimum wage could
be complemented by additional social assistance for the working poor, to better support
lower income groups while mitigating some of the rigidities that may be associated with a
minimum wage.
43.
Developments in the Pearl River Delta. A broader expansion of communications and
infrastructure offers significant potential for further growth and development in the region.
Recent announcements to improve transport linkages and allow Hong Kong companies to
increase their activities in the Mainland will allow that potential to be realized. At the same
time, obstacles such as congestion at customs control points, border traffic, as well as rising
pollution threaten to undermine future prospects. Coordinated efforts will be needed to
minimize these risks and provide a stable and predictable policy environment. In addition,
further investments in tertiary education and in opening Hong Kong’s universities to
Mainland students will help sustain the local skills base and build a pool of well-trained
professionals with knowledge of both Hong Kong SAR and the Pearl River Delta.
44.
Financial integration. Much headway has been made in recent years. While
conditions in international capital markets are difficult, the authorities should continue to find
opportunities to move the process forward, to capitalize on Hong Kong SAR’s first-mover
advantage, and to allow it to play a catalytic role in the modernization of the Mainland’s
financial system and its integration with global capital markets.
45.
It is recommended that the next Article IV consultation discussions take place on the
standard 12-month cycle.

1/ Fiscal year begins on April 1.
2/ This refers to the authorities' measure of operating expenditure.
3/ Operating balance, as defined by the authorities, is akin to the current balance.
4/ Balance excluding investment income.
5/ Staff estimate used to measure the impact of fiscal policy on domestic demand. It excludes asset transactions and
cyclical fluctuations.
6/ The "budget estimate" includes the assumed impact of the fiscal stimulus package announced in July 2008. The FY
2008/09 budget includes a HK$26.5 billion transfer to endow a research fund and supplement MPF contributions, as well
as HK$22.6 billion in capital spending that will be spent in subsequent years. Excluding these items would bring the overall
balance to a surplus of around 2.0 percent of GDP.

ANNEX I: HONG KONG SAR—FUND RELATIONS
I.

Membership Status

As a Special Administrative Region of the People’s Republic of China, Hong Kong SAR is
not a member of the Fund. However, annual consultation discussions have been held with the
Hong Kong SAR authorities since October 1990, and the staff also holds discussions with the
authorities in connection with the Fund’ Global Financial Stability reports. STA has
provided Hong Kong SAR with technical assistance in the area of balance of payments
statistics and Hong Kong SAR officials have attended IMF Institute courses on balance of
payments and monetary statistics, and financial programming.
II.

Exchange Rate Arrangement

The Hong Kong dollar has been linked to the U.S. dollar under a currency board arrangement
since October 1983 at a rate of HK$7.8/US$1. The Hong Kong Monetary Authority
(HKMA) refined the operations of the LERS in May 2005—the first changes since
September 1998. For the first time since the introduction of the LERS in 1983, the HKMA
explicitly committed to sell Hong Kong dollar at a pre-announced price (set at
HK$7.75/US$), which is referred to as the strong-side convertibility undertaking. Previously,
the HKMA had only committed to buy Hong Kong dollar at a pre-announced rate (the
weak-side convertibility undertaking introduced in October 1998) and could sell Hong Kong
dollar at any price. Along with this two-way convertibility undertaking, the HKMA also
introduced a symmetric trading band of 0.6 percent around a central parity of HK$7.8/US$.
There are no restrictions on current or capital account transactions in Hong Kong SAR, and
the Hong Kong dollar is freely convertible. The People’s Republic of China accepted the
obligations under Article VIII, Sections 2, 3 and 4 of the Articles of Agreement on
December 1, 1996.
III.

Resident Representative

The Hong Kong SAR sub-office of the Beijing Resident Representative’s office was opened
on September 23, 2000. Mr. Olaf Unteroberdoerster is the Resident Representative.

3
ANNEX II: HONG KONG SAR—STATISTICAL ISSUES
Data provision is adequate for surveillance purposes. Hong Kong SAR provides statistics to
the Fund on a timely basis for surveillance and publication in the International Financial
Statistics (IFS). Hong Kong SAR subscribes to the Fund’s Special Data Dissemination
Standard and is fully compliant with its requirements.
Hong Kong SAR publishes comprehensive balance of payments data and international
investment position statistics for 2000 onwards, and also publishes quarterly external debt
statistics according to the recommendations given in the External Debt Statistics: Guide for
Compilers and Users.
Hong Kong SAR reports both cash and accrual-based annual data for the general government
according to the Fund’s Government Finance Statistics Manual (GFSM 2001). No subannual
data are provided for publication in the IFS.
Hong Kong SAR participated in the IMF’s Coordinated Compilation Exercise for Financial
Soundness Indicators (FSIs) and its FSI data and metadata for 2005 have been posted on the
IMF website.
Work is in progress on the compilation of monetary statistics using the Standardized Report
Forms that present data consistent with the Monetary and Financial Statistics Manual.

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2008 Article IV Consultation
Discussions with People’s Republic of China — Hong Kong Special
Administrative Region
On December 1, 2008, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF)
concluded the Article IV consultation discussions with People’s Republic of China—
Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (SAR). 1
Background
Hong Kong SAR’s economy has undergone a remarkable metamorphosis over the past
decades. These changes have resulted in almost all manufacturing operations moving
to the Pearl River Delta. At the same time, the economy has leveraged its strong
institutional framework, flexible labor and product markets, and status as a global
financial center to transform itself into a dynamic, knowledge-based, service economy.
Hong Kong SAR has emerged from this process of deep-rooted change with an
enviable growth performance that has averaged 7 percent over the past four years.
Unemployment has fallen to the lowest point in more than a decade, rising disposable
incomes have propelled forward private consumption, and productivity growth has been
high.

1

Under Article IV of the IMF’s Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country’s economic developments and policies.
On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion
by the Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as
Chairman of the Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is
transmitted to the country’s authorities.

2
However, as one of the most open economies in the world and with its focus on financial
and trade services, Hong Kong SAR is highly exposed to the unfolding crisis in
international financial markets and to the slowdown in the global economy. There are
now clear signs of economic deceleration.
Net exports of goods and services fell in the first half of 2008, as the terms of trade
worsened and demand from the E.U., Japan, and the United States weakened.
However, the current account surplus has declined only modestly, in part due to higher
investment income. Portfolio flows have rotated out of equities and into local currency
and deposit holdings.
Consumer price inflation has increased over the past two years, driven by imported food
inflation and an upward trend in the cost of housing. While headline figures have fallen
rapidly in recent months, after adjusting for the effect of recent budgetary measures,
underlying inflation appears to have only just peaked.
In the 2007/08 fiscal year (April–March), the consolidated fiscal surplus was 7¾ percent
of GDP, overperforming the budget target by 6 percent of GDP and helped greatly by
the stock and housing market boom and by buoyant land sales (which generated
3.2 percent of GDP in stamp duties and almost 8 percent of GDP in nontax revenue).
The 2008/09 budget, and a supplementary fiscal package announced in July, introduced
a sequence of measures to return fiscal resources back to Hong Kong SAR’s citizens,
protect lower income groups from food and fuel price increases, and expand
infrastructure spending. The combined budget and supplement now target a fiscal deficit
of ¾ percent of GDP for the 2008/09 fiscal year.
Since the second half of 2007, equity markets have lost two-thirds of their value and
lingering concerns over counterparty risk have raised interbank rates for lending at
longer maturities. In September, unfounded rumors of liquidity problems and losses from
international exposures catalyzed a fleeting retail deposit run at one major retail bank.
This was followed by an increase in interbank rates and tight liquidity conditions,
particularly for term lending. A flight to quality also pushed nominal interest rates on the
government’s Exchange Fund Paper negative for several days. The spot exchange rate
appreciated towards the strong side of the convertibility undertaking, hitting the band in
late October and early November.
Executive Board Assessment
Following several years of impressive economic performance marked by robust growth
and rising disposable incomes, the Hong Kong SAR economy is headed for a marked
slowdown reflecting the crisis in international financial markets and the global economic
downturn. Executive Directors recognized that the authorities’ sound economic policies
and steady strengthening of financial sector regulation and supervision in recent years
have provided valuable protection in dealing with the consequences of the global

3
financial turmoil. In addition, the various steps that the authorities have taken in recent
months have bolstered stability and buttressed the economy’s resilience to spillovers.
These actions, alongside comprehensive and effective contingency planning, have
allowed the authorities to react quickly and pre-emptively to unfolding developments. In
particular, Directors welcomed the authorities’ implementation of a range of measures to
stimulate domestic demand through a sizable fiscal stimulus package, and to preserve
stability by providing liquidity and sustaining confidence in financial markets.
Looking ahead, Directors considered a possible worsening of international financial
market turbulence as the key risk for Hong Kong SAR over the short term. They
expressed confidence that the government is set to act expeditiously if global market
volatility creates further disruption in the workings of the local financial system, or if the
negative impact on Hong Kong SAR’s growth prospects becomes more profound.
Directors were reassured by the resilience of Hong Kong SAR’s banking system to date,
but cautioned that credit growth could slow sharply and credit quality could deteriorate
alongside the economic downturn. Hong Kong SAR’s banks have managed risk
prudently and provisioned for losses, and are well positioned to handle such conditions.
Directors considered the introduction of a time-bound, blanket deposit guarantee and a
contingent facility to provide capital to Hong Kong SAR’s banks as timely and warranted.
Directors reiterated their support for the Linked Exchange Rate System. They viewed it
as a simple, transparent exchange rate arrangement that has, over the past twenty-five
years, provided an anchor for monetary and financial stability in Hong Kong SAR. The
exchange rate arrangement has demonstrated remarkable resilience during the recent
period of turmoil, underpinned by the flexibility of the Hong Kong SAR’s economy.
Directors agreed with the staff’s assessment that the exchange rate is valued broadly in
line with fundamentals.
Directors recognized that fiscal policy is the principal tool to respond to slower growth,
and agreed that the recent stimulus package will help provide support to the economy.
The well-targeted infrastructure investments should boost the economy’s potential by
further increasing skill levels and productivity. Continued fiscal stimulus will also be
needed for the coming year. In the upcoming budget, Directors encouraged the
authorities to take a more medium-term perspective in setting fiscal policy, favoring a
move away from the one-off measures of recent years.
Most Directors agreed that, if substantial increases in the tax burden are to be avoided,
steps will need to be taken to increase private financing of healthcare spending. Greater
cost containment, more efficient provision of services, and some form of user fees will
also likely be needed. An integral part of reform would be to maintain public support for
those with chronic illnesses or disabilities, or for those who have insufficient means to
cover their healthcare needs.

4
Directors noted the authorities’ intention to take forward the introduction of a minimum
wage in a prudent and pragmatic manner. They suggested that such a minimum wage
policy should be designed carefully to avoid distortions and preserve labor market
flexibility. It should be applied uniformly across employment groups, be set at a level to
protect lower-income workers without unduly damaging their employment prospects,
and include a simple, automatic adjustment scheme based on changes in wages or unit
labor costs. The minimum wage should also be complemented by additional social
assistance for the working poor.
Directors saw an expansion of communications and infrastructure aimed at better
integrating with the Pearl River Delta region of Mainland China as an important catalyst
for future growth and development in the region. At the same time, they drew attention
to remaining frictions, including customs control and border traffic as well as rising
pollution, as risks that could undermine future prospects. Opportunities should also be
found to accelerate the process of financial integration with the Mainland.
Public Information Notices (PINs) form part of the IMF’s efforts to promote transparency of the IMF’s
views and analysis of economic developments and policies. With the consent of the country
(or countries) concerned, PINs are issued after Executive Board discussions of Article IV consultations
with member countries, of its surveillance of developments at the regional level, of post-program
monitoring, and of ex post assessments of member countries with longer-term program engagements.
PINs are also issued after Executive Board discussions of general policy matters, unless otherwise
decided by the Executive Board in a particular case. The staff report (use the free Adobe Acrobat
Reader to view this pdf file) for the 2008 Article IV Consultation with People’s Republic of China —
Hong Kong Special Administrative Region is also available.

Statement by the IMF Staff Representative
December 1, 2008

The information below, which has become available following the issuance of the staff
report, does not alter the thrust of the staff appraisal.
1.
Growth. On a seasonally adjusted basis, GDP contracted by 0.5 percent in the third
quarter, following a decline of 1.4 percent in the second quarter. While weak consumption
had been the leading downward force in the first half, third quarter data revealed an
unexpected fall in investment, concentrated in weakening construction activity. A modest
increase in private consumption only partially offset this lower investment while net exports
continued to contribute little to growth. The outturn was below staff’s growth forecast of
0.2 percent.
2.
Inflation. Headline consumer price inflation fell to 1.8 percent in October. After
netting out the impact of fiscal measures, underlying inflation continued to moderate to
5.9 percent, due to lower energy and fuel costs.
3.
Labor markets. Unemployment moved marginally higher to 3.5 percent in October
(from 3.4 percent in the previous month) with job losses concentrated in the retail sector,
transportation, trade, and hotels. Private sector vacancies declined by 13 percent in October
over the previous month.
4.
Exchange rate. The Hong Kong dollar has continued to trade close to the strong side
of the band with the Hong Kong Monetary Authority selling local currency repeatedly as the
exchange rate has hit the band.
5.
Money markets. Interbank lending has continued to normalize. Volumes for term
lending have risen and rates have declined alongside reductions in U.S. dollar rates. Yields
on Exchange Fund Paper have, however, remained close to zero for shorter maturities. The
Hong Kong Monetary Authority recently announced a sale of HK$8 billion of 3-month
Exchange Fund Bills and a special issue of 98-day Exchange Fund Bills to meet the
increased demand for these instruments.
