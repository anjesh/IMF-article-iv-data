BRITISH OVERSEAS TERRITORY
STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2011 ARTICLE IV CONSULTATION DISCUSSIONS
November 15, 2011

KEY ISSUES
Setting: Anguilla has experienced a boom-bust cycle related to the global crisis and
has faced a persistent hangover. This has accentuated weaknesses in the financial
sector and undermined the fiscal position. After sharp output contractions in 2009–10,
growth is still expected to be negative in 2011 and return to positive territory in 2012
with the two major tourism projects getting back on course. The 2011 Article IV
Consultation Discussions represent the Fund’s first formal bilateral dialogue with this
British overseas territory, building on the annual ECCU Common Policies discussions.
Addressing financial vulnerabilities: The most pressing issue is how to deal with
weak indigenous banks, as the downturn has placed strains on the financial system,
seriously affecting asset quality and liquidity. Continued efforts are needed to enhance
nonbank supervision, particularly in light of the failure of two regional insurance
companies, and to improve coordination. An action plan for addressing financial sector
vulnerabilities is needed that spells out the respective roles of the Eastern Caribbean
Central Bank, the Anguillan government, and the Financial Services Commission (FSC)
of Anguilla. The offshore financial sector offers some potential to diversify the
economy, but the balance between the potential economic benefits and costs need to
be weighed carefully.
Rebalancing fiscal policy: A fiscal framework needs to be put in place in line with the
resources available and with an appropriate balance between current and capital
expenditure. An adequate framework would build buffers in good times to allow
countercyclical spending when needed and incorporate a system of tax policy and
administration that would yield sufficient revenue to meet established priorities. A
comprehensive tax reform to simplify the tax structure and broaden the tax base is
needed. Reversing some of the growth in the wage bill, which more than doubled
during the 2003–08 boom, is unavoidable. Within this framework, the 2012 budget
should restore capital spending, cut current spending including wages, and increase
revenue by broadening the tax base.
Enhancing growth prospects: The short-run policy priorities should be to increase
capital spending, improve the business environment including through a one-stop
shop, and address skills shortages through training and greater labor mobility, while
improving access to the island and enhancing diversification in the longer run.

2011 ARTICLE IV REPORT

RECENT DEVELOPMENTS AND OUTLOOK
1.
Anguilla’s per capita GDP is well
above the average for the Caribbean
region. The island has been able to turn its
small size and population (16 thousand),
natural beauty, relative inaccessibility, and
stability as a British overseas territory to its
advantage by establishing a reputation as an
upscale and exclusive tourist destination. It has
also developed a relatively large financial
sector in comparison to the size of its
economy. However, these features also greatly
magnified the boom-bust cycle associated
with the global crisis and have contributed to a
persistent hangover.1
2.
Several large resort projects fueled
a FDI boom which doubled nominal GDP
during 2003–08. The boom affected every
aspect of the economy, with construction
becoming the main driver of activity. Tax
revenue of a transitory nature—particularly on
real estate transactions, FDI-related imports,
and imported labor—increased sharply. Private
sector wages jumped, while the construction
industry imported labor on a large scale. The
government wage bill more than doubled, as
salaries increased by two thirds, and
headcount increased by 45 percent to meet
law enforcement, education, and other needs.
In addition, a greater proportion of
government expenditure was devoted to
transfers. The size of the banking system
doubled, with a portfolio concentrated in real
estate lending.

3.
The bust has been nearly as
dramatic as the boom it followed. One of
the two major FDI projects stalled in 2008 after
running out of financing.2 With the onset of
the global crisis in 2009, real GDP fell by
17 percent and the fiscal situation deteriorated
sharply. Revenue collapsed while expenditure
remained elevated after the increases during
the boom years. Despite drastic cuts in capital
spending in 2009 and a reduction in salaries of
about 7 percent on average, the overall deficit
grew to 8 percent of GDP, financed largely by
expensive short-term overdraft facilities,

Eastern Caribbean Central Bank (ECCB).

4.
Economic activity and government
revenue continued to slow in 2010, despite
a recovery of the high-end tourism sector.
To stabilize the fiscal accounts, the new
government that took office in early 2010
introduced revenue measures, further reduced
average salaries by 3.5 percent and froze salary
increments, curtailed goods and services
spending, and cut capital spending further to
an extremely low level. These measures and an
European Union grant of over 4 percent of
GDP reduced the overall deficit by
6 percentage points of GDP.
5.
The reduction in the overall balance
in 2010 reflected in part financing
constraints. Overall public debt had increased
sharply to 25 percent of GDP at end-2010—
relatively high for a small undiversified
economy (but not high by regional standards).
Commercial banks which faced tight liquidity
called in loans to government. In addition, the
UK Government determined that it was unable
to permit disbursement of a US$18 million
(6 percent of 2009 GDP) Caribbean
Development Bank (CDB) loan approved in
2008 to upgrade the ferry port because the
authorities did not deliver a business case
demonstrating Anguilla’s ability to repay the
expected loan costs and remain within the
official borrowing guidelines.3 The government

The 2011 budget represents a
determined fiscal effort by the government
to meet its commitment to the UK to
balance the overall budget by the start of
2013. The UK delayed approval of the original
budget to allow for an assessment by external
consultants, whose recommendations were
taken to double the customs surcharge and to
increase the specific gasoline tax at the import
stage.4 These and other approved measures
are aimed at increasing tax revenue by
EC$ 21 million (2.7 percent of GDP). The
consultants recommended additional revenue
measures in 2012 to balance the budget in
that year.

3

The guidelines require keeping: (1) debt below
80 percent of current revenue; (2) debt service below
8 percent of current revenue; and (3) cash reserves for
90 days of operations. The last guideline was the first
to be breached.

7.
The global crisis has placed pressure
on the financial sector. There are
2 indigenous banks and 2 foreign banks
operating in the jurisdiction. Total assets
amount to 276 percent of GDP, with a market
share for indigenous banks of 75 percent. The
asset portfolio of the banking system, which is
concentrated in construction, tourism, and
personal loans, deteriorated during the
downturn, with the ratio of nonperforming to
total loans increasing to 36 percent by
end-June 2011 in the indigenous banks. The
liquidity situation also remains tight.
8.
The pickup in inflation due to
higher global food and fuel prices is not
expected to persist. Reflecting upward
pressure from prices of imported food and fuel,
inflation is expected to rise further to 5 percent
in 2011 before reverting, given the anchor of
the currency peg.

2011 ARTICLE IV REPORT

9.
Despite a number of encouraging
developments, the staff’s outlook for
growth is cautious. One major tourism
project has exited receivership into ownership
by an established investment group which is
well placed to enhance operations. A bid has
also been made for another major project,
which had been stalled since 2008 before
construction was complete. Furthermore,
Anguilla’s share of ECCU and of Caribbean
stayover arrivals is recovering, and the
resilience of its high-end tourism sector
notwithstanding high unemployment in source
countries is an advantage. However, the tepid
global outlook will still weigh on the economy.
Staff forecast an additional contraction in 2011
reflecting the drag of fiscal policy and lower
FDI, and a modest recovery in 2012. Going
forward, the growth outlook depends on a
recovery of capital spending, implementation
of the ferry port project and the pace of global
economic recovery.

POLICY ISSUES
The key policy challenges facing Anguilla are addressing financial sector weaknesses,
rebalancing fiscal policy, and enhancing growth prospects.

A. Addressing Financial Sector Vulnerabilities
10.
The downturn has significantly
affected the banking system. The system was
already suffering before the crisis from a
concentrated portfolio which grew rapidly
during the boom period. The indigenous
commercial banks and their offshore
subsidiaries have weak financial positions.
They have lending and equity linkages to other
ECCU banks which provide a potential channel
for contagion. The NPLs of foreign banks have
increased sharply in 2011, with low

provisioning, but these are backed by the
foreign parent.5
11.
The most pressing issue is how to
deal preemptively with weak banks since a
failure of one institution could trigger a
generalized loss of confidence in the region.
Furthermore, given the expected slow recovery,

5

Foreign banks have limited their linkages to
indigenous banks.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

5

2011 ARTICLE IV REPORT

UNITED KINGDOM–ANGUILLA–BRITISH OVERSEAS TERRITORY

the banking system will continue to be under
stress. The recent intervention in the largest
indigenous bank in Antigua and Barbuda
underscores the importance of prompt and
preemptive resolution.
12.
Staff emphasized that a
comprehensive regional approach to
problems in the ECCU’s banking system is
needed. The authorities are encouraged to
support the work of a joint regional task force
being formed to determine the size of the
liquidity and capital shortfalls in indigenous
banks, assess direct and indirect linkages, and
develop resolution strategies. Supervision is
fragmented, with the parent banks supervised
by the ECCB and their offshore bank
subsidiaries by the Financial Services
Commission (FSC) under the UK-appointed
Governor of Anguilla. Recent efforts to
improve coordination have had limited success
due to limited sharing of information,
attributed to confidentiality restrictions. An
action plan for addressing financial sector
vulnerabilities should therefore also spell out
the respective roles of the Eastern Caribbean
Central Bank, the Anguillan government, and
the FSC of Anguilla.
13.
The authorities concurred that
action is overdue to shore up the banking
system. They agreed that a regional approach
was needed, and given fragmented supervision
that greater coordination as required, with a
clear delineation of roles.
14.
The resolution of the failed BAICO
and CLICO insurance companies has been a
source of continuing uncertainty, and
regional efforts to resolve these companies
are still ongoing. Banks have made progress
in provisioning for their exposures. A regional
strategy is being pursued aimed at

6

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

maintaining BAICO as a going concern, and a
judicial manager has been appointed for
BAICO Anguilla as in other ECCU members. In
the case of CLICO, Anguilla is relying on the
judicial manager appointed in Barbados, the
home jurisdiction.

15.
The insurance sector appears
healthy apart from the difficulties of CLICO
and BAICO. However, the authorities are
encouraged to continue progress toward
strengthening insurance industry regulation
and to enact harmonized insurance legislation
now under consideration.
16.
Anguilla is considering expanding its
offshore financial sector as part of efforts
to diversify the economy. Recent research
has confirmed that strong governance attracts
offshore business, and that a well-regulated
offshore sector can contribute to growth.
However, the economic benefits of expanding
the offshore sector will need to be carefully

UNITED KINGDOM–ANGUILLA–BRITISH OVERSEAS TERRITORY

weighed against the associated regulatory
costs. While the authorities have made
progress in strengthening the anti-money
laundering and combating the financing of
terrorism regime, they need to implement fully
the recommendations made in the June 2010
Caribbean Financial Action Task Force
assessment report. In this respect, the plan to
review the governance of the company registry
is welcome and should aim at preventing the
unlawful use of legal persons, and particularly

2011 ARTICLE IV REPORT

International Business Companies, by money
launderers.
17.
The authorities supported the
regional approach to resolving the
CLICO/BAICO issue. They noted that Anguilla
was among the first in the region to set up a
single regulatory unit for the nonbank sector,
and were making progress toward enacting
modern insurance legislation. Their strategy for
the offshore financial sector is still being
defined.

B. Rebalancing Fiscal Policy
18.
A fundamental rebalancing of fiscal
policy is needed, beginning with the 2012
budget. If not for windfall stamp duty from
the sale of a major project, the fiscal outturn
for the first half of 2011 indicates revenue
would fall EC$ 12 million short of budgetary
projections for the full year, due primarily to a
weak outturn for taxes on international
transactions. The staff projects an overall
deficit of EC$ 20 million for 2012 assuming a
conservative estimate for the stamp duty
revenue, a constant wage bill, and the return
of capital spending to the historical average,
which the staff recommend. This would imply
that the additional revenue measures of
EC$ 8 million that were recommended by
external consultants would not be sufficient to
achieve an overall balance.
19.
Reversing some of the sharp
growth in the wage bill will be necessary to
balance the budget in 2012, as foreseen by
the authorities. After the increase of two
thirds during 2005–08, salary reductions in
2009–10 lowered the wage bill by about
10 percent. Furthermore, the wage cuts took
the form of temporary salary suspensions
which do not affect pensions and with the

prospect of eventual partial or full

Because full reimbursement has been granted

perceived as an entitlement creating potential
future budget pressures.
20.
An overall balance could be
achieved in 2012 through a combination of
revenue and expenditure measures. On the
revenue side, the Tax Reform Working Group
has recently finalized its recommendations in
time for incorporation in the 2012 budget.
Making progress with tax reform would be
preferable to implementing further ad hoc
measures. On the expenditure side, the 2012
budget should begin reining in the wage bill
and reflect the findings of the OECS Public
Expenditure Review Commission to be
published in the near future. While these
measures would be a drag on growth, the
momentum from major tourism projects is
expected to sustain a recovery.
21.
Given financing restrictions and
economic vulnerabilities, Anguilla needs to
put in place a fiscal framework in line with
the resources available and with an
appropriate balance between current and
capital spending. An adequate framework
would build buffers in good times to allow for
countercyclical spending when needed and
incorporate a system of tax policy and
administration that would yield sufficient
revenue to meet established priorities. An
illustrative medium-term projection (Table 6)
which holds the nominal wage bill constant
while increasing capital expenditure to its
long run average underscores that restoring
sustainability is feasible but only if there is
also early action as discussed above. However,
there are significant downside risks if the
external environment deteriorates or tourism
projects lose momentum.
22.
The official borrowing guidelines
by themselves are not sufficient as a fiscal

8

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

framework. A broader Framework for Fiscal
Responsibility under discussion with the UK
would shift emphasis toward developing a
Medium-Term Fiscal Plan as a context for
annual budgets, with improved project
appraisal and evaluation, more transparent
procurement, and stricter management of
actual and contingent liabilities. The approach
would be embodied in a new public financial
management law.
23.
The new framework could specify a
clear fiscal anchor in the form of a target
for public sector debt as a percent to GDP.6
Given that Anguilla has a small non-diversified
economy subject to natural disasters and
other shocks, it would be appropriate to set a
target which is significantly lower than the
60 percent of GDP target set by the ECCU
Monetary Council to be achieved by 2020 by
ECCU members. The ECCU Common Policies
Discussions Staff Report presents the case
that an appropriate target for the region
would be toward the lower end of the
25-45 percent range identified in the
literature. With a clear fiscal framework in
place, Anguilla could consider asking the CDB
to reappraise the ferry port loan (6 percent of
GDP).
24.
A comprehensive tax reform is
needed to restructure the current
inefficient and inequitable tax system
(Box 2). Currently, only about 40 percent of
imports bear positive rates of duty, while
20 percent of imports enjoy duty concessions.
The tax reform should simplify the tariff
structure; impose excise taxes on fuel, alcohol,

6

The existing borrowing guidelines relate debt and
debt service to current revenue, which has been
volatile as described above.

UNITED KINGDOM–ANGUILLA–BRITISH OVERSEAS TERRITORY

tobacco and other goods with inelastic
demand; and introduce a VAT/GST and a
permanent income tax to broaden the tax
base and to minimize distortions.7
25.
Significant efforts have been made
to improve tax administration. Inland
Revenue began to impose penalties for late
filing in late 2010, which have already
increased compliance. There has also been
progress in reducing tax arrears. To upgrade
the technology platform for customs
administration, Anguilla introduced a pilot site
for ASYCUDA World in December 2010.
Priority areas for further improvement include
moving towards an organization based on
function and taxpayer size (rather than tax
type), strengthening audit capacity, and
upgrading the IT systems.
26.
Anguilla has made some progress in
improving public financial management
through several ongoing initiatives, but
further work is needed. CARTAC is assisting
in a review of the budget process to improve
fiscal discipline and the reliability of the
budget. In addition, it is providing assistance
in improving macroeconomic forecasting and
assessing the budget implications of new
policy initiatives. Finally, there is an effort to
implement commitment-based accounting
and to improve expenditure control and the
monitoring of expenditure arrears.
27.
There is significant scope to
improve the quality of expenditure. One
important step would be to implement
performance-based salary increments based
upon a pilot project under way. There is also a
7

VAT with one exception where implementation is

2011 ARTICLE IV REPORT

need to enact legislation that has been
drafted to create a centralized procurement
function with transparent procedures for
tenders. The targeting of social programs to
the truly vulnerable can be improved, drawing
upon the nearly finalized Country Poverty
Assessment. There is a need to establish a
reliable capital program with a multi-year
horizon based upon cost-benefit analysis
within an overall economic strategy. Public
private partnerships could be considered for
projects where risks are shouldered by the
private sector.
28.
Statutory bodies rely heavily on
central government subsidies. The
government should work on a medium-term
plan to reduce the dependence of statutory
bodies (about 4 percent of GDP) on subsidies
by eliminating duplicated functions and
charging adequate fees for services.
29.
Social Security Board (SSB) reserves
will last until around 2040. The SSB has an
asset base of EC$ 250 million (33 percent of
GDP), including EC$ 11 million claims on the
failed British American Insurance Company
(BAICO). There is some scope for the SSB to
shift its portfolio from liquid assets which bear
little or no interest toward higher yielding
investments abroad and carefully selected
domestic investments.
30.
The authorities shared the staff’s
concern about fiscal imbalances. They
noted their efforts to restore fiscal
sustainability in the last two budgets, while
pointing to their limited room for maneuver
given financing constraints, the weak
economy, and the difficulty of rolling back
entitlements.

UNITED KINGDOM–ANGUILLA–BRITISH OVERSEAS TERRITORY

C. Enhancing Growth Prospects
31.
Although the growth outlook has
improved, a number of serious concerns
remain. Access to the island needs to be
improved, for instance, by upgrading ferry
port and extending the runway to
accommodate larger jets. The market for
villas, which has a significant impact on
construction activity, is still recovering from
the global crisis.
32.
In addition, the unbalanced and
procyclical fiscal policy has created an
environment which is not conducive for
growth. Capital spending during the last
1½ years has been only 0.4 percent of GDP at
an annual rate. The right to draw the CDB
ferry port loan expired earlier this year. A
fiscal environment that is supportive to
economic growth, including through
adequate public investment, will be essential.
33.
Some features of the labor market
are also an obstacle to growth. Anguilla
became a high labor cost environment during
the boom period driven by increasing
government salaries and by private sector
demand for labor. However, private and
public sector labor productivity did not
improve in tandem, and there is a shortage of
skilled labor. A call center recently relocated
from Anguilla due in part to high labor costs.
More importantly, the top echelon resorts
operating in Anguilla will require a volume of
highly skilled talent difficult to satisfy without
sharply improved training and greater
flexibility to import talent while domestic
capacity is being developed.
34.
Given the island’s high dependence
on tourism, greater diversification is

10

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

needed. Improving the business environment,
for instance by establishing a one-stop shop
for foreign investors, would support these
efforts. Further development of the offshore
financial sector has some promise, but there
are important tradeoffs to consider as
discussed above.
35.
Global fuel and food price shocks
are placing upward pressure on prices in
2011, particularly affecting the most
vulnerable. Anguilla is vulnerable to such
shocks, as was seen during 2007–08. The
authorities should encourage full passthrough
of changes in international prices, in
accordance with a 2008 ECCB Monetary
Council decision, while buffering the impact
on vulnerable groups through targeted
assistance.
36.
There are some indications that the
exchange rate is overvalued (Box 1). The
equilibrium real exchange rate approach
suggests that the exchange rate is in line with
fundamentals, while the macroeconomic
balance and external sustainability
approaches imply the rate is overvalued. Any
assessment must be highly qualified given the
significant data limitations.
37.
The authorities shared the
assessment that the policy environment
was not conducive for growth. In particular,
they agreed that fiscal policy was not
sufficiently supportive, and that additional
public investment was urgently needed, which
would facilitate diversification. They
underscored their desire to build the
domestic skills base to maximize backward
linkages from FDI to the local economy.

UNITED KINGDOM–ANGUILLA–BRITISH OVERSEAS TERRITORY

2011 ARTICLE IV REPORT

STAFF APPRAISAL
38.
Anguilla is recovering from severe
boom-bust cycle related to the global
financial and economic crisis. This has
accentuated weaknesses in the financial sector,
undermined the fiscal position, and pushed the
island into recession. Urgent action is needed
to improve the health of the financial sector, to
stabilize public finances, and to increase the
potential for long-run economic growth.
39.
Close cooperation will be needed to
address financial sector vulnerabilities,
particularly those related to the indigenous
banks. A preemptive response as part of a
regional strategy led by a joint task force being
formed could minimize costs and risks. The
strategy will need to strengthen the banks’
capital and clean up their balance sheets. An
action plan should spell out the respective
roles of the ECCB, the Anguillan government,
and the FSC of Anguilla.
40.
A new fiscal framework is needed
with an appropriate balance between
current and capital expenditure and in line
with the resources available. Fiscal policy
should be designed to meet the combined
objectives of debt sustainability, deficit
reduction, and long-term economic growth.
Given financing constraints and economic
vulnerabilities, the government needs to
accumulate buffers during good times to allow
for countercyclical spending during
slowdowns. As part of the new framework, the
2012 budget should restore capital spending
to historical levels, cut current spending

including wages, while ensuring adequate
revenue given financing constraints.
41.
In this context, the inefficient and
inequitable tax system needs to be
reformed. A comprehensive tax reform should
simplify the tax structure and broaden the tax
base. A general consumption-based tax such
as a VAT/GST and a permanent income tax
would attain both objectives. The complex
system of customs duties and exemptions
should be replaced with a tariff with few rates
and limited exemptions.
42.
The tourism sector, the driver of the
economy, has begun to recover, benefiting
from its high-end focus. Prospects have
brightened now that the two major tourism
projects are getting back on track. However,
air and sea access to the island needs to be
improved.
43.
A fundamental course change is
needed to increase the potential for longterm GDP growth and reduce its volatility.
The short-run policy priorities should be to
increase capital spending, improve the
business environment including through a
one-stop shop, and address skills shortages
through improved training and greater labor
mobility. In the longer run, the focus should be
on improving access to the island and
enhancing diversification, which would reduce
the volatility of real GDP growth rates. There
are some indications that the exchange rate is
overvalued, but the evidence is not conclusive,
and there are significant data limitations.

Box 1. Exchange Rate Assessment
The customer- and competitor-based real
effective exchange rates (REERs) have recently
been on a broadly declining trend. Following a
sharp appreciation in 2008 corresponding to global
food and fuel price increases, the customer-based
real effective exchange rate has been depreciating,
reflecting U.S. dollar depreciation against the major
customer currencies, while the competitor-based real
effective exchange rate has broadly been on a
declining trend since 2007.

The assessment of the exchange rate using CGER
methodologies is constrained by significant data
limitations.
The fundamentals-based equilibrium real
exchange rate approach suggests that the actual
real effective exchange rate has been close to its
long-run equilibrium value in recent years.1 The
actual rate has been converging toward its
equilibrium from 2004 onwards.
The macroeconomic balance approach points to
an overvaluation of the exchange rate. This
approach indicates that the current account (CA)
norm is minus 18.9 percent of GDP against the
underlying CA of minus 25.7 percent. Closing the
gap between the norm and the actual CA in the
medium term would require a depreciation of
22.9 percent.

The external sustainability approach indicates an
overvaluation of 58.4 percent.2 The net foreign
asset stabilizing CA is minus 8.3 percent of GDP
while the underlying CA is minus 25.7 percent
difference of about 17 percentage points, reflecting
in part the projection of increasing FDI.

1/ An increase (decrease) indicates an appreciation (depreciation).
2/ The sharp movements in the competitor-based real exchange rate in
2002–04 were largely driven by the Dominican Republic’s peso.

Unlike the standard CGER methodology, capital
account transfers including grants were included in the
estimation for the ECCU region, as they represent an
important source of financing.

2011 ARTICLE IV REPORT

Box 2. The Tax System in Anguilla
Anguilla’s tax revenue is disproportionately
concentrated in a few volatile and transitory
revenue sources. The largest revenue source in
2011 is stamp duty (EC$ 51 million), accounting for
nearly 29 percent of total recurrent revenue, mostly
from a single property transaction. This amount is
three times the level in 2010. Three of the largest
revenue items, stamp duty, import duty on items
other than fuel and alcohol, and work permits, are
particularly volatile due to the cyclical nature of their
tax bases. The extreme volatility of the major
revenue sources is an obstacle to undertaking multiyear capital projects.
The tax system is inefficient and inequitable with
a narrow tax base. Taxes on imports, a crucial
revenue source, are imposed unevenly and narrowly.
It is estimated that approximately 40 percent of
import duty revenue is lost due to concessions and
exemptions. The inefficiency of taxation is
aggravated by the fact that similar products can be
subject to different rates of import duties, leading to
distortions.

The tax system is also overly complex. This
reflects in part an accumulation of ad hoc measures.
Furthermore, there are a large number of fees and
licenses, as well as a number of nuisance taxes. It is
hoped that the Tax Reform Working Group will
propose a simpler, more efficient, and more
equitable tax system that is more buoyant and less
volatile.

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2011 Article IV Consultation
Discussions with United Kingdom–Anguilla–British Overseas Territory

On November 28, 2011, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF)
concluded the first ever Article IV consultation discussions with United Kingdom–Anguilla–
British Overseas Territory.1
Background
Anguilla has experienced a boom-bust cycle related to the global crisis and faces a
persisting hangover. Several large resort projects fueled a FDI boom during 2003–08,
which doubled nominal GDP. The stalling of one of these projects and the global crisis led
to declines in real GDP of 16.5 percent in 2009 and 5.9 percent in 2010 respectively. The
fiscal situation deteriorated sharply as revenue collapsed while expenditure remained
elevated after the increases during the boom years, notwithstanding a series of fiscal
measures.
The downturn has accentuated strains on the financial system. The asset portfolio of the
banking system, which is concentrated in construction, tourism, and personal loans, was

1

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country or territory, collects economic and
financial information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and
policies. On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for
discussion by the Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director,
as Chairman of the Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is
transmitted to the country's authorities. An explanation of any qualifiers used in summings up
can be found here: http://www.imf.org/external/np/sec/misc/qualifiers.htm.

adversely affected, and the ratio of nonperforming loans to total loans in the indigenous
banks increased to 36 percent by end-June 2011.
The growth outlook is improving with the major tourism projects getting back on course,
though a slow recovery is only expected to begin in 2012. Risks are tilted to the downside
given the global outlook. Nevertheless, balancing the overall budget by the start of 2013
will be challenging.
Executive Board Assessment
The Executive Directors noted that the severe boom-bust cycle related to the global crisis
has accentuated weaknesses in the financial sector, undermined the fiscal position, and
pushed the island into recession. They concurred that urgent action is needed to improve
the health of the financial sector, to stabilize public finances, and to increase the potential
for long-run economic growth.
Directors agreed that close cooperation will be needed to address financial sector
vulnerabilities, particularly those related to the indigenous banks. They recommended
developing a strategy to strengthen the banks’ capital and clean up their balance sheets
and underscored the need for an action plan which could usefully spell out the respective
roles of the key players.
Directors emphasized that a new fiscal framework is needed with an appropriate balance
between current and capital expenditure and in line with the resources available. Fiscal
policy should be designed to meet the combined objectives of debt sustainability, deficit
reduction, and long-term economic growth. Given financing constraints and economic
vulnerabilities, they urged the government to accumulate buffers during good times to allow
for countercyclical spending during slowdowns. As part of the new framework, they
suggested that the 2012 budget restore capital spending to historical levels, cut current
spending, while ensuring adequate revenue given financing constraints.
Directors welcomed efforts toward reforming the inefficient and inequitable tax system.
They supported a comprehensive tax reform that would simplify the tax structure and
broaden the tax base. They noted that a general consumption-based tax such as a
VAT/GST and a permanent income tax would attain both objectives. The complex system
of customs duties and exemptions should be replaced with a tariff with few rates and
limited exemptions.
Directors noted that the tourism sector, the driver of the economy, has begun to recover,
benefiting from its high-end focus. They were encouraged that prospects have brightened
now that the two major tourism projects are getting back on track. However, they
recognized that air and sea access to the island needs to be improved.

Directors agreed that a fundamental course change is needed to increase the potential for
long-term GDP growth and reduce its volatility. They recommended that the short-run
policy priorities be to increase capital spending, improve the business environment
including through a one-stop shop, and address skills shortages through improved training
and greater labor mobility. In the longer run, the focus should be on improving access to
the island and enhancing diversification, which would reduce the volatility of real GDP
growth rates.
Directors welcomed the Anguillan authorities’ initiative in proposing the first ever Article IV
Consultation Discussions, which had usefully informed the 2011 Eastern Caribbean
Currency Union Common Policies Discussions and hoped that the close dialog developed
would continue.
Public Information Notices (PINs) form part of the IMF's efforts to promote transparency of the IMF's
views and analysis of economic developments and policies. With the consent of the country
(or countries) concerned, PINs are issued after Executive Board discussions of Article IV consultations
with member countries, of its surveillance of developments at the regional level, of post-program
monitoring, and of ex post assessments of member countries with longer-term program engagements.
PINs are also issued after Executive Board discussions of general policy matters, unless otherwise
decided by the Executive Board in a particular case.

ANNEX II: ANGUILLA’S RELATIONS WITH THE
CARIBBEAN DEVELOPMENT BANK
(As of June 30, 2011)
The Caribbean Development Bank (CDB) has
approved loans totalling US$106.5 million, of
which US$1.1 million are undisbursed.

Major Projects:
1.
Policy-Based Loan— is intended to
support the Government of Anguilla’s
medium-term reform programme to achieve
fiscal and debt sustainability, thereby creating
the conditions for overall economic growth
and poverty reduction. The PBL assisted the
Government to: (a) restructure its public debt
to reduce debt service payments by
lengthening the maturity structure and
reducing the rate of interest on some of its
public debt; (b) strengthen the framework for
fiscal and economic management for
sustained improvements in the fiscal position;
and (c) support and maintain social safety nets
to cushion the worst effects of the adjustment
measures on the most vulnerable in the
country.
2.
Fifth Consolidated Line of Credit—the
provision of a loan of US$5 million to assist the
Anguilla Development Bank in continuing its
lending programme in the agriculture,
industry, tourism, housing, education sectors
and small and medium enterprises. The

4

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

Project is to assist in: (a) financing technically
sound and financially viable projects in the
productive sectors (agriculture, industry,
tourism and services related to those sectors)
and (b) improving human resource capacity for
Anguilla by upgrading skills at the technical,
vocational and professional levels.
3.
Fifth Power Project— consists of the
purchase and installation of two generators of
approximate size 3.5 MW and ancillary
switchgear, associated civil works, extension to
the power house, the installation of a fuel tank
and provision of an instrumentation and
control system. The project will provide
additional generating capacity to satisfy
projected electricity demand and to replace
existing engines that are past their useful lives.
4.
Natural Disaster Management Project—
to contribute to the rehabilitation of economic
infrastructure caused by Hurricane Lenny. The
project consists of rehabilitating a Bypass road
and drainage structures and repairs to other
infrastructure and public buildings. The
project promotes the reduction of vulnerability
to natural disasters through support for the
development and adoption of mitigation
policies, standards and practices.

UNITED KINGDOM–ANGUILLA–BRITISH OVERSEAS TERRITORY

ANNEX III. STATISTICAL ISSUES
As of November 15, 2011
I. Assessment of Data Adequacy for Surveillance
General: Macroeconomic statistics have some shortcomings, but are broadly adequate for
surveillance. There are shortcomings in coverage, accuracy, frequency, and timeliness. Priority
should be given to compilation and dissemination of labor market data and tourism data.
Real Sector: National account data are based on the 1993 System on National Accounts. They
are compiled and disseminated annually; Anguilla does not disseminate quarterly GDP data.
Anguilla recently rebased its national accounts to base year 2006 for the period 2000 to 2009 and
new GDP data have 2006 for the base year. The rebasing led to a significant increase in the
nominal GDP due to an extension of data compilation to previously underestimated sectors and
activities, for example communication. GDP data by type of expenditure are not available at
constant prices. Private final consumption expenditure is estimated as a residual. Monthly CPI
data are reported regularly but with a long lag. An important weakness of macroeconomic
statistics is the lack of appropriate labor market data.
External Sector Statistics: The Eastern Caribbean Central Bank monitors the external sector in
collaboration with member countries’ statistical offices. BOP data are published annually in a
format that is consistent with the fifth edition of the IMF Balance of Payments Manual. There are
no data on private external debt.
Government Finance Statistics: The data on central government finances are published by the
ECCB and are broadly in line with the methodology in the Government Finance Statistics Manual
1986. The data are published annually with a lag of approximate six months.
Monetary and Financial Statistics: Monetary data are compiled by the ECCB on a monthly basis
and reported regularly to the Fund. There is a need to improve the institutional coverage that
currently only comprises the ECCB and commercial banks.
II. Data Standards and Quality
Anguilla does not participate in the General
No data ROSC is available.
Data Dissemination System.
III. Reporting to STA
The authorities do not report fiscal data for publication in the IFS. The ECCB provides monetary
and financial statistics data to STA.
