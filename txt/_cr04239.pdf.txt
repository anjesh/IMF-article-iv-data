Staff Report for the 2004 Article IV Consultation
Prepared by the Staff Representatives for the
2004 Consultation with Nigeria

June 22, 2004

•

The 2004 Article IV consultation discussions were held in Abuja and Lagos during
February 23-March 8 and May 12-19, 2004. Staff representatives were Mr. Katz (Head),
Mr. McDonald (March mission), Mr. Bartsch and Ms. Gobat (all AFR), Ms. Ongley (PDR),
Mr. Baunsgaard (March mission), Mr. Villafuerte (May mission) (both FAD) and
Mr. Thiam (Senior Resident Representative). The mission collaborated with the World Bank
resident mission. Mr. Atoloye (Advisor to Mr. Usman, Executive Director for Nigeria)
participated in the March discussions.

•

The mission met with a range of senior officials, including the Minister of Finance,
Minister of Federal Capital Territory, Governor of the Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN),
Chief Economic Advisor to the President, Permanent Secretary of the Presidency, and other
senior officials. The mission also met with representatives of the oil sector, business
community, civil society, and international community in Nigeria, as well as members of
the National Assembly and ruling party.

•

At the conclusion of the 2002 Article IV consultation in December 2002, Directors
expressed concern about the inconsistent progress in implementing reforms and the large
and persistent macroeconomic imbalances. Directors endorsed the broad economic strategy
recommended by staff. In particular, they agreed that, following the elections, it would be
critical to formulate a coherent strategy centered on a prudent macroeconomic framework,
measures to strengthen economic management, public sector transparency and
accountability (starting with the oil sector), and financial sector and public debt
management. This would set the stage for more far-reaching reforms to address Nigeria’s
deep rooted structural challenges.

•

Nigeria has not yet accepted the obligations of Article VIII (Sections 2-4), but no longer
maintains restrictions under Article XIV. Nigeria maintains multiple currency practices.

-4EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
With the long legacy of poor overall macroeconomic management, achieving
macroeconomic stability and sustainable growth in Nigeria continues to pose a formidable
challenge. Overall economic performance over the past 18 months has been mixed. Real
GDP growth accelerated in 2003 due to higher oil production. However, fiscal policy was
procyclical, and monetary policy expansionary. As a result, inflation accelerated,
international reserves declined and the currency appreciated in real terms.
However, macroeconomic developments in early 2004 have been encouraging, with
considerable oil savings achieved through fiscal restraint, signaling a reversal of the
expansionary policies of the past. Moreover, the new economic team has quickly articulated
its homegrown reform program—the National Economic Empowerment and Development
Strategy (NEEDS)—aimed at addressing Nigeria’s deep-rooted macroeconomic and
structural challenges. Reforms to enhance oil sector efficiency, public sector transparency
and accountability, fight corruption, and strengthen the financial sector have been initiated.
The main challenges in 2004 are to restore macroeconomic stability, generate savings from
the oil windfall to protect against future oil price declines, and enhance the transparency and
predictability of macroeconomic policies. Progress has been made in strengthening the
federal budget process, reducing nonpriority outlays, and increasing investments in key
priority areas in line with the NEEDS’ objectives, such as education, health, agriculture,
water, and electricity. The critical challenge facing the authorities is to convince the states to
participate in the fiscal rule to save windfall oil revenue. Timely passage of the Fiscal
Responsibility Bill would provide the legal underpinning for prudent consolidated fiscal
policy at all levels of government.
The conduct of monetary policy will be critical to supporting the disinflation strategy. The
CBN should develop a credible communication strategy to enhance accountability for
monetary policy. Interest rates should be allowed to adjust, and excess liquidity should be
absorbed through market-determined instruments. Reforms also should be considered to
strengthen the CBN’s independence and further enhance the soundness and stability of the
banking system. The exchange rate should be market-determined.
The development of NEEDS signals a clear break in Nigeria’s macroeconomic management.
NEEDS’ commitments are broadly consistent with the recommendations of the 2002
Article IV consultations. Staff strongly supports the authorities’ focus on fighting corruption
and promoting good governance in public institutions, and welcomes Nigeria’s participation
in the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI) and establishment of the Economic
and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC). However, the challenges facing the government
are formidable. Consistent policy implementation will be essential to enhancing prospects for
successful reforms. In this context, it would be important to begin the 2005 budget cycle
early, develop a medium-term expenditure framework, and accelerate the structural reform
agenda, particularly with regard to privatization, unification of the foreign exchange market,
and civil service reforms. Staff welcomes the authorities’ request to monitor as part of
intensified surveillance efforts the implementation of their program on a quarterly basis, and
is committed to providing policy advice and helping build institutional capacity in Nigeria.

-5I. INTRODUCTION
1.
Overcoming the long legacy of poor overall macroeconomic management poses a
formidable challenge for achieving macroeconomic stability, sustainable growth and
poverty reduction in Nigeria. The high level of macroeconomic volatility brought about by
boom-bust oil revenue cycles and procyclical fiscal policies have been a central impediment
to achieving macroeconomic stability and sustainable growth. Oil windfall gains have led to
rapid increases in government spending, and monetary policy has been accommodative of the
pro-cyclical fiscal stance. Along with inflexible exchange rate policies, these procyclical
macroeconomic policies have resulted in price volatility, appreciation of the real exchange
rate as well as instances of currency instability.
2.
Inefficient public spending and mismanagement of oil revenues have impeded
economic and social development. Substantial increases in public spending over the past
three decades have not been matched by an improvement in the country’s standard of living.
Most poverty and social indicators compare unfavorably to sub-Saharan African averages,
with over two-thirds of the population living in poverty. In addition, Nigeria’s infrastructure
and public utilities are ranked among the worst internationally.1 Together with the highly
unpredictable macroeconomic environment, a protective trade regime, as well as disregard
for the rule of law, these inefficiencies have distorted economic incentives, and resulted in
widespread corruption and rent-seeking practices, and have adversely affected investment
and development of the non-oil economy.
3.
Notwithstanding these challenges, prospects for far-reaching economic and
structural reforms have improved significantly since the 2002 Article IV consultation.
In April 2003, Nigeria successfully achieved a peaceful transition from one civilian
administration to another, for the first time since independence.2 President Obasanjo
announced a second and final-term commitment to implement far-reaching economic and
social reforms, with a view to leaving a restructured, more dynamic Nigerian economy as his
fundamental legacy. He subsequently appointed a new team of well-respected economic
technocrats, who have moved quickly to define and begin implementing a medium-term
reform agenda. These commitments and appointments to the cabinet, along with the
1

Of 24 countries assessed in the World Economic Forum’s Africa Competitiveness Report
(2000-01), Nigeria’s roads, railways, ports, and airports ranked lowest, and
telecommunications second to last. Frequent power outages, recurrent fuel shortages, costly,
unreliable telecommunication services and inefficient port services (cargo congestion and
high clearing costs) have added sharply to the cost of doing business in Nigeria.
2

President Obasanjo won the presidential elections with 62 percent of the eligible votes cast.
His People’s Democratic Party also won the majority of seats in the National Assembly and
succeeded at the state assembly and gubernatorial elections. International observers agreed
that the conduct of the elections varied widely, with substantial irregularities in some areas.
However, they concluded that President Obasanjo would have won the elections in the
absence of these irregularities.

-6People’s Democratic Party’s (PDP) comfortable majority, present a unique window of
opportunity to undertake meaningful reforms in Nigeria—a view shared by the
international community. The window for reform is narrow, with the next election cycle
expected to begin around mid-2006.
4.
Since mid-2003, the authorities have intensified their dialogue with staff.
Missions visited Abuja during August/September and October 2003 to assist in strengthening
the budget process and developing a prudent macroeconomic and budget framework
for 2004.3 Furthermore, the authorities have developed a homegrown reform program—the
National Economic Empowerment and Development Strategy (NEEDS), which is broadly
consistent with the recommendations from the 2002 Article IV consultation. Most
importantly, several recommendations have been implemented at the federal level such as the
oil-price based fiscal rule, enhancing governance practices, starting with the oil sector,
strengthening the budget process and improving policy coordination through the introduction
of the Cash Management Committee. At this juncture, the authorities have indicated they will
not seek formal Fund support, but have requested that the Fund monitor the implementation
of their economic program on a quarterly basis as part of intensified surveillance efforts.
II.

BACKGROUND

Economic performance over the past 18 months has been mixed. Despite favorable
developments in the real economy, overall macroeconomic policies have been expansionary.
However, the government moved quickly to articulate NEEDS, aimed at addressing Nigeria’s
deep-rooted macroeconomic and structural challenges. Moreover, macroeconomic
developments so far in 2004 have been encouraging, with considerable oil savings achieved,
signaling a reversal of the expansionary policies of the past years.

The visits overlapped with joint FAD/World Bank technical assistance missions on budget
preparation and pension reform. Additional discussions were held in London in July 2003,
and in Washington with the Minister of Finance in late 2003 and early 2004.

Total oil production increased by 25 percent to 2.45 million barrels per day (mbd) in 2003.

-7and telecommunications. The areas under cultivation and production of key crops have
expanded over the past four years. The authorities noted that aside from another good rainfall
year and firmer prices, the agricultural sector is reacting positively to initiatives aimed at
enhancing harvesting techniques, farmers’ access to credit and seedlings, as well as
expanding irrigation systems and feeder roads. Due to favorable terms of trade developments,
the external current account deficit narrowed sharply (Figure 2). This, however, masks
rising non-oil import pressures and a widening non-oil external current account deficit.
6.
Fiscal policy was procyclical and expansionary in 2003, with the non-oil primary
balance deteriorating as a percent of non-oil GDP (Figure 3). Although the federal
government achieved some tightening, this was more than offset by higher spending of the
oil windfall by state and local governments (SLGs). The expansionary policies reflected, in
part, commitments carried over from 2002, including those related to the national elections
and All-Africa games. The overall deficit would have been higher, had the federal authorities
not introduced several measures to restrain spending in the second half of 2003, particularly
with regard to the capital budget and the supplementary budget that was approved in early
December 2003, and enhanced revenue collection.5 Government oil revenue improved in the
final quarter of 2003 after the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) was
required to pay the market price for crude oil allocated for domestic refining.

of 2003. Notwithstanding signs of rising

inflationary pressures, and well above target

reserve and broad money growth, the CBN
-60
reduced the minimum rediscount rate (MRR) to
15 percent in July 2003—MRR is the policy
interest rate applied to all transactions within
the CBN’s discount window—the third reduction within a year. Lax monetary conditions led
to a monetary overhang and negative real short-term interest rates by end-2003 and
early 2004 (Figure 4).
Execution of the supplementary budget was largely limited to domestic debt servicing,
underprovided in the 2003 budget. The president announced in June 2003, before the
appointment of the new economic team, the monetization of in-kind benefits (such as
housing and furniture allowances) and their extension to all federal government employees
from a narrow group of senior officials. However, the monetization reforms were postponed
to 2004 and reexamined for affordability.

Inflation accelerated in 2003 on the
back of expansionary macroeconomic
policies and fuel price liberalization
(Figure 5). While nonfood inflation—
30 percent of the consumer price index—
began to pick up as first quarter of 2003,
overall inflation accelerated sharply starting
in the second half of 2003 with the
government’s policies to liberalize gasoline
prices. The authorities estimate that fuel
price liberalization directly impacted the
consumer price index by at least
seven percentage points in 2003.6

9.
Gross public debt continued to rise as the federal government resorted to a
mixture of market-based and monetary financing to finance its expansionary policies.7
As a result of further arrears accumulation and valuation effects, external debt increased by
US$2 billion to US$32.8 billion at end-2003 (57 percent of GDP).8 Nevertheless, the
authorities made efforts to improve relations with Paris Club creditors, through enhanced
dialogue regarding the allocation of cash debt service payments and all but four bilateral
negotiations concluded under the 2000 rescheduling agreement.
10.
Despite record high oil revenue, and in
contrast with developments in most major oil
exporting economies, international reserves
continued the downward trend that started
in 2002. The decline moderated, following the
introduction of the Dutch auction system (DAS)
in mid-2002, but the authorities—through higher
average DAS sales— resisted a depreciation for
most of 2003. Although the CBN allowed for a

This does not include second round effects. Fuel and transportation account for about

The federal government issued N 72 billion in long-term domestic bonds to the market in
October 2003—its first bond issue since 1987—and N 92 billion in 91-day treasury bills at

External debt service payments increased to US$1.8 billion in 2003 from US$1 billion
in 2002, allowing Nigeria to fully service its commercial and multilateral debt, but still
accumulating new arrears of US$1.2 billion in 2003 to Paris Club creditors.

Macroeconomic conditions improved considerably since late 2003, due largely to
fiscal prudence (and the delay in appropriating the 2004 budget). The fiscal restraint that
began in the last quarter of 2003 continued in

the first four months of 2004. Around

Consequently, 12-month growth in broad
money slowed considerably in the first four
months, and foreign exchange market pressure
eased, facilitating a sharp increase in gross international reserves to US$10 billion at
end-April 2004, and a narrowing of the parallel market exchange rate premium to
4½ percent. In addition, inflation moderated in the first quarter to 22½ percent at
end-March 2004.
12.
Structural reform efforts have been positive since mid-2003. Several initiatives to
improve oil sector efficiency and enhance public sector transparency and accountability were
introduced as part of NEEDS (see below). First, the price subsidy to the Nigerian National
Petroleum Company (NNPC) on its domestic crude allocation was eliminated in
October 2003. Furthermore, prices on retail petroleum products were liberalized. The
president also replaced the Group Managing Director of NNPC, a move widely seen as
enhancing the efficiency and transparency of NNPC. Second, the authorities volunteered to
participate in the EITI and agreed to participate in the African Peer Review Mechanism of
the New Partnership for Africa’s Development (NEPAD) and the G8 transparency initiative.
Third, the financial sector and the payment system were strengthened in line with Financial
Sector Assessment Program (FSAP) recommendations (Box 1).
13.
Overall trade protection, however, increased due to ad hoc changes to Nigeria’s
trade regime. While Nigeria’s tariff structure and the tariff gap with its trading partners
remain largely unchanged,9 numerous import bans were introduced,10 leaving its rating on the

Some effort was made in 2003 to reduce tariffs applied to certain goods which would have
led to a lowering of the weighted average tariff.

launched a formal review of the trade regime, with a view to streamlining Nigeria’s tariff
structure from 20 to 4 tariff bands (0, 5, 10 and 20 percent) in line with the Economic
Community of West African States’ (ECOWAS) common external tariff. These reforms are
expected to take effect in mid-2004. Nonetheless, the authorities indicated that they would
continue to use import bans as a protective
instrument.

B. NEEDS and Initiation of Reforms
15.
Within a relatively short time frame, the authorities have developed a comprehensive
strategic vision for addressing Nigeria’s deep-rooted macroeconomic and structural
problems. NEEDS is Nigeria’s federal government homegrown poverty reduction strategy
that aims at achieving higher sustainable economic growth, lasting poverty reduction, and
meeting the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs).11 It signals a clear break from past
practices of economic policy formulation: it is both wide-ranging in scope and specific in
identifying key objectives, accompanying measures, timing and accountable agencies.
16.
The NEEDS priorities are broadly consistent with the recommendations of
the 2002 Article IV consultation and, if implemented effectively, should lay the
foundation for sustainable economic growth. The core objectives are to create an
environment conducive to investment, growth of the non-oil economy and poverty reduction
by (i) achieving macroeconomic stability through the implementation of a transparent, rulesbased fiscal framework and the adoption of a market-determined exchange rate system;
10

The current import prohibition list includes 28 categories banned for importation for
commercial or retail purposes and 19 categories banned for commercial and personal use.
11

See Appendix VI for the MDG goals and VII for the draft NEEDS policy matrix outlining
key reform areas such as the macroeconomic framework, public expenditure and governance
reforms, the fight against corruption, and privatization. Following consultations with
stakeholders, NEEDS is expected to be cleared by the Federal Executive Council, President
and National Executive Council, and then endorsed by the National Assembly around
July 2004.

- 15 Box 1. Financial Sector Reforms
Since late 2002, the authorities have strengthened the overall effectiveness of the financial
sector—including the payment system—in line with the recommendations of the 2002 FSSA
report. The authorities have not addressed forcefully the problem of distressed banks, however.
In part, this reflects weaknesses in the court system as well as some political interference in the
process. Several reforms to upgrade the financial infrastructure are expected to go into effect in
the third quarter of 2004. These should help improve banking supervision and effectiveness of
liquidity management. The key reforms introduced or planned include:
•

From January 1, 2004, the risk-weighted capital adequacy ratio was increased from
8 percent to 10 percent. Banks’ minimum capital will be raised from N 1 billion to
N 2 billion at end-2004. Banks raised their capital largely through rights issues.

•

Consolidated banking supervision was enhanced through establishing the Financial
Services Coordination Committee (including staff from the CBN and NDIC) and
developing a common manual governing procedures for supervision, examination and
assessment. The CBN and Nigeria Deposit Insurance Corporation (NDIC) have begun
supervising the financially weak community banks.

•

Amendments to the Banking and Other Financial Institutions (BOFI) Act are planned, but
not yet signed into law by the National Assembly, to bring Nigeria’s regulatory and
supervisory framework in compliance with Basle Core Principles and FSAP
recommendations.

•

The CBN has strengthened regulations governing insider lending and large shareholders
(e.g., defining lending to large shareholders and directors as part of insider lending) with
stiffer penalties (e.g., loss of equity stake in the bank) for misreporting and noncompliance.

•

All 21 CBN branches have been linked electronically under the wide area network since
late 2003. This has helped improve day-to-day liquidity operations as the CBN can now
capture daily consolidated movements of all bank deposits with the CBN headquarter and
its branches.

•

On April 1, 2004, a new settlement system went into effect. A small number of sound
banks are now responsible for the clearing system. This is expected to reduce the incidence
of overdrawn balances with the CBN, enhance monetary control in the process, and result
in consolidation of the banking industry.

•

Several important reforms will go into effect in the third quarter of 2004, including the real
time gross settlement system (RTGS); global bank reporting system (Globus system); and
electronic Banking Analysis System (eBAS). This will give the CBN access to daily bank
returns, and allow a move to average reserve requirements. It would also allow the
authorities to capture on a daily basis banks’ naira and foreign exchange positions
(including open positions), and better assess impact of open market operations on base and
broad money. The eBAS also would help banking supervision, while moving toward
RTGS would reduce settlement risks. The cost of developing RTGS is being borne by the
CBN.

The authorities have requested a follow-up FSAP mission in order to assess progress made
since the last assessment and identify further areas for strengthening.

- 16 (ii) enhancing the effectiveness and efficiency of public spending through public expenditure
management, procurement and civil service reforms, and reorienting public spending toward
pro-growth and pro-poor priorities such as water, electricity, roads, agriculture, health and
education; (iii) promoting the private sector by addressing acute infrastructure bottlenecks,
privatizing and deregulating the utilities and transportation sectors, liberalizing the trade
regime, and strengthening the financial sector; and (iv) addressing systemic corruption and
rent-seeking behavior through improved transparency and accountability of all public
institutions. However, NEEDS falls short on spelling out the role of monetary policy and the
financial sector in overall macroeconomic management and economic development in the
Nigerian economy.
17.
NEEDS aims at achieving a medium-term annual growth of 7–8 percent in the
non-oil economy, equivalent to real per capita income growth of about 4 percent, while
maintaining single digit inflation, raising gross international reserve coverage to
7–8 months of imports (goods), and reducing the public debt burden to sustainable
levels. Such sustained high growth rates are necessary to halve poverty by 2015 to meet the
MDGs.12 The authorities estimate that about 7 million jobs will need to be created
between 2004–2007 to absorb those currently under- and unemployed and those expected to
join the labor force. They also note that policies to stimulate the rural economy will be
critical as more than half of the population lives in rural areas where poverty remains
widespread and deep.
18.
Central to the government’s reform efforts is the emphasis on strengthening the
accountability and transparency of public policies, fighting systemic corruption in
public institutions, and enforcing the rule of law. The authorities believe that weak
governance practices have considerably eroded the effectiveness of public institutions and
policies in Nigeria, and have been a root cause for Nigeria’s poor economic performance and
stalled reform efforts. In the area of fiscal reforms, important guidelines have been
established to improve the process underlying the formulation, presentation, and
implementation and monitoring of the 2004 budget (Box 2). In addition, several critical
reforms have been launched to enhance transparency and tackle systemic corruption (Box 3).
The key reform priorities in NEEDS on the budget process, civil service, privatization and
deregulation, trade, debt management, governance as well as the financial sector are
discussed in Chapter 3.
19.
The federal government has initiated discussions with subnational governments
on a nationally coordinated reform strategy. With half of the oil-related revenue
transferred to the lower level of governments, policy coordination between the three tiers of
government will be critical in achieving NEEDS’ objectives. The subnational governments
have, in principle, agreed to develop their own reform agenda—State Economic
Empowerment and Development Strategy (SEEDS). This is intended to create, for the first
12

The World Bank estimated in 1999 that about 70 percent of Nigeria’s 130 million people
live below US$1 a day.

- 17 Box 2. Budget and Fiscal Transparency Reforms
Under new leadership, the Ministry of Finance (MOF) has been at the forefront of the reform
initiatives in Nigeria. Several steps have been taken to strengthen their ability to implement
sound and consistent fiscal policies, and to enhance the predictability and transparency of fiscal
policies. The MOF, along with the Bureau for Public Services and other agencies, has taken the
lead in reforming the public expenditure management system with the aim to identify wasteful
spending and reorient government priorities toward policies and programs that are pro-poor
and pro-growth. Several of the budget process reform initiatives reflect recommendations of
previous FAD missions and of the joint FAD/World Bank technical assistance mission that was
conducted in August 2003 on budget preparation. Main reforms that have been undertaken over
the past 9-12 months:
•

The Budget Office of the Federation’s (BOF) capacity has been upgraded through the
hiring of qualified professionals. For the first time, a fiscal strategy paper has been put
together for the preparation of the 2004 budget. This paper specified priorities and realistic
macroeconomic assumptions, which facilitated internal discussions on trade-offs and
priorities.

•

The National Assembly was consulted early in the budget formulation process. This helped
to improve working relations between the executive and legislative branches which had
been a major reason for delays and unrealistic budgets in the past.

•

As part of the fiscal strategy paper, indicative capital budget ceilings were set to help
rationalize and streamline projects. Criteria for selecting projects were established (high
completion rate, due process certification, and alignment with government priorities).
Certain areas were given top priority, including agriculture, primary education, basic
health, power, roads, and water.

•

The Economic Team, headed by the president and including high level government
officials involved in economic policy making, now meets on a weekly basis. In addition, a
high level Cash Management Committee (CMC) was established to monitor and reconcile
monthly expenditure releases and strengthen overall budget execution, and determine
borrowing requirements.

•

Major spending ministries have been asked to develop performance indicators and report
on a monthly basis. A special monitoring unit was established for the largest capital
projects.

The authorities upgraded the budget speech, and for the first time produced a budget overview
booklet (following similar practices in Canada and South Africa). They also announced the
intention to publish quarterly budget reports and the audited accounts of the federal
government. This information, including the NEEDS policy matrix, can be found on the
MOF’s website: http://www.fmf.gov.ng.

- 18 -

Box 3. Transparency and Anti-Corruption Reforms

The authorities have undertaken several initiatives to enhance the transparency of
public policies and the use of public resources as well as to fight corruption.
The authorities announced their participation in the Extractive Industries
Transparency Initiative (EITI) in mid-2003. They have since established a broadbased stakeholder working group and developed terms of reference for a
comprehensive independent audit of the oil sector (including the government’s oil
accounts, NNPC, and international oil companies). An internationally reputable auditor
is expected to be selected by mid-2004. The Ministry of Finance has also established a
unit to support EITI-related activities and strengthen its ability to forecast oil revenues.
The government has also agreed to participate in the G8 Transparency Initiative.
Furthermore, the authorities have begun publishing on a monthly basis the revenue
sharing among the three tiers of government.
The government also announced plans to reform NNPC and make it commercially
oriented. As a first step, NNPC is now required to pay market prices for crude oil
allocated for domestic production. NNPC’s executive director was replaced and
10 percent of the workforce (1,400 workers) was retrenched in November 2003.
In terms of public sector accountability more generally, efforts are under way to
reduce rent-seeking practices in customs, including a more streamlined management
structure and a new Comptroller-General. Procurement reforms and extending due
process to all ministries and parastatals are being pursued to reduce the government’s
operating costs and strengthen governance.
As part of their anti-corruption campaign, the Anti-Money Laundering (AML) Act was
amended, and a Financial Intelligence Unit was established in January 2004 within the
Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC), to investigate crimes under
the Act. The authorities have requested technical assistance from LEG to review recent
reform efforts in this area. Since its inception about a year ago, the EFCC has pursued
aggressively the so-called “419” fraud and other crimes. Currently, 53 cases are under
prosecution and about N 10 billion has been recovered. The EFCC’s staff increased
from 80 to 315, and its budget for 2004 doubled.
The Independent Corrupt Practices Commission’s (ICPC) existing 55 plus cases
include several high profile cases of ministers, top civil servants, and judges. Also, the
ICPC legislation was amended to allow for accelerated prosecution.

- 19 time, a coordinated macroeconomic policy framework, including sectoral strategies in
priority areas (e.g., agriculture, basic health, primary education, roads, and water) and more
clearly spelled out roles and responsibilities for the various tiers of government.
III. REPORT ON THE DISCUSSIONS
20.
Discussions focused on short- and medium-term challenges as well as the
appropriate policies to implement NEEDS. Key parts of the economic strategy for 2004 is
to reduce macroeconomic volatility, lower the inflation rate, generate savings from the oil
windfall to protect against future oil price declines, and enhance transparency and
predictability of macroeconomic policies. Overall, the implementation of a rules-based fiscal
policy and a reserve money targeting framework would remove an important source of
volatility and support the authorities’ disinflation strategy. However, the critical challenge
will be convincing all subnational governments to participate in the rules-based fiscal policy
framework and having the CBN assume the leading role in the disinflation strategy.
21.
Given the magnitude of challenges and institutional capacity constraints, the
discussion also centered on the need for prioritization and sequencing. Entrenched
governance concerns continue to portend significant risks for reform implementation.
However, early policy actions aimed at promoting a streamlined and more effective
government will require significant coalition building. For example, the authorities cited the
need for broad-based support at all tiers of government, in order to receive approval for the
proposed Fiscal Responsibility Bill. Hence, the immediate focus will need to be on a few
meaningful reforms yielding the highest returns, to further garner public support.
A. Short-Term Outlook
22.
Overall, staff shared the authorities’ view that the short-term outlook will be
dominated by developments in the oil sector and fiscal policy implementation. Staff
concurs with the authorities’ macroeconomic projections for 2004, including the overall GDP
growth projection of 4.1 percent in 2004. This assumes average crude oil production of
2.5 mbd, slightly higher than the production level achieved in 2003. With a favorable outlook
for oil prices, the external current account should move into a small surplus and gross
international reserves would increase to US$12.5 billion (6.1 months of imports). Tighter
monetary policy is aimed at reducing inflation to a 10-13 percent range by end–2004.
However, the projected widening of the consolidated non-oil primary deficit makes it more
difficult to achieve this target.
B. Fiscal Policy
23.
While the 2004 federal budget entails a tightening of fiscal policy, the
consolidated fiscal stance is projected to remain expansionary.
•

The federal budget for 2004—signed into law by the President on April 21, 2004—
aims at achieving substantial savings in oil revenue and a large cash surplus. The

- 20 budget was framed at the conservative oil price of US$25 per barrel, and the crude oil
production level of 2.5 mbd.13 The federal government will save oil revenue in excess
of this benchmark price and production level (equivalent to 4½ percent of GDP). At a
projected average oil price of US$33.5 per barrel, there would be a cash surplus of
about 4 percent of GDP for the year—an historical achievement, resulting also in a
lower net public debt burden.14
•

Whereas the consolidated overall balance is projected to reach a sizable cash surplus,
the fiscal stance would be

needed to ensure an improvement in the non-oil primary balance.

13

The Executive budget proposal was initially framed at an oil price of US$ 23 per barrel,
but this was subsequently revised upwards to US$ 25 per barrel by the National Assembly.
The budget is based on 2.24 mbd crude oil production by the joint ventures between the
NNPC and international oil companies and 0.26 mbd in production through alternative
licensing arrangements to reach 2.5 mbd.
14

The 2004 budget provides for cash debt service payments of US$1.8 billion, implying a
further accumulation of external arrears to Paris Club creditors. The authorities are
discussing with creditors the allocation of cash payments for 2004.
15

The non-oil primary balance more appropriately reflects discretionary fiscal policy, and
hence, is a better measure of the fiscal stance in an oil-producing economy such as Nigeria
(see IMF Working Paper 02/177; Washington: International Monetary Fund).

- 21 24.
In line with the priority areas under NEEDS, the budget allows for higher nonoil investments and key measures have been introduced to control government consumption:
(i) limit monetization to existing recipients of in-kind benefits; (ii) enforce a civil service
hiring freeze and conduct a payroll audit and physical verification of personnel in selected
ministries; (iii) impose a hard budget constraint on federal parastatals; (iv) allow for pension
payments to all retirees while developing an equitable and affordable strategy for clearing
pension arrears; and (v) reduce overhead costs.
25.
Budget execution will be the critical test. Discussions with the authorities focused
on ways to strengthen budget execution and monitoring. Several of the staff
recommendations to strengthen budget execution have been implemented. In particular, in
early 2004, a Cash Management Committee (CMC) was established to monitor and reconcile
monthly expenditure releases and determine borrowing requirements consistent with cash
flow projections. The authorities noted that the CMC had been effective in ensuring fiscal
restraint in the first four months and enhancing the transparency and certainty on timing of
cash releases. Furthermore, with the assistance of staff, the authorities have developed
quarterly paths for fiscal spending, revenue, and financing for monitoring the execution of
the 2004 federal budget.16
26.
The authorities also recognize the risks posed by the pro-cyclical spending of
subnational governments. They noted that although excess oil proceeds from all three tiers
of government had been set aside for the first four months, there remains the risk that the oil
windfall will be spent. In their view, it would be prudent to assume for the baseline scenario
that only 12 states will save the oil windfall in 2004. Gaining momentum to increase state
participation is critical to achieving macroeconomic stability and will depend on a number of
factors. Allowing the states to keep individual savings accounts at the CBN would be helpful,
but for this to be meaningful, understandings on the triggers for use would need to be
reached. The authorities reiterated the importance of the timely finalization and passage of
the Fiscal Responsibility Bill, as this would provide the legal foundation for applying more
formally a fiscal rule at all levels of government over the medium term. The consultative
process with SLGs has already begun and presentation of the Bill to the National Assembly
is expected in late 2004.
C. Monetary and Exchange Rate Policy
27.
Monetary policy has been operating in a highly volatile environment with fiscal
dominance. Under the new economic leadership and with commitment to fiscal prudence,
staff discussed with the CBN the monetary framework for 2004 to ensure consistency with
the disinflation objective and the need for the CBN to assume the leading role.
16

A temporary domestic borrowing need may arise in the second quarter largely because of
the bunching of the capital budget and the federal government’s reluctance to draw on the oil
revenue saved during the first four months, which has been placed in a blocked account with
the CBN. If warranted, the authorities indicated that they plan to cover this financial need by
going to the market and temporarily using its overdraft facility with the CBN.

- 22 28.
The CBN has developed a quarterly monetary framework consistent with the
authorities’ fiscal and macroeconomic framework. The 2004 monetary program targets a
twelve-month reserve money growth of about 8 percent and broad money growth of
16 percent, which is consistent with lowering inflation to a 10-13 percent range by end2004.17 The expected large cash surplus in 2004 by the federal government would result in a
sharp decline in net claims on the federal government by the banking system and allow for an
increase in international reserves. As designed, the monetary program provides for adequate
private sector credit growth and gross international reserve accumulation of about
US$5 billion. A key objective for 2004 is the rebuilding of international reserves to reduce
the economy’s vulnerability to sharp movements in the international price of oil.
29.
While staff considers the CBN’s quarterly monetary policy framework
appropriate, it pointed to the risks of achieving the end-2004 inflation target, namely:
(i) the expansionary fiscal policy stance at the consolidated level is not supportive of the
disinflation process; (ii) inflation expectations may be deeply entrenched given the weak
track record on macroeconomic stability; (iii) the component of the price index that may be
directly affected by monetary policy is relatively small given the large share of food in the
price index; (iv) the quarterly reserve money path is sensitive to assumptions on the money
multiplier and velocity—both of which have displayed sharp variations; and (v) the CBN
may lack instrument independence to pursue the disinflation objective.
30.
Staff discussed the implications of a situation in which the 12 states do not save
the oil windfall. This would result in an additional N 180 billion in monetized oil revenue,
equivalent to 30 percent of end-March 2004 base money. The authorities indicated that they
would mop up the increased liquidity through open-market operations, including, if
warranted, the possibility of issuing CBN bills as they did in early 2001. They stressed,
however, that if fiscal policy were to loosen significantly, it would be politically difficult for
them to raise the MRR as this could lead to higher interest rates and be detrimental to
NEEDS’ objectives of higher economic growth. CBN officials would instead favor corrective
fiscal measures. They emphasized that they would consider using direct controls such as
raising the cash reserve requirement (CRR) and/or shifting of deposits of nonfinancial public
enterprises from commercial banks to the CBN as well as allow for lower accumulation of
net international reserves.
31.
Staff acknowledged that if all states were to spend the oil windfall, achieving the
end-year inflation target could be costly to the non-oil economy. In this event, there could
be scope for some relaxation of the reserve money and international reserve targets while
allowing for a higher inflation range. However, these deviations should be kept to a
minimum, and it would be critical that the exchange rate and interest rate be allowed to
adjust as needed to meet the authorities’ targets. In this regard, staff stressed that the CBN’s
reluctance to raise the MRR in response to excess liquidity in the financial system was
inconsistent with the reserve money targeting program and would undermine the disinflation
17

CBN’s operational inflation target is 11½ percent—the midpoint of the inflation target
range. Reserve money declined by 7.8 percent in the first quarter of 2004.

- 23 objective. Staff further pointed out that raising the CRR and/or shifting the deposits of the
public enterprises to the CBN would result in higher interest rates. Staff further stressed that
such operations would be ineffective if the MRR were not allowed to adjust in line with
tighter money market conditions as banks would have the incentive to turn to the CBN’s
discount window, undermining reserve money targeting.18
32.
Staff underscored the importance of allowing the exchange rate to be marketdetermined. Since the real exchange rate could appreciate further owing to the terms of trade
improvement and expansionary fiscal policies at the consolidated level, it would be important
that the CBN avoid exerting additional upward pressure through excessive foreign exchange
sales.
33.
More generally, staff highlighted the uncertainties in dampening inflation
expectations and the importance of establishing a credible monetary program. In this
regard, regularly communicating the objectives, instruments and stance of monetary policy to
the public would be critical. An effective communication strategy would (i) assess the
monetary and inflation outlook; (ii) where applicable, explain the reasons for deviations in
performance and the implications for the disinflation objective as well as policy measures to
bring monetary policy back on track; and (iii) monitor closely economic indicators (such as
parallel market premium and foreign exchange demand) that contain forward-looking
information on inflationary expectations. The CBN representatives felt that their existing
practices fulfilled many of these objectives, but staff contended that the information made
available to the public should go beyond a general description of the movement of policy
variables and focus more on an analysis of the factors driving monetary and inflation
developments, and the policy response. Subsequently, the CBN agreed to reassess its
communication policy.
34.
Staff also encouraged the CBN to consider further reforms to strengthen the
conduct of monetary policy and the CBN’s de facto independence. More restrictive
access to the discount window—by raising the cost of borrowing from the CBN above the
interbank offer rates and above treasury bill rates—would strengthen the CBN’s control over
its reserve money base. Staff also recommended that the CBN advances to the federal
government be reduced with the statutory limit on the overdraft facility gradually lowered
from 12½ percent of current year projected revenues to 5 percent, in line with limits set in
other African countries, and subsequently phased out. This would remove an important
source of base money creation. Finally, the domestic debt management reform should permit
the CBN to completely remove itself from the primary government securities market.
35.
Nigeria’s foreign exchange markets are still segmented and a source of
distortion.19 Nigeria is one of a few remaining countries with multiple markets and
18

On occasion, the MRR fell also below the treasury bill rate, creating an arbitrage
opportunity for banks.
19

There are two main markets—the Dutch Auction System (DAS) and the interbank market.
There is also a Bureau de Change and a parallel market. Funds are not transferable between
(continued)

- 24 administrative and documentation requirements for purchasing foreign exchange are
onerous.20 Staff stressed the need to unify the foreign exchange markets and reduce the
parallel market premium. Staff discussed the possibility of transforming the current retail
foreign exchange auction to a wholesale auction, allowing banks to bid for foreign exchange
on their own account and transact these resources among themselves. This would call for
measures to strengthen prudential regulations on working balances, open positions, and
reporting requirements. The authorities indicated that they had considered this option and
their intention was to unify the foreign exchange markets, but felt that further technical
assistance was needed to first strengthen the underlying market infrastructure. The CBN
favored technical assistance that could jointly review foreign exchange and domestic
liquidity management practices.
36.
Eliminating the parallel market premium will require complementary structural
reforms, including streamlining foreign exchange documentation requirements and
implementing trade reforms. Staff observed that unifying foreign exchange markets would
likely involve a modest exchange rate depreciation which could make the disinflation process
more challenging.
37.
The authorities indicated their commitment to wider regional integration within
the planned West African Monetary Zone (WAMZ), but clarified that these
commitments do not yet constitute a legally binding agreement. Staff suggested that
moving to a fixed exchange rate by 2005 may not be feasible in light of lack of convergence
of WAMZ economies and the asymmetric nature of external shocks. Although the
establishment of fiscal discipline should help, the need for foreign exchange market
unification and greater exchange rate flexibility to absorb shocks in Nigeria may be
inconsistent with the conditions for joining a currency union.
D. Proposed Intensified Surveillance Framework
38.
The authorities believe that a formal Fund arrangement at this juncture would
be politically unacceptable, but that they would strongly benefit from an enhanced
dialogue with the Fund. In their view, Fund policy advice and technical assistance in key
reform areas are critical in helping them build capacity and ensure consistency of policy
implementation. As such, they have asked staff to assist them in developing a quarterly fiscal
the markets. The existence of an official exchange rate, together with the interbank rate gives
rise to multiple currency practices in the absence of a mechanism to ensure that spreads
between the official rate and the other rates do not exceed 2 percent at any given time.
Similarly, the DAS, because it is a discriminatory auction, gives rise to a multiple currency
practice. These practices are subject to Fund approval under Article VIII. The authorities also
have not indicated immediate plans to accept the obligations of Article VIII.
20

For instance, under the DAS, banks purchasing foreign exchange on behalf of their clients
(end-users) are required to provide multiple documents to verify the “legitimacy” of
“approved” transactions, and make detailed reports on the uses of the foreign exchange.

- 25 and monetary framework for their program and evaluate its implementation on a quarterly
basis. Staff agreed to the authorities’ request for intensified surveillance on the following
basis:
(i)

The authorities’ 2004 macroeconomic program and structural reform agenda as
described in this report—in particular, the quarterly projected budgetary and
monetary paths (Tables 7, 8a and 8b) and a matrix of structural reforms in key areas
of NEEDS (Appendix VII)—would provide the basis for the assessment;

(ii)

The program and quarterly framework is wholly that of the authorities and has not
been negotiated with staff;

(iii)

Staff would visit Nigeria each quarter and would prepare six-month reports for the
Executive Board’s information, which will assess developments, focusing on core
areas of Fund competence, update risks relating to the authorities’ program, and in
that light, provide advice on the policy changes that may be needed; and

(iv)

Publication of these reports would not be required, but staff understands that the
authorities plan to publish both this Article IV and subsequent interim staff reports.

39.
Staff underscored the importance of timely and regular provision of key
macroeconomic data.
E. Medium-Term Prospects
40.
Staff considers that NEEDS provides the basis for improved medium-term
economic prospects in Nigeria. Staff agreed with the overall policy thrust of NEEDS, but
cautioned against overly optimistic medium-term growth projections, suggesting that it may
take time to translate NEEDS into higher savings, investment and productivity gains.
Substantially higher savings will be forthcoming when stability in policy-making firmly
takes hold, financial sector soundness improves, and the government builds a credible track
record of economic performance and good governance. Hence, staff was inclined to be more
cautious about the supply response and prospects for accelerated growth.
41.
Staff’s baseline scenario projects growth to average 5 percent over the medium
term, and assumes that the non-oil sector reaches its potential growth of 5–5½ percent as the
private sector, in particular agriculture, responds to market-oriented reforms. The baseline
scenario assumes that the Fiscal Responsibility Bill is signed into law by 2005 and that all
subnational governments introduce an oil price-based rule by 2006. As such, the consolidated
fiscal stance gradually converges to balance at the oil price of US$20 per barrel by
2008–09.21 At the federal government level, capital spending increases to 5 percent of GDP,
with a higher pro-poor and pro-growth content, while payroll and overheads decline in line
21

For a further discussion on the application of the permanent oil price-based rule in Nigeria,
see Nigeria: Selected Issues and Statistical Appendix, IMF Country Report No. 03/60.

- 26 with public expenditure reforms. Similar public expenditure management reforms among
SLGs is assumed to adjust spending in real terms over the medium term. Inflation is
projected to fall gradually to 5 percent by end-2009. Owing largely to higher public savings,
national savings increase to 21 percent of GDP by 2009, and with improved fundamentals,
private sector investment increases to about 17 percent of GDP, with non-oil private
investment increasing to 11 percent of GDP in 2009.
42.
The non-oil external current account deficit is projected to narrow over the
medium term due to fiscal consolidation. More broadly, competitiveness will benefit from
NEEDS’ structural reforms. As assumed in NEEDS, annual external debt service payments
over the medium term are expected to continue at around their current level, implying
continued arrears accumulation.
43.
To illustrate the importance of policy choices, resource constraints and
vulnerability to shocks, staff discussed two scenarios as alternatives to the baseline:

•

The high-growth scenario reflects the authorities’ medium-term macroeconomic
framework underlying NEEDS, and aims at achieving an annual average of 7 percent
growth over the medium term—deemed necessary to meet the MDGs. To this end,
private investment would have to increase to about 20 percent of GDP. This, in turn,
would require US$4½ billion per year of additional foreign savings.

- 27 44.
The muddle-through scenario and debt sustainability analyses demonstrate that
Nigeria remains highly vulnerable to policy implementation risks and oil-related
shocks.22 This reflects a continued high public debt burden and dependence on oil, as well as
high volatility in macroeconomic variables. Stress tests on the baseline scenario show that a
two-standard deviation shock to revenues in 2005–06 would increase the public debt ratio to
115 percent of GDP by end-2009, compared with 43 percent in the baseline scenario. In
contrast, a two-standard deviation shock to real interest rates and real economic growth
in 2004 would increase the debt ratio to 65½ and 95¾ percent of GDP, respectively, by end2009. These sensitivities highlight the urgency of putting the economy on a stable policy
footing by strengthening fiscal management and rebuilding precautionary reserves, as well as
the need to address the external debt burden.23
F. Budgetary Reform Priorities
45.
The main structural fiscal challenge facing the government over the next few
years will be to further strengthen the budget process. 24 As part of NEEDS, the
authorities acknowledged the importance of further consolidating reforms in the area of
budget formulation, execution and reporting. Staff encouraged the authorities to formulate a
medium-term expenditure framework (MTEF) supported by an oil price-based fiscal rule.
The authorities requested technical assistance in the preparation of the 2005 budget and in
developing a MTEF. They also indicated that another priority will be verifying the stock of
domestic expenditure arrears, and developing a strategy for their clearance by 2007.
46.
Subnational fiscal reforms will be crucial to macroeconomic stability, longer
term growth and poverty reduction, particularly given the constitutional responsibility of
states to deliver essential social services. The authorities indicated that passage of the Fiscal
Responsibility Bill, including the implementation of the fiscal policy rule, introduction of
individual savings accounts for all states with the CBN and improved policy coordination,
would help reduce the procyclicality of fiscal policy in Nigeria. They further indicated that
they would encourage subnational governments to pursue similar public expenditure
reforms.25 In particular, the adoption of standardized economic and functional classification
22

See Appendix III for detailed description of the debt sustainability analysis.

23

The external debt service due is equivalent to 108 percent of the federal
government’s 2004 capital budget.

24

The fiscal strategy brief prepared with the assistance of FAD was used to guide the
discussions regarding fiscal structural reforms, in particular those related to public
expenditure management. See Appendix IV and accompanying selected issues paper for
detailed description.
25

The World Bank has taken the lead in assisting subnational governments strengthen their
public expenditure management systems. Work has focused on expenditure reviews, state
finances, governance and overall capacity building. Other elements include collaboration
with the Debt Management Office on management of states’ external and domestic debt.

- 28 systems would help them identify whether expenditure programs are properly targeted to
meet the governments’ development objectives. Some SLGs have agreed to receive technical
assistance in developing SEEDS.
G. Civil Service Reforms
47.
Civil service reforms are critical to creating a professional administration
commensurate with a smaller and more service-oriented government. The civil service
has grown rapidly over the last two decades, and accounts for the dominant share of
government spending. Several steps need to be taken, including an audit and pay verification
exercise, pay policy review, implementation of payroll controls, downsizing and right-fitting
in order to address the skills mismatch.
48.
The civil service reforms are being developed with the support of the World
Bank and other donors, and will be implemented in two phases. In the first phase, five
key ministries and agencies—the Federal Capital Territory, National Planning Commission,
Ministry of Finance, State House/Office of the President, and the Ministry of Information—
will be required to computerize their payroll, conduct a verification exercise to weed out
ghost workers and develop a skills analysis and restructuring plan. The next stage will
involve devising financial incentive packages to encourage or enable staff to leave, as well as
for training programs. The authorities’ plan is to expand the civil service reforms to the
remaining ministries and agencies starting mid-2005. Nevertheless, they acknowledge this
will be a difficult reform that will likely involve high budgetary costs for retrenchment,
retraining and new hiring.
H. Federal Domestic Debt Management
49.
Federal debt management has not been efficient. The debt burden is high, and the
lack of a comprehensive debt strategy has led to an accumulation of external and domestic
arrears, undermining Nigeria’s international credit standing. The government is also exposed
to high rollover and interest rate risks on its domestic debt, with over 60 percent concentrated
in three-month instruments.
50.
Staff and the authorities agreed that an immediate priority should be to lengthen
the maturity profile of domestic debt, and ensure a more even distribution to address
the bunching problem.26 These objectives could be achieved by developing a treasury bill
program in six-month and one-year maturities along with the current three-month program.
Staff, however, pointed out that in the absence of credible fiscal and monetary policies,
investments in longer-dated instruments would likely come at a much higher cost, and that it
may be better to develop the short-end of the market. As macroeconomic stability takes root,
the government’s borrowing cost would decline, permitting the sustainable development of
the government bond market. Staff further indicated that the projected cash surpluses over
26

An MFD technical assistance mission on domestic public debt management visited Abuja
in mid-February 2004.

- 29 the medium term would provide the opportunity to restructure the debt portfolio and also
lower the overall public debt burden. Overall, the domestic debt management reforms would
strengthen liquidity management—through the formal separation of monetary and debt
management operations—exert market pressure for fiscal discipline, improve oversight over
public debt management, and spur capital market development.
I. Governance and Transparency Reforms
51.
The authorities expressed a strong commitment to improved transparency and
accountability in the public sector. This is critical as the quality of Nigeria’s public
institutions continue to rank unfavorably internationally, and their inefficiency remains a
major deterrent to investment and growth. In the upcoming 2004 Africa Competitiveness
Report, Nigeria’s public institutions—measured by degree of corruption and the rules of
contract and law—rank next to last of the 21 African countries assessed, and third to last out
of the 80 countries assessed globally. Similarly, the 2002 Transparency International Report
places Nigeria next to last on its Corruption Perception Index.
52.
Staff noted recent progress in initiating governance reforms in the public sector.
Nigeria’s participation in the EITI and the intended oil sector audits would go a long way to
improve accountability and transparency. The authorities plan to publish all relevant data on
oil revenue and its uses. The procurement commission, to be in place before the end of 2004,
should strengthen government expenditure management and help achieve considerable
savings by bringing procurement practices in line with international practices. Publishing
monthly oil revenue allocations to all three tiers of government as well as quarterly federal
government budget reports, and the audited accounts of the federal government should help
raise public awareness of the uses of oil and non-oil revenue. The authorities have requested
technical assistance from both the Bank and the Fund on reconciling and improving the
transparency of oil revenue and payment flows. The development of the performance
indicators and reporting requirement for major line ministries should also help enhance
accountability in public spending. In this regard, staff encouraged a review of auditing and
accounting standards, to ensure their consistency with international best practice, as this
would help build trust in the veracity of audited financial statements.27 Strengthening the
Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) and expanding its investigation of
economic crimes committed by civil servants would send a strong signal that rent-seeking
behavior will not be tolerated in public institutions.

27

During the 2001 on-site safeguard assessment of the CBN, notable shortcomings were
reported in the conduct of audit and accounting practices, both falling short of International
Auditing Standards (IAS) and Nigerian Statement of Accounting Standards (SAS). The staff
stressed that these shortcomings—such as the retention of one audit firm for over 25 years,
no oversight of the external audit process, and non-compliance with SAS—need to be
addressed.

- 30 J. Privatization and Deregulation
53.
As part of the drive to streamline the role of government in the economy, the
privatization program and deregulation efforts will need to be accelerated. This would
support the government’s commitment to abandon past import-substitution strategies that
have led to a highly protected economy and the establishment of large, in many cases
nonviable, state-owned enterprises operating in all sectors of the economy. Well over
100 companies are still state-owned, and most are due for privatization over the next few
years.
54.
The authorities have indicated that a top priority for 2004 will be the
rehabilitation and privatization of NNPC’s oil refineries. The authorities also noted that
steps are being taken to privatize the heavily indebted national power company (NEPA). The
government has already outsourced collection to a private company to improve payment
discipline and NEPA’s overall effectiveness. The next step involves transferring NEPA’s
debt of N 340 billion to the Debt Management Office (DMO), unbundling NEPA into power
generation, transmission and distribution, and setting up a regulatory commission for the
electricity market.
55.
More generally, staff stressed that the government will need to intensify its
privatization and deregulatory efforts, including putting in place the necessary
regulatory and legal frameworks to ensure a level playing field, so that the public can
begin benefiting from the fruits of privatization. Privatization also needs to be carried out
in a more transparent and fair manner—key to engendering investor confidence. The general
impression remains that vested interests and political influences continue to interfere with the
process. As a general principle, staff emphasized that it would be important to minimize the
use of government funds for rehabilitating inefficient parastatals. The government’s preferred
option is outright asset sales or the sale of a 51 percent stake to a strategic partner, followed
by an initial public offering. In some cases, concession arrangements are being considered, in
particular with regard to rails, airports, and ports.
56.
Trade reforms will be essential to enhancing Nigeria’s growth prospects. While
broadly agreeing with the proposed tariff reforms, staff noted several aspects that will
determine the impact on the overall level of protection have yet to be finalized. A reduction
in the weighted average tariff is likely, but will depend on the timing of the phased
introduction of the new tariff bands and the allocation of traded goods among the tariff
bands. The number and permanence of import bans, and the period over which any special
taxes or levies would be phased out remain unclear. Staff noted that these import bans may
be inconsistent with WTO rules and urged the government to refrain from using import bans
as an instrument of protection as this would result in costly inefficiencies, including
smuggling. Staff suggested a review of the costs and benefits of such nontariff barriers.
K. Strengthening the Financial Sector
57.
While developing a sound financial system is a critical component of NEEDS, the
depth of measures included could be enhanced. The level of financial intermediation in
Nigeria’s banking system is low as reflected in a narrow M2/GDP ratio and a large share of

- 31 cash transactions. Banks continue to be plagued by weak governance such as misreporting
and systemic underprovisioning. High non-performing loans and operational inefficiencies,
among others, have contributed to the large spread between deposit and lending rates. In
addition, inefficiencies in the court system (delays and backlogs), difficulties in foreclosing
and collecting nonperforming loans, as well as obtaining occupancy or land titles, are other
factors contributing to the large spreads. Furthermore, many community banks and
development finance institutions are facing balance sheet difficulties and have generally been
ineffective in extending financial services to the rural economy.
58.
Against this backdrop, staff welcomed progress made in strengthening the
banking system and urged the authorities to pass the amended Bank and Other
Financial Institutions Act (BOFI), and enforce existing prudential standards. A zerotolerance policy should be adopted for misreporting and violating existing rules, as this
would help strengthen the banking sector. The authorities’ increased focus on the community
banks is important given their role in the rural economy. Staff further stressed that it would
be critical to address the structural impediments to credit creation and investment, such as the
lack of credit history for small businesses, absence of land or occupancy titles; and court
operating inefficiencies. The authorities agreed and are considering reforms to the justice
system as well as land reforms. They noted that liquidation of nonviable banks through the
courts has proven to be very difficult. In the meantime, options are being considered to
introduce commercial courts as a means to address some of these inefficiencies. The
authorities expressed a strong interest in a follow-up FSAP mission to identify areas needing
further strengthening.
59.
Staff suggested that reforms of monetary management and the financial sector
and capital market development, be incorporated more fully into NEEDS. This would
allow for strengthened reform efforts in other key government agencies such as the CBN,
Nigerian Deposit Insurance Corporation (NDIC), and the Securities Exchange Commission.
L. Capacity Building and Reform of the Statistical System
60.
The overall effectiveness of technical assistance has improved as a result of
enhanced ownership and better policy coordination; nonetheless, further strengthening
is warranted. In a number of areas, follow-up technical assistance missions have been
provided—such as in fiscal and domestic debt management and government finance
statistics. These missions have proven to be very effective as they deepen the institutional
reform process. Their success is also a reflection of the weakening of the initial resistance to
change. Given limited capacity in public institutions, staff urged the government to continue
to make full use of technical assistance, and to prioritize their needs and follow up on the
recommendations.
61.
There is broad agreement that the statistical system needs to be overhauled to
develop accurate and timely data for monitoring economic performance and for
formulating effective policy. The poor quality of national accounts, government finance and
customs data, unreliable and considerable publication lags and lack of an electronic database,
as well as timely data sharing among responsible government agencies undermine the ability
to monitor economic developments and ensure consistency of reform implementation.

- 32 Shortcomings in data sharing between the tiers of government, with the SLGs not publishing
budgetary information, also hamper economic and social analysis.
62.
At the urging of staff, the authorities are establishing a central technical unit
responsible for collating data from data-generating agencies and ensure consistency
thereof. The government has increased the budgetary allocation for the Federal Office of
Statistics (FOS). In addition, in cooperation with the donor community, including assistance
through Nigeria’s participation in the Fund’s General Data Dissemination Standards (GDDS)
project for selective countries in Africa, the government has developed a strategic plan to
address the legal and institutional framework governing the statistical system. This would
include amendments to the 1957 Statistical Act to strengthen the independence of the FOS.
Staff recommended that efforts be made to implement the main recommendations of recent
STA missions, including in the areas of national accounts and government finance statistics.
With regard to the latter, staff noted that the Planning, Research and Statistics Department in
the Ministry of Finance should assume its responsibility for compiling fiscal data.
IV. STAFF APPRAISAL
63.
Prospects for far-reaching economic and structural reforms have improved
significantly since the 2002 Article IV consultation. The new economic team has moved
quickly to develop and articulate a strategic vision for addressing Nigeria’s deep-rooted
macroeconomic and structural problems and reducing poverty. The development of NEEDS
signals a clear break from past shortcomings in economic policy formulation. Staff agrees
with the overall direction and thrust of the government’s vision and priority areas for tackling
economic development and unleashing the growth potential of the non-oil economy. In
addition, the early reform efforts are broadly consistent with the recommendations of
the 2002 Article IV consultations, and should help lay the foundation for more effective
economic policy formulation and implementation.
64.
The decisive actions already taken in several key areas should have an
immediate impact on macroeconomic management, economic efficiency, and
transparency and accountability. The elimination of the subsidy on petroleum products
was a particularly difficult and bold measure. Efforts to improve coordination among
ministries and government agencies should also contribute to more effective policy
implementation. Developments in the first four months of 2004 also signal a break from past
expansionary policies.
65.
Staff endorses Nigeria’s initiatives for fighting corruption and promoting good
governance. Staff strongly supports Nigeria’s participation in the EITI and commends the
authorities for successfully launching the initiative. The envisaged sector-wide audits and the
objective of publishing key oil revenue data and their utilization should significantly
strengthen transparency and accountability. Overall governance is also being enhanced by
establishing EFCC and pursuing high visibility cases. The procurement commission, to be in
place before end-2004, should also help strengthen government expenditure management,
and the publication of monthly revenue allocations to all SLGs should play an important role
in improving overall accountability.

- 33 66.
The risks and challenges facing the government are formidable. Consistent policy
implementation will be essential to successful reform. As borne out by earlier reform efforts,
weak institutions, limited technical capacity, and resistance from entrenched interests will be
especially challenging. Staff recognizes the importance of ”quick wins” to build reform
momentum, but feels that this should be done selectively with careful prioritization and
sequencing of reforms, to avoid overstretching administrative capacity. In particular,
emphasis on public service reforms and accountability and transparency will help establish
key building blocks to strengthen institutions and facilitate the effective implementation of
reforms that are resistant to reversal.
67.
The main challenge in 2004 will be to implement prudent macroeconomic
policies to reverse the effects of expansionary policies in 2003. This will require the
continuation and reinforcement of recent fiscal tightening at the federal level, accompanied
by appropriately tight monetary policy and convincing all states to save the oil windfall.
More broadly, macroeconomic policies should be geared toward minimizing vulnerability to
oil price shocks. The primary risk to effective macroeconomic management continues to be
the procyclical stance of fiscal policies at the subnational level.
68.
The 2004 federal budget represents a major departure from past practices. The
adoption of an oil price-based fiscal policy framework should help achieve sizable cash
savings to buffer against any future oil price shock and help contain a source of
macroeconomic volatility. Actions to strengthen the budget process including the fiscal
strategy paper and prioritization of the capital budget, as well as a dialogue with the
legislature on the role of the budget are particularly welcome.
69.
However, the federal government faces a major challenge in getting states’
agreement to save the oil windfall. If not all states agree to save the oil windfall, the
consolidated fiscal stance will remain expansionary. Achieving macroeconomic stability will
therefore depend critically on the success of the federal government’s negotiations with the
states on their participation in the oil price rule. Passage of the Fiscal Responsibility Bill
would provide the legal underpinning for prudent consolidated fiscal policy at all levels of
government.
70.
While the passage of a prudent federal budget is praiseworthy, the more
important test will be its execution. In this regard, staff welcomes the setting up of the
CMC to improve budgetary cash management and ensure that expenditure releases are made
in accordance with cash flow projections. The highly restrained fiscal stance of early 2004,
which enabled the government to sterilize excess oil revenue and significantly increase
international reserves, is particularly encouraging. Staff calls on the government to build on
the progress made on the 2004 budget process and begin the 2005 budget cycle early,
strengthen the prioritization of capital projects, design a strategy to address domestic arrears,
and develop an MTEF consistent with NEEDS.
71.
Staff encourages the CBN to implement a credible monetary policy framework
in order to achieve its primary objective of price stability. Given the monetary overhang
from 2003 and current inflationary pressures, the CBN will have to be vigilant in
implementing its monetary program in order to achieve its end-period inflation objectives.

- 34 The CBN should allow interest rates to adjust to ensure the conduct of monetary policy is
consistent with its reserve money-targeting framework and disinflation objectives. An
effective communication strategy to convey regularly the objectives and stance of monetary
policy will help to instill discipline and accountability in policy formulation and be
instrumental in establishing credibility.
72.
Staff welcomes the CBN’s move to daily open-market operations, as this will
enhance its ability to manage banking system liquidity. The CBN should enforce stricter
limits on the use of its discount window, particularly by weaker banks, in order to dissuade
use of the facility to manage liquidity needs. It should also reduce its reliance on direct
monetary controls and rely more on indirect market instruments to manage liquidity, as well
as allow for market-clearing interest rates in the primary government securities market. The
CBN, together with Nigeria Deposit Insurance Corporation, should continue to strengthen
governance practices in the banking system, adopt zero tolerance for misreporting and
violation of existing prudential regulations, and design a viable exit strategy for weak banks,
as enhanced financial deepening will be critical to improving the transmission channels of
monetary policy and achieving the authorities’ growth objectives.
73.
The exchange rate should be market-determined, and foreign exchange markets
should be unified. Staff and the authorities concur that moving toward an interbank system
for determining the exchange rate would require addressing critical institutional and
operational issues in the banking system. In this regard, the CBN’s request for technical
assistance to further develop and unify the foreign exchange market and examine liquidity
management practices is welcome. This would allow the authorities to work toward
accepting the obligations of Article VIII. In the interim, staff does not recommend Board
approval of the multiple currency practices.
74.
The implementation of the 2004 budget should enable the government to reduce
its net public debt, while the projected cash surpluses over the medium term should provide
an opportunity to restructure its debt portfolio, thus reducing the rollover risk. Regarding
external debt, the government’s improved cooperation with the Paris Club is welcome. It will
be important for the government to sustain improved relations with official creditors and
ensure comparability of treatment among creditors. In terms of effective debt management
and relations with creditors, staff urges the authorities to re-examine the trade-offs between
using projected cash surpluses to accumulate international reserves, reducing domestic debt
and raising external debt service payments. In this regard, the authorities should endeavor to
service their debt to the fullest extent possible.
75.
The medium-term challenges are significant and prospects will depend on the
effectiveness of implementing sound, pro-growth policies. Staff notes that the authorities’
growth targets as outlined in NEEDS, while necessary for meeting the MDGs, are ambitious
and would require a quick and strong supply response to the envisaged reforms and
substantial resource mobilization. Staff feels that a cautious growth assumption would be
prudent, pending a more careful examination of the specific policies that could elicit such a
response. In this context, it would be important to accelerate the structural reform agenda—
particularly with regard to privatization, unifying the foreign exchange market, and civil
service reforms. Moreover, given Nigeria’s vulnerabilities to oil related shocks, staff

- 35 underscores the need to strengthen fiscal management, rebuild international reserves, and
address the external debt burden.
76.
Staff welcomes the authorities' progress in reviewing the tariff structure, but
cautions against continued reliance on import bans. Trade polices should encourage
external competitiveness rather than create a bias toward import substitution. Policy efforts
should, therefore, focus on raising productivity by removing structural obstacles and
reducing costs of production.
77.
The inadequate statistical system represents a risk to successfully implementing
and monitoring NEEDS and policy formulation more generally. Staff calls on the
authorities to revamp the FOS as a matter of priority. Staff welcomes the government’s
agreement to the establishment of a technical committee that will have the authority to collect
and ensure consistency of data from various government agencies.
78.
The Fund remains committed to providing policy advice and helping build
capacity in Nigeria. Staff welcomes the authorities’ request to monitor, as part of intensified
surveillance efforts, the implementation of their program on a quarterly basis and looks
forward to carrying out a review of developments during the first six months of 2004,
following the completion of the Article IV consultations.
79.
The next Article IV consultation with Nigeria is expected to be held on the
standard 12-month cycle.

1/ State and local governments collect their own revenue (such as income tax and property tax).
2/ External debt service is on a commitment basis. Capital spending for 2002 excludes the cash overhang of N 160 billion accumulated in 2001
3/ This reflects the drawdown of unspent capital mandates to finance capital expenditure committed in previous years.
4/ Excluding oil revenue, cash call payments and interest payments.

VII. Exchange Rate Arrangement:
Nigeria’s current exchange rate arrangement is classified in the Fund’s Annual Report on
Exchange Arrangements and Exchange Restrictions as a managed float with no
preannounced target for the exchange rate of the naira. The inter-bank foreign exchange
market is segmented into two sub-markets. The Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) sells foreign
exchange to legitimate end-users through banks that bid , with requests having to be
supported by the required documentation. The open Nigerian inter-bank market (NIFEX) is
the market for foreign exchange obtained from other sources than the CBN, including nonoil exports and personal transfers, and the NIFEX rate is freely negotiable among
commercial banks as well as among customers. On February 20, 2001, the CBN issued a
circular which forbid banks from transferring funds obtained from the CBN to other banks
through the NIFEX, effectively segmenting the two markets. On July 22, 2002, the

- 50 -

APPENDIX I

authorities adopted the Dutch Auction System (DAS) for selling official foreign exchange
to end-users. The DAS is a sealed bid multiple price auction system with the marginal rate
being the rate that clears the market. Auctions take place twice a week and the CBN
announces the amount on offer the day before the auction and the auction results the day
after. Funds purchased from the CBN shall be used for eligible transactions only, subject to
stipulated documentation requirements. Such funds are not transferable in the inter-bank
foreign exchange market.
Currently, there are four exchange rates: the DAS auction rate, the NIFEX rate quoted by a
group of commercial banks, the Bureaux de change rate, and the parallel market rate.
The following exchange rates were quoted on April 8, 2004:
IFEM/DAS
N = US$133.
NIFEX
N = US$138.4.
Bureaux de change/parallel market N = US$136.
The exchange rate for the SDR on April 7, 2004 was N176.6 = SDR 1.
VIII. Article IV Consultation
Nigeria is on the standard 12-month Article IV consultation cycle. The last Article IV
consultation discussions were held in Lagos and Abuja during the period June 15–25 and
October 9–18, 2002. The staff report (November 25, 2002) was discussed by the Executive
Board and the consultation concluded on December 18, 2002.

APPENDIX II

Nigeria: Relations with the World Bank Group
World Bank Strategy of Assistance to Nigeria
1.
A second progress report on the World Bank Group’s Joint Interim Strategy of
Assistance to Nigeria (JISU) is expected to be presented to the World Bank Board for
discussion in May 2004. Given recent progress on economic policy and performance, one of
the intended objectives of the Board discussion is to secure endorsement of an expanded
World Bank engagement in Nigeria and in particular, a move from the current low case
lending envelope of $200 million annually to the base case of $400 million annually.28 The
three main pillars of the JISU are: (i) strengthening economic governance; (ii) promoting
private sector-led growth; and (iii) expanding delivery of basic social services to the poor
through the empowerment of local communities. A full Country Assistance Strategy, based
on Nigeria’s PRSP (now being elaborated in the form of the National Economic
Empowerment and Development Strategy-NEEDS), is expected to be prepared in close
collaboration with the Nigerian government and other stakeholders in FY05.
2.
Bank assistance in FY04 has focused on responding quickly to the Federal
Government’s new reform momentum through both formal and informal technical assistance
and advice in a broad range of areas. The Bank Group has also been strengthening the
pipeline of lending operations—including on civil service reform—in anticipation of an
expanded program.
World Bank-IMF relations
3.
The IMF and World Bank staffs maintain a close collaborative relationship on
Nigeria. Both institutions are coordinating their policy advice to the government in several
different areas through collaboration on analytical work, and through joint technical
assistance missions. The Bank staff is regularly invited to, and does, join IMF
macroeconomic missions, and both are members of a multi-donor thematic group on
economic governance that seeks to coordinate donor advice and work in this area.
4.
In September 2003, at the request of the Nigerian government, the Bank and the IMF
carried out a joint technical assistance mission for the Budget Office. A similar joint mission
to advice government on the proposed Pension Reform Bill was carried out in
November 2003. Support to the preparation of the NEEDS is also another area of close
collaboration between the two institutions.

28

An informal briefing of the Board on progress in implementation of the JISU in June 2002,
led to a scaling back of the Bank’s lending envelope from the base case of $400 million to a
low case of $200 million.

- 53 -

APPENDIX II

5.
Under the erstwhile Stand-By Arrangement, the IMF took the lead in the area of
macroeconomic stability with the dialogue on structural measures, coordinated with the
World Bank. In the absence of a successor IMF-supported program, a detailed matrix
stipulating areas where each institution will take the lead in supporting key structural
measures, including several areas of joint responsibility such as fiscal transparency, fiscal
federalism, budget procedures and institutions, and public debt management, has not been
agreed. This could be explored in the context of the preparation and implementation of the
NEEDS.
Lending activities
6.
The World Bank’s Nigeria portfolio consists of fifteen credits, totaling about
$1.1 billion. Operations cover activities in Health (22 percent ), Education (14 percent),
Private Sector Development (13 percent), Urban Development (10 percent), Rural Sector
(9 percent); Transport (9 percent) Energy & Mining (9 percent) Social Development/Social
Protection (11.8 percent), Economic Policy (1.8 percent), and Water Supply & Sanitation
(0.4 percent).
7.
Two credits in the portfolio (the Economic Management and Capacity Building
Project and the Privatization Support Project) are focused on economic management and on
support for the government’s privatization effort. An operation to support a first phase of the
Federal Government’s Civil Service Reform Program is expected to be ready for Board
approval—subject to Board agreement to a larger lending envelope for FY04—in June 2004.
A States Governance and Capacity Building Project would focus on building economic
management capacity and on civil service reform at the state level, is expected to be ready
for approval in early FY05.
8.
The Economic Management and Capacity Building Project (US$20 million in
IDA financing, and cofinancing of US$19.6 million from the U.S. Agency for International
Development, the U.K. Department for International Development, the European Union, and
Japan) was approved on May 11, 2000. It supports the strengthening of key aspects of
economic management, including economic and poverty statistics, public expenditure
management, public procurement, and external audit and oversight of federal government
fiscal operations—including by the legislature—and legal and judicial reform. Under this
project, value-for-money audits of selected items of federal government spending (both
recurrent and capital) and a corruption survey have been carried out. Other key activities that
are being supported include the revision of the 1958 Finance (Management and Control) Act,
implementation of procurement reforms, installation of an integrated Financial and Economic
Management Information System, and construction of a global distance-learning center.
9.
For the Privatization Support Operation, the World Bank Board approved the
$114.29 million equivalent of IDA credit on June 14, 2001. The aim of this project is to
strengthen the overall institutional and policy framework for public enterprise divestiture and
improve the institutional capacity of the Bureau of Public Enterprises, the agency responsible

- 54 -

APPENDIX II

for privatization. The project also provides financing for advisory services for privatization
of the power sector (the Nigerian Electric Power Authority) and the telecommunications
sector (divestiture of the national telecommunications companies, NITEL and M-Tel). In
addition, the project supports the divestiture of Lagos State Water through concessioning (an
IFC mandate) and rehabilitation of the water supply system in Lagos. A mid-term review of
the project that took place from March 26-April 6, 2004 agreed on details of reallocation of
resources and monitoring of results, which will enable a more focused and efficient project
implementation.
Nonlending activities
10.
The World Bank has placed increased emphasis on its non-lending activities. Work in
this area has focused on public expenditure management—through public expenditure
reviews at both federal and state levels, a report on state finances, and a report on the states’
governance and capacity. Other elements of this work include collaboration with the Debt
Management Office on Management of Sub-national Debt; a report on managing volatility; a
pilot survey of service delivery in basic health in Lagos and Kogi States; a private sector
assessment; a rural sector strategy; and a report on the linkages between environment and
poverty. Bank staff worked closely with various policy groups, within and outside
government on outlining key reform and development priorities and actions. An Education
Sector Status Report was completed in FY03 and is Risk and Vulnerability Assessment is to
be completed in FY04. Work is ongoing on a study on Oil Revenues Management including
a workshop in February 2004—in collaboration with the IMF—to bring together various
Nigerian stakeholders as well as external experts on this issue. A study on the micro
foundations of competitiveness in specific industries is also in process.
IFC activities
11.
As of October 2003, Nigeria’s portfolio was about US$171 million with activities in:
finance and insurance (62 percent); oil, gas and mining (26 percent); private equity funds
(6 percent); and other activities (6 percent). IFC continues to encourage and support Small
and Medium Enterprises, and invests in private sector development, including the banking
industry and infrastructure.
12.
IFC also seeks to promote projects that will assist Nigeria in diversifying its economy
from the oil sector and removing bottlenecks faced by the non-oil private sector. Recent
activities include for:
13.
Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs): IFC provides a broad range of financing and
technical support to small businesses in Nigeria. Jointly with UNIDO, support was provided
to NGOs (the FATE Foundation and the Onitsha/Nnewi/Aba Cluster program) through the
Support Training Entrepreneurship Program (STEP), which provides business development
services to micro enterprises. Other initiatives include a financing and capacity-building
facility for small-scale oil service companies in the Niger Delta region. A comprehensive
program with support from the World Bank is also being designed to provide additional

- 55 -

APPENDIX II

support for small business access to finance, business development services and for help in
improving the SME business environment.
14.
Telecommunications Sector: In FY02 IFC approved an investment of $100 million for
MTN Nigeria, a large mobile telecommunication company, for the expansion of its
nationwide GSM (Global System for Mobile Communications) cellular telecommunications
network in Nigeria, and by February 2006, the company expects to have well in excess of
15,000,000 subscribers in accordance with its license requirements. IFC is playing role of
fostering competition, supporting private sector development, and improve the
telecommunications market and services.
15.
Financial Sector: Since scaling up of IFC operations began in 1999–2000, IFC has
worked with seven commercial banks, extending term facilities totaling over $160 million.
With no long-term funding options available in Nigeria, banks have used the IFC credits to
offer medium-term financing to a range of clients in expanding their businesses. IFC is
expanding this relationship with leading banks to support more small business financing
options, and also to build the nascent corporate bond market.
World Bank Institute activities (WBI)
16.
Nigeria is one of the WBI’s six focus countries in Africa. The number of Nigerian
participants in WBI programs has significantly increased in the last two years (from
280 participants in FY01, to 519 in FY02 and 1,430 in FY03). The sharp increase in the
number of participants in FY03 was due to the increased use of Distance Learning as a
delivery mode and the larger number of events held locally. The professional groups and
communities of practice that took the fullest advantage of WBI programs were public
expenditure managers, individuals involved in social protection/social risk management
programs, parliamentarians, and journalists. This concentration of efforts is in line with the
World Bank’s strategy to help Nigeria manage its public resources and help strengthen the
voice of the poor at the community level. However, irrespective of the well-targeted WBI
assistance, it is unlikely to make a lasting impact on capacity, if the Institute does not
adequately leverage its efforts with those of the Africa Region and other development
partners. For this reason, the Institute is taking steps to increase its involvement in the
context of the WBI Country Program Brief endorsed by the Nigeria Country Team.
Thematically, in coming years, the WBI program will be more focused on developing the
capacity of members of the civil society working to make their voices heard and forge a
national consensus. For this reason, the Institute is carrying out a major effort to identify
capacity building needs at the community level through the Capacity Enhancement Needs
Assessment (CENA) methodology. The pursuit of the World Bank’s strategic objectives has
also led to a better integration of WBI staff into the Nigeria Country Team and IDA project
teams.

APPENDIX III

Nigeria: External and Public Debt Sustainability Analysis
17.
This note assesses the sensitivity of Nigeria’s external and public debt dynamics
under the staff’s baseline scenario to a number of standardized shocks in the debt
sustainability framework recently developed in the Fund. It also examines the implications
for external debt sustainability of an alternative oil price scenario.
18.
While the current favorable oil price assumptions ameliorate the severity of Nigeria’s
debt situation, a decline in the oil price by just one standard deviation over the medium term
would likely undermine Nigeria’s ability to reduce its external debt burden.
A. The Structure of Nigeria’s Public Debt
19.
At end-2003, Nigeria’s gross public debt1 amounted to N 5.6 trillion (about
77 percent of GDP), compared with N 4.9 trillion (88 percent of GDP) at end-2002. The
stock of domestic debt continued to rise as the federal government resorted to a mixture of
market-based and monetary means to finance part of its gross borrowing needs. The bulk of
the end-2003 debt stock—US$32.8 billion or 56.9 percent of GDP—is owed to external
creditors.2 Bilateral debt, of which almost all is owed to Paris Club creditors, accounts for
83½ percent of total external debt, while the share owed to multilateral and commercial
creditors was relatively smaller (9¼ and 7¼ percent, respectively).
B. The Baseline Scenario
20.
The baseline scenario underlying these debt sustainability analyses projects growth to
average 5 percent over the medium term, with the non-oil sector expected to reach its growth
potential of 5-5½ percent. Inflation is projected to fall gradually to 5 percent by end-2009. As
described in the accompanying staff report, staff’s baseline scenario is predicated on the
implementation of prudent macroeconomic policies and structural reforms as envisaged
under the government’s National Economic Empowerment and Development Strategy
(NEEDS), but is more cautious on the supply response and prospects for resource
mobilization.

1

The public debt figures includes external debt by the public sector and federal government
debt. It excludes domestic debt by subnationals and domestic expenditure arrears by the
federal government—both of which are believed to be considerable.
2

The total external debt stock figure includes external arrears of around US$3.5 billion at
end-2003. While higher external debt service payments of US$1.8 billion in 2003 (compared
to US$1 billion in 2002), allowed Nigeria to fully service its commercial and multilateral
debt, new arrears of US$1.2 billion accumulated to Paris Club creditors in 2003. The external
debt stock does not include any external borrowing by the private sector in Nigeria.

APPENDIX III

•

With the current favorable outlook for oil prices, implementation of an oil price-based
fiscal rule by all tiers of government—resulting in gradual convergence of the
consolidated fiscal stance to balance by 2008–09 at the oil price of US$20 per barrel
and oil revenue in excess of the benchmark price saved—will generate large overall
surpluses over the medium term. The baseline scenario includes clearance of pension
arrears, assumed to amount to N 100 billion, which will be repaid over a five-year
period.

•

The prudent fiscal stance will be complemented by monetary and exchange rate
policies geared to the government’s objective of price stability (reaching single digit
inflation in 2005) and rebuilding international reserves.

•

The non-oil current account deficit is projected to narrow over the medium term in
line with the stronger fiscal position and higher agricultural production. However, the
current account deficit will rise steadily to nearly 5 percent of GDP in 2009 with the
worsening in the terms of trade. Reflecting market-friendly reforms and stronger
fundamentals, non-debt creating capital inflows should average around 6 percent of
GDP through 2009 (compared to a ten-year average of 3¾ percent of GDP). The
favorable overall balance of payments outlook will allow for a significant buildup in
international reserves to around nine months of imports (GNFS) as a buffer against
potential oil price shocks, and consistent with expected savings of excess oil
proceeds.

21.
The baseline scenario implies a gradual reduction in both total public and external
debt. By end-2009, the stock of total public and external debt will decline to about 45 and
39 percent of GDP, respectively. The projected fiscal cash surpluses are expected to help
lower net debt through the build up of precautionary balances and repayment of domestic
debt. However, as foreshadowed in NEEDS, annual cash debt service payments are expected
to continue at around their current level. The implied accumulation of external arrears and
penalty interest on those arrears slows the pace at which the external debt ratio is reduced.
External debt service falling due is expected to average around 10 percent of revenue (or
40 percent of non-oil revenue) and 9-10 percent of export earnings (or 115 percent of non-oil
exports) over the medium term.
22.
Under a scenario in which external debt service is paid in full, at the expense of some
build up of international reserves, the external debt to GDP ratio would fall to 32 percent
by 2009. Other things equal, gross international reserves would reach around US$16.3 billion
or 6½ months of imports (GNFS) compared to US$22 billion or nearly 9 months of imports
(GNFS) under the baseline.
C. Fiscal Sustainability
23.
Stress tests show that Nigeria’s public finances remain highly vulnerable to shocks in
oil prices, as well as shocks to real GDP and real interest rate, but also implementation risks
(no policy change scenario). This reflects a number of factors: for one, Nigeria’s public

- 62 -

APPENDIX III

finances are vulnerable to developments in the oil sector, such as sharp changes in oil prices
and disruptions in oil production. The overall tax base is volatile on account of the large
share oil revenue and narrow non-oil tax base. Furthermore, the debt burden—at 77 percent
of GDP at end-2003—is already considered unsustainably high, and hence vulnerable to
shocks in debt-servicing costs and real economic growth. Moreover, the large share of shortterm domestic debt exposes the government to high rollover and interest rate risk. A shock to
the historical interest rate average is somewhat misleading, as reliance on nonmarket sources
of financing in the past have lowered the implied cost of borrowing, and helped insulate
government’s finances from market forces. Offsetting somewhat these risks, the high foreign
currency composition of government revenue provides a natural hedge against unexpected
exchange depreciation—as visible in the low impact of the exchange rate shock. The
highlights of the results are as follows:
•

Reflecting the government’s narrow revenue base and high dependence on oil
revenue, a two-standard deviation shock to revenue in 2005–06 would increase the
debt/GDP ratio to 114 percent by end-2009, twice as high as in the baseline scenario.

•

A two-standard deviation shock to real interest rate and real economic growth in 2004
would increase the debt/GDP ratio to 65½ percent at end-2009, and 95¾ percent,
respectively.

•

The ‘no-change policy scenario’ also indicates that public finances remain vulnerable
to a continuation of past policies with public debt ratio increasing to 117½ percent by
end-2009.
D. External Sustainability

24.
Stress tests suggest that, with policies along the lines described above and favorable
oil prices, Nigeria’s ratio of external debt to GDP would remain on a downward trend over
the medium term, irrespective of the nature of the shock. However, the level of debt could be
much higher in the short run and, under three stress tests, would remain above the 2004 ratio
to GDP at the end of the projection period (Table 1a and Figure 1). The highlights of the
results are as follows:
•

The U.S. dollar deflator shock (stress test 3) has the most severe short-term impact,
with the external debt ratio peaking at 113½ percent of GDP in 2006, declining
rapidly thereafter to 49 percent of GDP by 2009 (10 percentage points above the
baseline).

•

Real GDP growth rate and noninterest current account shocks (stress test 2 and 4)
would lead to a similar, but less marked, hump-shaped pattern in the debt ratio. Under
stress test 2, external debt would reach 45 percent of GDP in 2009. However, the
decline would be less pronounced under stress test 4, with the debt ratio peaking at
64 percent of GDP in 2006 and then declining to 57 percent of GDP by 2009.

APPENDIX III

- 63 -

•

A combined shock to GDP growth, the U.S. dollar deflator and noninterest current
account (stress test 5) would, not surprisingly, have the most significant and lasting
impact on the external debt path. The external debt level would rise steeply, peaking
at 99½ percent of GDP in 2006 (somewhat below the peak of the U.S. dollar deflator
only shock), but then would fall only to 87 percent in 2009 (more than double the
debt ratio projected under the baseline and around 30 percentage points higher than
the end-2003 debt ratio).

•

An interest rate shock (stress test 1) would have only a marginal impact on the
external debt path, declining gradually to 41½ percent of GDP at end-2009.

•

Finally, under the scenario with average historical values of key variables (alternative
scenario 1), the debt ratio would decline much faster than under the baseline scenario.
This reflects a number of factors, including; the expected pickup in investment and
other non-debt-creating flows in the baseline relative to the ten-year average; the
stronger average current account position over the preceding ten years,
notwithstanding the large volatility; and an expected resumption of relations with
creditors under the baseline (for example, expected borrowing from the World Bank).

E. Country-Specific Alternative Scenario
25.
The country-specific alternative scenario assumes that, from 2005 onwards, the oil
price would be one standard deviation ($5.37/bbl for 1994-2003) below the currently
projected path. Under the alternative scenario, Nigeria’s gross external financing need would

- 64 -

APPENDIX III

rise dramatically to 15 percent of GDP (or US$11 billion) in 2009, compared to 6¾ percent
of GDP (or US$5½ billion) under the baseline (Table 1b).
•

If it is assumed that the additional financing need would be met through both a
rundown of international reserves (to US$3.5 billion or less than 1½ months of
imports (GNFS) by 2009) and lower cash debt service payments, the debt ratio would
jump by about 4 percentage point relative to the 48¾ percent of GDP projected
for 2004, and would remain at or above 51½ percent of GDP throughout the
projection period (Table 1a and Figure 2).

•

If, however, the authorities were to make a policy decision to keep international
reserves around their end-2004 level and the financing need were to be met through
additional borrowing, the downward trend in the external debt ratio under the baseline
would be reversed. Relative to 2004, the external debt ratio would increase by more
than 13 percentage points, reaching more than 62 percent of GDP by 2009. That said.
Nigeria’s lack of access to capital markets will likely constrain the extent to which
additional debt is incurred.

Nigeria: Short– and Medium–Term Structural Fiscal Reform Agenda
1.
Substantial improvements in the capacity for fiscal management will be central to the
Nigerian authorities’ pursuit of macroeconomic stability, sustainable growth and poverty
reduction. Nigeria’s history has been marked by a high level of macroeconomic volatility
brought about by boom-bust oil revenue cycles and inefficient public spending. The
authorities’ medium-term program aims at reducing the non-oil deficit to a more sustainable
level and limiting vulnerability to oil market volatility. The achievement of those goals will
partly depend on the implementation of structural fiscal reforms in a number of core areas:
budget formulation, budget execution, fiscal reporting, and operational aspects of fiscal
federalism.
Budget formulation
2.
In the short term, (i) the budget formulation process should start earlier; (ii) the
budget circular should include explicit line ministry expenditure limits endorsed by the
Federal Executive Council and comparable information on actual spending; (iii) the capital
budget should be streamlined and its formulation centralized at the Budget Office; and
(iv) the budget classification should be improved. In the medium term, (i) the government
should integrate the recurrent and capital budget processes and replace the dual budget
structure by a fully consolidated budget; (ii) the legal framework for the budget could be
strengthened by introducing a clearer determination of roles and responsibilities in the
approval process; and (iii) a medium-term expenditure framework should be introduced.
Budget execution
3.
There has been some progress in coordination between the Budget Office (BOF) and
the Office of the Accountant-General of the Federation (OAGF) through computerizing the
budget execution process. However, improving the government’s cash management will
require: (i) improved cash planning in the Cash Management Unit in the OAGF;
(ii) consolidating recent efforts to strengthen the record keeping and reconciliation of
warrants, mandates and cash releases; (iii) eliminating unused cash balances in line
ministry/agency bank accounts; and (iv) rationalizing banking arrangements, including the
introduction of a treasury single account.
Fiscal reporting
4.
Strengthened federal government fiscal reporting will require: (i) establishing a
system of regular and timely reporting of fiscal information to allow policymakers to make
informed decisions; (ii) publishing government accounts on a quarterly or monthly basis; and
(iii) extending these reporting requirements to parastatals. In the meantime, the BOF should
take a more proactive role in monitoring budget implementation, and the OAGF should
continue to strengthen the timeliness, coverage and accuracy of the expenditure data in the
monthly transcripts from line ministries and agencies, as well as the reconciliation of fiscal
data.

- 70 -

APPENDIX IV

Operational aspects of fiscal federalism

5.
In the short term, there is a need to strengthen information sharing between the BOF
and states on budget and revenue assumptions, and to establish a system of reporting
subnational budget approval and execution. Medium term priorities should be:
(i) strengthening fiscal policy coordination across the three tiers of government;
(ii) introducing an oversight of subnational borrowing; and (iii) implementing a fiscal rule for
all levels of government (including establishing individual state savings accounts with the
CBN).

- 71 -

APPENDIX V

Nigeria: Statistical Issues
1.
Nigeria’s statistical base continues to suffer from serious deficiencies that hamper
surveillance, policy design, and monitoring. These deficiencies are across the board, but
particularly affect the national accounts, government finance, money and banking, and the
external accounts, including major inconsistencies between balance of payments and customs
data on trade. Numerous problems prevent the compilation of timely and internally consistent
data, in particular inadequate funding for the Federal Office of Statistics, lack of data sharing
between data producing and collecting agencies, and insufficient use of computerization in
the compilation of statistics. In addition, the 1957 Statistical Act no longer addresses the
requirements of data collection and dissemination within a federal structure. The authorities
recognize these problems, and intend to address them as part of NEEDS.
National accounts
2.
Annual national accounts statistics are published by the Federal Office of Statistics
(FOS) with about a one-year lag. The national accounts statistics are of poor quality, largely
owing to a deterioration in business and household surveys. Estimates of value added for
agriculture, mining (oil), industry, transportation, and financial and other services are based
on old surveys with extrapolations that use out-of-date ratios and other indicators. The base
year 1984 no longer reflects the economic structure of the economy, with significant
structural shifts since. Many sectoral deflators are not soundly based and have a number of
inconsistencies. In the past, the use of the official exchange rate has resulted in a gross
understatement of value added in the oil and export sectors. The expenditure accounts suffer
from unreliable external trade and government budgetary data.
3.
A July 2003 mission to help the authorities implement the GDDS recommendations
in the area of National Accounts and provide guidance on institutional reforms in the
statistical system, found that progress has been made and that the authorities were receiving
significant technical assistance from DfID and others such as the World Bank. Together with
donor help the authorities have developed a master plan. .
Prices
4.
The official monthly consumer price index (CPI) is a composite of urban and rural
price data, and the consumption weights are based on the 1985–86 National Consumer
Survey. Some data on producer prices are collected, but these statistics are not
comprehensive and no producer price index is compiled. As a consequence, some sectoral
GDP deflator indices are based not on producer prices, but on consumer price subindices and
ad hoc assumptions. Expenditure deflators also suffer from methodological shortcomings.
Government finance
5.
Fiscal data in Nigeria have historically been opaque and complicated not only by the
federal structure, but also by a multiplicity of off-budget funds and by accounting practices
that underestimate the actual size of public expenditure. The multisector statistics mission

- 72 -

APPENDIX V

that visited Nigeria during September 6-21, 1999 noted that the most pressing shortcomings
related to inadequate data coverage, the lack of monthly and quarterly compilation, and
timeliness.
6.
A government finance statistics (GFS) mission in early 2001 found that authorities
had implemented few of the recommendations made by the multisector statistics mission that
visited Nigeria in 1999. Following the creation of a National Committee on Government
Finance Statistics (NCGFS), another GFS mission visited Abuja in March 2002 and found no
further progress had been made by the NCGFS, notably owing to insufficiently clear
institutional arrangements and lack of staff. The mission also identified inconsistencies and
difficulties of interpretation across the various source data. The mission conducted a
compilation exercise using data for 2000 that showed substantial room for progress in the
consistency of source data and reconciliation between above- and below-the-line data. This
exercise compiled data for the consolidated central government and general government,
with special effort to capture the numerous special funds and dedicated accounts that carry
out large financial transactions. It used the new Government Finance Statistics Manual 2001
(GFSM 2001) framework (but on a cash basis), which has the advantages of integrating
stocks and flows and facilitating the presentation of the consolidation of fiscal data.
7.
The mission also laid out a detailed 3-stage “action plan” and recommended for
immediate action to: expand the NCGFS and increase GFS unit staffing; improve the
consistency of OAGF and Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) source data; expand CBN work to
reconcile government financing data (available in-house); have the GFS unit document an
inventory of source data. The action plan suggested that a second step focus on improving the
reporting of state and local government operations, as well as ensuring adequate GFS
dissemination and that a third step focus on a more complete application of the GFSM 2001.
8.
A follow up mission in July 2003 found that the authorities had implemented very
few of the recommendations/work plan that were put forward by the 2002 mission, including
on the proposed strategy for transition to the GFSM 2001. The mission did not reach its full
potential, largely because of limited access to some of the relevant agencies. The authorities
had expected that more time would be devoted to general training. The mission was told that
the work plan proposed by the 2002 mission had been approved, but was unable to confirm
specific progress. The expert was unable to successfully review the issues on source data
raised by the 2002 mission. On the other hand, the mission reported progress in specific
areas, in particular in regard to the work of the CBN
Monetary accounts
9.
The authorities have taken steps toward implementing the key recommendations of
past STA money and banking technical assistance missions and the 1999 STA multisector
mission. However, a March 2001 follow-up mission found that problems remained, in
particular regarding the consistency of the interbank positions. Large and volatile
discrepancies in interbank positions, both among the commercial banks and between the
CBN and the commercial banks distort monetary aggregates and undermine the usefulness of

- 73 -

APPENDIX V

monetary statistics for policy analysis and decision making. Moreover, the lags in publishing
monetary data remain considerable.
Balance of payments
10.
Balance of payments statistics are compiled from the foreign exchange records in the
banking system and from data derived from surveys. However, oil sector data are weakened
by the low response rate to survey requests from oil businesses. In the non-oil sectors, only
enterprises with foreign capital participation are surveyed. The estimates of non-oil imports
of goods and services are based on banking data. Private capital movements are
underrecorded, and data on external debt service are inaccurate. Moreover, the trade data
reported by the FOS (based on customs data) sharply differ from those reported by the CBN
(based on banking data). Based on comparisons with counterparty data, the former are likely
to significantly under-report informal trade. The CBN, in collaboration with the March 2004
mission, undertook work to refine their import estimation methodology to minimize the
under-reporting of imports, although further work is needed in the area of oil- and gas-sector
imports. The 1999 STA multisector mission identified actions to be taken for improving the
quality of balance of payments data. However, a November 2000 follow-up mission found
that no progress had been made by the authorities in implementing the recommendations of
the 1999 STA mission. Except for some methodological changes, the compilation of balance
of payments continues to be severely affected by organizational weaknesses and resource
constraints in the FOS, customs and the CBN. The Nigeria authorities have not yet initiated
compiling international reserves data in line with the Data Template on International
Reserves and Foreign Currency Liquidity. Moreover, staff has been unable to assess whether
data on official reserve assets is in principle consistent with the template; the data may not be
adequate for monitoring because they may not adequately reflect foreign currency liabilities
or distinguish other foreign currency assets.
External debt
11.
To address problems with the data on external debt, a United Kingdom-financed
technical assistance effort was launched in October 1998. After initial delays, the Debt
Management Office was established in August 2000, and good progress has been made in
verifying individual loan accounts with creditors’ statements and improving the efficiency of
debt management in Nigeria. An audit of Nigeria’s loan portfolio for correctness and
duplication was carried out after the two separate databases of the Federal Ministry of
Finance and the CBN were merged. In September 2000, the process of reconciling Nigeria’s
external obligations to multilateral creditors began. Following the Paris Club agreement of
December 13, 2000, the verification of individual loan accounts with each individual Paris
club creditor was also launched and, by October 2001, was reported to be ready complete.
The full reconciliation of Nigeria’s external debt with creditors’ statements was not
completed as expected by early 2003, but is now nearing completion. The authorities do not
collect data on private sector external debt, but over time should work to extend the coverage
of their database to include private sector liabilities.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

International Monetary Fund
700 19th Street, NW
Washington, D. C. 20431 USA

IMF Concludes 2004 Article IV Consultation with Nigeria
On July 16, 2004, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded the
Article IV consultation with Nigeria.1
Background
Economic performance over the past 18 months has been mixed. Despite favorable
developments in the real economy, overall macroeconomic policies have been expansionary.
However, the government moved quickly to articulate the National Economic Empowerment and
Development Strategy (NEEDS), aimed at addressing Nigeria’s deep-rooted macroeconomic
and structural challenges. Moreover, macroeconomic developments for the first half of 2004
have been encouraging, with considerable oil savings achieved, signaling a reversal of the
expansionary policies of the past years.
Real GDP growth in Nigeria accelerated in 2003 on account of sharply higher oil and gas
production and continued robust growth in the non-oil economy. Due to favorable terms of trade
developments, the external current account deficit narrowed sharply. This, however, masks
rising non-oil import pressures and a widening non-oil external current account deficit.
Fiscal policy continued to be procyclical and expansionary in 2003, with the non-oil primary
balance deteriorating as a percent of non-oil GDP. Although the federal government achieved
some fiscal tightening, this was more than offset by higher spending of the oil windfall by state
1

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies.
On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the
Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the
Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the
country's authorities.

-2-

and local governments (SLGs). The overall deficit would have been higher had the federal
authorities not introduced several measures to enhance revenue collection and restrain
spending in the second half of 2003, particularly with regard to the capital budget and the
supplementary budget that was approved in early December 2003. Government oil revenue
also improved after the Nigeria National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) was required to pay the
market price for crude oil allocated for domestic refining.
Monetary policy was expansionary. Net credit to the government expanded rapidly in the first
three quarters of 2003. Lax monetary conditions led to a monetary overhang and negative real
short-term interest rates by end-2003 and early 2004. Inflation accelerated in 2003 on the back
of expansionary macroeconomic policies and fuel price liberalization. Gross public debt
continued to rise as the federal government resorted to a mixture of market-based and
monetary financing to finance its expansionary policies. As a result of further arrears
accumulation and valuation effects, external debt increased by US$2 billion to US$32.8 billion at
end-2003. Nevertheless, the authorities made efforts to improve relations with Paris Club
creditors, with all but four bilateral negotiations concluded under the 2000 rescheduling
agreement.
Despite record high oil revenue, international reserves continued the downward trend that
started in 2002. Reserves fell for the year by US$213 million to US$7.5 billion (3.8 months of
imports). In line with the terms of trade improvement, expansionary fiscal stance and higher
DAS sales, the real exchange rate has appreciated by 6 percent since end-2002, and remains
about 11½ percent above its 1999 level (when a major realignment took place).
Macroeconomic conditions have improved considerably since late 2003, due largely to fiscal
prudence. The fiscal restraint that began in the last quarter of 2003 continued in the half of
2004. Around US$2 billion in oil revenue was set aside by all tiers of government during the first
six months. The fiscal restraint allowed a net repayment by the government to the banking
system. In addition, the CBN’s shift to daily open-market operations—introduced in November
2003—has helped lower excess liquidity in the banking system. Consequently, 12-month growth
in broad money slowed considerably in the first six months, and foreign exchange market
pressure has eased, facilitating a sharp increase in gross international reserves to
US$10.1 billion at end-May 2004, and a narrowing of the parallel market exchange rate
premium to 4½ percent. After moderating to 17½ percent at end-April, the 12-month inflation
rate picked up again to 19½ percent at end-May 2004 due to higher food prices.
Structural reform efforts have been positive since mid-2003. Several initiatives to improve oil
sector efficiency and enhance public sector transparency and accountability were introduced as
part of NEEDS. First, the price subsidy to NNPC on its domestic crude allocation was eliminated
in October 2003. Furthermore, prices on retail petroleum products were liberalized. Second, the
authorities volunteered to participate in the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI)
and agreed to participate in the African Peer Review Mechanism of the New Economic
Partnership for African Development (NEPAD) and the G8 Transparency Initiative. Third, the
financial sector and the payment system were strengthened in line with Financial Sector

-3-

Assessment Program (FSAP) recommendations. Overall trade protection, however, increased
due to the imposition of ad hoc import bans.
Confidence in the Nigerian economy has improved since the elections and with the appointment
of the new economic team. Nigeria’s spread over the overall JP Morgan Emerging Market Bond
Index Global has tightened by about 550 basis points since April 2003.
Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors welcomed the notable recent improvement in prospects for sustained
adjustment and economic reform in Nigeria, and the authorities’ articulation of the National
Economic Empowerment and Development Strategy, NEEDS—a homegrown medium-term
economic strategy aimed at addressing Nigeria’s deep-rooted macroeconomic and structural
problems and reducing poverty. They fully agreed with its overall policy thrust and direction for
tackling economic development and unleashing Nigeria’s growth potential. Directors viewed the
reform priorities as broadly consistent with the recommendations of previous Article IV
consultations, and marking a clear break from the policies of the past. They stressed that
consistent and determined implementation of NEEDS, backed by complementary strategies at
the sub-national level as well as the support of the international community, will be essential if
Nigeria is to confront successfully the daunting economic and social challenges that lie ahead.
Directors were encouraged by the authorities’ initial progress in implementing the policy agenda
in engagement with the private sector and civil society. A number of policy actions taken since
late 2003, combined with higher oil prices, have contributed to an overall improvement in
macroeconomic performance so far in 2004. Directors commended the fiscal restraint that
allowed much of the oil windfall to be saved, resulting in lower inflation and a sharp increase in
gross international reserves. They saw the elimination of the subsidy on petroleum products as
a bold demonstration of the authorities’ commitment to reform. On the structural front, Directors
welcomed the introduction of an oil price-based fiscal rule at the federal level, improvements in
governance practices, the strengthening of the budget process, and increased policy
coordination, in part through the new Cash Management Committee.
Notwithstanding the recent progress, Directors underlined that economic reform in Nigeria faces
serious risks and challenges, owing primarily to weak institutions, limited technical capacity, and
resistance of entrenched vested interests. Careful prioritization and sequencing of reforms will
be essential to avoid overstretching administrative capacity. Directors endorsed the suggestion
that the authorities should focus their immediate effort on a few reforms that will produce
tangible results and garner public support quickly, and underlined the importance of a sound
communication strategy to persuade public opinion of the benefits of reform. The ongoing civil
service reform and other actions being taken to increase public accountability and transparency
will be crucial steps to strengthen institutions and render the reforms permanent. Directors
commended the authorities’ commitment to improving governance and tackling corruption—as
reflected in Nigeria’s participation in the Extractive Industry Transparency Initiative; the African
Peer Review Mechanism of New Partnership for Africa’s Development; and the
G8 Transparency Initiative. They welcomed the establishment of the Economic and Financial

-4-

Crimes Commission and the publication of the monthly revenue allocations to sub-national
governments.
Achievement of macroeconomic stability will require continued fiscal tightening at the federal
level and the participation of all states in the oil price-based fiscal rule. Directors noted that the
federal government faces a major challenge in reaching agreement with the states to save oil
windfalls, and urged timely passage of the Fiscal Responsibility Bill to provide the legal
foundation for a prudent consolidated fiscal policy. They were disappointed that the
consolidated non-oil fiscal deficit is expected to rise significantly, undermining efforts to restrain
inflation, and called on the states to implement the oil price-based fiscal rule to ensure fiscal
prudence. Fiscal prudence will also require measures to boost non-oil revenue and control
spending, while ensuring that social and developmental needs are met.
Directors observed that the 2004 federal government budget embodies a positive change from
past budgetary practice. The adoption of a fiscal policy framework incorporating an oil price
baseline should help achieve sizable cash savings to buffer against future oil price shocks and
reduce macroeconomic volatility. Directors called on the authorities to build on this progress and
begin the 2005 budget cycle early. They stressed the need to further prioritize the capital
budget, design a strategy to address domestic arrears, and develop a medium-term expenditure
framework consistent with NEEDS.
Directors encouraged the central bank to implement a credible monetary policy framework
aimed at achieving price stability and rebuilding Nigeria’s international reserves. Given the
monetary overhang from 2003 and the persistent inflationary pressures, Directors underscored
the need for the central bank to be vigilant in implementing its monetary program. In particular,
the central bank should avoid financing the budget deficit and should adjust the minimum
rediscount rate if inflationary pressures accelerate. Directors encouraged increased reliance on
indirect monetary policy instruments and reforms to enhance the independence of the central
bank. In addition, they urged the central bank to develop an effective strategy for public
communication of the objectives and stance of monetary policy, so as to establish the credibility
of the monetary framework.
Directors commended the implementation of the recommendations of the Financial Sector
Assessment Program aimed at strengthening the financial sector and the payments system.
They underscored the importance of decisive action against misreporting and underprovisioning and of an exit strategy to address the problem of weak banks, and supported the
authorities’ request for a follow-up FSAP to help address these issues. The establishment of a
Financial Intelligence Unit to strengthen the framework for anti-money laundering was
welcomed.
Directors welcomed the authorities’ intention to unify the foreign exchange market and move
toward a market-determined exchange rate, and supported the authorities’ request for technical
assistance to implement this reform. They also encouraged the authorities to work toward
accepting the obligations of Article VIII of the Fund’s Articles of Agreement. Directors welcomed
the authorities’ launch of a formal review of the import tariff structure with a view to

-5-

implementing the lower common external tariff of the Economic Community of West African
States. However, they expressed concern about Nigeria’s continued reliance on import bans.
They noted that, going forward, comprehensive trade liberalization will be needed to enhance
Nigeria’s competitiveness and boost investment.
Directors welcomed Nigeria’s efforts to improve its debt management practices and address its
domestic and external debt burden. They agreed that development of a treasury bill market
would be helpful in restructuring the domestic debt and reducing rollover risks. Directors
commended the authorities’ improved dialogue initiated with the Paris Club. A number of
Directors called on the authorities to service external debt to the fullest extent possible, and
emphasized the importance of comparable treatment of all creditors. Several Directors
encouraged the authorities to work closely with their creditors towards finding a sustainable
long-term solution to Nigeria’s serious debt problems.
Directors urged the authorities to sustain the privatization effort and create a more businessfriendly environment to boost private sector growth. A regulatory and monitoring framework that
ensures an open and transparent privatization process will be key to encouraging investor
interest in the enterprises concerned.
Directors welcomed the authorities’ request for Fund staff to monitor the implementation of their
program. In view of this request, they generally endorsed the proposed intensified surveillance,
which will involve quarterly staff visits to Nigeria and semi-annual information reports to the
Executive Board. They encouraged the authorities to give highest priority to capacity building,
and reiterated the Fund’s commitment to help Nigeria in this regard. Directors urged the
authorities to continue to make full and effective use of technical assistance based on their
recent initiatives to prioritize technical assistance needs. They called on the authorities to
improve their statistical system, as an essential basis for effective monitoring of economic policy
implementation.

Public Information Notices (PINs) form part of the IMF's efforts to promote transparency of the IMF's
views and analysis of economic developments and policies. With the consent of the country (or
countries) concerned, PINs are issued after Executive Board discussions of Article IV consultations with
member countries, of its surveillance of developments at the regional level, of post-program monitoring,
and of ex post assessments of member countries with longer-term program engagements. PINs are
also issued after Executive Board discussions of general policy matters, unless otherwise decided by
the Executive Board in a particular case.
