IMF Executive Board Approves Three-Year US$115.8 Million Arrangement Under
the ECF for the Central African Republic

On July 20, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) approved a
three-year SDR 83.55 million (about US$115.8 million, 75 percent of quota) arrangement
under the Extended Credit Facility (ECF) for the Central African Republic. The approval
enables the immediate disbursement of SDR 12.525 million (about US$17.4 million),
while the remaining amount will be phased over the duration of the arrangement, subject to
program reviews.
The authorities’ ECF-supported program aims to entrench macroeconomic stability and
create the conditions for sustained and inclusive growth, through structural reforms.
Following the Executive Board’s discussion on the Central African Republic,
Mr. Mitsuhiro Furusawa, Deputy Managing Director, and Acting Chair, made the
following statement:
“The return to democratic institutions in April 2016 offers the Central African Republic a
unique opportunity to consolidate peace, foster inclusive economic growth, and rebuild
national cohesion to exit the current state of fragility. Going forward, and building upon
progress made during the transition, economic reforms and consolidation of peace should
ensure lasting improvements in security conditions and economic development of the
country.
“The new three-year program supported by the Extended Credit Facility seeks to restore
macroeconomic stability through lowering the domestic primary deficit in order to restore

2

debt sustainability, while ramping up poverty-reducing spending and critical capital
investment. Donor support ensures the full financing of the first year of the program, and
there are good prospects for financing the remainder of the program.
“The program’s structural reform agenda focuses on raising domestic revenue to bring it to
the pre-crisis level through a review of tax policy, strengthening tax administration, and
streamlining tax exemptions. Raising domestic resource mobilization to the country’s
potential over the medium term will be key to allow the government to scale up pro-poor
and investment spending. Structural reforms also focus on strengthening public financial
management, improving the efficiency of spending, and restoring control and transparency
in the execution of the budget. Better control of the wage bill would allow new hiring in
the priority health and education sectors. In addition, the authorities’ structural reform
agenda also comprises measures to increase banking intermediation, improve the business
environment, and build institutional capacity. Technical assistance to strengthen capacity
development is a critical element of the program and the authorities have agreed to
participate in the pilot IMF Capacity Building Framework.”
Annex
Recent Economic Developments
The 2013 crises and a protracted political transition in 2014–15 provide the context for
recent economic developments. The economy contracted by an estimated 36.7 percent in
2013, and economic growth remained anemic in the subsequent years, due to structural
rigidities, poor infrastructure and limited energy supply. Inflation reached 11.6 percent in
2014, and receded to 4.5 percent in 2015 thanks to improved supply conditions and a fall
in the prices of basic imports. During this period, the fiscal deficit widened on the back of
declining domestic revenue, which collapsed to below 5 percent of GDP in 2014.
Corrective measures implemented in 2015 allowed revenue to reach 7.1 percent. However,
domestic revenue remains insufficient to cover salary payments and critical expenditure.
The current account deficit has doubled to 9 percent of GDP, mainly reflecting a collapse
in exports of diamonds and forestry products.
Program Summary
The government program, supported by the ECF, aims at restoring macroeconomic
stability, economic growth, job creation and poverty reduction. The program focuses on
enhancing revenue mobilization and improving expenditure efficiency to lower the primary

3

fiscal deficit and scale-up social and infrastructure spending. Measures to improve the
business environment and access to credit should support private sector activity. Technical
assistance and training will be critical to support the implementation of key reforms that
will underpin an economic recovery.
Additional Background
The Central African Republic, which became a member of the IMF on July 10, 1963, has
an IMF quota of SDR 111.4 million. For additional background information on the IMF
and the Central African Republic, see:
http://www.imf.org/external/country/CAF/index.htm.
Executive Directors commended the authorities for the progress achieved under
their economic program supported by the Rapid Credit Facility, which has helped stabilize
the economy, rebuild core administrative capacity and improve the management of public
resources. While the country faces significant challenges, including a high dependency on
external assistance and deep-rooted structural rigidities that hinder economic growth, the
return to the democratization process has opened opportunities for the government to
embark on a comprehensive reform strategy.
Directors supported the authorities’ medium-term priorities that would create the
conditions for sustainable and inclusive growth and a progressive exit from fragility. These
priorities include securing peace and stability, improving competitiveness, enhancing
institutional capacity, and lifting growth prospects to create jobs, combat poverty, and
maintain social cohesion. Directors stressed the importance of rebuilding domestic
institutional capacity to carry out the reform program, supported by technical assistance
from the Fund and other partners.
Directors supported the government’s medium-term fiscal strategy, and emphasized
the need to increase revenue mobilization, improve expenditure control, and restore debt
sustainability. They called for timely implementation of the revenue plan which covers tax
policy, revenue administration, and tax and customs exemptions. Directors underscored the
importance of improving public financial management and the efficiency of public
spending, and welcomed plans for a strengthened treasury single account, an effective
return to normal budget procedures, improved project execution, and enhanced
transparency.

4

Directors urged the adoption of a revised budget for 2016, consistent with the
medium-term fiscal framework, with an emphasis on additional revenue measures, scaled
up social spending and infrastructure investment, as well as the inclusion of appropriate
fiscal buffers to better manage volatility.
Directors emphasized that broad social ownership of the structural reform agenda,
and continued support from development partners, will be key to boost economic activity.
They encouraged the authorities to press ahead with efforts to improve the business
environment and strengthen competitiveness, deepen financial intermediation, and improve
the legal and institutional frameworks.
Directors welcomed the continued engagement of development partners, together
with Fund financial assistance, in meeting the country’s financing needs in 2016 and in the
years ahead. They emphasized the importance of continued strong donor coordination and
the timely disbursement of pledged financial support and provision of technical assistance.
Directors encouraged the authorities to strengthen their institutional framework to better
coordinate such assistance, and welcomed their intention to take part in the pilot Capacity
Building Framework.
Directors welcomed the recent progress in compiling and providing basic
macroeconomic data and emphasized the need for continued improvements to the quality
and timeliness of economic data to strengthen economic management. In this regard,
technical assistance, including from the IMF, would be helpful.

STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2016 ARTICLE IV CONSULTATION
AND REQUEST FOR A THREE-YEAR ARRANGEMENT UNDER
THE EXTENDED CREDIT FACILITY

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
Background: The Central African Republic (C.A.R.) is at a turning point, with the return
to democratic institutions since April 1, 2016 offering prospects of ending the cycle of
violent conflicts and political instability that has beleaguered the country since
end-2012 and also engineering a turnaround to rebuild its economy, reduce poverty,
and exit progressively from fragility. Three disbursements under the Rapid Credit
Facility (RCF) helped to address urgent balance of payments needs and restore
macroeconomic stability during the protracted political transition that lasted from
January 2014 to March 2016. The newly elected government is focusing on reforms for
a progressive exit from fragility, including improving security, consolidating the peace
and the reconciliation process, rebuilding government institutions, and strengthening
economic management.
Article IV Discussions: Discussions focused on strategies to improve revenue
mobilization, strengthen public financial management, promote competitiveness and
debt sustainability, and rebuild capacity to support pro-poor inclusive growth and social
stability.
The Proposed Program: The program focuses on:


Lowering the primary fiscal deficit while ramping up poverty-reduction spending.


Expanding the electricity supply and improving access to credit for crowding in
private sector investment.


Improving administrative capacity, budget transparency, and project management.

Request for an ECF Arrangement: The C.A.R. Authorities request a three-year
arrangement under the ECF in an amount equivalent to SDR 83.55 million (75 percent of
quota) in support of their medium-term economic reform program.
Risks: risks to the program include an absence of political agreement with armed
groups, limited experience of the new government, and delayed provision of financial
assistance from the international community that would jeopardize critical reforms,
including those of the security sector.

CENTRAL AFRICAN REPUBLIC

CONTEXT: POST-CONFLICT PEACEBUILDING AND
RECONSTRUCTION
The return to democratic institutions provides a new window of opportunity for C.A.R. to engage on
the path of national reconciliation, good governance, and better economic management.
1.
The peaceful elections in early 2016 brought to an end a protracted political
transition and the return to democratic institutions. This enhances the prospects of ending
the political instability in the country that erupted in 2013 when armed rebels overthrew the
democratically elected government, leading to violent fighting along religious lines. State
institutions collapsed, economic activity ceased, civilians fled to internal camps or abroad, and a
humanitarian crisis ensued. With help from the international community, a transitional
government was eventually set up in January 2014. The United Nations put in place a peace
keeping mission mandated to restore security, protect civilians, support the transition to
democracy, and restore the rule of law. Following several delays for financial, security or logistical
reasons, presidential and legislative elections were held in early 2016, leading to the election of
President Touadera and a new parliament. The elections were generally acclaimed as free and the
results widely accepted and President Touadera formed a coalition government composed of
representatives from a wide array of political parties, but excluding some minority groups.
2.
The new government is turning its attention to development challenges, with a
focus on peace, governance, and economic management. It has announced that its
long-term objectives are to reduce widespread poverty by reinforcing security, fostering national
reconciliation and social peace, strengthening human and administrative capacity, and
undertaking economic reforms. Consistent with these challenges, the authorities intend to:
(i) undertake a comprehensive reform of the security services (RSS); (ii) further mobilize revenue
collection and rein in non-priority public spending, while ramping up pro-poor spending;
(iii) strengthen the government institutional capacity; and (iv) improve competitiveness.
3.
The RSS will be a key element of the government’s medium-term strategy. This
comprehensive security reform plan is being worked out between the authorities and
stakeholders. The key issues relate to the departure of many old and untrained officers, the place
of the ex-combatants in the society, and the role of a new army, with most of the donors
favoring a shift to a civil security format, with small specialized forces to ensure security. The
reform will require significant financial support from development partners and is not expected
to impact the public finances. It is expected to be submitted to the donor community in
November 2016.

CENTRAL AFRICAN REPUBLIC AND THE IMF
The IMF provided significant support during the 2014-2015 political transition through three
disbursements under the RCF. Performance by the authorities under their program created
favorable conditions for longer term engagement.
4.
The IMF and the international community supported the transition’s government
emergency program with significant financial assistance and targeted technical assistance.
The transition authorities improved treasury management, streamlined the civil service roster to
contain a ballooning wage bill, and put in place a collaborative institutional framework. Donors
provided significant budgetary aid, humanitarian assistance, and project support. The three
successive disbursements under the RCF provided SDR 22.28 million (20 percent of new quota).
5.
In the 2011 Article IV consultation, the authorities were encouraged to maintain
macroeconomic stability while substantially increasing investment to address structural
gap. Directors called for measures to ensure budget execution in line with the priorities
approved by Parliament. They also recommended putting in place a mechanism for adjusting
domestic petroleum products on a monthly basis. Directors stressed the need to strengthen
public debt management, contract new debt on concessional terms to preserve debt
sustainability, and clear arrears. They identified improving financial intermediation, removing
structural rigidities, including expanding access to electricity, and improving the business
environment as key structural reforms to uplift growth prospects. Notwithstanding the political
and security crisis that prevailed, most of these reforms are underway, including those aimed at
enhancing the contribution of the banking sector to growth and expand electricity supply.
6.
Performance under three successive RCF disbursements set the stage for an upper
credit tranche program and staff sees merit in longer-term engagement. The authorities
have rebuilt basic state functions and core capacity, and delivered on macroeconomic
management objectives and structural reforms—even under difficult political and security
conditions. The new authorities have requested an ECF arrangement to meet protracted balance
of payments needs. The latter would persist beyond the medium term because of a slow take off
of their export earnings capacity due to the lingering impact of the partial embargo on diamond
exports,1 low timber prices, and rising imports to meet the country’s food needs and
reconstruction and investment requirements. The ECF-supported program aims to provide a
macroeconomic framework to that will strengthen substantially and in a sustainable manner its
balance of payments position consistent with strong and durable poverty reduction and growth.
In line with this objective, the ECF will help mobilize revenue, improve efficiency of spending,
scale-up social and infrastructure investment, anchor priority structural reforms, and mobilize
and coordinate support from development partners.

The Kimberly Process Certification Scheme (KCPS) lifted the embargo on the sale of diamonds produced in the green zone
(South west part of the country) in June 2015. A partial embargo remains on the diamonds produced in the North East regions,
where the most important mines are located.

RECENT ECONOMIC AND FINANCIAL
DEVELOPMENTS
Despite the progress achieved in the context of the emergency program, economic growth
remained elusive, and fiscal revenue insufficient to cover current primary spending. The return to
democratic institutions and the restoration of a peace –albeit fragile- provides a historic window of
opportunity for C.A.R. to focus on longer term issues.
7.
The crises during 2013 followed by a protracted political transition in 2014–15
provide the context for recent economic developments. Following a 4.1 percent rise in 2012,
real GDP growth contracted by an estimated 36.7 percent in 2013. During the transition,
economic activity remained weak, reaching 1 percent in 2014, before rising to 4.8 in 2015, driven
by an uptick of subsistence agricultural activity, construction, transportation and trade. Inflation
peaked at 11.6 percent in 2014 and receded to 4.5 percent in 2015 thanks to improved supply
conditions resulting from enhanced security along the Douala-Bangui transport corridor, a fall in
the prices of some basic imports, and improved distribution networks (Table 1 and MEFP, ¶5). Per
capita growth, which stagnated throughout the pre-crisis, collapsed in 2012 and did not recover
during the transition. Furthermore, the crisis led to a deterioration of all social indicators, as
suggested by the 2015 Human Development Report which ranked C.A.R. at 187 out of 188
countries, with a Human Development Index significantly lower than the average sub-Saharan
Africa (Box 1).
8.
Fiscal and current account deficits widened. The primary fiscal position shifted from a
small surplus in 2012 to a deficit of 3 percent of GDP in 2015 (Tables 2 and 3). This was
attributable to a collapse in domestic revenue to 4.9 percent of GDP in 2014 (from 11.5 percent
of GDP in 2012) before rebounding to 7.1 percent of GDP in 2015 thanks to corrective measures
taken during the last year of transition. At the same time, current primary spending remained at
about 9.7 percent of GDP, of which 6 percent representing the wage bill. Domestically-financed
capital spending fell to 0.4 percent of GDP in 2015, from 1.5 percent in 2012. The current account
deficit doubled since 2012 to 9 percent of GDP, mainly reflecting a collapse in exports of
diamonds and forestry products.
9.
The treasury situation remained tight during the first half of 2016 despite strong
revenue performance and strict expenditure control (Table 6a). During the first quarter,
domestic revenue, together with the financial reserves accumulated at end-December 2015,
helped cover salaries, pensions, and debt service obligations, including vis-a-vis the IMF. For the
second quarter, the authorities faced a treasury gap of CFAF 10 billion which prompted donors
to provide bridge emergency support as they were reassured by the discussions on a new
ECF-supported program.
10.
The crisis led the country to be assessed at high risk of external debt distress. Public
debt rose from 23.5 percent of GDP in 2012 to 48.5 percent of GDP in 2015, as a result of the
significant fall in GDP and increases in domestic payment arrears. During the emergency period,
C.A.R. received significant support in the form of grants, with limited new debt financing. The first

Box 1. Central African Republic: Exiting the Fragility Trap
Despite its abundant natural resources, C.A.R. has been trapped in persistent fragility
since independence in 1960. C.A.R.’s main sources of fragility include: (i) a lack of common
vision; (ii) weak governance; (iii) lack of education and employment opportunities; and (iv)
lasting political conflicts. These sources reinforce each other and keep CAR in a persistent
“fragility trap”. Protracted political crises led to a deficit of institutions and the disintegration of
the state, and undermined efforts to develop the country’s rich and diverse endowment and
sustainable development path. This fragility trap has kept the country in extreme poverty with
the lowest rankings of social and economic indicators in the world.
The experiences of seven Sub-Saharan African countries that have managed to exit
fragility point to the key drivers for building resilience. Using the World Bank’s Country
Policy and Institutional Assessment (CPIA) ratings and incidents of conflicts to define fragility,
seven countries have been identified as “becoming resilient” since 1990s: Cameroon, Ethiopia,
Mozambique, Niger, Nigeria, Rwanda and Uganda. A panel regression model of the seven
countries is used to regress the CPIA index of the seven countries on the following
independent variables: development aid, tax revenue and current expenditure, education and
health expenditures (all in percent of GDP). Three variables - inflation, growth of real GDP per
capita, and terms of trade - are used as control variables. The sample period covers 14 years
from the most fragile year for each country. The estimation results suggest that maintaining
macroeconomic and political stability, building strong fiscal institutions and collecting
efficiently domestic revenue, scaling up development aid and social spending can help the
countries in building resilience towards exiting fragility.
The key elements of a strategy that can help C.A.R. build resilience to exit fragility
include fostering long-lasting domestic security, maintaining political stability, and
improving macroeconomic performance and creating conditions that are conducive to
economic recovery. Public expenditure should be oriented to priority spending such as
health, education and security and public investment that are essential for engineering
inclusive growth and maintaining political stability. At the same time, it is critical for the
government to build strong fiscal institutions and funding to finance those essential
government services above. Efforts and resources should first focus on “low hanging fruits”
such as strengthening cash management, VAT and petroleum taxation and strengthening the
treasury single account. In addition, scaling up external budget assistance and technical
support in capacity building can help CAR address its daunting challenges of overcoming
persistent fragility through security and economic reforms. This requires strong coordination
between the United Nations, development partners, and security partners.
major loan was signed in December 2015 by the Transition Government with Saudi Arabia for
CFAF 45 billion (5 percent of GDP) to finance investment in infrastructure and social sectors. The
loan is concessional with a grant element of 49 percent.
11.
The financial sector, the smallest in CEMAC, is largely underdeveloped and plays a
limited role in supporting the economy. Only about 1 percent of the population holds a bank
account and 0.5 percent has access to credit. Access to mobile banking remains low, dampening
the potential expansion of access to financial services (Figure 1). The fragile security, together
with the absence of appropriate guarantee instruments, the lack of long-term resources, and a
poor judicial system capable of supporting debt collection are impediments to a sound credit
expansion to the private sector, beyond a small core of clients that have adequate accounting
practices. Demand for credit was at the same time weak reflecting the fragile security
environment and the loss of investors’ assets during the crisis. Financial sector indicators show
that while the overall liquidity has increased in 2015, banks’ asset quality remains precarious
(Table 9 and MEFP, ¶8 and ¶9). Non-performing loans represent close to one third of all loans,
mostly due to the large stock of outstanding government payment arrears (about 50 percent of

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

the sector’s NPLs), and government arrears to its suppliers. Banks have recently increased
provisioning of NPLs to about 70 percent (compared with about 50 percent in March 2015),
reducing banks’ capital, which remains broadly adequate, and profitability. Bank lending activities
tend to be concentrated in short-term loans to the public sector, leaving banks exposed to
sovereign risk.

MEDIUM-TERM CHALLENGES AND POLICIES:
INCLUSIVE GROWTH AND DEBT SUSTAINABILITY
Article IV consultation discussions focused on policies to restore macroeconomic stability by
enhancing domestic revenue mobilization and improving public financial management;
strengthening competitiveness and restoring debt sustainability; and strengthening the capacity
building framework (CBF) needed to support this range of reforms.

A. Main challenges to the recovery and sustained and inclusive growth
12.
The authorities stressed their commitment to address the following challenges
facing the country, in their efforts to boost growth:


Consolidating peace and security, and re-establishing state authority throughout the
country: Security has been improving with the help of the UN peacekeeping mission and the
French military contingent, SANGARIS. Nevertheless, security conditions remain volatile in,
Bangui, the capital city and in some other parts of the country, including the North-East
diamond-producing regions, which remain under the full control of armed groups, hindering
the restoration of state authority.2 The return and resettlement of refugees and internally
displaced persons (IDPs) are a major political, economic and social priority. The disarmament,
demobilization, reintegration, and reinsertion of ex-combatants into civilian life are crucial to
reduce security risks and boost economic activity. The security policy is being reshaped, with
a view to scale up, in a context of a civil security format, specialized forces (police and
gendarmerie), with adequate training and equipment needs. The needs for the latter are
significant to enable the security forces to maintain state authority across the country. At the
same time, a concerted reconciliation campaign is needed, as the fighting has divided the
population along religious lines. The authorities are designing, in concertation with their
partners, a security reform that will redefine the respective roles of the army, gendarmerie
and police, that will be complemented with training and capacity building.



Restoring and building basic infrastructure and utilities: Even before the 2013 crisis, the
supply of electricity and access to safe drinking water were poor and mainly limited to
Bangui. Large parts of the country were inaccessible due to the poor road conditions which
deteriorated further during the crisis. Private economic infrastructure has been destroyed,
from factories in the forestry sector to service providers, including in the oil sector where
there are only 8 gasoline stations for the whole country. The authorities are already
implementing, with their development partners, an investment plan in the energy sector (that
is expected to double power generation over the next three years) and road transportation.

2
A wave of violence erupted in the middle of June 2016 in Bangui and also in the Northern part of the country. MINUSCA’s
intervention helped restore a fragile security.



Mobilizing domestic revenues and returning to normal budget procedures: In the face
of such daunting challenges, domestic resources are scarce and insufficient to meet wage
payments, key social outlays and external debt service. This has led to a significant
dependence on external aid which reached 27 percent of GDP in 2015 after a plateau of
43 percent of GDP in 2014 (Figure 2 Text Table 1). Rebuilding and modernizing the revenue
administration, improving tax policy, and restoring normal budget processes are the
cornerstone for the return to fiscal sustainability and to ensure that expenditures are well
managed. The authorities have adopted actions plans to address these challenges. On the
revenue side, they intend to review the tax policy and the management of their natural
resources. On the expenditure side, the authorities intend to move ahead with the second
phase of the wage bill reform, including human resource management.



Improving social conditions: Social and economic conditions are among the lowest in the
world, as reflected in C.A.R.’s rank of 187 out of 188 countries on the UNDP 2015 Human
Development Index (Figure 3). Raising income levels – which stagnated before collapsing in
2012 (Figure 4) – and improving access to health, education, and safe drinking water, are
therefore critical to reduce widespread poverty and promote human development. The
authorities will redeploy social service in the country and undertake significant investments in
health and education.

and projections.

Improving competitiveness. C.A.R. ranked 185th out of 189 countries on the World Bank
Doing Business Index for 2016. It ranked bottom on four of the ten components of the index:
paying taxes, trading across borders, enforcing contracts, and resolving insolvency; and close
to bottom on the remaining six components. The Heritage Foundation’s Index of Economic
Freedom shows weaknesses in property rights, corruption, and business freedom. C.A.R.
ranked 145th out of 167 countries on Transparency International’s 2015 corruption
perceptions index. The authorities have started an inclusive dialogue with the private sector
and they are taking steps are reducing red tapes, corruption and improving financial sector
intermediation.

13.
Staff argued that the real effective exchange rate (REER) has appreciated sharply.
Following a long period of stability, the REER appreciated by almost 63 percent from 2013 to
2015, mainly reflecting the sharp increase in inflation observed during the crisis. This highlights
the substantially weaker external position for C.A.R (see attached technical note on the external
sector assessment). The authorities agreed with staff assessment of the external sector. They
noted that inflationary pressures are receding and they are ready to take further actions to bring
the consumer price inflation in line with the regional convergence rate. C.A.R. participates in a
currency union and the exchange system common to all members operates without restrictions
on the making of payments and transfers for current transactions (see informational annex).
14.
The loss of competitiveness would be best addressed by the removal of structural
bottlenecks to growth. Enhancing C.A.R. non-price competitiveness requires substantial
structural reforms to improve: (i) the challenging business environment (especially the
cumbersome business, regulatory, and trade regulations for starting a business, getting

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

12

CENTRAL AFRICAN REPUBLIC

electricity and accessing credit); and (ii) the institutional and governance environment (especially
the labor and competition policies, as well as the quality of public administration). The authorities
agreed with staff’s assessment and are committed to move forward with such reforms (simplified
investment code and updated mining code and telecommunications regulations) that would
generate, over time, tangible productivity gains, mainly by bolstering private sector investment
and expansion as well as public sector efficiency (including through more effective policy making
and use of development assistance).

B. Restoring macroeconomic stability through fiscal reforms
15.
Maintaining macroeconomic stability is a prerequisite for growth. Staff and the
authorities agreed that macroeconomic stability and structural reforms should help lift growth
prospects and attract investors. On the fiscal side, with external budget support expected to
steadily decline over the medium term, the emphasis will be on efforts to mobilize domestic
resources and control spending through key structural reforms. The authorities have readied
medium-term action plans to that effect. They noted, however, that low capacity, the continued
presence of armed groups, the poor state of the revenue administration, deep-rooted rigidities,
and the high expectations of the populations require careful prioritization of reforms, continued
external support, and further technical assistance. Taking into account these constraints, staff and
the authorities agreed on a set of medium-term macroeconomic policies and reforms that would
pave the way for a return to macroeconomic stability and sustainable growth (MEFP, ¶11).
Enhancing revenue mobilization
16.
Staff and the authorities concurred to further increase domestic revenues through
the implementation of the medium-term action plan prepared in 2015 and updated in
March 2016 together with an FAD TA mission. With a view to raise domestic revenue from
7.1 percent of GDP in 2015 to 10.1 percent of GDP by 2019, the plan aims at: (i) broadening the
tax base and simplifying tax procedures, including improving management of the VAT system
and the base for assessing export taxes; (ii) strengthening tax and customs administration,
including introducing pre-completed tax returns for real estate; revision of fiscal exemptions
agreements; (iii) harmonization of the General Investment Code by implementing the CEMAC
directives on VAT and duties; and (iv) streamlining and enhancing management of tax
exemptions (MEFP, ¶17).
Improving public financial management and the efficiency of spending
17.
Staff and the authorities concurred on the need to keep the wage bill in check.
Efforts will continue to bring the wage bill down from 6 percent of GDP in 2015 to 4.5 percent of
GDP in 2019 (MEFP, ¶15). In this context, the authorities are planning to continue streamlining
the public sector work force through: (i) the continued cleaning of the civil service roster; (ii) the
timely retirements of eligible civil servants (CFAF 150 millions); (iii) the gradual elimination of
non-regular civil servants (CFAF 150 millions); and (iv) the repatriation of diplomats whose
assignments have ended in 2016 or before (CFAF 60 millions). The expected savings for the
period 2016-19 will help scale up poverty spending and domestically-financed investment
INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

13

spending, and clear more domestic payments arrears. Staff will assess, with the authorities, the
budgetary impact of the reforms in the security sector, once finalized, ahead of an international
donor conference scheduled in November 2016.
18.
Staff and the authorities agreed that the cash constraint is the fundamental anchor
of the program. Accordingly, they will pursue strict treasury management and widen the
coverage of treasury operations. This will help: (i) ensure that more efforts will be made at
revenue mobilization; (ii) calibrate available resources with priority spending; and (iii) avoid
accumulating domestic payments arrears. In this regard, the authorities have prepared a monthly
treasury plan for 2016 and 2017 (Tables 6a & 6b) whose execution will be monitored by the
Treasury committee through monthly review meetings chaired by the Minister of Finance and
Budget.
19.
Staff and the authorities agreed to strengthen the fiscal policy framework to
improve public financial management (PFM) and the efficiency of public spending. The
authorities prepared, with the support of the Fund and other partners, an action plan aimed at
improving and modernizing public financial management (MEFP, ¶18-19). The objectives of the
plan are to: (i) secure and strengthen treasury management by widening the coverage of treasury
operations to all government operations and identifying all government accounts in commercial
banks and move towards a reinforced single Treasury account; (ii) strengthen the recently
established Central Accounting and Treasury Agency (ACCT), including launching a sensitization
campaign to explain the role of this new unit; (iii) normalize the expenditure process
(commitment, settlement, authorization, payment) and limit emergency spending procedures
(budget and cash payment orders) to 5 percent of non-wage and debt-service expenditures;
(iv) re-establish proper accounting practices for all government operations, for the general
budget and budget annexes, including reinforcing the public management information system to
produce monthly accounting balances; and (v) re-establish the credibility of the state by fighting
corruption and fraud and by re-gaining creditor confidence. In this context, the government will
rigorously enforce the law requiring ministers to declare their assets within 60 days of
appointment. Furthermore, it is considering creating a committee of wise persons to pave the
way for implementing a coherent anti-corruption framework, following international best
practices. At the same time, a plan is under discussion to improve the public investment
framework to enhance project execution.

C. Restoring debt sustainability through a strengthening of public debt
management and implementation of a prudent borrowing policy
20.
Staff and the authorities concurred on the need to strengthen external debt
management. The Debt Sustainability Analysis (DSA) puts C.A.R. at high risk of debt distress,
compared with a moderate risk of debt distress in the last Article IV consultation in 2012
(MEFP, ¶22). The current rating reflects the collapse in GDP, tax revenues and exports—rather
than an increase in external debt. At end-May 2016, C.A.R. owes close to US$93.7 million of preHIPC Initiative arrears to Argentina, Equatorial Guinea, Iraq, Libya, and Montenegro. C.A.R. also
has arrears to the French export guarantee institute, COFACE. Argentina and France have

14

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

CENTRAL AFRICAN REPUBLIC

consented to IMF financing in the context of a new ECF arrangement notwithstanding these
arrears. The remaining creditors have requested more time to consider consenting to IMF
financing. C.A.R. arrears to the Saudi Development Fund amount to US$1.26 million, which arose
during the emergency period. The government has contacted the authorities of Saudi Arabia to
inform them of their intention to resolve these arrears. An update will be circulated to the
Executive Board not later than a week prior to the scheduled Board consideration. C.A.R. is also in
arrears to two French private entities, and is continuing to make good faith efforts to finalize/and
reach a collaborative agreement with them. Large accumulation of domestic arrears also
contributed to an increase in total public debt. In view of the high risk of debt distress, staff and
the authorities agreed that grants should be the main source of external financing. Concessional
financing, with a grant element of at least 50 percent could be pursued after consultation with
staff (Text table 2). At the same time, the revised finance law for 2016 will explicitly confer the
authority to contract public debt, including government-guaranteed debt, exclusively to the
Minister in charge of Finance and Budget.

D. Improving the capacity building framework
21.
Staff and the authorities concurred on the need to further build capacity to support
and undertake major reforms. During the emergency phase, the authorities put in place an
institutional framework to rebuild capacity, coordinate technical assistance, and monitor reforms
undertaken in the context of the RCF. This framework will be strengthened to enhance donor
coordination and leverage capacity building and technical assistance (TA) resources to maximize
synergies and increase effectiveness. The authorities agreed to be part of the Capacity Building
Framework (CBF) pilot project (Box 2), which they consider as a powerful tool to mobilize and
coordinate timely TA and use it efficiently to ensure the success of their program (MEFP, ¶30).

E. Social policy
22.
Social policy is a critical component of the authorities’ strategy to exit fragility and
rebuild national cohesion (MEFP, ¶28). The overarching goals of the government are:
(i) assisting the IDPs and refugees return to their lands and assets; (ii) reorganizing and
redeploying public administration throughout the country; (iii) improving access to drinking
water, sanitation, and hygiene; (iv) rehabilitating educational facilities to ensure full coverage and
quality education at all levels to children of both sexes, across the country; and (v) revitalizing the
health system, including strengthening the fight against HIV/AIDS.

Box 2. Proposed Capacity Building Framework

Challenges and lessons from recent technical assistance (TA) provision: During the
political transition period from January 2014 to March 2016, the donor community offered
technical assistance (TA) in the areas of treasury management, public financial management
(connecting the key modules of the public finance management system), and macro fiscal
capacity. In addition, a bilateral donor posted several long term experts covering budget,
customs, the wage bill, and aid management. Delivery of Fund TA was hampered by the
suspension of TA missions due to the deterioration of the security conditions.
Forward-looking macro challenges and policy priorities: Looking ahead, TA will be needed
to help the authorities: (i) improve VAT collection; (ii) rationalize tax and customs exemptions;
(iii) reform the tax and customs administration; and (iv) reform the diamond, telecom and
forestry taxation. On public financial management, the focus will be on improving the
accounting framework and the reporting system while building some macro fiscal capacity.
Regarding the wage bill, the focus will be on completing the cleaning of the roster, securing
the final register, simplifying hiring procedures, implementing management and training tools
for human resource managers and assessing performance. On public debt management, TA
will be needed to: (i) modernize the institutional and regulatory framework for public debt
management; (ii) improve debt management strategy; (iii) strengthen analytical and
operational capabilities of debt managers; and (iv) strengthen the capacity to record and
monitor public debt. Lastly, TA will aim at improving macro fiscal capacity and statistics,
including national accounts, consumer prices, and balance of payments.
Fund TA: In the context of a new ECF arrangement, TA priorities that will be covered by Fund
are: (i) macro fiscal capacity; (ii) tax policy; (iii) revenue administration; (iv) macroeconomic
statistics; and (v) public debt management.
Main results expected from TA during 2016–19: The timely provision of TA will help the
authorities achieve the following measurable targets: (i) improve domestic revenue from
7.1 percent of GDP in 2015 to 10.1 percent in 2019; (ii) reduce the wage bill from 6 percent of
GDP in 2015 to 4.5 of GDP in 2018, including hiring new staff to meet the needs in the social
sectors; (iii) produce the treasury balances on a quarterly basis, starting in 2016.
Milestones in terms of outcomes: They are as follows: (i) link annual budget preparations
and the medium-term macroeconomic framework underpinning the authorities ‘growth and
poverty reduction strategy; (ii) improve revenue from the downstream oil sector, forestry and
mining sectors; (iii) streamline tax exemptions: (iv) streamline and modernize processes for
large taxpayers/importers, secure revenue collection through commercial banks network, and
prevent and fight against VAT fraud; (v) improve compilation in national accounts, and
immediate review CPI compilation for 2013 to eliminate methodological errors and ensure
consistency with the series in 2014 and 2015; and (vi) review the institutional and regulatory
framework for public debt management and improve debt management strategy in 2016.
Authorities’ absorptive constraints: Domestic administrative capacity—already low before
the crisis—has further weakened in 2013 due to losses in terms of staffing, equipment and
infrastructures. The Ministry of Finance and Budget, the Institute of Statistics and Prices, and
the Ministry of Planning and International Cooperation, the three government units involved in
economic and financial affairs are understaffed, poorly equipped, and work under difficult
conditions, including a lack of sufficient energy to power computers and office equipment. As
part of their CBF pilot, the new authorities are committed to improve capacity and make the
best use of the TA that will be provided by the development partners and the Fund. They are
also committing to train staff in place and hire young qualified staff if possible.
Risks: The first risk relates to security which remains volatile despite recent progress. Other
risks include delayed support from the development partners, and the lack of local qualified
experts. This could limit the effectiveness of the new TA on improving capacity. To mitigate the
security risk, the authorities are planning to send staff to outside locations for training. To
offset the lack of specialized local staff, they plan to hire young college graduates and train
them in the specialty identified as crucial to improve capacity.

F. Data for surveillance
23.
Data provided by the authorities are broadly adequate to monitor key economic
and financial developments, albeit with some delays. However, national accounts, consumer
inflation, and external trade data are weak. The authorities agreed with staff on the need to
eliminate delays and improve the frequency and quality of the data. They have reached out to
the IMF Statistics Department for technical assistance to address these issues over the next few
months.

A NEW ECF ARRANGEMENT: BUILDING RESILIENCE
AND HARNESSING PEACE DIVIDENDS
In line with medium-term challenges identified in the Article IV discussions, the new program seeks
to entrench macroeconomic stability and create the conditions for sustained and inclusive growth,
through structural reforms.

A. Entrenching macroeconomic stability in a context of risks
24.
The macroeconomic framework of the ECF-supported program is built upon
achievable growth rates (MEFP, ¶11). With improved security conditions, real GDP growth is
projected at 5.2 percent in 2016, and should remain around an average of 5.5 percent in the
medium term, reflecting a rebound in agriculture following the return of the remaining IDPs and
refugees, a continued pick up in trade and transportation, and a boost in construction with the
implementation of major public investment projects in energy and social sectors. Inflation is
projected to return to the regional convergence rate of 3 percent, associated with the increase in
agricultural output and better supply conditions. The current account deficit is projected to
remain at about 9.7 percent of GDP given the sizable imported reconstruction material needs.
Gross official foreign reserves are projected to rise steadily from 4 months of imports in 2016 to
5 months of imports in 2019, a level that helps the country smooth consumption and face
external shocks. Financing needs, which are covered, are expected to decline from 4.8 percent of
GDP in 2016 to 3.2 percent of GDP in 2019.
25.
The risks to the program are tilted to the downside. They include: (i) a resumption of
violent conflict which could prevent implementation of the program, lead to a return to, or
escalation of the use of emergency spending procedures, and undermine the economic recovery
that the program seeks to achieve; (ii) delayed disbursements in donor funding for both the
economic and security reforms, including the disarmament, demobilization, and reintegration of
ex-combatants; and (iii) the inexperience of the new government. The materialization of these
risks (see the Risk Assessment Matrix Table 11) could complicate policy implementation and
hinder growth prospects (Box 3 and text table 3).

Box 3: Risks and Alternative Policy Responses

Staff and the authorities discussed the scenario of protracted lower growth and agreed on
possible policy responses to meet the program target. Continued volatile security conditions
associated with delays in security reforms and slow recovery of the agriculture, mining and forestry
can lead to lower growth and higher inflation. This would result in a higher domestic primary
deficit, higher financing gap, and higher public debt compared to the program target. Lower
exports and wider current account deficits would lead to a slower increase in international
reserves. In this context, the financing gaps will be covered through a mix of additional adjustment
averaging 1 percent of GDP (authorities are committed to reduce domestically-financed capital
spending, delay new hiring, and restrain other non-priority current spending) and a less-ambitious
arrears clearance strategy.

B. Taking a gradual fiscal adjustment path and building fiscal buffers
26.
Staff and the authorities agreed on a medium-term fiscal strategy that strikes a
balance between the speed of restoring fiscal sustainability and supporting social spending
and economic growth. It will entail: (i) bringing down the domestic primary deficit through
steady implementation of reforms to improve revenue collection (Text table 3) and keep
spending under control, notably the wage bill, while ramping up social and infrastructure outlays;
(ii) managing the outstanding stock of domestic payment arrears to restore confidence in the
state and boost private economic activity; (iii) building fiscal buffers to weather volatility; and
(iv) reforming the public investment program framework to ensure efficient execution of the
public investment program. In line with this strategy, staff and the authorities have agreed on a
revised budget for 2016 that will contain the domestic primary balance to 3.3 percent of GDP
(MEFP, ¶13 and ¶15).

27.
Staff and the authorities reached understandings on a reduction in the domestic
primary deficit, the fiscal anchor of the program, to 0.9 percent of GDP in 2019, from
3.0 percent in 2015. This will be achieved through reforms that will lead to a rise in domestic
revenue from 7.1 percent in 2015 to 10.1 percent of GDP in 2019. Higher revenue will result from
measures to improve the tax base, simplify procedures, modernize revenue administration, and
reduce exemptions (Text table 4). On the spending side, the program targets a rise of
1.5 percentage points of GDP to 16.4 percent during the same period, as the decline in the wage
bill (1.5 percentage points of GDP) (Box 4) will be offset by higher goods and services, transfers
and subsidies (including pensions) and domestically-financed capital spending which would
cumulatively increase from 4.1 percent of GDP in 2015 to 6.4 percent in 2019.
28.
Higher revenue mobilization will be a central element of the economic program.
While the 2016 budget contains a set of revenue measures amounting to CFAF 5.6 billion,3 staff
and the new government identified low hanging fruits that are expected to be included in a
revised budget to be sent to Parliament by August 2016. These measures include a modification
of the petroleum products price structure to base it on Platts international prices, a revised
valuation base for the exports of forestry products, and a more rigorous application of the
existing convention with banks on revenue collection to enhance traceability (MEFP, ¶13). These
measures are projected to increase revenue by CFAF 2.2 billion (0.2 percent of GDP) in the last
quarter of 2016.
29.
To safeguard downstream oil revenue in the future, staff and the authorities
discussed introducing in 2017 a new pricing mechanism allowing for a full pass-through of
international prices to domestic prices. The new pricing mechanism would enhance efficiency
in the marketing and consumption of petroleum products, while obviating the need to use scarce
budgetary resources to subsidize petroleum products in the event of higher international oil
prices. The authorities intend to request technical assistance to shift to this new pricing
The reforms envisaged in the context of the initial budget for 2016 included: (i) extending the tax base for income tax;
(ii) increasing the VAT rate to 5 percent for previously exempted staples; (iii) modifying the payment procedures for the
property tax through an auto-filled return; (iv) strengthening tax and customs controls, including on oil, mining, and forestry
activities; (v) improving VAT collection: (vi) introducing special taxes on tobaccos and transport activities: (vii) implementing an
integrated computerized system connecting the customs offices in Doula and Bangui; and (viii) strengthening controls on tax
and customs exemptions.

mechanism and simplify the tax components (which presently comprises a range of earmarked
taxes). The introduction of the new pricing mechanism would be accompanied by a social safety
net program which would be part of a wider social protection program for vulnerable groups.
Most importantly, it will be part of the government’s plan to also increase the number of
gasoline stations to improve service to consumers.
30.
Built-in fiscal buffers will be crucial to face the impact of volatility. In the absence of
short term debt instruments, staff and the government concurred on the need to build deposits
of about 0.5 percent of GDP by end-2016, and 1.5 percent by 2019 to hedge against volatile aid
disbursements, and enable it to regularly pay for wages, pensions and priority spending. These
buffers should cover about 2 months of wages, pensions and external debt service (MEFP, ¶12).
31.
The program will also focus on the orderly clearance of the large outstanding stock
of domestic arrears. This is central to the authorities’ efforts to rehabilitate public financial
management and support the economy (MEFP, ¶21). The recent agreement with BEAC, the
regional central bank, to consolidate government liabilities totaling CFAF 55 billion is one
element of the strategy.4 The ongoing EU-funded audit of government debt with commercial
banks and other contractors (CFAF 30 billion) should lead to the adoption of an action plan to
clear them in early 2017, including through securitization. Audits for the other payments arrears,
including debt, suppliers, and cross-debts are expected to be launched in the next few months,
with a view to adopt by July 2017 an overall plan to settle all arrears. In this context, cutting
suppliers arrears is expected to be the top priority.
32.
Staff also urged the authorities to strengthen the project management framework.
This will help restructure the current public investment program and facilitate project execution.
In this context, the upgrade will cover all the stages of project management, including
identification of projects, preparation and evaluation, inclusion in the national budget, on site
and financial execution, and regular reporting. The authorities agreed that the current framework
is weak and needs to be reformed, but noted that they will need significant technical assistance
from donors to undertake this crucial task.

C. Improving the business environment
33.
Structural reforms will focus on modernizing and updating the legal framework in
the major economic sectors. The authorities have initiated discussions on such reforms in the
context of the recently established mixed framework for improving business (CMAA). Two bills
aimed at boosting telecommunications activities are under preparation and are expected to be
submitted to parliament early next year. The authorities are also updating the investment charter,
the mining code, and forestry regulation. Furthermore, steps are taken to establish a one-stop
shop for administrative procedures for investors (MEFP, ¶26).

34.
Staff and the authorities agreed on the need to address the shortcomings in the
banking sector, increase lending to private sector and better support economic
growth (MEFP, ¶24) through increased financial intermediation. In addition to strengthening
the judicial system to help settle disputes between bank borrowers and lenders the authorities
will also: (i) monitor risk management and lending practices to address prudential risks; and
(ii) implement an action plan to set up commercial and land registries. Furthermore, they plan to
authorize more banks to conduct mobile banking and hold in 2016 a number of training
seminars to educate the banks, enterprises, and the public on provision of transparent financial
accounts, savings instruments, micro-financing, and collateralized assets. The authorities are
requesting technical assistance in undertaking these reforms, including setting up a credit
bureau. In addition, the authorities are exploring the option to assessing, with financial support
from development partners, the feasibility of setting up a guarantee fund to promote financing
for small and medium enterprises.

D. Program modalities and access
35.
It is proposed that C.A.R.’s program be supported by an arrangement under the
Fund’s Extended Credit Facility (ECF) over three years. The financing gap is projected to
decline from 4.8 percent of GDP in 2016 to 3.2 percent of GDP in 2019. With a cumulative gap of
CFAF 190 billion, the proposed access of 75 percent of quota (SDR 83.55 million or equivalent to
about CFAF 68 billion) is sufficient to close about 36 percent of the gap. Access would be below
the norm. Staff proposes a slightly frontloaded disbursement schedule for the first year of the
program (Table 10), that would help C.A.R. cover the large financing need in 2016, and the heavy
repayment schedule to the Fund. For 2016, the World Bank, the African Development Bank, the
European Union, and France have committed resources amounting to CFAF 30 billion which
together with Fund support will help cover the CFAF 50 billion gap (Table 7). For the first half of
2017, financing needs are projected at CFAF24 billion. They will be covered by drawings on the
financial reserves accumulated at end-December 2016, disbursements from donors who have
tentatively committed at this stage CFAF 10.2 billion, and IMF support.5 For the remainder
program period there are good prospects that any residual gaps will be filled. The first test dates
would be end-August and end-December 2016. C.A.R. has a good track record of financial
relations with the Fund and an adequate capacity to repay (Table 8). Fund support is essential for
the successful implementation of C.A.R.’s economic program, and its catalytic role in the
mobilization of budget support from multilateral and bilateral partners will help ensure that the
program is fully financed. Looking forward, additional support for the outer years is expected to
be discussed at a donors’ conference in October, including the World Bank turnaround facility.

5

In early May, The BEAC Board of Governors agreed to extend the C.A.R. authorities an exceptional advance for
an amount of CFAF 9.24 billion. Staff and the government agreed to use this advance only as a bridge loan in
case a disbursement is delayed. Once the latter takes place, the amount disbursed will be repaid. The government
will consult with staff each time such case arises.

Box 4. Central African Republic: The Wage Bill

A rising wage bill. During 2014–15, the transition government, with technical and financial
support from the World Bank and UNDP, cleaned the civil service roster with a view to
bringing the wage bill to CFAF 50.8 billion, its 2012 level, the year before the major political
and security conflict of 2013. This implied the reduction of 2,500 civil servants for a saving of
CFAF 4.8 billion. However, by end of 2015, the number of civil servants was reduced by only
1,261 and the savings amounted to CFAF 2.8 billion. By end-2015, the wage bill reached
CFAF 56.4 billion (6 percent of GDP). The sharp rise of the wage bill reflects a set of factors,
including: (i) the difficult context against which the reform was conducted; (ii) weak
administrative hiring practices; (iii) the

New measures to reduce the wage bill.
The new government continues to work
closely with the World Bank and the UNDP
to clean up the civil service roster and reduce the wage bill. Measures to that effect in the
context of the third phase of the reform of the wage bill will include: (i) continue the cleaning
of the civil service roster through a reduction in the number of “ghost workers and the holders
of high level posts, the repatriation of the diplomats who ended their assignment (structural
benchmark at end-December 2016), and the timely retirement of thee eligible staff ; (ii) secure
the final register; (iii) clarify the recruitment procedures; (iv) implement management and
training tools for human resource managers using computer applications adapted to CAR;
(v) assess performance. At the same time, the military roster will be cleaned, including
accelerating the removal of 700 retirees from the roaster. Uncertainty remains on the size of
the army, police and gendarmerie.
New recruitment. As the government proceeds with the administration redeployment and
implements its strategy to improve social services and improve security, there will be staffing
needs to meet. The authorities are currently assessing those needs and their costs in
preparation for the donors’ conference that will take place before end-year in Brussels. The
cost of hiring new staff in the priority social sectors will be offset to a certain extent by gains
made through the continued cleaning of the civil services roster.

Performance will be monitored through quantitative performance criteria,
indicative targets, and structural benchmarks (MEFP ¶31). Quantitative performance criteria
will include: (i) a ceiling on net credit to the government; (ii) a floor on domestic revenues; (iii) a
ceiling on the domestic primary deficit; and (iv) a floor on repayment of domestic payment
arrears. Continuous performance criteria will include zero ceilings on: (i) non-concessional public
and publicly guaranteed debt; and (ii) the accumulation of public sector external payment
arrears. An indicative floor will be set for social expenditures. Structural conditionality will focus
on supporting domestic revenue, PFM, debt management, and governance. Structural
conditionality for the second half of 2017 and 2018 will be proposed at the time of the first
review, drawing on significant TA projected in the near time.
37.
The authorities attach the highest importance to the success of their program
(MEFP, ¶32). In this context, it will be monitored at the highest levels of the government,
including the staffs of the Office of the Presidency, the Prime Minister, the Ministry of Finance
and Budget, and the BEAC. Technically, the program will be implemented by the Economic
Reform Monitoring Committee (CS-REF), a unit under the authority of the Minister of Finance
and Budget that includes representatives of the various ministries and agencies involved in
economic and financial affairs.

E. Other considerations
38.
Staff noted progress in the implementation of the BEAC’s safeguards
recommendations. The implementation of safeguards recommendations is currently reviewed
annually and is a pre-condition for granting new IMF financial support to, and reviewing existing
IMF financial arrangements with CEMAC countries. The 2016 safeguards monitoring visit found
that two priority recommendations remain outstanding. However, in early May 2016, the BEAC
Board mandated the institution to initiate work on improving governance and transitioning to
International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS). This is an important initial step toward
successful completion of safeguards reform. The authorities should maintain the momentum on
the implementation of the reforms to restore credibility on the BEAC’s ability to safeguard IMF
financial resources.

STAFF APPRAISAL
39.
C.A.R. is exiting slowly from a multifaceted crisis. C.A.R. plunged into another
political, security, and humanitarian crisis in 2013 that erased all gains achieved during the period
2002–12. This latest crisis led to the collapse of the economy and the disintegration of state
institutions. The transition government in place during 2014–15 implemented an emergency
program that helped improve treasury management, reduce the wage bill, rebuild core
administrative capacity, and put in place a participative institutional framework to manage public
resources in a transparent way. Despite commendable efforts under difficult circumstances,
economic growth remained anemic and domestic resources insufficient to cover current primary
spending. The economy remains highly dependent on external assistance, and deep-rooted

24

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

CENTRAL AFRICAN REPUBLIC

structural rigidities hinder economic growth. The return to democratic institutions in early
April 2016 offers an opportunity for the new authorities to embark on a comprehensive reform
strategy that will create conditions for sustainable and inclusive growth and a progressive exit
from fragility with support from development partners.
40.
Raising C.A.R.’s growth rate requires bold reforms to secure peace and stability,
improve competitiveness and enhance the institutional capacity. The cumulative growth rate
of less than 6 percent achieved during the past two years has been insufficient to offset the
significant loss of output caused by the 2013 crisis. It is crucial for C.A.R. to lift its growth rates
(5-5.5 percent) to create jobs, combat poverty, and maintain social cohesion. This will require a
sustainable fiscal environment but also comprehensive structural reforms, including simplifying
procedures to create businesses, expanding the electricity supply, facilitating access to credit,
and building road infrastructures. Sustainable growth will also require developing the domestic
institutional capacity to carry out project execution and implementing in a timely fashion the
comprehensive reform program. The current framework is an adequate base on which to further
strengthen capacity.
41.
A steady implementation of fiscal reforms will be key to restoring fiscal
sustainability and supporting growth. The authorities have appropriately focused on an
adjustment strategy that is based on both revenue mobilization and expenditure control. Staff
welcomes the recent updating with support from technical assistance of the Fund the authorities’
medium-term revenue reform plans covering tax policy, revenue administration and tax and
customs exemptions. Equally important is the adoption with assistance from the development
partners and the Fund of a medium term plan to enhance expenditure management. Staff urges
the authorities to implement these plans to rein in the domestic primary deficit, free resources to
ramp up spending in social sectors and enable a timely return to fiscal sustainability in support of
sustainable growth.
42.
PFM reforms should continue to focus on enhancing spending quality. This will
include a strengthened treasury single account, together with the effective return to normal
budget procedures, improved project execution, and enhanced transparency. In this context, staff
urges the authorities to resist using exceptional spending procedures under warranted by
exceptional circumstances, strengthen the efficiency of the public financial management
information system, improve accounting procedures and fiscal reporting, and reform the public
investment. These are crucial steps to normal budget execution. Last but not least, increasing the
effectiveness of the public investment framework will help improve project execution, reduce
costs, boost domestic supply of social and economic goods, and sustain inclusive growth.
43.
The new ECF-supported program seeks to entrench macroeconomic stability,
address vulnerabilities, and create the conditions for sustained and inclusive growth. This
will require full ownership from the authorities to carry out a comprehensive reform agenda in a
steady fashion to correct the imbalances identified in the Article IV discussions and ensure timely
reimbursement of its obligations to the Fund. The new authorities are rightly focused on further
building capacity to implement such a program.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

25

CENTRAL AFRICAN REPUBLIC

44.
The ECF-supported program will aim at restoring fiscal sustainability while ramping
up poverty-reducing spending. In this context, staff welcomes the authorities’ decision to pass
a revised budget for 2016 to further enhance revenue mobilization and build buffers. The
domestic primary deficit of about less than 1 percent of GDP is in line with the return to fiscal
sustainability and its achievement is rightly encapsulated in a fiscal adjustment strategy that
covers both the revenue and the spending sides. At the same time, it provides for appropriate
fiscal buffers which will help the country weather volatile conditions.
45.
The structural reform agenda is targeted to unlock the growth potential of the key
sectors of the economy. Staff welcomes the launching of a mixed framework for improving the
business framework which bodes well for the design and prioritization of reforms. In this context,
the overhaul of the investment charter, combined with the reform of the mining code and the
forestry sector regulations, together with a streamlining of tax exemptions, are right steps to
boost activity in these key areas. Together with current efforts with support from the World Bank
and the African Development Bank to immediately increase the electricity supply will create the
conditions for a recovery in the agricultural sector, which is the centerpiece of the government
economic growth plan, but also a welcome improvement in the business climate. Lastly, staff is
encouraged by the measures envisaged by the new authorities to tackle the banking sector
weaknesses and enhance its contribution to economic growth.
46.
Staff sees merit in longer-term engagement with C.A.R. under the proposed ECF
arrangement and supports the authorities’ request for Fund assistance in an amount
equivalent to 75 percent of quota. The authorities consider the ECF arrangement as crucial to
breaking with past practices, rebuilding the country, and mobilizing much support from their
development partners. The ECF will also contribute to maintaining an appropriate level of
international reserves. The envisaged fiscal adjustment and the authorities’ determination bode
well for a restoration of CAR macroeconomic stability and addressing vulnerabilities.
47.
Support from the international community primarily in the form of grants is crucial.
With domestic resources expected to rise slowly and significant financing requirements to rebuild
the infrastructure and meet basic social needs, C.A.R. will continue to rely on substantial amounts
of external assistance. Against the back of a high level of debt distress, as highlighted by the
debt sustainability analysis and upcoming external obligations, including vis-ā-vis the Fund, staff
recommends that C.A.R. rely on grants and to a certain extent on concessional financing with a
grant element of at least 50 percent. While development partners played a key role during the
transition in providing extensive financial support and technical assistance, their continued
commitment in the months ahead during this post-emergency phase is more important than
ever, especially as the country embarks on a comprehensive reform program that could be
supported by an arrangement under the ECF. Staff encourages the new authorities to strengthen
their institutional framework to better coordinate such assistance, and welcomes their intention
to be included in the pilot CBF.
48.

Annex I. Central African Republic: External Stability Assessment
C.A.R.’s external position is weak according to the three “EBA-lite” approaches.1 The analysis of
broader non-price indicators also underscores significant competitiveness weaknesses. C.A.R.’s
exports base is very narrow, dominated by a few commodities (i.e., timber and diamond) and are
still subject to partial export ban. This highlights the urgent need for continued external support
while C.A.R. undertakes bold structural reforms to broaden the economic base and strengthen the
country’s resilience.

A.

Balance of Payment and Exchange Rate Developments

1.
C.A.R.’s external current account has deteriorated since the 2013 political and
security crisis. During 2004-2012, reflecting policies supported by the IMF in the context of the
ECF, the current account deficit was about 6.5 percent of GDP on average (Figure 1.). This deficit
widened in 2013 at the

Following the completion point of the HIPC debt relief in 2009, net income turned slight positive.

C.A.R.’s narrow exports base has been further squeezed by a decline in timber and
diamond exports. In 2012, timber and diamond accounted for about 75 percent of the country’s
total exports (Table 1). Timber exports

produced in the Central-Eastern region, which accounts for about half of the national diamond
output, remain under an export ban under the Kimberly process of certification.

The current account deficit is expected to narrow to about 10 percent of GDP
during 2016–20. The deficit of the goods and services balance is also expected to improve,
shrinking to 17.3 percent in 2016–20, down from a deficit of 22.3 percent of GDP in 2015,
assuming improved security conditions along the main Douala-Bangui corridor and the full lift of
the diamond export ban. The current account deficit would be primarily financed by external
grants.

C.A.R.’s real effective exchange
rate (REER) appreciated significantly
after 2013, despite a slight
depreciation of its nominal effective
exchange rate (NEER) (Figure 4).
Following a long period of stability, the
REER appreciated by almost 63 percent
from 2013 to 2015, mainly reflecting the
sharp increase in inflation observed
during the crisis and the transition
period.

Model-Based Real Exchange Rate Assessments

6.
The REER is assessed using the three EBA-lite approaches, namely, the current
account (CA), the real effective exchange rate index (IREER), and the external sustainability
(ES) approaches. Annual data for 150 countries for 1995–2015 are used, along with projections
for C.A.R. that reflect the macroeconomic framework. Both EBA include two regression-based
models of current account and real exchange rate and one external sustainability approach. EBA
makes a distinction between positive analysis of current account and real exchange rate and
normative assessments, and emphasizes the roles of policies and policy distortions. EBA models
include a broader set of fundamentals to have a better positive (descriptive) understanding of
current account and real exchange rate; and differentiate policy variables from non-policy
fundamentals to explicitly include policy gaps in normative assessments.
7.
Results from the CA approach suggest that the external position is substantially
weaker in 2015. The current account model is based on one panel regressions of current
account and provides estimated current account “norms,” which are values consistent with

A political crisis erupted in 2003 after after François Bozizé seized power. This quickly escalated into major fighting during 2004 which
continued through a peace agreement reached in 2007 Further negotiations resulted in an agreement in 2008 for reconciliation, a unity
government, and local elections in 2009 and parliamentary and presidential elections in 2010.

fundamentals and desirable policies. The estimated current account norm points to a deficit of
3.6 percent, while the underlying current account deficit is about 11.8 percent. Accordingly, and
depending on the current account elasticity we used (-0.1), the CA approach suggests that the
real exchange rate gap is 137.4 percent. The elasticity of current account (trade balance) to REER
is very small, suggesting that the impact of price factors may be small.

The IREER approach also suggests that the external position is substantially weaker
in 2015. The exchange rate model is based on one panel regressions of exchange rate and
provides estimated exchange rate “norms,” which are values consistent with fundamentals and
desirable policies. The REER is estimated to appreciate by 4.6 percent, while the underlying REER
appreciated by 5.1 percent (Figure 6). Therefore, in order to restore real exchange rate
equilibrium, the IREER approach suggests that the REER would need to depreciate by 47 percent.

Similarly, the ES approach also suggests that the external position is weaker in
2015. The external sustainability approach calculates a current account norm that would stabilize
the net foreign asset (NFA) position at some benchmark level. The current account stabilizing net
foreign assets represents a deficit of 1.5 percent of GDP, compared to a 6.6 percent underlying
current account deficit (Table 2). The ES approach therefore suggests that the REER gap is
19.9 percent for scenario 1, i.e., to stabilize net IIP at -4.8 percent of GDP. REER gap would be
1.9 percent for scenario 2, i.e., to stabilize net IIP at -60 percent of GDP. The ES results are based
on the key assumptions listed in the table. Elasticity of current account (trade balance) to REER is
only -0.26.

Taken together, the assessment of C.A.R’s REER indicates a substantially weaker
external position for C.A.R. Depending on the different approach used, the range of gap in the
REER is wide as it is between 19.9 to 147 percent in 2015. It is important to note, however, that
the above results reflect sensitivity to the macroeconomic assumptions on which the baseline
scenario is built upon, but also to the assumptions each approach uses, including the level of
elasticity of the current account to the real exchange rate. In addition, the political and security
situation in 2013 caused an important adverse shock to the economy with many ramifications to
the baseline macroeconomic assumptions.

C.

Assessment of Structural Competitiveness

11.
C.A.R.’s weak institutional indicators point to considerable weakness in structural
competitiveness. Competitiveness is defined as the set of institutions and factors that determine
the level of productivity of a country. C.A.R.’s low ranking suggests a weak structural
competitiveness and would imply a weak external position. The institutional indicators
considered in this section include: the Heritage Foundation indicators of economic freedom; the
World Bank’s Doing Business indicators; and the World Bank’s Country Policy and Institutional
Assessment (CPIA).
12.
According to the Heritage Foundation, C.A.R. continued to score at the lowest
quartile of the world in 2016. Overall, C.A.R.’s ranking slipped in the Foundation’s rankings
from 145th in 2012 to 168th, in 2016. C.A.R.’s total score index worsened from 50 in 2012
to 45.2 in 2016. At 45.2, C.A.R.’s index qualifies the economy as ”repressed” and is below the

average of SSA’s 120th rank and the West African Economic and Monetary Union’s (WAEMU)
117th rank, and the CEMAC’s 154th rank. In nine of the ten Heritage Foundation indicators of
economic freedom, C.A.R.’s scores are lower than the averages for SSA, WAEMU and CEMAC
(Figure 7). The only indicator for which C.A.R. score is ahead of the average for the SSA, WAEMU
and CEMAC is government spending.

C.A.R.’s business climate, as measured by the 2016 World Bank Doing Business
indicators, has always ranked among the bottom 10 countries in the world and
deteriorated further since 2012 (Table 3). Registering property and business dropped 35 and
29 places, respectively while getting credit dropped 35 places. On the positive side, regarding
trading across borders and resolving insolvency, C.A.R. moved up by 38 and 34 places in 2016,
respectively. Overall, C.A.R. ranked the bottom fifth country on ease of doing business indicator,
only ahead of Venezuela, South Sudan, Libya and Eritrea. Areas in need for most improvement
include: (i) starting a business; (ii) getting electricity; and (iii) paying taxes.

C.A.R.’s Country Policy and Institutional Assessment (CPIA) score in 2014 is below
the average of CEMAC, WAEMU and SSA in almost all aspects (Table 4). Of all the indicators,
C.A.R. was only slightly above the CEMAC average on transparency, accountability and corruption
in public sector but still below the average for WAEMU and SSA. Compared with 2012, most of
the indicators deteriorated. Areas that are lagging behind most are property rights and rulebased governance, business regulatory environment, equity of public resource use, social
protection and labor, policies and institutions for environment sustainability, and quality of
public administration.

Enhancing C.A.R. non-price competitiveness requires substantial structural reforms.
Based on the survey-based business and governance indicators reviewed above, priority
structural areas for improvement include: (i) the challenging business environment (especially the
business, regulatory, and trade environment in terms of starting a business, getting electricity
and paying taxes); and (ii) the institutional and governance environment (especially property
rights and rule-based governance, business regulatory environment, equity of public resource
use, social protection and labor, policies and institutions for environment sustainability, and
quality of public administration). Over time, such reforms would generate tangible productivity
gains, mainly by bolstering private sector investment and expansion as well as public sector
efficiency (including through more effective policy making and use of development assistance).
At the same time, C.A.R. has the urgent need for continued external support while it undertakes
the above structural reforms.

Appendix I. Letter of Intent

Madame Christine Lagarde
Managing Director
International Monetary Fund
700 19th Street, N.W.
Washington, D.C. 20431
USA

Bangui, July 7, 2016

Dear Madame Lagarde:
1.
The presidential and legislative elections took place in a peaceful environment and
resulted in the election of President Touadera, marking the end of the political transition
that began in the Central African Republic (C.A.R.) in January 2014. Our new government is
committed to promoting national reconciliation, demobilizing armed groups and reintegrating
them into economic and social life, and transforming the economy to create jobs for young
people and reduce poverty, which affects a large proportion of the population. To this end, we
intend to implement a macroeconomic and structural reform program with the help of our
development partners and the International Monetary Fund (IMF).
2.
The attached Memorandum of Economic and Financial Policies (MEFP) describes
the recent economic and financial developments and the structural reforms implemented
in 2015 and the first quarter of 2016 in the context of the third disbursement under the
Rapid Credit Facility. We would like to report that we have met the quantitative objectives that
we set at end-December 2015. Moreover, we have to some extent restored our administrative
capacity to define and implement medium-term economic and financial policies.
3.
This MEFP also presents the key aspects of our medium-term strategy. To achieve its
short- and medium-term growth and poverty reduction goals, the government of the C.A.R. is
seeking approval for a three-year arrangement (mid-2016 to mid-2019) under the Extended
Credit Facility (ECF) in an amount equivalent to SDR 83.55 million (or 75 percent of our quota).
The ECF-supported program is expected to provide a macroeconomic framework that will
strengthen substantially and in a sustainable manner the country’s balance of payments position
consistent with strong and durable poverty reduction and growth. The disbursements will be
contingent on the achievement of the performance criteria and structural benchmarks shown in
Tables 1 and 2 of the attached memorandum and the conclusion of program reviews, the first of
which will be based on the results through end-August 2016. The financial assistance under the
48

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

CENTRAL AFRICAN REPUBLIC

ECF will not only help to anchor the government’s macroeconomic policies but also serve to
mobilize other financial support from our development partners.
4.
We believe that the policies and measures set forth in the attached MEFP are
appropriate for attaining our program objectives and gradually reducing our balance of
payments financing needs going forward. We are prepared to take any additional measures
that may subsequently be required for that purpose. The government will consult with the Fund
on the adoption of such measures, and in advance of revisions to the policies contained in the
MEFP in accordance with Fund’s policies on such consultations. We will provide IMF staff with all
of the information indicated in the attached Technical Memorandum of Understanding (TMU)
regarding progress with the program supported by the ECF.
5.
We intend to publish the IMF staff report, including this letter and the attached
MEFP and TMU. We therefore authorize the IMF staff to post these documents on the IMF’s
external website once the Executive Board approves the new arrangement under the ECF.

Sincerely yours,
/s/

Attachment I. Memorandum of Economic and
Financial Policies for 2016–19
1.
This Memorandum of Economic and Financial Policies (MEFP) sets out the
economic and financial policies that the government of the Central African Republic
(C.A.R.) is implementing for the remainder of 2016 and plans to implement in the medium
term. These policies are in line with the country’s strategic priorities.

GENERAL CONTEXT
2.
The return to democratically elected institutions augurs well for the C.A.R.’s future.
The country is gradually emerging from the political and security crisis unleashed in 2013, which
led to a humanitarian crisis and the collapse of the economy. The support of the international
community has been key in helping the C.A.R. to recover. The new institutions that have resulted
from the democratic elections provide an opportunity to undertake an ambitious medium-term
reform program. Given the significant challenges facing us, our priorities for economic recovery
and poverty reduction will be to consolidate the security situation, promote national
reconciliation and social peace, build human and administrative capacities, and continue the
economic reforms. The latter will be based on: (i) fiscal consolidation, including strengthening tax
revenue collection and control of public expenditure while ensuring increased spending on the
priority sectors and restoring external sustainability; (ii) strengthening of the country’s
administrative capacities and the redeployment of the government through structural measures;
and (iii) improving the C.A.R.’s competitiveness.
3.
Security conditions are improving but remain volatile. With the support of
international forces, including MINUSCA and the French SANGARIS contingencies, the army and
the gendarmerie have restored security over much of the country, which facilitated the
organization of peaceful elections. However, the fact that ex-combatants have not yet been
demobilized and reintegrated, particularly in the diamond mining regions in the northeast, is a
source of risk and an obstacle to a strong economic recovery. In this context, work is underway
with participation of development partners, on a reform of the security sector. As part of this
work, key issues will be addressed, including the departure of many old and untrained officers,
the place of ex combatants in society, and the role and size of a new army, if any, including the
shift to a civil security format, with small specialized forces to ensure security.
4.
The C.A.R. is facing significant challenges and is caught in a fragility trap. During
each period of calm and return to peace, the country faces human and financial resource
constraints, with the result that achieving social cohesion and a national consensus around the
necessary reforms becomes difficult and excessively slow. In addition, security problems prevent
the redeployment of the government throughout the national territory, limiting the supply of
basic social services. Moreover, our country faces:

50

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

CENTRAL AFRICAN REPUBLIC



A slow economic recovery, with cumulative real growth of 5.8 percent in 2014–15, which is
quite insufficient to offset the 36.7 percent contraction in real GDP in 2013.



Heavy reliance on external aid. At end-2015, domestic revenues covered only 73 percent of
primary expenditure, making recourse to external assistance for the payment of wages and
pensions and debt service unavoidable.



Deeply rooted structural rigidities that are an obstacle to economic expansion and impede
private investment by local and foreign entrepreneurs. Some examples of these many
constraints are the lack of electricity, inadequate infrastructure, a weak education system, a
3 percent bank penetration rate, very high transportation costs and a chronic shortage of
means of telecommunications.



Weak human development, with severe consequences for extreme poverty in the various
segments of the population across the entire country.

RECENT ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS
5.

The data available at end-2015 indicate:



An estimated GDP growth of 4.8 percent supported by the recovery of agriculture,
construction, trade and services, despite a wave of violence during the third quarter.



A decline in average inflation at end-December to 4.5 percent, against 11.6 percent in 2014,
explained in part by better supply of goods owing to the security improvements of the
Douala-Bangui corridor, lower import prices for some staples, and improvements in the
distribution channels.



A decline in the primary deficit to 3 percent of GDP, reflecting an increase in domestic
revenues to 7.1 percent of GDP, explained by improvements in revenue collection, and better
control over primary expenditure, which remained largely unchanged at 10.1 percent of GDP.



A widening of the balance of payments current account deficit by 3.4 percentage points to
9 percent of GDP.



A high level of public debt, at 48.5 percent of GDP, as compared to 51 percent in 2014. The
Transition Government signed a new loan for CFAF 45 billion (5 percent of GDP) with Saudi
Arabia to launch infrastructure and social sector investment projects. The borrowing
conditions are concessional, with a grant element of 49 percent.

6.
The disbursement of budgetary support in 2015 was in line with projections, with
the exception of CFAF 5 billion carried forward to 2016. These resources, combined with
control over non-priority spending and a slowing of domestically financed capital expenditure,

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

51

CENTRAL AFRICAN REPUBLIC

enabled the Transition Government to pay wages, service the debt, clear CFAF 10.1 billion in
arrears, and build up CFAF 10 billion (1 percent of GDP) in financial reserves.
7.
To improve public finance management and the mobilization of domestic revenues,
the Transition Government has implemented significant reforms during its emergency
economic program supported by disbursements under the RCF.


Increased tax and customs controls, including for the VAT on oil products, and better
tracking of exemptions have led to a significant improvement in revenues. However, some
measures envisaged in 2015 in the context of the third disbursement under the Rapid Credit
Facility have not yet been implemented, in particular: (i) the adoption of the decree for the
revision of the oil price structure in order to base it on Platts international prices; (ii) the
reduction in exemptions on telephone user fees, particularly those granted to employees of
the United Nations agencies, the Agency for Air Navigation Safety in Africa and Madagascar
(ASECNA), the BEAC, and diplomatic missions; (iii) the revision of reference prices in the
forestry sector to reflect international prices and ensure adequate valuation of commercial
transactions; (iv) improvements in the collection of the logging and reforestation taxes;
(v) overhaul of taxation of the diamond mining sector, better control over the distribution
system, reduction of fraud, and improvement of the certification process; and (vi) revision of
the banking agreements to ensure better revenue collection by the government, end
automated debiting and the offsetting of claims (under penalty of sanctions), and enable
daily transfers to the Treasury.



On the expenditure side, the following measures were taken: (i) the first phase of the civil
service reform has been completed with assistance from the World Bank and the UNDP and
allowed to streamline the civil service, gendarmerie and police roster. However, despite a
significant reduction in the number of civil servants included on the roster, the expected
financial gains did not fully materialize owing to delays in the implementation of some
measures (repatriation of diplomats at the end of their missions), the appointment of more
diplomatic personnel than necessary, excessive employment of ineligible civil servants with
special status, and the reintegration by a court decision of civil servants who had been
removed from the roster; (ii) the operationalization of the Central Treasury Agency (ACCT), a
fundamental step in the fiscal reform toward greater transparency in public finance
management; (iii) the interconnection of the GESCO-budget and GESCO-accounting
modules, which made it possible to establish the conditions for restoring the expenditure
cycle, although the connection between the budget and accounting modules remains
problematic, limiting the scope of this measure; and (iv) the adoption of regulatory
provisions to strictly limit recourse to exceptional procedures to a maximum of 5 percent of
expenditure (excluding wages and pensions and debt service) and the execution only of
expenditures included in the budget are an initial step toward better alignment of budget
execution with the budget adopted by the National Assembly.

8.
The banking sector is playing a limited role in the economic recovery. The expansion
of bank credit to the private sector remains hampered by a number of constraints related to the
security volatility, the lack of appropriate guarantee instruments, the lack of long-term resources,
information asymmetry and a judicial system that does not facilitate debt collection. Banks are
finding it difficult to extend credit beyond a limited group of customers with adequate
accounting practices.
9.
Financial sector indicators show an increase in the overall liquidity of the banks in
2015 and a decline in asset quality. Almost one third of the loans are nonperforming, primarily
owing to the sizable stock of government arrears to banks and to domestic suppliers, who in turn
cannot repay debts contracted with the commercial banks. Banks have increased their loan loss
provisioning to almost 70 percent (compared with50 percent in March 2015), leading to a
reduction in their capital and profitability.

MACROECONOMIC OBJECTIVES AND
MEDIUM-TERM POLICIES
10.
Given these significant economic challenges and the population’s high hopes, in the
context of a gradual emergence from fragility, our strategic priorities for economic
recovery and a substantial reduction in poverty are to: (i) restore fiscal and external debt
sustainability; (ii) improve competitiveness and expand the base of economic activity to create
the conditions for sustainable and inclusive growth; (iii) lay the foundation for good governance;
and (iv) enhance the institutional framework and administrative capacity. For this purpose, we
request the support of the IMF in the form of a new arrangement under the Extended Credit
Facility (ECF). The ECF-supported program will provide a macroeconomic framework that will
strengthen substantially and in a sustainable manner our balance of payments position consistent
with strong and durable poverty reduction and growth.

A.

Macroeconomic framework for 2016–2019

11.
The medium-term outlook should improve as the security situation is restored, the
embargo on diamond exports is gradually lifted, and adequate macroeconomic policies are
introduced. Against the back of a comprehensive reform of the security sector that will create
the conditions for an economic recovery, the main macroeconomic objectives are:


Projected economic real growth of 5.2 percent in 2016, driven by recovery across all sectors,
and the resumption of public and private investment in infrastructure and social sectors.
Average inflation will be contained to 4 percent based on the solid performance of the food
crop sector, continued improvement of the distribution channels, and the expected decline in
the prices of oil products at the pump. During the period 2016–19, economic growth is
projected to average 5.5 percent, with inflation in line with the CAEMC target of 3 percent by
2018 owing in part to an increase in agricultural output.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

53

CENTRAL AFRICAN REPUBLIC



An external current account deficit of 11.1 percent of GDP in 2016, up from 9 percent of GDP
in 2015, reflecting a slower uptick in exports and a reduction in transfers. The financing of the
current account will decline in comparison with 2015 owing to an increase in debt
repayments. During the period 2016–19, the current account deficit is projected to be at
around 9.7 percent of GDP given the sizable reconstruction needs. Financing needs are
projected to decline during the period from 4.8 percent of GDP in 2016 to 3.2 percent in
2019.



The domestic primary deficit, which will be the anchor for the fiscal policy, should decline
from 3.3 percent of GDP in 2016 to 0.9 percent of GDP in 2019, making it possible to reduce
the public debt to 31.2 percent of GDP in 2019. The new target for 2016 will be included in a
revised budget for 2016 that the new authorities plan to adopt by end-August. The
achievement of this objective involves an increase in revenues, which is projected at
8.1 percent of GDP, or 1 percentage point more than in 2015.1 Public spending is expected to
increase by 2.2 percentage points of GDP owing to an increase in capital and social spending
and despite a reduction in the wage bill from 6 percent of GDP in 2015 to 5.3 percent of GDP
in 2016.



The financing gap will essentially be covered by external sources, particularly in the form of
budgetary assistance from the EU, the World Bank, France and the African Development Bank
totaling CFAF 50 billion.2



This ECF-supported program takes into account factors or changes that are outside the
government’s influence. Therefore, various quantitative targets will be adjusted for shortfalls
in privatization and renewal of telecommunications licenses or forestry fees. This will ensure
that the fiscal and debt sustainability objectives are met in the event of a change in the
expected external financing.

B.

Economic and financial policies for 2016–19

12.
We commit to conduct a sustainable fiscal policy while accumulating buffers to
protect us against potential shocks. It is essential that we restore the macroeconomic stability
that will lead to economic recovery by releasing financial resources for the private sector and at
the same time allocating more resources to the priority social sectors and to the restoration of a
lasting peace. The country is vulnerable to a number of shocks, including possible delays in the
disbursement of external assistance and an increase in international oil prices, which make it
necessary to accumulate reserves in the form of government deposits with the banking sector as
The reforms envisaged in the context of the initial budget for 2016 included: (i) extending the tax base for income tax;
(ii) increasing the VAT rate to 5 percent for previously exempted staples; (iii) modifying the payment procedures for the
property tax through an auto-filled return; (iv) strengthening tax and customs controls, including on oil, mining, and forestry
activities; (v) improving VAT collection: (vi) introducing special taxes on tobaccos and transport activities: (vii) implementing an
integrated computerized system connecting the customs offices in Doula and Bangui; and (viii) strengthening controls on tax
and customs exemptions.

In this context, we will use the exceptional advance from BEAC (CFAF 9.24 billion) only as a bridge loan to offset delays in
disbursement of budget support. Also, the Saudi loan will be used to finance social projects. It will not fill a residual financing
gap.

54

an insurance against such risks. Notwithstanding this safeguard mechanism, we are prepared to
take additional measures (on the revenue and expenditure sides) in the event of shocks and
insufficient levels of reserves.
13.
The revised budget for 2016 is in line with the medium-term strategy of restoring
fiscal sustainability. Consequently, the domestic primary deficit is projected at 3.3 percent of
GDP. We will adopt a supplementary budget (structural benchmark for endAugust 2016), which will contain a series of additional measures to increase revenues by the
equivalent of 0.2 percent of GDP and accumulate government deposits equivalent to 0.5 percent
of GDP. The latter should reach 1.5 percent of GDP by 2019. These measures include: (i) a new
price structure for oil products based on Platts international prices (structural benchmark for
end-July 2016),3 yielding CFAF 1.5 billion over the last three months of 2016; (ii) transition to a
list of reference prices for exported forest species based on global price trends and enhanced
control over transportation cost structures to ensure adequate domestic valuation and effective
collection of taxes and concession fees (expected to yield CFAF0.3 billion); and (iii) strict
application of the banking agreement on revenue collection to ensure traceability, with an
absolute prohibition on automated debiting and offsetting and the requirement for immediate
payment into the government’s current account with the central bank (CFAF 0.4 billion).
14.
The prices of petroleum products will be regularly revised to safeguard the revenue
objectives. January 1, 2017, we will implement a pass-through policy of international prices to
domestic prices at the pump in order to safeguard projected fiscal revenues. Moreover, we plan
to request technical assistance to continue the work on simplifying this new price structure,
including eliminating the many earmarked revenues. This policy will be accompanied by social
programs under preparation to protect the vulnerable segments of the population, including
subsidized prices for households using cooking and heating oil, and vouchers for transportation
for workers earning small wages.
15.
Total spending should be kept below a ceiling of 17.1 percent of GDP. In this
context, the wage bill is projected to be at 5.3 of GDP, or 0.7 percentage point lower than in
2015. For 2016, the cost of new recruitments in the social and priority sectors (CFAF 1.2 billion) is
expected to be offset by the gains achieved through the ongoing cleaning up of the roster
(CFAF roster (CFAF 100 million) the timely retirement of eligible civil servants (CFAF 150 million),
the gradual elimination of non-regular civil servants (CFAF 150 million), and the repatriation of
diplomats whose missions are ending in 2016 (CFAF 60 million) through the provision of airline
tickets (structural benchmark for end-December 2016). These net gains, combined with
improvements in revenue collection, will make it possible to increase priority spending on goods
and services, transfers and subsidies (to 4.7 percent of GDP) and domestically-financed capital
spending (to 1.8 percent of GDP). The revised budget slightly increases the settlement of

agriculture and petrochemicals).

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

55

CENTRAL AFRICAN REPUBLIC

domestic payments arrears (0.5 percent of GDP), the financing of which will be covered by the
additional revenues generated by the new measures.
16.
To manage the government’s cash flow and make it more secure and to gradually
expand the scope of the Treasury, we will continue to implement strict cash flow
management in order to align available resources with priority spending, ensure sound
execution of the cash flow management plan, and avoid the accumulation of payments arrears.
In this context, we have prepared a monthly cash flow plan for 2016 and 2017 to reflect the
domestic primary balance objective. Its implementation will be tracked by the Treasury
Committee, which will continue to meet monthly under the chairmanship of the Minister of
Finance and Budget.
17.
We will continue to improve revenue mobilization in the medium term. With fiscal
revenues standing at just 7.1 percent of GDP in 2015, we are aware that the public finance
situation is not sustainable since revenues remain insufficient to cover our primary spending and
debt service needs. The government will therefore implement the measures included in the
action plan that was prepared in early 2016 with the help of the IMF and validated by the
government, with the aim of increasing domestic revenues to 8.1 percent of GDP in 2016 and
10.1 percent of GDP in 2019. These reforms focus on:


Expansion of the tax base and simplification of procedures. The measures will focus on
better management of the VAT, prohibition on offsetting unpaid VAT credits against other
taxes owing, an improvement in the bases for the valuation of exports, a strengthening of
controls and monitoring, particularly of the wood and diamond sectors, simplification of
procedures and a reduction in para-fiscal levies.



Improvement of tax and customs administration. In this area, the key elements of the
reform will focus on the introduction of the auto-filled return for the property tax, the
revision of agreements that include tax concessions, the harmonization of the General Tax
Code through the implementation of the CAEMC directives on the VAT and excise duties,
stricter monitoring of the IGU, enhanced management of the tax operations of large
taxpayers, the introduction of corporate citizen status, the collection of arrears, and closer
relations between taxpayers and the government. In addition to these efforts, we will begin
integrated computerization of the customs and tax networks, beginning with the Beloko
customs bureau and establish the IT connection between the Douala and Bangui offices.



Streamlining and better management of exemptions. This involves strict application of
the laws and regulations in effect, the establishment of criteria for the granting of
exemptions, and a review of all existing agreements.

18.
There are numerous challenges associated with improving public finance
management. We are committed to: (i) fiscal discipline; (ii) the restoration and normalization of
the expenditure cycle; (iii) continued efforts to control the wage bill; and (iv) the implementation

56

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

CENTRAL AFRICAN REPUBLIC

of the accounting function. The government plans to improve fiscal governance through a return
to normal budgetary procedures. To respond to these challenges, the government has begun
implementing the action plan that was prepared in early 2016 with the help of the IMF and
validated by the government to re-launch the public finance management system and establish
the bases for a simple robust management of the government’s resources and loans. In this
context, preparatory measures have been taken, including assumption of commitments in the
2016 budget, restoration of the interconnections in the integrated budget and accounting
management system (GESCO), and development of the draft nomenclature for the supporting
documentation governing interactions between the payment authorization officers and the
accountants, which has been submitted to the Minister of Finance and Budget for validation.
19.
The government intends to continue and accelerate the implementation of this
plan with technical assistance from the IMF and other partners. The plan includes several
measures, some of which are very short term, to improve and modernize public finance
management. The measures, covering the period 2016-18, are organized around four priority
objectives: (i) to manage the government’s cash flow and safeguard it so as to gradually extend
the scope of the Treasury; (ii) to restore and normalize budgetary management in order to
gradually decrease the use of exceptional spending procedures to 5 percent of expenditures;
(iii) to restore the accuracy of the entire general budget and the specific budgets; and (iv) to
restore the credibility of the government by combating fraud and restoring creditor confidence.
More specifically, these measures are as follows:


Implement the medium-term action plans on revenue during 2016-2018;



Strengthen revenue administration and tax policy during 2016-2018 with support from the
Fund;



Improve treasury management in 2016 through the strengthening of the central accounting
and treasury agency in 2016;



Extend the scope of the Treasury to strengthen the treasury single account while preserving
the stability of the banking system during 2016;



Improve the execution of the treasury plan to cover priority funding and avoid accumulation
of new arrears during 2016;



Implement normal budget procedures in 2016;



Take the administrative steps to ensure that the 2017 budget is prepared in a timely fashion
in 2016;



Adhere to the 5 percent limit regarding exceptional spending;

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

57

CENTRAL AFRICAN REPUBLIC



Complete during the current year the 2015 accounts and regularize the 2016 accounting
operations conducted so far;



Extend the accounting operations to produce in 2017 a central government balance for the
general budget for 2017 and budget annexes in 2018;



Enhance throughout the program period government transparency and ensure that the
“comité des sages” acts in lieu of the national committee against corruption which is inactive;



Strengthen budget control institutions starting in 2016 through measures to improve the
efficiency of the unit in charge of finance inspection;



Reform before the end of the program the legal framework to fight against corruption

20.

The following are the main actions in this program of action:



To restore accounting accuracy, the government plans to complete the posting of
accounting entries under way in the GESCO system for purposes of producing the 2015
financial statements, as well as the entries for the first four months of 2016, by July 31, 2016.
The government commits to systematically post entries starting on June 1, 2016. As of this
date, the GESCO account balances and the trial balances will be produced every month and
shared with the IMF staff. The government intends to adopt the nomenclature for the
supporting documentation and the procedures manual for revenue and expenditure
execution by July 15, 2016.



In the medium term, the government plans to: (i) improve cash flow management and
make it more secure by expanding its coverage to include all government operations and
bank accounts in commercial banks; (ii) restore the expenditure cycle; (iii) respect the strict
limits on recourse to exceptional procedures (budgetary payment orders and cash payment
orders) to a maximum of 5 percent of total expenditure excluding wages and debt service;
and (iv) restore normal budget expenditure procedures (commitment / validation / payment
authorization / payment).



Upon completion of the comprehensive survey (under way) of government accounts opened
with commercial banks, we plan to adopt a ministerial decision identifying all government
accounts and their contents (structural benchmark for end-August 2016) as it will facilitate
the establishment of a consolidated Single Treasury Account. This involves a restructuring of
the government’s bank accounts. Opening of new government bank accounts will therefore
be suspended, with the exception of project accounts (structural benchmark for
end-July 2016). We also plan to close all government bank accounts with the commercial
banks that are managed outside the government’s centralized cash flow management
system, with the exception of project accounts (structural benchmark for end-March 2017).
In the medium term, after an impact study on the transfer of the main government accounts

58

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

CENTRAL AFRICAN REPUBLIC

opened with the commercial banks, we plan to gradually continue the consolidation of these
accounts in the Single Treasury Account at the central bank.


C.

The ACCT will undertake an information campaign to explain this reform to government
accountants and payment authorization officers. It will produce a monthly report on all
identified breaches of the prohibition on automated debiting by banks from the revenue
accounts. Moreover, it will have guaranteed access to information and statements on all
Treasury accounts with the commercial banks.

Management of Domestic Payments Arrears

21.
The clearance of domestic payments arrears is key to our fiscal consolidation
program and the restoration of creditor confidence. The outstanding stock at end-May 2016
is CFAF 157 billion. It comprises: (i) arrears to the BEAC for an amount of CFAF 22.4 billion
following the April 2016 agreement on the consolidation of liabilities and unpaid loans and
arrears; (ii) claims of commercial banks on the government (estimated at CFAF 2.6 billion). The
audit of these claims is under way (financed by the European Union) and will make it possible to
establish a strategy for clearing those arrears starting in 2017. In cooperation with IMF staff, we
plan to explore the possibility of securitization of these bank claims. The other components of
the domestic arrears include commercial, social and cross-debts for a cumulative amount of
CFAF 132 billion. We also plan to complete the audit of these debts by end-June 2017. Once
these audits have been completed and the claims validated, we will define transparent criteria
and terms and conditions for their clearance. We will adopt a plan for the settlement of validated
domestic payments arrears by July 2017 at the latest (structural benchmark for
end-June 2017). We also plan to review the VAT credits in order to prepare a payment plan and
eliminate all recourse to offsetting. In the immediate future, priority will be given to commercial
and wage and pension arrears dating back to 2013–14 (amounting to CFAF 13.2 billion),4 and
which will be cleared in 2016 and 2017, respectively.

D.

External Debt management and Sustainability

22.
We will consolidate debt management. The external debt sustainability analysis
classifies C.A.R. as a country at high risk of debt distress. This classification is based on the
collapse of GDP, tax revenues and exports and, to a lesser extent, on the increase in external
borrowing. Furthermore, as a result of the crisis, we have accumulated external payment arrears
vis-a-vis bilateral non Paris Club creditors in the context of the 2009 non-representative Paris
Club agreement. At end-May 2016, C.A.R. owes US$ 100.9 million to Argentina, Equatorial
Guinea, India, Iraq, Libya, and Montenegro. We also accumulated in arrears vis-a-vis some French
private entities and we are continuing to make good faith efforts to reach a collaborative
agreement with them. Moreover, the accumulation of domestic payments arrears has
contributed to a rise in the level of domestic debt. Given this situation, the government will seek
Salary arrears include the months of November and December 2013. Pension arrears cover the second and third quarters of
2015.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

59

CENTRAL AFRICAN REPUBLIC

to mobilize financing primarily in the form of grants and, in consultation with Fund staff, new
highly concessional loans with a grant element of 50 percent.
23.
We will continue our efforts to improve public debt management. We will install a
new debt management and analysis software, SYGADE 6.0. We will also be stricter in ensuring
that all new financing results exclusively from a decision of the Minister of Finance. This provision
will be included in the supplementary budget for 2016.

E.

Banking and Financial Sector Reforms

24.
The banking sector should better contribute to the economic recovery through
increased financial intermediation. We will aim to reduce the banking system weaknesses so
that it plays its proper role in supporting economic growth. On the basis of the
recommendations of a seminar organized in June 2015, the National Credit Council approved a
series of measures in March 2016 that intend to remedy the weaknesses of the banking sector.
Based on these recommendations, we will: (i) explain the government’s medium-term strategy to
enhance the country’s economic profile, which will help economic agents; (ii) organize training
seminars to increase banks’, businesses’ and the general public’s knowledge of the financial
sector, including the various savings, credit and micro financing instruments; (iii) protect the
integrity of the banking system and monitor risk management and lending practices in order to
deal with potential risks; in this context, we will ask COBAC to send a banking supervision mission
given that the most recent mission dates back to 2012; (iv) create an action plan for the
establishment of commercial and property registries; and (v) authorize more banks to engage in
mobile banking activities. To improve credit supply, in accordance with community procedures,
actions will focus on examining ways to establish a credit bureau to reduce the information
asymmetry and support small and medium-sized enterprises and commercial banks. The
authorities are requesting technical assistance in this area. Finally, with the help of donors, we will
examine the conditions for and feasibility of creating a Guarantee Fund to encourage the
financing of small and medium-sized enterprises.

F.

Development Strategy and Structural Reforms

25.
The C.A.R.’s main challenge is to create the conditions for sustainable and inclusive
growth in order to reduce poverty. This challenge first involves restoring peace and security
throughout the national territory, and then creating the environment necessary for expanding
the private sector, particularly in agriculture, which will be the cornerstone of our recovery
strategy. To this end, we must overcome the major constraints related to the shortage of energy
and basic infrastructure, the high cost of transportation owing to the C.A.R.’s landlocked status,
and the limited access to credit. Overall, our medium-term strategy focuses on the following
activity sectors:


Developing food, cash and export crops.



Promoting agro-forestry and downstream operations to create value added and jobs.

60

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

CENTRAL AFRICAN REPUBLIC



Developing mining activities in a formalized context to make these activities more attractive
to large operators.



Repairing and restoring highways, rural roads, dry ports and provincial airports.



Expanding transportation and telecommunications infrastructure.



Developing energy capacities.

26.
We will undertake structural and institutional reforms to promote the development
of the private sector. These reforms, which are aimed at improving the business climate, will
focus on the modernizing and updating the legal framework in key economic sectors. To this
end, the government intends to implement the Joint Business Improvement Framework (CMAA)
to promote and enhance the government-private sector dialogue. Two laws are in preparation to
revitalize telecommunications activities. In the same spirit, we will update the investment charter,
the mining code, the telecommunications code and the regulations in effect in the forestry
sector. A one-stop shop will be established to facilitate administrative procedures for investors.
27.
We are determined to enhance good governance and to ensure better use of public
resources. In this context, the government will strictly apply the law requiring any individual
appointed to the position of minister to submit an asset disclosure within 60 days of taking office
(structural benchmark for end-July 2016). The government will consider extending the asset
disclosure to the immediate family members, however this will require legislative changes.
Moreover, we intend to create a special commission (comité des sages) to establish the
conditions for the implementation of a coherent anticorruption framework in line with existing
international practices.

G.

Social Policy

28.
Our social policy is aimed at enhancing the resilience of the population. It is based
on an improvement in civil protection, the restoration and reorganization of the
government throughout the national territory and the re-launching of activities in the
essential social sectors. Specific objective of this policy are:


Assistance to internally displaced persons and refugees to ensure the effective resumption of
socioeconomic activities throughout the national territory.



The restoration of social cohesion and reduction of tensions in the community to support the
local economic recovery and the creation of temporary jobs, primarily for young people.



The reorganization and redeployment of the government throughout the national territory to
support the economic recovery.



Access to safe drinking water, sanitation and hygiene.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

61

CENTRAL AFRICAN REPUBLIC



The rehabilitation of the education sector to ensure full education coverage and complete
high-quality education, including access to all levels for all children of both genders,
regardless of where they live.



New impetus to the health care system, including the strengthening of the fight against
HIV/AIDS.

29.
The international partners have an important role to play in the achievement of our
economic recovery and development strategy. The institutional framework in place implies full
participation of the donors. We plan to continue coordination in this context to strengthen
ownership of our program and improve financial governance.

CAPACITY BUILDING AND TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE
30.
Technical assistance (TA) and training will be vital in the coming years to build our
institutional capacities. To ensure the successful implementation of the program, we would like
to receive technical assistance that focuses on the collection of domestic revenues (VAT,
management of exemptions, better performance of the tax and customs administration, reform
of taxation in the key sectors of forestry, mining and telecommunications), improved cash flow
management and enhancement of the operation of the public finance management system
(manage the government’s cash flow and make it more secure, restore and normalize fiscal
management, restore accounting accuracy and the government’s credit), improve public debt
management, produce macroeconomic statistics, reform the civil service by means of qualitative
management of staff, and rebuild administrative and macro-fiscal capacities. To implement this
TA, we plan to conclude a memorandum of understanding with the IMF with a view to involving
the IMF’s pilot Capacity Development Framework. 5In this context, we commit to improve
capacity and make the best use of the TA that will be provided by development partners and the
Fund. We are also committing to train staff in place and hire young qualified staff if possible.

PROGRAM MONITORING
31.
Performance under the program will be monitored using quantitative performance
indicators, indicative benchmarks and structural benchmarks. Performance criteria have been
established for end-August 2016, end-December 2016 and end-June 2017, along with structural
benchmarks for end-March 2017 (Table 1). The structural benchmarks are described in Table 2.
The first program review will be completed by end-November 2016 and will cover the results
through end-August 2016. The second program review should be concluded by March 2017 and
cover the results through end-December 2016.
32.
Program execution will be subject to regular monitoring. At the political level, the
program will be monitored by the staff of the Office of the President of the Republic, the Prime
Minister, the Ministry of Finance and Budget, and the BEAC. Technically, the program will be
5

The MoU will be signed once the details of the IMF pilot project are finalized.

62

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

CENTRAL AFRICAN REPUBLIC

implemented by the Economic Reform Monitoring Committee (CS-REF), a unit under the
authority of the Minister of Finance and Budget that includes representatives of the various
ministries involved in economic and financial affairs.
33.
Throughout the duration of the program, the government commits to not
introduce or intensify restrictions on payments and transfers related to current
international transactions, nor to introduce multiple exchange rate practices, engage in
bilateral agreements not consistent with the Article VIII of the Articles of Agreement,
impose or broaden imports restrictions to influence the balance of payments. In addition,
the government commits to adopt, in consultation with Fund staff, any new measures, financial
or structural, that may prove necessary to ensure the success of the program.

Attachment II.
2016 Technical Memorandum of Understanding
INTRODUCTION
1.
This Technical Memorandum of Understanding (TMU) spells out the concepts,
definitions, and data reporting procedures mentioned in the Memorandum of Economic
and Financial Policies (MEFP) prepared by the authorities of the Central African Republic. More,
specifically, it describes:


data reporting periodicity and timeframes;



definitions and computation methods;



quantitative targets;



adjusters of quantitative targets;



structural benchmarks; and



other commitments made within the MEFP.

2.
Unless otherwise specified, all performance criteria and indicative targets are assessed
on a cumulative basis as of January 1 of the same year.

Program Assumptions
3.
Exchange rate. For the purposes of this TMU, the value of transactions denominated in
foreign currencies will be converted into CFA francs (CFAF), the currency of the Central African
Republic (C.A.R.), on the basis of the exchange rates used to prepare the ECF. The key exchange
rates are shown below.
CFAF/US$: 585
CFAF/euro: 656
CFAF/SDR: 815

Definitions
4.
Unless otherwise specified, the government is understood to mean the central
government of C.A.R. and does not include any local governments, the central bank, or any
public entity with separate legal personality (i.e., enterprises wholly or partially owned by the
government) that are not included in the table on government financial operations (Tableau des
opérations financières de l’État—TOFE).

66

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

CENTRAL AFRICAN REPUBLIC

5.
Definition of debt. The definition of debt is set out in point 8 of Decision
No. 6230-(79/140) of the Executive Board of the IMF, as amended on December 5, 2014, by
Executive Board Decision No. 15688-(14/107):
(a) “Debt” is understood to mean a current, i.e., not contingent, liability, created under a
contractual arrangement through the provision of value in the form of assets (including currency)
or services, and which requires the obligor to make one or more payments in the form of assets
(including currency) or services, according to a specific schedule; these payments will discharge
the obligor of the principal and/or interest liabilities incurred under the contract. Debts can take
a number of forms, the primary ones being as follows:
i.
loans, i.e., advances of money to the obligor by the lender made on the basis of an
undertaking that the obligor will repay the funds in the future (including deposits, bonds,
debentures, commercial loans, and buyers’ credits) and temporary exchanges of assets that are
equivalent to fully collateralized loans, under which the obligor is required to repay the funds,
and usually pay interest, by repurchasing the collateral from the buyer in the future (such as
repurchase agreements and official swap arrangements);
ii. suppliers’ credits, i.e., contracts where the supplier permits the obligor to defer payments
until sometime after the date on which the goods are delivered or services are provided; and
iii. leases, i.e., arrangements under which property is provided that the lessee has the right to
use for one or more specified period(s) of time that are usually shorter than the total expected
service life of the property, while the lessor retains the title to the property. For the purpose of
this guideline, the debt is the present value (at the inception of the lease) of all lease payments
expected to be made during the period of the agreement, excluding those payments necessary
for the operation, repair, or maintenance of the property.
(b) Under the definition of debt set out above, arrears, penalties, and judicially awarded
damages arising from the failure to make payment under a contractual obligation that
constitutes debt are debt. Failure to make payment on an obligation that is not considered debt
under this definition (e.g., payment on delivery) will not give rise to debt.
(c) External debt is defined as debt borrowed or serviced in a currency other than the
CFA franc of the Financial Cooperation of Africa (CFAF).
(d) Internal debt is defined as debt borrowed or serviced in the CFA franc of the Financial
Cooperation of Africa (CFAF).
6.
Guaranteed debt. The guaranteeing of a debt by the government is understood to be
an explicit legal obligation to service a debt in the event of nonpayment by the borrower (by
means of settlements in cash or in kind).
7.
Concessional debt. A debt is considered concessional if its grant element is at least
50 percent. The grant element is the difference between the nominal value of the loan and its
present value, expressed as a percentage of the nominal value. The present value of the debt at

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

67

CENTRAL AFRICAN REPUBLIC

the date on which it is contracted is calculated by discounting the debt service payments at the
time of the contracting of the debt. The discount rate used for this purpose is 5 percent.
8.
Total government revenue is tax and non-tax revenue or other revenue (as defined in
GFSM 2001, Chapter 5) and is recorded on a cash basis. Proceeds from taxation on contracts,
asset sales, revenue from privatization or from the granting or renewal of licenses, and
placement proceeds on government assets and grants are not considered government revenue
for the purposes of the program.
9.
Total government expenditure is understood to be the sum of expenditure on wages
and salaries of government employees, goods and services, transfers (including subsidies, grants,
social benefits, and other expenses), interest payments, and capital expenditure. All these
categories are recorded on a commitment basis, unless otherwise stated. Total government
expenditure also includes expenditure executed before payment authorization (dépenses avant
ordonnancement—DAO) and not yet regularized.
10.
Wages and salaries correspond to the compensation of government employees as
described in paragraphs 6.8–6.18 of GFSM 2001, namely, all employees (permanent and
temporary), including civil servants and members of the armed and security forces.
Compensation is defined as the sum of wages and salaries, allowances, bonuses, pension fund
contributions on behalf of civil servants, and any other form of monetary or non-monetary
payment.
11.
For the purposes of this memorandum, the term arrears is defined as any debt
obligations (as defined in paragraph 5 above) that have not been amortized in conformity with
the conditions specified in the pertinent contract establishing them.
12.
Domestic payment arrears are the sum of: (i) payment arrears on expenditure; and
(ii) payment arrears on domestic debt.


68

Payment arrears on expenditures are defined as all payment orders to the Treasury created
by the entity responsible for authorizing expenditure payments but not yet paid 90 days after
authorization to pay given by the treasury. Expenditure payment arrears so defined are part
of “balance payable” (or “amounts due”). Balance payable corresponds to government
unpaid financial obligations and include the domestic floating debt besides the expenditure
arrears. They are defined as expenditure incurred, validated and certified by the financial
controller and authorized by the public Treasury but which have not been paid yet. These
obligations include bills payable but not paid to public and private companies, but do not
include domestic debt financing (principal plus interest). For the program target, domestic
payment arrears are “balances payable” whose maturity goes beyond the 90-day regulatory
deadline, while floating debt represents “balances payable” whose maturity does not go
beyond the 90-day deadline.



Payment arrears on domestic debt are defined as the difference between the amount
required to be paid under the contract or legal document and the amount actually paid after
the payment deadline specified in the pertinent contract;

13.
External payment arrears are defined as the difference between the amount required to
be paid under the contract or legal document and the amount actually paid after the payment
deadline specified in the pertinent contract.

Quantitative Targets
14.
The quantitative targets (QTs) listed below are those specified in Table 1 of the
MEFP. Adjusters of the quantitative targets are specified in Section D.


Ceiling on domestic budgetary financing to the government.



Domestic public financing to the government is defined as the sum of the i) the bank
credit to the government , defined below; and ii) non-bank financing to the government,
including proceeds from the sale of government assets, which includes proceeds from the
divestiture of parts of public enterprises, that is, privatizations, Treasury bills, and other
securitized obligations issued by the government and denominated in CFA francs on the
CEMAC regional financial market, and any Bank of Central African States (BEAC) credit to the
government, including any drawings on the CFA franc counterpart of the allocation of Special
Drawing Rights (SDRs).



Bank credit to the government is defined as the balance between the debts and claims of
the government vis-à-vis the central bank and the national commercial banks. The scope of
credit to the government is that used by the BEAC and is in keeping with general IMF
practice in this area. It implies a definition of government that is broader than the one
indicated in paragraph 3. Government claims include the CFA franc cash balance, [postal
checking accounts], subordinated debt (obligations cautionnées), and all deposits with the
BEAC and commercial banks of government owned entities, with the exception of industrial
or commercial public agencies (établissements publics à caractère industriel et
commercial—EPICs) and government corporations, which are excluded from the calculation.
Government debt to the banking system includes all debt to the central bank and the
national commercial banks, including Treasury bills and other securitized debt.

Floor for total domestic government revenue.


Domestic government revenue: only cash revenues (tax and non-tax revenue) will be taken
into account for the TOFE.

Floor for government social spending.


Poverty-reducing social spending comprises public non-wage spending on primary and
secondary education, health, social action, water and sanitation, microfinance, agriculture,

sustainability analysis prepared jointly by the staff of the World Bank and the IMF.

Non-Accumulation of New External Payment Arrears by the Government.


External payment arrears are defined in paragraph 12.



The government undertakes not to accumulate external payment arrears, with the
exception of arrears relating to debt that is the subject of renegotiation or rescheduling. This
quantitative performance criterion applies on a continuous basis.

Non-Accumulation of New Domestic Payment Arrears by the Government.


Domestic payment arrears are defined in paragraph 13.



The government undertakes not to accumulate domestic payment arrears. This
quantitative performance criterion applies on a continuous basis.

Adjusters of Quantitative Targets


To take into account the factors or changes that are essentially outside the government’s
performance, various quantitative targets for 2016 will be adjusted as follows:



If the total revenue from privatization or renewal of telecommunication licenses or forestry or

subject to a safeguards assessment every four years. For the BEAC, governance challenges and
control failures that emerged in 2009 led to close engagement subsequently through annual IMF
monitoring of safeguards “rolling measures.” A safeguards staff visit to the BEAC conducted in April
2016 found that although the BEAC’s own Reform and Modernization Plan was nearing completion,
the Fund’s two priority recommendations on governance-focused law reform and the transition to
an internationally recognized financial reporting framework (IFRS) were outstanding. However,
following the April visit, the BEAC Board mandated that the institution take steps to initiate work on
the priority recommendations. Staff has now revised the road map for implementation with an
envisaged conclusion of the law reform in early 2017 and adoption of IFRS beginning with the
financial statements for 2018. Staff will maintain close engagement with the BEAC to monitor the
implementation of the remaining safeguards measures going forward, and progress on the latter
will remain a condition for new program requests and reviews for CEMAC member countries
Exchange Rate Arrangement
The C.A.R. participates in a currency union with five other members of the CEMAC and has no
separate legal tender. The de facto exchange rate arrangement is a conventional peg; the CFA franc
is officially pegged to the euro, the intervention currency, at a fixed rate of CFAF 655.957 per €1. On
December 31, 2015, the rate of the CFA franc in terms of SDRs was SDR 1 = CFAF 813.4. C.A.R. does
not maintain any restrictions on the making of payments and transfers for current international
transactions.
Article IV Consultations
The C.A.R. is currently on the standard 24-month cycle for Article IV consultations for program
countries. The last Article IV consultation was concluded on January 13, 2013.
Resident Representative
The Fund’s office in Bangui reopened in October 2007 (after being closed in September 2003). The
Resident Representative, until end-February 2013, was Michel Bua. A new Resident Representative
was recently appointed and expected to take his position in September 2016.

JOINT BANK-FUND WORK PROGRAM
1.
The Fund and the World Bank C.A.R. teams worked closely during their recent visits to
Bangui in May 2016. At that time, both teams identified critical structural reforms in order to
coordinate the two teams’ work programs for the 2016–17.
2.
The newly elected government is focusing on addressing the key challenges facing the
country. This will include improving security, consolidating the peace and the reconciliation process,
further rebuilding government institutions, strengthening economic management, and
implementing reforms for a progressive exit from fragility.
3.
As a consequence of the 2013 crisis, the country is now assessed at high risk of
external debt, compared with a moderate risk of debt distress in the last Article IV
consultation in 2012. This reflects the collapse in GDP, tax revenues and exports—rather than an
increase in external debt. Large accumulation of domestic arrears also contributed to an increase in
total public debt. Accordingly, the country’s recourse if for grants only as the main source of external
financing.
4.
The teams agreed that C.A.R.’s main macroeconomic challenges are to create fiscal
space, strengthen public financial management (PFM), and improve policy and project
implementation capacity. Consequently, their policy advice should aim at (i) promoting prudent
fiscal policies, (ii) accelerating growth through efficient and prioritized public investment and active
participation of the private sector, (iii) deepening financial sector development, (iv) improving
human capital formation, and (v) strengthening institutions, transparency and governance.
5.
The C.A.R. authorities requested a three-year arrangement under the ECF. This will help
them support of their medium-term economic reform program to cover the period 2016–18.
6.
Based on their common assessment, the teams identified five structural reform areas
as macro-critical, in view of their central role in achieving fiscal consolidation, sustained growth,
and poverty alleviation:


Domestic resources are scarce and insufficient to meet wage payments, key social outlays
and external debt service. This has led to a significant dependence on external aid which
reached 27 percent of GDP in 2015 after a plateau of 43 percent of GDP in 2014. Rebuilding and
modernizing the revenue administration, improving tax policy, and restoring normal budget
processes are the cornerstone for the return to fiscal sustainability and to ensure that
expenditures are well managed.



Improve public financial management (PFM) and the efficiency of public spending. In this
context, it will be essential to: (i) secure and strengthen treasury management by widening the

6

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

CENTRAL AFRICAN REPUBLIC

coverage of treasury operations to all government operations and identifying all government
accounts in commercial banks and move towards a reinforced single Treasury account;
(ii) strengthen the recently established Central Accounting and Treasury Agency (ACCT;
(iii) normalize the expenditure process and limit emergency spending procedures (budget and
cash payment orders) to 5 percent of non-wage and debt-service expenditures; (iv) re-establish
proper accounting practices for all government operations, including the general budget and
budget annexes; and (v) re-establish the credibility of the state by fighting corruption and fraud
and by re-gaining creditor confidence. At the same time, steps will be taken to improve the
public investment framework to enhance project execution.


Social policies: The overarching goals of the government are: (i) assisting the IDPs and refugees
return to their lands and assets; (ii) reorganizing and redeploying public administration
throughout the country; (iii) improving access to drinking water, sanitation, and hygiene;
(iv) rehabilitating educational facilities to ensure full coverage and quality education at all levels
to children of both sexes, across the country; and (v) revitalizing the health system, including
strengthening the fight against HIV/AIDS.



Investment climate reform: Structural reforms will focus on modernizing and updating the
legal framework in the major economic sectors. Two bills aimed at boosting telecommunications
activities are under preparation and are expected to be submitted to parliament early next year.
The authorities are also updating the investment charter, the mining code, and forestry
regulation. Furthermore, steps are taken to establish a one-stop shop for administrative
procedures for investors Progress in strengthening the banking sector and in developing market
instruments should contribute to more effective financial intermediation.



Infrastructure investment. The lack of infrastructure and deficient public utilities, including
electricity, water, and telecommunications, are a major drag on investment, growth, and
development. Enhanced financial resource availability from domestic and external sources, on
adequately concessional terms will be key to scaling up public investment.

7.
The teams agreed the following division of labor, in line with the respective primary
responsibilities of our two institutions:


Financial resource mobilization: The Fund leads in providing technical assistance (TA) and
recommendations for increased mobilization of domestic resources. The Bank and the Fund will
continue to support comprehensive reforms of revenue administration. Increased revenue can
also result from improved regulation of artisanal gold and diamond mining and new exploration
permits.



PFM: The Bank leads and is planning to further support the government with policy notes and
policy dialogue in several areas, focusing, inter alia, on (i) monitoring socioeconomic
developments, , conducting review and analytical works on inclusive growth and strengthening
dialogue; and (ii) the governance agenda by taking an active role in the platform on PFM, and
supporting implementation of key reforms in public procurement. The Fund (FAD and
AFRITAC-Centre) is providing TA on progress with the implementation of the government’s

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND 7

CENTRAL AFRICAN REPUBLIC

reform agenda, as outlined by the action plan prepared by FAD in March 2016 and which was
globally endorsed by donors. In close collaboration, the Bank and the Fund support the
implementation of this agenda, including also cash management, by continuously providing TA
in various forms. The Bank is focusing its TA on programming, accounting, and oversight. The
Bank will try to access Trust Funds to continue supporting PFM reforms. The efforts of our two
institutions will be leveraged by the EU, the African Development Bank (AfDB), and France.


Social sector spending: The Bank leads in monitoring the authorities’ intervention in the social
sectors and pro-poor policies. It will update data on poverty and better define social spending
as the basis for monitoring the relevant benchmark of the Fund-supported ECF program.



Investment climate reform: The World Bank Group, is assisting C.A.R. with private sector
development and investment climate issues that affect private sector growth and access to
finance. The focus will be to: (i) strengthen the investment climate by suggesting reforms aimed
at facilitating investment and assisting the C.A.R. authorities in the design and implementation
of those reforms; (ii) coordinate the work of development partners and local stakeholders to
help improve the country’s business environment; (iii) stimulate the private sector and improve
the country’s investment prospects by building institutional capacity in regulatory and trade
bodies; and (iv) provide support to local financial intermediaries to help them develop products
that respond to the needs of small and medium-size enterprises (SMEs). The AfDB is also putting
emphasis on this area in its upcoming 2016–17 budgetary support operation and stands ready
to step-up its involvement.



Infrastructure investment. The Bank assists the authorities in project preparation and
improving project implementation capacity. It also leads in advising the authorities in
formulating realistic public investment programs and budgets, consistent with implementation
constraints, domestic financing, and available donor assistance. Debt management: The Bank
will assess, together with the AfDB, specific, well-defined infrastructure projects that cannot be
financed on concessional, should they come up, and propose to the Fund, at the time of future
program reviews, a possible course of action, consistent with safeguarding long-term debt
sustainability. The Fund will monitor repayments of domestic payment arrears reduction. The
debt department will continue to receive TA from the Fund, the Bank, and the AfDB. Bank and
Fund staff have jointly prepared a full debt sustainability analysis (DSA). The Fund and the Bank
will assist in strengthening debt management.

8.

The teams have the following requests for information from their counterparts:



The Fund team requests to be kept informed by the Bank of progress in the above macrocritical
structural and sectoral reform areas and of major strategic decisions and programs on the
macroeconomic and sectoral level. Timing: when milestones are reached (and at least semiannually).



The Bank team requests to be kept informed of the Fund’s assessments of macroeconomic
policies and prospects. Timing: in the context of program reviews, Article IV consultations, and
other missions (and at least semi-annually).

Dissemination of technical assistance reports: The authorities have committed to sharing
technical assistance reports with relevant partners in the donor coordination
framework (CGAR-PRGF).

RELATIONS WITH THE AFRICAN DEVELOPMENT BANK
1.
Cooperation between the African Development Bank (the Bank) and the C.A.R. is described
in the Interim Assistance Paper for the Transition 2014-2016, which defines the framework for
approval of all the Bank’s operations or activities in this country. The general objective of this interim
assistance from the Bank, approved by the Boards of Directors in conjunction with the operations
portfolio restructuring in June 2014, was part of the international community’s collective drive to support
the political transition process in the C.A.R. The Bank’s interim assistance revolves around two
(2) intervention pillars: (i) the rehabilitation of socio-economic and public service infrastructures to improve
the delivery of basic services to the population, particularly vulnerable groups in rural areas most affected
by the conflict; and (ii) the restoration of institutional capacities and promotion of good governance with
the specific short-term objective of helping to relaunch/redeploy the services of central and decentralized
government so as to ensure the provision of essential basic services. The C.A.R. also benefits from the
Bank’s support in the area of regional integration as described in the Regional Integration Strategy
Paper (RISP) for Central Africa, which revolves around two pillars: (a) the development of regional
infrastructures; and (b) institutional and human capacity building at the regional level. The validity date for
this latter strategy has just been extended to December 31, 2017.
2.
In the context of interim assistance to the transition in the C.A.R., portfolio restructuring
first made it possible to maintain a portfolio of relevant projects valued at US$65.4 million. Then,
new funds amounting to US$73.3 million were made available to finance new operations. This new
financing effectively facilitated the approval of two emergency budgetary support operations in 2014
(US$21 million) and 2015 (US$10.3 million), as well as two investment operations: (1) the support
program for reconstruction of grassroots communities (PARCB) in 2015, the initial phase of which
involves US$21 million; and (2) the water and sanitation sector sub-program for Bangui and four
prefectures (GEF grant) in the amount of US$7.13 million. The intervention program in 2016 plans to
grant budgetary support of US$14 million and supplemental financing for rural areas amounting to
4.5 million euros for the first water and sanitation sub-program that is now being implemented.
3.
In total, the Bank’s portfolio of current operations in the C.A.R. now consists of nine
projects, for a total commitment of about US$150 million and an overall portfolio disbursement rate
of 39.98%, primarily in the infrastructure sector (transportation, energy, water and sanitation)
representing 70% of current commitments. With the normalization of the security and political situation,
the Bank will intensify efforts to closely monitor the implementation of its operations with a view to
improving the disbursement rate in particular.
4.
The Bank anticipates that the validity period for its interim assistance to the C.A.R will be
extended to December 31, 2017, upon the conclusion of which a new four- to five-year
cooperation framework will be proposed with the C.A.R. through a new Country Strategy
Paper (2018–23).

STATISTICAL ISSUES
(As of June 17, 2016)
I.

Assessment of Data Adequacy for Surveillance

General: Data provision has shortcomings, but is broadly adequate for surveillance. Issues with
source data and compilation affect most data sets, particularly in the real sector.
National Accounts: There is a high degree of uncertainty attached to estimates of the level and
growth rate of real GDP, including because estimates for informal sector activity are still based on
a 1982 survey. Furthermore, developments in the subsistence agriculture sector, accounting for an
estimated 30 percent of the economy, are not tracked well and would benefit from the
development of source data through surveys. STA/AFC is providing technical assistance in national
accounts to rebase series, but progress is hampered by low capacity and a weak statistical system.
Price statistics: The measurement of inflation is also subject to a high degree of uncertainty since
the CPI is based on expenditure weights that are thirty years old. The index is highly skewed
toward food items (70 percent), in particular basic foodstuff, and covers only a limited number of
modern and service items. STA is providing technical assistance to update and rebalance the
index. Price data collection is occasionally suspended for lack of resources at the national statistics
institute.
Government finance statistics: Data provision is broadly satisfactory for surveillance purposes,
although coverage is not complete. The main shortcomings relate to (i) expenditures financed by
line ministries’ and government agencies’ own resources, which are estimated on the basis of
respective revenue estimates, (ii) foreign-financed investment expenditures reported bi-annually
by the Ministry of Planning, and (iii) domestic arrears accumulation. Budget accounting and
Treasury procedures, and domestic debt statistics, continue to suffer from serious shortcomings,
delays and omissions in reporting, which are addressed through various reforms. General
government statistics are not available. The new GFS resident advisor in AFRITAC Central will focus
on addressing these issues in the short-term as well as assisting the authorities to move toward
the harmonized CEMAC TOFE based on GFSM 2001 in the medium and long-terms.
Monetary statistics: Data provision is broadly satisfactory for surveillance purposes. Monetary
statistics for the central bank and other depository corporations are compiled on a monthly basis
in the format of standardized report forms (SRFs) and reported to STA by the BEAC with an
average time lag of three months.
Financial sector surveillance: In March 2016, Central African Republic began reporting financial
soundness indicators for deposit taking institutions to STA.
External sector statistics: A 2010 balance of payments statistics mission assisted the authorities
in completing the standardized reporting forms used for reporting to STA.

A three-year Japan Administered Account for Selected Activities (JSA) funded Project designed to
assist French-speaking African countries in strengthening the development and dissemination of
external sector statistics according to international standards established in the sixth edition of
Balance of Payments and International Investment Position Manual (BPM6) is scheduled to begin
during FY 2017.
Central African Republic does not report external sector statistics to STA for publication in the
Balance of Payments and International Investment Position Statistics Yearbook (BOPSY) and
International Financial Statistics (IFS). The country does not provide IIP data, due to a lack of
capacity.

Data Standards and Quality

The country participates in Enhanced General Data Dissemination Standard (e-GDDS). However,
most of its metadata, with the exception of the real sector and socio-demographic metadata, have
not been updated since 2004. There are no Data ROSC.

STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2016 ARTICLE IV CONSULTATION AND
REQUEST FOR A THREE-YEAR ARRANGEMENT UNDER THE
EXTENDED CREDIT FACILITY—DEBT SUSTAINABILITY ANALYSIS
Approved By Michael Atingi-Ego (AFR) and
Bob Traa (SPR) and John Panzer (IDA)

Prepared by the staffs of the
International Monetary Fund (IMF)
and the International Development
Association (IDA)

This debt sustainability analysis (DSA), conducted in the context of the joint IMF/IDA DSA debt
sustainability framework for low-income countries, confirms that Central African Republic (C.A.R)
continues to be assessed at high risk of external debt distress. Under the baseline scenarios,
several external debt indicators at end-2015 breached the policy-related thresholds, mainly due
to the slow recovery of exports and revenues resulting from continued insecurity. Large
accumulation of domestic arrears has contributed to an increase in total public debt. The
payment of domestic arrears will be informed by the ongoing audit of commercial, social, and
cross-debt arrears. Public debt indicators under the baseline scenario have worsened compared
with previous DSAs. The PV of debt-to-revenue ratio and the debt service to revenue ratio are
projected to be much higher than the previous DSA, essentially driven by a collapse in domestic
revenue and GDP. In addition, this analysis shows that C.A.R.’s overall risk of debt distress is high
because of significant vulnerabilities related to domestic debt. The country also has significant
vulnerabilities to adverse shocks to GDP growth, exports, exchange rate and FDI flow which
could breach the policy-related thresholds for all external debt indicators. Against this
background, it remains critical for C.A.R. to broaden its growth base by consolidating domestic
security, pursuing prudent fiscal and debt policies, including only highly concessional debt
financing, and implementing structural policies to improve budget execution and creating
conditions for private investment.

BACKGROUND AND RECENT DEVELOPMENTS
1.
Following the 2012/2013 security and political conflict, the Central African Republic (C.A.R.)
is confronted with lots of economic challenges. With a significantly low level of domestic resource
mobilization (6 percent of GDP, against 12 percent of GDP before the conflict), the economy is highly

CENTRAL AFRICAN REPUBLIC

dependent on external assistance and remains saddled with structural weaknesses that constrain an
economic rebound which is crucial to tackle pervasive poverty and rebuild social cohesion.
2.
The exports recovery is slow. In the first three quarters of 2015, economic recovery started
gaining momentum due to the successful implementation of the economic emergency program by the
transitional government and improved security. However, the renewed violence in late September 2015 put
a halt on the recovery. Real GDP grew by 4.8 percent in 2015, against an initial target of 5.5 percent. The
deterioration of security further squeezed C.A.R.’s main exports (diamond and timber). The Kimberley
Process Certification Scheme (KPCS) still put an export ban on diamond exports, pending further progress
in security and state control in that region. KCPS is conducting another mission to assess the situation and
advise on the next steps in late 2016. Timber exports, are recovering slowly from a 38 percent decline in
2013, and remain far below their pre-crisis level.
3.
C.A.R is a weak policy performer for the purpose of determining the debt burden thresholds
under the Debt Sustainability Framework. C.A.R.’s average rating in the World Bank’s Country Policy and
Institutional Assessment (CPIA) during 2012-2014 is 2.55 on a scale of 1 to 6.

STRUCTURE OF DEBT

17

4.
In 2015, C.A.R.’s total public debt to GDP ratio declined slightly from 2014, driven by the
increase in nominal GDP (11.3 percent) in 2015. At end-2015, C.A.R.’s public and publicly-guaranteed
debt (PPG) stood at CFAF 454.3 billion (48.5 percent of GDP). The PPG-to-GDP ratio declined by
2.6 percentage points from 51.1 percent at end-2014. External debt amounted to 14.5 percent of GDP.
5.
C.A.R.’s external public debt remained stable in 2015. At end-2015, C.A.R.’s public and
publicly-guaranteed external (PPGE) debt stood at CFAF 135.5 billion (Text Table 1).18 About 62.3 percent of
C.A.R.’s outstanding PPGE debt is debt owed to bilateral creditors, with multilateral creditors accounting for
the remainder. External debt was 29.8 percent of total debt. The ratio of PPGE debt to GDP is mainly driven
by changes in GDP, rising to 14.5 percent in 2015, from 9.7 percent in 2012.
6.
External public borrowing has been limited in recent years. Most of the increases in external
public borrowing represent concessional/emergency loans from multilateral creditors such as the World
Bank and the African Development Bank. External bilateral debt in percent of GDP fell to 9 percent in 2015
from 10.5 percent in 2014.as C.A.R. was not able to borrow due to its large technical arrears with bilateral
creditors. The technical arrears are all pre-HIPC and Non-Paris Club debt arrears, (except for a small
commercial amount owed to French companies). Under the Paris Club agreements, C.A.R. has committed
to negotiate the Non-Paris Club debt under the same conditions granted by the Paris Club (a 100 percent
write off of any existing debt). The government has been negotiating those terms with the Non-Paris Club
creditors but the political crisis delayed these discussions. Since 2014, the government signed only one
17
The debt (both external and public) covers only gross central government debt. Debt to IMF is included in the government’s
domestic debt as C.A.R. is part of the currency union.
18
The authorities revised up the debt stock debt from 2009 (the year of HIPC initiative) based on more complete debt data. Since
2011, the stock of debt began to increase gradually due to disbursements on new agreements signed after the initiative. The rapid
increase in stock between 2013 and 2014 is due to the rise in domestic arrears.

bilateral loan agreement with Saudi Arabia for CFAF 45 billion (denominated in Saudi riyad) in
December 2015 with an interest of 1 percent per year, a maturity of 30 years and a grace period of
10 years. The loan will finance infrastructure projects and rehabilitation of schools and health facility.
7.
Domestic debt increased significantly since 2014, mainly due to rising arrears. Domestic debt
accounts for 70 percent of the total debt in 2015, of which more than half is domestic payments arrears.
The end-2015 stock of outstanding arrears stands at CFAF 172 billion, of which CFAF 39 billion to BEAC19,
CFAF 30.3 billion in commercial debts, CFAF 80 billion in social debts, and CFAF 22 billion in cross-debt and
other debts. The settlement of the audited arrears will be part of the medium-term strategy to reduce
domestic debt.

UNDERLYING DSA ASSUMPTIONS
8.
The baseline macroeconomic assumptions for this DSA have been updated based on
developments in 2015, consistent with the macroeconomic framework underlying the proposed ECF
arrangement. In the short- to medium-term, the baseline scenario is anchored on two main assumptions,
including improved political and security conditions and continued donor support. In this context, staff is
projecting growth rates averaging 5.5 percent for the medium term as the rebound is expected to be
progressive as the economic fabric has deteriorated over the years. Growth will be mainly driven by
agriculture, trade, transportation and public investment. Nevertheless, this will only partly offset the sharp
contraction in 2013. In the long run, growth rates are projected to remain around an average of 3.4 percent,
about the same as in the previous DSA, reflecting the same assumptions on economic activities as previous
DSA. In the fiscal area, the primary fiscal balance recorded a deficit of 3.4 percent of GDP in 2015,
compared with a deficit of 3.0 percent of GDP projected in the 2015 DSA (Box 1). The main changes to the
macroeconomic projections compared with the previous DSA in 2015 are an upward revision in the

19

CENTRAL AFRICAN REPUBLIC

external debt-to-GDP ratio, and a downward revision in both the primary fiscal deficit and overall fiscal
balance. Also, the non-interest current account deficit is now lower than in the 2015 DSA (Text Table 2).

Box 1. Central African Republic: Macroeconomic Assumptions for 2016–35
Real GDP growth is expected to average 5.5 percent during 2016–18, Growth will be mainly
driven by a rebound in agriculture, livestock, construction, and trade as well as the gradual
resumption of mining (following the re-certification by the Kimberley Process Certification
Scheme) and forestry activities. The lack of a significant rebound in economic activity that could
be expected from a low base is attributable to the gradual weakening of the country’s economic
structure and the lack of infrastructure and energy. Therefore, CAR is projected to partially catch
up from the contraction recorded during the 2013 crisis. The long-term growth rates are kept at
3.5 percent, similar to the previous DSA.
Average inflation is expected to stabilize over the medium term, with convergence to 3 percent
in the long run, in line with CEMAC convergence criteria.
The primary fiscal balance is expected to steadily improve to reach an average of around
2 percent of GDP in the medium term, and then shift to about 1 percent of GDP over the long
run (2035). Government revenue (including grants) is projected to reach 20.8 percent of GDP in
the long run, and primary expenditures are expected to reach 21.8 percent of GDP in 2036,
mainly on account of higher domestically-financed capital spending.
The non-interest current account deficit is projected to decline to 10.6 percent of GDP in 2016,
and to decline gradually in the medium to long term. Exports are expected to pick up, resulting
from the planned recovery of mining and forestry activities, both boosted by improved security
conditions and the expected full lifting of the diamond export ban in the medium term.
Nevertheless, exports in percent of GDP will remain broadly unchanged from their pre-conflict
level due to the narrow export base. The relatively higher non-interest current deficit (compared
with before-crisis years) during 2016–19 is partly due to the increase of investment-related
imports.
External assistance: Grant-equivalent financing is about 4.9 percent of GDP in 2016 and is
assumed at about 3.9 percent of GDP in the long run.

EXTERNAL DEBT SUSTAINABILITY RESULTS
9.
Under the baseline scenario, several external debt indicators breach the threshold. The
present value (PV) of debt-to-exports ratio is projected to stay above the policy threshold from
2020. The debt service-to-export ratio and the debt service-to-revenue ratio breaches the threshold
in 2015. As was the case in the 2015 DSA, these outcomes reflect essentially C.A.R.’s narrow export
base and the slow recovery of exports and government revenues. In contrast, the PV of debt-to-GDP
ratio lies below the threshold in 2015 and is expected to maintain this position throughout the
projection period (Figure 1 and Text Table 3). These results are broadly similar to those of the
2015 DSA. However, considering C.A.R. as a post-HIPC debt relief country and in view of its current
fragile post-conflict situation, this DSA assumes that the authorities will strengthen their debt
management capacities and continue to seek highly concessional financing. This, together with
improved macroeconomic management, will lead to improvements in the debt service-to-exports,
debt-service-to-revenues, and PV of debt-to revenue ratios in the long run.
10.
The current DSA results reaffirm the findings of the 2015 DSA, namely that C.A.R.’s
risk of external debt distress is high. In the most extreme scenario, all indicators breach the
threshold. In particular, the PV of debt-to-exports ratio remains above the policy threshold under
the extreme scenario for a significant period. And the PV of debt-to-revenue ratio stays above the
policy threshold under the extreme scenario till 2025.
11.
Alternative scenarios and stress tests highlight the vulnerabilities already contained in
this DSA. The historical scenario includes the crisis years and the 2009 HIPC debt relief that reduced
C.A.R.’s external debt vulnerability. Therefore, the historical scenario could not adequately reflect the
baseline prospects for C.A.R. in the near future and long run. Under a scenario of combined adverse
shocks on GDP growth, exports, exchange rate and FDI flow, three indicators worsen compared with
the baseline scenario: (i) the PV of debt-to-GDP ratio worsens and breaches the threshold starting in

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

CENTRAL AFRICAN REPUBLIC

2016; (ii) the PV of debt-to-exports ratio breaches the threshold until 2036; and (iii) the PV of
debt-to-revenue will also deteriorate and breach the threshold in the medium term and only decline
in the long run. These results underscore the need to: (i) foster a sound macroeconomic
environment that would promote growth, domestic revenue mobilization, facilitate an export
recovery, and enable FDI inflows; (ii) continue the reform agenda in order to avoid the return to
unsustainable debt levels observed before 2009; (iii) continue improving security.
12.
The bound test results suggest that C.A.R.’s slow recovery in exports is the most
significant factor that contributes to its vulnerability of debt sustainability. If export value
growth is at historical average minus one standard deviation in 2016-17, the debt-to-exports ratio
rises to above 100 in 2017 and stays significantly above the policy threshold for the entire test
period.

PUBLIC DEBT SUSTAINABILITY RESULTS
13.
Compared to the previous DSA, public debt indicators under the baseline scenario
worsened. In contrast to the previous DSA, the PV of public debt-to-GDP ratios are now projected to
remain above the 38 percent benchmark throughout 2016–19, but is on a declining trend as
macroeconomic conditions improve. The PV of public debt-to-GDP ratio and PV of debt-to-revenue ratio
are projected to be much higher than the previous DSA in the medium term, reflecting a slower-thanprojected recovery of government revenues (see Text Table 4). This reflected a lower-than-expected
economic activity, associated with the continued insecurity, two inoperative regional tax and customs
directorates, and imports consisting mainly of food products subject to low customs duties in 2015. In
addition, the rapid accumulation of domestic arrears (16.3 percent of GDP from 2012 to 2015) increased
vulnerabilities of the domestic debt. However, all indicators are going to improve in the medium term and
long run in line with the improved security and macroeconomic situation.

The alternative scenarios suggest that the baseline is very sensitive to the growth
assumptions. The most extreme shock—a one-standard deviation drop in the growth rate for 2016 and
2017—will substantially increase the public debt and keep C.A.R.’s PV of debt-to-GDP ratio above the
benchmark throughout the entire period (Figure 2 and Table 2). The PV of debt-to-revenue ratio is also
projected to rise under the most extreme shock, and debt service-to-revenue ratio will also increase
significantly in the medium term.
15.
The public DSA analysis shows that C.A.R.’s overall risk of debt distress is high because of
significant vulnerabilities related to domestic debt. Public debt level is high mainly due to the presence
of domestic arrears as a result of the GDP collapse from the 2013 crisis. The country continues to have
significant vulnerabilities to adverse shocks to GDP growth. Staff and the authorities agree that maintaining
domestic security is a priority to reduce the potential adverse shocks to growth and exports and therefore
debt distress. Meanwhile, reforms should focus on enhancing revenue administration and public financial
administration efforts and structural reforms to increase potential economic growth.

CONCLUSION
16.
As in the previous DSA, C.A.R.’s debt remains at high risk of distress. The debt sustainability
indicators have worsened. Although external debt-to-GDP ratio stays below the benchmark, almost all the
external and public debt indicators deteriorate. In particular, the PV of external debt-to-exports ratio
remains for a significant period well above the policy threshold under the extreme scenario.

C.A.R. needs to consolidate the basis for growth by fostering domestic security, maintaining
macroeconomic and political stability, and developing the country’s institutional and administrative
capacity. As the public debt is highly vulnerable to slower GDP growth, structural policies that improve the
business climate, boost productivity and diversify the export base would contribute to improving the debt
rating.
18.
C.A.R. should pursue a debt strategy limited to grant and highly concessional financing.
The high-risk classification and the vulnerabilities evidenced by the alternative and stress test scenarios
underline the importance of increasing exports from the traditional forestry and diamond sectors, while
taking steps to widen the export base. At the same time, it is essential for C.A.R. to steadfastly strengthen
macroeconomic stability and pursue fiscal reforms and through sound policies, step up domestic revenue
mobilization, and restrain non priority expenditures. Meanwhile, it is critical for the authorities to intensify
their efforts to substantially improve public debt management, with assistance from the Regional Technical
Assistance Center for Central Africa, and push for funding and putting in place Version 6.0 of the Debt
Management and Financial Analysis System (DMFAS) software. Also, more stringent procedures should be
put in place to ensure that new financial commitments are undertaken only with the approval and
signature of the minister of finance. Finally, to the maximum extent possible, C.A.R. should rely on grant
financing, considering its fragile post-conflict situation. Beyond that, staff encourages the authorities to
continue to seek maximum concessionality in their external financing.

2/ Derived as [r - g - ρ(1+g)]/(1+g+ρ+gρ) times previous period debt ratio, with r = nominal interest rate; g = real GDP growth rate, and ρ = growth rate of GDP deflator in U.S. dollar terms.
3/ Includes exceptional financing (i.e., changes in arrears and debt relief); changes in gross foreign assets; and valuation adjustments. For projections also includes contribution from price and exchange rate changes. The large residuals reflect
the narrow coverage of the debt and the exclusion of the large technical arrears with non-Paris club creditors.
4/ Assumes that PV of private sector debt is equivalent to its face value.
5/ Current-year interest payments divided by previous period debt stock.
6/ Historical averages and standard deviations are generally derived over the past 10 years, subject to data availability.
7/ Defined as grants, concessional loans, and debt relief.
8/ Grant-equivalent financing includes grants provided directly to the government and through new borrowing (difference between the face value and the PV of new debt).

Sources: Country authorities; and staff estimates and projections.

1/ Variables include real GDP growth, growth of GDP deflator (in U.S. dollar terms), non-interest current account in percent of GDP, and non-debt creating flows.
2/ Assumes that the interest rate on new borrowing is by 2 percentage points higher than in the baseline., while grace and maturity periods are the same as in the baseline.
3/ Exports values are assumed to remain permanently at the lower level, but the current account as a share of GDP is assumed to return to its baseline level after the shock
(implicitly assuming an offsetting adjustment in import levels).
4/ Includes official and private transfers and FDI.
5/ Depreciation is defined as percentage decline in dollar/local currency rate, such that it never exceeds 100 percent.
6/ Applies to all stress scenarios except for A2 (less favorable financing) in which the terms on all new financing are as specified in footnote 2.

Statement by Mr. Ngueto Yambaye, Executive Director for the Central African
Republic, and Mr. Bangrim Kibassim, Advisor to the Executive Director
July 20, 2016
My Central African Authorities are thankful to the Executive Board, Management and staff
for their continued support which has been invaluable in the efforts to improve the
economy following the major crisis that the country experienced in the recent past. Indeed,
under three Rapid Credit Facility (RCF) the CAR was able to meet urgent balance of
payments needs, restore macroeconomic stability and rebuild to a certain extend
administrative capacity.
I.

RECENT DEVELOPMENTS

Real GDP growth has progressed from 1 percent in 2014 to 4.8 percent in 2015, supported
by agriculture, trade, services and construction sector. In the short term, economic prospects
are favorable and growth is projected at 5.2 percent in 2016. Inflation decreased to
4.5 percent in 2015 following a peak at 11.6 percent in 2014, after the main access to sea
(the Bangui- Douala corridor) has been made secure and supply conditions improved.
Following the collapse in domestic revenue (from 11.5 percent of GDP in 2012 to
4.5 percent in 2014) and in exports of diamonds and forestry products, respectively, the
fiscal and current accounts deficits widened.
External financial support enabled the authorities to meet the most urgent financial needs
such as wages and the clearance of some arrears. At the same time, the authorities
implemented important reform measures in the fiscal sector which have helped to mobilize
revenue and control expenditure.
Democratic elections were held in early 2016 and led to the inauguration of a new
government which is committed to the promotion of national reconciliation, the
transformation of the economy, and the creation of employment opportunities. The
authorities are also committed to good governance and better economic management, and
wish to build on the progress achieved under the RCF. In this regard, they have developed
an ambitious economic program with the assistance of development partners and the IMF
staff, and for which they are requesting Fund’s support under a three-year arrangement
under the Extended Credit Facility(ECF).
The Medium Term Program, 2016-2019
The authorities recognize the critical importance of political and social stability as a basis for
economic development. They are, therefore, working diligently with all stakeholders to
consolidate the security situation, promote national reconciliation and social peace and build
human and administrative capacities. The program also aims at restoring and building basic
infrastructure and utilities. Improving social conditions with better access to health and
education is also critical to reduce widespread poverty and promote human development.

Real GDP is projected to grow at an average of 5.5 percent over the medium term, helped by
improved security situation and recovery in all the sectors of the economy, and the
resumption of public and private investment. Average inflation is projected to be about
3 percent. The domestic primary deficit should decline from 3.3 percent of GDP in 2016 to
0.9 percent in 2019. Despite the reduction in the wage bill from 6 percent of GDP in 2015 to
5.3 percent in 2016, public spending is expected to increase by 2.2 percentage points of GDP
owing to an increase in capital and social spending. The current account deficit is projected to
increase due to sizable reconstructions needs.
Economic and financial policies for 2016-19:
The authorities will pursue policies aimed at ensuring fiscal sustainability while
accumulating buffers. The government's strategy is focused on revenue mobilization and
addressing challenges associated with improving public financial management.
Measures to increase revenues in 2016 include:
i) a new price structure for oil products based on international prices
ii) tightening inspection and control on exported forestry products and;
iii) strict application of the banking agreement on revenue collection to
ensure traceability
With the view to raise domestic revenue from 7.1 percent of GDP in 2015 to 10.1 percent in
GDP by 2019, the authorities will implement a medium term action plan prepared in
collaboration with a FAD TA mission and that aims at:
i) broadening the tax base and simplifying tax procedures, including improving
management of the VAT system and the base for assessing export taxes;
ii) strengthening tax and customs administration, including introducing precompleted tax returns for real estate; revision of fiscal exemptions agreements;
iii) harmonization of the General Investment Code by implementing the CEMAC
directives on VAT and duties; and; (iv)streamlining and enhancing management
of tax exemptions.
The authorities will also keep a firm control over spending. Measures are being taken to
control the wage bill and to clean the roster of the civil service, and ensure timely retirement
of eligible civil servants. On the other hand, the authorities expect that the fiscal measures
they are taking will enable them to increase spending on goods and services and
domestically financed capital spending.
Measures are also being undertaken to enhance public financial management. They include
pursuing strict treasury management and strengthening the fiscal policy framework through a
comprehensive action plan prepared with support from the Fund and other partners.

Management of domestic payments arrears:
To achieve fiscal consolidation and restore creditors' confidence, the authorities are
committed to clear domestic payments arrears including commercial arrears and cross-debts,
and creditors of which BEAC and commercial banks. In this process the government plan to
complete an audit and have the claims validated by end-June 2017.The settlement of
validated domestic payments arrears is planned for July 2017. Commercial, wages and
pension arrears dating back to 2013–14 will be resolved in 2016 and 2017 respectively.
Debt management
The authorities will also take steps to strengthen public debt management and implement a
prudent borrowing policy. To that end, authorities agree that grants should be the main
source of external financing. Regarding external arrears, authorities have undertaken
discussions with creditors with view to find an agreeable solution.
Capacity building framework
Authorities concur that the success of their program depends also on a timely coordinated
Technical Assistance and an efficient use of it. They have put in place an institutional
framework to rebuild capacity, coordinate TA and monitor reforms.
II.

STRUCTURAL REFORMS

Banking and financial sector reforms:
The contribution of the financial sector to CAR economy is low due to the banking system
weaknesses. To reverse this trend, a series of measures approved by the National Credit
Council are underway and whose objectives are to:
i) Explain the government’s medium-term strategy to enhance the country’s
economic profile
ii) Organize training seminars to increase banks’, businesses’ and the general
public’s knowledge of the financial sector
iii) Protect the integrity of the banking system and monitor risk management and lending
practices in order to deal with potential risks (in this context, COBAC is requested
to send a banking supervision mission)
iv) Create an action plan for the establishment of commercial and property registries; and
v) Authorize more banks to engage in mobile banking activities.
The authorities plan to improve credit supply by establishing a credit bureau to reduce the
information asymmetry and support small and medium-sized enterprises and commercial
banks. They are also examining the feasibility of creating a guarantee fund for financing
these small and medium-size enterprises.

Development strategy and structural reforms:
To implement a successful development strategy, the authorities are committed to establish a
favorable environment for private sector by initiating structural and institutional reforms to
promote its development. In this regard a Joint Business Improvement Framework (CMAA)
to promote and enhance the government-private sector dialogue will be implemented as well
as a one-stop shop to facilitate administrative procedures for investors. In addition, two laws
to revitalize telecommunications activities are in preparation and the government intend to
update the investment charter, the mining code, the telecommunications code and enhance
the regulation of the forestry sector.
Over the medium-term, the government strategy will be focused on:
- Developing food, cash and exports crops.
- Promoting agro-forestry and downstream operations to create value added and jobs.
- Developing mining activities in a formalized context to make these activities more
attractive to large operators.
- Repairing and restoring highways, rural roads, dry ports and provincial airports.
- Expanding transportation and telecommunications infrastructure.
- Developing energy capacities.
Social policy:
The disruption of the social fabric resulting from the crises calls for appropriate measures to
enhance the resilience of the population. A successful
Disarmament-Demobilization-Reintegration (DDR) process combined with the return of
refugees and displaced persons is a major step in this sense. Furthermore, the country’s
social policy is centered on re-launching of activities in essential social sectors, improving
civil protection, restoring and reorganizing the public administration throughout the national
territory. The specific objectives of this policy are:
i) The restoration of social cohesion and reduction of tensions in the community to
support the local economic recovery and the creation of temporary jobs, primarily
for young people.
ii) Access to safe drinking water, sanitation and hygiene.
iii) The rehabilitation of the education sector to ensure full education coverage and
complete high-quality education, including access to all levels for all children.
iv) New impetus to the health care system, including the strengthening of the
fight against HIV/AIDS.
CONCLUSION:
Our Central African authorities would like to express their good appreciation of the relation
with the Fund and welcomed Staff’s recommendations. They are strongly committed to
pursue reforms with Fund’s assistance and would appreciate the support of Directors to their
request for a Three-Year Arrangement Under the Extended Credit Facility (ECF) in support
of their medium-term economic reform program.
