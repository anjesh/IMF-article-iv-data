STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2012 ARTICLE IV CONSULTATION

KEY ISSUES
Context: After two years of robust expansion driven by strong domestic demand,
output growth is expected to moderate towards potential in 2012. The output gap is
closed and labor markets remain tight, although inflation pressures have eased and
inflation expectations remain anchored at the official target. The key downside risks are
spillovers from a sharp escalation of financial tensions in the euro area, and the
possibility of a significant growth slowdown in China, resulting in a sharp fall in copper
prices.
Fiscal policy: The withdrawal of fiscal stimulus continued in 2011, but some easing of
the fiscal stance is projected for 2012. It would be desirable to keep tight control on
expenditure in the remainder of the year to avoid adding fuel to a strong economy.
Staff recommended aiming for a positive structural balance over the medium term, and
frontloading the consolidation if economic conditions remain favorable.
Monetary policy: The authorities have appropriately maintained a neutral stance in
recent months. In the event of an intensification of financial tensions in the euro area,
decisive actions should be taken to maintain confidence. With inflation below the
target, there is ample space to ease monetary policy if needed. Exchange rate flexibility
will remain an important buffer against terms of trade shocks and volatile capital flows.
Mitigating risks to financial stability: To minimize risks of negative spillover effects
and guard against excessive risk-taking in the current favorable economic environment,
banks should maintain high levels of liquidity and capital, and continue to diversify
external funding sources. Continued monitoring of the rise in corporate leverage is
warranted. Staff supports the authorities’ efforts to strengthen further the prudential
framework of the financial system.
Raising productivity growth: The government’s recent initiatives to foster female
labor participation, streamline the business incorporation process, and strengthen the
protection of intellectual rights are welcome. Increasing labor market flexibility and
enhancing energy supply should remain on the structural reform agenda.

2012 ARTICLE IV REPORT

CHILE

BACKDROP: SUSTAINED STRONG GROWTH
1.
Chile’s economy has expanded at a
robust pace. The economy recovered rapidly
from the global financial crisis, supported by a
solid policy framework, sound banking system,
and favorable commodity price developments.
Real GDP grew by about 6 percent during
2010–11 on the back of exceptionally dynamic
domestic demand, and strong growth has
continued in early 2012 (Figure 1).

2.
The output gap has closed and some
pressures on capacity constraints have
emerged. The unemployment rate has
declined to a historically low level, labor
shortages have been reported in some sectors,
and real wage growth has been strong
(Figure 2). Both labor force participation and
employment increased rapidly in the last two
years, although their growth rates have
moderated in recent months. The surge in
domestic demand fueled import growth, and
the external current account balance turned
negative in 2011, despite record high copper
prices (Figure 3).
3.
Inflation pressures have moderated
and inflation expectations remain anchored.
Core and headline inflation increased rapidly in
2011, driven by rising import prices and wages.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

4.
Bank credit growth has been strong.
Although credit standards have tightened in
recent months, loan demand remains robust.
Bank credit in real terms is growing by more
than 10 percent, with particularly strong
growth in corporate and consumer loans
(Figure 4). In contrast, non-bank consumer
credit, which accounts for about 30 percent of
consumer credit, has declined since mid-2011.

More recently, price pressures have eased as
food and energy prices declined. Year-on-year
headline inflation fell to 2.6 percent in June,
and core inflation has moderated as well.
Inflation expectations remain close to the
3-percent official target.

5.
The real exchange rate is broadly in
line with fundamentals. The real effective
exchange rate has appreciated substantially
over the past ten years. The appreciation has
been driven by fundamentals, particularly by
improving terms of trade. In recent months,
the exchange rate has been close to its longterm average level. Staff estimates using IMF’s
EBA and CGER methodologies suggest that the
real effective exchange rate is broadly in line
with fundamentals. This assessment is

CHILE

supported by the fact that Chile’s world market
share of agricultural and industrial exports has
remained broadly stable since 2003.
6.
Net private capital inflows turned
positive in 2011. The main contributing factor
was a switch in private pension funds’ portfolio
allocation from foreign to domestic assets. FDI
inflows were also strong, especially in the
mining sector. At end 2011, the balance of
payments recorded a surplus of US$14 billion
(6 percent of GDP). Chile’s net external
liabilities, at 10 percent of GDP as of end-2011
(Figure 6), are relatively modest compared with
other emerging market countries. Overall,
Chile’s external position is broadly consistent
with underlying fundamentals (Box 1).
7.
The monetary policy stance is
broadly neutral. The central bank raised the
policy rate by 475 basis points to 5¼ percent
from mid-2010 to June 2011. Since a one-off
easing in January 2012, amid uncertain global
financial conditions, the policy rate has been
kept at 5 percent. The central bank completed
the pre-announced US$12 billion foreign
exchange purchases program in December
2011, strengthening reserve adequacy
measures.
8.
Spillovers from volatility in global
financial markets have been limited thus
far. Stock market prices have moved broadly
in line with prices in other emerging markets.
Despite some increase since mid-2011, bank
funding costs remain well below their levels
after the Lehman crisis. A rise in liquidity
pressures in domestic money markets in
December 2011 was successfully contained
with temporary liquidity measures.
9.
The withdrawal of fiscal stimulus
continued in 2011, but some easing of the
policy stance is projected for 2012. The

2012 ARTICLE IV REPORT

structural fiscal deficit (which adjusts for the
economic and copper price cycles, see Annex I)
narrowed by about 1½ percentage points of
GDP in 2011, as expenditure growth slowed
down and a temporary corporate tax increase
gave a boost to revenue. The non-mining
structural primary balance in percent of nonmining GDP (a metric which captures better
the economic effects of fiscal policy in
commodity-producing countries) also showed
significant fiscal withdrawal (Table 2).1
However, an increase in education and other
social spending in 2012 will result in some
easing of the fiscal policy stance in 2012. Real
government expenditure is projected to grow
at 6½ percent, more than real GDP growth,
and the non-mining primary structural deficit
is projected to widen.

A tax reform, expected to yield
about 0.3 percent of GDP in additional
revenue, has been recently proposed by the
government. The reform will make permanent
the increase in the corporate tax rate from 17

In principle, changes in the overall and the nonmining structural balances should be similar. Notable
differences would arise when there is a significant
change in the long-term copper price set by the expert
committee, since that affects structural copper
revenues.

to 20 percent.2 There would be offsetting
reductions in taxes on personal income and
financial transactions. The net increase in
revenues relies in part on the elimination of tax
loopholes and improvements in tax collection
(see Annex II for details). The bill was
submitted to Congress in August; if approved,
it will take effect in late 2012.
11.
The authorities’ macroeconomic
policies over the past year have been
broadly in line with Fund advice. As

recommend by staff, an ambitious fiscal
withdrawal in 2011 helped reduce domestic
demand pressures and build up fiscal assets.
However, the authorities chose to leave their
medium-term structural deficit target
unchanged at 1 percent of GDP, instead of
aiming for continued gradual fiscal
consolidation. Progress has been made in
strengthening the regulatory and supervisory
framework of the financial sector and reducing
information gaps.

OUTLOOK AND RISKS
12.
Looking forward, growth is expected
to moderate. Staff’s central scenario assumes
no escalation of tensions in the euro area and
moderate global growth (in line with the July
2012 WEO projections). In this context, real
GDP growth for 2012 is expected to be around
4¾ percent, broadly in line with staff’s
estimate of Chile’s potential growth. Private
consumption growth is projected to slow
down as employment growth moderates.
Demand for durable goods has already slowed
from high post-earthquake levels. Machinery
and equipment investment growth would also
moderate, although construction and
engineering works investment would remain
robust, supported by large mining and energy
projects. Net exports should have a smaller
negative contribution to growth compared to
2011, as real import growth converges to the
rate of growth of domestic demand. In spite of
this, the external current account deficit is
projected to widen further (to about 3 percent
2

The corporate tax rate was increased from 17 percent
in 2010 to 20 percent in 2011, and 18.5 percent in
2012, to help finance reconstruction from the February
2010 earthquake.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

of GDP), due in part to less favorable terms of
trade. Both core and headline inflation rates
are expected to remain close to the target as
domestic demand growth moderates and
import prices remain subdued.
13.
Large risks surround the baseline
scenario. On the upside, domestic demand
may grow faster than expected, supported by
strong wage growth and positive consumer
and business confidence. With the output gap
already closed, additional pressures on
capacity constraints would put upward
pressure on inflation and on the external
current account deficit. Further widening of the
current account deficit would increase Chile’s
exposure to external shocks. There are two key
downside risks:


Renewed escalation of financial tensions in
the euro area. Although direct bank
funding exposure to the euro area is small,
an intensification of tensions in Europe
could have negative effects on confidence,
affecting the availability and cost of funds
for Chilean banks and corporations.3

CHILE



Sharp growth deceleration in China. Copper
accounts for more than half of all exports
and China is Chile’s main trading partner. A
significant slowdown in China’s economic
growth, accompanied by a decline in world
commodities demand, could prompt a
sharp fall in copper prices, affecting Chile’s
current account and growth prospects.

Heightened volatility of capital flows is another
risk. In the near term, bouts of increased global
investors’ risk aversion may trigger capital
outflows. Over the medium term, the prospect
of a prolonged period of low interest rates in
advanced economies may induce new waves
of capital flows to fast-growing emerging
markets like Chile, fueling credit growth and
raising the risk of asset price bubbles.4

2012 ARTICLE IV REPORT

14.
The authorities broadly agreed with
the outlook and the characterization of the
key risks. They noted that, historically,
domestic pension funds have provided a
natural hedge against capital outflows,
increasing their purchases of domestic assets
in times of rising global risk aversion. They also
emphasized that the flexible exchange rate is
an effective shock absorber, and would help
mitigate the effect of external shocks on the
current account deficit. They also noted that
the recent deterioration in the current account
balance had been driven in part by higher
foreign investment in the mining sector, which
would help support future exports.

POLICY DISCUSSIONS
Discussions focused on policies to preserve macroeconomic stability and reduce vulnerability to
external shocks. In particular, discussions centered on the appropriate policy mix under the
baseline and various risk scenarios; the importance of maintaining strong fiscal buffers; measures
to preserve financial sector stability; and the challenge of raising productivity growth.

A. Near-Term Policy Mix
15.
Staff argued that it would be
desirable to maintain tight control of fiscal
expenditure in the remainder of 2012. The
withdrawal of fiscal stimulus in 2011 helped
reduce overheating pressures, contain the rise
in consumer prices, and increase net public
assets. However, there is some easing of the
fiscal stance in 2012, despite a favorable
cyclical position. Staff suggested keeping tight

dependence on external financing were more

control on expenditure in the remainder of the
year and allocating any savings to improve the
fiscal balance, as was done in 2011. Fiscal
restraint also would help contain the
deterioration of the external current account.
The authorities responded that there is limited
flexibility to deviate from the expenditure level
approved in the Budget.
16.
There was agreement that monetary
policy should remain responsive to global
4

CHILE

and domestic shocks. Staff saw the current
neutral stance as appropriate, given the
prospect of a slowdown in output growth
towards potential and volatile global financial
conditions. With domestic risks mostly on the
upside, staff and central bank officials agreed

that wage developments, credit growth, and
other indicators of capacity constraints
pressures had to be monitored carefully. The
authorities reiterated their commitment to
respond quickly if any of the downside risk
scenarios were to materialize.

B. Coping with Risks
17.
A sharp deterioration of external
financing conditions should trigger resolute
actions to maintain confidence and ensure
orderly functioning of domestic markets.
There was agreement that the authorities
should be prepared to use measures similar to
those deployed in Chile after the Lehman crisis
to contain liquidity pressures, including
expanding repo operations, broadening the
range of accepted collateral, and setting up
dollar swap auctions. Staff emphasized that a
good communication strategy would also be
important to preserve confidence. With
inflation near the target and well-anchored
inflation expectations, there is ample space to
ease monetary policy, if necessary. Automatic
fiscal stabilizers would also provide support.
Staff indicated that temporary fiscal stimulus
should be considered only as a last resort, if
there is evidence of a sharp decline in activity.
The authorities agreed and noted that they
have prepared a crisis contingency plan,
including measures to maintain employment
and temporary fiscal stimulus, but that it will
be put in action only in case of a large
negative shock to output.
18.
There was agreement that exchange
rate flexibility would help mitigate the
economic impact of a sharp decline in the
external terms of trade. Depending on the
size of the shock, temporary easing of
macroeconomic policies could also be

8

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

appropriate to help smooth the adjustment. It
would be important, however, to avoid a large
permanent decline in government net assets.
19.
Staff and the authorities concurred
that exchange rate flexibility would also
remain the first line of defense if capital
flows volatility were to increase. Staff noted
that the flexible exchange rate has helped
contain speculative investment in the past by
reducing one-sided bets on the currency, and
should remain the main tool to limit capital
flow pressures. If strong inflows resume,
raising the risk of credit and asset price
bubbles, macroeconomic policies may need to
be adjusted accordingly. There was broad
agreement that macroprudential policies could
also be considered, if necessary. The choice of
measures would depend on the specific issues
that arise. Staff suggested including the option
of setting time-varying capital buffers in the
revised General Banking Law to increase the
range of available macroprudential
instruments. The authorities noted that Chilean
banks typically keep capital buffers well above
the required minimum, so using
countercyclical capital buffers as a
macroprudential tool may be difficult.

CHILE

2012 ARTICLE IV REPORT

C. Medium-Term Fiscal Policy
20.
Staff emphasized that maintaining
strong fiscal buffers should remain a key
priority. Chile’s high dependence on volatile
commodity income and vulnerability to
adverse global financial developments and
natural disasters make large fiscal buffers
particularly important. The 2009 financial crisis
illustrated the sensitivity of Chile’s net asset
position to large external shocks. Central
government net assets stood at 8.7 percent of
GDP at the end of 2011 (compared to almost
20 percent in 2008), and are projected to
decline as a share of GDP in the medium
term.

21.
Staff recommended targeting a
structural balance by 2015, and weighing
the benefits of targeting a small structural
surplus thereafter. A structural surplus target
would help maintain significant fiscal buffers,
which would increase policymakers’ flexibility
to respond to adverse shocks in the future
and would prepare the country better to meet
longer-term fiscal challenges related to
population aging. The authorities agreed that
maintaining strong fiscal buffers is important,
and that it would be desirable to aim for
structural surpluses further out, but noted
that the planning horizon of the current
administration ends in 2014. They reiterated

their commitment to attain a structural fiscal
deficit of 1 percent of GDP by 2014, and to
keep the growth rate of public expenditure
below GDP growth on average over the term
of the administration. Staff supported the
commitment, but argued that a faster pace of
consolidation would be desirable if economic
conditions remain favorable.5
22.
The authorities agreed with staff
that new permanent spending
commitments should be matched with
permanent revenue increases. The tax
reform proposed by the government aims to
finance the increase in education spending
envisaged in the budget. Staff noted that to
achieve the targeted increase in tax collection,
further improvements in tax administration
may be necessary. The authorities pointed out
that tax collection has already improved in the
last two years.
23.
Staff suggested that work to
strengthen further the medium-term fiscal
framework should continue. Staff welcomed
recent improvements in the medium-term
fiscal expenditure forecasting framework,
implemented with the help of Fund experts.
Drawing on the recommendations of the
advisory commission of the fiscal rule set up
by the government in 2010, staff supported
the establishment of an independent Fiscal
Council. The authorities responded that they
expect to set up a Fiscal Council in the coming
months. In addition, staff suggested
5

Based on the latest fiscal projections (in the 2012
Budget), the structural fiscal deficit in 2013 would be
1.3 percent of GDP. If the proposed tax reform is
adopted, the structural balance will be around 1
percent in 2013 (unchanged from 2012), in the
absence of changes in expenditure plans.

incorporating long-term fiscal projections and
an assessment of key fiscal risks in the regular
budget discussions to inform policymaking
and help anchor medium-term fiscal targets.
These long-term projections should take into
account expenditure changes related to
demographic developments, as well as

potential pressures on the revenue side
(including the rise in copper extraction costs).
The authorities noted that they plan to extend
the annual report on long-term fiscal trends
to include projections of health care and
education spending.

D. Maintaining Financial Stability
24.
Chile’s banks remain well capitalized
and profitable. Both regulatory and Tier 1
capital levels are high (above 14 percent and
10 percent respectively). Bank liquidity ratios
are also relatively high. Returns on assets and
equity are comfortable (see text table), and
non-performing loans are low, at about
2½ percent of total loans. The share of
external financing in total bank financing
remains below 10 percent. Moreover, since late
2010, banks have diversified geographically
their external funding sources (Figure 7).
25.
So far, bank deleveraging in Europe
and strains in the Spanish banking system
have had limited effect on Chile’s banks.
Subsidiaries of Spanish banks have substantial
presence in Chile (see chart). In November
2011, Santander Spain sold 7.8 percent of its
shares in Santander Chile. The sale caused a
temporary drop in the stock price, but had no
notable effect on system-wide credit.

Household leverage has remained
broadly stable and house price growth has
been moderate (Figure 9). Household debt
has grown broadly in line with disposable
income since 2008, and debt service as a share
of income also has remained broadly stable. A
recently released index of house prices
suggests that real annual price increases have
been fairly modest since 2004. Loan-to-value
ratios for new mortgage loans average about
80 percent. A potential area of concern is the
rate of growth of bank consumer loans, which
remains high despite some deceleration in
recent months.
27.
Corporate debt as share of GDP has
increased somewhat since 2010. The pace of
growth of credit to corporates has been above
trend since mid-2011, although it remains
below thresholds that have been associated
with a credit boom in the literature. The rise in
leverage is concentrated in certain sectors,
including construction and retail, which could
increase their vulnerability to a slowdown in

CHILE

economic activity. New data on commercial
real estate show that price growth has been
broadly in line with fundamentals, despite
some acceleration in 2011. The share of
external debt has remained broadly
unchanged, at about 30 percent of total
corporate debt. Central bank data suggest that
there are no large currency mismatches in the
corporate sector.

28.
Despite its strength, Chile’s financial
system remains exposed to sudden changes
in global financial conditions. An escalation
of tensions in the euro area is likely to affect
financial conditions in Chile. Staff analysis
suggests that the cost of bank funding in Chile
is positively related to measures of global
financial stress, and that both real and financial
external shocks affect Chile’s economic
performance (Box 2). Some small and mediumsized banks, which rely more heavily on
foreign financing or wholesale funding, could
be particularly affected. Nonetheless, staff
agreed with the authorities that spillovers to
European bank subsidiaries should be
contained if depositor confidence is preserved.
Foreign bank subsidiaries rely mostly on
domestic deposits for funding, and financial
links with parent banks are strictly limited by

2012 ARTICLE IV REPORT

local regulations.6 European bank subsidiaries
in Chile currently have higher ratings than their
parent banks, reflecting the strength of their
balance sheets.
29.
Staff also noted that negative
output shocks could lead to a cyclical
deterioration of credit quality. Staff argued
that a sharp global slowdown, accompanied by
sustained declines in commodity prices, will
affect Chile’s output and employment and
could push up non-performing loans. Nonbank credit card lenders also would see a rise
in defaults since they typically focus on higherrisk low-income borrowers, who are more
vulnerable to an economic slowdown.
30.
In light of these risks, staff argued
that the focus of prudential policy should
be to reduce vulnerabilities. The authorities
agreed with staff that banks should continue
to maintain high levels of liquidity and capital
to minimize the risk of contagion from an
intensification of financial tensions in the euro
area. Banks should also continue to diversify
external funding sources to reduce reliance on
a few large global financial institutions. On the
asset side, banks and non-bank creditors may
need to tighten lending standards further to
limit risk taking in the current favorable
economic environment. Staff also suggested
that supervisors should continue to monitor
carefully the rise in corporate indebtedness
and the growth of consumer loans.
31.
The authorities agreed with staff’s
characterization of financial sector risks and
6

European bank subsidiaries do not borrow from the
parent banks, and total lending to foreign related
parties (including parents) are limited by law to
25 percent of capital (secured) or 5 percent of capital
(unsecured).

with the need for continued vigilance. They
discussed similar risks in the central bank’s
Financial Stability Report (FSR) in June. At the
same time, they pointed out that banks’ strong
capital buffers should help limit potential
vulnerabilities. Stress test results, presented in
the Central Bank’s FSR suggest that capital

adequacy ratios will remain above regulatory
requirements for the large majority of banks
under a risk scenario of negative output
growth in the second half of 2012, temporary
peso depreciation, and higher short-term
interest rates.

E. Strengthening the Prudential Framework
32.
The mission welcomed the
strengthening of the institutional set up for
monitoring and managing systemic risks. In
2011, the government created a Financial
Stability Council (FSC), with a mandate to
monitor and manage systemic risks and
facilitate coordination among the supervisory
agencies, including in the area of the
supervision of financial conglomerates. The
FSC comprises the Minister of Finance and the
heads of the three financial supervisory
agencies (overseeing banks, insurance and
securities, and pensions). The central bank
Governor is not a formal member of the FSC
(because of the legal independence of the
central bank), but he attends all meetings and
participates actively in the Council’s
deliberations. The Council has initiated work
on developing methodologies to assess
stability risks related to financial
conglomerates. In addition, the authorities
have enhanced the powers of the National
Consumer Service (Sernac) in the area of
financial services, which should help
strengthen consumer protection in that area.
Finally, staff noted that the recent publication
of housing and commercial real estate price
data would allow better monitoring and
identification of risks.
33.
The authorities and staff concurred
that several legislative initiatives, currently
before Congress, would make an important

12

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

contribution to enhancing prudential
oversight. The proposed law on risk-based
supervision of insurance companies would
enhance significantly the assessment and
management of insurers’ risk and increase the
enforcement powers of supervisors. Proposed
legislation to expand the existing credit
registry to include comprehensive credit
history information from banks and non-banks
would help improve the evaluation and pricing
of credit risk. The corporate bankruptcy law
under discussion will streamline the
bankruptcy process and facilitate business
restructuring.
34.
Staff emphasized that efforts to
strengthen the financial regulatory and
supervisory framework should continue, as
recommended by the 2011 FSAP. Staff
welcomed the authorities’ plans to update the
General Banking Law and review the legal
framework for bank resolution. Given the large
presence of conglomerates in Chile’s financial
system, it will be important to establish a legal
framework for consolidated supervision. The
authorities agreed in principle, and noted that
they are making progress in this area under
the direction of the FSC. Staff noted that
strengthening the corporate governance
structure of the financial supervisory agencies
would enhance their operational
independence and improve accountability (see

CHILE

Annex IV for progress on other FSAP

2012 ARTICLE IV REPORT

recommendations).

F. Raising Productivity Growth
35.
There was agreement that raising
productivity growth remains an important
challenge. Staff noted that over the last
decade rising employment has been a key
driver of Chile’s rapid growth, however, labor
productivity growth has slowed down (see Box
3). While there is room to increase further
female and youth labor force participation
rates (which are below OECD averages), future
growth would have to rely increasingly on
productivity increases. Staff welcomed the
approval of the new poverty-reduction
program Ingreso Etico Familiar, which aims to
foster female labor participation and reward
academic achievement of children from lowincome families. Staff also commended recent
initiatives to reduce the time it takes to
incorporate a business, improve intellectual
rights protection laws, and strengthen
competition.
36.
Staff urged the authorities to persist
in their efforts to achieve consensus on
measures to increase labor market
flexibility and efficiency. In line with OECD

recommendations, staff suggested that labor
market efficiency could be enhanced by
moving away from the system of high
severance payments for workers, increasing
the flexibility of working hours, and improving
the efficiency of training programs. The
authorities agreed that it is desirable to
improve labor market efficiency, although
building consensus on specific measures has
been difficult. They are now in the process of
evaluating training programs and discussing
options to improve their effectiveness. Staff
noted that the ratio of minimum-to-average
and minimum-to-median wages is higher in
Chile than in most OECD countries, which
could hinder formal employment growth and
increase the informal sector. In addition, Chile
faces higher energy prices than most OECD
economies and neighboring countries. Staff
and the authorities agreed that high energy
prices have a negative effect on potential
output and could reduce competitiveness.
Measures to facilitate private investment in the
generation and transmission of electricity
would help increase supply and reduce prices.

STAFF APPRAISAL
37.
After two years of robust expansion,
output growth is expected to moderate to
trend levels. Real GDP is projected to grow at
4¾ percent in 2012. Private consumption
growth is moderating in line with employment
growth. Private investment is also expected to
decelerate, and import growth would converge
to the lower growth rate of domestic demand.
The external current account deficit is
projected to widen further largely due to

deteriorating terms of trade. Core and
headline inflation are expected to remain close
to the target.
38.
Chile’s key near-term challenge is to
preserve macroeconomic and financial
stability. There are substantial risks to the
outlook, stemming from heightened global
uncertainty. The key downside risks are a sharp
intensification of financial tensions in the euro

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

13

2012 ARTICLE IV REPORT

CHILE

area and the possibility of a significant
slowdown of economic activity in China
resulting in a sharp drop in commodity prices.
39.
Monetary policy should remain
responsive to changing economic
conditions. The current neutral stance is
appropriate, given the prospects of a gradual
convergence of domestic output growth
towards potential and anchored inflation
expectations. With the output gap closed and
tight labor markets, wage developments, credit
growth, and asset prices should be monitored
carefully.
40.
In case of a sharp deterioration of
financing conditions, decisive actions
should be taken to ensure orderly market
functioning. Efforts should focus on
containing liquidity pressures. A good
communication strategy would also be
important to maintain market confidence. With
anchored inflation expectations and inflation
near the target, there is ample space to ease
monetary policy, if needed. Automatic fiscal
stabilizers would also provide support,
however, discretionary fiscal stimulus should
be considered only in the case of a sharp
decline in economic activity.
41.
Exchange rate flexibility remains an
important buffer against volatile capital
flows and terms of trade shocks. It has
played an important role in limiting speculative
capital inflows and in facilitating adjustment to
large terms of trade changes. In case of
renewed capital inflow pressures,
macroeconomic policies may need to be
adjusted to limit the risk of credit and asset
price bubbles. Macroprudential policies could
also be considered to help maintain stability.
42.
Public expenditure restraint in the
remainder of 2012 would be desirable. The
14

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

withdrawal of fiscal stimulus in 2011 helped
contain overheating pressures, but the fiscal
stance was eased somewhat in 2012. Despite
the favorable cyclical conjuncture, public
expenditure growth is likely to exceed GDP
growth. It would be advisable to maintain a
tight control on fiscal spending in the
remainder of the year and allocate the savings
to increase net fiscal assets, as was done in
2011. Staff welcomes the authorities’ intention
to increase tax revenue to match the
permanent increase in education expenditure.
43.
Staff urges the authorities to
achieve structural fiscal balance by 2015,
and consider targeting a small surplus
thereafter. Maintaining strong fiscal buffers
will enhance Chile’s resilience to external
shocks, and would allow the government to
cope better with long-term fiscal challenges
related to population aging. Staff supports the
authorities’ commitment to meet their
1 percent structural fiscal deficit target by
2014. If economic conditions remain favorable,
more ambitious frontloaded deficit reduction
would be desirable.
44.
Efforts to continue strengthening
Chile’s fiscal framework are welcome. The
planed creation of a Fiscal Council would help
strengthen policy assessment and
accountability. Plans to extend the long-term
fiscal projections to include health care and
education spending also are welcome.
Discussion of other fiscal risks, including
potential pressures on the revenue side, would
also help inform policy decisions.
45.
Although financial soundness
indicators remain strong, continued
vigilance is warranted. An escalation of
financial tensions in the euro area is likely to
affect financing conditions for Chilean banks

CHILE

and corporations. To protect against this risk,
banks should maintain high levels of liquidity
and capital, and continue to diversify external
funding sources. A negative output shock
could lead to a deterioration of credit quality.
Bank and non-bank creditors may need to
tighten lending standards further to limit risk
taking in the current favorable economic
environment. The rise in debt in certain
business sectors warrants close monitoring.
46.
Staff supports the authorities’
efforts to strengthen further the prudential
framework of the financial system. The
recently established Financial Stability Council
would strengthen the monitoring and
management of systemic risk, and facilitate
coordination in times of crisis. Several current
legislative initiatives, including the law on riskbased supervision of insurance companies, the
corporate bankruptcy law, and the proposal to
expand the credit registry, would also make an
important contribution to enhancing
prudential oversight. Plans to update the
General Banking Law and review the legal
framework for bank resolution are also

2012 ARTICLE IV REPORT

welcome. As recommended by the 2011 FSAP
Update, it will be important to establish a legal
framework for consolidated supervision of
financial conglomerates.
47.
Increasing productivity growth
remains Chile’s key medium-term
challenge. Staff welcomes recent government
initiatives to foster female labor participation,
streamline business incorporation and
bankruptcy process, and strengthen
competition. Labor market flexibility could be
further enhanced by reforming high severance
pay for employees, increasing the flexibility of
working hours and the efficiency of training
programs. Chile’s relatively high ratio of
minimum-to-average wages could hinder
employment growth and contribute to growth
of the informal sector. To contain this risk,
minimum wage increases should be consistent
with productivity growth. Measures to facilitate
investment in the energy sector would help
improve the competitiveness of Chilean firms.
48.
Staff recommends that the next
Article IV consultation takes place on the
standard 12-month cycle.

Box 1. Assessment of Chile’s External Position
Chile’s real effective exchange rate (REER) has fluctuated
around its long-term average in recent years. The REER
strengthened in the mid-2000s alongside a copper price
boom. In the last two years, it has hovered around its
average value of the previous 15 years. Despite the
appreciation, Chile’s non-mining export growth over the
last decade has been relatively robust. In addition, Chile’s
world market share of agricultural and industrial exports has
remained broadly stable since 2004.

1/ An increase in the exchange rates indicates an appreciation.

Chile’s ability to maintain robust non-mining exports is
attributable to a number of factors. The structure of Chile’s
industrial exports played a role: resources-based exports
such as food and wood products account for two thirds of
Chile’s industrial exports. Chile was therefore able to avoid
competing with manufacturing powerhouses such as China.
In addition, since 2003, Chile has ratified free trade
agreement (FTA) with all of its major trading partners.

is broadly in line with fundamentals (see table). However,
the new External Balances Assessment’s current account
approach (explained in IMF’s Pilot External Sector Report, July 2012) suggests that the current account
balance is about 2 percentage points below the estimated norm under desirable policies, implying a small
overvaluation of the real exchange rate (about 7 percent). The current account deficit is driven in part by
imports related to higher investment in mining and energy, which should support future exports. More
ambitious fiscal consolidation, consistent with staff advice, would also help reduce the current account
deficit.

The macroeconomic balance (MB) approach calculates the difference between the medium term CA balance and
a CA "norm", which is a function of fundamentals (fiscal balance, old-age dependency, NFA, oil balance, real GDP
per capita, and real GDP growth). The ERER is a function of fundamentals (NFA, relative productivity differentials,
the TOT, and trade restrictions). The ES approach calculates the difference between the actual and NFA-stabilizing
CA balances. The real exchange rate adjustment will bring the CA in line with its NFA-stabilizing level.
For more detail on the CGER methodology, see Lee et al., "Exchange Rate Assessments: CGER Methodologies,"
IMF Occasional Paper No. 261, April 2008.

Looking at the financing side, the external current account deficit is financed mostly by FDI. FDI inflows are
much larger and more stable than portfolio and other investment inflows. FDI inflows are expected to
remain strong in the medium term, especially in the mining sector. Net external liabilities stood at 10
percent of GDP in 2011, relatively low compared to other emerging markets.

Box 2. Financial and Real Spillovers to Chile
As a small open economy, Chile is exposed to external shocks. Chile’s trade openness and international
financial integration are significant. Chilean banks and corporations are net borrowers in world markets, so
the cost and availability of domestic financing are affected by global factors. In addition, subsidiaries of
foreign banks account for a large share of bank assets. Staff analysis based on a vector autoregression
suggests that global financial and demand shocks, and shocks to copper prices have an important impact on
Chile’s output.

More detailed analysis shows that global financial shocks affect bank funding costs in Chile. The analysis
presented in the selected issues paper finds that interbank and bank bond spreads are highly correlated with
measures of global financial stress. Independent variables include global variables such as the composite
CDS spread of the largest European banks, VIX, foreign interbank spreads, and domestic liquidity variables.
During the Lehman crisis, the US interbank market spread explained the bulk of the movement in the
Chilean interbank spread; while the last two years, domestic bank funding costs have been positively
correlated with European bank CDS spreads and the VIX. Despite these links, spillovers from global financial
stress have been limited. In the last two years, average funding spreads have been low, at around one
percent, and bank credit growth has been very strong.

Labor productivity gains in Chile moderated over the last decade. Average annual labor productivity growth
declined from 4.8 percent in the 1990s to 1.5 percent in 2006–2011. Some of the decline is explained by
lower productivity in the mining sector related to declining ore grade. However, non-mining labor
productivity gains also declined (from 4.5 percent per year in the 1990s to 2.4 percent in the last five years).

Following the 2009 crisis, output growth has been underpinned by strong employment growth. Labor force
participation increased 4 percent per year driven by rising female participation, while employment growth
averaged 6 percent per year. After declining in 2010, labor productivity grew 1½ percent in 2011. Although
there is still room to raise female and youth participation rates which are below the OECD average, output
growth going forward will depend increasingly on productivity gains.

Raising productivity growth has been at the center of the authorities’ reform agenda. The conditional cash
transfer program for low-income families, Ingreso Ético Familiar, includes transfers conditional on
educational achievement of children as well as work-subsidies for women. In addition to increasing female
labor participation, the program would also help reduce poverty and income inequality further (recently
released data show that income inequality has declined in 2011, although it remains at a high level, with a
Gini coefficient of 0.52), The recent education reform has emphasized improved access to tertiary and preschool education. The authorities are also pressing ahead with reforms to improve intellectual property
rights and streamline procedures for business incorporation and bankruptcy. As noted by recent OECD
reports, however, there is a need to further enhance the flexibility of Chile’s labor market and improve the
quality of human capital.

2012 ARTICLE IV REPORT

ANNEX I. CHILE’S FISCAL RULE: A SHORT DESCRIPTION
Chile produces about one-third of the world’s copper. Copper exports represented 55 percent of
its goods exports (or 18 percent of GDP) in 2011, and copper revenues accounted for close to 19
percent of fiscal revenues (4¼ percent of GDP). About half of these revenues come from profits
of the state-owned mining company Codelco, and the other half comes from taxes on private
mining companies (most of which are foreign-owned).
The current structural balance rule was adopted in 2001. Its main objective is to contribute to
macroeconomic stability and fiscal sustainability by protecting public spending from the effects
of cyclical variations in copper prices and economic activity. Since there are large copper reserves
(of at least 60 years), copper is not considered an exhaustible resource; therefore concerns
related to exhaustibility have not played a role in the rule. The medium-term structural fiscal
balance target is set at the beginning of each administration, and annual targets are set in the
budget every year. The medium-term target of the current administration is 1 percent structural
deficit by 2014.
The structural balance is defined as the difference between structural revenues (consistent with
trend estimates for output and the price of copper) and public expenditure. Potential output and
the long-term copper prices, used in the calculation of non-mining and copper structural
revenues respectively, are set by independent expert committees every year.
Changes in structural fiscal copper revenues from year to year would be affected by three factors:
changes in the long-term copper price (50 cents/pound increase in the long-term price increases
structural revenues by up to 1 percentage point of GDP), changes in quantity produced, and
changes in profits (which would be affected by cost of extraction and other factors). Thus, a
significant increase in the long-term copper price could allow an increase in expenditure, while
keeping the structural balance unchanged. For example, in 2012, the structural balance is
expected to be unchanged relative to 2011, although there has been an increase in fiscal
spending of ½ percent of GDP, and a ¼ percent of GDP decline in non-mining revenue due to a
change in the corporate tax rate (these are offset by an increase in structural mining revenues
due to a rise in the long-term copper price). For that reason, the change in the non-mining
structural balance is a better indicator of the direction of fiscal policy and its economic effects
(the fiscal impulse) than the change in the overall structural balance.
For a more detailed description of the rule, see Larraín et al, 2011, “Una política fiscal de balance
estructural de segunda generación para Chile” and Daban, 2010, “Strengthening Chile’s RuleBased Fiscal Framework”, Chile: Selected Issues Paper, IMF Country Report No. 10/299.

ANNEX II. PROPOSED TAX REFORM
The reform presented to Congress by the government aims to raise tax revenue by about 0.3
percent of GDP on a permanent basis to finance higher education spending (see table). The
reform would also improve incentives to invest and provide some tax relief to low and middleincome people. In addition, it would eliminate some loopholes and exemptions.
Specifically, the proposed reform would make permanent the marginal rate of 20 percent on
corporate income. Further, the tax regime for excessive costs would be the same for joint-stock
companies (sociedades anóminas) and other types of business organizations. The tax regime
regarding transfer pricing would also be strengthened in line with international best practices.
The reform also contemplates reducing marginal personal income tax rate by 10 percent for
middle and high-income taxpayers ––except for those in the highest income bracket–– and by 15
percent for those in the lowest taxable income bracket. Additional tax relief would be provided
through an education tax credit. The rate of the financial transaction tax (stamp tax) would also
be reduced.

ANNEX III. CHILE––RISK ASSESSMENT MATRIX1
Source of Risk

Relative Likelihood2

Escalation of
financial
tensions in the
euro area

Staff assessment: MEDIUM
Further intensification of the financial
turmoil in the euro area will affect Chile
through deterioration in financial
conditions, lower export demand, and
potentially lower commodity prices.

Staff assessment: MEDIUM
A sharp escalation of the crisis would affect
the funding cost and availability of external
financing for Chilean banks and
corporations, the peso would depreciate,
and domestic activity could decelerate.
However, the impact should be moderate
since trade and bank funding dependence
on Europe is limited. In addition, Chile has
substantial policy levers to limit spillovers
and mitigate the effects on the economy.

Sharp growth
deceleration in
China

Staff assessment: LOW
A sharp growth deceleration in China
would have negative effect on world
commodity prices and on demand for
Chilean exports. The probability of this
event in the near term is low, given the
large room for policy support in China.

Staff assessment: HIGH
China is Chile's main trading partner, and
copper accounts for more than half of
Chile’s exports and about 20 percent of
government revenue. A sharp slowdown in
China’s investment growth would lead to a
drop in copper demand and prices, affecting
Chile's growth.

Heightened
volatility of
capital flows

Staff assessment: MEDIUM
In the near term, an intensification of
tensions in the euro area may increase
global risk aversion and result in
capital outflows. Moreover, the
prospect of a prolonged period of low
interest rates in advanced economies
could encourage renewed bouts of
capital flows.

Staff assessment: LOW to MEDIUM
A sudden stop or reversal of capital flows
could worsen domestic financial conditions.
Conversely, a surge in private capital inflows
could fuel credit growth, put upward
pressure on the exchange rate, and increase
the risk of asset price bubbles. As in the
past, Chile’s flexible exchange rate should
help limit the effects of speculative flows.

Impact if Realized

1

The RAM shows relatively low probability events that could materially alter the baseline path, which is the
scenario most likely to materialize in the view of staff. Staff’s subjective assessment of the relative likelihood
among those low probability events as noted in the matrix (ranging from “low” to “high”) is consistent across
different country reports prepared in a given period. The RAM reflects staff's views on the source of risks and
overall level of concerns as of the time of discussions with the authorities.

Update

Reduce information gaps,
including through a
consolidated credit registry
and standardized residential
and commercial property
price indices (M, M)

A bill was submitted to Congress in August 2011 to create a public credit bureau, which would consolidate data
provided by financial institutions (banks, retailers, insurance companies, and others). It will include both positive and
negative information for individuals and companies. It will be managed by the Superintendency of Banking and
Financial Institutions (SBIF).

Develop a strategy to
ensure adequate
replacement rate for
retirees (H, M)

Strengthen the
independence and legal
protection of regulatory
agencies (H, M)

Strengthen the enforcement
powers of securities
regulators (H, S)

The Central Bank published residential housing price data (for 2001-11) in December 2011, and commercial real estate
data in June 2012. The data compose three indices: hedonic prices, mixed adjustment, and total sales.
The 2008 Pension Reform contained several measures to address the issue of low pension and replacement rates,
including the introduction of a new solidarity pillar to prevent old-age poverty and measures to reduce the gender gap
in old-age income (e.g. division of balance in case of divorce). To increase coverage, subsidies for young workers and a
gradual mandatory participation of independent workers were introduced. These measures are relatively recent, and an
evaluation of their impact is not yet available.
More recently, the Superintendency of Pensions (SP) has developed two new methodologies to measure and forecast
replacement rates. One model uses administrative and survey data at the individual level. The other is a pension risk
model, which is used in a public web-based pension simulator that allows users to estimate their pension under
different return assumptions. There is also ongoing joint work with the OECD on computing replacement rates. These
efforts should lead to an updated assessment of replacement rates, based on which further reforms will be considered.
The Government has prepared a draft law to be submitted to Congress in 2012, which envisages improving
governance of the Superintendency for Securities and Insurance (SVS) by converting it to a Commission managed by a
five-member council, which are protected from dismissal for political reasons. It also proposes improvements to the
enforcement process and transparency (an annual report will be published and regulatory impact assessment will be
made prior issuing new regulations). The revised General Banking Law would include amendments to enhance
independence of the SBIF.
Enhancement of enforcement powers of the SVS is envisaged in the draft law mentioned above. The law would
establish Securities and Insurance Prosecutor – an autonomous body in charge of investigation and enforcement
proceedings. Sanctions will be applied by the Commission, upon conclusion of the investigation by the Prosecutor.

Update

Complete the incorporation
of Basel bank capital
standards (H, M), and
strengthen the legal
framework for bank
resolution (H, M)

The Government is working on changes to the General Banking Law to fully adopt Basel bank capital standards,
reinforce the legal framework for bank resolution, and introduce amendments to enhance independence of the
banking supervisor, in line with FSAP recommendations.

Establish legal framework to
enable the consolidated
oversight of financial
conglomerates (H, M)

The Committee of Financial Superintendents (CSSF) is developing a methodology for supervision of financial
conglomerates, including assessment of overall risks and identification of lead supervisors. The CSSF has established
formal rules for sharing information relevant for supervision and regulation. The new Financial Stability Council builds
up on the work of the CSSF. The Council is supported by three working groups: Risk Analysis, Regulation and
Legislation, and Financial Conglomerates, the latter is working on identifying key indicators of financial health for
conglomerates.
A comprehensive Funds Law that standardizes regulation in the fund industry was submitted to Congress in September
2011. In December 2011, the SVS issued regulation on internal control and risk management for securities
intermediaries, which sets minimum requirements for control and risk management. Securities intermediaries will be
required to have an Internal Audit Unit, and an internal risk management system consistent with the complexity of
operations. The senior executives will be accountable for the implementation of the internal control and risk
management. A staff’s code of conduct will also be required.
There has been no progress to date. Nonetheless, the SVS is arranging a tailor-made staff training program with the
Toronto Centre for capacity-building.

Enhance uniformity in

The SBIF and the Central Bank are also working on improvements in liquidity regulation and reporting, taking into
consideration recent proposals of the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision.

Further enhance the
AML/CFT framework (M, M)

In April 2011, the Financial Analysis Unit (UAF), SVS, SBIF, and the SP issued regulations against corruption of senior
government officials. They established criteria to define Politically Exposed Persons (PEP), and procedures for financial
intermediaries to determine the source and destination of funds of such persons. In addition, all entities supervised by
the UAF are required to register all transactions of PEP and inform of any suspicious operations. Progress has been
made on GAFISUD recommendation to require foreign subsidiaries to inform about activities carried out in countries
that are not in compliance with the set standards. In 2010-11, the UAF has issued 324 sanctions for noncompliance
with AML/CFT obligations.
There have been no changes to date.

Consider introduction of a
premium-based limited
deposit insurance system
(M, M)
Examine options to
establish a framework for
dealing with a systemic
crisis and with the potential
failure of a financial
conglomerate (M, M)

The Finance Ministry, Central Bank, and the SBIF conducted a joint crisis exercise in 2011, coordinated by Crisis
Management Analytics. The Financial Stability Council is currently reviewing lessons from the exercise, and plans to
prepare a cooperation protocol based on those lessons. In addition, there has been progress in enhancing the
supervision of conglomerates.

2012 ARTICLE IV REPORT

ANNEX V. CHILE––DEBT SUSTAINABILITY ANALYSIS
Chile’s external debt has risen in recent
years but relatively low at 40 percent of
GDP (Figure A1). Most of it is private debt,
held by non-financial companies. External
debt levels are not very sensitive to growth or
interest-rate shocks, but are somewhat
sensitive to a depreciation of the peso, as
nearly all of Chile’s external debt is
denominated in foreign currency.
Chile remained a net public creditor in
2011. Relative to GDP, net central
government assets improved from 7 percent
in 2010 to 8¾ percent in 2011. Going
forward, lower projected copper revenues
and the convergence of growth toward
potential would result in 5 percentage points
decline in net government assets by 2017.
Under the baseline scenario gross public
debt would remain relatively stable. Chile’s
gross debt-to-GDP ratio has increased

steadily since 2007, albeit from a low base.
The rise has been driven by issuance of pesodenominated instruments, while foreign
currency-denominated debt has remained
stable. The public debt sustainability analysis
suggests that debt levels would remain
comfortable under various shocks.
The government’s report on contingent
liabilities suggests that they are relatively
small. According to the 2011 report, the net
present value of contingent liabilities amount
to 3¼ percent of 2011 GDP (or 0.03 percent
of GDP on an annual flow basis), of which
deposit guarantees and guarantees on the
debt of state enterprises jointly account for
2¼ percentage points. This analysis, however,
does not include as contingent liabilities
long-term projections of government
expenditure on health care or education.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
September 11, 2012

International Monetary Fund
700 19th Street, NW
Washington, D. C. 20431 USA

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2012 Article IV Consultation with Chile
On September 5, 2012, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF)
concluded the Article IV consultation with Chile. 1
Background
Chile’s economy has expanded at a robust pace over the past two years. The economy
recovered rapidly from the global financial crisis and the February 2010 earthquake, supported
by a strong policy framework, favorable copper prices and strong consumer and business
confidence. Real GDP increased by about 6 percent during 2010–11 on the back of
exceptionally dynamic domestic demand.
The output gap is closed and some pressures on capacity constraints have emerged. The
unemployment rate is at a historically low level, leading to strong wage growth. Labor force
participation and employment have increased rapidly in 2010–11, although there has been
some deceleration in recent months. The surge in domestic demand has fueled import growth,
turning the external current account into deficit in 2011, despite record high copper prices. Core
and headline inflation increased rapidly in 2011 driven by rising import prices and wages. Price
pressures have eased in recent months as food and energy prices declined, and inflation
expectations remain well anchored.
Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On
return to Headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the
Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the
Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the
country's authorities. An explanation of any qualifiers used in summings up can be found here:
http://www.imf.org/external/np/sec/misc/qualifiers.htm.
1

2
Bank credit growth has been strong, despite some tightening in credit standards since late
2011. Bank credit in real terms has been growing at around 11 percent year-on-year, with
particularly strong growth in the corporate and consumer loans segments. In contrast, non-bank
consumer credit, which accounts for about 30 percent of consumer credit, has declined since
mid-2011.
The central bank raised the policy rate by 475 basis points from mid-2010 to June 2011
(to 5¼ percent) to withdraw policy stimulus and contain inflation. After a one-off easing in
January 2012, amid uncertain global financial conditions, the policy rate has been maintained at
5 percent. The central bank completed the pre-announced US$12 billion foreign exchange
purchases program in December 2011, strengthening the reserve position.
Spillovers to Chile from volatility in global financial markets have been limited. Stock market
prices have moved broadly in line with prices in other emerging markets. Despite some increase
since mid-2011, bank funding costs remain well below their levels after the Lehman crisis. The
temporary liquidity measures implemented by the authorities in December 2011 were
successful in containing a rise in liquidity pressures in domestic money markets. Net capital
inflows have remained strong, especially in the mining sector. The real effective exchange rate
is close to its long-term historical average.
The withdrawal of fiscal stimulus continued in 2011. Public expenditure growth slowed down
and a temporary corporate income tax hike boosted revenue. However, an increase in
education and other social spending will result in some easing of the fiscal policy stance in
2012. A tax reform has been proposed by the government to help finance the increase in
education spending.
Looking ahead, real GDP is expected to grow 4¾ percent in 2012, broadly in line with potential
growth. The current account deficit is expected to widen further in 2012 due to less favorable
terms of trade. Core and headline inflation are expected to remain close to the target as
domestic demand growth moderates and import prices remain subdued.
Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors commended the authorities’ skillful economic management anchored on
sound policy frameworks, which has contributed to robust economic growth with low inflation,
unemployment, and public debt. Directors underscored, however, that downside risks remain,
stemming from global uncertainties and Chile’s vulnerability to commodity price shocks. They
called for continued vigilance and maintenance of strong and flexible policy frameworks. They
were encouraged that the authorities have space for counter-cyclical policies if needed,
particularly on the monetary side.

3
Directors supported the authorities’ plans to reduce the structural budget deficit to one percent
of GDP by 2014, with a number of Directors observing that the aim eventually should be
structural balance or a small surplus. Near-term flexibility should be retained, however, and a
more front-loaded reduction would be desirable if conditions remain favorable. Directors
encouraged the authorities to build up fiscal buffers and strengthen the medium-term fiscal
framework further. Expenditure restraint and higher revenue collection will be essential. New
spending commitments, including higher social spending, should be matched by permanent
revenue increases. In this context, the tax reform to finance education expenditure is welcome.
Directors welcomed plans to create a Fiscal Council and broaden the expenditure forecasting
framework to include health care and education spending.
Directors observed that the inflation targeting and flexible exchange rate regimes have served
Chile well. They agreed that the current neutral stance of monetary policy is appropriate but
should remain responsive to changing economic conditions. Exchange rate flexibility, buttressed
by macro-prudential measures as needed and a good communication strategy to maintain
market confidence, remains an important buffer and first line of defense against volatile capital
flows and terms of trade shocks.
Directors welcomed the soundness and resilience of Chile’s financial sector, noting that banks
are well-capitalized, liquid, and profitable, a testimony to the authorities’ strong financial
oversight. Given global uncertainties, banks should maintain adequate liquidity and capital and
continue to diversify external funding sources. Directors encouraged the authorities to
implement the remaining reforms recommended in the 2011 FSAP report to enhance financial
regulation and supervision. In this connection, they welcomed the establishment of a Financial
Stability Council and various legislative initiatives being pursued, and recommended the
creation of a legal framework for consolidated supervision of financial conglomerates.
Directors saw productivity growth as key to sustaining high economic growth rates in the future.
They welcomed recent initiatives to foster female labor participation, and pressed for reforms to
enhance labor market efficiency and flexibility, boost investment in the energy sector, and
improve the business environment.

Public Information Notices (PINs) form part of the IMF's efforts to promote transparency of the IMF's
views and analysis of economic developments and policies. With the consent of the country
(or countries) concerned, PINs are issued after Executive Board discussions of Article IV consultations
with member countries, of its surveillance of developments at the regional level, of post-program
monitoring, and of ex post assessments of member countries with longer-term program engagements.
PINs are also issued after Executive Board discussions of general policy matters, unless otherwise
decided by the Executive Board in a particular case. The staff report (use the free Adobe Acrobat

Statement by Pablo Garcia-Silva, Executive Director for Chile
September 5, 2012
On behalf of my Chilean authorities, I would like to thank the staff for a well-written set of
papers on the Chilean economy. The Article IV report adequately presents the constructive
tone of the dialogue between my authorities and the staff during the consultation process, and
is a good reflection of the collaborative relationship between Chile and the Fund. As a small
and highly integrated economy, Chile has significant stakes on an environment that promotes
a well-functioning global economy. My authorities see their productive engagement with the
Fund as part of their contribution to that environment.
Background
The Chilean economy quickly recovered from the 2009 recession and February 2010
earthquake, posting above-trend growth of 6.1 percent over 2010 and 2011. Thus, the output
gap has closed, whilst the unemployment rate has fallen below pre-crisis levels. The
significant monetary and fiscal stimulus put in place in 2009 was timely withdrawn as the
economy picked up speed, forestalling the emergence of domestic imbalances or financial
tensions. Thus, the economy is in a healthy position to face the lingering risks from a still
uncertain global environment.
The financial turbulences associated with sovereign tensions in the Eurozone over the second
half of 2011 had a limited impact on the Chilean economy. A slight dip in household and
business confidence, as well as a limited impact on equities, did not manage to significantly
dent the growth in domestic demand and output. In 2012, the economy has continued to
expand robustly, at 5.4 percent in the first half of the year. In spite of this dynamism, there
are signs of a deceleration towards trend-like rates of expansion for the whole of 2012.
Underlying these domestic factors, the softening of global conditions in 2012, due to the
international financial situation, is expected to exert a moderating influence on Chile’s
economy. This is consistent with commodity prices having shifted back from their early-year
highs, and the expected reduction in Chile’s terms of trade in 2012.
The overall normalization of the business cycle, and the appropriate policy responses by the
authorities, has prevented a significant resurgence of inflationary pressures. The high
headline inflation by the end of 2011, close to 4 percent, was mostly driven by external
factors, namely the depreciation of the exchange rate in response to international turbulences,
as well as high food and energy prices. However, core inflation remained subdued. More
recently, the reduction in international fuel prices, as well as the strength of the peso, has
contributed to modest inflation prints. The private sector, as well as the authorities, now
expects that headline inflation will fall below 3 percent by the end of this year.

2
Although labor productivity growth decelerated over the last ten years, it has recently picked
up, in the first half of this year to over 3 percent, which is similar to pre-2008 prints. This
gives confidence that expected trend growth should remain around 5 percent. The recent
results of the independent committee of experts for the design of fiscal policy are also
consistent with these figures for trend growth.
Monetary Policy
The Banco Central de Chile (BCC) conducts its monetary policy under an Inflation-Targeting
scheme and a flexible exchange rate regime. This framework has served the economy well,
both to confront the disinflationary and negative output implications of the 2009 recession,
and to properly forestall the emergence of imbalances in the subsequent vigorous recovery.
After reaching the zero lower bound and the implementation of non-conventional monetary
policy stimulus in 2009, the BCC’s policy rate currently stands at 5 percent, broadly
considered a neutral stance.
The BCC continues to perceive that two main risks dominate the Chilean outlook going
forward. On the one hand, the external backdrop remains a significant concern to the
authorities. A disorderly and costly resolution of the sovereign tensions in the Eurozone,
excessive fiscal retrenchment in the US, or a significant slowdown in China, all could have
severe financial and real effects on Chile. On the other hand, the resilience of the domestic
drivers of growth has not generated imbalances and tensions so far, but over the medium
term, the inflationary risks of a buoyant demand-driven growth process remain present, in the
context of easy global monetary conditions and high commodity prices. The authorities have
been clear to point out that even though current developments have shown a limited impact
of external tensions, and low headline inflation prints, monetary policy will remain vigilant
to confront risks, were they to materialize, so as to prevent the unhinging of the inflationary
process.
Fiscal Policy
In the context of the fiscal rule in place since 2001, public spending is set so as to achieve the
authorities’ target for a given structural balance. At the beginning of the current
administration, in 2010, and in accordance with the Fiscal Sustainability Act, the authorities
defined their fiscal policy in order to achieve a structural deficit of 1 percent of GDP by 2014,
balancing the needs for a sound fiscal stance with the social priorities and policy challenges
Chile faces on the path to economic development. Moreover, this fiscal objective was
consistent with a significant withdrawal of the large fiscal stimulus program of 2009, which
widened the structural deficit to 3 percent of GDP that year. Fiscal policy restraint, in the
context of increasing structural revenues, allowed the authorities to already reach the target in
2011, with a structural deficit of 1.1 percent instead of the 1.5 foreseen one year earlier, thus
implementing a structural improvement in the fiscal balance of close to 2 percent of GDP in

3
two years. The overall fiscal balance posted a significant surplus in 2011, has shown so far in
2012 a surplus of 2 percent of GDP, and is expected to remain close to balance for the year as
a whole. Moreover, public spending has grown in 2012 close to overall GDP. The authorities
see this as consistent with their policy commitments and the low level of gross public debt,
whereas the lingering risks from abroad make a rapid slowdown in public spending
unadvisable.
The authorities are aware of the significant risks stemming from the global environment, and
thus appropriately value the importance of sound fiscal policy design and implementation.
Although the current policy framework in place in Chile tasks monetary policy with the first
line of defense in the case of a significant deterioration of the outlook, fiscal policy is also
ready to act should the risks of a marked downgrade in output and employment prospects
materialize. The authorities have put in place contingencies to face such an occurrence, and
recognize that the existing fiscal buffers provide room for maneuver in such a circumstance.
So far, however, the authorities have not activated the contingency plan, as the spillovers
from the sovereign crisis in the Eurozone have been limited.
Total assets held in cash and the sovereign wealth funds by the Treasury reach close to
USD34 billion as of mid 2012, and the public sector remains a net creditor, with net debt
below minus 8 percent of GDP. This aspect suggests that the external and public debt
sustainability analysis should result in even more comfortable assessments than those
presented in the staff papers. Going forward, the authorities consider that it would be
appropriate to include in sustainability analyses not only gross measures, but also net levels
of public debt, particularly when assets are liquid and are held for macrofinancial
stabilization purposes.
Financial Sector Issues
The authorities view a sound macroeconomic policy framework as necessary but not
sufficient to forestall financial instability. Firm financial regulation and supervision are also
critical. The current regulatory infrastructure helped limit the financial damage from the
2008-2009 global financial crisis and recession, and thus households and corporates, both
financial and non-financial, were well placed to benefit from the stimulative policies put in
place in 2009.
The subsequent expansion of credit has been moderate, and driven most recently by banks.
Household leverage, as measured by, for instance, debt-to-income ratios, has also remained
within stable levels. In any case, non-performing loans have edged up somewhat higher from
the low levels observed in 2010, which is consistent with the more cautious approach taken
by credit originators noted earlier, as well as with a moderate increase in credit spreads for
smaller-sized loans. Overall, the authorities view these developments as an adequate

4
adjustment of the credit market to an environment that is less conducive to high rates of
growth, such as the ones observed in 2010 and 2011.
Corporate debt also continues to expand at a moderate pace, with only a third through
external indebtedness. Moreover, the issuance of external debt has been geared towards
longer tenors and mostly for the financing of foreign direct investment. It should be noted
that given the structure of the corporate sector in Chile, a significant part of corporate
external debt has been issued either by exporting firms, or by foreign-owned large companies
in the utility sector and is held by the parent company abroad. The balance sheets of smaller
companies, which depend on local banking sources for their funding, have remained healthy.
The presence of foreign-owned banks in Chile, under a subsidiary model with mostly local
funding, has been a positive development on a number of fronts. The strong capital and
liquidity buffers of the banking sector are also particularly seen in the foreign-owned
segment of the market, and the deleveraging efforts of the parent companies have not had a
material impact locally.
A number of initiatives are, in any case, in place to bolster the regulatory and supervisory
infrastructure. The overall financial stability oversight has been entrusted to the Financial
Stability Council (FSC), composed of the Minister of Finance, the three supervisory agencies
(banks, securities exchange and insurance, pensions) and the BCC governor. The FSC has
undertaken work to identify sources of systemic risk and lay out the groundwork for
consolidated supervision, among other tasks. Although the authorities recognize that the
current legal framework for supervision allows a significant degree of cooperation and
information sharing, some legal changes would be required, and they appreciate the FSAP
recommendations on this area.
The External Accounts and the Policy Framework
The improvement of the external environment by the middle of last decade resulted in a rapid
and significant increase in commodity prices. A particular feature has been the sharp increase
in the share of China in world copper demand. However, given the high volatility and mean
reverting properties of copper prices, it was appropriate for these income surges to be
perceived as transitory by both the public sector and the private export companies. The
natural implication of the higher mineral prices was therefore an increase in national savings,
without an equivalent increase in domestic investment, and thus a significant shift in the
current account balance towards a surplus during the second half of the last decade.
However, after the resilience displayed by commodity prices in general (and copper prices in
particular) during the 2009 global recession, perceptions have shifted, and a significant part
of the higher commodity prices is now perceived as persistent. On the investment side, we
have seen a significant surge in copper mining investment, both on the private and public

5
side, whilst the operation of the expert’s assessment within the fiscal rule on long-run copper
price trends has resulted in a relevant increase in the public sector’s structural income. The
Chilean authorities still see that commodity prices are an important determinant of the
external vulnerability of the Chilean economy, and thus should be monitored closely along
with their implications for the balance of payments. The appearance of a current account
deficit, after several years of surpluses, is however part of an adjustment process to a new
scenario of high commodity prices and the subsequent higher investment in mining.
Moreover, the bulk of the financing of the current account deficit has occurred through FDI.
Proper consideration of these country-specific circumstances is difficult to include in the
cross-country assessment of external balances, such as the CGER and EBA. The staff should
strive, nevertheless, to include adequate qualifications where needed.
The shift towards a neutral monetary policy stance, after several years of low interest rates,
and the lower interest rates in some large emerging economies, has reduced the attractiveness
of the Chilean peso as a funding currency for carry trade operations. This, coupled with the
positive domestic growth prospects going forward, may enhance the attractiveness of Chile
as a recipient of capital inflows, either by residents or non-residents. Proper note should be
given to some of the implications of the high degree of financial integration of the Chilean
economy, particularly the large holdings of foreign assets by local institutional investors.
These have helped smooth the fluctuations of local financial markets, as investment decisions
have resulted in stabilizing capital inflows in times of international turmoil.
The authorities recognize the challenges the current external conditions could pose for
Chile’s macrofinancial stability. They consider that the current policy framework, based on a
set of rules for the conduct of monetary and fiscal policy, along with a flexible exchange rate
and strong financial supervision and regulation, provide an appropriate set of tools to
successfully deal with emerging risks. The authorities welcome the staff’s advice on such
issues, and look forward to a continued fruitful engagement with the Fund.
