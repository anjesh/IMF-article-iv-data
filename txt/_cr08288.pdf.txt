REPUBLIC OF KAZAKHSTAN
Staff Report for the 2008 Article IV Consultation
Prepared by Staff Representatives for the
2008 Consultation with the Republic of Kazakhstan
Approved by David Owen and Martin Fetherston
June 16, 2008

Executive Summary
Kazakhstan has been significantly affected by the global financial market turmoil
that began last summer. Banks have lost access to new external financing, credit
extension has stalled, growth has slowed, and risks to the outlook are on the downside.
Nevertheless, Kazakhstan has considerable public financial resources to help it weather the
current situation and the country is benefiting from high oil and commodity prices.
Medium-term growth prospects remain favorable.
Policies should focus on managing risks to the outlook and setting the stage for a
resumption of strong and sustained growth. Monetary, fiscal, and financial sector
policies should all move toward achieving these objectives.
Strengthening the banking system is essential. A realistic assessment of the health of the
banks needs to be made and steps taken to mitigate risks, including by bolstering capital
bases, strengthening bank supervision, and further developing the financial safety net
framework. The authorities are moving in this direction. They are considering a number of
changes to the banking law, and the FSA has stepped up its supervision of banks.
Exchange rate stability is a key policy objective at present. This is important to
maintain depositor confidence, limit the risks from the large foreign currency exposure of
the corporate sector, and help reduce inflation. When conditions in financial markets
improve, a return to a more flexible exchange rate policy would be desirable. Given its
limited movement against the U.S. dollar since October, the tenge exchange rate has been
reclassified as a de facto conventional peg. There is no clear evidence of over or
undervaluation of the real exchange rate.
Macroeconomic policies should remain supportive of growth. Inflation pressures are
beginning to ease, and the current monetary policy stance is appropriate for now. Staff
recommends that the automatic fiscal stabilizers be allowed to operate, and see room for a
discretionary fiscal stimulus package if growth slows more sharply than expected.

I. RECENT DEVELOPMENTS, OUTLOOK, AND RISKS
1.
At the time of the 2007 Article IV consultation, Kazakhstan’s economy was
enjoying an extended period of very rapid growth. Between 2001 and 2007, real GDP
growth averaged 10 percent annually, underpinned by the development of the oil sector,
generally prudent macroeconomic policies, structural reforms, and increased access to global
financial markets. As a result of this strong growth, real per capita incomes have doubled
since 2000 and social indicators have improved.
2.
The banking sector played a central role in this rapid growth. Banks dominate the
financial system in Kazakhstan, accounting for 80 percent of total assets. They are mostly
locally and privately owned, although foreign participation has increased recently. The
system is highly concentrated, with the largest five banks accounting for 78 percent of
market share. Banks are very reliant on external financing, with external liabilities making up
about 45 percent of the aggregate balance sheet. Easy access to external funding fueled very
rapid domestic credit growth, which expanded at an annual average rate of 70 percent from
end-2004 to August 2007, bringing bank credit to around 75 percent of GDP by end-2007.
Lending was mainly to the household, trade, and construction sectors (the oil sector is not
reliant on domestic banks for its financing).

3.
The economic situation in Kazakhstan has changed significantly since the onset
of the global financial turmoil last summer (Tables 1–4). Market perceptions of risk on
Kazakhstan’s assets rose sharply in September and, despite a substantial decline over the past
month, remain elevated (Figure 1). Commercial bank access to external funding has been
sharply reduced. Banks have been repaying syndicated loans and Eurobond issues as they
have come due, while raising new financing through nonresident deposits, private loan
replacements, government agency-guaranteed loans, and to some extent liquidating their own

foreign assets. Some of this borrowing is

In response to the tightening of liquidity conditions, banks have sharply
curtailed their lending, and growth and property prices are weakening. There has been
no growth in bank lending since August, and this “credit crunch” is affecting the nonoil
economy. Real GDP growth slowed to 6 percent (y/y) in the first quarter of 2008, from
8.9 percent (y/y) in the third quarter of 2007, and recent indicators of manufacturing and
construction activity suggest that the nonoil economy remained weak into the second quarter
(Figure 3). After several years of rapid gains, property prices are declining, most notably in
Almaty where the prices of existing homes are down by 40 percent from their peak. This
decline has partly corrected previous overvaluation, although the price adjustment may have
further to go, particularly if credit availability and household incomes continue to weaken.
Developments in Kazakhstan have also had repercussions in the region (Box 1).

Box 1. Regional Linkages and Spillovers
Kazakhstan is becoming a more important player in central Asia. The primary channels linking the region’s
economies are trade, workers’ remittances, and cross-border banking. The temporary ban on wheat exports in
2008 and the difficulties experienced by banks highlight the impact of policies and developments in Kazakhstan
on the region.
Kazakhstani banks expanded rapidly in neighboring markets in recent years. The presence of Kazakhstani
banks has become particularly notable in the Kyrgyz Republic, where they accounted for 48 percent of total
lending in September 2007. The credit crunch led Kazakhstani banks to squeeze branches and subsidiaries
abroad to shore up liquidity, causing a slowdown in credit extension in the Kyrgyz Republic. Credit growth has
recovered in 2008 and the share of Kazakhstani banks’ credit has stabilized at 45 percent of total. In Tajikistan,
one Kazakhstani bank in particular has lent a significant sum to the cotton sector, which is secured by Tajik
central bank reserves. This makes Tajikistan vulnerable to any problems at this bank (although the exposure is
low from the bank’s perspective). Finally, Kazakhstani banks’ activities in Russia have been growing; while
this helps them to diversify their balance sheets, it exposes them to new risks.
The slowdown in Kazakhstan is having a noticeable impact on some neighbors. The country is an important
net importer from the CIS and a source of remittances, particularly for the Kyrgyz Republic (although little is
captured in official data). All-in-all, growth in the Kyrgyz Republic (excluding gold) and Tajikistan is projected
to slow to 5 percent this year, from 8.7 percent and 7.8 respectively in 2007.

Financial soundness indicators
are showing signs of deterioration
(Table 5). While capital adequacy is well
above the regulatory minimum, falling
liquidity ratios and deteriorating asset
quality do raise concern, with the number
of loans overdue by more than seven
days rising sharply in recent months. 1
Banks are heavily exposed to the
deteriorating property market, face
indirect exchange rate risk from lending
in foreign currency, and have further
large external debt repayments coming
due. The authorities estimate that the
maturing external liabilities of banks in
2008 total $14 billion ($17 billion with
interest), including repos and short-term
deposits of nonresidents, and repayments
are estimated to have been the highest in
the first quarter.

6.
The authorities reacted
decisively to the sudden stop in capital
inflows last year. The central bank (NBK) provided large-scale liquidity support to banks
during August–October through repurchase agreements, foreign exchange swaps, early
redemption of NBK notes, and the easing of reserve requirements. It also intervened heavily
in the foreign exchange market, using $6 billion (25 percent) of its reserves (15 percent of
total official foreign currency assets) during August–October, and has since effectively
pegged the tenge to the U.S. dollar. NBK reserves have recovered this year, rising by
$4 billion through early June. The government directed $1 billion to support ongoing
construction and investment projects in November 2007 (another $3 billion is slated for this
year, although only $130 million is additional spending). After initially spiking, interbank
interest rates have eased (Figure 2).

1

Loan classification in Kazakhstan is based on a complex scoring system that classifies loans as "Standard,"
"Doubtful," and "Loss." "Doubtful" in turn is divided into five categories. The text chart and Table 5 show two
measures of problem loans. "NPLs narrow" comprise the "Doubtful 5" plus "Loss" categories and include loans
overdue by 60 days or more, and loans that are still performing, but where the obligor is deemed "weak" or
"failing" (see also FitchRatings, April 2008). “NPLs broad” comprise categories "Doubtful 2, 4, 5, and Loss,"
and capture loans overdue by seven days or more, as well as those described above.

7
7.
Kazakhstan has large financial
resources to help weather the current
situation. Official foreign currency assets
totaled $46 billion in early June, comprising
NBK reserves of $21 billion and oil fund
(NFRK) assets of $25 billion. Commercial
banks also have foreign assets of which about
$3.5 billion are thought to be liquid. Total
foreign assets broadly match foreign
liabilities when the intracompany debt of the
oil sector is excluded, while liquid foreign
currency assets comfortably cover potential
short-term foreign currency drains.

following the large deficit last year, due to
higher oil and commodity prices and much slower import growth (Table 2 and Figure 5).
With banks repaying debt, the external debt/GDP ratio is projected to fall sharply this year,
and appears to be on a sustainable path under a range of scenarios (Table 6 and Figure 6).
After surging late last year, CPI inflation has eased on a month-to-month basis this year, and
in the absence of further oil or food price shocks, is expected to fall below 10 percent (y/y)
by year-end, from 19.5 percent at present. Despite a weakening in nonoil tax revenues, the

further, NPLs would jump, and bank capital
ratios would decline. NPLs would increase more if the exchange rate depreciated given the
unhedged foreign currency exposure in the nonoil corporate sector.
II. POLICY ISSUES AND VIEWS OF THE AUTHORITIES
10.
The discussions focused on policies needed to manage the current risks to the
outlook and set the stage for a resumption of strong growth and low inflation. The
authorities’ views on the economic outlook are broadly similar to those of Fund staff, with
the government and NBK both expecting real GDP growth of around 5 percent this year. The
authorities recognize that the pace of expansion in recent years was unsustainable, and
policies are now focused on managing a smooth transition to a sustainable growth path with
priorities being to return inflation to single digit rates, strengthen the banking sector, and
maintain fiscal discipline.
A. Banking Sector Policies
11.
The authorities are confident that the banks will be able to weather the current
pressures they face. The FSA pointed out that banks are well-capitalized, and that while
rising, NPLs still remain low. Nevertheless, the supervisors are working to reduce the
vulnerabilities facing the banks, and they welcomed the input from the Financial Sector
Assessment Program (FSAP) Update in this regard (see text table on the following page for a
list of the key FSAP recommendations). The FSA noted that the increase in recorded offbalance sheet items since the beginning of last year is largely due to a higher volume of

3

A sharp decline in oil prices would have a substantial impact on the current account and budget balances. With
oil prices at $50 a barrel, staff calculations suggest the current account would be in a deficit of 7¼ percent of
GDP and the budget in a deficit of 1 percent of GDP in 2008.

Longer-term

• Bring bank restructuring/resolution
framework into line with best practices.
• Improve capital market infrastructure to
allow collateral-based money market
transactions in an internationally
compatible manner.
• Improve consolidated supervison,
including cross-border supervision.

• Assess the state of laws, regulations,
and market infrastructure for a

• Facilitate OTC markets to help
develop and introduce products and
techniques;
• Extend role of Kazakhstan Mortgage

10
payment guarantees (linked to the rapid lending growth in the first half of 2007). Banks are
required to provision against the contingent liabilities they face, and their exposure to
financial derivative transactions is minimal (less than 1 percent of assets).
12.
The FSA has intensified its supervision of the banks in recent months and
changes are also in train to strengthen the regulatory framework. Onsite inspections of
the largest banks have been stepped up, and FSA representatives have been installed at each
of the large banks to increase contacts with bank management and more closely monitor bank
operations. The FSA is also strengthening its stress testing and early warning system
methodologies, in close cooperation with the NBK. To support these endeavors, the
government has committed to significantly increase the resources of the agency, and the FSA
hopes it will now be able to recruit and retain more experienced staff. Regulatory changes are
being made to tighten limits on foreign borrowing (as a function of capital) and more closely
monitor bank liquidity.
13.
The authorities are continuing to develop their financial safety net framework
across a number of dimensions. A Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) on Financial
Stability, which has been signed by the government, the National Bank of Kazakhstan (NBK)
and the Financial Supervision Agency (FSA), sets out the framework for cooperation in
periods of financial stress. The NBK has established a framework for liquidity support for
“financial stability purposes” under the MoU. In addition to the NBK’s refinance window,
the banks that have signed a “Memorandum of Cooperation and Interaction on Financial
Stability” have access to exceptional liquidity support from the NBK (but must agree to
certain conditions on their activities, including limits on foreign claims and liabilities). The
NBK has also expanded the list of collateral it accepts at its refinance window, and has
increased the capital of the deposit insurance fund, although it acknowledges that the fund
would only be sufficient to cover deposits in the event of small banks failing. 4 To help
manage financial difficulties at a bank, changes in the banking law are also being considered.
These changes would increase the authorities’ ability to react quickly to adverse
developments in a bank’s financial position, including through public capital injections
(under the current legislation, the government can only inject capital into a bank when its
capital ratio is below zero).

4

The limit on individual deposit insurance is currently T 700,000 ($5,800 or about 85 percent of per capita
income), a level that covers about 90 percent of household depositors.

11
B. Exchange Rate and Monetary Policy
14.
Exchange rate stability is a central policy objective of the NBK. At present,
exchange rate stability is viewed as essential for maintaining depositor confidence, limiting
the risks from the large foreign currency exposure of the corporate sector, and helping reduce
inflation. The central bank noted that
downward pressures on the exchange rate

2007 (Box 2). Intervention in the foreign
exchange market has been substantially scaled back (as a share of total transactions) in recent
months, although the NBK stands ready to intervene in the market if downward pressures on
the exchange rate re-emerge. The authorities continue to view the exchange rate regime as a
“managed float with no predetermined path for the exchange rate.”
15.
The authorities place a high priority on reducing inflation. The central bank
raised its policy rate from 9 to 11 percent last December to help contain inflationary
pressures, but has recently cut the reserve requirement on foreign liabilities (to 6 percent
from 8 percent) to help bank liquidity. The current policy stance is seen as appropriate to
balance a number of policy goals—preserving financial stability, cushioning downside risks
to growth, and ensuring that inflation is on a firm downward path. The authorities have also
implemented a ban on wheat and vegetable oil exports until September and October,
respectively, in an effort to contain food prices and ensure sufficient reserves for domestic
consumption (wheat exports to the Kyrgyz Republic are exempt). The NBK agreed with staff
that weaker growth will likely help reduce inflation pressures in the coming months, but
emphasized that it would be closely monitoring developments and would adjust its policy
stance as needed. The NBK sees changes in its policy interest rate as an increasingly
effective monetary policy instrument, although the exchange rate remains a very important
tool for affecting economic outcomes (Box 3).

The majority of tax revenues from the oil sector are paid to the government in tenge. These tenge revenues are
then deposited with the NFRK and invested in foreign currency instruments. At present, the central bank, which
manages the NFRK assets, has a six-month window in which to make the conversion from tenge to foreign
currency.

Box 2. Optimal Reserve Measures for Kazakhstan
Based on traditional “rule of thumb” measures, Kazakhstan’s reserves are comfortable (Figure 1). Recent
research, however, has focused on the insurance motive for maintaining reserves. Jeanne (2007) develops a model in
which the optimal level of reserves is determined by weighing the benefits of reserves––the reduced likelihood of a
sudden stop and smoothed consumption during a crisis––against the opportunity cost of higher returns on less liquid
assets. The probability of a sudden stop for emerging markets is estimated at about 10 percent from cross-country
models, but for Kazakhstan this probability went up significantly with the onset of the global financial turmoil. In
Figure 2, Jeanne’s model has been calibrated for Kazakhstan for two different probabilities of a sudden stop, 10 and
100 percent.
NBK reserves were above their optimal level in early 2007, giving the central bank considerable scope to
intervene in the foreign exchange market to cushion the impact of the sudden stop. The decline in reserves
since last summer, however, means than NBK reserves are now below their optimal level, although total official
foreign currency assets (including NFRK) are still very comfortable.

C. Fiscal Policy and Other Issues
16.
During the discussions, the government stated its intention to meet its 2008
budget targets despite the slowing economy. Based on first quarter data, the authorities
were anticipating a shortfall in revenues in 2008 of about T 200 billion (1.2 percent of GDP)
relative to budget (the budget is based on a lower oil price assumption than assumed by the
staff). They therefore intended to take offsetting measures, including freezing “nonpriority”
spending (about T 84 billion) and introducing new revenue measures (see below).
Subsequent to the mission, however, the government announced a supplementary budget that
raised spending on wages and pensions and will result in a somewhat reduced fiscal surplus
this year (relative to budget) of around ¾ percent of GDP.
17.
The government is preparing new tax and budget codes to bring public finances
more into line with development priorities. The objectives of the tax reform are to shift the

Box 3. The Monetary Transmission Mechanism in Kazakhstan
To look at channels of monetary transmission in Kazakhstan, a VAR model was run on seasonally
adjusted monthly data (2000:1-2008:1). The variables included (in the order listed) are manufacturing
production (a proxy for nonoil output), the consumer price index, the interest rate on NBK notes, private
credit, and the dollar/tenge exchange rate. The exogenous variables are oil prices and the Federal Funds rate.1
The results suggest that both the interest rate and exchange rate channels are important. An exchange
rate depreciation has a positive impact on the CPI and a negative effect on credit and output (although the
latter is not statistically significant). An increase in interest rates has a negative impact on output and credit;
the impact on inflation is incorrectly signed, but not statistically significant. To give an idea of the orders of
magnitude, a 1 percentage point increase in the interest rate and a 5 percent depreciation of the exchange rate
both reduce manufacturing output by about 2–2¼ percent in the short term.

burden of taxation more onto the subsoil and raw materials sectors to promote diversification
of the economy and to simplify the tax system. As part of this initiative, the government
recently imposed duties on crude oil exports that could raise T 120 billion in 2008. They are
also considering imposing duties on other raw material exports in the near future. Other
changes include a cut in the corporate tax rate and a further reduction in the VAT rate to
12 percent in 2009. It is hoped that the new tax code will be finalized by year-end. The
authorities have also been working with the World Bank to develop a new budget code to
improve the budget process and increase expenditure efficiency.

14
18.
The NFRK continues to be managed prudently, and the government does not
expect to draw on the Fund beyond the amount of the guaranteed annual transfer to the
budget. 6 The assets of NFRK consist of a stabilization portfolio of about $5 billion (invested
in short-term debt securities) and an investment portfolio (invested in longer-term debt and
equity securities). While the NFRK fulfils both a stabilization and savings role, at present the
government has no intention to use the Fund’s assets to help cushion the downturn. Indeed,
the government spent only 86 percent of the guaranteed transfer from the NFRK last year,
and expects the mandated transfer to be adequate to meet spending needs this year.
19.

The authorities provided information about progress in the following areas:

•

Trade policy: The government has been engaged in intensive negotiations for WTO
accession, and bilateral discussions have been concluded with 20 countries. While
discussions for access to Kazakhstan for industrial goods from the United States have
been completed, and are close to completion for the EU, further progress in other
areas has been slowed by what the government sees as unreasonable demands from
some bilateral partners.

•

The EITI initiative. Kazakhstan is a member of the international EITI Board and has
acquired the status of a candidate country for EITI implementation. The first national
report on budget revenues and payments was published in February. The authorities
are working to obtain the participation of all subsoil companies operating in the
country; at present, companies accounting for 90 percent of the total volume of oil
and gas extraction are participating.

•

AML/CFT legislation. The draft bill on AML/CFT that was headed to parliament in
2007 is now undergoing amendments to bring it into closer compliance with
international AML/CFT standards. The government hopes to complete the revisions
and secure the passage of the law by year-end.
III. STAFF APPRAISAL

20.
The current economic climate is challenging, but Kazakhstan has considerable
financial resources to help it weather the situation, and medium-term growth prospects
remain favorable. The policy response of the authorities to the drying-up of external
financing has so far been broadly appropriate, and policies should continue to focus on
managing risks to the outlook and setting the stage for a resumption of strong and sustained
growth.
6

Guaranteed transfers from the NFRK only finance spending on the Development Budget. The size of the
transfer is established by a legislative act, and is determined by a formula based on a constant amount plus a
portion of the previous stock of NFRK assets. The guaranteed transfer in 2008 is T 461.4 billion (2.6 percent of
GDP).

15
21.
The health of the banking sector is central to the outlook. NPLs are expected to
continue rising, while banks face large external debt repayments during the remainder of the
year which will continue to put pressure on their liquidity. In the face of these challenges, a
clear picture of the vulnerabilities facing the banks needs to be developed, and steps taken to
mitigate risks. Delaying adjustment, for example by replacing maturing external borrowing
with new higher-cost, short-maturity funding, is likely to increase vulnerabilities in the
future. Banks should have in place plans to maintain liquidity, preserve asset quality, and
continue to meet solvency standards, including, if necessary, by raising additional capital.
For their part, the supervisors need to ensure that banks are realistically assessing their
business models, adequately provisioning to cover rising NPLs, taking a conservative
approach to collateral valuations in an environment of limited liquidity and falling prices in
the property market, and carefully monitoring risks from off-balance sheet transactions.
22.
Bank supervision and regulation need to be strengthened. The recent efforts by
the FSA to step up their supervision of banks and conduct more rigorous stress tests of the
system are welcome. The government’s commitment to increase the resources available to
the FSA will help these endeavors. Efforts are particularly needed to develop offsite
supervisory capacities, with a reduced emphasis on form filling, a greater role for analysis,
and prompt follow-up, including through additional inspections when issues of concern arise.
Regulatory measures to encourage banks to focus on raising domestic resources are
welcome, although in some other areas it is important that overregulation does not distort the
market forces of intermediation or stymie the risk-taking nature of the banking business.
23.
The authorities have made considerable progress in developing their financial
safety net framework. The principles of the Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) on
Financial Stability, are sound and help establish a foundation for managing any difficulties
that may emerge in the banking system. The liquidity support framework has proved
effective at providing support to banks during the recent turbulence, although it is important
that the central bank’s balance sheet is not compromised by these operations. Reforms to
give the authorities more flexibility to react to adverse changes in a bank’s financial position
would also be helpful.
24.
Staff support the NBK’s policy of maintaining a stable exchange rate during this
current period of uncertainty. While staff have previously advocated greater exchange rate
flexibility to help contain overheating pressures, the current position is justified by the
different circumstances now facing the country. If downward pressures on the exchange rate
were to resume, a number of steps could be taken to support the tenge, including: continuing
to delay conversion of the oil fund receipts into dollars; encouraging commercial banks to
use their own foreign currency assets to meet external debt repayment obligations; and
intervening in the foreign exchange market, although under a clear operational rule that limits
the amount of reserves committed to defend the exchange rate. When conditions in financial
markets improve, a return to a more flexible exchange rate policy would be desirable.

16
25.
The exchange rate regime in Kazakhstan has been reclassified from a managed
float to a conventional peg under the IMF’s de facto classification system. This is due to
the very limited movement of the tenge against the U.S. dollar since last October. At present,
the staff’s assessment is that there is no clear evidence of either over or undervaluation of
Kazakhstan’s real exchange rate when compared to its estimated equilibrium level (Box 4).
26.
The NBK’s current monetary policy stance is appropriate for now given that
growth is expected to remain quite subdued, inflation pressures are beginning to ease,
and there are few signs that recent high inflation is feeding into wages. If, however,
inflation does not ease as expected, wage pressures accelerate, or the exchange rate comes
under significant downward pressure, a monetary tightening would need to be considered.
27.
The fiscal position in Kazakhstan is very strong, with a large budget surplus and
low public debt. The nonoil fiscal deficit this year is expected to remain below the level staff
estimate to be consistent with maintaining per capita oil wealth constant in real terms
(Figure 5). The government therefore has room to allow the automatic fiscal stabilizers to
operate, rather than seeking to offset any shortfalls in tax revenue that may occur as a result
of the slowing economy. Indeed, measures to increase tax rates or lower expenditures to meet
previously set fiscal targets could aggravate the slowdown or lead to an inefficient allocation
of resources where export taxes keep domestic prices artificially low. The staff welcomes the
recently announced budget measures, and sees scope for a fiscal stimulus package in the
event of a sharper-than-expected slowing in growth, although it is important that it be welltargeted and consistent with development and fiscal reform objectives.
28.
The recent sharp rise in food prices is a concern. A well-crafted response is needed
to mitigate the negative effect on poorer sections of the population, while encouraging
increased production of food products in the future. Given the strong fiscal position, there is
scope to introduce well-targeted government subsidies to low income households to help
offset the higher cost of food. This would be a better response than measures that seek to
influence prices, including trade restrictions, as these reduce incentives for higher production.
Efforts to boost agricultural production and improve distribution systems will also help
alleviate price pressures going forward.
29.
The publication of Kazakhstan’s first report under the Extractive Industries
Transparency Initiative (EITI) initiative is welcome. This represents an important step in
further increasing the transparency of revenues received by the government from companies
in the oil sector. The staff encourages the prompt passage of the draft bill to help bring
Kazakhstan’s AML/CFT legislation in line with international best practice.
30.
It is proposed that the next Article IV consultation take place on the standard
12-month cycle.

Box 4. Assessing the Real Exchange Rate (RER) in Kazakhstan
With the tenge effectively tied to the depreciating U.S.
dollar since last August, the nominal effective exchange
rate has weakened over the past year. The real effective
exchange rate, however, has appreciated by 11 percent as
the inflation differential between Kazakhstan and its main
trading partners has widened.

Against this background, three approaches were

100
applied to assess the RER against its estimated
“equilibrium” medium-term level. The equilibrium real
90
exchange rate (ERER) approach estimates an
“equilibrium” level based on fundamental economic
determinants. The macroeconomic balance (MB) approach Source: IMF staff calculations.
estimates the “equilibrium” current account (“norm”) and
assesses the gap between this “norm” and the projected medium-term (“underlying”) current account balance.
Finally, the purchasing power parity (PPP) approach estimates the deviation of the RER from its “long-run
level” based on an international comparison of price and productivity levels (deviations are on trade-weighted
basis).
The ERER and PPP approaches suggest undervaluation, while the MB approach suggests overvaluation.
The MB approach, however, has weaknesses for an oil exporter such as Kazakhstan. In the MB methodology,
oil prices have a strong positive impact on the estimated current account “norm,” but oil-related capital
equipment imports and income flows to foreign owners—which are significant in Kazakhstan—are not captured
in the model, hence overestimating the norm and the degree of overvaluation. The ERER approach also
warrants some caution as the assumption of no misalignment over the sample period (1995–2007) is not likely
to have held for Kazakhstan given the significant structural changes that were occurring in the economy during
this time. A fourth methodology, the external sustainability approach, was not applied because of the
difficulties of accounting for oil wealth in the ground in the case of an oil exporting country such as
Kazakhstan.
On the basis of the analysis, staff assess that there is no clear evidence of either over or undervaluation of
the real exchange rate compared to its estimated equilibrium level. There is, however, considerable
uncertainty surrounding the assessment given methodological shortcomings and the variation in results.

1/ Shaded areas represent actual data including 2007. Individual shocks are permanent one-half standard
deviation shocks. Figures in the boxes represent average projections for the respective variables in the
baseline and scenario being presented. Ten-year historical average for the variable is also shown.
2/ Oil price shock is a permanent drop in oil price to $50/barrel in 2008. Nominal GDP in this scenario is kept
at the baseline for comparison purposes.
3/ Permanent 1/4 standard deviation shocks applied to real interest rate, growth rate, and current account
balance.
4/ One-time real depreciation of 30 percent occurs in 2008, which corresponds to a 61 percent nominal
depreciation.

1/ Derived as [r - g - r(1+g) + ea(1+r)]/(1+g+r+gr) times previous period debt stock, with r = nominal effective interest rate on external debt; r = change in domestic GDP deflator in US dollar terms, g = real GDP growth rate,
e = nominal appreciation (increase in dollar value of domestic currency), and a = share of domestic-currency denominated debt in total external debt.
2/ The contribution from price and exchange rate changes is defined as [-r(1+g) + ea(1+r)]/(1+g+r+gr) times previous period debt stock. r increases with an appreciating domestic currency (e > 0) and rising inflation (based on GDP deflator).
3/ For projection, line includes the impact of price and exchange rate changes.
4/ Defined as current account deficit, plus amortization on medium- and long-term debt, plus short-term debt at end of previous period.
5/ The key variables include real GDP growth; nominal interest rate; dollar deflator growth; and both non-interest current account and non-debt inflows in percent of GDP.
6/ Long-run, constant balance that stabilizes the debt ratio assuming that key variables (real GDP growth, nominal interest rate, dollar deflator growth, and non-debt inflows in percent of GDP) remain at their levels
of the last projection year.

B1. Nominal interest rate is at baseline plus one-half standard deviation
B2. Real GDP growth is at baseline minus one-half standard deviations
B3. Non-interest current account is at baseline minus one-half standard deviations
B4. Combination of B1-B3 using 1/4 standard deviation shocks
B5. One time 30 percent real depreciation in 2008

B. Bound Tests

A1. Key variables are at their historical averages in 2008-13 4/

VIII. Exchange Rate Arrangements
The currency of Kazakhstan is the tenge, which was introduced in November 1993. The
official exchange rate is determined on the basis of foreign exchange auctions that are held
daily. Auctions are held for U.S. dollars, euros, and Russian rubles, and official rates are
quoted for over 30 other currencies on the basis of cross-rates. Since late 1999, the exchange
rate regime has been a managed float with no preannounced path, although since
October 2007 the exchange rate has effectively been pegged to the U.S. dollar. As a result,
the classification of the tenge exchange rate has been changed to a conventional peg.
On June 12, 2008, the tenge/U.S. dollar rate was 120.8. The exchange rates at numerous
exchange bureaus are very close to the auction rate, and the spread between buying and
selling rates is very small. The exchange system is free from restrictions on payments and
transfers for current international transactions.
IX.

Article IV Consultation

Kazakhstan is on the standard 12-month consultation cycle. The last consultation was
concluded on July 10, 2007 (see IMF Country Report No. 07/235).

FSAP Participation and ROSCS

Kazakhstan participated in the Financial Sector Assessment Program (FSAP) in 2000.
The staff report on the Financial Sector Stability Assessment (FSSA) was issued on
November 27, 2000 (FO/DIS/00/142). The FSSA included the following ROSC
modules: Basel Core Principles for Effective Banking Supervision, Core Principles for
Systemically Important Payment Systems, Code of Good Practices on Transparency in
Monetary and Financial Policies, IOSCO Objectives and Principles of Securities
Regulation, and IAIS Insurance Core Principles. An FSAP Update mission took place in
February 2004 and a second FSAP Update mission took place in March 2008. The fiscal
transparency module was completed in October 2002 and the final report published in
April 2003. A data module mission took place in April/May 2002, and its final report was
published in March 2003. An update of the data ROSC was undertaken in 2006 and the
report was published in February 2008 (see Annex V).
XI.

Technical Assistance

Kazakhstan has received technical assistance and training by the Fund in virtually every area
of economic policy, including through about 75 technical assistance missions provided
during 1993–2007 by FAD, LEG, MCM, STA, and the IMF Institute. In addition to short-

4
term missions, the Fund has provided resident advisors to the National Bank of Kazakhstan,

Annex II. Kazakhstan: Relations with the World Bank Group
(As of January 31, 2008)
Kazakhstan became a member of the International Bank for Reconstruction and
Development (IBRD) and International Development Association (IDA) in July 1992
and of the International Finance Corporation (IFC) in September 1993. The Bank’s
lending program has been curtailed in recent years as a result of the country’s reduced
borrowing needs, but this year was revived with four new approved projects which will start
implementation in FY09. In addition to new lending activities, there is an expanded program
of economic research which allows the Bank to respond to the government’s critical
development needs. In FY08 the total financing of the Joint Economic Research Program
(JERP) amounts to just under $3 million, of which about 66 percent is directly financed by
the government. The research under this extended umbrella is build around four main
activities aligned with the government’s development priorities: (i) public finance
management review; (ii) administrative reform; (iii) modernization of communal services;
and (iv) private sector development initiatives.
At present, the Bank’s program comprises thirteen projects (twelve IBRD loans and
one Global Environmental Facility (GEF) grant) with a total commitment of
$713 million, of which $313 million has been disbursed. In the Bank’s portfolio, there are
eight active loans (Road Transport Restructuring, Electricity Transmission Rehabilitation,
Syr Darya Control and Northern Aral Sea - Phase I, Nura River Clean-Up, Agricultural PostPrivatization Assistance - Phase II, Agricultural Competitiveness, North–South Electricity
Transmission, and Forest Protection and Reforestation) with a commitment of $534 million,
one old GEF grant (Drylands Management) of $5 million, and four recently approved new
loans (Ust–Kamenogorsk Environment Remediation, Customs Development, Health Sector
Technology Transfer and Institutional Reform, and Technology Commercialization) with a
commitment of $174 million. The Bank is also preparing five new projects (Irrigation and
Drainage Improvement - Phase II, South–West Transport Corridor Road Rehabilitation,
Vocational Education and Training, Territorial Development, and Syr Darya Control and
Northern Aral Sea - Phase II) with an expected financing envelope of about $654 million.
Kazakhstan is the IFC's largest client in Central Asia. As of end-February 2008, IFC’s
total portfolio in Kazakhstan was $124 million, which is mostly in general manufacturing and
financial sector investments. IFC will continue to expand its work by fostering dynamic
private sector led growth in Kazakhstan, particularly in the nonextractive sectors and in the
frontier regions of the country. This includes ongoing support to the financial sector, and
when possible, investments to promote SME development, as well as investments in
manufacturing, construction and construction materials, infrastructure, and the service sector.
IFC will focus on: (a) further stabilization, diversification, and extension of the maturity of
the funding base in the banking sector; and (b) establishment of the best international
banking and corporate governance and regulatory environment.

7
Annex III. Kazakhstan: Relations with the EBRD
(As of December 31, 2007)
The EBRD is the largest investor outside the oil and gas sector in Kazakhstan.
As of December 2007, the bank’s total business volume in Kazakhstan stood at €3.4 billion
with EBRD investments totalling €1.7 billion. The bank’s gross cumulative disbursements
reached €1.4 billion. During 2007, the bank signed 20 projects for total EBRD finance of
€532 million. The sector allocation of business volume has shifted towards the corporate
sector and more than 80 percent of all EBRD investments are now in the private sector. The
portfolio private/public ratio is not expected to change much during the coming year. The
bank aims to increase the share of equity in its annual business volume in Kazakhstan (which
reached 21 percent of projects signed in 2007). EBRD involvement in the country remains
guided by the Bank’s most recent country strategy for Kazakhstan, approved in
November 2006.
The Bank’s main operational objectives for 2007–2008 are the following:
Enterprise sector: Support economic diversification and enhance competition by working
directly with corporates across various sectors such as general industry, power, agribusiness,
telecoms and property. Promote projects leading to higher energy efficiency and increase the
capitalization of enterprises through equity investments. Increase competition in the natural
resources sector by working with smaller operators and on higher risk projects. Dedicate
resources in order to directly finance smaller projects and continue to provide micro and
small financing and tailored capacity building using the Kazakhstan Small Business
Programme (KSBP) and leasing facility. Promote high standards of corporate governance,
integrity and transparency of ownership, including through FDI. Selectively support regional
cross-border expansion of reputable Kazakh companies to neighbouring markets.
Infrastructure sector: Increase EBRD’s support in transport, energy, and telecommunication
infrastructure development to satisfy the growing needs of the economy and promote
reforms. The bank will focus on non-sovereign projects. On a selective basis, it will take
leadership in developing and actively engaging in appropriately structured public-private
partnerships (PPPs) that involve competitive tender processes. Work with state holding
company Samruk on finding synergies between different parts of infrastructure and
improving corporate governance in respective of state owned enterprises. Support further
regulatory and tariff development that promotes investments and fair access to infrastructure.
Financial sector: To promote strategic FDI into the financial sector, but also to open up the
capital base of local banks to reputable financial investors through initial public offerings
(IPOs) or private placements. To continue to work actively with existing shareholders of
Kazakh banks to achieve better transparency of ownership and corporate governance.
Facilitate competition in the financial sector by providing debt and equity, particularly to
medium-sized banks and nonbank microfinance institutions (NBMFIs), thus supporting
micro, small-, and medium-sized enterprises (MSMEs). A special emphasis will be on the
provision of financial resources outside the main cities and in rural areas. The Bank will
support the development of leasing, insurance and pensions, the further deepening of

8
mortgage markets (especially outside of the two main cities) and facilitate the securitization
of assets by Kazakh financial institutions.
Policy dialogue: Support the Government in its efforts to improve the investment climate
and to diversify the economic structure, leading to improved global competitiveness.
Cooperate with the state-holding companies Samruk and Kazyna to achieve corporate
governance and operational improvements of state-owned enterprises. Promote transparent
practices and fight corruption to improve the business environment. Promote adoption of the
anti-money laundering (AML) legislation, especially in light of the government initiative to
create the Regional Financial Centre in Almaty (RFCA).
Main trends in the portfolio over the past year
The most notable progress was made in the General Industry sector. Two new industry
projects started––an investment in Kazakhstan Kagazy project (EBRD finance €20 million),
and a loan to Karcement Kazakhstan (EBRD finance €15.5 million). A loan was also signed
in brewery production to EFES Kazakhstan (EBRD finance €30 million). One of the
milestone projects signed in 2007 in Kazakhstan is the Mittal Steel Temirtau Health & Safety
Loan (EBRD finance of €70.5 million) designed to support improvements to the health and
safety practices at coal mines. The project is the first in a wider EBRD initiative to support
improvements to environmental, health and safety practices in mines in the Bank’s countries
of operations. Another important project is the equity subscription for €40 million EBRD
share in Kazakhstan–Meinl Caucasus and Central Asia, a retail real estate investment
fund/joint-venture.
The Bank strengthened its efforts to improve transparency of ownership and integrity
in Kazakhstan's banking sector. The Bank made a €15 million equity investment for a
20 percent stake in Kazinvestbank. Equity market development was also supported through
investments in two funds, Centras Private Equity (€8 million) and Barings Vostok Fund
(€6 million). The Bank promoted further development of the market for residential
mortgages by providing a mortgage finance facility to Bank Centre Credit for €3 million.
EBRD also signed a €219 million syndicated A/B loan to Kazkommertsbank, one-third of
which for its own account. The Trade Facilitation Program (TFP) remained an important
instrument in supporting a wide range of trade transactions of Kazakh enterprises, including
long-term intraregional imports. In 2007, the EBRD committed loans and guarantees under
the Regional Trade facilitation program in excess of €93 million.
Priorities for the coming year
Power shortages are becoming an important constraint on private sector development,
especially in Southern Kazakhstan. To support the Government with regulatory
improvements and tariff reform should be the key focus of the Bank’s operations in this area,
leading to investments in power generation, transmission and distribution.
The transport and communication infrastructure will be key to the country’s long term
competitiveness and regional cooperation and integration. Rehabilitation of the road network,

9
including the South–West transport corridor, will play an important role, as will the
necessary improvements of airport infrastructure.
The Bank will aim to capitalize from its improved presence in the corporate sector, making
long-term funding and equity finance available to corporates, especially now that commercial
bank funding has slowed down significantly. The focus here should be on value-added
processing, for instance in agribusiness, and manufacturing industries. This should include
projects with energy efficiency and safety components.
In the financial sector, the Bank’s assistance is needed in light of the global credit crunch,
the resulting large repayment obligations of Kazakh banks, and the related slowdown of bank
lending in Kazakhstan. The Bank will continue to provide long-term debt, to support the
equity of banks, to facilitate the entry of strategic investors, and will aim to reconnect
Kazakh banks to the international financial markets through arranging syndicated loans (A/B
structure). For 2008, the focus will be on SME and micro lending, as well as the introduction
of energy efficiency credit lines. In addition, the Bank will have an important role to play in
working with private equity funds and nonbank financial institutions to promote the
development of the local capital market as a complement to bank lending. Transparency of
shareholding structures and the willingness to improve corporate governance will be a
precondition to any future Bank financing in Kazakhstan.

Annex IV. Kazakhstan: Relations with the Asian Development Bank
(As of March 5, 2008)
Kazakhstan became a member of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) in 1994. As of
March 2008, total public sector loan commitments amounted to $483 million, covering
14 loans in agriculture and natural resources, education, finance, transport and
communications, and water supply, sanitation and waste management. Kazakhstan is no
longer eligible for concessional resources from the Asian Development Fund. As of
January 2008, total loan disbursements amounted to $435 million. ADB's focal areas
continue to be private sector development, environmentally sustainable development, and
regional cooperation.
Private sector operations are at the forefront of current and future ADB operations in
the country. A Private Sector Operations Agreement between the Republic of Kazakhstan
and the ADB was signed in November 2004. It provided a basis for ADB's business
opportunities in the Kazakhstani private sector. During 2006–2007, seven private sector
financings in the amount of $550 million were approved by the ADB for Kazakhstan to boost
financial sector and SME development in the country.
ADB’s debut local currency bonds (in Tenge) in Kazakhstan were issued in
August 2007. The issue had a principal amount of 6 billion Tenge (equivalent to
$49 million). Proceeds of the Tenge bond issue were used to finance ADB’s private sector
banking activities in the country (ADB’s first local currency loan to JSC Bank Center Credit
to support small- and medium-sized business was approved on August 7).
ADB operations for the private sector focus primarily on two sectors: (i) finance and
capital markets, and (ii) infrastructure. In the financial and capital markets sector, ADB
assists private sector intermediaries in banking, leasing, micro credit, small- and mediumenterprises (SME), private equity funds, insurance, and securitization. In the infrastructure
sector, ADB’s focus is on telecommunications, power and energy, water supply and
sanitation, ports, airports, toll roads, and support for subsovereign credit.
This new thrust towards private sector operations will be supported by public sector
technical assistance, investments to create an enabling environment for the private
sector, and selected public lending programs. The latter will be in rural water supply and
water resources management to improve livelihood in rural areas and reducing urban-rural
gap. After the successful completion of water resources management and land improvement
project in South Kazakhstan Oblast in December 2006, the Government requested the ADB
to assist with a second phase project to complete irrigation on the remaining 87,000 ha in the
project area. ADB approved a Project Preparatory TA in December 2007.

11
Annex V. Kazakhstan: Statistical Issues
The quality of the economic statistics is generally adequate for surveillance. Kazakhstan
has made considerable progress since the 2002 data ROSC, as reflected in the update
published on February 2008. On March 2003, Kazakhstan became a subscriber to the Special
Data Dissemination Standard (SDDS), marking a major step forward in the development of
the country’s statistical system.
Sector specific issues
Building on the progress achieved since 2002, IMF missions in February and August,
2006 assisted in developing a more analytically useful disaggregation of the national
accounts and balance of payments into oil and nonoil sector components. This should
permit a better assessment of macroeconomic developments and policy formulation. STA
also provided recommendations for improving the quarterly national accounts (QNA) data.
However, several weaknesses remain in both the quality of GDP estimates by sector
produced by the National Statistical Agency (NSA), and the quality and timeliness of
GDP estimates by expenditure. First, the quality of GDP estimates by industry is affected
by the limited coverage of small businesses in selected activities such as retail and
construction. Second, while some progress has been made in making GDP estimates by
final expenditure consistent with output-based measures, compilation and dissemination of
quarterly GDP series data should be conducted on a discrete basis only. The 2006 Multitopic
Statistics Mission on Oil Activities made recommendations in a number of other areas,
including: deflators, data sources for intermediate consumption and inventories, adjustments
for holding gains for intermediate consumption, methods for deriving constant price
estimates of changes in inventories, taxes and subsidies, and retail trade, and methods for
recording work in progress.
Overall, the NSA utilizes sound statistical techniques to ensure the accuracy and
reliability of the consumer price index (CPI). However, use of the geometric mean as
elementary aggregate is recommended instead of the relative of average prices, as is the case
for the producer price index. Also, there is scope for improving the imputation method used
for some seasonal items in long time series for the CPI.
Progress has also been made in the classification of the fiscal accounts consistent with
the Fund’s Government Finance Statistics Manual 2001 (GFSM 2001). However, as a
result of the reorganization of the public sector, including the redefinition of budgetary units,
difficulties have arisen with regard to the recording and reporting of expenditure arrears.
Since 1997, the authorities have reported detailed data for publication in the GFS Yearbook.
The latest data reported for publication cover consolidated general government and are
presented using a format consistent with the GFSM 2001. There is no program for transition
to the accrual methodology of GFSM 2001. The Ministry of Finance also provides monthly
indicators covering the general government for publication in International Financial
Statistics (IFS).

12
The existing framework for compiling monetary statistics generally conforms to the
methodology in the IMF’s Monetary and Financial Statistics Manual (MFSM), and data
are compiled on a timely basis. Steps are being taken by the National Bank of Kazakhstan
(NBK) to further improve the quality of data. In particular, the chart of accounts for
commercial banks has been revised to enable the NBK to distinguish sectors and financial
instruments in accordance with the MFSM. The NBK compiles monetary statistics based on
the Standardized Report Forms (SRFs), which are published in the IFS Supplement. The
NBK has extended institutional coverage to compile a financial sector survey that includes
the Development Bank. The authorities have started implementing the recommendations of
the previous STA missions regarding the use of residency criteria as defined in the Balance
of Payments Manual, fifth edition (BPM5), including classifying foreign branches and
foreign companies’ representatives as “resident.” The NBK is now addressing the issues
raised by MCD and STA regarding the inconsistencies in the positions between the NBK
(reported in SRF 1SR) and the other depository corporations (reported in SRF 2SR).
There are also shortcomings in external debt statistics. Public and publicly-guaranteed
debt excludes external debt of public enterprises and development institutions, which is
instead included in private debt.
In the balance of payments, the overall quality of data is satisfactory. Considerable
progress has been made in implementing Fund technical assistance recommendations. In
particular, the coverage of trade data has been improved through a survey to determine the
volume of shuttle trade and travel expenses. The NBK has also worked closely with relevant
agencies, including STA staff, to update the ratios used for adjusting c.i.f. imports to an f.o.b.
basis, which resulted in a revision of import data from 2000 to 2004. Compilation of export
and import price indices has been initiated, and historical data are also now available. In
general, the balance of payments is compiled in concordance with the fifth edition of the
Balance of Payments Statistics Manual (BPM5). However, foreign direct investment
statistics are not fully in line with the standards set forth in BPM5, as local branch offices of
foreign companies operating in the construction sector are considered nonresident entities.
This leads to discrepancies with national accounts statistics where this activity is treated as
domestic production.

Statement by the IMF Staff Representative
July 9, 2008
1.
The following information has become available since the staff report was issued.
These developments do not change the thrust of the staff appraisal.
2.

Recent data releases show that:

•

The CPI increased by 1.2 percent (m/m) in June, and by 5.7 percent in the first half of
2008. The year-on-year inflation rate rose to 20 percent in June, from 19.5 percent in
May. Food price inflation was a little over 29 percent (y/y) in June, while non-food
prices rose by 13.6 percent (y/y).

•

The current account swung from a deficit of $2 billion in the fourth quarter of 2007 to
a surplus of $3.9 billion in the first quarter of 2008 due to a sharp slowdown in
imports and higher oil prices. The financial account remained weak in the first quarter
as bank access to external financing declined.

Official foreign currency assets have continued to rise. At end-June, foreign exchange
reserves stood at $21.2 billion and NFRK foreign currency assets at $25.7 billion.

3.
The National Bank of Kazakhstan (NBK) lowered its refinancing rate from 11 percent
to 10.5 percent on July 1. It also announced that minimum reserve requirements would be cut
from 6 percent to 5 percent on domestic liabilities and from 8 percent to 7 percent on other
liabilities as of July 29. The cut in reserve requirements is expected to free up about
T 90 billion ($750 million) in liquidity for the banking system. The NBK cited its desire to
support credit expansion and growth and its expectation that inflation will ease in the second
half of the year as the reasons for its actions.
4.
In the financial sector, non-performing loans on bank balance sheets have continued
to rise, reaching 16.4 percent of total loans (“broad” definition) at end-May, up from
15.3 percent at end-March (on the “narrow” definition also shown in the staff report, NPLs
increased to 4.4 percent at end-May, from 3.7 percent at end-March). An investment fund
based in the United Arab Emirates has recently announced its intention to increase its stake
in Kazkommertsbank, Kazakhstan’s second largest bank, from 8 percent to 25 percent (the
transaction still requires regulatory approval). Lastly, the Kazakhstan Deposit Insurance Fund
(KDIF) has received a capital injection from the NBK of T 14 billion, almost doubling its
capital to T 30 billion ($250 million).

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2008 Article IV Consultation with the
Republic of Kazakhstan
On July 9, 2008, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded the
Article IV consultation with the Republic of Kazakhstan. 1
Background
From 2000–2007, the Kazakhstan economy enjoyed an extended period of very rapid growth,
with real GDP growth averaging 10 percent annually. The expansion was underpinned by the
development of the oil sector, prudent macroeconomic policies, structural reforms, and
increased access to global financial markets. As a result, real per capita incomes have doubled
since 2000 and social indicators have improved.
More recently, the global financial turmoil that began last summer had a significant impact on
the Kazakhstan economy. Market perceptions of risk on Kazakhstan’s assets rose sharply last
September and remain relatively elevated. As commercial bank access to external funding was
reduced, domestic liquidity conditions tightened considerably, and banks sharply curtailed
lending. Real GDP growth has slowed and, after several years of rapid gains, property prices
are declining.

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On
return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the
Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the
Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the
country's authorities.

2
Bank profitability has nonetheless remained robust and aggregate capital adequacy is above
the regulatory minimum. However, financial soundness indicators are showing some signs of
deterioration and the banking system is exposed to risks related to the property market and
lending in foreign currency to the corporate sector. The authorities are working to reduce the
vulnerabilities facing the banks by intensifying supervision, strengthening the regulatory
framework, and establishing a comprehensive financial safety net framework.
The authorities reacted appropriately to the sudden stop in capital inflows. The central bank
(NBK) provided extra liquidity support to banks and intervened in the foreign exchange market
to ensure exchange rate stability. Foreign reserves have since recovered, oil fund (NFRK)
assets have continued to grow, and the government has allocated additional fiscal spending to
support ongoing construction and investment projects. Fiscal policy has nevertheless remained
prudent: the overall fiscal surplus was 5.2 percent of GDP in 2007 and is expected to rise
further in 2008 on the back of strong oil revenues.
Economic growth is expected to remain relatively subdued. Real GDP is forecast to grow by
5 percent and 6¼ percent in 2008 and 2009 respectively. The current account is projected to
move into surplus in 2008 following the large deficit last year, due to higher oil and commodity
prices and much slower import growth. Consumer price inflation (CPI) has begun to ease and
is expected to decline to single digit rates by year-end. While risks to the outlook are on the
downside, the country has large financial resources to help weather the current situation.
Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors observed that the economic situation has been affected significantly by the
recent global financial turmoil, with growth slowing down and liquidity conditions tightening. The
authorities’ prompt policy responses have been instrumental in helping the country weather the
current difficulties. Directors noted that, while risks to the outlook remain on the downside,
growth prospects in the medium term are still favorable, and the Republic of Kazakhstan has
considerable financial resources at it disposal, including comfortable levels of the oil fund and
international reserves. Directors stressed that policies should continue to focus on managing
risks and promoting a return to strong, sustainable growth, supported by a sound banking
system and ongoing reforms aimed at diversifying the economy and boosting competition.
Directors welcomed the considerable progress made in developing a financial safety net
framework, which has proven effective in supporting the banking sector in response to the dryup of external financing over the past year. They looked forward to the operationalization of a
Memorandum of Understanding on Financial Stability, which sets out the framework for
cooperation among relevant bodies during periods of financial distress. In this context, they
underscored the importance of enhancing the authorities’ flexibility to react to adverse

3
developments in banks without compromising the central bank’s financial position or creating
moral hazard.
Directors noted with concern the deteriorating loan quality at the banks, linked to their high
exposures to the weakening property market and rapid credit growth in recent years. Further
efforts will be needed to strengthen banking supervision and regulations, and to fully implement
the Financial Sector Assessment Program (FSAP) Update recommendations. Immediate
priorities are to improve both onsite and offsite supervision, and to strengthen capacity for
stress testing and risk analysis. Steps should also be taken to ensure that banks have
sufficient capital and provisioning, and to strengthen the operational autonomy of the Financial
Supervision Agency.
Directors agreed that, in current circumstances, preserving a stable exchange rate is key to
boosting depositor confidence, limiting the risks from the large foreign currency exposure of the
corporate sector, and helping reduce inflation. Any intervention in the foreign exchange market
to ease downward pressures on the exchange rate should be carried out under clear
operational rules that limit reserve losses. Directors encouraged the authorities to return to a
more flexible exchange rate policy when financial market conditions improve. They noted the
staff’s assessment that there is currently no clear evidence of undervaluation or overvaluation
of the real exchange rate relative to its equilibrium.
Directors emphasized the importance of pursuing monetary policy that strikes an appropriate
balance between preserving financial stability, cushioning downside risks to growth, and
ensuring a downward path of inflation. They encouraged the authorities to monitor headline
inflation closely, given the possibility of further food and oil price increases, and to stand ready
to tighten monetary policy as needed to bring down inflation to the targeted level.
Directors commended the authorities for their prudent fiscal management, which has resulted
in large budget surpluses and low public debt, and created ample room for automatic
stabilizers to operate. With the economy weakening, Directors supported the recently
announced measures to increase spending in priority areas. They saw room for a further welltargeted fiscal stimulus should growth slow more sharply than expected, while being mindful of
its inflationary impact. At the same time, efforts should continue to improve public financial
management, with the assistance of the World Bank. Directors looked forward to the
finalization of a new tax code, which should help ease the tax burden on the nonoil sector.
Directors emphasized the need for a well-crafted response to the sharp rise in food prices,
including well-targeted transfer programs for low-income households. Efforts should be
strengthened to improve agricultural production and distribution systems, while avoiding trade
restrictions that affect prices in international markets.

4
Directors welcomed the publication of the Republic of Kazakhstan’s first report under the
Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative. They encouraged the prompt passage of the draft
bill to help bring the Republic of Kazakhstan’s AML/CFT legislation in line with international
best practice.

Public Information Notices (PINs) form part of the IMF's efforts to promote transparency of the IMF's
views and analysis of economic developments and policies. With the consent of the country
(or countries) concerned, PINs are issued after Executive Board discussions of Article IV consultations
with member countries, of its surveillance of developments at the regional level, of post-program
monitoring, and of ex post assessments of member countries with longer-term program engagements.
PINs are also issued after Executive Board discussions of general policy matters, unless otherwise
decided by the Executive Board in a particular case. The staff report (use the free Adobe Acrobat
