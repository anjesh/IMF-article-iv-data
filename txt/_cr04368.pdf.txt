EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
Over 2001-03 macroeconomic performance was broadly satisfactory. Real GDP grew
strongly, on average by 5.3 percent a year; inflation was low; and the fiscal stance remained
appropriate. Banking system financial indicators remained solid. However, structural reforms
incurred significant delays, especially regarding the divestiture program, and external
competitiveness deteriorated.
Economic activity this year has been adversely affected by a poor cotton crop and the
tightening of import restrictions by Nigeria. As a result, real GDP growth is now projected
at 3 percent in 2004, the external current account deficit is expected to widen by ½
percentage points of GDP, and tax revenue would be lower than previously anticipated.
Discussions focused on remedial actions to address the causes and consequences of the
weakness in economic activity this year, and the policies needed to achieve the authorities’
medium-term objectives. There was broad agreement on the following policy agenda:
•

To address the recent problems, the authorities decided to take strong actions in
the fiscal area to compensate for the shortfall in revenue, and in the cotton sector to
prevent the recurrence of disturbances during the 2004/05 crop season; also, they are
pursuing discussions with the Nigerian authorities on trade issues.

•

In view of the weak performance since the beginning of 2004 and the risk of
sustained import restrictions by Nigeria, the authorities have revised downward
their path for economic growth. Their objective is now to raise real GDP growth
gradually to the 7 percent target set in the PRSP.

•

Over the medium term, fiscal policy will seek to support the authorities’ poverty
reduction strategy, while keeping the overall deficit in line with the objective of
debt sustainability. Revenue mobilization will be strengthened through the
enhancement of tax and customs administration. On the expenditure side, efforts will
be made to better reflect PRSP priorities in budgetary allocations, while keeping total
outlays stable in terms of GDP.

•

The authorities will seek to speed up the implementation of the structural reform
agenda so as to reach their medium-term objectives. This agenda focuses on
strengthening the cotton sector reform, advancing the implementation of the
divestiture program, and introducing a new civil service reform. In parallel, private
sector activities will be promoted by forcefully fighting corruption and strengthening
the legal and judiciary system.

The authorities as well as the representatives of the private sector and the donor
community in Benin concurred with the thrust of the ex post assessment (EPA). They
stressed that a further PRGF arrangement would help Benin in addressing the challenges in
the Fund's core areas of responsibility and facilitate the mobilization of donors' assistance.

I. INTRODUCTION
1.
The last Article IV consultation was concluded on July 15, 2002. On that occasion,
Directors noted the sound macroeconomic performance achieved, but they observed that
progress on the structural front had been uneven, and emphasized the importance of
accelerating the pace of structural reforms in order to increase the potential growth of the
economy and reduce poverty.1
2.
The three-year arrangement under the Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility
(PRGF) approved in July 2000 for an amount of SDR 27 million ended in March 2004 with
the full amount drawn. Benin’s outstanding use of Fund resources amounted to SDR 46.9
million (75.8 percent of quota) at end-May 2004. Benin finalized its PRSP in early 2003
and reached the completion point under the enhanced HIPC Initiative in March 2003.
3.
On the political front, President Kérékou was elected for a second term in
March 2001, and the parties supporting him obtained a large majority in the legislative
elections in March 2003. The next presidential elections are scheduled to take place in 2006.
II. RECENT ECONOMIC PERFORMANCE
4.
Economic performance was broadly satisfactory over the last three years (2001–
03), although Benin’s external competitiveness deteriorated during the period. Real GDP
grew steadily and inflation was

is pegged; at end-2003, Benin had preserved about 25 percent of the external competitive
gains from the devaluation of the CFA franc in 1994 (Figure 3).2
5.
Despite these achievements, the economy has remained vulnerable to external
shocks, and there has not been significant progress in poverty reduction, according to
the PRSP presented in 2003.3 Its progress toward achieving the Millennium Development
Goals (MDGs) has been generally slow, especially in the areas of women's education,
sanitation, and child and maternal health (Table 14); and the rural population has not
benefited from the overall slight decrease in the incidence of income poverty (MDG goal 1).
Furthermore, Benin's economy has remained highly dependent on cotton production and
exports to Nigeria, which together account for more than two-thirds of exports of goods and
nonfactor services.
6.
While the budget deficit was contained in recent years, the composition of
spending remained a problem. Benin complied with five of the six primary convergence
criteria of the West African Economic and Monetary Union (WAEMU) and made progress
towards meeting the secondary criteria (Table 7). Revenue collection strengthened, mostly
reflecting improvements in tax administration; but weaknesses in customs
administration—particularly regarding customs valuation and the fight against fraud—have
remained a major concern. Total outlays were broadly on track; however, spending for
health and education as well as

Half of the competitive gains were lost by end-1995, owing to the initial surge in prices in
1994–95 that followed the parity change. The real effective exchange rate remained roughly
stable during 1996–2000, as inflation was brought under control.
3

The reasons for this limited progress in reducing poverty are unclear, as methodological
weaknesses in the PRSP have precluded a full analysis of this issue, as indicated in the Joint
Staff Assessment (JSA) of February 24, 2003. However, the authorities have begun to work
on improving the analysis of the determinants of poverty.

-7-

mechanism for tracking poverty-reducing expenditure. However, some important weaknesses
remained in the areas of internal controls, treasury accounting, and public procurement, as
was reported by the Fund technical assistance mission that visited Cotonou at end-August
2003. Regarding public external debt, in 2003, the authorities established a debt committee to
monitor Benin’s external debt situation, review proposals for new external loans, and make
recommendations on alternative financing sources.4 Benin’s external debt-to-GDP ratio
declined from an average of 55 percent in 2000-02 to about 36 percent in 2003, owing in
particular to debt relief after reaching the completion point under the enhanced HIPC
Initiative in March 2003.
7.
Domestic credit expanded rapidly in 2002-03, driven by credit to the private
sector. Consequently, the Central Bank of West African States BCEAO, which conducts the
regional monetary policy, increased the reserve requirement of the banks in Benin in
February 2004 (from 9 to 13 percent).5
8.
The financial health of the banking sector remained broadly sound (Appendix I).
Banks' profitability improved substantially in recent years and their compliance with
prudential ratios was broadly satisfactory, except for concentration risk.
9.
Progress in structural reforms continued to be slow. The civil service reform,
designed with the support of the World Bank in 1998, stalled due to strong opposition from
trade unions and the parliament. In the meantime, to prevent an expansion in public sector
employment, the government has applied since early 2003 a recruitment policy based on
fixed-term contracts to replace retiring civil servants. Also, the implementation of the
divestiture program for the public utilities and the Port of Cotonou did not progress
significantly. In the cotton sector, the current framework defining the relationship among the
various stakeholders—input importers and distributors, farmers, and ginners—has been
under stress, with an adverse impact on the 2003/2004 crop season.6 At present, a private
4

Government domestic debt has remained very low (about 0.8 percent of GDP at end-2003).

5

The measured level of currency in circulation in Benin has shown some erratic swings,
probably due to errors in estimating how much of the currency issued to Benin is in the
vaults of the BCEAO. The BCEAO takes a long time in sorting out its currency holdings
across countries of issuance; the BCEAO intends to allocate additional resources to shorten
this lag.
6

Under a reform process supported by the World Bank, Benin's cotton sector has moved
from an integrated state monopoly in the late 1980s to one with substantial private
participation (See the section on The Cotton Sector Reform in Benin in the "Selected Issues
and Statistical Appendix”). But the reform is unfinished; in particular, the allocation of seed
cotton to ginners is decided administratively on the basis of installed capacity, as a way of
ensuring a minimum level of activity in each ginning company (as there is excess ginning
capacity in the system).

-8-

institution (CSPR), representing the interests of all the stakeholders, is in charge of selling
the farmers’ output, collecting payments from ginners, using part of the proceeds to pay back
input credit (that farmers received from input importers and distributors), and paying the
remainder to farmers. Recently, a significant share of transactions started to take place
outside this “regular” system.7 This generated financial problems for the CSPR—as it
continued to be responsible for paying back all input credits but could not collect from some
of the farmers—which delayed the start of the crop season. The negative impact on output
arising from this delay was reportedly compounded by low yields resulting from low-quality
inputs purchased outside the regular system. Also in the cotton sector, the process of
privatizing the public ginning company (SONAPRA), a key element of the structural reform
strategy, resumed in December 2003, but was not completed by mid-June 2004 as scheduled.
10.
Together with the other countries of the WAEMU, Benin maintained a liberal trade
and payments system. The common external tariff (CET), which was implemented in 2000,
has established four rates (0, 5, 10, and 20 percent) while dismantling internal tariff barriers
within the WAEMU area. Nontariff barriers were eliminated at the same time (Box 1).
III. DISCUSSIONS WITH THE AUTHORITIES
A. Overview
11.
The discussions took place in a context of a slowdown in GDP growth and a
shortfall in tax revenues that resulted from an intensification of import restrictions
from Nigeria and a poor cotton crop—despite high export prices. Cotton production was
about 17 percent lower than anticipated, owing to the poor functioning of the new private
institutions overseeing the payment of seed cotton and inputs, as mentioned above. Also,
Nigeria increased import restrictions and strengthened customs controls in late 2003 (Box 2).
As a result of these developments, real GDP growth in 2004 is now projected at 3 percent.
Also, government revenue was 17 percent lower than expected for the first quarter of 2004.8
Inflation remained subdued (the consumer price index increased by 0.8 percent in the first
half of 2004).

7

In “irregular” sales of seed cotton, farmers avoid the deduction that the CSPR would make
to pay back their input credits, and ginners get to use some of their excess capacity.
Regarding “irregular” sale of inputs, input distributors were reportedly dissatisfied with the
bidding system used to allocate import orders.
8

The revenue shortfall was almost entirely recorded at customs, reflecting the impact of
import restrictions by Nigeria. Those restrictions led to a marked drop in Benin’s imports of
goods destined to be reexported to Nigeria, which are subject to tariffs in the higher brackets.

-9-

Box 1. Benin: Trade Policy
•

Benin’s trade policy is largely determined by its membership in WAEMU, and
the country has maintained a liberal trade and payments system. The WAEMU
common external tariff (CET), composed of four rates (0, 5, 10, and 20 percent), was
introduced in 2000, and at that time internal tariff barriers within the WAEMU area
were dismantled. Benin has also taken the necessary steps to comply with the regional
nomenclature. The simple average tariff rate is 14.6 percent, lower than the average for
sub-Saharan African countries (17.6 percent). All the rates applied are ad valorem.
Overall, Benin’s trade restrictiveness is rated 2 out of 10 (1 being the least restrictive)
by the Fund, and it does not have any formal nontariff barriers.

•

Non-WAEMU members of the Economic Community of West African States
(ECOWAS) have agreed to give preferential treatment for the same products as those
in WAEMU, and to liberalize intraregional trade starting on January 1, 2004.1/

•

Customs procedures remain burdensome, and the implementation of the CET was
associated with continued fraud and corruption, including undervaluation of imports.
Actions have been taken recently to apply transaction values to all imports, and fight
smuggling in accordance with IMF technical assistance recommendations. However,
corruption and the lack of control over exemptions remain major concerns.

•

Most of the external trade goes through the Port of Cotonou, which has been poorly
managed for a long time. The situation has reportedly started to improve, following the
introduction of an action plan and the appointment of a new director in early 2004.

•

Benin, together with Burkina Faso, Mali, and Chad, cosponsored the “Sectoral
Initiative in Favor of Cotton” in the current round of the World Trade Organization
(WTO) multilateral negotiations. The initiative calls for the phasing out of support for
cotton production, with a view to its total elimination, and financial compensation for
cotton producing least developed countries (LDCs) to offset their loss of revenue in the
meantime. In July 2004, the WTO General Council agreed on an agricultural
framework for further negotiations within which this initiative will receive specific
attention.

•

Benin has preferential access to the USA market (through the U.S. Generalized System
of Preferences) and to European Union (through the Cotonou Convention, and
Everything-but-Arms Initiative). Benin has already received a visa for clothing exports
to the U.S. in early 2004, in the context of the African Growth and Opportunity Act
(AGOA). Prospects for a rapid increase in clothing exports appear to be limited in the
near future, because the domestic textile industry is small and lacks competitiveness;
however, the authorities have initiated discussions at the regional level to examine how
to develop a competitive clothing industry.

Box 2. Benin: Exports to Nigeria
In addition to formal bilateral trade and reexport activities, there are sizable informal trade
flows between Benin and Nigeria. Total exports from Benin to Nigeria include:
•

Formal exports, which are small (less than 1 percent of GDP);

•

Formal reexports (goods destined for Nigeria imported through the Port of Cotonou),
which are significant in magnitude (equivalent to 7½ percent of GDP in 2002-03),
generate about 2.5 percent of Benin’s total tax revenues;1

•

Informal reexports, which comprise goods imported for the domestic market and
subsequently informally reexported to Nigeria by Nigerian and Beninese traders. The
main factor driving this trade is Nigeria’s restrictive and volatile trade policies.2 While
hard data on informal exports to Nigeria are lacking, rough estimates suggest that they
could amount to about 6 percent of GDP and generate about one-third of customs
revenues.

Recent Developments
At the end of 2003, Nigeria introduced an import prohibition list comprising 44 items; these
measures were intended to protect domestic industries and the activity of Nigerian ports, and to
address sanitary concerns regarding frozen meat imported through Benin.3 At the same time,
the border controls were considerably strengthened. This has resulted in a significant drop in
port traffic since the beginning of 2004 (a 20 percent decline during January–April 2004,
compared to the same period in 2003), mostly affecting textiles, poultry, and manufactured
goods destined to reexport to Nigeria.
Since June 2004, Benin has engaged in formal negotiations with Nigeria to have the import
prohibition removed. The current status of agreement is that the prohibition list will stay in
effect for products originally imported to Benin but not for those locally produced.
___________________________________
1/ A number of major consumption goods are taxed at a total rate of 14.62 percent. All other products
are taxed at a rate of 6.05 percent under the ordinary transit regime.
2/ Nigeria’s average tariff rate is 37.2 percent against 14.6 percent for Benin, and it has a Fund trade
restrictiveness index of 8 in a scale 1-10 (10 representing the most restrictive) against 2 for Benin.
3/ The list mainly encompasses agricultural products and beverages and a number of manufactured
products including textiles, bicycles, and furniture.

12.
In the circumstances, discussions focused on remedial actions to address the
causes and consequences of the weakness in economic activity this year, and the policies
needed to achieve the authorities' medium-term objectives. In line with the PRSP, these
objectives are to set the economy on the path to stronger growth, with a view to reducing
poverty and achieving the MDGs, while consolidating the gains made over the last years in
restoring macroeconomic stability.

14.
The authorities recognized that the weak economic activity since the beginning
of 2004 and the risks of sustained import restrictions by Nigeria warranted a moderate
downward revision in the PRSP path for economic growth. Their objective is now to
raise real GDP growth gradually, from a lower base in 2004 (3 percent, against 6 percent in
the original PRSP) toward the 7 percent growth target set in the PRSP, through a rebound in
cotton production, improved overall economic efficiency (Box 3), and an increase in
investment.9 Inflation would remain at about 3 percent (the regional target), while the
external current account deficit would narrow to 8 percent of GDP after initially widening in
2004 because of the lower-than-expected export of cotton and reexports to Nigeria. The staff
stressed that reaching these objectives would require the continuation of prudent fiscal and
monetary policies as well as an acceleration of structural reforms.
B. Fiscal Policy
15.
To compensate for the shortfall in government revenue in 2004, the authorities
decided to take strong fiscal actions. They plan to strengthen tax administration and cut
total spending by 1.4 percent of GDP while protecting, to the extent possible, priority

The mission concurred with the authorities that while the projected level of public
investment was appropriate, there was a need for a steady increase in private sector
investment, which stagnated in recent years.

spending.10 These measures, if implemented rapidly and forcefully, would permit to limit the
overall fiscal deficit to 5½ percent of GDP in 2004.11 The mission stressed, however, that
further measures might be needed to contain the deficit at the revised level if revenue
weaknesses persisted in the coming months.

16.
Over the medium term, fiscal policy will seek to support the authorities’ poverty
reduction strategy while maintaining debt sustainability. On the revenue side, the
emphasis will be on combating tax evasion, collecting tax arrears, and continuing to simplify
procedures, in line with recent Fund technical assistance recommendations to strengthen the
tax and customs administrations. At customs, special attention would be paid to controlling
exemptions, applying the WTO valuation rules to all imports, and fighting smuggling, fraud,

10

The authorities indicated that they were not contemplating anymore the adoption of a
supplementary budget to provide expenditure for the junior Pan-African soccer games, which
Benin will host in 2005, and that they intended to limit the budget outlay for this project to
the existing budgetary allocation.
11

To monitor the fiscal situation, the authorities updated their quarterly indicative targets for
2004 (Table 15).

- 13 -

and corruption. The implementation of these measures should allow revenues to come back
gradually to the level of 17 percent of GDP reached in 2002-03.
17.
On the expenditure side, the authorities will seek to reflect PRSP priorities in
budgetary allocations, while keeping total outlays stable in terms of GDP. To increase
the execution of priority poverty-reducing expenditures, annual budgets will be underpinned
by the Medium-Term Expenditure Framework (MTEF) being updated with the support of the
World Bank. The wage bill would be kept at 5 percent of GDP by containing wage increases,
and the growth in nonpriority spending would be curbed, notably by strengthening the
measures to limit wasteful spending on public utilities. In this respect, the reforms underway
in public expenditure management will be completed in order to improve the monitoring of
budget execution, and enhance transparency and the tracking of poverty-reducing public
outlays, in line with the recent Fund technical assistance recommendations.12
18.
The authorities were confident that the financing of the resulting deficit would
continue to be covered by grants and highly concessional loans in order to preserve debt
sustainability. Such financing from donors is critical to support the implementation of the
poverty reduction strategy. The fiscal deficit (excluding grants) is envisaged to decline
gradually from 5½ percent of GDP in 2004 to 4.7 percent of GDP in 2007. The authorities
indicated that existing commitments by major donors in the form of grants and highly
concessional loans covered about 85 percent of the projected financing gap for 2005. The
mission stressed that the mobilization of the required financing will necessitate continued
progress in the implementation of the PRSP to satisfy donors’ conditionality.
19.
The authorities concurred with the staff that achieving the revised medium-term
fiscal objectives will require continued efforts on several fronts. In particular, the
authorities will need to resist pressures to grant unplanned wage increases or incur
extrabudgetary expenditures, and improve the monitoring and evaluation of priority
expenditure. The authorities also agreed that there is a need to strengthen the capacity of the
local governments in budget management so that the transfer of fiscal competencies
envisaged in the coming years does not weaken expenditure control. The authorities
reiterated that—if undertaken—the large projects (port and airport) envisaged under the fiveyear Government Action Program for the period 2001-06 would be effected under BOT
(build-operate-transfer) contracts with private companies. In addition, they indicated that—
before deciding whether to proceed with these projects—they would conduct an assessment
of their macroeconomic and fiscal impact, and would discuss the results with the IMF and
World Bank staffs.

12

The reforms include a limitation of exceptional procedures for budgetary expenditure and
the integration of all commitments generated by public procurement contracts into SIGFIP.

- 14 -

C. Structural Reforms
20.
The authorities recognized that a new impetus in the implementation of the
structural reform agenda was needed to reach their medium-term objectives. While in
the past the pace of reform suffered from lack of political consensus and insufficient
coordination within the government, the current government’s majority in parliament offers
an opportunity to move forward with pending reforms. The main elements of the agenda are
the cotton sector reform, the divestiture program, and the civil service reform.
21.
To avoid the recurrence of the disturbances experienced in the 2003/04 cotton
crop campaign, the authorities plan to strengthen the institutions in charge of seed
cotton and input commercialization, on the basis of measures devised with the support of
the World Bank. These include immediate actions to prevent the re-emergence of a parallel
circuit for input provision and sale of seed cotton, as well as the establishment, before the
start of the 2004/05 harvest season, of a regulatory framework defining the role and
responsibilities of the government and the stakeholders.13 The mission recognized that the
implementation of these measures would help ensure a better functioning of the current
framework during the forthcoming cotton campaign. At the same time, however, the mission
encouraged the authorities to plan the next steps of the reform in order to have a successful
transition from the current administrative allocation of seed cotton to a system based on
competition among ginners. In doing so, the authorities would benefit from the results of the
poverty and social impact analysis (PSIA) of the cotton sector reforms, undertaken with the
support of the World Bank, which is scheduled to be completed by end-2004.
22.
The authorities reiterated their commitment to pursue the divestiture program,
and the mission stressed the need to establish a credible agenda accordingly. The agenda
for public utilities is still lacking—except for the electricity company, which benefits from
the assistance of the World Bank. The privatization process for SONAPRA was not
completed by mid-June as scheduled. The authorities explained that the delay regarding
SONAPRA was needed to ensure transparency, but they were confident the process would be
completed in the coming weeks. The authorities also explained that they had started
implementing a plan to improve the management of the Port of Cotonou to make it more
efficient and competitive. The mission encouraged the authorities to rapidly reach a
consensus, among the government and with the unions, on a new agenda for the involvement
13

The authorities have agreed with input distributors on their individual zones of operations,
so that the distribution of inputs could start without further delays. They also launched a
study on the improvement of the bidding process for inputs with a view to establishing the
new process by year-end with the support of the World Bank and the French Cooperation.
The new regulatory framework would also establish sanctions against those operating outside
the normal procedures. Clearly, incentives for "irregular" transactions in seed cotton would
be reduced by allocating seed cotton through competition among ginners (rather than
administratively) and by enforcing the payment of input credit by farmers.

- 15 -

of the private sector in the management of the Port of Cotonou. It also stressed the
importance of improving the regulatory framework of the telecommunications sector to
facilitate the privatization of the telecommunications company; and the need to strengthen
the divestiture procedures and the privatization unit to ensure timeliness and transparency, as
recommended by the World Bank.
23.
The authorities are preparing a new administrative and civil service
management reform with the assistance of the World Bank. This reform would include:
(i) a revised performance-based promotion and remuneration system to improve the quality
and efficiency of public services; and (ii) moderate salary increases. Ongoing discussions
with the unions bode well for achieving a consensus on the reform, but the government
recently suffered a setback in establishing the needed legal framework.14 The staff
encouraged the authorities to refrain from granting further wage increases before the
implementation of the new compensation and promotion system. It also stressed the need to
rapidly formulate a strategy regarding the medium-and long-term financial viability of the
civil service pension fund (FNRB) and, as a first step, to complete the actuarial study for the
FNRB.
24.
The authorities also intend to improve the business environment through a
forceful implementation of the strategy to fight corruption adopted in 2002 and the
strengthening of the legal and judiciary system, which is supported by the World Bank and
other donors (Box 4). In parallel, they plan to carry out a diagnostic study of impediments to
private sector development, as a basis for a strategy to be adopted and implemented in close
collaboration with the private sector. The authorities concurred with the mission on the need
to address the lack of land titling—which limits access to credit—and they intended to
request technical assistance from the World Bank to that effect.
D. Monetary Policy and Financial Sector Issues
25.
The staff agreed with the authorities that WAEMU's monetary policy
arrangement has served Benin well. It has helped to maintain confidence in the currency
and keep inflation low. Regional monetary policy will continue to aim at preserving the
parity of the CFA franc vis-à-vis the euro by maintaining an adequate level of foreign
reserves. In that context, Benin is expected to contribute again positively to the buildup of
foreign assets of the BCEAO, as the increase in credit to the private sector is contained and
the government pursues a prudent fiscal policy.
26.
The staff recommended that the BCEAO use open market operations as the
main instrument of monetary policy and abandon the system of differential reserve
14

In April 2004, the Supreme Court rejected the draft law establishing a single statute for
government employees covering both civil servants and contractual employees, a prerequisite
for implementing the reform. The authorities are considering their next steps.

Box 4. Benin: Governance and Business Environment
According to available international assessments, Benin’s governance and business environment
indicators are broadly at par with sub-Saharan African averages, but still far below best performers in the
region. In the area of governance, Benin's performance is strong regarding political stability and voice and
accountability.

To fight corruption, the government adopted a national strategy in July 2002. In this framework, detailed
procurement reports that include all calls for tender, tender evaluation reports, and tender awards have
been regularly published since the beginning of 2003. Benin's first Governance and Corruption Survey is
underway and expected to be completed by the end of the year. To strengthen the legal and judicial sector,
an ambitious ten-year program was adopted in 2001. A first implementation plan, covering the period
2005–07, has been prepared and will be reflected in the three-year program-budget under preparation.

requirements by country in favor of a unified system.15 However, the authorities stressed
that the monetary policy had to be tailored to the liquidity situation of each country as long as
the region's financial markets were not integrated, and that the reserve requirement as defined
by the BCEAO permitted to control undue expansion of short-term credit and transfer of
funds abroad.16
27.
The mission concurred with the authorities that Benin's financial sector was
generally sound, while pointing to areas where additional efforts were warranted. In
particular, the authorities recognized they should aim at further improving compliance with
prudential ratios, fostering the supervision of microfinance institutions, and deepening
financial intermediation, including through the strengthening of the legal and judicial system
(Appendix 1).17 The authorities explained that the bidding process for the divestiture of the
government's shares in Continental Bank—the only remaining bank with government
participation—was unsuccessful; there were no bidders, reportedly because the sale of
minority shares was not attractive to investors. The authorities are planning to relaunch the
bidding soon, selling the government's shares jointly with those of the BOAD (West African
Development Bank), which together amount to 52 percent of total shares.
E. Poverty Reduction Strategy
28.
The authorities indicated that their poverty reduction strategy, in accordance
with the PRSP, envisaged reaching a higher and sustained growth rate, while
reinforcing macroeconomic stability, improving the efficiency and transparency of
public spending, and making the economy less vulnerable to external shocks. The staff
concurred with the authorities that achieving these objectives would require: (i) accelerating
the implementation of structural reforms, as they are key to raising productivity and
improving public service delivery; (ii) encouraging private investment in order to foster
economic growth and diversification, in particular through improved governance and
judiciary system; and (iii) increasing the level and quality of government outlays, while
curbing nonpriority expenditures.
29.
The authorities recognized that reaching the MDGs by 2015 will, however,
remain a significant challenge, particularly in the areas where progress has been slow.
To this end, the authorities intend to strengthen their policies designed to improve the
delivery, quality, and coverage of basic services. These include access to safe water in

regional institutions (Country Report 03/70).

rural areas, basic health and education services, and agricultural services. Sectoral programs
in these areas will be designed to take account of the complementarity and the potential
synergy among them. The World Bank─in the framework of the Poverty Reduction Support
Credit (PRSC)─and other donors have indicated their commitment to provide assistance in
these areas. The staff stressed that implementing the structural reform agenda was critical to
reduce poverty, as these reforms were crucial for improving farmers’ revenue from cotton
and service delivery for public utilities.
30.
The authorities have made progress in addressing the shortcomings of the PRSP
identified in the joint staff assessment (JSA). To improve the poverty diagnosis, a national
household survey on living conditions has been conducted, and a PSIA of cotton sector
reforms is being prepared with the assistance of the World Bank. Also, the mechanism for
monitoring and evaluating the PRSP implementation is being strengthened, with the support
of bilateral donors.
31.
In parallel, the authorities are assessing progress in implementing the poverty
reduction strategy presented in the PRSP and evaluating the execution of povertyreducing outlays. In light of this assessment, the authorities will revise the targets and
policies presented in the PRSP, which they will present in the first annual progress report of
the implementation of the PRSP, scheduled to be finalized during the last quarter of 2004.
The progress report would take into account the adverse impact of the weaker-than-expected
economic activity and government expenditure cuts in 2004.
F. External Sector and Debt Sustainability
32.
The staff stressed that, even assuming strong policy implementation, Benin will
remain highly vulnerable to external shocks in the short and medium term. These
shocks include, in particular, a drop in the price of cotton (which remains volatile), and
unfavorable changes in Nigerian trade policy. Also, a further appreciation of the euro vis-àvis the U.S. dollar would worsen the competitiveness of Benin’s external sector.18
33.
To reduce the vulnerability of Benin’s economy to external shocks, the
authorities plan to promote export diversification, while maintaining a liberal trade and
exchange system. Although cotton exports remain the main cash crop, export diversification
has made some progress in recent years, as the share of noncotton products in total exports of
goods—mainly cashew nuts, wood products, and staple agricultural products—has increased
from a low level of 16 percent in average during 1994-99 to 29 percent in average during
2000-03. The authorities reiterated the PRSP’s objective of creating an enabling environment
for a competitive industrial sector focused on agro-industry, particularly for local processing
of cotton fiber into textile. They concurred with the staff that responding to the challenge of
18

In 2003, Benin’s main export markets were Asian developing countries (67 percent of total
exports), African countries (14 percent), and the European Union (10 percent).

- 19 -

export diversification will require the acceleration of structural reforms and the promotion of
a dynamic private sector.
34.
Regarding trade policy, the authorities have taken the necessary steps to comply
with the regional directives on the implementation of the common external tariff. Benin
benefits from the import duty exemptions arising from the Cotonou Convention in its trade
with the European Union, and is eligible for the benefits of AGOA in its trade with the
United States. However, the authorities are concerned by the rising cotton subsidies in
industrial countries and, jointly with other West African countries, they launched the Sectoral
Initiative on Cotton calling for their elimination in the context of the current round of WTO
multilateral negotiations, as this would significantly boost Benin’s exports and help reduce
poverty. In July 2004, the WTO General Council agreed on an agricultural framework for
further negotiations within which this initiative will receive specific attention.
35.
The authorities indicated that an acceleration of structural reforms would help
strengthen external competitiveness, which had deteriorated in recent years owing to the
real exchange rate appreciation and the so far slow pace of reforms that would enhance the
efficiency of the export sector.19 In particular, the divestiture of public utilities, private sector
management of the Port of Cotonou, streamlining the regulatory framework, and
strengthening the judicial system could all help to reduce the costs of doing business and
enhance efficiency. In addition, progress in civil service reform could help maintain wage
restraint. The staff pointed out that a further strengthening of the euro—to which the
CFA franc is pegged—may pose risks for the economy, and stressed that this prospect
heightened the need for a careful monitoring of a range of competitiveness indicators.
36.
The DSA update confirms that, based on the policies underlying the mediumterm scenario, Benin’s external debt would remain on a sustainable path. The baseline
scenario, which reflects the authorities’ revised macroeconomic framework for 2004-07 and
conservative macroeconomic assumptions beyond 2007,20 leads to the same conclusion as the
19

The analysis of Benin’s external competitiveness, conducted in the “Selected Issues and
Statistical Appendix” report, gives some preliminary indication that the real appreciation of
the exchange rate since 2000 would have brought it above its underlying equilibrium value.
The impact of the appreciation of the exchange rate on external trade has, however, been
limited, because of the heavy weight of trade with the euro zone, exports of manufactured
goods remain marginal, and the world price for cotton improved considerably starting in
2002 (the volume of cotton exports—and its share in the world market has remained stable
since the mid-1990s).

20

Exports of goods and nonfactor services are projected to remain weak during 2004-07,
reaching an average of 13.7 percent of GDP, compared with an average of about 15 percent
of GDP anticipated at completion point, and an historical average of about 16 percent over
the last ten years. They are assumed to reach an average of about 14.5 percent of GDP during
2008-21 (1 percentage point below the level projected at completion point).

- 20 -

completion point document that the NPV of debt-to-exports ratio would remain below the
150 percent threshold from 2005 onward (Table 8). The debt service is also projected to be
sustainable, with a debt service-to-exports ratio hovering around 6.5 percent in 2004-23.
37.
At the same time, however, the sensitivity analysis highlights a clear potential for
major shocks (reflecting external shocks or domestic policy slippages) to push the debt
toward unsustainable levels. The implications of three major risks facing Benin were
examined, namely: (i) a drop in exports, reflecting external shocks; (ii) a lax fiscal policy,
resulting in higher expenditure than in the baseline scenario; and (iii) less favorable terms on
new borrowings, reflecting difficulties in mobilizing concessional financial support. In each
of the three alternative scenarios, the NPV of debt-to-exports ratio would remain above the
150 percent threshold during a protracted period (Table 9 and Figure 4).
38.
In light of these results, the authorities concurred with the staff on the
importance of enhancing export diversification, containing public sector deficit, and
improving debt management in order to achieve and maintain external debt
sustainability. In this respect, the authorities indicated that the monitoring of external debt
will be strengthened through the debt committee established in 2003 so as to avoid the
recurrence of larger-than-anticipated new borrowing, as experienced in 2000–02.21 In
parallel, they were pursuing efforts to obtain debt relief from all non-Paris Club creditors
under the enhanced HIPC Initiative (Box 5).
G. Statistical Issues and Technical Assistance
39.
Benin’s statistical database is fairly comprehensive but needs strengthening in
the areas of national accounts, balance of payments, public finance, monetary statistics, and
social indicators (Appendix III). The deficiencies do not hamper, however, the ability of the
Fund staff to conduct effective surveillance of economic policies. Benin participates in the
Fund’s General Data Dissemination System (GDDS), and in consultation with the Fund staff,
has set out plans for the improvement of its statistical database. The authorities requested
technical assistance from the Fund to improve the balance of payments statistics; a mission
has been scheduled for late 2004. Benin will also continue to benefit from technical
assistance from West AFRITAC in the area of tax and customs administration, income
taxation, public expenditure management, and statistics. The authorities are in the process of
implementing the set of rules harmonizing the methodology for compiling the national
accounts among WAEMU countries. They have also started implementing the action plan to
address methodological weaknesses in compiling poverty data and other social indicators.

21

These efforts have already permitted to increase the share of grants in the financing of
projects from an average of 29 percent during 2000-02 to about 48 percent in 2003.

- 21 -

Box 5. Benin: External Debt and the Paris Club Rescheduling
After reaching the completion point under the enhanced HIPC Initiative in March 2003, 1 the
government of Benin concluded an agreement with Paris Club creditors, in April 2003, on the
provision of completion point assistance. The participating creditors were the governments of
France, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, Norway, the Russian Federation, and the United
Kingdom. The meeting was attended by representatives of Belgium, Canada, Japan, and the
USA, who participated as observers. As of March 1, 2003, the stock of debt due to Paris Club
creditors was estimated at US$159 million in end-1998 NPV terms, of which US$108 million
constituted pre-cut-off- date non-Official Development Assistance (non-ODA) and US$51
million post-cut-off-date debt.
To deliver the Paris Club’s share in completion point assistance to Benin, creditors decided to
cancel US$48 million of previously rescheduled non-ODA debt (in NPV terms). The effort
on top of Naples terms was achieved by some countries, through a cancellation of 42 percent
of pre-cut-off-date non-ODA debt. This came on top of the US$12 million assistance
delivered in the form of interim assistance. The agreement includes a clause committing the
government of Benin to not accord any category of creditors a treatment more favorable than
that accorded to Paris Club creditors.
As of end-June 2004, Benin had concluded bilateral debt relief agreements with all Paris Club
members. Six of these creditors (Germany, the Netherlands, Norway, France, Italy, and the
United Kingdom) agreed to cancel, outside the framework of the Paris Club, 100 percent of
the remaining outstanding debt.
The government has requested all its multilateral and bilateral non-Paris Club creditors to
provide debt relief consistent with the HIPC Initiative. Understandings have been reached
with almost all the multilateral institutions on providing the debt relief, including the IMF,
the African Development Bank, the World Bank, the West African Development Bank, the
Arab Bank for Economic Development in Africa, the European Investment Bank, the
International Fund for Agricultural Development, and the Islamic Development Bank—
creditors representing about 80 percent of nominal debt owed by Benin at-end 2001. As
regards non-Paris Club creditors, an agreement has been reached with the Kuwait Fund.
Negotiations are ongoing with the other bilateral non-Paris Club creditors and remaining
multilateral creditors.
_______________________
1/ As indicated in the completion point document (“Benin—Enhanced Initiative for Heavily
Indebted Poor Countries—Completion Point Document;” Country Report 03/189), Benin’s
total outstanding debt at end-2001 was estimated at about US$1.37 billion in nominal terms
(about 59 percent of 2001 GDP) and US$857 million in NPV terms. Approximately 82
percent of the debt in nominal terms was owed to multilateral creditors, 13 percent to Paris
Club creditors, and 5 percent to non-Paris Club bilateral creditors. The only outstanding
commercial debt had been settled through a buyback operation on terms comparable to those
obtained from the Paris Club.

IV. EX POST ASSESSMENT OF PERFORMANCE AND FUTURE ROLE OF THE FUND
40.
The authorities, as well as the representatives of the private sector and of the
donor community in Benin, concurred with the thrust of the ex post assessment (EPA),
which was prepared recently by an interdepartmental team (Box 6). They stressed that a
further PRGF arrangement with low access would help Benin in addressing the challenges in
the Fund's core areas of responsibility, facilitate the mobilization of concessional
international financial support to finance its development agenda, and provide a framework
for a sound policy response in case of exogenous shocks.
41.
The authorities agreed with the staff that continued Fund involvement would
rest on pursuing fiscal consolidation—while increasing the level and quality of povertyreducing spending, and improving governance at customs—as well as accelerating the
implementation of the reform agenda. The staff indicated that the Fund would continue to
focus on its core areas of reform expertise, notably domestic revenue mobilization, public
resource management, external debt management, and integrating the PRSP into a sound
multiyear macroeconomic framework, while keeping its close collaboration with the World
Bank, which would be expected to play a lead role in a number of other reform areas.
V. STAFF APPRAISAL
42.
Over 2001-03, economic performance was broadly satisfactory. Benin continued
to display strong economic growth and low inflation; and the fiscal stance remained
appropriate. However, progress on the structural front has been slow, Benin's external
competitiveness has deteriorated, and the economy has remained vulnerable to external
shocks.
43.
Economic performance in 2004 has been adversely affected by an intensification
of import restrictions from Nigeria and a poor cotton crop—resulting from the weak
functioning of the institutions overseeing the marketing of seed cotton and inputs. As a result,
real GDP growth is projected to slow down this year to 3 percent, tax revenue would be
lower than-anticipated, and the external current account deficit would widen moderately.
44.
The authorities need to implement forcefully the planned adjustment measures
in the fiscal area to contain the deterioration of the fiscal situation that started at the
beginning of the year. However, further measures may be necessary to contain the deficit if
weaknesses in revenue collection continue.
45.
For the medium term, it would be important that the authorities move resolutely
in implementing the required measures in order to regain the high and sustained
growth path necessary to reduce poverty and make progress toward achieving the
MDGs. These measures, in the areas of fiscal policy, structural reforms and the private sector
development, are designed to improve the economy's efficiency while preserving and
reinforcing macroeconomic stability.

- 23 -

Box 6. Benin: Overview of the Ex Post Assessment of Benin’s Performance
Under Fund-Supported Programs
Overview of performance
Program implementation during 1993-2003 was broadly successful. Real economic growth averaged
5 percent. Inflation remained subdued. Fiscal consolidation improved substantially, as the key initial
challenges arising from the low level of revenue collection and the high level of the wage bill were
addressed. Implementation of the regional common external tariff, however, was reportedly associated
with fraud and corruption.
Overall progress in structural reform was mixed. While initial efforts to liberalize the economy and
reduce government intervention were successful, and there was significant progress in introducing farreaching reforms to liberalize the cotton sector, further reforms, including the divestiture program for
public utilities and the civil service reform incurred protracted delays.
Regarding program design, some of the challenges posed by the shortcomings in reforms, including in
particular governance problems in customs and the slippage in civil service reform, were not addressed in
a timely manner. Programs could also have placed an earlier emphasis on the need to strengthen debt
management capacity. Furthermore, Benin's mixed record of structural policy implementation has been
indicative of incomplete program ownership, lapses in coordination, and weak institutional and

Conclusions and recommendations
In accordance with the objectives of the PRSP, the main challenge for the future is to reach a higher and
sustained growth and reduce poverty, while preserving and reinforcing macroeconomic stability and
making the economy less vulnerable to external shocks. This will require continuation of fiscal
consolidation while increasing poverty-reducing spending, and enhanced efforts to implement the
uncompleted reform agenda.
A further PRGF arrangement with low access would help assist Benin in addressing the challenges in the
Fund's core areas of responsibility, facilitate the securing of concessional international financial support
to finance the development agenda, and provide a framework for sound policy response in case of
exogenous shocks. This successor arrangement, however, should have as a key objective Benin's
graduation from the use of Fund resources upon its completion.
Drawing on the evaluation of the design and implementation of past Fund-supported programs, a future
program should tackle the ownership issue through improved transparency and consensus building, build
in safeguards to minimize risks to structural reform implementation, and help improve the policy
response to external shocks.

46.
Achieving the revised medium-term fiscal objectives will require continued
efforts to boost revenue collection and increase the level and quality of povertyreducing spending, while curbing nonpriority expenditure. To that effect, the authorities
intend to implement forcefully the action plans aimed at improving the performance of tax
and customs administrations, ensuring that budgetary allocations reflect PRSP priorities, and
refraining from providing further wage increases before the implementation of a new
compensation system. In parallel, to improve the efficiency and transparency of public
spending, they would complete the reforms under way in public expenditure management.
47.
A new impetus in the implementation of the uncompleted reform agenda is
needed, to make the economy more competitive and improve the delivery of services to
the population. It would be important that the authorities establish a credible agenda for the
divestiture program and implement it in a timely and transparent manner, and that they adopt
and implement a new administrative and civil service management reform. In the cotton
sector, the authorities intend to strengthen the new institutions in charge of seed cotton and
input commercialization, to avoid further disturbances; they are encouraged to plan the next
steps of the reform in parallel. Adherence to these reforms is essential to strengthen
competitiveness in the context of a fixed exchange rate.
48.
To promote the development of the private sector, the authorities intend to
improve the business environment. This will require a forceful implementation of the
national strategy to fight corruption and of the program to strengthen the legal and judiciary
system, as well as better governance and transparency at customs.
49.
Export diversification is expected to benefit from the acceleration of reforms and
the liberal trade and payments system. Benin's external position would be further
strengthened if the high cotton subsidies from the world's major cotton-producing countries
and import restrictions from Nigeria were discontinued.
50.
The authorities intend to continue to strengthen the financial sector. While the
health of the banking sector has been generally sound, it would be important to remain
vigilant to ensure that all banks comply with the Regional Banking Commission's prudential
ratios.
51.
The updated debt sustainability analysis stressed the need for Benin to continue to
follow a very prudent debt-management policy, in order to stay on a sustainable path. This
would also help mitigate the potential downside risks relating to potential shocks.
52.
It would be important that the authorities complete the first annual assessment
of the implementation of their poverty reduction strategy promptly. In the meantime, the
authorities should continue addressing the shortcomings of the PRSP outlined in the JSA.
53.
It is recommended that the next Article IV consultation be held on the standard
12-month consultation cycle.

1/ Assumes that the interest rate on new borrowing is by 2 percentage points higher than in the baseline, while grace and maturity periods are the same as in the baseline.
2/ Exports values are assumed to remain permanently at the lower level, but the current account as a share of GDP is assumed to return to its baseline level after the shock (implicitly assuming
an offsetting adjustment in import levels).
3/ Includes official and private transfers and foreign direct investment (FDI).
4/ Applies to all stress scenarios except for B1 (less favorable financing) in which the terms on all new financing are as specified in footnote 1.

APPENDIX I

Benin: Financial Sector Developments and Issues
The Beninese financial system consists of eight commercial banks (which account for about
90 percent of the total financial sector assets), two leasing companies, eight insurance
companies, and over 100 formal microfinance institutions. There is also a very small postal
bank and two state-run pension schemes. Domestic securities markets are virtually
nonexistent; very few Beninese companies use the securities regional market in Abidjan.
The banking sector
•

A banking sector based on private sector ownership was established following the
collapse of the state-owned banks at the end of 1980s. The new banks quickly gained
public’s confidence; bank deposits and credit increased rapidly, from 4 percent and 0.2
percent of GDP in 1989 to 20 percent and 14.5 percent of GDP in 2003, respectively.

•

The Beninese banking sector is concentrated; the largest three banks account for over
three fourths of total deposits as well as credits. However, competition is increasing as
new banks are entering the market. All banks except one are privately owned, and the
state’s shares in the remaining bank are being sold. Foreign ownership is prominent.

•

Profitability has improved in recent years. Over the period 2000-03, return on equity
increased from 10.6 percent to 36.7 percent, while return on assets rose from 0.4 percent
to 2.1 percent. All banks, except for two small ones, posted profits in 2003. Average
operating efficiency is about 50 percent, in line with international standards. This partly
reflects high intermediation margins (about 10 percent).

•

Compliance with prudential norms is broadly satisfactory, except for the risk
concentration, reflecting the lack of diversification of the economy. The two largest
banks, accounting for about two-thirds of bank deposits and credit, comply with all
prudential norms. The ratio of nonperforming loans (5.4 percent) is among the lowest in
the region.

•

Banking supervision is conducted by the regional Banking Commission, which is
largely free from political interference. The Commission undertakes regular on- and offsite inspections and has the prerogative to put a bank under temporary administration
(ultimate decision power is with the government) or close monitoring. This prerogative
has been used actively; at present, two banks are under temporary administration.

Other financial institutions
•

The microfinance sector has expanded rapidly in the last decade. It complements the
banking sector, especially in deposit collection, as the distribution of bank branches is
highly limited, and there are minimum balances for opening bank deposits. Deposits
collected increased from the equivalent of 3 percent of bank deposits in 1993 (0.7
percent of GDP) to 9 percent (1.8 percent of GDP) in 2003. During the same period,
microfinance credits increased from the equivalent of 5.5 percent of total bank credits
(0.3 percent of GDP) to 22 percent (3.3 percent of GDP). Both government authorities
and the BCEAO are involved in the supervision of microfinance institutions.

•

The insurance sector has also expanded rapidly since the mid-1990s but is still not well
developed; while total insurance premia collected tripled from 1995 to 2002, they still
represent less than 1 percent of GDP. Foreigners hold majority shares of two and
minority shares of another two companies out of a total of eight. The insurance market is
concentrated; the three largest companies represent about two-thirds of the market. The
supervision responsibility lies with a regional body.

- 47 -

•

APPENDIX I

The pension system consists of two institutions. The Benin National Pension Fund
(FNRB), which provides services to public sector employees, is a pay-as-you-go system.
It has experienced repeated deficits (about 0.5 percent of GDP in 2003). Benin Social
Security Office (OBSS), which provides services to private sector employees, is a
funded system with financial resources equivalent to 2 percent of GDP and annual
benefit payments of about 0.3 percent of GDP. Three quarters of OBSS’s financial
resources are invested in bank accounts (term deposits), and the rest in securities.

Developmental issues
•

Low financial intermediation: Benin’s financial deepening indicators remain low, as in
other WAEMU countries (the ratio of broad money to GDP averaged 29 percent in
2000-2003). The weak performance of the judicial system and legal enforcement, and
the weak land registry system hamper the development of financial intermediation.

•

Diversification of the financial sector: The development of the microfinance sector and
the establishment in 2004 of a housing bank are contributing to the diversification of the
financial sector.22 However, the underdeveloped state of the securities markets, both at
the national and the regional level, hampers provision of term finance to private
enterprises, and makes the domestic placement of funds collected by the insurance sector
and the pension system difficult. It also constrains the development of the interbank
market.

•

Soundness of the banking sector: Most banks do not comply with the risk
concentration norms systematically because of their high exposure to the cotton sector.
This is likely to remain until the diversification of the economy is achieved. In addition,
two banks under temporary administration do not comply with the capital adequacy
ratio. The authorities are of the opinion that with the recent introduction of two new
banks, the concentration in the banking sector will diminish in the medium run.

22

The government will have a minority share of 10 percent in the housing bank. The budget
for 2004 includes a provision of CFAF 1 billion (0.2 percent of total government
expenditure) to that effect.

VIII. Safeguards Assessments:
The Central Bank of West African States (BCEAO) is the common central bank of the
West African states, which includes Benin. An on-site safeguards assessment of the
BCEAO completed on July 25, 2001 proposed specific remedies to alleviate
vulnerabilities that were identified by the staff. The following specific understandings
were subsequently reached regarding the key remedies:
•

Financial reporting framework. The Fund staff recommended that the BCEAO
formally adopt international accounting standards (IAS) and publish a complete set of
financial statements, including detailed explanatory notes. It was agreed between the
BCEAO and Fund staff that the BCEAO would strive to improve its financial and
accounting reporting by aligning its practices with those recommended by IAS, as
adopted internationally by other central banks.

•

Internal controls system. The staff noted that the absence of oversight of the bank’s
governance, financial reporting, and internal control practices by an entity external to
the management of the BCEAO represented a significant risk. It was agreed between
the BCEAO and Fund staff that, after seeking the opinion of the external auditor
(Commissaire Contrôleur), the BCEAO staff would propose to their Board of
Directors that it adopt a resolution whereby the external auditor would be required to
apprise the Board of Directors, during its annual review and approval of the financial
statements, of the state and quality of internal controls within the bank.

- 50 -

APPENDIX II

Based on the 2002 financial statements, the staff noted that the BCEAO had improved the
explanatory notes to the financial statements, and further changes were scheduled for the
next fiscal year, with a view toward a graduate alignment with IAS accounting, to the
extent applicable to central banks, by 2005. The external auditor apprised the Board of
Directors of the BCEAO of the quality of internal controls in June 2003, and the financial
statements for the year 2002 were published on the bank's website. The staff will continue
to follow up on the progress of the BCEAO in implementing the proposed
recommendations as part of the ongoing safeguards monitoring process.
IX.

Exchange Arrangement:

Benin is a member of the West African Economic and Monetary Union (WAEMU). The
exchange system common to all member countries of the WAMU is free of restrictions on
payments and transfers for current international transactions. The union’s common currency,
the CFA franc, was pegged to the French franc at the rate of CFAF 1 = F 0.02 until
January 12, 1994 when the CFA franc was devalued to CFAF 1 = F 0.01. Effective January
1, 1999, the CFA franc was pegged to the euro at a rate of EUR 1 = CFAF 655.957. As of
June 30, 2004, the rate of the CFA franc in terms of the SDR was SDR 1= CFAF 790.01.
X.

Article IV Consultations:

The 2002 Article IV consultation discussions were held in Cotonou during March 11-22.
The Executive Board discussed the staff report (Country Report 02/158) and concluded the
consultation on July 15, 2002.
XI.

ROSC Assessment:

An FAD mission conducted the fiscal module of a Report on Observance of Standards and
Codes (ROSC) in May 2001. The mission recommended the adoption of a three-year action
plan containing measures to improve expenditure management. The mission also identified a
list of actions to be urgently taken to ensure that the authorities were able to monitor budget
execution. The ROSC fiscal transparency module for Benin was circulated to the Board on
June 6, 2002 (Country Report 02/217).

APPENDIX III

Benin: Relations with the World Bank Group
Partnership in Benin’s development strategy
1.
Benin’s poverty reduction strategy paper (PRSP), finalized in December 2002, was
discussed at the Bank and Fund Boards in March 2003. The PRSP provides a framework for
aligning donor assistance programs, including those of the Bank and the Fund, with the
country’s poverty reduction efforts.
2.
The IMF has taken the lead in helping Benin maintain macroeconomic stability. In
that context, the three-year Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility (PRGF) arrangement,
which was approved in July 2000 and expired in March 2004, addressed issues related to
fiscal consolidation and structural reforms that are key to maintaining macroeconomic
stability and fostering growth. The PRGF’s structural conditionality focused on the following
areas: public expenditure management, tax administration, civil service reform, and the
privatization program.
3.
Public expenditure management reform has been an important focus of the Bank’s
assistance program. In close collaboration with the Fund and other donors, the Bank has
provided technical and financial assistance to the government’s reform efforts in this area.
The Bank has also been in the lead in helping Benin strengthen the provision of basic social
services, most importantly in the education and health sectors, pursuing a divestiture program
in the utility and infrastructure sectors, and enhancing the competitiveness of the cotton
sector.
IMF-World Bank collaboration in specific areas
4.
Common objectives and joint support for Benin’s PRSP and the Initiative for Heavily
Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC Initiative) processes have increased collaboration between
the Fund and Bank in recent years. The Bank and Fund teams are closely coordinating their
policy advice to the authorities. There is also close coordination in the determination of
structural conditionality. However, the Bank’s strategic shift toward programmatic lending,
as outlined in the 2003 Country Assistance Strategy (CAS), has an important effect on the
Bank’s approach toward conditionality: the Bank is increasingly moving toward an ex post
assessment of progress and is modulating its financial support to the pace of reform
implementation.
5.
In general, the Bank is leading the policy dialogue on key structural aspects of the
reform program, with a strong focus on public expenditure management. The Fund is in the
lead in the policy dialogue on macroeconomic issues, particularly fiscal elements of the
reform. As described below, there are several areas in Benin’s reform program in which the
Bank and Fund are sharing the lead in supporting the authorities, and others in which one or
the other institution is in the lead.

- 54 -

APPENDIX III

Areas in which the Bank leads
6.
Divestiture program and private sector development. The Bank has supported
Benin’s program for the divestiture of public enterprises through the Private Sector
Development Project and through the now-closed Transport Sector Project. The remaining
enterprises to be privatized include the cotton parastatal, SONAPRA, and most public
utilities: the telecommunications company (OPT), the water and electricity distribution
company (SBEE), and the Autonomous Port of Cotonou (PAC). Assistance for the
privatization of the OPT is provided through the Private Sector Development Project. The
Bank supports the privatization of the electricity branch of the SBEE through the Energy
Services Delivery Project which was approved by the Bank’s Board on July 6, 2004.
Successful completion of this privatization is a condition for moving to the second phase of
this project. The privatization of SONAPRA’s ginning mills is supported by the cotton sector
project. The Transportation Sector Project assisted the government in designing a strategy to
involve the private sector in the management of the PAC. The Fund is involved in policy
dialogue on these operations, given the importance of the divestiture program to
macroeconomic stability and growth.
7.
Social sector reforms. Improving access to basic social services is one of the four
main strategic pillars of Benin’s PRSP, and the health and basic education sectors are among
the priority sectors that have received increased budget allocations in the medium term
expenditure framework (MTEF). The Bank supported reform programs in these sectors
through investment projects that were closed in the past three years. In line with the CAS
discussed at the Bank’s Board on July 3, 2003, the Bank is continuing to work closely with
the government on enhancing access to, and quality of, education and health care services
through policy dialogue and financial and technical assistance in the context of the Poverty
Reduction Support Credits (PRSCs). A number of key policy measures in these two sectors
have been implemented as conditions for reaching in March 2003 the enhanced HIPC
Initiative completion point, and the First PRSC which was presented to the Bank’s Board in
March 2004. The Bank is also playing a lead role in support of a multisector response to the
HIV/AIDS pandemic, based on the government’s comprehensive strategic framework
covering 2000-05, adopted in December 2000. A Bank HIV/AIDS project was approved in
January 2002.
8.
Poverty monitoring. The PRSP presents an action plan to establish a reliable
database for measuring income poverty in 2003 using a revised methodology. The Bank is
providing technical support for the implementation of this action plan and for other efforts
aimed at understanding the determinants of poverty in Benin, such as the poverty and social
impact analysis (PSIA) of cotton sector reform, which is being prepared by IDA in
collaboration with the government, and the Poverty Assessment (PA), which was released in
June 2004.
9.
The PSIA will be completed in the second half of 2004, and the Poverty Assessment
will be disseminated in conjunction with the PRSP and with the assistance of the Bank by
end-2004. The Bank is also advising the authorities, in the context of the implementation of

- 55 -

APPENDIX III

the PRSP, on strengthening institutional arrangements for monitoring and evaluating poverty
in the country.
10.
Cotton sector reforms. Cotton is Benin’s only major cash crop, and the sector has
accounted in recent years for around 80 percent of its export earnings. The cotton sector is a
key focus of the Bank’s assistance program. A comprehensive reform of this sector, aimed at
liberalizing and strengthening the capacity of producers has been undertaken since the early
1990s, with the support of the Bank and bilateral donors. Important progress has been
achieved so far, such as by eliminating the monopsony of the state enterprise (SONAPRA) in
cotton marketing, liberalizing input supply, and opening the sector to private ginners. In
2002, the Bank Board approved a Cotton Sector Reform Project, which is supporting the
consolidation of the reforms. These include the recently launched process for privatization of
the SONAPRA as well as the strengthening of the capacities of producers’ associations and
the new private institutions managing the sector. The Bank is also helping the government to
define the regulatory framework for the sector which would be put in place by end-October
2004, before the start of the 2004/05 cotton marketing season. As Benin’s PRSP indicates,
there has been an apparent increase in rural poverty, including in cotton-producing areas, in
spite of sustained economic growth in the past years.
Areas in which the Bank and Fund share the lead
11.
Public expenditure management reform. Through its Public Expenditure Reform
Adjustment Credit (PERAC) and related Supplemental Credit (now both closed), the Bank
played a lead role in assisting the authorities in putting in place a framework for a thorough
public expenditure management reform, which was launched in 2001. The PERAC aimed at
enhancing the effectiveness and poverty focus of public expenditure, with the following
specific objectives: (i) the delegation of spending authority from the Ministries of Finance
and Planning to line ministries; and (ii) a move toward performance-based budgeting through
well-defined program budgets formulated within an MTEF in line with PRSP priorities. The
PERAC supported a set of institutional reforms and capacity-building measures essential to
reach these objectives. The reform has achieved good progress so far, such as the finalization
of an MTEF on the basis of the PRSP, the completion of a performance-based budget cycle,
an effective delegation of spending authority to line ministries, and an introduction of a
computerized budget implementation system, as well as in the area of reporting on and
auditing government accounts. The Fund supported these reform efforts through a number of
financial and structural benchmarks in the PRGF management.
12.
Fiscal policy and fiduciary framework. Fiscal consolidation was a key objective of
the Fund-supported PRGF arrangement. The Bank is focusing on inter- and intrasector
allocations, in particular in the priority sectors covered by the PERAC and the future PRSCs
(education, health, water and sanitation, transportation, agriculture, forestry and
environment). These priority sectors have represented about 55 percent of total expenditure,
excluding debt service, in recent years. In addition, the Bank is helping to strengthen Benin’s
fiduciary framework through analytical and advisory activities (AAA), such as forthcoming
update of the Country Procurement Assessment Report (CPAR), the Country Financial

- 56 -

APPENDIX III

Accountability Assessment (CFAA), and the governance and anti-corruption survey. The
PRSC-1 supports a comprehensive action plan for public procurement reform that addresses
main weaknesses identified in the 1999 CPAR.
13.
Poverty reduction strategy. Together with other external development partners, the
Bank and Fund have jointly provided assistance to the government in the preparation of
Benin’s PRSP. The PRSP was discussed at Bank and Fund Boards in March 2003, together
with a joint staff assessment prepared by Bank and Fund staffs. Both institutions will
continue to jointly advise the authorities on the refinement, implementation, monitoring, and
evaluation of the strategy. Bank and Fund staffs will also help the government finalize its
first annual progress report of the poverty reduction strategy by November 2004. The Bank
supported the government to prepare a detailed action plan for the dissemination of the
PRSP. The consultation program is designed to reach key line ministries within the
government, the National Assembly as well as the civil society and the private sector
14.
Debt sustainability. The Bank and the Fund jointly supported the government’s
efforts to reach the HIPC Initiative completion point in March 2003. In this context, Bank
and Fund staffs updated the debt sustainability analysis for Benin, in close collaboration with
the authorities. To maintain debt sustainability after enhanced HIPC Initiative relief, the
authorities will need to pursue a prudent external financing policy. The Bank and Fund
intend to continue the dialogue with the government on this issue, including through
providing advice on the required strengthening of domestic capacities for debt management.
15.
Civil service reform and devolution policy. The Bank provided in the past major
technical assistance for the design of the reform of the civil service promotion and
compensation system. Through its Enhanced Structural Adjustment Facility (ESAF) and
subsequent PRGF, the Fund has included structural measures designed to implement this
reform. However, a key measure─the adoption of legislation regarding the new
compensation system for civil servants─has been stalled for several years. Another important
area of public sector reform is the devolution policy, which gained momentum following the
municipal elections held in December 2002. The Fund is monitoring closely the fiscal
implications of this policy. The Bank has recently conducted two pieces of analytical work
on public administration reform and decentralization as a basis for policy dialogue.
16.
Financial sector policy. The Fund has supported the government’s efforts to
strengthen Benin’s financial sector. These efforts have focused on ensuring that banks meet
the Regional Banking Commission’s prudential ratios. The reform of the financial sector also
includes the divestiture of the state-owned Continental Bank and the rehabilitation of
microfinance institutions. As part of the Private Sector Development Project, the Bank has
been providing support to two major microfinance institutions. A financial sector review was
completed and the report was released in July 2004.

APPENDIX III

Areas in which the Fund leads
17.
Macroeconomic stability. The medium-term objective of Benin’s macroeconomic
program is to achieve strong economic growth and reduce poverty, while maintaining
financial stability. The Fund has been supporting this program through its dialogue on
macroeconomic policy, technical assistance, and, until March 2004, the PRGF framework.
18.
Tax and custom administration reforms. To enhance Benin’s fiscal revenues, the
Fund has provided technical assistance to help the authorities prepare and update action plans
aimed at improving the performance of the tax and customs administrations as well as
broadening the tax base.
World Bank strategy
19.
The Bank prepared a new Country Assistance Strategy (CAS), which was discussed
at its Board on July 3, 2003. The overriding objective of the Bank’s assistance in the years
ahead is to help Benin reverse the recent trends of limited or no poverty reduction amid
relatively robust growth. Progress in reducing poverty and attaining the Millennium
Development Goals (MDGs) requires further deepening of cotton sector reforms,
strengthening efforts toward diversifying the economy, making tangible progress in the social
sectors, building effective and responsive public institutions, promoting gender equality, and
strengthening collaboration with the private sector and civil society. The CAS describes a
focused program of financial assistance and nonlending services as the Bank’s contribution
to addressing these challenges. It supports the implementation and further refinement of the
PRSP, and it is aligned to the four PRSP pillars.23
20.
The CAS enforces the gradual shift of the Bank’s lending program toward
programmatic lending, as initiated under the interim CAS (I-CAS) approved in January 2001
and in response to the PRSP’s explicit invitation to donors to do more in that area. Building
on the PERAC, the Bank expects this shift to enhance the development impact of its
assistance to Benin by fostering national leadership of development programs. It should also
facilitate and enhance donor coordination around Benin’s PRSP. This will require, however,
a continued strong commitment to advance public sector management reforms aimed at
increasing efficiency in the use of public resources. To address these transitional challenges,
23

The four pillars to effective poverty reduction are the following: (i) the strengthening of
the medium-term macroeconomic framework; (ii) human development and environmental
management, including improving the access of the poor to quality basic services (basic
education, primary health care, water and sanitation, food security and nutrition, adequate
habitat, and rural roads); (iii) improvement of governance and institutional reforms, such as
decentralization, public administration reform, and strengthening of the legal and judicial
system; and (iv) improvement of employment or income-generating opportunities for the
poor, and the strengthening of their capacity to participate in decision making and
production.

- 58 -

APPENDIX III

the Bank will continue its support of Benin’s public expenditure reform through financial and
technical support. Annual single-tranche PRSCs are envisaged to become a key vehicle for
Bank support to the country. A first PRSC was presented to the Bank’s Board in March 2004,
and the appraisal of the second PRSC is scheduled for September 2004.
21.
The PRSP preparation process has fostered collaboration between the Bank and other
development partners, including civil society organizations. Donors have signaled their
willingness to align their assistance programs to the PRSP and some of them (the European
Union, the African Development Bank, Switzerland, Denmark, and the Netherlands) are
preparing budget support operations, in close coordination with the Bank’s PRSC preparation
process.

As of July 13, 2003, the Bank lending portfolio consisted of six operations, with a net
commitment of US$121.9 million and an undisbursed balance of US$64.2 million (see table
above). The CAS has a determined lending volume for the period FY04 - FY06 amounting to
US$200 million. As discussed previously, a large part of IDA financing (US$85 million) will
be channeled through PRSCs. As indicated in the CAS, a key objective of the Bank’s
nonlending program is to help the government strengthen its sector-wide expenditure
programs as a basis for consolidating programmatic support and building the capacity
required for preparing, implementing, and monitoring these programs.

APPENDIX IV

Benin: Statistical Issues
(As of end-June, 2004)
1.
Core statistical indicators are generally provided to the Fund on a timely basis (see
attached table). However, there are weaknesses in the areas of national accounts, public
finance, monetary statistics, and balance of payments. In January 2001, the authorities
adopted the General Data Dissemination System (GDDS) as the framework for the
development of Benin’s national statistical system; sectoral metadata, which were initially
posted on the Fund’s Dissemination Standards Bulletin Board in September 2001, are due to
be updated. As a follow-up to GDDS participation, STA technical assistance (funded by the
Japanese government) is being offered to the eight member countries of the West African
Economic and Monetary Union (WAEMU) to assist them in implementing plans for the
improvement of their statistical systems. A Fund regional statistical advisor initiated a
program of assistance in government finance statistics, which is now managed by the West
Africa Regional Technical Assistance Center (AFRITAC West). A real sector statistics
improvement program, conducted in collaboration with the regional statistical office
AFRISTAT and initiated in May 2002, is currently being implemented.
Real sector
2.
Beninese national statistics agencies were represented at two GDDS seminars, one in
Yaoundé in October 1998 and another in Bamako in April 2001. As a follow-up to the
GDDS workshop in Bamako, significant initiatives have been taken in order to upgrade
Benin’s national income accounting system, which is based on 1968 System of National
Accounts (SNA 1968). Benin also participates in WAEMU’s harmonization of statistical
methodologies through the multilateral surveillance process, currently seeking regional
improvements in the area of national accounts. In 2003, the National Statistics Institute
(INSAE) undertook the necessary steps to change the base year for the accounting of the
agricultural output and to include the amortization in the public administration accounts.
Under the GDDS project for the AFRITAC West countries, a statistical register and an
industrial production index are being developed, and a series of missions are scheduled for
the 1993 SNA implementation.
3.
Starting with January 1998, Benin has been producing the WAEMU harmonized
consumer price index (CPI), in compliance with WAEMU standards.
Public finances
4.
Monthly government finance statistics are compiled by the Ministry of Finance with a
one- to three-month lag, based on information provided by the budget, customs, tax, and
treasury directorates. The Ministry of Finance prepares a monthly reconciliation of spending
commitments made by the budget directorate and payments made by the treasury. However,
no final budget or treasury accounts are published at the end of the fiscal year. Benin
currently does not report public finance data for publication in International Financial
Statistics (IFS) or the Government Finance Statistics Yearbook (GFSY).

- 60 -

APPENDIX IV

Monetary statistics
5.
Benin’s monetary statistics are compiled and disseminated by the regional Central
Bank of West African States (BCEAO). The BCEAO has experienced difficulties in
estimating currency in circulation for the individual member countries, partly because of
delays in processing cash in its vaults. Currency notes held in the vault are subtracted from
currency in circulation, even though the former contains a large proportion of notes from
other WAEMU countries. Difficulties in the sorting out of currency notes have persisted. The
BCEAO intends to resolve the issue by end-2004.
6.
A monetary and financial statistics mission visited the BCEAO headquarters in Dakar
in May 2001, and STA participated in a BCEAO-sponsored seminar on monetary statistics in
April 2003. In these regional forums, STA reviewed with the BCEAO representatives
outstanding methodological issues that concern the member countries of WAEMU and
discussed the BCEAO’s plans to adopt the Monetary and Financial Statistics Manual.
Balance of payments
7.
Since December 1998, the responsibility for compiling and disseminating balance of
payments statistics has been formally assigned to the BCEAO by area-wide legislation
adopted by the countries participating in WAEMU. The national agency of the BCEAO in
Cotonou is responsible for compiling and disseminating Benin’s balance of payments
statistics, and the BCEAO headquarters in Dakar for delineating the methodology and
calculating the international reserves managed on behalf of the participating countries.
8.
Data consistency has significantly improved over the past few years, with a full
transition to the Balance of Payments Manual, Fifth Edition (BPM5). This was supported by
technical assistance provided by STA (statistical advisor posted at the BCEAO headquarters
in Dakar from July 1996 through July 1999), which contributed to the improved reporting of
yearly balance of payments data in the framework of the BPM5 for the period 1996-2001.
With the backward revision of data to 1988, a consistent series was created. The BCEAO
national agency disseminates balance of payments statistics with a seven-month lag,
exceeding GDDS guidelines. The BCEAO also compiles and disseminates the annual data of
the international investment position data with an 18-month lag.
9.
Regarding trade data, the ASYCUDA24 customs computer system was upgraded in
1999, and its installation in all main border customs houses is being completed; this should
allow for a better monitoring of import data and improve the coverage of informal trade,
especially with Nigeria.
24

The ASYCUDA (or SYDONIA, in French) software, sponsored by the United Nations
Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) and by donor countries, has already been
implemented in many countries. Freely available to customs administration, it is provided
together with appropriate staff-training schemes.

- 61 -

APPENDIX IV

10.
Further improvement in the data for services and transfers (especially workers’
remittances) will depend on the intensification of the contacts with reporting bodies. The
authorities’ commitment to strengthen the human and technical resources should be
enhanced.
11.
Concerning the financial account, the foreign assets of the private nonbanking sector
are still not well covered, especially the assets of WAEMU residents, which are obtained
through partial surveys of residents’ foreign assets. The organization of an annual, exhaustive
survey for the reporting of foreign direct investment transactions in Benin is still at a very
preliminary stage. The BCEAO has recently implemented a compilation system allowing
commercial banks to report data on payments involving nonresidents, however these data are
not used to produce annual balance of payments estimates, but rather to assess existing
information.
Poverty data
12.
As explained in the joint staff assessment Country Report 03/111 of the poverty
reduction strategy paper (PRSP), major methodological weaknesses remain regarding
poverty data. In particular, the methodology used in the household surveys raises concerns
about the treatment of the nonfood expenditure share in the calculation of the poverty line,
the division of Benin into 12 agro-ecological zones, and the comparability of poverty
statistics across urban and rural areas and across time. The authorities are implementing an
action plan to address these methodological issues.
External debt
13.
The Caisse Autonome d'Amortissements (CAA) is responsible for signing
international loan agreements, maintaining the debt database, and servicing the government's
external debt obligations. Since 1995, the CAA has been using the Commonwealth
Secretariat Debt Recording and Management System (CS-DRMS) to record and manage the
debt. For the majority of creditors, the CAA's database is fairly comprehensive and up-todate, and contains accurate stock data, as well as projected debt-service flows, on a loan-byloan basis. For a small number of creditors, however, regular statements are not received.

Statement by the IMF Staff Representative
October 6, 2004
This statement provides information that has become available since the staff report was
issued. The new information does not alter the thrust of the staff appraisal.
1.
Fiscal data at end-June 2004 indicate that the fiscal situation is broadly on track
(Table 1). All indicative targets for end-June 2004 were met, with the exception of the target
for the wage bill, which was slightly exceeded (by 2 percent). In particular, both revenue and
poverty-reducing outlays were higher than projected at the time of the consultation mission.
2.
Reflecting the general weakness in economic activity and the tightening of
monetary policy, credit growth slowed down during the first five months of 2004. At
end-May 2004, credit to the nongovernment sector had increased by 12 percent on a
12-month basis, compared to 33 percent at end-2003. In parallel, the ratio of non performing
loans of commercial banks increased from 5 percent at end-2003 to 6 percent at end-May
2004. Inflation remained low, with the consumer price index increasing by 1.1 percent in the
twelve-month period ending July 2004.
3.
The authorities have started implementing budgetary cuts as planned (CFAF 30
billion, equivalent to 1.4 percent of GDP) to compensate for the shortfall in revenue
(with respect to budgeted levels), and thus limit this year’s fiscal deficit to 5½ percent of
GDP. Internal government discussions on the identification of the budget cuts were
concluded in August. Budgetary allocations for domestically financed capital expenditure
were reduced by CFAF 27.6 billion and for current spending by CFAF 2.4 billion.
4.
The privatization process of the four ginning mills of SONAPRA has reached its
final stage. The government has recently accepted the highest offers received for three mills
through a competitive bidding process; the transfer of these mills to the qualified bidders is
envisaged to be completed by end-October 2004. Regarding the fourth ginning mill, some
delays have been incurred because the highest bidder was unable to provide sufficient
financing guarantees; however, the authorities are confident that the sale of the mill could be
completed in the coming weeks.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
November 12, 2004

International Monetary Fund
700 19th Street, NW
Washington, D. C. 20431 USA

IMF Concludes 2004 Article IV Consultation with Benin
On October 6 2004, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded
the Article IV consultation with Benin.1
Background
Benin’s economic performance over the period 2001-03 was strong. Real GDP growth
averaged 5.3 percent, driven by growth in the cotton and services sectors. Inflation was low,
averaging 2.6 percent per year. The external current deficit, which increased in 2002 owing to
the unexpected drop in the world price of cotton, narrowed in 2003 as terms of trade improved.
The real effective exchange rate, however, appreciated about 4 percent on average per year
since end-2000, owing mainly to the decline of the U.S. dollar against the euro, to which the
CFA franc is pegged.
Overall fiscal performance over the period was satisfactory. Revenue collection strengthened,
mostly reflecting improvement in tax administration, although weaknesses in customs
administration remained. Expenditures were kept in check; however, spending for health and
education, as well as government investment, remained broadly below targets. Efforts were
made to strengthen public expenditure management, particularly by putting in place an
integrated computerized expenditure management system and a mechanism for tracking
poverty-reducing expenditure.
A prudent monetary policy, conducted at the regional level by the Central Bank for West
African States (BCEAO), helped maintain confidence in the currency and keep inflation low
during the period. Following a strong expansion during 1998-2001, broad money contracted in
2002 and remained stable in 2003, largely reflecting developments in the balance of
payments. In response to the rapid expansion of bank credit to the private sector in 2002-03,

1

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On
return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the
Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the
Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the
country's authorities.

-2the BCEAO increased the reserve requirement in February 2004 from 9 to 13 percent. The
financial health of the banking sector has continued to be sound.
Progress in the structural area was mixed. The liberalization of the cotton sector was pursued,
mainly by undertaking the privatization of the cotton parastatal, SONAPRA, and assisting
sector stakeholders establish an autonomous agency (CSPR) for managing the
commercialization of seed cotton and settling input credit. However, the privatization of
SONAPRA incurred delays and was not completed by mid-June 2004 as scheduled.
Furthermore, the CSPR experienced cash flow problems, stemming from the sales of inputs
conducted outside the legal framework established under the reform of the sector. Progress in
other areas was also slow. In particular, the implementation of the divestiture program of public
utilities and the Port of Cotonou did not progress significantly, and the civil service reform
stalled due to strong opposition from trade unions and the parliament.
Benin’s sound macroeconomic policies over the period helped it reach the completion point
under the enhanced HIPC Initiative in March 2003. Debt relief obtained under the initiative was
critical in reducing the debt-to-export ratio to 157.5 percent at the completion point; the debt
ratio is expected to decline further to below the threshold of 150 percent from 2005 onward.
Sustained economic growth over the last ten years allowed Benin’s per capita income to rise
and most social indicators to improve steadily. However, as indicated in the poverty reduction
strategy paper (PRSP) completed by the authorities in December 2002, these achievements
did not translate into significant progress in poverty reduction. Against this background, the
PRSP presents the authorities’ objectives and priority measures for consolidating
macroeconomic stability, reducing poverty, and making progress towards reaching the
Millennium Development Goals (MDGs).
Macroeconomic performance since the beginning of 2004 has suffered from a poor cotton crop
and the tightening of import restrictions by Nigeria. In the circumstances, the target for
economic growth this year has been reduced from 6 percent in the original PRSP to 3 percent.
The external current account deficit is expected to widen by ½ percentage points of GDP,
owing mostly to lower-than-expected export of cotton and re export to Nigeria. To compensate
for the shortfall in government revenue arising from weaker-than-envisaged activity in 2004,
the authorities decided to strengthen tax and customs administrations and cut total
expenditure by 1.4 percent of GDP, while protecting priority spending to the extent possible.
As part of the Article IV consultation, an assessment of the Fund’s longer-term program
engagement in Benin was prepared by the staff and discussed with the authorities.2
The assessment concludes that, since 1993, Benin has made major progress in
macroeconomic stabilization. It highlights that the diversification of the economy from cotton
production has remained elusive. It underscores the need for Benin to increase the share of
poverty-reducing expenditures in government spending, to accelerate structural reforms to
raise productivity and improve service delivery, and to strengthen the judiciary system.
2

Such assessments are required for members with longer-term program engagement. Benin
has had arrangements with the Fund almost continuously since 1989, including a Structural
Adjustment Facility arrangement (1989-92), two Enhanced Structural Adjustment Facility
arrangements (1993-96 and 1996-99), and a Poverty Reduction Growth Facility arrangement
(2000-03).

-3Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors commended Benin’s considerable progress toward macroeconomic
stabilization over the past decade, which has helped sustain robust economic growth and
placed Benin among the better-performing countries of the West African Economic and
Monetary Union. Directors noted that Benin’s strong economic growth and low inflation during
2001-03 continued to be underpinned by a broadly appropriate stance of macroeconomic
policies. Directors stressed, however, that greater efforts are needed to reverse the decline in
Benin’s external competitiveness and to lower the economy’s vulnerability to external shocks.
In this connection, they called for more determined implementation of structural reforms,
especially with respect to the cotton sector, privatization and private sector development, the
civil service, and governance.
Directors noted that economic performance in 2004 has been adversely affected by a poor
cotton crop and an intensification of import restrictions from a major trading partner, which has
contributed to a revenue shortfall. They commended the planned introduction of revenue and
expenditure measures aimed at limiting the deterioration of the fiscal position, while
emphasizing that further measures may be necessary if weaknesses in revenue collection
were to continue. Directors also encouraged the authorities to push ahead with their plans to
strengthen the institutions in charge of seed cotton and input commercialization, and to pursue
discussions with Nigeria to resolve outstanding trade issues.
Directors endorsed the authorities’ revised medium-term macroeconomic targets, which they
found to be in line with the PRSP’s overall objective of raising economic growth in order to
reduce poverty and achieve the Millennium Development Goals. They stressed that
achievement of this objective will require an acceleration of structural reforms and the
continuation of prudent macroeconomic policies. Directors commended the authorities’ efforts
to strengthen the PRSP, and encouraged rapid completion of the first annual progress report
on the implementation of the poverty reduction strategy. Directors welcomed the regular policy
dialogue that the authorities have initiated with the donor community, which is an important
step toward increased donor harmonization. While calling for the continued involvement of the
donor community in Benin’s development effort—including through the provision of appropriate
technical assistance—Directors emphasized that the authorities need to address the weak
implementation capacity that hampers the execution of social expenditures and undermines
the potential benefits that could accrue to Benin from higher aid inflows.
Directors called for continued efforts in the medium term to boost revenue collection and
increase the level and quality of poverty-reducing spending, while curbing nonpriority
expenditure. In this regard, they urged the authorities to step up the implementation of the
action plans to improve tax and customs administrations. They also underscored the need to
ensure that budgetary allocations reflect PRSP priorities, to refrain from granting further wage
increases before the introduction of a new compensation system, and to limit wasteful
spending on public utilities. Directors stressed that public expenditure management should be
strengthened so as to improve the monitoring of budget execution, streamline budget
procedures, and enhance transparency and the tracking of poverty-reducing outlays. Directors
encouraged the authorities to continue and deepen the decentralization process, while
ensuring that it does not weaken central government accounts and that expenditure
management at the local level is strengthened.

-4Directors emphasized the importance of accelerating structural reforms to make the economy
more competitive and improve the delivery of services to the population. They urged the
authorities to establish a credible agenda for the divestiture of public utilities, to adopt and
implement a new administrative and civil service management reform, and to rapidly involve
the private sector in the management of the Port of Cotonou. They also encouraged the
authorities to start preparing the next steps of the cotton sector reform to ensure a transparent
and successful transition to a fully competitive system. Directors also stressed the need to
improve the business environment through determined implementation of the strategy to fight
corruption, the strengthening of the judiciary system, and the enhancement of governance and
transparency at the customs department. They emphasized that these reforms are essential to
improve Benin’s competitiveness in the context of the fixed exchange rate.
Directors noted Benin’s high dependence on cotton exports and on trade with Nigeria, and
encouraged the authorities to intensify their efforts to promote export diversification while
maintaining a liberal trade and exchange system. At the same time, it was noted that Benin’s
poverty reduction efforts would benefit greatly from increased access to industrial countries’
markets. Directors welcomed the conclusion of the debt sustainability analysis that Benin’s
external debt remains sustainable, and urged the authorities to take the necessary action to
keep the external debt on a sustainable path, including by pursuing a prudent debtmanagement policy.
Directors welcomed Benin’s commitment to strengthening the financial sector.
They encouraged the continued efforts to ensure compliance with the regional banking
commission’s prudential ratios and to deepen financial intermediation, including through the
strengthening of the legal and judicial system and addressing land titling issues.
Directors also welcomed the authorities’ support for the rehabilitation of microfinance
institutions and their commitment to intensifying the supervision of this sector.
Directors welcomed the candid exchange of views between Fund staff and the authorities
regarding the ex post assessment (EPA) of Benin’s longer-term engagement with the Fund.
They concurred that the EPA provides useful lessons for future program design and
implementation.
Directors agreed that Benin’s prolonged use of Fund resources reflected the extensive and
complex nature of the reforms required to reinforce the foundations for sustained privatesector-led growth and poverty reduction. They considered that Fund-supported programs since
1993 had appropriately focused on economic and financial stabilization, and on structural
reforms essential to liberalize the economy and raise growth. Directors agreed that the Fund’s
involvement has helped the authorities build capacity, particularly in tax administration, and
mobilize concessional resources from the international community. They expressed concern,
however, that there has not been significant progress in poverty reduction. They also noted
that while initial efforts to liberalize the economy and reduce government intervention were
successful, further reforms, including the divestiture program for public utilities and the civil
service reform, incurred protracted delays.
Directors concurred that the main challenge for Benin is to achieve sustained higher growth
and reduce poverty, while preserving macroeconomic stability and reducing the economy’s
vulnerability to external shocks. They stressed that reaching these objectives will require
continuation of fiscal consolidation, while increasing the level and quality of poverty-reducing
outlays, and enhanced efforts to implement the reform agenda.

-5Directors agreed that a further PRGF arrangement with low access would help Benin to
continue to address the remaining challenges that lie ahead, including through securing the
necessary concessional financial support, and would provide a framework for a sound policy
response in case of external shocks. Directors stressed that the program supported by any
such arrangement should incorporate the lessons learnt from the EPA, should set out clear
objectives on the structural front, and should integrate the PRSP into a sound multi-year
macroeconomic framework. A broader aim would be for Benin eventually to exit from the use
of Fund resources.
Public Information Notices (PINs) form part of the IMF's efforts to promote transparency of the IMF's
views and analysis of economic developments and policies. With the consent of the country

Statement by Damian Ondo Mañe, Executive Director for Benin
October 6, 2004

I thank the staff for the well–balanced Staff Report and Ex Post Assessment of Performance
Under Fund-Supported Programs. I would also like to express the gratitude of my Beninese
authorities for the continuous financial and technical assistance they have received from the
Fund over the years. They fully appreciate the assessment made of their relations with the
Fund over the last decade, and the lessons they have drawn from it. They would like to state
that they have made in that time span considerable progress towards a market-based
economy and have reduced a large number of rigidities that had constrained the efficient
functioning of the economy. They would also like to state that more remains to be done to
improve the efficiency of the economy further in the period ahead. Therefore, they would
like to pursue their unfinished reform agenda through a new Fund-supported PRGF.
Developments during 2004
After registering a strong annual real GDP growth of about 5 percent in 2001-03, the
Beninese economy suffered a setback in 2004 owing to a sharp fall in cotton production and
to a restriction on her re-exports which have been subjected to an import restriction imposed
by a neighboring country. The restrictions had a further adverse effect of leading to halving
the projected GDP growth rate to 3 percent and to customs revenue being 17 percent lower
than planned for the first quarter of the year. This decision also led to a 20 percent decline in
port traffic in Cotonou (Benin) between January and April 2004 compared to the same period
in 2003. During the 2003/04 season, cotton production was 17 percent lower than anticipated
because of disruptions caused by some entities acting outside the main umbrella organization
in charge of safeguarding relations between input importers, distributors, farmers and
ginners. That umbrella organization represents the interests of all stakeholders and is in
charge of selling the farmers’ output, collecting payments from ginners, using part of the
proceeds to pay back input credit, and paying the remainder to the farmers. Its inability that
year to collect from some farmers while it was still responsible for paying back input credit
delayed the start of its normal season-related activities. The negative impact on output
arising from this delay was compounded by the low yields resulting from the low quality of
inputs purchased outside the regular system.
My Beninese authorities promptly implemented remedial actions to redress the weak
economic activities in 2004 and revised their policies to achieve their medium-term
objectives. In the event, they decided to raise the GDP growth rate gradually to 7 percent, a
level set under the PRSP, over the medium term. This would be achieved through a rebound
in cotton production, improved overall economic efficiency, and increase in investment
together with an acceleration of the pace of structural reforms. For the immediate future, the
authorities took strong fiscal actions to strengthen tax administration, cut total spending by
1.4 percent of GDP while protecting priority spending. In that connection, they adopted the
quarterly fiscal indicative targets for 2004 shown in Table 15 of the staff report, which they
have broadly adhered to. They expect these measures to be sufficiently strong to contain the

-2fiscal deficit to 5.5 percent of GDP and have it financed mainly with concessional borrowing
and with grants.
Monetary policy, carried out by the regional central bank, was cautious, and helped keep
inflation low. The central bank has succeeded in containing private sector credit through an
increase in reserve requirement. The financial sector in Benin continues to be relatively
sound, and my authorities have committed to improving compliance with prudential ratios,
fostering the supervision of micro-finance institutions and deepening financial
intermediation. The divestiture of the only bank left in the government portfolio could not be
completed, as the sale of minority shares was not attractive to investors. However, the
authorities are determined to re-launch the bidding soon, combining government shares with
those of the regional development bank.
The implementation of structural reforms has been invigorated in 2004 compared with the
past. In the cotton sector, the authorities are taking measures to avoid the recurrence of the
disturbances experienced in the 2003/04 season by strengthening the institutions in charge of
seed cotton and input commercialization with the advice of the World Bank. They intend to
prevent the reemergence of a parallel circuit for input provision and sale of cotton. They will
also put in place before the 2004/05 harvest season a regulatory framework defining the role
and responsibilities of the government and the shareholders, and replace the current system
of administrative allocation of seed cotton with a system based on competition among
ginners.
The divestiture of SONAPRA, which has been delayed in the past has gained momentum as
the privatization of its four ginning mills has reached its final stage. The Government has
recently accepted the highest offers received for three ginning mills through a competitive
bidding process. Their transfer to qualifying bidders is envisaged to be completed by endOctober 2004. Regarding the fourth ginning mill, some delays have been incurred because
the highest bidder was unable to provide sufficient financing guarantees. However, the
authorities expect to complete the sale of that mill in the coming weeks.
As for the port of Cotonou, the authorities are encouraging the unions to agree on a new
agenda for the involvement of the private sector in its management. The company supplying
water and electricity has recently been split, with different entities in charge of water and of
electricity. Likewise, the post office and telecommunications have become separate entities.
Civil service reform, by contrast, has been very difficult to manage because of the long and
difficult process of mustering consensus with unions and Parliament. Recently the
government suffered a setback as the Constitutional Court rejected the draft law establishing
a single statute for government employees covering both civil servants and contractuals,
which is considered a prerequisite for implementing the reform. With the assistance of the
World Bank, the authorities are preparing a new roadmap for civil service reform.
My Beninese authorities are mindful of the need to improve the business environment. To
this end, they want to implement the strategy to fight corruption adopted in 2002 and at the
same time strengthen the legal and judiciary system, with the support of the World Bank.

-3Furthermore, they plan to associate the private sector with a diagnostic study on the
impediments to private sector development. With World Bank technical assistance, they also
want to address the question of the lack of land titling, which limits access to credit.
The authorities’ medium term policy framework
As shown in Box 3 of the staff report, the improvement in Benin’s growth performance is
driven by a higher contribution from capital accumulation, and a positive contribution from
total factor productivity. This is the result of an improved environment for private sector
investors, an increase in public investment sustained by inflows of external assistance, and
progress in liberalizing the economy. Therefore, in order to achieve the PRSP growth rate of
at least 7 percent over the medium term, the authorities are aware that they will need to
further improve the business environment for domestic and external private sector investors,
and accelerate implementation of the structural reform agenda.
Fiscal policy has a major role to play in the medium term context. My authorities will
continue to combat tax evasion, collect tax arrears and simplify procedures in line with recent
Fund technical assistance recommendations to strengthen tax and customs administration.
They have just requested additional technical assistance to examine direct taxation policy and
the tax exemption system.
The authorities plan to frame their expenditure strategy over the medium term, in line with
PRSP priorities in budgetary allocations, while keeping total outlays stable in terms of GDP.
The World Bank is helping update the medium-term expenditure framework, and this will
serve as a vehicle for carrying out annual budgets, which will highlight priority povertyreducing expenditures. In that medium-term framework, the authorities intend to keep the
wage bill at 5 percent of GDP by containing wage increases, and to curb the growth in nonpriority spending. Also with the assistance of the World Bank, they are completing the
reform of public expenditure management in order to improve the monitoring of budget
execution, enhance transparency and enhance the tracking of poverty reduction public
outlays. My authorities have reiterated their resolve not to carry out the large infrastructure
projects (port and airport) under the five year Government Action Program (2001-2006)
without assessing their macroeconomic and financial impact, and without discussing the
results with the IMF and World Bank staffs. The financing of fiscal deficits will be provided
by donors as they see that the implementation of Benin’s PRSP continues to satisfy their
conditionality.
The poverty reduction strategy, according to Benin’s PRSP, will hinge on high quality
growth, reinforced macroeconomic stability, and transparent, efficient, and monitorable
public spending, as mentioned above. The acceleration of structural reforms is key to raising
productivity and improving public service delivery; encouraging private investment in order
to foster economic growth and diversification, in particular through improved governance
and judiciary system; and improving the level and quality of government outlays while
curbing non-priority expenditures. Shortcomings in the PRSP as identified in the joint staff
assessment (JSA) are being addressed. In parallel the authorities are assessing progress in
implementing the poverty reduction strategy presented in the PRSP and evaluating the

-4execution of poverty reducing outlays. As necessary, the targets and policies presented in the
PRSP will be revised and will be mentioned in the first annual progress report of
implementation of the PRSP scheduled for the end of this year.
My authorities have begun the difficult task of tackling the vulnerabilities of their
economy. To this end, they are promoting the diversification away from cotton into such
crops as cashew nuts, wood products, and staple agricultural products. This way, non-cotton
exports have increased from 16 percent of total exports in 1994-99 to 29 percent on average
during 2000-03. Nevertheless, they are aware that more needs to be done to reduce the
vulnerability of the economy to external shocks. Hence they count very much on further
Fund policy advice and that of specialized international institutions.
My authorities stress the destabilizing effects of market access and farm subsidy policies of
large industrial counties, which both hinder welfare in low-income countries and reduce their
chances of further diversification. It is for that reason that they have launched, with other
West African countries, the Sectoral Initiative on Cotton calling for the elimination of cotton
subsidies.
My authorities agree with the findings of the Ex Post Assessment. They also acknowledge
the mixed records in the implementation of structural reforms in the past, which is due to the
necessary but slow pace of building consensus over these issues so vital to the lives of the
people. However, they point to a newly found determination to press ahead with these
reforms as consensus-building takes hold. For these reasons, my authorities feel that the
reform agenda is far from being finished. They would therefore like to secure Fund financial
support for another PRGF with the expectation that the catalytic nature of Fund financing
will strengthen the hand of government reformers to pursue their policy agenda, and give the
right signal to the international community and markets to muster the necessary financing
and policy advice to push forward the remaining reforms. The representatives of the
international community present in Benin as well as the private sector share my authorities’
views.
