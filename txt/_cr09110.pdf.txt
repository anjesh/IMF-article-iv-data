EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
Vietnam has made commendable progress in stabilizing an overheating economy, but
continues to face considerable challenges. The near-term outlook remains difficult amid the
deteriorating global environment. Growth is likely to slow due to weaker domestic and external
demand. Risks are titled toward the downside, as exports, private remittances, and capital
inflows could decline further, worsening growth prospects and adding pressure on the external
position. Moreover, slower economic activity could heighten vulnerabilities in the banking
system. Despite these difficulties, the medium-term outlook is still favorable, with Vietnam
remaining an attractive destination for foreign investors.
Key Issues and Policy Discussions
The authorities’ policy objectives have shifted toward supporting growth. They
significantly eased fiscal and monetary policies in the final quarter of 2008 and recently
announced a broad economic stimulus plan. Given deteriorating growth prospects, an
accommodative fiscal stance in 2009 is appropriate. However, the scope for a fiscal stimulus
is limited in the absence of additional concessional external financing. Staff advised the
authorities to carefully balance growth and stability objectives and focus on measures that are
effective, well-targeted, and temporary, such as enhancing the social safety net and
accelerating existing high quality public investment projects. While inflation risks have
waned, any further easing of monetary conditions may have limited impact on growth.
Staff and the authorities broadly agreed on the desirability of moving toward greater
exchange rate flexibility. Despite the recent widening of the trading band and exchange rate
devaluation, the dong continues to face depreciation pressures. Exchange rate flexibility
should be increased further, supported by appropriate macroeconomic policies to maintain
confidence in the dong.
Addressing banking sector vulnerabilities is high priority. While recognizing the need to
further improve banking supervision, the authorities’ assessment of the banking sector
remains sanguine. Over the medium term, advancing financial sector reform will be crucial,
in particular strengthening the operational autonomy of the State Bank of Vietnam (SBV).
Broader structural reforms will help sustain growth and bolster investor confidence.
The main priority is to accelerate reforms that will enhance Vietnam’s competitiveness.
However, it will also be important to develop a long-term framework of revenue and
expenditure management that will preserve fiscal sustainability. In addition to ongoing tax
reforms, further efforts to broaden the tax base are needed. Spending should be reviewed to
increase efficiency in public investment and to ensure adequate protection for vulnerable
groups. Improving efficiency and governance of state-owned enterprises would also help
reduce fiscal risks.

I. INTRODUCTION
1.
Following an extended period of impressive economic performance, Vietnam is
facing considerable challenges. After overheating in 2007, the economic situation
deteriorated significantly in the first half of 2008. Rapid credit growth fueled by massive
capital inflows, combined with higher public sector spending and a surge in energy and food
prices, led to high inflation and large trade deficits. These developments weighed on investor
sentiment and put strong depreciation pressures on the dong. While the authorities have made
commendable progress in stabilizing the economy, Vietnam has begun to experience adverse
effects from the global financial turmoil and economic slowdown. These difficulties are
compounded by an already large current account deficit and low international reserves, along
with weaknesses in the banking and corporate sectors. Key challenges are designing and
implementing policies to ensure macroeconomic and financial stability amid the global
downturn, as well as pressing ahead with structural reforms to sustain growth and poverty
reduction over the medium term.
II. RECENT ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS

Economic activity has slowed. Real GDP growth declined from 8½ percent in 2007
to 6¼ percent in 2008—the slowest pace since 1999—driven by subdued activity in

Inflation increased to a 17-year
high, but has eased recently. Headline
inflation rose rapidly and peaked at
28¼ percent (y/y) in August 2008. It has
since moderated to 17½ percent (y/y) in
January 2009, turning negative on a
monthly basis in the last three months,
mainly due to lower food and energy
prices. Core inflation (excluding raw food
and energy) followed a similar pattern, but
the decline has been more gradual. High
inflation led to large wage hikes, but wage
pressures have eased more recently as
growth slowed.

The current account deficit increased sharply in 2007–08 (Table 2). While export
growth was robust, strong import growth led to an increase in the current account deficit to
9¾ percent of GDP in 2007. These trends accelerated in the first half of 2008. The deficit
began to narrow in the second half of 2008 as weaker import demand more than offset a
slowdown in exports due to a sharp fall in global commodity prices and weakening external
demand. However, it is still estimated at 10¼ percent of GDP for the year as a whole. The
deficits were financed by significant capital inflows, especially foreign direct investment
(FDI), keeping gross international reserves at $23 billion (about four months of imports
projected for 2009) at end-2008.

The overall fiscal balance in 2008 is estimated to have improved slightly
compared to 2007.1 A small deficit was recorded in the first three quarters of 2008, with
strong revenue performance—due to increases in trade and oil taxes as well as capital
revenue—mostly offsetting higher-than-budgeted expenditures. The latest estimates provided
by the authorities suggest that spending in the final quarter would raise the deficit to about
4¾ percent of GDP in 2008 as a whole (Table 3). The non-oil primary balance is estimated to
have improved by 1½ percentage points of GDP largely on account of lower capital spending.
These estimates are subject to considerable uncertainties relating to the actual disbursement of
investment projects and underlying weaknesses in the fiscal data.2
6.
The global turmoil has heightened Vietnam’s vulnerabilities. Exports of goods
and services, private remittances, and FDI have all slowed. Risk perception rose more
sharply than regional trends, prompting foreign investors to continue reducing their

expenditure and that from financing.

exposures to Vietnam, mainly by selling bonds.3 The stock market has declined by 75 percent
since end-2007. Depreciation pressures on the exchange rate have re-emerged, with the dong
depreciating by 9 percent vis-à-vis the U.S. dollar in 2008. Due to high domestic inflation,
however, the dong appreciated by 21 percent in real effective terms, much larger than other
countries in the region.

III. OUTLOOK AND RISKS
7.
The near-term outlook remains challenging, given the rapidly deteriorating
global economic conditions. Growth is currently projected to slow to 4¾ percent in 2009—
well below the authorities’ target of 6½ percent and historical average of 7½ percent—on the
back of weaker domestic and external demand. The global downturn is likely to reduce
export earnings, private remittances, and FDI, and hence domestic demand, resulting in
output falling below potential. Headline inflation is projected to drop to 6 percent (y/y) by

5 percent of total outstanding bonds, and about $3 billion of equities, or 30 percent of total market
capitalization.

end-2009 due to easing commodity prices, although core inflation could fall more gradually.4
The current account deficit is projected to decline to 8 percent of GDP, mainly due to lower
imports. However, tighter global financial conditions are expected to reduce capital inflows
significantly. With low levels of gross international reserves (projected to be about three
months of imports), Vietnam will remain vulnerable to external shocks.

8.
The near-term outlook is subject to increasing downside risks. A deeper, more
prolonged global downturn, especially in advanced economies, could worsen Vietnam’s
growth prospects. Low short-term external debt (at less than 10 percent of reserves) provides
some protection. However, lower exports and private remittances, especially if combined
with reduced capital inflows stemming from deteriorating global financial conditions or
investor sentiment, could put more pressures on reserves and the exchange rate. Moreover,
slower economic activity could heighten vulnerabilities in the banking system. The
authorities are aware of these risks.
9.
Nevertheless, the medium-term outlook is still favorable. Vietnam remains an
attractive destination for foreign investors. Provided that the government maintains sound
macroeconomic policies and continues reforms to enhance Vietnam’s competitiveness, real
GDP growth is expected to rise to 7½ percent by 2013 (Table 4). The current account deficit is
projected to narrow to about 5 percent of GDP by 2013, as export growth and private
remittances are likely to rebound. Capital inflows are also expected to pick up as investor
confidence recovers. The debt sustainability analysis (DSA) indicates that external debt levels
would be manageable, provided that external borrowing remains prudent. However, the
outlook for public sector debt is less favorable, underscoring the need for fiscal consolidation
to preserve debt sustainability in the medium term.

4

16

The minimum wage increase of 25–30 percent in January 2009 is unlikely to significantly affect inflation
since most workers in the private sector are already being paid above the minimum wage level.

9
IV. POLICY DISCUSSIONS
Discussions focused on (i) the appropriate mix of macroeconomic and financial policies to
address near-term vulnerabilities and (ii) structural reforms—in particular those related to
fiscal and SOE issues—essential to sustain Vietnam’s progress toward becoming a fullfledged emerging market economy.
A. Macroeconomic Policies: Balancing Growth and Stability Objectives
10.
With the balance of risks firmly shifting from inflation to growth, the authorities
have been rapidly easing macroeconomic policies. They have already taken a number of
measures, including a significant easing of fiscal and monetary policies and increasing
exchange rate flexibility and—more recently announced—a broad economic stimulus plan.
However, Vietnam’s external position is not as robust as other countries in the region,
constraining the government’s ability to pursue expansionary policies (Table 5). It is thus
important for the government to carefully balance growth and stability objectives and design
appropriate economic objectives and policies for 2009, while standing ready to adjust them
given considerable uncertainties surrounding the outlook.
Fiscal policy
Background
11.
The fiscal stance envisaged in the original 2009 budget plan (excluding the
stimulus plan) was already somewhat accommodative. Using staff’s revenue estimates,
which take into account lower world oil

1 percentage point of GDP).
5

According to the authorities’ definition of the overall fiscal balance (which includes debt amortization and
other items not consistent with GFS and excludes off-budget spending) and their revenue, expenditure, and
GDP estimates, the fiscal deficit-to-GDP ratio will improve from 5 percent in 2008 to 4.8 percent in 2009.

6

The tax changes include introduction of the new personal income tax (PIT) with more generous personal
allowances, and a reduction of the corporate income tax (CIT) rate from 28 to 25 percent.

12.
The recently announced stimulus plan aims to support growth, ensure social
security, and accelerate poverty reduction. The authorities are aiming to: (i) support
enterprises, especially small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), through temporary
interest rate subsidies, credit guarantees, delays in corporate income tax (CIT) payments, and a
30 percent temporary reduction in the tax liabilities; (ii) boost public investment including
through state-owned enterprises (SOEs), by frontloading existing projects and simplifying
budget execution procedures; (iii) stimulate private consumption through a reduction in valueadded tax (VAT) rate on certain products; (iv) support exports through a reduction in some
tariffs while increasing protection for certain domestic industries; and (v) enhance the social
safety net to protect vulnerable groups.7 The authorities have introduced various initiatives on
a piecemeal basis, but have not announced a revised budget plan for 2009. The stimulus plan
will clearly raise the fiscal deficit, but the extent of the increase is uncertain as details of the
plan have yet to be clearly determined.
Discussions
13.
Given deteriorating growth prospects, an accommodative fiscal stance in 2009
is appropriate. However, room for a fiscal stimulus is limited, especially given the already
large domestic financing envisaged in the original budget plan. Staff cautioned that in the
absence of additional concessional external financing, a stimulus package could further
weaken the external position, crowd out private sector activity, and undermine fiscal
sustainability prospects as indicated in the DSA. The authorities acknowledged these
concerns, but emphasized that supporting growth and employment was the top priority for
2009. Staff urged the authorities to prepare a revised budget plan for 2009 that elaborates on
how the fiscal stimulus would be financed.
14.
Staff stressed that the stimulus plan should focus on effective, well-targeted and
temporary measures and be financed through reprioritizing existing spending and/or
mobilizing additional concessional external financing. In this context, staff welcomed the
authorities’ plan to enhance the social safety net and accelerate existing high quality public
investment projects and those financed by official development assistance. However, the
proposed tax measures are likely to be ineffective in stimulating aggregate demand, are not
well targeted, and would complicate tax administration, while several trade tariff increases
would create additional distortions. Staff is also concerned that measures to support SMEs
may not be effective unless fundamental weaknesses of SMEs are addressed.

7

Other measures include: delaying PIT payments; accelerating VAT refund procedures for exporters and
lengthening the grace period on import duties for materials used in the production of exports, and speeding up
customs clearance process; and reducing import tariffs on goods used as inputs in domestic production, while
increasing export tariffs on natural resources and import tariffs on some domestically-produced goods.

The monetary policy stance has been adjusted swiftly in response to rapidly
changing economic conditions during 2008. The SBV took a number of commendable
steps to stabilize the overheating economy earlier in the year, notably through a significant
tightening during May–June 2008. It increased policy rates aggressively, tightened market

The authorities responded to depreciation pressures by increasing exchange rate
flexibility. In June 2008, the SBV devalued the dong against the U.S. dollar by 2.4 percent,

exchange market intervention. These measures, together with tighter monetary conditions,
helped stabilize the foreign exchange market. With monetary conditions having since eased
sharply and the economic outlook worsening, depreciation pressures on the dong re-emerged
in the final quarter of the year. The authorities have intervened in small amounts to support
the exchange rate, widened the band further to ±3 percent, and subsequently devalued the
dong-U.S. dollar rate by another 3 percent. Despite these efforts, the dong has continued to
trade at the weaker end of the band.
Discussions
17.
The authorities should assess how the recent significant monetary easing and
increased fiscal spending will feed through the economy before relaxing monetary
conditions any further. Staff emphasized that further monetary loosening may have only
limited impact in supporting growth, but could add to depreciation pressures on the dong.
The SBV was mindful that placing too much emphasis on growth could have negative
consequences on macroeconomic stability, but maintained that policies would need to be
accommodative to mitigate an economic downturn. In addition, aggressive monetary easing
by other central banks in the region and advanced countries has added peer pressures for the
SBV to move in tandem. On the SBV’s liquidity management framework, staff noted that
there remains ample room to strengthen open market operations and liquidity forecasting and
management, along the lines recommended by the Fund technical assistance (TA), which
would help reduce interest rate volatility and provide a clearer signal of the monetary
policy stance.
18.
Staff welcomed recent moves toward greater exchange rate flexibility, but noted
that the dong continues to face depreciation pressures. Staff’s exchange rate assessment
suggests that the dong is somewhat overvalued from a medium-term perspective (Box 1).
Staff recommended that if depreciation pressures persist, exchange rate flexibility be further
increased through a combination of widening the band and adjusting the official exchange
rate, supported by appropriate macroeconomic policies to boost credibility in the exchange
rate system. The scope for sustained foreign exchange market intervention is limited by the
relatively low level of reserves. Greater exchange rate flexibility would also help improve the
effectiveness of monetary policy, deepen the foreign exchange market, and pave the way for
a smooth transition to inflation targeting—a framework the authorities plan to adopt in the
future. The authorities agreed that increasing exchange rate flexibility was an appropriate
strategy, but stressed that they would allow the exchange rate to adjust only gradually to
avoid disruptions in confidence and economic activity.

13

Box 1. Equilibrium Exchange Rate Assessment
Three standard, model-based approaches indicate that the exchange rate is somewhat
overvalued compared with its medium-term equilibrium level.
The macroeconomic balance approach suggests some overvaluation. The current
account norm is estimated at a deficit of 2.6 percent of GDP. This can be explained by the
fact that Vietnam has a higher fiscal deficit, higher output growth, and a lower level of
economic development than its trading partners. The underlying current account deficit in
2008 is estimated at about 4 percent of GDP, taking into account a number of temporary
factors, including rapid credit growth and an investment boom by SOEs. In addition, the
current account deficit is projected to decline to 5 percent of GDP in 2013.

B. Addressing Financial Sector Vulnerabilities
Background
19.
Strains in the banking system emerged in 2008. Banking conditions were mainly
affected by tighter domestic liquidity conditions, higher interest rates, and a sharp decline in
asset prices in the first half of 2008 as well as slowing growth in the second half of the year.
Given high loan-to-deposit ratios and reliance on short-term interbank funding, a number of
banks experienced liquidity problems when Vietnam: Banking Indicators, 2006–08

loans in October 2008 (double the end2007 level), but provisioning coverage against NPLs at 82 percent appears sufficient, with
JSBs having a higher coverage (Table 8). The banking system on the whole is still expected
to report positive profits for 2008 due to higher noninterest income mainly through gains on
bond trading. While full year data are not yet available, a number of banks appear to have
strengthened further their capital base.10
20.
The year 2009 will be challenging for Vietnamese banks, with credit risk
expected to be the main concern. The rapid credit growth in the past two years, together
with the projected slowing in economic activity, could lead to asset quality problems. Banks
are heavily dependent on corporate lending (about two-thirds of total loans), default rates of
which, in particular among SMEs, are projected to rise. Banks are also exposed to the
property market through their reliance on collateral and mortgage loans (about 10 percent of
total loans), although conservative practices on loan-to-value ratios by banks (35–50 percent)

9

Vietnam’s Civil Code stipulates that financial institutions cannot charge lending rates exceeding 1.5 times the
base rate. The SBV has recently raised the lending rate cap of the People’s Credit Funds (savings and credit
cooperatives for rural households) to 1.65 times the base rate and allowed negotiable interest rates for consumer
and credit card loans.

10

The SBV doubled the minimum paid-in capital to 1 trillion dong by end-2008, and will increase it to 3 trillion
dong by end-2010. This primarily affected smaller JSBs. Some large JSBs have strengthened capital through
retained earnings and rights issuance to existing shareholders.

15
may help somewhat protect against a property market downturn. Foreign currency lending
(about 20 percent of total loans) could also potentially turn into NPLs if the dong weakens,
but banks indicated that most of the foreign currency loans were extended to companies such
as exporters which were naturally hedged against exchange rate risks. Banks also face
liquidity risks, especially smaller banks.
21.
Vulnerability varies across the types of banks. Smaller and some mid-sized JSBs
with weak liquidity position and rapid loan growth in the recent past are considered most
vulnerable to a

base and lower
provisioning, also remains a problem for state-owned commercial banks (SOCBs), which
account for about 50 percent of total banking system assets, although they may be able to
receive government support.11 Larger JSBs appear more stable and sound, as they have solid
profit margins and a more diversified revenue base and are well capitalized. Some also have
benefited from investment and knowledge transfer by major foreign banks in recent years.
22.
Overall, banks’ strengthened capital position may help Vietnamese banks
mitigate the impact from the economic slowdown.12 Nevertheless, significant
shortcomings in financial transparency and banking supervision complicate the analysis of
banking vulnerabilities in Vietnam. The SBV has yet to release financial soundness
indicators (FSIs), such as capital adequacy or profitability. Moreover, only a few of the
41 commercial banks publish detailed financial statements and disclose FSIs in their annual
reports. There are also gaps in the Vietnamese accounting standards with regard to valuation
of financial instruments and fixed assets.

11

Two SOCBs have large exposure to loans classified as special mention (1–90 days overdue or first time
restructured) which require a 5 percent provisioning. These loans could become NPLs, especially in an
economic downturn.
12

Staff’s simple credit stress test—based on available market information for 35 banks (out of 41 banks)
covering about 95 percent of the domestic banking system (excluding foreign bank branches)—suggests that
most banks would remain solvent even if NPLs tripled from current levels and assuming zero profitability.

16
Discussions
23.
The authorities broadly agreed with staff’s assessment of the banking sector and
associated risks, but were more sanguine on the outlook. While recognizing the potential
vulnerabilities stemming from an economic downturn, the authorities reiterated that the
liquidity-related stresses in the banking system that emerged in mid-2008 had been
addressed, and that risks are under control. They noted that JSBs have been closely
monitored, in particular the smaller ones considered at risk, and that banks have increased
capital and set aside adequate provisions, while strengthening their risk management
systems. They added that there have so far been no major bank runs or failures despite the
global financial crisis and heightened market volatility.
24.
Staff emphasized the importance of closely monitoring developments and
addressing any rising vulnerabilities in the banking system in a timely and effective
manner. Vulnerable banks should be placed under close supervisory watch, and banks
should formulate a restructuring plan in the event their capital falls below certain critical
levels. Staff also recommended that SOCBs address provisioning shortfalls in a timely
manner and cautioned against channeling directed policy lending programs through them.
The authorities pointed out that while the SBV is not given a well-defined mandate to
intervene in troubled banks, such banks could be handled by measures—such as mergers,
withdrawal of licenses, and recapitalization—which have been used in the past.
25.
The authorities acknowledged the importance of developing an effective
contingency plan to deal with the impact of the global turmoil. They indicated that, if
needed, necessary measures would be taken to secure financial system stability. In this
context, staff noted that a number of countries had prepared such plans, key elements of
which include a temporary blanket guarantee covering all bank liabilities to minimize the risk
of any runs on deposits,13 temporary emergency liquidity support to illiquid but solvent banks
subject to strict conditions, a broadening of the existing lender of last resort support system,
and a restructuring or liquidation of insolvent banks, including through mergers and bank
recapitalization with public funds, subject to appropriate and transparent restructuring
conditions and safeguards against moral hazard.
26.
It was agreed that banking supervision needs to be further strengthened. Recent
initiatives to undertake large-scale onsite supervision, enforce strict limits on securitiesrelated lending, raise minimum capital requirements for banks, strengthen loan classification
and provisioning rules, and apply strict conditions on the provision of liquidity support, have
all enhanced the SBV’s oversight of the banking system. The decision to tighten criteria and
conditions for granting licenses to new banks and to integrate regulatory and supervisory

bank, but excludes foreign currency deposits. The current limit covers about 90 percent of depositors.

17
functions in a single department within the SBV is also welcome. Main priorities going
forward include upgrading banks’ reporting requirements, introducing stress testing as an
offsite supervisory tool, establishing an early warning system, and strengthening the SBV’s
onsite supervision program. The SBV should also strictly enforce compliance with prudential
rules and address gaps in the accounting regulations. The authorities broadly agreed with
these priorities and indicated that the new banking supervision department would be able to
undertake more effective supervision. In addition, they were hopeful that the Fund’s longterm resident advisor would help enhance the SBV’s supervisory practices.
27.
Staff urged the authorities to sustain the momentum for financial sector reforms.
The authorities’ plan to amend laws on the SBV and credit institutions in 2010 is welcome.
Staff underscored the importance of strengthening the SBV’s operational autonomy and
clearly defining the objectives of monetary policy and banking supervision. In particular, the
new SBV law should spell out the SBV’s legal authority and operational autonomy,
including the power to supervise banks and to intervene in banks, if necessary. The
authorities noted that these reforms are currently under discussion and requested IMF support
in advancing them.
C. Structural Reform Priorities
Fiscal reform
Background
28.
The authorities have been taking a number of steps to preserve debt
sustainability. Tax reforms include the introduction of a new PIT, and revision of the CIT,
VAT, excise taxes, and tariffs on petroleum products. However, these reforms are unlikely to
provide adequate revenue support, especially in the short run. On the expenditure side, the
authorities are planning to move a significant portion of public investment into public-private
partnership projects (PPPs). To ensure fiscal sustainability, the authorities are considering
introducing a limit on government debt and balancing the budget in the long run. The
authorities are also planning to introduce a new budget law in 2010, which is expected to
cover a broad range of issues, including plans to develop a medium-term fiscal framework,
reform fiscal decentralization, and introduce performance-based budgeting. The new law
may also help address serious fiscal data shortcomings.
Discussions
29.
Staff stressed the importance of a longer-term framework of revenue and
expenditure management. While the recent tax reforms are welcome, staff underscored the
need for further efforts to identify alternative revenue sources, particularly in light of
anticipated revenue declines associated with WTO commitments and in the longer run a
decline in oil production. The authorities agreed with staff’s view and requested IMF TA to
help develop the next phase of their revenue reform strategy, which will focus on property,

18
environmental, and natural resource tax laws currently under preparation. They also noted
that a large taxpayer office was under consideration, which could increase the tax yield. Staff
also recommended that expenditure structure be reviewed to improve the efficiency of public
investment while ensuring sufficient protection to vulnerable groups, and cautioned against
the fiscal risks arising from contingent liabilities associated with PPPs. Such projects would
require a solid investment planning framework, a strong legal and institutional framework,
and a clear, comprehensive, and transparent accounting framework. A careful assessment of
fiscal and macroeconomic risks associated with PPPs would also be crucial.
30.
The initiative to revise the state budget law is welcome. Staff called for its careful
planning and implementation, especially in the areas of fiscal decentralization and
performance-based budgeting, to avoid complicating fiscal management. Bringing the
definition of the budget balance closer to international standards, including elimination of
off-budget transactions, would facilitate fiscal policy decision-making and help inform the
public about fiscal policy stance and direction.
SOE reform
Background
31.
The pace of SOE reform has slowed significantly, and the economic slowdown
appears to have weakened its momentum. There were approximately 1,800 SOEs at the
end of 2007, accounting for about 40 percent of GDP and 30 percent of credit to the
economy. Assessing the financial position of the SOE sector remains difficult in the absence
of information on their performance, but it is expected that the financial position of some of
the larger SOEs has come under increased strain in 2008.
Discussions
32.
Staff stressed the need to advance SOE reform. The authorities should step up the
monitoring of SOEs and identify and restructure those representing significant fiscal risks.
They should also press ahead with the equitization process (including SOCBs) as market
conditions improve, which would help strengthen the performance and governance of SOEs,
especially if the participation of foreign strategic investors is broadened. The authorities
reiterated their commitment to SOE reform, recognizing that it would help sustain Vietnam’s
rapid economic development. The authorities explained that the slower-than-expected
equitization process was due to unfavorable market conditions and intend to press ahead with
their plans to equitize the remaining nonstrategic SOEs.
d

V. OTHER ISSUES
33.
Staff emphasized that an effective public communication strategy will help
bolster investor confidence, which is needed especially in the difficult period ahead. The
SBV has taken steps to improve its communication, by providing updated monetary and

19
reserves data on the Fund’s website, posting weekly statements on monetary and banking
operations on its newly launched English-language website, and organizing regular press
conferences and interviews. Another important step for the SBV is to more clearly
communicate its stance on monetary and exchange rate policy to the public. More generally,
government agencies should present policy initiatives in a coordinated, consistent, and
comprehensive manner.
34.
The authorities should improve the quality and timeliness of data, especially in
the fiscal, SOE, and banking sectors. Higher quality fiscal and SOE data would allow for
better analysis of fiscal developments and the policy stance. There is a significant perception
gap on the banking sector soundness between the public and the authorities. Posting regularly
key financial soundness indicators of the banking system on the SBV’s website could help
close the gap. The SBV indicated that efforts will be made to provide more information to
the public, in line with practices of central banks and regulatory agencies in the region. They
also agreed that the provision of financial information of SOEs would help foster a better
understanding of their soundness.
VI. STAFF APPRAISAL
35.
Vietnam made significant progress last year in stabilizing an overheating
economy, but is now facing substantial challenges amid the volatile global environment.
Growth is expected to slow in 2009. While the current account deficit is likely to remain large,
capital inflows would decline significantly. The government has rapidly eased macroeconomic
policies and recently announced a broad stimulus plan to support growth. However, Vietnam’s
fragile external position places a constraint on its ability to pursue expansionary policies.
36.
Against the background of deteriorating growth prospects, an accommodative
fiscal stance in 2009 is appropriate. Given the already substantial domestic financing
requirement and the weak external position, however, there is limited room for a fiscal
stimulus in the absence of additional concessional external financing. The government should
focus on measures that are effective and temporary, while ensuring that these measures are
calibrated to fit within available fiscal and macroeconomic space. In this context, the
authorities’ intention to enhance the social safety net and expedite existing efficient public
investment projects is appropriate. However, many tax measures and those to support SMEs
may not be effective, and the use of import and export tariffs will cause distortions.
37.
The effects of recent significant policy adjustments should be assessed before
monetary conditions are eased further. Given a stalled credit market, further monetary
action may have limited impact on growth, and instead increase depreciation pressures on the
dong. To increase policy effectiveness, greater efforts should be made to improve open
market operations and liquidity forecasting and management.
38.
A move toward a more flexible exchange rate regime is an appropriate strategy.
Notwithstanding moves to widen the trading band and devalue the exchange rate, the dong

20
continues to face depreciation pressures. Staff’s exchange rate assessment also suggests that
the dong is somewhat overvalued compared with its medium-term equilibrium level. If
depreciation pressures persist, exchange rate flexibility should be further increased,
supported by appropriate macroeconomic policies to maintain confidence in the dong.
39.
Safeguarding banking sector soundness is high priority. While commendable
efforts have been made, the SBV needs to improve supervision further and address
vulnerabilities in a timely and effective manner. Having a contingent plan to deal with the
global financial turmoil is also useful. Over the medium term, advancing financial sector
reform will be crucial, in particular strengthening the SBV’s operational autonomy.
40.
A longer-term revenue and expenditure framework will help preserve fiscal
sustainability. While the recent tax reforms are a key step in this direction, further efforts are
needed to broaden the tax base. The expenditure structure should be reviewed to increase
efficiency of public investment and ensure adequate protection for vulnerable groups. It is
also important to minimize risks associated with PPPs. The initiative to revise the state
budget law is timely, but requires careful planning and implementation.
41.
The authorities should press ahead with SOE reform. Given their large role in the
economy, efforts should be stepped up to monitor SOEs and identify and restructure those
representing significant risks. Continuing the equitization process for SOEs and SOCBs
would be critical in helping to improve their efficiency and governance.
42.
An effective public communication strategy and increased data availability will
help bolster investor confidence. While steps have been taken to improve communication
and data provision, the quality and timeliness of data, especially in the fiscal, SOE, and
banking sectors, need to be strengthened.
43.
It is recommended that the next Article IV consultation take place on the standard
12-month cycle.

VIETNAM
Joint IMF/World Bank Debt Sustainability Analysis 20081
Prepared by the staffs of the International Monetary Fund and
the International Development Association
Approved by Kalpana Kochhar and Tessa van der Willigen (IMF)
and Carlos Braga and Vikram Nehru (IDA)
February 27, 2009
This document presents the joint IMF-World Bank debt sustainability analysis (DSA) for
Vietnam using the Debt Sustainability Framework for Low-Income Countries (LIC).2
Vietnam remains at low risk of debt distress despite the recent deterioration in its economic
conditions and the global downturn. 3 All external debt sustainability indicators are projected
to remain well below the applicable debt thresholds, reflecting Vietnam’s mostly
concessional and long-term structure of external debt, as well as its dynamic export sector.
The outlook of public sector debt (including domestic debt) is less favorable, underscoring
the need for fiscal consolidation to preserve debt sustainability in the medium term.

This DSA was prepared jointly by the IMF and World Bank. The staffs also consulted with the Asian
Development Bank. The debt data underlying this exercise were provided by the Vietnamese authorities and
donor partners. Data for end-2008 and beyond are staff estimates.

The low-income country debt sustainability framework (LIC DSF) recognizes that better policies and
institutions allow countries to manage higher levels of debt, and thus the threshold levels are policy dependent.
Vietnam’s policies and institutions, as measured by the World Bank’s Country Policy and Institutional
Assessment (CPIA), averaged 3.8 percent over the past three years, placing it as a “strong performer.” The
relevant indicative thresholds for this category are: 50 percent for the present value (PV) of debt-to-GDP ratio,
200 percent for the PV of debt-to-exports ratio, 300 percent for the PV of debt-to-revenue ratio, 25 percent for
the debt service-to-exports ratio, and 35 percent for the debt service-to-revenue ratio. These thresholds are
applicable to public- and publicly-guaranteed external debt.

2
I. BACKGROUND AND BASELINE ASSUMPTIONS
1.
Vietnam’s external debt position has historically been robust. Most of its debt is
concessional, carrying a low average, fixed interest rate, and long maturity with no bunching
of repayments. With support from a variety of multilateral and bilateral creditors,4 it also has
a fairly diversified currency composition. Vietnam has access to strong private remittances,
which help to finance its trade deficit, and large foreign direct investment (FDI) inflows
which provide significant non-debt-creating financing. The stock market has also received
strong inflows until recently. Moreover, the government has been prudent in external
borrowing, with total external public debt estimated at 25 percent of GDP (30 percent
including the private sector) in 2008.
2.
The domestic public debt position also remains manageable. Total domestic public
debt (including Vietnam Development Bank) is estimated at only 19.7 percent of GDP at
end-2008. The average implied interest rate as of end-2008 was about 6 percent, although this is
expected to rise in nominal terms because of higher inflation. The bulk of amortization will fall
due within one to three years.
3.
The assessment of Vietnam’s debt situation has not changed significantly since the
last DSA despite the recent deterioration in economic conditions. External borrowing has
been limited, as the larger current account deficit has been largely financed by higher FDI
inflows and some short-term borrowing by banks. Domestic financing of the government
deficit is estimated to have risen by about 2 percentage points of GDP to 3½ percent of GDP
in 2008. However, government borrowing could be much less if the bulk of the deficit were
financed by drawing down the government’s sizeable deposits.
4.
The main baseline assumptions underlying the DSA are summarized in Box 1. A
critical assumption is that Vietnam will continue to pursue sound macroeconomic and financial
policies and structural reforms to support growth and continue further poverty reduction. Based
on these assumptions, the non-interest current account deficit is projected to decline from about
9½ percent of GDP in 2008 to about 4 percent in 2013 and remain broadly unchanged thereafter.
II. EXTERNAL DEBT SUSTAINABILITY ANALYSIS5
5.
Public- and publicly-guaranteed (PPG) external debt is likely to remain
manageable, with all external debt ratios projected to be well within the indicative
thresholds. Although the current account deficit has increased markedly since the last DSA,
non-debt-creating financing has also risen considerably. Higher GDP in dollar terms also

of remaining maturity) is under
10 percent of gross foreign exchange reserves, indicating resilience in the face of sudden
capital withdrawals.
Box 1: Key Macroeconomic Assumptions for Baseline Scenario (2009–28)
Real GDP growth will average 6½ percent per year during 2009–13 (below the 10-year historical
average of 7.2 percent), and thereafter will decline gradually, as Vietnam’s level of development and
demography begins to converge to those of more advanced neighbors. Gross domestic investment is
expected to decline from 41½ percent of GDP in 2008 to about 35 percent in 2028, while domestic
savings remaining at the current level of about 31 percent of GDP.
Inflation will decline from 23 percent on average in 2008 to 6 percent by end-2009 mainly due to lower
commodity prices, and will remain at that level through 2013. Thereafter, a further decline is assumed
reflecting productivity gains.
Average interest rates on foreign borrowing will gradually rise from around 3 percent during 2008 to
above 4 percent by 2028, as the share of concessional loans in total debt gradually declines.
Net capital inflows will fall from about 10 percent to GDP in 2008 to 8 percent in 2013 and stabilize
thereafter. The non-debt-creating part of FDI will decline from about 7 percent of GDP in 2008 to under
4 percent in 2028. Concessional official development assistance is assumed to increase slightly from
$1.7 billion in 2008 to $2.2 billion in 2018 before falling to $1.1 billion by 2028. Commercial
borrowing will remain broadly constant (with some fluctuations) at around 1½ percent of GDP.
The primary fiscal deficit (including off-budget expenditures and net lending) will rise to 6½ percent
of GDP in 2009 and gradually decline to 3 percentage points of GDP in 2013 and further to 2 percent of
GDP on average during 2014–28. Expenditures will fall by about 2 percentage points of GDP to
30 percent of GDP between 2009–13, with a rise in current expenditure more than offset by a decline in
capital and off-budget expenditure and net lending. Revenue will also increase by about 1 percentage
point of GDP to 25 percent of GDP between 2009–13. Beyond 2013, expenditures will remain broadly
constant in percent of GDP, while revenue will rise further to 27 percent of GDP by 2028 as the
government finds alternative revenue sources, assumed to more than offset a decline in oil revenue.
Government financing (excluding the possible impact from a government stimulus plan, which is not
incorporated in the baseline) will increase by about 3½ percentage points of GDP in 2009, mostly
through domestic financing. During 2009–13, government financing will decline by 3 percentage points
of GDP, mainly through lower domestic financing. The mix of financing will remain broadly stable
thereafter.
Contingent liabilities or exceptional financing items are not assumed.

4
6.
Under the baseline scenario, the present value (PV) of PPG external debt is
projected to initially rise in relation to GDP, exports, and government revenue,
followed by a decline over the longer term. In terms of averages over the whole
projection period, these ratios are projected to remain broadly constant relative to the base
period. With Vietnam being a very dynamic and open economy, the PV of external debt as a
share of exports is low and projected to decline from 22½ percent in 2007 to 13½ percent in
2028. The debt service ratio (to exports and to revenue) is also expected to decline after an
initial increase.
7.
Stress tests indicate that the PV of PPG external debt is most sensitive to
exchange rate depreciation and to a loss of access to non-debt-creating flows. A
30 percent one-time depreciation of the dong would increase the PV of external debt in
relation to GDP by 8 percentage points relative to the baseline, and a loss of access to
non-debt-creating flows by 3 percentage points by 2013. A loss of access to concessional
loans would have a similar negative impact albeit over a longer time horizon (5–10 years).
III. PUBLIC DEBT SUSTAINABILITY ANALYSIS
8.
Public debt management is likely to become more challenging, with its ratio to
GDP now projected to be higher than in the last DSA due to a significant deterioration
in the overall fiscal balance. The PV of public debt in relation to GDP is projected to rise
from 37 percent in 2008 to 46 percent in 2013, and thereafter gradually decline to 43 percent
by 2028. This ratio could be higher depending upon the size of fiscal stimulus which is being
worked out. The debt service-to-revenue ratio is expected to increase from 6 percent in 2008
to 11½ percent in 2013 due to lower oil revenue, before starting to gradually decline.
9.
Stress tests indicate that the PV of public debt to GDP ratio is most sensitive to an
increase in debt-creating flows followed by an exchange rate depreciation. Both a one-time
30 percent nominal depreciation of the dong and an increase in debt-creating flows by
10 percentage points of GDP would increase the PV of public debt (relative to the baseline) by
7–8 percentage points by 2013. However, even the most extreme negative shock would not
destabilize (cause to rise indefinitely) the PV ratios over the longer term.6
10.
The stress tests underscore the need for prudent fiscal policy. The debt service-torevenue ratio would triple or more (relative to its initial level) under the higher debt-creating
flows scenario and under the depreciation scenario. Under a permanently lower GDP growth it
would double by 2013.

6

In addition to the favorable structure of external debt, this reflects the fact that the bulk of domestic debt is
also long term.

5
IV. CONCLUSION
11.
Vietnam remains at low risk of external debt distress. Compared with the last
DSA, the projected PPG external debt ratios and projected paths are more favorable, and
remain well below indicative thresholds even under the most extreme of the standard shocks
normally considered.
12.
Total public debt, however, is expected to be adversely affected by the ongoing
global downturn. Public debt will also be affected by the government stimulus plan to
mitigate the economic slowdown. Provided that the package is prudently financed, and that the
government increases the revenue base to more than offset the expected loss of oil revenue in
the long run, the burden of public debt could be manageable.
13.
However, the results are critically dependent on the assumptions underlying
the projections. The most important of these include: (i) sound monetary and fiscal policies
and boosting non-oil revenue as oil production declines in the long run; (ii) healthy export
growth and continued dynamism of the Vietnamese economy more generally; (iii) continued
access to non-debt-creating external financing, especially private remittances and FDI; and
(iv) continued access to concessional financing by multilateral and bilateral sources.
14.
A risk that deserves special attention is the possible impact of potential
government contingent liabilities. Such liabilities could arise from the need to recapitalize
some banks or to deal with problems in state-owned enterprises. The size of the fiscal
stimulus and its financing is also important.

Includes both public and private sector external debt.
Historical averages and standard deviations are generally derived over the past 10 years, subject to data availability.
Derived as [r - g - r(1+g)]/(1+g+r+gr) times previous period debt ratio, with r = nominal interest rate; g = real GDP growth rate, and r = growth rate of GDP deflator in U.S. dollar terms.
Includes exceptional financing (i.e., changes in arrears and debt relief); changes in gross foreign assets; and valuation adjustments. For projections also includes contribution from price and exchange rate changes.
Assumes that PV of private sector debt is equivalent to its face value.
Current-year interest payments divided by previous period debt stock.
Defined as grants, concessional loans, and debt relief.
Grant-equivalent financing includes grants provided directly to the government and through new borrowing (difference between the face value and the PV of new debt).

1/ Variables include real GDP growth, growth of GDP deflator (in U.S. dollar terms), non-interest current account in percent of GDP, and non-debt creating flows.
2/ Assumes that the interest rate on new borrowing is by 2 percentage points higher than in the baseline., while grace and maturity periods are the same as in the baseline.
3/ Exports values are assumed to remain permanently at the lower level, but the current account as a share of GDP is assumed to return to its baseline level after the shock (implicitly assuming
an offsetting adjustment in import levels).
4/ Includes official and private transfers and FDI.
5/ Depreciation is defined as percentage decline in dollar/local currency rate, such that it never exceeds 100 percent.
6/ Applies to all stress scenarios except for A2 (less favorable financing) in which the terms on all new financing are as specified in footnote 2.

Exchange Arrangement:

Vietnam’s exchange rate system is currently classified as an “other managed arrangement.”
The State Bank of Vietnam (SBV) sets the central rate vis-à-vis the U.S. dollar on a daily
basis and allows interbank foreign exchange market rates to fluctuate by ±3 percent. The
SBV increased exchange rate flexibility substantially during 2008, by widening the dongU.S. dollar trading band from ±0.75 to ±3 percent on three separate occasions. In 2007, the
trading band was widened twice from ±0.25 to ±0.75 percent.

3
Vietnam maintains an exchange system free of restrictions on the making of payments and
transfers for current international transactions, except for those exchange restrictions imposed
for security reasons of which Vietnam has notified the Fund pursuant to Executive Board
Decision No. 144-(52/51), 8/14/52.
VIII. Article IV Consultations:
Vietnam is on a 12-month consultation cycle. The last Article IV consultation was held in
Hanoi during June 18–27, 2007 and was concluded by the Executive Board on October 26,
2007 (IMF Country Report No. 07/387). In addition, staff visits took place in December 2007
as well as April and September 2008.
IX.

Technical Assistance:

Technical assistance is currently focused on monetary operations, banking supervision, tax
policy and administration, and AML/CFT. A resident advisor began assisting the SBV in the
area of banking supervision in December 2008.

Resident Representative:

Mr. Benedict Bingham assumed the Senior Resident Representative post for Vietnam and

ANNEX II. VIETNAM: RELATIONS WITH THE WORLD BANK GROUP1
A. Partnership in Vietnam’s Development Strategy
A new Country Partnership Strategy (CPS) was presented to the World Bank Board in
February 2007. The CPS is fully aligned to Vietnam’s Socio-Economic Development Plan
(SEDP) 2006–10 and sets out the World Bank’s planned support between FY07 and FY11.
The objectives of the SEDP are mapped into four broad pillars which are the organizing
principles of the CPS: (i) improving the business environment; (ii) strengthening social
inclusion; (iii) strengthening environmental and natural resource management; and
(iv) improving governance.
A common theme underlining the four pillars is the need to complete the remaining firstgeneration structural reforms, while moving forward on a set of ambitious second-generation
reforms. The former group relates to the transition to a market economy and the restructuring
of the state sector. The latter group focuses on the institutional underpinnings for the
operation of a more complex economy, as Vietnam becomes a middle-income country.
Through these reforms, the role of the Government will be transformed from direct producer
of goods and services to regulator and provider of the foundations for a well-functioning,
equitable, modern market economy.
Improving the Business Environment: Support for this theme focuses on banking reform and
overall financial sector development; improved competitiveness with fuller integration with
the world economy, including through improved quality, efficiency, and equity of the higher
education system; a more level playing field for enterprises; a better foundation for
knowledge-based growth and enhancing agricultural competitiveness; and investment in
more efficient and reliable infrastructure.
Strengthening Social Inclusion: Priorities for World Bank Group support are better
understanding of poverty and piloting new instruments to reach the poor; mainstreaming
gender issues across the portfolio and including people with disabilities in the development
process; increasing access to and quality of basic infrastructure services for the rural poor;
increasing access to affordable and better quality education and health care services;
including and empowering ethnic minorities in the development process; improving policies
and services to address the needs of urban poor and migrants; and reducing vulnerability to
adverse shocks, including natural disasters and climatic hazards.
Strengthening Environmental and Natural Resource Management: Rapid economic growth is
putting the environment under increasing stress. The livelihoods of poor people in Vietnam

5
still depend overwhelmingly on natural resources. The World Bank’s activities will focus on
livelihood-supporting roles and public benefits of better management of the environment and
natural resources. In practice, this will raise a range of challenges related to regional
planning; land, forestry, water resources and integrated river basin management; and the
introduction of modern tools for environmental protection.
Improving Governance: Progress across the first three pillars will require institutions with
enhanced transparency, accountability, and stakeholder voice and participation. World Bank
support under this pillar will focus on strengthening public financial management,
simplifying administrative procedures, and modernizing the planning process through more
participatory approaches and greater accountability of public service providers for
achievement of development outcomes.
B. World Bank Group Strategy and Lending
The World Bank Group is employing a broad range of instruments, elaborated in the CPS, to
support the objectives laid out in the SEDP 2006–10 and other key strategies of the
Government. These instruments include the World Bank’s Poverty Reduction Support
Credits (PRSCs), other development policy and investment operations, and analytical and
advisory activities; the IFC’s equity, loan and technical assistance (TA) participations and the
Mekong Private Sector Development Facility (MPDF); Multilateral Investment Guarantee
Agency (MIGA) activities; and donor partnerships and ODA coordination.
Scale of the World Bank Group Program: The World Bank’s operational program is
calibrated based on an assumption of annual IDA envelopes on the order of $900 million
equivalent. Actual allocations depend on Vietnam’s performance relative to other potential
IDA recipients and on the overall resource envelope. At $1.2 billion equivalent, the FY08
IDA program significantly surpassed that of prior years (see Table 1). Vietnam is now the
second largest IDA-only borrower after Bangladesh, and the third largest user of IDA
resources after India and Bangladesh. There are currently 40 active IDA credits totaling
$4.6 billion equivalent, of which $1.2 billion has been disbursed. The IFC and MIGA
programs are also expected to grow in the coming years.
IBRD Eligibility: During the CPS period, Vietnam’s GNI per capita is projected to move
steadily towards the IDA graduation threshold. In FY08 the World Bank confirmed
Vietnam’s eligibility for IBRD borrowing. The first IBRD operation is planned for FY09. In
the initial phase of Vietnam’s IBRD/IDA blend status, IBRD borrowing is expected to be
incremental to, as opposed to substituting for, IDA financing.
Lending Program: The ongoing second series of five Poverty Reduction Support Credits
(PRSCs VI-X) is the centerpiece of the World Bank’s lending program during the CPS
period. These operations support the reforms envisaged chiefly in the SEDP 2006–10, which
also serves as the Poverty Reduction Strategy (PRS) for Vietnam. PRSC VII ($150 million

equivalent) was approved by the World Bank’s Board in June 2008. The five PRSC
operations in the first series mainly supported implementation of the Government’s
Comprehensive Poverty Reduction and Growth Strategy. PRSC I, a two-tranche operation for
$250 million equivalent, was approved by the World Bank’s Board in June 2001. It focused
on structural reforms in trade liberalization, the financial sector, SOEs, and private sector
development. Subsequent PRSCs have had significantly broader scope and supported policy
actions in areas such as health, social protection, education, and environmental protection and
natural resource management. They have also included actions to build modern governance
systems in Vietnam, such as those aimed at public financial management and public
administration reform, and fighting corruption. The number of PRSC co-financiers has
increased from 4 for PRSC I to 12 with contributions exceeding $200 million for PRSC VII.
In addition to providing resources, PRSCs serve as an effective donor coordination device as
well as a single, unified platform for policy dialogue between Vietnam’s partners and the
Government on a broad range of issues. The World Bank’s operational program also includes
sector development and investment operations aligned with the four pillars of the CPS. A
sector development policy operation supported poverty reduction, while well over half of
sector investment commitments have financed infrastructure projects, with the balance
focused on the health and education sectors, rural development, and public administration
reform. Forthcoming World Bank operations will likely exceed $1 billion in each of the next
two fiscal years, again with well over half to finance infrastructure investments.
Knowledge Program: The World Bank supports the Government’s efforts to strengthen
institutional capacity through its knowledge program of analytical and advisory services. The
annual Vietnam Development Reports (VDRs), written in coordination with a large number
of donors and submitted to the annual year-end Consultative Group meeting, summarize the
accumulated knowledge in a specific policy area of Vietnam’s reform agenda. Recent VDRs
have focused on tackling the challenges to attainment of SEDP objectives (2007) as well as
thematic areas such as social protection (2008), business development (2006), and
governance (2005). The next VDR will focus on financing Vietnam’s development. Other
reports during this period included Infrastructure Finance, Higher Education and Skills for
Growth, Country Financial Accountability Assessment, Policy Agenda for Health Sector
Transition, and a series on Vietnam’s Infrastructure Challenges. Forthcoming reports include
High Quality Education for All, Health Financing, Financial Sector Strategy, Infrastructure
Regulatory and Policy Reform, Regional Development and Integrated Urbanization, and
Prioritizing Climate Change Investments. In addition, the World Bank continues to provide
advisory services in areas such as tax policy, social security, and public financial
management reform.
C. IMF-World Bank Collaboration in Specific Areas
Since the expiration of the PRGF in April 2004 the two institutions have closely collaborated
in the discussions of PRSC triggers and benchmarks in the policy areas which used to be

8
covered by the PRGF agreement. The IMF has provided Letters of Assessment in support of
PRSC operations. In the area of public financial management, the World Bank has an
investment credit to support the introduction of a modern Treasury and Budget Management
Information System, and coordinates technical inputs on a large multi-donor trust fund for
public financial management reform. The World Bank is also following up on the technical
assistance provided by the IMF in relation to tax reform and revenue management. An
investment credit for tax administration reform has been set up to this effect. Joint work is
also under way in support of the establishment of a modern central bank, with the IMF
providing technical assistance on monetary policy and operations and both the World Bank
and IMF providing technical assistance on banking supervision. The World Bank has also set
up an investment credit to reorganize the State Bank of Vietnam and to develop appropriate
information management systems.
Since 2005, the World Bank and the IMF have jointly prepared an annual Debt Sustainability
Assessment. More recently, they joined efforts in commenting on the direction and contents
of the SEDP 2006–10, including a Joint Staff Advisory Note submitted to the World Bank
Board in December 2006. The IMF and the World Bank also collaborate in the development
and timely dissemination of reliable economic and financial statistics. The IMF focuses on
improving balance of payments, and national accounts, and price statistics, while the World
Bank provides assistance on issues related to the production of high-quality household and
enterprise surveys.
The two institutions have coordinated closely on the recent macroeconomic turbulence faced
by Vietnam. Their joint inputs to government have been instrumental in the adoption of the
stabilization package of March 2008 and its subsequent implementation.

9
ANNEX III. VIETNAM: RELATIONS WITH THE ASIAN DEVELOPMENT BANK
The Asian Development Bank (AsDB) resumed its operations in Vietnam in October 1993.
The Country Strategy and Program (CSP) 2007–10 was endorsed in October 2006 and is
fully aligned with and supports implementation of the Government’s Socio-Economic
Development Plan (SEDP) 2006–10. The goals of the CSP are to help the Government
reduce poverty incidence to 10–11 percent of households by 2010, achieve the Millennium
Development Goals/ Vietnam Development Goals and exit from low-income country status.
The new CSP focuses its operations on: (i) Business-led, Pro-poor Economic Growth: AsDB
support aims to help the Government develop the foundations for increased private sector
investment and employment; (ii) Social Equity and Balanced Development: in addition to
supporting education, health, targeted poverty reduction, and rural infrastructure, the CSP
addresses communicable diseases such as avian influenza and HIV/AIDS; gender and other
equity issues are mainstreamed in AsDB projects; (iii) Environment: the CSP supports
natural resources management, emphasizing the link between resources depletion and
persistent poverty, through assistance on biodiversity, water, and coastal resources
management and livelihood improvement. Governance is addressed through all AsDB
operations and regional cooperation is strongly supported through a number of projects.
From October 1993 until end 2008, the AsDB approved 78 public sector loans totaling over
$6 billion, comprising $4 billion from highly concessional Asian Development Fund (ADF)
and $2 billion from less concessional Ordinary Capital Resources (OCR). The contract
awards achievement in 2008 was $390.4 million as compared with $261 million in 2007.
Disbursement in 2008 attained $264.6 million as compared with $229.9 million in 2007. The
AsDB has also extended technical assistance grants amounting to $175 million for
225 projects. In addition to public sector operations, the AsDB has provided $220 million for
eight private sector loans, as well as $60 million in guarantees under two projects. Vietnam
also receives substantial support under the Greater Mekong Subregion (GMS) initiatives,
involving Cambodia, China, Lao P.D.R, Myanmar, Thailand and Vietnam.
Support for policy and structural reforms to improve public sector efficiency and to
encourage the development of the private sector is a vital component of AsDB operations in
Vietnam. So far, the AsDB has approved 15 policy-based program loans in the agricultural
sector, the financial sector, SOE reform and corporate governance and public administration
reform, SME development and in support of the multi-donor supported Poverty Reduction
Support Credit (PRSC). AsDB’s policy dialogue included support for increased efficiency of
state-owned utilities through reforming their rate structure and other measures to increase
cost recovery and to strengthen financial management, policy analysis, and planning. A highlevel capacity building program is also in place under the Japan Fund for Public Policy
Training (JFPPT) funded by the Government of Japan.

10
Following a reorganization of AsDB’s regional departments in May 2006, Vietnam is
covered by the Southeast Asia Department, along with Cambodia, Brunei Darussalam,
Lao P.D.R., Myanmar, Thailand, Malaysia, Philippines, Indonesia and Singapore. The
resident mission has been gradually strengthened and is responsible for country economic
monitoring, programming and donor coordination functions, in addition to administration of
36 percent of the ongoing loan portfolio. The resident mission has helped the government
prepare the results-based SEDP 2006–2010, through a broad, consultative process, including
preparing the results framework for monitoring SEDP outcomes. To implement the principles
of the Paris Declaration on Aid Effectiveness, the resident mission actively participates in the
Partnership Group on Aid Effectiveness with the Government and other development
partners, taking a lead in harmonizing social and environmental safeguard policies between
the Government and donors. The AsDB also actively participates in the “Six Banks
Initiative,” with Agence Française de Développement (AfD), KfW development bank, Korea
Eximbank, JBIC/JICA and the World Bank, to harmonize project preparation,
implementation, monitoring and evaluation practices and improve the quality and
effectiveness of investment projects.
AsDB and Fund staff work closely together to support the process of economic reforms in
Vietnam. AsDB staff interacts with Fund missions, exchange information, and regularly
consult on policy matters. The resident missions of the two institutions cooperate closely. The
AsDB is taking part in the 2008 Vietnam debt sustainability analysis for the first time, with
the Fund and the World Bank.

ANNEX IV. VIETNAM: STATISTICAL ISSUES
As of January 21, 2009
I. Assessment of Data Adequacy for Surveillance
General: Data provision has some shortcomings, but broadly adequate for surveillance. Most
affected areas are: national accounts, government finance and external sector statistics.
National Accounts: The General Statistics Office (GSO) provides quarterly (cumulative)
and annual data on GDP by type of economic activity and annual data by expenditure (both in
current and constant prices), and monthly and annual data on external trade, industrial output,
retail sales, and prices. The annual constant price GDP estimates have 1994 as the base year
and are in need of updating. While the national accounts methodologies are broadly
consistent with the SNA93, the compilation process suffers from poor data collection
practices and a lack of coordination and communication between data collection agencies.
Prices statistics: The CPI methodology is largely in line with international standards.
However, there is only a notional inclusion of owner-occupied and rental housing. Also, there
is a need to adopt a geometric mean of price relatives at the lower level of aggregation,
instead of the upward biased arithmetic mean. Trade price indices are also compiled, but not
used in the national accounts.
Government finance statistics: Budget classification is broadly consistent with the 1986
GFSM. Government operations data reflect the consolidated operations of the state budget,
which cover all four levels of government (central, provincial, district, and commune).
However, they exclude data on off-budget investment expenditure, quasi-fiscal activities of
state-owned enterprises (SOEs), and extrabudgetary funds, among which are the Social
Security Fund, Enterprise Restructuring Fund, Development Assistance Fund, Export
Support Fund, local development funds, and the Sinking Fund (for repayment of on-lent
funds), for which data are not compiled on a regular basis. Compilation is on a cash basis for
final annual data, but varies for provisional data depending on their source. As a result,
government financing data, in particular domestic bank financing, cannot be reconciled as
reported in the fiscal and monetary accounts. The Bank and the Fund have recommended
improving the coverage of fiscal data.
Monetary statistics: A key shortcoming is insufficient sectorization of bank credit. STA has
encouraged the SBV to develop a reporting scheme for a comprehensive breakdown of
banks’ credit to the economy by borrowing sectors, sub sectors, and ownership of enterprises.
In addition, STA has recommended that: (a) a list of SOEs that have been privatized and
therefore should be classified as private enterprises should be distributed to banks in order to
guide their data reporting on enterprises; (b) funds for on-lending should be reclassified out
of banks’ “unclassified liabilities” to “other deposits.” Further cooperation from the
authorities is needed to resolve data discrepancies involving credit data for a state-owned
bank. These discrepancies may reflect possible noncoverage and/or omission of certain loans
and financial leases, offset by lower deposits and other liabilities.

13

External sector statistics: Monthly and annual trade data have been compiled using customs
reports, but the coverage and accuracy of these data need to be improved. In particular, the
commodity breakdown of a large share of reported exports and imports (approximately
17 percent and 27 percent respectively in 2006) is unknown. Data on invisibles continue to be
based largely on banking records, which provide incomplete coverage and identification of
the types of transactions. Improvements are particularly needed for data on tourism revenue
and workers’ remittances. STA has recommended that the GSO, Ministry of Planning and
Investment, and State Bank of Vietnam work jointly to improve FDI questionnaires and
processes, including collecting data on both stocks and flows. Overlapping responsibility for
debt statistics has at times resulted in some deficiencies in coverage, including the lack of
monitoring certain leasing arrangements (e.g., for aircraft).

Statement by the IMF Staff Representative on Vietnam
March 16, 2009
1.
This statement provides information on economic and policy developments that has
become available since the staff report was circulated to the Executive Board on March 2, 2009.
This information does not alter the thrust of the staff appraisal.
Economic and financial developments
2.
Indicators of economic activity are all pointing to a slowdown. In the first two
months of 2009, industrial production growth slowed to 2½ percent (y/y), with large
contractions in many items including steel, electronics, cars, motorcycles, and footwear.
Retail sales weakened significantly, growing by only 1¼ percent (y/y) in real terms. Tourist
arrivals also declined by 15 percent (y/y). Vietnam’s growth prospects are likely to worsen in
light of these developments and the rapid deterioration in the global environment, although
the fiscal stimulus plan (see below) may help mitigate the downturn.
3.
Inflation continues to decline owing to falling food and fuel prices. Headline
inflation moderated to 14.8 percent (y/y) in February, turning negative on a month-on-month
basis for four months in a row. Core inflation (excluding raw food and energy) also fell to
13.7 percent, and saw the first month-on-month drop (0.2 percent) in nearly six years.
4.
A significant contraction in imports contributed to an improvement in the trade
balance, which recorded a small surplus in the first two months. Exports of goods fell by
5 percent (y/y), notably crude oil, rubber, electronics, and wooden and ceramic products,
while imports contracted by 43 percent, with significant declines in nearly every category.
Exports to traditional markets, such as the United States, European Union, Japan, and
ASEAN have reportedly declined by 20 percent (y/y).
5.
However, this has been offset by a weakening of capital inflows. Portfolio
investment outflows continued, contributing to a further decline in the stock market (by
20 percent year-to-date), and foreign investors have been divesting their remaining bond
holdings. As a result, the dong has continued to trade at the weaker end of the band. In
January, gross international reserves fell by $0.7 billion to $22.3 billion.
Policy developments
6.
Monetary conditions have been relaxed further. While the State Bank of Vietnam
has kept the base rate unchanged at 7 percent since February, the reserve requirement ratio
for dong deposits was reduced further to 3 percent from 5 percent effective March 1. Banks
have started extending loans under the interest rate subsidy scheme which began in early
February, with the bulk of the loans channeled by state-owned commercial banks.

2
7.
The government is expected to submit a revised budget plan for 2009 to the
National Assembly in May. The authorities have started implementing some of the stimulus
measures. Preliminary staff estimates based on limited available information suggest that the
aggregate cost of the stimulus package could be large (4 percent of GDP), but these estimates
are still subject to a significant degree of uncertainty. Moreover, they have not yet been
integrated into a revised budget, and it is not clear to what extent the package might be
financed by reallocation of existing expenditures. Consequently, the total size of the fiscal
stimulus in 2009 and how it will be financed are still not clear. Nevertheless, these estimates
reinforce staff’s concerns about the need for a revised fiscal plan that is consistent with
available financing. In the absence of additional concessional external financing, a sizable
fiscal stimulus could further weaken the external position, crowd out private sector activity,
and undermine fiscal sustainability prospects. With regard to the measures, while measures to
support the poor and the removal of some export duties are welcome, staff is concerned that
other measures are inefficient and not well targeted.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2008 Article IV Consultation
with Vietnam
On March 16, 2009, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded
the Article IV consultation with Vietnam.1
Background
Following an extended period of strong economic performance, Vietnam is facing considerable
challenges. Growth moderated to 6.2 percent in 2008, from a historical average of 7½ percent.
Rapid credit growth fueled by massive capital inflows, coupled with a surge in commodity
prices, led to high inflation and large trade deficits in the first half of 2008. While inflation
pressures are subsiding with easing food and energy prices, growth is expected to slow further
to 4¾ percent in 2009 on the back of weaker domestic and external demand. The current
account deficit is projected to decline to 8 percent of GDP, mainly due to lower imports.
Near-term risks are on the downside, as the deteriorating global environment could worsen
Vietnam’s growth prospects and reduce capital inflows, putting pressure on reserves and the
exchange rate. A slower pace of economic activity could also heighten banks’ vulnerabilities.
Spillover effects from the global turmoil have become more apparent since October 2008.
Exports of goods and services, private remittances, and foreign direct investment have all
weakened. Risk aversion remained acute, prompting foreign investors to continue reducing their
portfolio exposures to Vietnam, particularly in bonds, and the stock market lost two-thirds of its
value in 2008. Depreciation pressures on the dong have also resurfaced.
1

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with members,
usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial information, and discusses
with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On return to headquarters, the staff prepares
a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the
Managing Director, as Chairman of the Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this
summary is transmitted to the country's authorities.

2
Macroeconomic policies have reversed course as concerns over growth increased and inflation
pressures waned. Earlier in 2008, the State Bank of Vietnam (SBV) made considerable efforts
to stabilize the overheating economy. In the fourth quarter, the SBV rapidly eased monetary
policy by lowering its policy rates by 7 percentage points to 7 percent, and reducing reserve
requirements sharply. To alleviate depreciation pressures on the exchange rate, the SBV
devalued the dong and widened the dong-U.S. dollar trading band. However, the dong has
continued to trade at the weaker end of the band. More recently, the government has
announced a broad economic stimulus plan aiming to support growth and protect vulnerable
groups.
Fiscal policy has also become accommodative. With spending stepped up in the final quarter,
the overall fiscal balance in 2008 is estimated to have recorded a deficit of 4¾ percent of GDP.
The original 2009 budget plan (excluding the stimulus plan) indicates a widening of the overall
deficit to about 8¼ percent of GDP with a large domestic financing, reflecting lower revenue
from oil and recent tax reforms and an increase in off-budget expenditure and net lending. The
non-oil primary deficit is projected to rise slightly.
Strains in the banking system emerged in 2008. Banks have high loan-to-deposit ratios and rely
heavily on short-term interbank funding, and their profit margins were squeezed by the higher
funding costs and caps on lending rates. Smaller joint-stock banks were reportedly most
affected, with some obtaining liquidity support from the SBV. Nonperforming loans (NPLs)
doubled to 3 percent in October 2008 from the end-2007 level, and some banks are likely to
face a substantial increase in NPLs with a slowing economy.
Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors commended the Vietnamese authorities for the significant progress they
have made in stabilizing the economy, which was overheating in 2008. Directors welcomed the
recent improvements in inflation and the trade balance. They noted, however, that Vietnam is
facing substantial near-term challenges stemming from the sharp deterioration in global
economic and financial conditions, and that risks are tilted firmly to the downside. Economic
growth is expected to slow in 2009 with capital inflows, exports, and private remittances likely to
decline significantly, while the current account deficit will remain large. Slower growth could also
heighten banking system vulnerabilities. At the same time, Directors agreed that the mediumterm outlook is favorable, with Vietnam remaining an attractive destination for foreign
investment.
Directors considered that an accommodative fiscal stance in 2009 to help mitigate the economic
downturn is appropriate. They cautioned, however, that in the absence of additional
concessional external financing, a large stimulus could further weaken the external position,
crowd out private sector activity, and undermine fiscal sustainability. Most Directors encouraged
the authorities to revise their budget plan for 2009 in the light of these concerns, and with a view
to ensuring that the stimulus measures envisaged are well targeted and effective in supporting
aggregate demand.

3
While welcoming the recent tax reforms, Directors agreed that longer-term revenue and
expenditure reforms will be needed to preserve fiscal sustainability. They called for further
efforts to broaden the tax base. Also, the structure of expenditures should be reviewed to
ensure the efficiency of public investment and the protection of vulnerable groups. Directors
welcomed the initiative to revise the state budget law.
Directors advised the authorities to assess the effects of recent monetary adjustment before
considering easing further. To strengthen the monetary framework, they recommended
improvements in open market operations and liquidity management. Directors took note of the
recent devaluation of the dong and the widening of its exchange rate trading band, and in that
context, they welcomed the authorities’ intention to allow greater exchange rate flexibility,
supported by appropriate macroeconomic policies. They noted the staff’s assessment that the
dong appears somewhat overvalued compared with its estimated medium-term equilibrium
level, although the precise degree of the deviation is difficult to ascertain.
Directors considered that the strengthened capital position and improved provisioning practices
of Vietnamese banks may provide them with a buffer against the impact of the economic
slowdown. Nevertheless, bank loan portfolios could come under pressure as economic growth
slows. Directors encouraged the authorities to develop a more comprehensive contingency plan
to help the banking sector confront the effects of the global financial turmoil. Directors
welcomed the recent efforts to improve bank supervision, but called for further improvement to
ensure that bank vulnerabilities are assessed in a timely and effective manner. They
encouraged the authorities to advance financial sector reform, in particular, strengthening the
operational autonomy of the State Bank of Vietnam.
Directors welcomed the authorities’ intention to press ahead with the reform of state-owned
enterprises (SOEs), while noting that the equitization process has been postponed due partly to
unfavorable market conditions. The planned reforms will help strengthen the performance and
governance of SOEs and sustain Vietnam’s rapid pace of economic development.
Directors welcomed the steps taken to improve data provision, and emphasized that this—along
with an effective public communication strategy—will help bolster investor confidence. They
encouraged the authorities to continue to improve the quality and timeliness of data, especially
in the areas of the fiscal accounts, SOEs, and banking.
Public Information Notices (PINs) form part of the IMF's efforts to promote transparency of the IMF's
views and analysis of economic developments and policies. With the consent of the country
(or countries) concerned, PINs are issued after Executive Board discussions of Article IV consultations
with member countries, of its surveillance of developments at the regional level, of post-program
monitoring, and of ex post assessments of member countries with longer-term program engagements.
PINs are also issued after Executive Board discussions of general policy matters, unless otherwise
decided by the Executive Board in a particular case.

Statement by Perry Warjiyo, Executive Director for Vietnam
and Narayanan Raman, Senior Advisor to Executive Director
March 16, 2009
1.
On behalf of the Vietnamese authorities, we thank Mr. Ishii and his team for their
constructive engagement and candid discussions, which have been usefully crystallized in the
concise set of papers. The authorities found these discussions to be helpful in clarifying their
thinking on a number of key issues. We would like to provide some background on recent
developments and the authorities’ view of the near-term outlook, and the policy options
under consideration. We also wish to highlight the key areas where deeper engagement with
the Fund could be especially helpful.
Recent Developments and Outlook
2.
In the early part of 2008, the Vietnamese authorities faced difficult challenges in
relation to domestic economic management, which have usefully been outlined in the staff
report. While growth remained robust, with GDP increasing by 6½ percent in the first six
months of the year, inflation and the trade deficit both rose significantly, partly as a result of
the worldwide impact of rising food and fuel prices. It should also be noted that part of this
increase is explained by one-off supply shortages arising from unfavourable weather
conditions and plant and livestock disease in the early part of the year. For these reasons,
inflation, which had hitherto been maintained at a relatively comfortable level, rose to over
28 percent during the year. At the same time, the trade deficit in 2008 reached US$18 billion,
resulting in an expansion in the current account deficit.
3.
In response to these developments, the authorities reacted with commendable
swiftness, tightening monetary policy and instituting a more prudent fiscal stance. Directors
will recall that at the time of the staff’s informal briefing to the Board in June 2008, we
outlined the authorities’ 8-point solution package that included deferment or cancellation of a
number of public projects, a tightening of monetary policy, and structural reforms to enhance
overall economic efficiency. Even at that early stage, the measures’ effects were already
being felt and staff have helpfully highlighted that this improvement continues to gain
momentum. Inflation clearly has peaked and will retreat to more comfortable levels by end2009, while the trade deficit is rapidly correcting. The authorities also note that in January
2009, the trade account recorded its first surplus in three years, and expect this improvement
to continue going forward.
4.
The authorities concur with staff that the outlook for 2009 continues to be subject to
great uncertainty. It is clear that global macroeconomic conditions will continue to
deteriorate. As a result of the adverse outlook, the authorities have rightly shifted their focus
from inflation to growth, a view that staff endorse. In general, the authorities concur with the
staff’s assessment of broad agreement on the direction of policy. On monetary policy, the

2
authorities have already taken proactive measures to respond to the crisis. As a result, money
market conditions have remained stable, allowing credit to continue to flow. Going forward,
policy will take into account the steady decline in inflation. In terms of the fiscal stance, the
tighter position in 2008 will be appropriately relaxed in 2009 to help stimulate the economy.
5.
Further, the authorities agree with staff’s assessment that there is a downside risk to
growth. In view of this, Vietnam’s central bank, the State Bank of Vietnam (SBV), has been
instructed to closely monitor and assess the US and global financial markets in order to
identify the impact of the crisis, and to propose solutions to the Prime Minister. The key issue
is one of how best to protect the Vietnamese economy while ensuring that hard won gains on
macroeconomic stability are preserved. Thus, the authorities have introduced and
implemented a number of measures to actively respond to the negative impact of the global
financial crisis and resulting economic slowdown. In particular, the authorities have adopted
a Resolution on emergency measures to counter the economic slowdown, sustain growth and
ensure social safety. The main aims of the package are to:
•

Promote production, business and exports;

•

Stimulate consumption and investment;

•

Implement flexible monetary and financial policies;

•

Ensure social safety; and

•

Ensure the full and well-targeted implementation of these measures.

6.
Having said that, the authorities are well aware that any stimulus, particularly fiscal
stimulus, will need to be financed domestically, given the sense of flux in global markets.
Therefore, the authorities will ensure that any moves to source funding from domestic bond
markets will be done in a sustainable manner. The authorities are also keen to point out that
like many economies in the region, Vietnam has a high savings rate and in this environment,
government bonds remain an attractive asset. The authorities would also like to clarify that
their stimulus plans are not being crafted in response to regional “peer pressure”. It is,
however, true that the stance of regional peers provides additional information regarding the
cyclical position of the regional and global economies. Further, the sizes of the various
responses provides a useful cross-check to the authorities’ own planned response.
7.
The authorities agree with staff’s recommendation to enhance communication. In
fact, communication and the provision of data has received great attention and the authorities
have made considerable progress. Important data on macroeconomics, financial, banking,
business etc. have been provided in a more timely and comprehensive manner, thereby
enhancing investor’s confidence.
8.
The authorities fully agree with staff that the medium-term outlook for Vietnam
remains positive. Continuing inflows of foreign direct investment in these difficult times

3
indicates that global investors share this assessment as well. Since the beginning of the
year, the authorities licensed 67 projects with a total investment value of US$1.5 billion.
External Stability
9.
The SBV reiterated its goal to allow significantly greater flexibility to the dong over
the medium term, and fully agree with staff’s assessment that greater flexibility would be
appropriate with the increasing sophistication of the Vietnamese economy. However, this
transition is being pursued with appropriately prudent steps in order to avoid any negative
impact on Vietnam’s economy and external position. In the DSA, staff have clearly shown
that the balance sheet effects of a large dong depreciation could be significant. Further, too
significant a depreciation could reverse the process of de-dollarization, thereby rendering
monetary policy less effective. Having said that, the authorities can confirm that the candid
discussions with the staff on the options available were particularly helpful. They intend to
look at all options, including adjusting the trading band and keeping a close eye on the
central rate during this process. The authorities also point out that following the steps taken
on the exchange rate in 2008, the dong’s value in the parallel market, which had diverged
from the official rate, closed significantly to within 2 percent.
10.
The authorities also note that while it has risen, the current account deficit remains
fully funded by stable long-term flows including concessional financing, ODA and foreign
direct investment. They also note that should some of these flows decline, there will be an
automatic correction in the current account due to lower capital and intermediate imports.
Further, the deep pool of domestic savings has meant that the exit of foreign portfolio
investors was covered by local investors. Foreign portfolio investors have mostly exited the
Vietnamese market and further outflows present a negligible risk. The reserves position
remains relatively ample at over US$22 billion, allowing the SBV to ensure the foreign
exchange market continues to function.
11.
The authorities agree with the primary conclusions of the DSA exercise, particularly
that Vietnam remains at low risk of distress. As staff have rightly pointed out, Vietnam’s
debt position has historically been robust, which is the product of a very prudent debt
management strategy. The authorities intend to maintain this strategy, carefully calibrating
the level of debt to the capacity of the economy to bear the risks. Public debt, in particular,
has risen in recent years but the authorities stress that part of this has been related to meeting
pressing infrastructure needs. Addressing these needs could enhance economic efficiency,
thereby raising overall growth levels. The authorities believe that by strong growth, the debt
position will become even sounder going forward. Further, a part of the outlays were to put
state-owned enterprises on a sounder footing, and will be recouped when privatization
(equitization) takes place. The bigger challenge will be the gradual loss of access to
concessional resources in the transition to being a full-fledged emerging market economy.

Financial Sector Stability and Policies
12.
The authorities found the staff’s analysis of financial sector stability to be balanced
and well researched. They agreed with many of the key findings, most notably that
Vietnamese banks remain in a strong position. Capital levels have been raised, nonperforming loans remain low and provisioning practices improved. As at end-2008, equity
capital in the banking system increased by 30 percent compared with the level a year earlier,
while the capital adequacy ratio improved from 8.9 percent to 9.7 percent over the same
period. Further, the very conservative valuation practices, coupled with equally prudent
levels of financing, mean that loans given out cover between 35-50 percent of the assessed
value of any asset. This has kept NPLs from rising significantly and provides banks with
significant protection against credit risks arising from changes in valuations. While the NPL
ratio increased to 2.1 percent at the end of 2008 compared to 1.5 percent as at end- 2007, the
authorities note that this is still a very low level and well within control.
13.
Nevertheless, the SBV has taken proactive steps to ensure that emerging risks are
minimized. These include:
•

•

•
•

Requiring commercial banks to review all their deposits and investments in foreign
banks and financial institutions in order to have contingency plans to reallocate these
deposits to safer institutions and those less affected by the crisis;
Requiring commercial banks to review and check all their investment lending,
particularly their exposure to high risk sectors such as real estate and purchase of
securities, and to strengthen supervisory and prudential measures on these loans.
Exercising greater oversight over these risky loans, as well as reviewing and
monitoring bank capital levels; and
Strengthening the bank resolution framework, including completing the development
of regulations on debt factoring, setting up vehicles to deal with impaired assets of
commercial banks, and preparing and submitting regulations on dealing with problem
banks to the Prime Minister. These actions will provide the legal basis for the
restructuring of weaker banks and credit institutions, thus ensuring the safety and
soundness of the banking system.

14.
The authorities expect that the financial sector will continue to exhibit strong growth
over the medium term. The staff report clearly highlights the still-significant portion of the
population that does not yet have access to the banking system. Therefore, this strong growth
should be seen as a form of convergence as the country modernizes. In a financial system at
Vietnam’s level of development, the authorities believe that the first and best line of defense
against risks is capital, which is why they have placed such great emphasis on raising
capitalization levels. Having said that, the authorities are well aware of the need to remove
institutional roadblocks to greater effectiveness. In this connection, the work being

5
undertaken on the SBV Law and the Credit and Financial Institutions Law is the cornerstone
of the efforts to overhaul and modernize Vietnam’s regulatory and supervisory framework.
The authorities are grateful to the work being undertaken by MCM in providing them
feedback on their proposals. The authorities also appreciate the Fund’s assistance in many
other areas of financial sector management, including crisis management.
Structural Reforms
15.
The authorities continue to implement structural reforms on a number of fronts,
spurred by the historic economic transition Vietnam is making as well as in anticipation of
full implementation of WTO commitments.
16.
On the fiscal front, there is strong impetus to enact and implement the new State
Budget Law, which will go to the National Assembly later this year. The Law will improve
the relationship between the central and provincial authorities, lay out a clear basis for
reporting revenues and expenditures, thereby improving execution of fiscal measures and
transparency and timeliness of reporting. In addition, the authorities have embarked on a
pilot multi-year rolling budgeting framework for six ministries and three local authorities.
The results so far have been positive and the authorities hope to expand the program.
17.
The authorities also concur with staff with the need to prepare for the loss of tariff
revenues and forestall over-dependence on oil revenues. To this end, the authorities are
considering a number initiatives, including setting up a large taxpayers unit and examining
the role of taxes on assets. Indirect taxes will also form an important part of future reforms.
On the expenditure side, the authorities feel there is a need to balance fiscal sustainability
with the pressing needs of a rapidly growing economy. This balance has led to a careful
examination of public-private partnerships. Having said this, any recourse to PPP
arrangements will be done carefully and prudently, following a period of careful design and
testing of modalities. Staff’s reminder of the potential risks was very useful in this regard.
18.
On monetary policy, the authorities are preparing significant legislative changes that
will enshrine the responsibilities and authority of the SBV. In particular, the SBV Law will
clarify many of the important roles the SBV will need to play in a fast modernizing economy.
They expect to bring a revised draft of the law to the National Assembly shortly.
19.
On the financial sector, the authorities will continue to press for better provisioning
and risk reporting standards. Staff rightly point out that reporting requirements were
tightened significantly with the introduction of the new loan categories. The SBV is also
significantly strengthening its supervisory capacity by intensifying both on-site and off-site
monitoring. As we noted earlier, the regulators are also working closely with the fiscal
authorities to ensure that the crisis resolution framework can meet potential demands. In this

6
regard, the authorities were satisfied with the framework’s robustness in dealing with the
market disruptions experienced last May.
The Role of the Fund
20.
Unsurprisingly, the key to improved policy formulation and implementation is
capacity. The authorities have made key strides in upgrading their capabilities but
shortcomings remain. In this regard, the important role played by the Fund, both by staff at
headquarters and the Resident Representative’s office in Hanoi, cannot be underplayed. It is
also worth pointing out that the authorities’ have requested assistance from the Fund
precisely in the areas where surveillance has highlighted room for improvement. This is a
testament that the staff’s advice is being taken seriously. It should be noted that in areas such
as financial stability, statistical improvements and the fiscal framework, the staff have taken
the lead role. In particular, there have been a number of missions during this past year by
MCM staff to look at crisis management and resolution frameworks. Work is also being
undertaken at HQ to provide feedback on the legislative reforms proposed by SBV to
enhance regulatory and supervisory capacity. The authorities hope that the Fund will
continue to provide assistance going forward.
