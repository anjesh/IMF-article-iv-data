INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND
UNITED KINGDOM
Staff Report for 2010 Article IV Consultation
Prepared by Staff Representatives for the 2010 Consultation with the United Kingdom
Approved by Ajai Chopra and Tamim Bayoumi
October 21, 2010
Overview: The UK economy is on the mend. Economic recovery is underway, unemployment
has stabilized, and financial sector health has improved. The challenge now is to support a
balanced and sustainable recovery. The government’s forceful multi-year fiscal deficit reduction
plan will promote such rebalancing and is essential to ensure debt sustainability, thereby greatly
reducing the risk of a costly loss of confidence in public finances. Fiscal tightening will dampen
but not stop growth as other sectors of the economy emerge as drivers of recovery, supported by
continued monetary stimulus. Upside and downside risks around this central scenario of
rebalancing with moderate growth and gradually falling inflation are symmetric. Monetary
policy will need to be nimble if risks materialize, and fiscal automatic stabilizers should operate
freely. Meanwhile, the UK authorities should continue to provide leadership and build support
for ambitious global reform of financial regulation. Ensuring a smooth transition to a new
supervisory architecture at home will also be important to secure a safer post-crisis environment.
The 2010 Article IV discussions were held in London during September 15–27, 2010. The
team comprised Mr. Chopra (head), Messrs. Fletcher, Meier, and Takizawa, Ms. Barkbu (all
EUR), Ms. Le Leslé (MCM), and Mr. Moore (MCM). Ms. Ruiz Arranz (EUR) contributed to
the mission’s work from headquarters.
The mission met with Chancellor Osborne, Bank of England Governor King, Financial Services
Authority Chairman Turner, and other senior officials, academics, think tanks, and private sector
representatives. Mr. Gibbs (Executive Director) and Ms. Fisher (Advisor, OED) joined selected
meetings.
The mission’s concluding statement was published on September 27, 2010 and can be
found at: http://www.imf.org/external/np/ms/2010/092710.htm
Past surveillance: During the 2009 Article IV Consultation, Directors commended the
authorities’ response to the financial crisis, but highlighted the significant vulnerabilities related
to sharply rising public debt and continued financial sector fragility. The authorities’ June 2010
budget lays out a concrete multi-year plan to reverse the deterioration of the public finances and
put debt on a firmly downward path, as recommended by Directors. Supporting this process, the
creation of the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) also matches past IMF advice calling for
independent provision of budget assumptions. The health of the financial system has improved
over the last year, though further progress is necessary in this area.

I. THE ECONOMIC AGENDA
1.
The new Conservative-Liberal Democrat coalition government has launched a
number of important policy initiatives in its first few months in office. Its first budget,
released in June, lays out an ambitious multi-year plan for deficit reduction—the centerpiece
of the coalition agreement. To underscore its commitment, the government has created an
independent Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR), which produces macroeconomic and
fiscal forecasts for the budget and assesses whether budget plans are adequate to meet
government-set fiscal targets. Separately, the government has set out to revamp the UK’s
framework for financial regulation and supervision, consolidating key responsibilities in the
Bank of England (BoE).
2.
These initiatives come in response to significant challenges, as the policy focus
shifts from immediate fire-fighting to post-crisis repair. With crisis memories still fresh
and lingering risks, the priority is to preserve confidence. To this end, the authorities going
forward will need to implement announced plans to restore fiscal sustainability and maintain
monetary stimulus to ensure a smooth rebalancing of the economy, while laying the
groundwork for a safer financial system.


Recovery from the financial crisis is underway, despite continued headwinds
(Figure 1). After six quarters of deep recession, the economy started growing again in
late 2009, led by a classic turn in the inventory cycle. More recently, final private
demand has also rebounded from low levels (Figure 2), causing GDP growth to
surprise on the upside. The recovery has been buttressed by the authorities’ forceful
policy response, including large-scale interventions to rescue the financial system,
temporary fiscal stimulus (though this started phasing out in 2010) along with full
operation of automatic stabilizers, and unprecedented monetary easing. However,
sterling depreciation has not yet boosted net exports as much as expected, and signs
of a softening global recovery have dampened the outlook for external demand.
Domestically, still-strained household and bank balance sheets remain a headwind for
growth. Meanwhile, inflation has surprised on the upside as a series of price level
shocks has more than offset the moderating effect of sizeable economic slack.



The challenge going forward will be to ensure sustainable recovery and balance
sheet repair while remaining flexible to respond to shocks. In staff’s central
scenario, fiscal consolidation will mend the fiscal position while stimulative monetary
policy continues to support private and external sector-led growth. However, there is
significant uncertainty surrounding the underlying recovery momentum in the UK
and globally. The operation of automatic fiscal stabilizers provides an important
safeguard against risks on both sides. Moreover, monetary policy can flexibly
increase—via more quantitative easing—or withdraw stimulus so as to deal with a
broad range of shocks. Financial sector policies, in turn, face the difficult task of
moving to a stronger financial system while ensuring adequate credit supply during
the transition.

II. PROGRESS IN REBALANCING AND DELEVERAGING
3.
Continued economic recovery depends on a sustainable revival of private
spending, while the public sector retrenches. The UK economy entered the crisis with a
number of pent-up imbalances: overheated property markets, low household saving, high
private sector debt, a large and overleveraged
8

Sources: Haver; and IMF staff calculations.
Households are likely to remain thriftier than
before the crisis, but have room to gradually raise consumption as labor market concerns
subside and saving rates settle somewhat below their recent peak. The corporate sector, in
turn, is projected to lessen its cash preservation effort, as the demand outlook firms up and
credit constraints continue to ease. Improved net exports should simultaneously stabilize the
external balance around a lower and sustainable deficit. Overall, this gradual rebalancing of
the economy is projected to allow moderate growth, with considerable risks on both sides.
A. Sectoral Adjustments and Evolution of Financial Balances
4.
The deleveraging of household balance sheets was a key feature of the
downturn, but has recently begun to ease. Private consumption declined considerably
during the recession, as households responded to mounting economic uncertainty and
plunging asset prices (Figure 3). Lower net tax payments cushioned the loss in labor income,
but the gross household saving rate surged to a peak of 7¾ percent in mid-2009—up six
percentage points from its pre-crisis levels. This shift to frugality mimics developments
during historical financial crises elsewhere and is likely to have at least some permanent
component. Indeed, compared to the UK’s OECD peers, household saving rates are still low
and debt levels high, reflecting widespread home ownership and high house price levels.
Nonetheless, the saving rate already fell back to 4½ percent in the first half of 2010, as
recovering asset prices and a stabilizing labor market lifted confidence. At the same time,
record-low interest rates significantly reduced debt service costs.

7
Figure 3. Financial Position of Households
Meanwhile, the recovery of asset prices has bolstered
household net worth, while gross debt has fallen.

Households have suffered a drop in labor income, but a
lower net tax burden has shielded disposable income.

The labor market has proven more resilient than expected. Although any
significant increase in unemployment entails hefty human costs, employment losses have
been relatively moderate compared to previous recessions (Figure 4). Unemployment
initially rose from 5½ percent to 8 percent, but then stabilized at this level for most of the
past year and has edged down slightly in recent months. This resilience partly reflects lower
net immigration, reduced labor force participation, and some public sector hiring. However,
the data also suggest some labor hoarding in the private sector, induced by wage restraint,
firms’ desire to retain talent, and expectations of a recovery in demand.1 Business surveys
continue to show slack in the labor market and generally little difficulty in recruiting staff,
especially in services.

Residential property prices have recovered but remain below pre-crisis levels.
House prices staged a faster-than-expected recovery in 2009, as financially strong buyers
returned to a market still characterized by relatively limited supply (Figure 5). More recently,
the upward momentum has dissipated, with the 3-month change in house prices turning
negative. Overall, prices remain some 15 percent below their 2007 peak. At this level,
valuations continue to appear stretched relative to income, although exceptionally low
interest rates have boosted affordability, at least for now. Meanwhile, overall financing
conditions are still tight, with average loan-to-value ratios on new first mortgages hovering at
75-80 percent, well below the ratios observed during the pre-crisis boom. Mortgage
approvals and net lending amounts have also stayed at low levels. On the positive side,
mortgage arrears and repossessions have eased from their (already moderate) peak rates.

market remains limited even today. This
situation has supported relatively high house prices, benefiting older, home-owning
generations at the expense of younger households and driving up gross household
indebtedness. Wide-spread affordability problems have also given rise to high public outlays
for housing support—more than 1 percent of GDP in 2009/10—and reduced labor mobility.

Businesses reined in spending during the crisis, but have recently shown signs
of reviving investment activity. The nonfinancial corporate sector entered the recession
with relatively solid financial balances, despite high debt levels. As demand contracted and
the profit outlook deteriorated, firms cut back sharply on investment to preserve cash flow.
From these unsustainably low levels, investment rebounded 13 percent (saar) in the first half
of 2010. Recent surveys of investment intentions and falling spare capacity in manufacturing
point to continued expansion going forward. Defaults on bank loans and company
liquidations have increased from low levels since 2008, but appear to have peaked in 2009.
Overall, the financial position of companies remains resilient, but there are areas of
vulnerability, especially in commercial real estate, where prices are hovering one-third below
pre-crisis levels.

Despite significant sterling depreciation, net export volumes have yet to pick
up significantly. Sterling’s real effective exchange rate declined some 25 percent between
mid-2007 and early 2009 and has since stabilized around this new level. Based on standard
IMF methodologies, the currency appears to be broadly in line with fundamentals. However,
the weaker exchange rate has not yet boosted net export volumes as much as expected.
Instead, most of the depreciation has so far translated into stronger profit margins for
exporters (Figure 7). Consequently, the current account deficit in 2010 is on track to be only
slightly below the pre-crisis level of 2½ percent of GDP. Meanwhile, the depreciated
exchange rate did improve the UK’s international investment position, as UK external assets
have a greater foreign-currency component than external liabilities. However, the IIP has
weakened somewhat in recent quarters on the back of higher asset valuations in the UK.

UK Banks have made progress in
repairing their balance sheets (see Figure 8
and companion Selected Issues paper for
additional details on recent developments). All
major banks have raised capital and reduced
leverage. Moderate impairment charges, wider
lending margins, and higher investment banking
revenue have boosted system-wide earnings over
the last year, and the two large, part-nationalized
banks have returned to profit. The July 2010
EU-wide stress tests and associated disclosure
confirmed the improved health of UK banks.

deposit funding. Their dependence on volatile short-term funding sources has simultaneously
diminished somewhat.

Nonetheless, challenges remain. UK banks will need to rollover or replace large
amounts of wholesale funding coming due over the next few years, including funds received
through government support schemes that are being phased out. At the same time,
uncertainty about the sustainability of bank profits and the quality of bank assets remains
significant. Notable risks include the commercial real estate portfolios of some banks. A

large share of loans is due to be refinanced
in the next few years, and default rates
could increase. Another source of risks is
consumer credit, which could cause higher
losses if unemployment were to rise
beyond current rates. Faced with such
uncertainties and the prospect of tighter
regulatory standards, banks have generally
stayed cautious about extending new
credit.

III. PROSPECTS, RISKS, AND SPILLOVERS
16.
The central scenario envisages economic recovery to continue at a moderate
pace, as private and external demand progressively gather strength. Recent short-term
indicators point to solid activity in the third quarter, even though a repeat of the strong
second-quarter performance is unlikely. Inventory dynamics and a pick-up in fixed business
investment are expected to remain the near-term drivers of growth. Order receipts also
foreshadow higher exports, although the overall growth contribution from net trade is likely
to be modest. Meanwhile, private consumption and residential investment are likely to be
dampened by low real income growth, looming tax hikes, and still-strained balance sheets,
but should strengthen gradually as labor market conditions improve. In this scenario, the
household saving rate is projected to stabilize below its recent peak, but remain above precrisis levels. Taken together, the progressive strengthening of private and external demand
would underpin a moderate-paced recovery, even as the public sector retrenches. Annual
growth is projected at 1.7 percent this year and 2 percent in 2011.
17.
Risks around this forecast are unusually large, though broadly balanced.
Staff’s central projection reflects a range of factors, whose precise quantitative effects on
growth are difficult to pin down. On the one hand, very low real interest rates, the past
depreciation of sterling, and the ongoing recovery of global demand could give a greater
boost to UK growth momentum. Indeed, the sharp drop in GDP during the crisis might
suggest that the ensuing rebound should also be stronger than historical recoveries, not
slightly weaker as projected by staff. On the other hand, the possibilities of further rapid
deleveraging among households and banks, a sharp new downturn in the housing market, and
greater-than-expected weakness in parts of the euro area constitute important downside risks
to growth. Finally, the precise headwinds from fiscal consolidation are difficult to predict—
they could turn out more powerful than expected or more modest as during the 1990s
consolidation (see text chart). Overall, risks around the central forecast appear substantial,
but broadly balanced. A particularly consequential, if unlikely, scenario would see major new
shocks—arising from either external or domestic forces—derail confidence and thrust the
There are also upside risks to staff's growth forecasts, as
the projected recovery would be slower than historical
precedents...

UK economy into another extended recession. In this case, companies might begin large layoffs of staff they have retained so far, prompting a step increase in unemployment with
highly adverse macro-financial feedback effects.
18.
A key underlying vulnerability relates to spillovers from external financial
market shocks, given the global reach and connectedness of the UK financial sector.
UK-owned banks have consolidated foreign assets exceeding 180 percent of GDP, despite
some retrenchment over the last two years (Figure 10). Exposures are sizeable vis-à-vis the
United States, where the commercial real estate sector remains an area of particular concern,
and a number of advanced economies in Asia and Western Europe, including those EU
members currently in the spotlight of financial markets. Specifically, claims on Greece,
Ireland, Portugal, and Spain account for about 14 percent of GDP—a similar proportion as
for French and German banks, although UK bank claims are more strongly concentrated on
Ireland. Negative shocks in any of these markets could necessitate further write-downs and
weaken UK banks’ capacity to support the domestic economic recovery with adequate credit
supply. Additional spillovers could arise from the important role that foreign banks play in
the UK, mostly via London’s wholesale financial services industry, but also in retail finance.
Indeed, the tightening of credit supply since the beginning of the crisis partly owes to the
sharp retrenchment of lending by some foreign banks. A simple VAR analysis confirms that
global financial shocks have significant effects on the UK economy (Box 1).
19.
Looking further ahead, there are also key uncertainties about the UK’s
medium-term growth potential. In staff’s assessment, the financial crisis has not only
depressed aggregate demand, but also dented potential supply. As a result, spare capacity is
far more limited than the drop in GDP would

some lasting impact from the crisis, as
potential growth is weighed down by higher
risk premia, skill losses due to longer-term unemployment, and, perhaps, some permanent
shift of demand away from sectors that enjoyed high productivity growth.

22
Box 1. Inward Spillovers to the UK
Like most other major European countries, the UK has important financial sector links
to stressed markets, such as the euro area periphery (Figure 10).4 UK banks’ consolidated
claims on EA-4 countries (Greece, Ireland, Portugal, Spain) stand at about 14 percent of UK
GDP. UK banks are also indirectly exposed to the EA-4, for example through claims on
French and German banks (around 8 percent of GDP), which in turn have significant exposure
to EA-4 countries. Separately, Ireland-owned banks operating in the UK account for 7 percent
of domestic corporate loans and 3 percent of household loans. Further financial stress in the
EA-4 countries could thus have noticeable effects on the UK economy.
The UK’s position as a global financial center is another important international
spillover channel. A significant downturn in global financial markets—irrespective of the
specific origin or trigger—could weaken UK banks’ capital base through reduced revenue
from trading and investment banking activities, mark-to-market losses on financial assets, and
possibly higher funding costs.
A structural VAR analysis points to large spillovers from shocks to global growth and
financial market conditions to the UK economy. The VAR model comprises the following
variables: UK real GDP, a weighted average of real GDP for countries to which UK banks
have large exposures, a weighted average of the TED spread for the same countries, and the
TED spread for the UK. The following identifying assumptions are imposed: UK variables do
not affect variables for other countries; variables for other countries have contemporaneous
effects on UK variables; and, within each “block” (i.e., a block of UK variables or other
countries’ variables), real GDP has a contemporaneous effect on the TED spread, but not viceversa. The analysis suggests that a structural shock that causes an average 100 basis-point
increase in the foreign TED spread results in a 0.4 percentage point decline in the UK’s real
GDP growth on impact, with the effect widening to 1.2 percentage points over the following
two quarters before tapering off. The estimated effect of a structural shock on other countries’
GDP is also sizeable: a 1 percentage point decline in other countries’ real GDP results in
about a 0.8 percentage point decline in the UK’s real GDP on impact, and the effect persists
for several quarters. Although the model is somewhat mechanical and does not capture all
variables and salient features of cross-border spillovers, the analysis suggests significant
inward spillovers to the UK economy.

Against this backdrop, growth is projected to rise gradually to 2½ percent in
the medium term, only slowly closing the output gap. This projection, and the risks around
it, reflect many of the same factors that also impinge on the near-term outlook:


In general, fiscal consolidation could over time have more favorable growth effects,
notably if consolidation boosts national saving or if a shift in activity from the public
to the private sector raises productivity. However, to the extent that fiscal
retrenchment weakens aggregate demand over a period that is more extended than
envisaged in the central scenario, the resulting resource slack could also lead to some
further scrapping of idle capital and persistent unemployment, reducing both actual
and potential output.



The ultimate growth effect of a weaker exchange rate is equally uncertain. Staff
expects domestic firms to gradually shift more production toward export and importcompeting sectors in order to benefit from improved competitiveness. Yet, it is also
possible that net exports prove to be relatively price-inelastic. In addition, global
demand might have shifted away from some of the products and services in which the
UK specializes. Compounding this uncertainty, there is a risk that sterling might
rebound in the period ahead, as credible fiscal consolidation boosts confidence and
strengthens the relative attractiveness of UK assets.



Lastly, there is considerable uncertainty over the future supply and price of credit to
businesses, given the extent of regulatory and financial pressures bearing on banks.
Although weak net lending may not hurt the recovery at an early stage, financing
constraints could become more onerous as demand picks up over the medium run.5

Authorities’ views
21.
The authorities’ envisaged somewhat higher growth than projected by staff.
There was essentially no difference in the outlook for 2010 (the OBR’s lower growth forecast
in the June budget was made before the strong Q2 outturn was released), but both the OBR
and BoE projected somewhat stronger growth than staff in 2011 and the medium term (text
chart and Table 2). The authorities’ stronger growth projections are underpinned by:


5

a larger contribution from net exports, driven by a stronger supply-side response to
past sterling depreciation; the authorities viewed the weak contribution from net
exports so far as partly reflecting temporary factors, such as high imports due to car
scrappage schemes and restocking; and

In a forthcoming IMF working paper on “Creditless Recoveries,” Abiad et al. find that recoveries with low or
no credit growth are common after recessions linked to a banking crisis. However, growth in such recoveries is
on average much lower than growth in recoveries with “normal” credit growth.

of their policy efforts will be amplified if
they are complemented by coordinated multilateral action to rebalance global demand toward
more sustainable external positions across countries and to strengthen financial regulation.

IV. ENSURING FISCAL SUSTAINABILITY
22.
The June budget sets out an ambitious and comprehensive medium-term fiscal
consolidation plan. The government has set itself a fiscal mandate to balance the cyclicallyadjusted current budget by the end of a five-year rolling horizon––currently by 2015/16––and
put the net debt-to-GDP ratio on a declining 3

is relatively frontloaded, with discretionary

23.
Although this consolidation effort involves painful decisions and dampens shortrun growth, it is necessary to enhance credibility and ensure fiscal sustainability. The
government has rightly emphasized the priority of ensuring debt sustainability to avoid the
tail risk of a very costly loss of confidence in the sovereign and to regain fiscal space to cope
with future adverse shocks and demographic-related spending pressures (Box 2). Under the
announced policy plans, it should be feasible to lower the debt-to-GDP ratio to 60 percent by

27
Box 2. To Tighten, or Not to Tighten—UK Fiscal Policy in the Public Debate
Despite consensus on the need for medium-term fiscal consolidation, a debate has emerged
over the appropriate timing of UK budget cuts. Pre-election policy proposals by all major parties
agreed on the priority of deficit reduction. Indeed, the March 2010 budget of the previous
government and the June 2010 budget of the new coalition both feature significant fiscal tightening
from 2010 onward—differences in the envisaged fiscal effort do not exceed ½ percent of GDP in
any year. Nonetheless, the right timing of consolidation has become the subject of a controversial
debate, reflecting different views about the economic outlook and key risks.
Critics of immediate fiscal tightening have stressed the risk of choking off a still-fragile
recovery. The main arguments are as follows: 6
 There is no guarantee that other sectors will continue expanding while the government
retrenches. Additional monetary stimulus may not be powerful enough to offset this risk.
 Beyond the adverse effect on demand, excessive tightening may even destroy supply capacity. In
this view, a bleak assessment of the UK’s structural deficit could be self-fulfilling: because
policymakers assume a large permanent drop in potential output, they tighten policies too early;
this causes capital scrapping and human capital losses that a faster recovery would help prevent.
 The need to placate bond markets is overstated. Long-term UK interest rates show no sign of
market panic, and commitments to future fiscal consolidation are more important than
immediate cuts. In this context, tying consolidation plans to the political cycle imposes
unnecessary pain: “A parliamentary term is a political reality, not an economic one.”
Many of these points have merit, but there are strong counterarguments as well:
 Although fiscal tightening has already started, there are signs of economic recovery led by the
private sector. Indeed, the consensus forecast is for solid growth next year, partly reflecting
natural cyclical momentum. Moreover, the combination with very loose monetary policy should
support the necessary rebalancing of demand, including through higher net exports.
 Spare capacity is notoriously difficult to assess in real time, but the available evidence points to
an output gap not far from the estimate underlying the June budget. And while there is a risk to
underestimating potential, there is also the opposite risk—of belatedly discovering higher-thanexpected structural deficits and greater inflationary pressure. Furthermore, experience from
historical financial crises consistently points to a lasting and large drop in potential GDP. Is this
time really different?
 A glance at current bond yields does not do justice to the risk of a sovereign funding crisis—a
low-probability, but very-high-impact scenario for the UK. To begin with, gilt yields have been
depressed by large-scale BoE purchases (see Box 3). More importantly, market assessments can
change quickly, as witnessed by the surge in borrowing costs in some Eurozone countries.
Indeed, UK spreads also rose in the first few months of this year, but started moving the other
way in May/June, not least in response to the budget announcements (chart, p. 32).
 In this context, the critics downplay the importance of political credibility: promises of future
consolidation alone are unlikely to be persuasive, especially once they reach beyond the current
term of parliament. The novelty of a coalition government may further heighten this concern.
After weighing these different arguments and assessing the outlook and risks, staff’s view is that a
significant fiscal tightening with frontloading in 2011/12 is appropriate to secure confidence in the
UK’s debt sustainability. However, the uncertainty surrounding the current cyclical outlook puts a
premium on contingency planning. Thus, the authorities need to be prepared to tackle surprises on
either side of their central forecast.

See, for example, a series of columns in the Financial Times: “The risk of Osborne’s pre-emptive strike,” June 24,
2010; “Why the Balls critique is correct,” September 2, 2010; or “The IMF’s foolish praise for austerity,” September
30, 2010.

28
2025, whereas returning to pre-crisis debt levels (40 percent of GDP) would require
additional fiscal effort after 2015 (see the debt sustainability analysis in Annex A for a
discussion of the required fiscal adjustment to lower the debt-to-GDP ratio). As such, the
consolidation plan should help meet the government’s central objectives of preserving
confidence in the UK’s public finances and promoting a gradual rebalancing of the economy
away from excessive public deficits toward private sector-led growth. In this context, the
decision to frontload the adjustment has helped further dispel market concerns, especially
against the backdrop of heightened fiscal stress in parts of the euro area. Decisive policy
implementation will contribute to keep a favorable financing environment with low risk
premia and might help to mitigate the effects of fiscal tightening on growth.
24.
The budget contains an appropriate mix of concrete spending and revenue
measures, lending credibility to the government’s consolidation plan. Although the brunt
of the adjustment comes from reductions in public expenditure, the budget also programs
several tax measures, including a rise in the standard VAT rate from 17½ percent to
20 percent from January 2011, a hike in

25.
The October Spending Review provides an opportunity to strengthen the
composition of adjustment. Total managed expenditure (TME) is set to decline by 7.7
percentage points of GDP over the next six years to 2015/16. Despite announced reductions
in social benefits, annual managed expenditure (AME; the nondiscretionary component of
spending) will contribute just 0.1 percentage points to the adjustment, as debt interest
payments are projected to rise. The bulk of the adjustment falls, therefore, on departmental
expenditure limits (DEL; the discretionary component). All government functions, except for
health and foreign aid, are projected to face real cuts of 25 percent on average over the next
four years. Public investment would be especially affected, falling by one-third in real terms.
Implementation of such cuts could prove challenging. Against this background, staff
recommends putting greater emphasis on reducing public sector compensation premia and
achieving savings in benefits and transfers through better targeting.7 This would help avoid
an excessive squeeze on investment and other non-protected government functions, help
mitigate the growth effects of adjustment (because reducing transfers to the less needy may
have a smaller effect on consumption), and help shield the vulnerable.

The authorities’ fiscal consolidation strategy may be tested in the event risks
to growth materialize. Under staff’s central scenario, fiscal tightening is expected to
dampen growth, though without stopping the ongoing recovery. This view is consistent with
the OBR’s assumption of positive, but moderate, fiscal multipliers and the frontloading of

The Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) estimates that the average premium of public sector wages over private
sector wages is around 5 percent. However, this estimate excludes the effect of relatively more generous

nonwage benefits. The premium varies significantly across different regions and skill levels.

the economy—supporting growth if downside risks materialize and supporting disinflation if
upside risks materialize. In the unexpected but possible case of a significant and prolonged
downturn, alongside further support from monetary policy, temporary tax cuts should also be
considered. Such tax cuts are faster to implement and more credibly temporary than
expenditure shifts and should be targeted to low-income households, employment creation,
or investment to increase their multipliers. Simultaneous adoption of entitlement reforms (see
below) would be desirable to safeguard fiscal sustainability and market credibility.

Entitlement reforms to address long-term fiscal challenges should be pursued.
Although the UK’s demographic outlook compares favorably with that of other advanced
economies, staff estimates that age-related spending will increase by about 4 percentage
points of GDP over the next 20 years under current policies. More than three quarters of this
increase is due to higher health and long-term care spending, which highlights the importance
of healthcare cost containment and efficiency reforms. On pensions, measures to reduce costs

31
include accelerating the planned increases in the statutory retirement age for state pensions
and gradually aligning the generosity of public pensions with their counterparts in the private
sector.8 These reforms would have at most a minor immediate impact on aggregate demand,
but would have long-term effects on fiscal sustainability, thus bolstering the credibility gains
of the government’s adjustment package. The initiatives launched by the government to
review reform options for state and public sector pensions are therefore welcome.
28.
The establishment of a new independent Office for Budget Responsibility is a
welcome step toward strengthening the budget process. Tasks envisaged for the OBR
include to provide the macroeconomic and fiscal forecasts for the budget and to assess fiscal
sustainability and compliance with the fiscal mandate. The June budget was, for the first
time, based on such independent forecasts issued by the interim OBR. The new office should
help enhance the transparency and credibility of the budget process and better inform policy
decisions (though unbiased forecasts do not by themselves ensure fiscal discipline). As the
role and remit of the permanent OBR are finalized, it will be important to incorporate lessons
from international best practice. Specifically, the OBR must be fully independent and
perceived to be so. To this end, it will be important to ensure an arms-length relationship
with Treasury, full-access rights to pertinent information, multi-year budgets, adequate
staffing, and a sufficiently broad remit to allow the OBR to achieve its objectives.
29.
The UK’s fiscal institutions would further benefit from the eventual adoption
of a new rule-based framework. Although the current fiscal mandate is appropriate to guide
the consolidation process, in due course it should be replaced with more permanent fiscal
rules. The credibility of a fiscal rule would be supported by input from the OBR. Fiscal rules,
such as a structural balance rule or a rule that responds to deviations in output growth relative
to trend growth, rather than changes in the output gap, could work well in the UK (see
companion Selected Issues paper). Notably, such rules would anchor medium-term debt
sustainability, provide clear operational guidance for fiscal policy, ensure transparency and
ease of monitoring, and promote countercyclical policies.
Authorities’ views
30.
The authorities stressed that frontloaded adjustment was necessary to bolster
credibility. With sovereign solvency concerns mounting in many parts of Europe and gilt
spreads over German bunds rising in the first half of 2010, the authorities viewed
frontloading as imperative to demonstrate strong commitment to fiscal consolidation and
differentiate the UK from other fiscally troubled countries. Because spending is difficult to
turn around quickly, the frontloading requires some near-term tax increases, though the bulk

Under current law, the retirement age for state pensions, currently 60 for women and 65 for men, will be
gradually equalized at 65 for those retiring in 2020. The retirement age will increase further to 66 between 2024
and 2028, to 67 between 2034 and 2036, and to 68 between 2044 and 46.

saw merit in many of staff’s
recommendations and noted that decisions in these areas would be made in the upcoming
spending and pension reviews. On fiscal institutions, the authorities emphasized the
importance of the new OBR as a critical improvement aimed at addressing deficiencies in the
previous fiscal framework. The authorities also agreed that the current fiscal mandate is
designed to address the exceptional fiscal challenge and have set out their intention to
tighten the mandate (by shortening its horizon) once public finances are closer to balance.

V. MAINTAINING MONETARY STIMULUS
31.
Unprecedented monetary easing has helped restore confidence and bolster the
recovery. With fiscal policy constrained by the need to ensure sustainability, policy rates at
the lower bound, and their effect tempered by high bank lending spreads, the BoE has
provided significant additional stimulus through large-scale asset purchases. In total, the
central bank bought nearly £200 billion in medium- and longer-term gilts between March
2009 and January 2010, along with small amounts of commercial paper and corporate bonds.
Although the precise impact on aggregate demand remains hard to quantify, there is clear
evidence that quantitative easing has depressed bond yields and boosted asset prices, thereby
shoring up market confidence, household net wealth, and corporate credit supply (see Box 3).
Meanwhile, the prudent setup of the Asset Purchase Facility—with full ex-ante indemnity
from the Treasury—has preserved trust in the BoE’s operational independence.
32.
Yet, inflation over the last year has
continued to surprise on the upside (Figure 12).
From a trough at just above 1 percent in September
2009, CPI inflation rose to 3½ percent by early
2010 and has remained elevated since. Much of the
rise in the CPI can be attributed to the rebound of
commodity prices and the January 2010 hike in the
VAT rate. However, the continued overshooting

to additional price pressures that have set the UK apart from its advanced country peers:


A leading explanation is greater-than-expected pass-through from past sterling
depreciation (see Box 4). Indeed, allowing for pass-through on the order of 0.15-0.2
explains most of the cross-country dispersion in inflation outcomes over the last three
years. More disaggregated CPI data support this argument, as much of the inflation
dynamics since mid-2007 reflect a striking surge in goods prices, which have a
comparatively large import component.



A complementary explanation relates to the effect of spare capacity on inflation.
Although most indicators, notably unemployment and wage growth, point to
continued slack in the economy, corporate profit margins have proven atypically
resilient during the latest downturn—and not only among exporters, who have
benefited from the weaker currency. To some extent this suggests more limited spare
capacity than previously thought. Yet, firms’ unusual pricing behavior might also
reflect the particular influence of tight credit. Indeed, surveys show that many firms
have sought to avoid price cuts in order to preserve cash flow, implying a relatively
low short-term elasticity of demand. This particular influence is likely to wane as
credit concerns ease and competition for market share revives.

Arguably as a result of the recent above-target outturns, short-term inflation expectations
have edged up, whereas medium-term inflation expectations generally appear to remain wellanchored.

Box 3. Effectiveness of the Bank of England’s Quantitative Easing
Between March 2009 and January 2010, the BoE bought nearly £200 bn in medium- to long-term
gilts, financed by issuing reserve money. These purchases amount to 14 percent of UK GDP, 25 percent
of outstanding gilts, and 40 percent of gilts in the relevant market segment (at end-2009).
Event-study analysis suggests that the purchases have depressed yields by up to 125 basis points.
Judging from a two-day event window around key announcement dates, the gilt yield curve has shifted
downward by between 20 and 125 basis points, with the largest drop for long maturities. Using a oneday window, the effects are only half as large, but still significant.9 The strongest yield response is found
for March 5, 2009, when the first set of purchases was announced. Moreover, most of the decline in
yields appears to reflect portfolio balance effects caused by a lower net supply of gilts. OIS rates, which
would capture market expectations about future interest rate policy, fell by a small amount only.

Lower long-term interest rates have supported the
broader recovery in financial markets since March
2009. A clear-cut causal link from QE to the drawn-out
recoveries in equity, corporate bond, and other financial
markets is impossible to establish, given the many other
influences at work. Yet, it is striking that the launch of
QE in the UK—along with similar announcements in
the US—coincided with the turn-around in UK and
global equities. A positive spill-over from lower longterm yields is also consistent with evidence on the
effectiveness of the Fed’s asset purchases;

As such, QE has boosted confidence, created positive wealth effects, and improved the supply of
credit to corporates. The latter effect arose both directly, through small-scale BoE purchases of
commercial paper and corporate bonds, and indirectly, as large-scale gilt purchases induced investors to
shift funds into other assets, including corporate bonds. Together, these developments have bolstered the
recovery, even if the ultimate impact of QE on demand and inflation remains difficult to quantify.

CPI Inflation (percent)

A leading explanation for the inflation surprises is greater-than-expected pass-through
from past sterling depreciation. Recent research has generally documented low and declining
exchange rate pass-through in advanced economies. Based on this evidence, and the experience
of large sterling depreciation in the early

permanent.10
This explanation is also consistent with cross-sectional evidence. Relative to euro area
inflation since mid-2007, UK inflation has been highest for some elements of the CPI basket
that are likely to be very sensitive to exchange rate changes, such as gas and fuels, household
appliances, and package holidays. By contrast, inflation has been relatively moderate for
accommodation services, rent, and out-patient services.

10

Choudri and Hakura, for instance, report an average long-term pass-through coefficient of 0.16 for lowinflation economies, although the country-specific estimate for the UK is lower. See the Journal of
International Money and Finance 25 (2006), 614–639, Table 2.

37
33.
Underlying price pressures are expected to be moderate in the period ahead, but
another looming VAT hike will keep inflation above 2 percent throughout 2011. As the
effects of past price level shocks fade, inflation should continue to ease gradually. However,
the announced rise in the VAT rate in January 2011 is set to raise the CPI by another
1-1½ percentage points.11 Staff therefore projects inflation to remain above 2 percent
throughout 2011, although this masks the lingering downward pressure from spare capacity.
Indeed, most other pending fiscal measures, notably the two-year freeze of most public sector
salaries, will have a moderating effect on underlying inflation. Barring new shocks, this
effect should become apparent in headline inflation falling below target by early 2012.
34.
Risks around the central inflation projection are significant, but broadly
balanced. Historical episodes of persistent large output gaps suggest that disinflationary
pressures should ultimately take hold (see companion Selected Issues paper), but there is
considerable uncertainty about the strength of this effect. On the one hand, economic slack
and low wage growth could pull down inflation faster in the period ahead, especially if
corporate margins were to ease further. On the other hand, spare capacity might turn out to be
more limited or less potent than currently assessed. In this context, an extended series of
above-target inflation outturns entails the risk that rising inflation expectations might start to
feed back into wage and price-setting. In addition to these sources of uncertainty, the
inflation outlook is subject to the risk of further fluctuations in commodity prices and the
exchange rate.
35.
A highly accommodative monetary stance remains appropriate for now, but the
Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) will have to be nimble in responding to new
developments. The current stance reflects the need to maintain overall policy stimulus, as
economic activity remains below potential, fiscal policy is set to tighten sharply, and
financial intermediation normalizes only gradually. Near-term adjustments to the monetary
stance should be guided by incoming data. Developments in effective labor costs, other input
prices, and inflation expectations bear particularly close monitoring in this regard:


11

If a stalling recovery were to heighten disinflationary forces, quantitative easing
should be expanded. In the first instance, a resumption of gilt purchases represents a
natural policy option. The marginal effect of additional purchases is uncertain, but
some further flattening of the yield curve clearly seems achievable. If necessary, the
authorities should also consider the case for buying larger amounts of private sector
assets, chosen to target specific market dysfunctions or valuation anomalies that
might emerge in a renewed sharp downturn. However, such purchases may best be
framed as a fiscal operation—financed by the issuance of gilts, which the BoE could
separately decide to buy—to ensure proper accountability for the resulting financial

This is larger than the estimated effect of the temporary VAT cut in late 2008 (and subsequent reversal in
2010), as pass-through should be higher for permanent VAT changes, in line with international evidence.

38
and political risk. More generally, decisions on further quantitative easing need to
bear in mind their effect on the risk profile of the consolidated public sector balance
sheet, as they involve issuing a short-term liability (bank reserves) in exchange for
extinguishing a long-term liability (gilts) or acquiring a risky private-sector asset.


Conversely, the MPC must stand ready to start a gradual tightening if incoming
data raise the prospect of above-target inflation over the policy horizon. In this
case, the MPC intends to give standard Bank Rate increases priority over asset sales.
Staff concurs with this strategy, as changes in policy rates—the central bank’s
standard and proven tool—are easiest to fine-tune and best understood in terms of
their effects. Importantly, there is no reason to suspect that the expanded stock of base
money will compromise effective monetary control, given that reserves are fully
remunerated. Asset sales can, therefore, be programmed to occur at a pace that does
not interfere with stable gilt market conditions.

Authorities’ views
36.
The authorities generally agreed with staff’s views on the inflation outlook and
monetary stance, but opinions on the MPC have recently become more divided. The
majority of MPC members viewed the current policy stance as appropriate and favored a
data-dependent approach to next steps. For one MPC member, the balance of risks was such
that it was appropriate to start to withdraw some of the exceptional monetary stimulus
provided by the easing in policy in late 2008 and 2009. Another MPC member made the case
for expanding the asset purchase program so as to engineer a faster recovery, lest inflation
fall below target in the medium term. MPC members also differed on the likely effectiveness
of further gilt purchases—some could see arguments for “diminishing returns” from an
additional round of quantitative easing, while others were more optimistic.
VI. STRENGTHENING THE FINANCIAL SYSTEM
A. Financial Sector Soundness and Public Support
37.
Banking sector health has improved, but continued progress is needed to
enhance resilience and reduce risks to the economy and the taxpayer. To these ends:


Banks’ capital buffers should be strengthened further over time to prepare for
tighter regulatory requirements in the future, taking into account bank-specific
circumstances. Continued restraint on dividends and remuneration will be critical in
this regard. Although higher capitalization will decrease expected returns on equity,
this should be compensated by lower risks for bank stakeholders and society at large.
Larger capital buffers will also enhance banks’ ability to raise longer-term funds at
reasonable costs and maintain adequate credit supply to the private sector at all times.

39


Public funding support should be unwound in line with initial program design to
gradually reduce taxpayer risk and restore private sector responsibility. The crisis
exposed UK banks’ excessive reliance on unstable funding sources. Extensive public
support has provided temporary relief. However, the key facilities—the Special
Liquidity Scheme and the Credit Guarantee Scheme, which originally accounted for a
combined £320 billion in support—are set to wind down gradually in the coming
years. Against this backdrop, supervisors need to keep up the pressure on banks to
develop robust new funding models based upon a sound mix of simpler and more
transparent instruments. Progress in this direction would benefit from timely
clarification of how international and EU regulators will treat different capital and
funding instruments in the future.



The case for deeper structural changes to the UK financial sector needs to be
examined. Thus, the public debate on possible reforms, informed by the governmentappointed Independent Commission on Banking, which is to present a final report by
September 2011, is welcome.12 These issues, along with broader questions of
systemic stability, will also be taken up in a comprehensive assessment to be
conducted by staff in 2011, under the IMF’s “Financial Sector Assessment Program”
(FSAP).
B. Regulatory Reform

38.
The authorities should continue to work toward an ambitious international
package of regulatory reform and rigorous implementation of this package in the EU.
The UK has played a constructive role in the global regulatory debate, with innovative
proposals in many policy areas, pioneering work on recovery and resolution plans (RRPs),
and a blueprint set of new liquidity rules (see companion Selected Issues paper). The
authorities should continue to provide intellectual leadership, while cooperating closely with
their international partners to secure agreement on a suitable set of reforms. Building on the
recent Basel III and Financial Stability Board proposals, the following priorities stand out:

12



The UK is home to a number of very large financial institutions. Thus, the authorities
have rightly emphasized the need for concrete tools, such as capital and liquidity
surcharges, to address the resulting systemic risk.



In the same vein, greater international cooperation is needed to facilitate the
resolution of complex, cross-border financial institutions, as envisaged under the
authorities’ pilot exercise on RRPs. The UK’s 2009 Banking Act has provided an

http://bankingcommission.independent.gov.uk/bankingcommission/news-and-publications/.

40
effective national special resolution regime for banks.13 However, greater
international cooperation is indispensable to develop credible policy tools for
handling the failure of systemically important entities with complex, cross-border
activities. In this context, the UK authorities should support the EU’s ongoing efforts
to enhance the framework for cross-border supervision and resolution.
39.
The development of macroprudential instruments to mitigate the amplitude of
credit cycles is another key policy priority. Under the new prudential architecture, the
government will create a Financial Policy Committee (FPC) in the BoE with an explicit
mandate for macroprudential oversight, thus addressing a critical gap in the previous
framework. To perform its task, the FPC will require a well-defined financial stability
objective and adequate tools—such as variation in capital risk weights on specific asset
classes and in prudential standards, including limits on loan-to-value ratios. The authorities
have published a set of proposals along these lines, but many details remain to be settled.
Calibrating and communicating the FPC’s policy decisions will represent a particular
challenge, as little is known about their quantitative impact and interaction with monetary
policy. Moreover, some measures will need to be coordinated with foreign regulators,
especially within the EU, to be effective. The new European Systemic Risk Board provides a
useful forum for such coordination.
C. Moving to a New Regulatory Architecture
40.
Continued emphasis on proactive microprudential oversight is critical as the UK
moves to a new regulatory architecture. The government has decided to abolish the
tripartite system and charge the BoE—via a new subsidiary, the Prudential Regulation
Authority (PRA)—with the prudential regulation of deposit-taking institutions, investment
banks, and insurance companies. A separate new entity, the Consumer Protection and
Markets Authority, will be charged with ensuring consumer protection as well as regulation
of financial markets. Although this new setup should facilitate the integration of micro- and
macroprudential oversight, institutional changes alone are no guarantee for superior
outcomes, and any reorganization of this scale poses operational risks. It will thus be crucial
to carefully manage the transition while continuing to enhance the more intrusive, proactive,
and strategic approach to supervision adopted since the crisis.14 In this context:


In order to enhance consolidated supervisions, the PRA should have the authority to
directly supervise and, if necessary, give formal directions at the financial holding
company level.

13

HM Treasury is currently consulting on a special administration regime for investment firms, taking into
account the lessons learned from the collapse of Lehman Brothers.

14

See the recent IMF Staff Position Note on “The Making of Good Supervision—Saying “No” and Meaning
it.”

41


Adoption of a “prompt corrective action” regime would further strengthen the
supervisor’s capacity to address emerging risks at an early stage.15



Prudential oversight should be supported by market discipline. A useful tool in this
regard would be the regular public disclosure by the supervisor of non-confidential
firm-level prudential returns.



The tightening of banking sector regulation might cause risks to migrate into less
regulated parts of the financial system. A key task for the FPC, therefore, will be to
identify such risk migration and ensure a commensurate widening of the regulatory
perimeter.

Authorities’ views
41.
There was agreement on the reform agenda, although specific outcomes will
need to reflect international developments and domestic consultation processes. The
authorities expressed broad satisfaction with the initial set of Basel III proposals, but stressed
the need to make swift progress on outstanding items, notably a firming-up of liquidity
standards and creation of robust tools to contain systemic risk. The UK’s policy line, in this
regard, would be to push for ambitious reform, while seeking broad-based international
agreement to limit scope for regulatory arbitrage. In terms of the domestic reform agenda, the
government has laid out its priorities in a series of consultation papers and set up the
Independent Commission on Banking, and now awaits the outcome of these processes. In
this context, the authorities noted that they would consider staff’s specific proposals on
enhancing supervision.

15

The adoption of a prompt corrective action regime is one of the options cited in Treasury’s recent
consultation paper (“A New Approach to Financial Regulation: Judgement, Focus and Stability.”) to enhance
the regulator’s intervention powers.

42
VII. STAFF APPRAISAL
42.
The UK economy is on the mend, but crisis-related scars still need healing.
Economic recovery is underway, unemployment has stabilized, and financial sector health
has improved. These developments reflect both a natural cyclical rebound and the
authorities’ forceful policy actions, including large-scale financial-sector interventions,
temporary fiscal stimulus, unprecedented monetary easing, and the announcement of a strong
and credible multi-year fiscal consolidation strategy. The challenge going forward will be to
support sustainable economic recovery as the policy focus shifts from crisis management to
post-crisis repair. With the private sector running high financial surpluses and the public
sector posting record-high deficits, sustainable growth requires a gradual rebalancing toward
private and external sector-led demand.
43.
Consistent with these objectives, the government’s fiscal consolidation plans
have been instrumental in preserving confidence in debt sustainability. The plans are
also necessary to regain fiscal space to cope with future shocks. The fiscal mandate of
balancing the cyclically-adjusted current budget over a five-year rolling horizon––currently
by 2015/16––is ambitious but feasible, and its credibility has been bolstered by frontloaded
actions to achieve the mandate one year early. Market reaction has been positive, as the
consolidation greatly reduces the risk of a costly funding crisis and supports rebalancing.
These benefits outweigh expected costs in terms of adverse effects on near-term growth.
44.
A highly accommodative monetary stance remains appropriate to offset the
contractionary impulse from fiscal policy and keep inflation close to target over the
policy horizon. Barring unforeseen shocks, inflation should revert to target over the policy
horizon, as one-off price level shocks dissipate and disinflationary forces—existing spare
capacity and public sector wage restraint—keep underlying price pressures in check. The
BoE’s accommodative stance thus reflects the need to maintain overall policy stimulus as
fiscal tightening takes hold and financial intermediation normalizes only gradually.
45.
This policy mix should facilitate the necessary rebalancing while supporting a
moderate-paced recovery. With interest rates low and spare capacity within firms falling,
corporates are drawing on their strong financial positions to raise investment from its current
low levels. Similarly, although households are likely to remain thriftier than before the crisis,
they have begun to raise their consumption amid stabilizing labor markets and recovering
asset prices. Over time, past sterling depreciation should also boost net exports as higher
profit margins encourage expansion in import-competing and export sectors. This
progressive strengthening of private and external demand should underpin a moderate-paced
recovery, even as the public sector retrenches.
46.
Risks to this central scenario are substantial and policies will need to adapt if
they materialize. Downside risks include the continued fragility of confidence, still-strained
balance sheets among households and banks, and possible resurgence of sovereign and

43
47.
banking market turmoil in the euro area markets. Further, headwinds from fiscal
consolidation could turn out to be more powerful than expected. On the upside, expansionary
impulses from very low real interest rates, past sterling depreciation, and the ongoing
recovery of global demand could be greater than expected. This would boost the UK
economy onto a faster-than-expected growth path, but could also entail stronger inflationary
pressure. A key safeguard against these risks is the free operation of automatic fiscal
stabilizers in both directions. In addition, monetary policy must remain nimble: asset
purchases should resume if the recovery weakens and disinflationary pressures mount;
conversely, policy rates should tighten gradually if output recovers apace and inflation
continues to surprise on the upside. In the unexpected but possible case of a significant and
prolonged downturn, temporary targeted tax cuts should also be considered (alongside further
monetary easing), ideally combined with longer-term entitlement reforms to safeguard fiscal
sustainability and market credibility.
48.
The current spending and pension reviews provide an opportunity to further
mitigate risks by strengthening the quality of fiscal adjustment. International evidence
suggests that the planned emphasis on spending reduction increases the likelihood of a
successful consolidation. Within the spending envelope, however, more weight should be
given to reducing public sector compensation premia and achieving savings in benefits and
transfers through better targeting. This would help shield the vulnerable, mitigate the growth
effects of adjustment (as such cuts likely have smaller fiscal multipliers), and allow relatively
more spending on infrastructure investments that could boost potential growth. Entitlement
reforms, such as accelerating retirement age increases for state pensions and gradually
aligning the generosity of public sector pensions with those in the private sector, would
similarly bolster fiscal sustainability while having limited adverse effects on aggregate
demand now. The initiatives launched by the government to review such reforms are
therefore welcome.
49.
The authorities should continue to fortify fiscal institutions, building on
significant progress in this area. The establishment of a new independent OBR is an
important and welcome step. Though not a substitute for strong commitment to fiscal
discipline, the OBR should enhance the transparency and credibility of the budget process
and help inform policy decisions. As the role and remit of the permanent OBR are finalized,
its independence should be underpinned by sufficient legal authority and safeguards. In due
course the current fiscal mandate—an appropriate guide for the consolidation period—should
be replaced with a more permanent rule-based framework that would also be monitored by
the OBR.
50.
Efforts should continue to strengthen financial sector health and reduce related
risks to the economy and taxpayer. Toward these ends:


Capital buffers should be raised further, notably by restraining dividend payouts and
remuneration budgets, taking into account bank-specific circumstances.

44



Crisis-related public interventions should be unwound in line with initial program
design to gradually reduce taxpayer risk and restore private sector responsibility. To
help replace this support, supervisors should maintain pressure on banks to develop
robust new funding models based on a broad mix of simpler and more transparent
instruments.



The creation of an FPC with an explicit macroprudential mandate is welcome. To be
effective, many macroprudential measures will need to be closely coordinated with
regulators in other countries, notably within the EU. One critical task for the FPC will
be to identify risk migration into less regulated parts of the financial system and
ensure a commensurate widening of the regulatory perimeter.



The transition toward a new prudential architecture needs to be managed carefully to
mitigate operational risks. At the same time, the authorities should continue
enhancing the more intrusive, judgment-based, and strategic approach to supervision
adopted since the crisis. To assist this objective, it would be useful to: (i) provide the
PRA with authority to supervise and, if necessary, give formal directions at the
financial holding company level in order to enhance consolidated supervision; (ii)
adopt a “prompt corrective action” regime to strengthen the supervisor’s capacity to
address emerging risks at an early stage; and (iii) have the supervisor regularly
disclose nonconfidential firm-level prudential returns.



The UK authorities should continue their constructive efforts to secure an ambitious
international package of regulatory reform and rigorous implementation of this
package in the EU. In this regard, the authorities have rightly emphasized the need for
concrete tools to address risks arising from systemic financial institutions (e.g.,
through capital and liquidity surcharges and cross-border resolution frameworks).

In general, it will be important to promote internationally coordinated financial sector reform
to minimize regulatory arbitrage and to phase in reforms gradually to avoid strangling nearterm credit supply.
51.
It is recommended that the next Article IV consultation with the United Kingdom be
held on the standard 12-month cycle.

Annex A: Public Sector Debt Sustainability
General government gross debt is projected to increase from 43 percent of GDP in
2007/08 to about 85 percent of GDP in 2012/13 under the government’s planned
consolidation. The debt ratio would come down to 80 percent of GDP by 2015/16 (Table
A1). The baseline scenario for this debt sustainability analysis builds on staff’s central
scenario, hence taking into account the announced policies, and focuses on general
government gross debt. The primary deficit is expected to have peaked in 2009/10 at 9
percent of GDP and reach a 2 percent of GDP surplus in 2015/16. In cyclically-adjusted
terms, the primary balance would improve from 6 percent of GDP in 2009/10 to 2 percent in
2015/16. As a result, the debt ratio would be on a downward path from 2013/14, reaching 60
percent of GDP by 2025/26 if policies were unchanged after 2015/16 (Annex Box). Gross
financing needs in the near term are high—they are expected to reach 17 percent of GDP in
2010/11, driven by the high overall deficit, amortization, and an increased share of short-term
debt.
Alternative scenarios and bound tests highlight the uncertainties surrounding the
projected debt path (Figure A1). Higher interest rates, different growth scenarios, and
assumptions on primary balances as outlined below significantly affect debt outcomes. In
particular:


Debt would increase rapidly in the absence of fiscal consolidation. In a scenario
with a constant primary balance (in percent of GDP) over 2010/11-15/16, debt would
increase to 110 percent of GDP by 2015/16 and be on a firm upward path. The impact
of unchanged policies could be even higher, as concerns about sovereign debt
dynamics could lead to higher interest rates, adding to the interest bill and hence
accentuating the debt dynamics by increasing the distance from a debt-stabilizing
primary balance.



The debt projections are sensitive to interest rate developments. Real interest
rates in the baseline scenario are assumed to average 1.7 percent over the projection
period, reflecting the current low interest rate environment. Nonetheless, interest
expenditure is projected to rise significantly as a share of total expenditure. Should
real interest rates increase by half a standard deviation above the baseline, debt would
increase to 82 percent of GDP by 2015/16, some 2 percentage points of GDP above
the baseline.



If medium-term growth rates are persistently lower than anticipated, stabilizing
the debt ratio would require further adjustment. Assuming expenditure plans
remain unchanged, the debt-to-GDP ratio could reach 96 percent of GDP by 2015/16
should growth be 1¼ percentage points (½ a standard deviation) lower each year.

51
Annex Box. Required Fiscal Adjustment to Lower the Debt-to-GDP Ratio
Commandment III: you should target a long-term decline in the public debt-to-GDP ratio, not just
its stabilization at post-crisis levels (Ten Commandments for Fiscal Adjustment in Advanced
Economies, IMF, 2010).
Under current policies, staff projects that the gross general government debt-to-GDP ratio will peak
at 85 percent in 2012/13 before declining to 80 percent by 2015/16. Lowering the debt ratio to 60
percent by 2030/31 would require improving the cyclically-adjusted primary balance (CAPB) by 7.5
percentage points of GDP between 2009/10 and 2020/21. More specifically, the CAPB will need to
improve from a deficit of 6.1 percent to GDP in 2009/10 to a surplus of 1.5 percent of GDP by
2020/21 and be maintained at this higher level through 2030/31. However, staff estimates that the
measures laid out in the June budget would bring the CAPB to a surplus of 2 percent of GDP by
2015/16 – if the CAPB is maintained at this level, the debt ratio would reach 60 percent by 2025/26.

Lowering the debt-to-GDP ratio to 40 percent by 2030/31 would require improving the cyclicallyadjusted primary balance (CAPB) by 9 percentage points of GDP between 2009/10 and 2020/21.
That is, the CAPB will need to reach a surplus of 2.9 percent of GDP by 2020/21 and be maintained
constant at this higher level for the subsequent decade. In addition to announced policy plans
through 2015/16, further discretionary tightening of about ¾ percentage point of GDP over the
following five years to 2020/21 would be needed to achieve the debt target. Under this scenario the
debt-to-GDP ratio would fall below 60 percent of GDP by 2023/24.

Staff Report for the 2010 Article IV Consultation––Supplementary Information
Prepared by the European Department
(In consultation with other departments)
Approved by Ajai Chopra and Tamim Bayoumi
November 2, 2010
This supplement provides an update on key economic and policy developments that occurred
after the staff report was finalized. These developments do not affect the thrust of the staff
appraisal. Indeed, several of the announced policies in the recently released Spending
Review go in the direction recommended by staff (see paragraphs 25 and 47 in the staff
report).
Third quarter GDP release



Relative to previous announcements, by FY 2014/15 annual spending on social
benefits will be reduced by an additional £7 billion (0.4 percent of GDP). Of these
savings, £2.5 billion come from the elimination of the child benefit for higher-income
taxpayers (this benefit is currently universal), starting in 2013.2 Another £2.0 billion
in savings comes from placing a one-year time limit on certain benefits available to



The additional reduction in social
benefits lessens the required
retrenchment of other government
functions: excluding the protected
areas of health and foreign aid,
departmental spending will be
reduced by 19 percent in real
terms by 2014/15—less than the
25 percent real cuts announced in
the June budget.

The full elimination of this benefit once a certain income threshold is reached implies very high effective
marginal tax rates right at the threshold. However, the government views the simplicity of the reformed scheme
as a higher priority than avoiding such “cliff effects.”
3

With the new reductions, changes to social benefits now account for 25 percent of the reduction in total
primary expenditure, up from 15 percent in the June budget. The costing of savings from reductions in social
benefits was vetted by the newly established independent Office for Budget Responsibility. The OBR will also
take into account the effect of the revised spending plans on its economic growth projections when it next
updates its forecasts. However, staff does not expect the Spending Review to result in large growth revisions, as
it was largely in line with expectations.

3


Within departmental spending, transfers to local governments and public security face
some of the largest spending reductions (text chart).



The government plans to accelerate the increase in the state pension age (state
pensions are the universal scheme for both private and public employees). Proposed
legislation would equalize the pension age for women with that of men at 65 by 2018
(instead of 2020 as under current law) and raise it to 66 for both men and women
by 2020 (instead of 2026 as under current law).



Public employee pension contributions will rise by 3 percentage points on average,
yielding 0.1 percent of GDP by 2014/15. The ongoing review of pensions for public
sector employees (due by the time of the FY 2011/12 budget) is likely to yield
additional long-run savings in this area.



The total spending envelope remains very close to previous announcements. One
modest adjustment is a slight increase (by 0.1 percent of GDP by FY 2014/15) in the
allocation for capital expenditure, easing the real reduction in this category (relative
to FY 2010/11) from 33 percent to 29 percent. Although this increase in capital
expenditure is not offset by new savings elsewhere, the change does not affect
achievement of the government’s fiscal mandate, which aims to balance the cyclically
adjusted current budget.

3.
Several of the announced policies go in the direction recommended by staff.
Specifically, the government’s plans have (i) restricted some universal benefits—notably the
child benefit—to lower-income families in order to improve targeting; (ii) reduced somewhat
the reliance on capital expenditure cuts; (iii) lowered public sector compensation premia (in
the context of reforming public employee pensions); and (iv) modestly accelerated increases
in the state pension age. However, scope for reform, especially in the latter two areas, is not
yet exhausted. In this regard, the outcome of ongoing studies on public employee pension
reform and the further acceleration of increases in the state pension age will have important
effects on longer-run fiscal sustainability.
4.
Implementation of expenditure reductions remains a risk. Cuts of this magnitude
will be challenging to implement and may strain public service delivery in some areas.
However, the roughly even distribution of spending reductions across the next four years
should help ease adjustment costs. The effect of spending reductions on vulnerable segments
of society will need to be monitored closely.
Upgrade of ratings outlook
5.
Standard & Poor’s revised its outlook for the UK’s AAA rating from Negative to
Stable on October 26. S&P cited the Spending Review as a key factor behind the upgraded
outlook, noting that the Review had reduced uncertainty regarding the political resolve to

4
tackle the deficit. The rating agency’s decision reversed an earlier outlook revision from
May 2009.
Draft legislation for the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR)
6.
Draft legislation to establish the OBR on a permanent basis has been presented
to parliament. The draft legislation includes a number of safeguards to protect the OBR’s
independence, including fixed terms for members of the OBR’s executive committee, a
statutory veto for the Treasury Select Committee over their appointment and dismissal, and
an explicit statement that the OBR has discretion in performing its required duties, including
in determining its own work program beyond its statutory tasks. The draft law also gives the
OBR full access rights to information required to discharge its duties. To help safeguard the
OBR’s financial independence, Treasury has agreed to provide the OBR with a multi-year
budget for the period of the Spending Review.

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2010 Article IV Consultation with the
United Kingdom
On November 8, 2010 the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded
the Article IV consultation with the United Kingdom.1
Background
Economic recovery is underway in the UK. After six quarters of deep recession, the economy
started growing again in late 2009, led by a classic turn in the inventory cycle. More recently,
private final demand has also begun to recover modestly as the labor market has stabilized,
household saving rates have begun to ease, and corporates have begun to increase investment
from its low levels. However, past sterling depreciation has not yet boosted net exports as much
as expected. Meanwhile, inflation has surprised on the upside as a series of price level shocks
has more than offset the moderating effect of sizeable economic slack on underlying inflation.
The financial crisis has taken a toll on the fiscal position, with the overall deficit (excluding
financial sector interventions) in FY 2009/10 (April 6, 2009-April 5, 2010) rising to 11 percent of
GDP, one of the highest in the world. To ensure confidence in public finances and avoid
adverse market reactions, the government has set itself a fiscal mandate of balancing the
cyclically adjusted current budget (by the end of a rolling five-year horizon) and putting the net
debt-to-GDP ratio on a declining path by 2015/16, and it has announced plans to achieve these
1

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On
return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the
Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the
Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the
country's authorities. An explanation of any qualifiers used in summings up can be found here:

goals one year early. The adjustment is frontloaded and relies mainly on spending restraint, with
support from an increase in the VAT rate and other tax measures.
To counter disinflationary pressures and bolster economic recovery, the Bank of England (BoE)
has provided unprecedented monetary stimulus: the policy rate has been kept near zero, while
£200 billion in asset purchases (mostly of longer-term government bonds) have helped depress
bond yields and boost asset prices, thereby supporting market confidence, household net
wealth, and corporate credit supply.
Banking sector health has improved, as banks have raised capital, reduced leverage, and
increased earnings. Nonetheless, important challenges remain: regulatory requirements are set
to tighten over time; uncertainty about the sustainability of bank profits and the quality of some
exposures remains significant; and banks will need to raise significant amounts of new funding
as public support schemes taper off. Meanwhile, the authorities have laid out plans to revamp
the UK’s prudential architecture, consolidating key responsibilities in the BoE.
Looking ahead, economic recovery is expected to continue at a moderate pace as private and
external demand progressively gather strength while the public sector retrenches. GDP is
projected to grow at 1.7 percent this year and 2.0 percent in 2011. Risks around this forecast
are considerable, though broadly balanced, reflecting continued economic uncertainty both
globally and in the UK.
Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors welcomed the stabilization of the UK economy and its return to growth
reflecting the authorities’ strong policy actions, including large-scale financial-sector
interventions, unprecedented monetary easing, and temporary fiscal stimulus followed by the
announcement of a strong and credible multi-year fiscal consolidation strategy. The challenge
going forward will be to support a balanced and sustainable economic recovery. With the private
sector running high financial surpluses and the public sector running high deficits, sustainable
growth will require a gradual rebalancing toward private and external sector-led demand.
Directors generally supported the government’s frontloaded fiscal consolidation, as it preserves
confidence in debt sustainability, restores fiscal space to cope with future shocks, and supports
rebalancing. They agreed that these benefits outweigh expected costs in terms of a moderate
dampening of near-term growth.
Directors noted that the fiscal consolidation plans include an appropriate mix of tax and
expenditure measures. They welcomed the authorities’ efforts to preserve priority expenditures,
especially those that promote growth, protect vulnerable groups, and support official
development assistance. Directors commended the creation of an independent Office for

3
Budget Responsibility and encouraged the authorities to strengthen the fiscal framework further
by eventually replacing the current fiscal mandate, an appropriate guide for the consolidation
process, with more permanent fiscal rules.
Directors agreed that a highly accommodative monetary stance remains appropriate given the
need to maintain overall policy stimulus as fiscal tightening takes hold and financial
intermediation normalizes only gradually. This policy mix would facilitate the necessary
rebalancing while supporting a moderate-paced recovery and maintaining inflation near the
target over the policy horizon.
Directors noted that risks around this central scenario are substantial in both directions. They
agreed that a key safeguard against risks is the free operation of automatic fiscal stabilizers. In
addition, monetary policy must remain nimble. Policy rates should be raised gradually if output
recovers apace and inflation continues to surprise on the upside. Conversely, asset purchases
should resume if the recovery weakens and disinflationary pressures mount. In the unexpected
case of a significant and prolonged new downturn, some Directors considered that the pace of
structural fiscal consolidation could be adapted, market conditions permitting and ideally
combined with longer-term entitlement reforms to safeguard fiscal sustainability and market
credibility.
Directors supported continued efforts to strengthen financial sector health and reduce related
risks to the economy and taxpayer. This includes raising capital buffers over time, unwinding
crisis-related public interventions, and maintaining pressure on banks to develop robust new
funding models.
Directors welcomed the creation of a Financial Policy Committee with an explicit
macroprudential mandate. They emphasized that, to be effective, some macroprudential
measures should be internationally coordinated. The transition toward a new prudential
architecture also needs to be managed carefully to mitigate operational risks. In addition,
Directors encouraged the authorities to continue enhancing the more intrusive, judgment-based,
and strategic approach to supervision adopted since the crisis. They also looked forward to the
results of the 2011 Financial Sector Assessment Program update, including analysis of issues
such as the supervision of foreign banks in the UK and the resolution framework for non-banks.

Statement by Alex Gibbs, Executive Director for the United Kingdom
November 8, 2010
We thank staff for a very good report which is based on a productive staff mission to the
UK in September. My authorities’ views are appropriately described in the report. They
agree with staff’s main messages and welcome staff support for their strategy for fiscal
consolidation. This strategy has reduced the risk of adverse market conditions and is
expected to underpin household, business and market confidence, providing the
conditions for sustainable private sector-led growth in due course.
Outlook and recent economic developments
At the time of the last UK Article IV in summer 2009, the UK, along with other advanced
economies, was undergoing a severe contraction with risks to the outlook from rising
unemployment, falling house prices, deleveraging, tight credit conditions and losses in
the financial system. Since then, conditions have stabilised and the economy has returned
to growth. Real GDP has now grown for four consecutive quarters to a level 2.8 per cent
higher than in the last quarter of falling output (Q3 2009).
The economic forecast that underpins the UK budget is now the responsibility of the
newly created and independent Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR). Its central
economic forecast is for the recovery to gather pace - 1.2% this year, 2.3% next – rising
to above trend rates from 2012 as the private sector recovery strengthens and the
economy becomes more balanced. Growth in the second and third quarters of 2010 was
higher than the OBR forecast in June. The reasons for the OBR’s slightly stronger growth
projections for 2011 as compared with staff are explained in the staff report, and include
a larger contribution from net exports and stronger fixed investment. Global demand,
however uneven, is necessary to sustain the UK recovery, and domestic demand is likely
to be supported by some gradual moderation in private savings.
As staff mention in their report, labour market performance has been better than
envisaged at the time of last year’s assessment. Although output fell by more than 6%
during the recession, employment fell by less than 2%. Employment increased by
178,000 in the 3 months to August, and is now at the level projected to be reached by mid
2012 in the OBR forecast.
Significant uncertainties remain, especially around the strength of the global recovery.
My authorities’ strategy is to mitigate risks and address the underlying economic
imbalances that contributed to the crisis in order to promote sustainable, private sectorled growth. Alongside the consolidation of fiscal policy they have introduced measures to
support investment and growth. They have avoided sharply raising taxes on capital and
labour, focusing instead on reforming corporation tax to reduce the cost of capital and
promote investment. Welfare reforms are designed to encourage and reward work while
protecting the most vulnerable in society. Efficiency savings are sought across the public
sector.

On the inflation outlook, my authorities agree with the staff that the forthcoming VAT
increase means that inflation is likely to remain above the 2% target until the end of
2011. While there is some risk that a prolonged period of above target inflation may
cause medium-term inflation expectations to increase, we expect inflation to fall back
below the target, given the spare capacity in the economy and labour market.
Fiscal policy
In their 2009 Article IV assessment of the UK, staff sought a stronger commitment to
fiscal consolidation and a more ambitious medium-term fiscal adjustment path. Staff
urged greater clarity on specific adjustment measures with a focus on expenditure
reduction. The new Government, which took office in May 2010, agrees with this advice.
Tackling the fiscal deficit in a way that will help promote growth is the most urgent task
facing the UK economy.
The Government’s June Budget therefore set out an accelerated plan for fiscal
consolidation, which at around 2% of GDP by 2014-15 was toward the upper end of
outside expectations. This has been received positively by the markets. Around three
quarters of the consolidation will come from spending restraint, in line with staff advice
and international evidence on what determines an effective and lasting consolidation.
Following the June Budget, the October Spending Review set out £81 billion of spending
reductions to deliver the consolidation plan, while at the same time seeking to protect
priority areas of expenditure, including those that promote economic growth. Key
transport and infrastructure projects have been supported, and areas of resource spending
that are important for growth have also been prioritised, including through a real terms
increase in the core schools budget of 0.1% a year, spending on science being maintained
in cash terms and a £1.4 billion regional growth fund. My authorities are also committed
to protecting the UK’s budget for overseas development assistance from expenditure cuts
and to delivering the target of ODA at 0.7 per cent of GDP.
A particular focus of policy has been to achieve the consolidation in a way that helps
address longer-term fiscal pressures. Therefore my authorities are reforming State
Pension provision by bringing forward the equalisation of State Pension Age for men and
women at 65 to November 2018, and accelerating subsequent increase to 66 by 2020.
This will significantly offset the cost to the public sector of increasing longevity, and my
authorities are also considering bringing forward further planned pension age increases.
Public sector employees’ pension contributions will rise, leading to additional savings of
£1.8 billion a year by 2014-15. Further savings will be those delivered through reforms to
social benefits and transfers from central to local government.
According to OBR projections, these measures taken together should eliminate the
cyclically-adjusted current deficit by 2014-15 and place public sector net debt on a
downward path in the same year.

Fiscal Framework
The staff report describes well the steps my authorities have taken to strengthen the fiscal
framework and provide greater transparency and credibility to the UK’s official
economic and fiscal forecasts in particular by creating the new independent Office for
Budget Responsibility (OBR). The need for a reform on these lines has been a theme of
staff advice to the UK in several previous Article IV cycles. The OBR will produce
independent macroeconomic and fiscal forecasts on which all budget decisions will be
based, judge the consistency of the Government’s fiscal policy with its fiscal mandate,
and assess the sustainability of the public finances. The OBR has been operating on an
interim basis since May 2010, and legislation was introduced to Parliament on 21
October to establish the OBR and its core functions in statute.
The fiscal mandate my authorities have adopted to guide policy decisions over the
medium term is to set policy to achieve cyclically-adjusted current balance by the end of
the rolling, five-year forecast period. This fiscal mandate is supplemented by a target for
public sector net debt as a percentage of GDP to be falling at a fixed date of 2015-16. On
current plans, the UK is forecast by the OBR to meet the mandate and supplementary
debt target a year early.
Monetary policy
With fiscal policy constrained, and the recovery still fragile, the Bank of England has
maintained a supportive monetary stance with policy rates at the lower bound and
additional stimulus provided through large scale asset purchases. As shown in the staff
report, the programme of asset purchases have had a significant impact on financial
markets and particularly gilt yields, and its effects should continue to be felt on the wider
economy for some time to come.
The current weakness in broad money growth is likely to be related to continued
adjustment of bank balance sheets, and could be seen as a corollary of bank deleveraging.
The Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) judges it appropriate to maintain Bank Rate at
0.5% and the stock of assets financed by reserves at £200bn; the Committee will continue
to assess month by month whether a change in policy in either direction is warranted (the
MPC’s next decision will be this Thursday, 4 November). When and if it feels it is
appropriate to begin tightening policy, this is most likely to occur through a rise in Bank
Rate with asset sales being conducted later in an orderly programme over a period of
time.
Financial policy and framework
Conditions in the UK’s financial sector are much improved with higher bank capital
ratios, increasing bank profitability and a successful conclusion to CEBS stress testing for
UK banks. This has helped build resilience to further shocks.
However, my authorities remain vigilant and mindful that funding challenges remain,
exacerbated by renewed uncertainty over the macro outlook. UK banks envisage (realised
and prospective) balance sheet reduction as central to helping meet this funding
challenge. Central to addressing all these issues is the need for appropriate risk

management – with close monitoring of firms’ governance, culture, policy, processes and
systems.
As explained in the staff report, the case for structural reform in the UK banking sector is
currently being assessed by an Independent Commission on Banking which will report in
September 2011.
Systemic risk in the financial system is being addressed through regulatory and
institutional reform. The staff report and Selected Issues paper (chapter VI) explain the
Government’s wide ranging programme, an important part of which is to give the Bank
of England responsibility for macro-prudential regulation and oversight of microprudential regulation. As part of this, a new Prudential Regulatory Authority will be
created, as a subsidiary of the Bank, and a separate, independent Consumer Protection
and Markets Authority (CPMA) will also be established. The Government will also
legislate for the creation of a new Financial Policy Committee with macro-prudential
oversight.
My authorities are committed to full implementation of the recently agreed Basel III
requirements and UK banks appear well placed to meet these new requirements in a
timely manner. My authorities intend to continue to play a full role in international and
EU discussions on strengthening the financial sector, and enhancing international
cooperation. They are fully cognizant of the risks as well as benefits posed by
interconnected global markets and firms, and are supportive of the drive to build a
strategic global approach to regulation, enabling effective risk management through
coordinated macro-prudential analysis, harmonised prudential rules, effective supervision
of cross-border firms and fair, and orderly global markets.
As staff note, my authorities look forward to exploring many of the issues relating to the
financial sector in more detail in the forthcoming Financial Sector Assessment
Programme which will be conducted during the first half of 2011 and be discussed by the
Board alongside the 2011 Article IV report, in conjunction with a pilot Spillover Report
for the UK.
