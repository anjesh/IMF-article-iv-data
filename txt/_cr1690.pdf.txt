IMF Executive Board Completes the Fifth and Sixth Reviews Under an ECF
Arrangement with Solomon Islands, Approves SDR 0.297 Million (US$ 0.42 million)
Disbursement
On March 21, 2016, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF)
completed the fifth and sixth reviews of the Solomon Islands’ economic performance under
the Extended Credit Facility (ECF) arrangement.
Completion of the fifth and sixth reviews enables the Solomon Islands to draw an amount
equivalent to SDR 0.297 million (about US$ 0.42 million) immediately, bringing total
disbursements under the arrangement to an amount equivalent to SDR 1.04 million (about
US$ 1.46 million).
The three-year ECF arrangement was first approved December 7, 2012, in an amount
equivalent to SDR 1.04 million (about US$ 1.46 million), or 10 percent of the country’s
quota (see Press Release No. 12/479). In December 2015, the Executive Board extended the
ECF to March 31, 2016 to allow the authorities enough flexibility to make further progress in
implementing their structural reform agenda under the program (see Press Release No.
15/575).
During the same meeting, the Board also concluded the 2016 Article IV consultation. A
separate press release will be issued shortly.
Following the Executive Board’s discussion, Mr. Mitsuhiro Furusawa, Deputy Managing
Director and Acting Chair, stated:
“Solomon Islands has made enormous strides in enhancing macroeconomic stability in recent
years, with satisfactory implementation of the authorities’ economic program supported by
the IMF’s Extended Credit Facility (ECF) arrangement. Important reforms have been
implemented including in public financial management (PFM), tax administration, debt
management, exchange rate regime, and the financial sector.

2

“Solomon Islands continues to face long-term development challenges and opportunities.
The Medium-Term Development Plan articulates a comprehensive growth and development
strategy and implementation plan that are aligned with the Sustainable Development Goals.
A multi-pillar strategy at the national, regional, and multilateral levels is crucial to enhance
resilience to natural disasters.
“With uncertainty regarding future sources of growth and a challenging external outlook,
fiscal space should be preserved. In implementing the 2016 budget and in formulating future
budgets, the authorities should keep cash reserves at a minimum of two months of total
spending. The authorities should sustain efforts to advancing PFM reforms, including by
improving the transparency and accountability of scholarships and constituency funds and by
continuing to strengthen the quality of public spending.
“Monetary policy is appropriate. But given the high credit growth, the authorities should
remain vigilant. The basket peg regime is working well and the level of the exchange rate
should be assessed periodically to ensure that it remains supportive of competitiveness and
growth.
“The financial system is sound and the authorities’ efforts to further strengthen supervision
and regulation should continue. The new National Provident Fund Act, a new Credit Unions
Act and a new Financial Institutions Act should help enhance financial sector stability. The
recently adopted National Financial Inclusion Strategy for 2016–20 will help expand
financial access, especially in rural areas.”

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2016 Article IV Consultation with Solomon Islands
On March 21, 2016, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded
the 2016 Article IV Consultation with Solomon Islands.1
The Solomon Islands economy is estimated to have grown by 3.25 percent in 2015 led by
logging activity, tuna processing, construction, and retail services. The impact of Cyclone Raquel
and El Niño has caused a reduction in agricultural production. After experiencing deflation
earlier in the year, inflation remained contained at 2.9 percent (year-on-year) in 2015, driven by
higher food prices due to the depreciation of the Solomon Island dollar vis-à-vis the US dollar
and the effects of El Niño-related drought on the domestic food supply.
Near-term prospects are favorable but risks to the outlook are tilted to the downside. In 2016,
growth is expected to remain solid at 3 percent, driven by investment in construction,
communications, and manufacturing. Weaker growth in emerging Asia—especially China—
could worsen Solomon Islands’ growth prospects, including through lower-than-expected
demand for log exports. The El Niño phenomenon will likely continue to weigh on agriculture
and fisheries in the early part of 2016.
In 2015, fiscal policy was much less expansionary relative to the budget. The fiscal deficit is
estimated at 0.3 percent of GDP, much smaller than 5.7 percent budgeted. The fiscal deficit was
financed by a small drawdown in the cash balance. Although the decline in cash balance in 2015
was much larger than implied by the deficit, the drawdown also reflected the repayment of
SI$100 million of domestic debt in mid-December 2015. Public debt at 10.4 percent of GDP is
one of the lowest in the region and across small states.

1

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with members, usually
every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial information, and discusses with officials
the country's economic developments and policies. On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which
forms the basis for discussion by the Executive Board.

2
The monetary policy stance has been very accommodative in an effort to support growth and this
has been reflected in strong credit growth. The financial system is sound, and progress on
financial inclusion has been remarkable, although further financial deepening represents
important growth and development opportunities. The domestic financial sector has undergone
significant consolidation in 2015, and overall, banks are adequately capitalized, liquid, and
profitable.
Net international reserves remained flat at US$506 million at end-December 2015 relative to
end-2014 (US$496 million), equivalent to 9.8 months of imports, the highest coverage in the
Pacific islands. The current account deficit will widen slightly to 4.5 percent of GDP in 2016, but
the external position should remain strong with net international reserves projected at 9.6 months
of imports. In the medium term, the current account deficit is expected to widen somewhat to
support imports related to big infrastructure projects.
Executive Board Assessment2
Executive Directors welcomed Solomon Islands’ satisfactory performance under the program
and commended the authorities for their considerable achievements in enhancing
macroeconomic stability owing to a prudent fiscal policy and the implementation of structural
reforms, including notable progress in building core institutions.
Directors noted that, while the economic outlook is favorable, it is subject to downside risks
from the country’s vulnerabilities to external shocks, including natural disasters. They
emphasized the importance of preserving fiscal buffers, enhancing resilience to natural disasters,
and stepping up the structural reform agenda to foster inclusive and diversified growth. In this
regard, Directors welcomed the new Medium-Term Development Plan (2016–20), which
contains a comprehensive growth and development strategy that is aligned with the Sustainable
Development Goals. They looked forward to the authorities’ continued close engagement with
the Fund and development partners to support its implementation.
Directors supported the design of a multi-pillar strategy at the national, regional, and multilateral
levels to enhance resilience to natural disasters. They welcomed the plan to create a contingency
fund for natural disasters.
Directors stressed the importance of preserving fiscal space and adequate buffers. They
encouraged the authorities to keep cash reserves at a minimum of two months of total spending
and to prioritize infrastructure and social spending. They also welcomed the authorities’
intention to set quarterly targets on cash reserves in their budgeting process. Directors
encouraged the authorities to sustain their efforts to build sound fiscal institutions in order to
finance infrastructure spending while preserving debt sustainability. These include public

At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the Board, summarizes the views of
Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the country's authorities. An explanation of any qualifiers
used in summings up can be found here: http://www.imf.org/external/np/sec/misc/qualifiers.htm.

financial management reforms by enhancing the transparency and accountability of tertiary
scholarship and constituency funds; improvements in budget planning and presentation; and the
mobilization of additional revenues by strengthening tax compliance and streamlining
exemptions.
Directors considered the current monetary policy stance to be appropriate. They encouraged the
central bank to stand ready to tighten policy should inflationary pressures emerge, and consider
appropriate measures to absorb excess liquidity to improve monetary transmission. Directors
welcomed the full implementation of the basket peg. They encouraged the authorities to reassess
periodically the level of the exchange rate to ensure that it remains supportive of
competitiveness, and to consider including the renminbi in the basket.
Directors noted that the financial sector is generally sound, and called for continued efforts to
strengthen the supervisory, regulatory, and legal frameworks. They welcomed the forthcoming
new National Provident Fund and Credit Union Acts to help safeguard financial stability.
Directors encouraged the authorities to build on the progress achieved to improve financial
inclusion and access, and welcomed the recently adopted National Financial Inclusion Strategy
for 2016–20.
Directors supported the authorities’ agenda aimed at achieving inclusive growth and diversifying
the sources of growth. This will involve reforms to improve the business and investment climate,
infrastructure development, as well as investments in health, education, and human resource
development.

STAFF REPORT FOR 2016 ARTICLE IV CONSULTATION AND
THE FIFTH AND SIXTH REVIEWS UNDER THE EXTENDED
CREDIT FACILITY ARRANGEMENT

KEY ISSUES
Context: Solomon Islands is a small island state, a low-income country that is severely
affected by external shocks, including commodity price declines, natural disasters, and
climate change.
Program: Solomon Islands has achieved considerable gains in terms of macroeconomic
stability under the Extended Credit Facility program. Policy buffers are among the
highest in the Pacific small states and other small states. Despite the low access, the
program has been effective in catalyzing donor support. Quantitative program
performance has been excellent and progress in the structural reform agenda has
helped greatly in achieving macroeconomic stability.
Article IV Consultation: The consultation introduced a policy framework to address
natural disasters and climate change. It focused on policies that could support the
Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) identified by the authorities in the new National
Development Strategy (NDS) for 2016–35.
Outlook and risks: Economic growth in 2015 is estimated at 3¼ percent. Near-term
prospects remain favorable but new sources of growth are needed over the medium
term. Risks are tilted to the downside, notably weaker growth in emerging Asia.
Key policy recommendations:
 Enhance resilience to natural disasters by developing and implementing a multipillar strategy at the national, regional, and multilateral levels.
 Preserve cash reserves as a buffer against shocks at no less than two months of total
spending.


Improve the quality of public spending by advancing PFM reforms.

 Mobilize additional revenue by strengthening tax compliance and streamlining
exemptions to finance infrastructure spending and preserve debt sustainability.
 Maintain the current monetary stance, but stand ready to tighten if inflationary
pressures emerge and continue implementing the currency basket peg exchange rate
regime.
 Strengthen financial regulation and supervision—including supervision of the
National Provident Fund—and continue championing financial inclusion.

THE SETTING AND OUTLOOK
1.
Solomon Islands is a small island state and a low-income country that faces severe
development challenges as well as great opportunities. Some challenges are common to other small
Pacific island nations in fragile situations: vulnerability to external shocks, including terms of trade,
natural disasters and climate change; poor infrastructure; high dependency on aid; a history of social
unrest; and weak capacity. The population is geographically dispersed—with 80 percent living in rural
areas. The economy has traditionally been supported by logging activity as well as agriculture. But with
the forestry sector expected to decline over the medium and long term, new sources of growth and a
more diversified economy are needed to keep living standards from falling. Tourism has enormous
potential as well as its combined synergies with agriculture. Moving up the value chain in the fishery
sector also has great potential. All this will require better infrastructure, improved public financial
management (PFM), and a better business climate to attract much-needed FDI to finance development
needs. External financing and technical assistance from development partners will continue to be
important in meeting these challenges and tapping these opportunities.
The ECF-supported program has helped enhance resilience and strengthen institutions

introduction of a multi-year budget framework;
a new debt management framework to strengthen debt management capacity and sustainability); and
financial sector reforms such as the new Central Bank of Solomon Islands Act to enhance Central Bank’s
independence (MEFP, Table 1). These reforms have helped strengthen macroeconomic management.
Despite the low access, the ECF-supported program has been instrumental in catalyzing donors
support. The pace of reforms has slowed over the last year but progress has continued. Under the ruling
coalition led by Prime Minister Sogavare, the policy focus has shifted to rural development and more
recently, to anti-corruption. Given delays associated with the completion of the structural agenda for
the fifth review and sixth reviews, the authorities have requested an extension of the ECF-supported
program through end-March 2016 and that the fifth and sixth reviews be combined.

Near-term prospects remain favorable. In
(In percentage points)
2016, growth is expected to stay solid, at 3 percent.
Activity will be driven by investment in construction,
communications, and manufacturing—owing to a new
brewery and tobacco factory, and higher yields from
increased tuna processing capacity. Because of the
current economic slowdown in China, lower demand for
logging exports is expected in the near term. The
ongoing El Niño event—forecast to continue at least
until the first half of 2016—will reduce fish catch as well
as agricultural production. Inflation is expected to stabilize around 1.5-3 percent in the near term.
Continued low fuel prices are also likely to support consumption and lower production costs. The
current account deficit will widen slightly to 4.5 percent of GDP in 2016, but the external position should
remain strong, with net international reserves projected at 9.6 months of imports.

New sources of growth are needed in the medium term. With the continued fall in logging
production, growth will need to be supported by increased productivity across a wide range of sectors,
including agriculture, tuna processing, and tourism. Boosting the economy’s competitiveness by
investing in infrastructure is also key to strengthening medium-term growth. The planned decline in aid
from Regional Assistance Mission to Solomon Islands (RAMSI) which will be totally wound down by
2017, could pose additional medium-term challenges. Given the weaker prospects for mining activity
and more frequent natural disasters, staff has lowered the countries’ potential growth from 4 to 3
percent. The current account deficit is expected to widen somewhat to support imports related to large
infrastructure projects.

…but headwinds are strong
6.
Risks to the outlook are tilted to the downside. Weaker growth in emerging Asia—especially
China—could worsen Solomon Islands’ growth prospects,1 including through lower-than-expected
demand for log exports. The outlook for nickel mining continues to be clouded by protracted litigation;
and the nascent bauxite sector is not expected to contribute to near-term growth despite the recent
resolution of licensing disputes. El Niño will likely weigh on agriculture and fisheries. Long-standing
plans for large infrastructure projects—the Tina River Hydropower Plant and submarine cable
projects2—could have stronger-than-expected positive spillovers, although their implementation could
be delayed again.
Authorities’ Views

The authorities’ economic outlook is broadly consistent with that of the staff. They also
see risks tilted to the downside and mainly external. Weakening growth in emerging Asia is a source of
concern.

procurement process. Net international reserves remain at comfortable levels. The cash balance for
December 2015, although outside the monitoring of the program, stood at SI$694 million (3.2 months
of recurrent spending). The government has also maintained cash reserves of the consolidated accounts
at SI$140 million (0.7 month of recurrent spending) (Table 1 and MEFP Table 2).
9.
Structural reforms have continued in the context of the ECF arrangement and the
program’s objectives have been achieved. As indicated in the MEFP, the authorities remain firmly
committed to completing the reforms even after the ECF-supported program expires. The pace of the
legislative process is proceeding steady, as the authorities’ commitment to tabling several bills at the
next sitting of Parliament, even though continued capacity constraints in the Attorney General’s
Chambers and the complexity of these legislations have slowed down the process.


Implementation of benchmarks related to the new customs and excise bill (end-September 2015
benchmarks) is proceeding and the bill was approved by the cabinet in February, together with the
Policy Paper on the Credit Union legislation (end September 2015 benchmark) which will be
integrated into a draft bill (end September 2015 benchmark) already prepared with the TA support
by the Asian Development Bank and will be vetted by the Attorney General once approved by
cabinet. The recent approval by the cabinet signals the strong momentum for these bills to proceed
to the next stage of the enactment process. Similarly, a policy paper for cabinet submission is being
prepared for the National Provident Fund (NPF) bill.



On education policies, progress in implementing the two benchmarks has been made. The
rebalancing of spending away from tertiary education has been met in 2015.3 Policies on the award
and continuation of tertiary scholarships have been tightened to achieve better targeting and
contain costs. The government has identified problems with the quality and quantity of the teaching
cadre that will require greater investment in tertiary teacher preparation programs to meet
projected supply needs at the elementary/secondary level.



Regarding the benchmark on implementing regulations of the Constituency Development Funds
(CDF) Act, the authorities, in consultation with PFTAC, have proposed an alternative commitment to
increase transparency and accountability in the use constituency funds: namely the implementation
of procurement regulations under the Public Financial Management Act, which apply to all
government procurements. Thereby the regulations of the CDF Act have been superseded by the
enactment of the Public Financial Management Act. Steps have been already taken to improve the
accountability and transparency of these funds through more disciplined procurement processes
and the application of the PFM Financial Instructions. In staff’s assessment, this alternative
commitment addresses issues of accountability and transparency, which was the intent of the
original benchmark, and is an adequate substitute.



The benchmark on the publication of the results of the audit reports on the use of spending of CDFs
is close to being met. The audit reports have been completed by the Auditor General and will be
submitted to Parliament at the next sitting before they are released to the public.

The share of government-funded spending on tertiary education decreased from 33.3 percent in 2014 to 30.5 percent
in 2015.

Box 1. Solomon Islands—Synergies Between the Structural Agenda under the ECF
Arrangement and Macro-Financial Stability
The structural reforms under the ECF arrangement have helped enhance macroeconomic and
financial stability. Even where reforms are still in progress, the preparatory groundwork is continuing to
support their implementation in due course.



The new Central Bank of Solomon Islands (CBSI) Act, by providing more independence to the
Central Bank has helped maintain a sound fiscal position (December 2012 benchmark) and has
strengthened the effectiveness of monetary policy.



The benchmarks related to debt management strategy, including SOE borrowing policy, on-lending
policy and guarantee policy have contributed to increase fiscal space.



PFM reforms (the New Public Financial Management Act, budget strategy document, mid-year
budget review and final budget outcome report, and multi-year fiscal framework) have helped
strengthening fiscal institutions.

Reforms that are still in progress are also important for financial and macro stability:



In anticipation of the new financial institutions Act—developing financial instruction was a June
2014 benchmark—the CBSI has already laid the groundwork and issued or endorsed several
Prudential Guidelines in these areas. For example, in 2015 CBSI issued two Prudential Guidelines to
banks on more disclosure on bank fees and charges levied on customers and a complaints
management framework and procedures for banks for dealing with complaints from customers. The
issue of consumer protection is also very important in the CBSI leading role on financial inclusion,
which has been also covered by a benchmark under the ECF-supported program (March 2013
benchmark).



In February 2016, in anticipation of the new FIA, the CBSI Board endorsed a Fitness and Propriety
Regulation for applicants who apply for a license to establish a financial institution in Solomon
Islands as part of the licensing and governance requirements. This regulation will be submitted to
the Minister of Finance for further endorsement and gazetting.



In anticipation of the new Credit Union Act, the CBSI Board has endorsed a new Prudential
Guideline on Credit Union Investments as part of good corporate governance. This guideline came
into force on 1 March 2016.

The CBSI Board also endorsed a new Prudential Guideline on Investments for the National Provident Fund
(NPF) that will come into force after further consultations with NPF.

Beyond the ECF-supported Program
10.
When the arrangement expires, staff plans to continue the close engagement built over
the last few years. This will include the provision of policy advice on a 12-month Article IV consultation
cycle on macroeconomic policies and structural reforms that are macro critical in close coordination
with other development partners. In line with Fund’s new commitments under the Financing for
Development agenda to increase its focus on fragile states, we aim to step up IMF TA and trainings over
the medium term. Given the focus of the government on rural development the Fund could support
these objectives by offering policy advice and TA in key areas of Fund’s work (macroeconomic

POLICIES TO SUPPORT THE SDGS—INVESTING IN
RESILIENCE AND FOSTERING FINANCIAL INCLUSION
11.
Achieving the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) is at the top of the government’s
development agenda. In the forthcoming National Development Strategy (NDS) covering 2016–35, the
authorities have identified five specific development objectives and aligned them to corresponding
Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).
12.
To achieve the SDGs and align them in a coherent policy framework, the authorities have
developed a five-year rolling plan—the medium–term development-plan (MTDP) 2016-20.
Approved by Parliament in December, the MTDP is designed to translate the government’s long-term
development objectives into operational priorities and specific programs and projects, and also align
them with annual budget plans for line ministries. The MTDP has been submitted to the Board by the
authorities as the economic development document (EDD) and meets the Fund’s requirements under
the new policy for poverty reduction strategies. The plan lays out specific reforms in the main economic
sectors and proposes important advances in land policies, governance, and anti-corruption. It identifies
priority spending areas and strategies to enhance spending effectiveness, including by further
strengthening public finance management to reach better resource allocation decisions. It sets out
policies to manage the impact of climate change and natural disasters that can jeopardize development
outcomes, including through greater emphasis on disaster risk preparedness and mitigation.

In building stronger institutions and achieving the related SDG, an anti-corruption bill is
being prepared, with drafting to be completed in the first quarter of 2016. This bill is one of the
government’s top priorities and aims to put the bill before parliament by mid-2016 (MEFP, paragraph
8). The Anticorruption Bill is being accompanied by the Whistle Blower Bill and a revamped
Ombudsman Bill. Measures to strengthen the anti-corruption framework will help enhance transparency
in the use of public resources, could improve business climate, and boost investor confidence.

A review of the former NDS covering 2011-20 prepared by the Ministry of Planning in
February 2015 found that only 28 percent of the indicators reflected any progress towards

The MTDP has a strong emphasis on poverty reduction and allocates resources totaling SI$183
million (2 percent of GDP) to this end. The plan includes investments in water supply and sanitation,
a constituency renewable rural electrification program, and a national food security enhancement
program. Overall, SI$730 million (or 8 percent of GDP) has been earmarked for health, education, and
human resource development under the MTDP.
15.
Enhancing policymaking in four key areas would help Solomon Islands attain its
development goals. It will also help lock in the progress to date in strengthening macroeconomic
performance and institutions under the IMF-supported programs. In line with the NDS objective and
corresponding SDGs, the Article IV Consultation thus focused on the following policies:


Enhancing resilience to natural disasters and climate change;



Preserving fiscal space while investing in resilient infrastructure;



Enhancing monetary and exchange rate policy tools for stability and growth; and



Promoting financial deepening and inclusion to foster inclusive growth

A. Policy Framework to Enhance Resilience to Natural Disasters and Climate
Change
16.
Climate change and natural disasters are macrocritical in Solomon Islands. The
combination of its location (along the ring of fire of the Pacific Rim) and its small size heightens its
vulnerability to earthquakes, cyclones, tsunamis, and floods. The damage and losses related to flash
floods in 2014 were estimated at 9 percent of GDP.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

11

SOLOMON ISLANDS

17.
IMF staff analysis suggests that natural disasters in the Pacific have a negative impact on
both short-term and potential growth.4 A natural disaster with damages and losses equivalent to
1 percent of GDP causes a drop in GDP averaging 0.3 percentage point in the year of the disaster. Given
the large impact of the natural disasters, potential growth in Solomon Islands is estimated to be lower
by 0.3 percentage point per year.
18.
In the context of the Medium-Term Development Plan, the authorities have designed
several programs on both climate change mitigation and adaptation. The Ministry of Agriculture
contributes to both these goals by shielding farmers from the impact of natural disasters and climate
change; enhancing soil conservation and management; improving land fertility or using crops that are
climate-change-proof; and enforcing the regulatory framework. The government is currently setting up
a contingency fund for natural disasters.

Staff’s Views
19.
Enhancing resilience to natural disasters and climate change entails a multi-pillar strategy
at the national, regional, and multilateral levels. It also requires enhancing Solomon Islands’ riskmanagement capacity. The key pillars of disaster risk management, before the event, include:


undertaking a risk assessment; at the national level, building ex-ante resilience entails identifying
risks and explicitly integrating them into the fiscal frameworks and budget planning. This should be
achieved by incorporating the projected fiscal costs of climate change and natural disasters into
annual budgets within a medium-term framework;



providing self-insurance by building policy and financial buffers to enhance resilience to shocks.
Although the current level of macroeconomic buffers is adequate, in recent budgets 0.1-0.25
percent of GDP were put aside for natural disasters purposes only. In addition to accumulating
reserves and maintaining fiscal space (keeping debt low), buffers could be accumulated also in the
National Transport Fund, a donor-financed infrastructure fund fully integrated in the budget;



reducing risks by enhancing preparedness, including by investing in “smart” infrastructure that can
better cope with climate change and natural hazards and by enhancing debt-management capacity;



transferring risk, either through catastrophic sovereign insurance or other newly created subregional schemes (i.e., “Emergency and Stabilization Fund for Melanesian Countries”).

20.
Ex-post disaster risk management includes strategies to manage the impact of a disaster
and facilitate a rapid recovery. At the national level, the main actions include emergency response
and reconstruction efforts. A sound reconstruction program should consist of measures to reduce such
risks through resettlement away from the coastline, where feasible, and infrastructure investment.
Reconstruction can serve to accelerate broader growth-enhancing structural reforms. Donor financing
will remain important in enhancing the ability to cope as these countries are too small, and the costs
too high, to be fully internalized by building buffers.
Authorities’ Views
21.
The authorities agreed with the multi-pillar approach proposed by staff. The government is
currently setting up a contingency fund for natural disasters. It seeks to reduce risks by enhancing
preparedness, including by investing in resilient infrastructure and by enhancing debt-management
capacity.
22.
Regional solutions to transfer risks are also being considered. Solomon Islands decided to
withdraw from the third and final pilot of the Pacific Catastrophe Risk Insurance for the Pacific islands, a
joint initiative led by the World Bank Group with financial support from Japan, because it did not qualify
for payout during the 2014 floods as disbursements are linked to specific physical parameters (e.g. the
wind speed triggering a cyclone) that were not triggered despite the massive floods. The authorities are

considering whether to participate in the newly proposed Melanesian Emergency and Stabilization Fund
(around US$500 million), covering not only natural disasters as well as also other macroeconomic
shocks with balance-of-payment impact, and is meant to provide immediate liquidity ahead of support
from the international financial institutions.

mainly to the central bank, commercial banks, and NPF, and additional scheduled amortization (totaling
SI$147 million or 1.6 percent of GDP).
25.
The small deficit in 2015 relative to 2014 was driven by higher non-tax revenue (1.3
percent of GDP). On the expenditure side, after a slow start due to delays in passing the budget until
April, the pace of both recurrent spending and development spending picked up in the second half of
the year. Implementation of government-funded development spending—a substantial part of which is
constituency development funds (CDFs)—was far higher (4 percent of GDP) than in 2014 in line with the
larger share of this spending in the 2015 budget.
26.
In terms of spending composition, the 2015
budget and outturn include a higher share of capital
spending. In 2014 capital spending amounted to
5.2 percent of GDP, while in 2015, it reached 7.8 percent,
of which 35 percent was in constituency funds.

implies a sharp decline in cash reserve (to SI$197
million). However, revenue projections are very conservative, with a drop of 3.3 percentage points of
GDP (excluding grants) relative to the 2015 outturn, and upside surprises may occur, especially in nontax revenues. Based on more realistic revenue projections as well as assuming an 85 percent
implementation rate of government-funded recurrent spending and a 90 percent implementation rate
of government-funded development spending (in line with recent experience), the actual deficit will
likely be closer to 1.5 percent of GDP, with the cash balance at SI$544 million at the end of 2016.

including to natural disasters. While the increase in spending for capital investment to upgrade
infrastructure and improve health and education outcomes is welcomed, the pace and scale of spending
needs to be made consistent over the medium term with the country’s absorptive capacity, the revenue
envelope, and the availability of financing. It should also reflect realistic plans for revenue mobilization.
The rate of drawdown in the cash balance implied by the 2016 budget should be contained as well as
the pace of spending. Improving the quality of public spending and using the cash balance wisely are
paramount in view of the uncertain growth prospects and vulnerability to natural disasters and other
external shocks.
29.
Given the increase in fiscal risks with regard to the implementation of the 2016 budget,
staff’s specific recommendations included:


urging the authorities to preserve cash reserves as a buffer against natural disasters and other
shocks and to keep total reserves (including the consolidated cash balance) at no less than two
months of total spending to anchor fiscal plans in the near term. This will imply keeping the total
cash balance at a minimum of SI$595 million at end 2016. Going forward, greater attention must
be paid to cash management particularly to cash flow forecasting. More accurate cash flow
forecasting would also improve the analytical value of the mid-year budget review which
currently evaluates inflows and spending relative to a standard assumption of equal monthly
proportions, despite historical data that shows seasonality for some receipts and spending;



re-iterating the importance of using the budget as a tool to anchor fiscal planning and
emphasizing the need for fiscal consolidation beginning 2017. Staff stressed that unrealistic
budget projections are counterproductive—and jeopardize the external financing so critical for
supporting the country’s economic development plans;



stressing the importance and urgency of improving budget presentation and reporting on budget
execution by continuing PFM reforms. The latter will be key to assess the quality of public
spending. For example, while the 2015 budget appropriately allocated more spending to capital
projects, given the large infrastructure needs; however, the budget outturn does not report to
the public the implementation of capital spending. A clearer identification of capital spending,
which is now reported under both recurrent and development spending, will also better
highlight government priorities;



urging continued efforts to improve the quality of public spending including strengthening the
accountability of constituency funds. While this expenditure item meant to provide public service
delivery to a broad spectrum of the population, it is important to ensure that the rate of return
on this spending is higher than the opportunity costs of building buffers by enhancing its
quality and accountability. The mission provided suggestions for a simple supplement to the
development budget that would describe for each constituency fund the planning processes,
development achievements, and future plans for CDF use. Providing this information in publicly
available documents is important as these funds are viewed by the government as one of the
major tools to support rural development;



welcoming the authorities’ intention to scale up infrastructure investment to support higher and
inclusive growth, given the large infrastructure gap. The National Transport Fund is an important
vehicle for investing in infrastructure, with the authorities’ plans on the driving seat.



stressing the need to strengthen revenue mobilization (including non-tax revenue), including by
leveraging technical assistance where possible. This will be key to financing infrastructure
spending and preserving debt sustainability. Exemption will also need to be streamlined as the
revenue base will narrow with the depletion of the forests for logging.



advising the authorities to anchor fiscal plans over the medium-long term to a non-commodity
primary deficit target of 2.5 percent of GDP. This will help manage revenue volatility including
from natural disasters and promote fiscal sustainability. Realistic spending plans should also be
pursued by sequencing development projects within a medium-term fiscal framework to
carefully align resources with spending capacity; and



highlighting the importance of incorporating risks associated with natural disasters and climate
change into the macro framework and DSA to enhance risk assessment ex ante, in line with the
government’s priorities.

30.
The mission strongly welcomed the authorities’ intention to establish quarterly internal
fiscal targets when the ECF-supported program expires. These targets will help preserve fiscal
buffers and better calibrate spending plans (see paragraph 33 below and paragraph 11 of the MEFP).
31.
Fiscal space has been rebuilt and Solomon Islands has one of the lowest debt levels
among peers and non-peers—at 10.4 percent of GDP. Yet, the DSA suggests that Solomon Islands
continues to face a moderate risk of debt distress, consistent with the 2013 assessment in light of its
vulnerability to external shocks and need to scale up infrastructure spending to finance development.
Although there is no breach of debt sustainability thresholds under the baseline, under some alternative
scenarios, thresholds are breached, notably the thresholds for the present value of government debt
relative to exports and GDP. The authorities should be cautious in resuming concessional financing.
Total public debt rises above the threshold in the extreme permanent low growth scenario. The analysis
highlights Solomon Islands’ ongoing vulnerability to external risks and heavy reliance on imports and
aid. Staff included in the baseline 0.2 percent of GDP as recurrent spending and 0.3 percent as
development spending as mitigation costs to natural disasters and tailored an extreme-weather-event
scenario. On the upside, the country’s debt management framework and capacity are strong, thanks to
a series of PFM reforms as indicated in the MEFP (paragraph 13).

Authorities’ Views
32.
The authorities remain committed to maintaining fiscal discipline and a strong cash
reserve after the IMF-supported program expires (MEFP paragraph 11). They intend to target the
broad definition of cash balance (cash balance plus the reserves in the government consolidated
deposit account equivalent to SI140 million) at no less than two months total spending. In addition as
the ECF arrangement expires, the authorities are planning to put in place internal quarterly fiscal targets,
similar to the one set in the past with the IMF, to lock in gains in terms of fiscal management achieved
over the last few years.
33.
The authorities are strongly committed to further strengthening PFM measures. Actions
include: the implementation of the PFM Roadmap, including finalizing the draft Procurement Rules and
Regulations as well as other implementing instructions for the 2013 PFM Act. The authorities are
considering requesting assistance from PFTAC to improve cash flow forecasting and management.
34.
The authorities concur with the importance of strengthening the fiscal framework. They
are open minded on the use over the medium term of the non-commodity balance as a fiscal anchor to
help manage volatility of revenues and ensure a smooth path of infrastructure spending to support
rural development. They asked the mission team to continue to work together with their staff over the
next few months to further discuss the choice of a fiscal anchor also in the context of building resilience
to natural disasters.

The monetary transmission mechanism
remains weak amid high excess liquidity. The CBSI currently uses its own debt instruments—Bokolo
bills—as a tool to manage banking sector liquidity but issuance has been sufficient to absorb only a
portion of the excess liquidity in the system. Bokolo bill auctions were conducted on a fortnightly basis
and the amount floated was kept at SI$355 million per auction throughout the year. While there was
evidently an appetite for increased Bokolo bills from the commercial banks, particularly following the
18

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

SOLOMON ISLANDS

takeover of Westpac by Bank South Pacific (BSP), it was decided that any excess liquidity that the banks
held should be directed to private sector lending. Efforts to promote interbank lending and the
establishment of a repo facility were also explored. As for Treasury bills, which are also administered by
the CBSI on behalf of the government, the cap on the outstanding stock remained at SI$40 million
throughout 2015.
37.
The basket peg regime has worked more effectively since the removal of the operational
1 percent band around the exchange rate against the US dollar in September 2014, and the
widening of the bid offer spread. The basket peg has allowed the SI dollar to weaken against the US
dollar by 10 percent since then along with other currencies in the region. The Solomon Islands dollar
appreciated by 12 percent against the Australian dollar over the same period, reflecting the
strengthening of the US dollar against most currencies. In real effective terms, the exchange rate has
been stable since the removal of the band (Box 3). Communication to the public on exchange rate
policy has been strengthened by publishing the basket rate on the CBSI website. This has helped
promote stability of the trade weighted index, despite some volatility.
Since September 2014, the SI dollar has depreciated vis-àvis the US$ and appreciated vis-à-vis the Australian $

Staff Views
38.
Excess liquidity has not fed into higher inflation, but credit growth has picked up strongly
over the past two years and the authorities should begin mopping up excess liquidity. Staff’s
econometric analysis suggests that credit growth of 10 percent could increase inflation by
0.6 percentage point within a year. The CBSI could use the CRR (cash reserve requirement) ratio to
manage bank liquidity, and treat the level of excess liquidity more explicitly as a quantitative target.
While increasing the CRR alone will not be sufficient to mop up excess liquidity completely, in
combination with reforming the NPF (see paragraph 51), it could help the CBSI gain traction in liquidity
management.
39.
While the basket regime is working well, it can be made more flexible through a periodic
review and adjustment of the appropriateness of level of the peg to ensure it remains supportive
of competitiveness and economic growth. An assessment of external balance suggests that the

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

19

SOLOMON ISLANDS

exchange rate may already be somewhat overvalued (Box 3). While more closely tracking the exchange
rate basket has slowed down the erosion of competitiveness from the appreciation of the US dollar, it
has not addressed the overvaluation of the exchange rate that was carried over from the previous
regime (i.e., when the currency was closely pegged to the dollar). It will also not prevent future real
appreciation, caused by underlying inflation differentials. To avoid this and correct for the overvaluation,
the CBSI should periodically review the level of the exchange rate and adjust its level if necessary. With
China being the most important export market, the authorities should consider including the renminbi
in the basket.
Authorities’ Views
40.
On monetary policy, with regard to using the CRR ratio as a tool to manage liquidity, the CBSI
expressed concern that not all banks are in a position to shoulder the additional burden of a higher
CRR. Technical assistance on how to conduct liquidity swaps is being provided by the Reserve Bank of
Australia.
41.
On exchange rate policy, the CSBI noted that the effective implementation of the basket
peg has allowed some flexibility to absorb external shocks, thus reducing the burden on
monetary policy. The authorities noted that the rise in inflation was driven by the depreciation of the
Solomon Islands dollar. They did not rule out devaluation in the future and indicated that they would
monitor competitiveness indicators to identify situations where the strength of the exchange rate might
be acting as a drag on growth. They also plan to keep the composition of the basket under review and
consider later this year whether to include the renminbi in the basket.

D. Toward Greater Financial Development, Stability, and Inclusion
42.
Despite progress, the domestic financial sector remains underdeveloped, and the reach of
financial service providers has been limited. According to a comprehensive index of financial
development constructed by staff—applying a methodology pioneered by Čihák and others (2012)—
that combines indicators of financial depth, access, and efficiency for financial institutions and markets,
Solomon Islands has lagged small states peers in financial development (but not other low-incomecountries).
According to staff’s newly constructed index, Solomon
Islands lags most peers in financial development…

The limited size of commercial bank deposits relative to GDP also places Solomon Islands among the
most underbanked countries of small states. Other measures of financial inclusion also point to limited
access to financial services (Figure 2).
43.
The financial sector has a simple structure but is beset with inefficiencies. These reflect the
small domestic market, inadequate infrastructure, the difficulty of securing collateral due to communal
land ownership, and generally high transaction costs. Interest rate spreads have long been the highest
among small states in the Pacific. The financial sector consists of two major foreign commercial banks,
one domestic bank, a non-bank financial institution), and a saving and retirement fund—NPF, a
systemically important financial institution with a large share of its assets held as deposits in the
banking system.5 The impact of de-risking on costs of sending remittances has started to emerge with a
few small money transfer operators having ceased operations. However, the impact of these closures is
not as large as in other Pacific Islands.
44.
The CBSI has been proactive in promoting financial inclusion. In 2014, together with
commercial banks, the CBSI introduced mobile banking services to deepen financial access in
geographically dispersed and remote areas, making Solomon Islands a leader in mobile banking
services among Pacific small states, with mobile banking well positioned to leapfrog conventional
banking in providing financial services. The government’s national financial inclusion target for 2015 of
opening 70,000 new bank accounts was met ahead of time, as was the subsequently revised target of
160,000. In February 2016, the National Financial Taskforce, chaired by the Governor of the CBSI,
endorsed Solomon Islands’ National Financial Inclusion Strategy (NFIS) for 2016–20. The strategy will
introduce new financial inclusion targets for the upcoming years and promote higher usage of financial
services.

the CBSI approved the plans of the Australian bank, Westpac, to sell its Solomon Islands operations to
the PNG Bank South Pacific (BSP). As a result, the total number of banks is reduced from four to three.
The increase in BSP’s market share has significantly increased market concentration in the banking
sector as measured by the Herfindahl-Hirschman Index (HHI), from an average of 30 percent to 40
percent, with 100 percent being a monopoly.6

Efforts to increase financial development
and inclusion to promote growth are important
and will need to be balanced against the need to

that the potential positive effect on growth of
further financial development is substantial, even
when compared to other small states. However,
while an increase in access to financial services can
support growth, promote inclusion, and reduce
inequality, a rapid rise in access to credit
unaccompanied by adequate strengthening in
financial supervision can undermine financial
stability.

While mortgage financing and consumption loans have been the main drivers of credit

proposed land reform under the MTDP is a key step in this context.

49.
The financial sector reform agenda continues to be critical for inclusive growth. Efforts
should continue towards introducing a new Credit Unions Act and a new Financial Institutions Act to
promote financial sector stability and development. The new National Provident Fund bill should be
introduced promptly to improve the NPF governance and investment framework, and safeguard
retirement savings. These reforms could also help reduce the excess liquidity in the financial system as
7

the NPF could channel funds currently kept in low-yield domestic deposits into assets with higher rates
of return. Equally important is the proposal to reduce the portion of retirement savings that could be
used as collateral against personal loans, which will help safeguard retirement savings. The NPF should
also regularly conduct actuarial assessments to gauge and ensure the sustainability of the pension
system. See Box 1 for further financial sector reforms.
50.
The CBSI has established good practices in financial transparency and accountability with
the financial statements prepared and audited in accordance with international standards
published on the CBSI website. A new law for the CBSI, enacted in 2012, provides adequate financial
and legal autonomy. Improvements are needed in oversight by the Audit Committee with the addition
of a financial expert. Strengthening staff capacity in the internal audit function is needed for the
development of a risk-based audit function.
Authorities’ Views
51.
The authorities agree on the importance of balancing financial inclusion against financial
stability. They reiterated that financial inclusion is at the top of the government development agenda.
They pointed out that credit access remains low, with only 3.8 percent of adults currently with formal or
informal credit accounts, and that the NFIS only targets a modest 10 percent of adults having access to
credit by 2020. Any negative impact of the recent banking sector consolidation will be limited as the
high spread in interest rate is caused by structural factors. Moreover, product substitutability among
banks will ensure that interest rates remain competitive.
52.
The authorities agree on the need for a new National Provident Fund Act that will help
improve the long-term financial viability and reduce the financial risks of the NPF. The Ministry of
Finance is currently preparing a policy paper to seek Cabinet approval of drafting instructions for a new
NPF bill (paragraph 19, MEFP). The authorities have also endorsed the recommendations of the last IMF
safeguard assessment (paragraph 20 of the MEFP).

E. Engagement with Donors and Other Issues
53.
Financial and technical assistance from development partners will continue to be key to
support development. The annual aid envelope from Australia, the single largest aid donor, is
A$35 million. Despite RAMSI winding down in 2017, the bilateral envelope will continue to be
substantial. Annual bilateral ODA from New Zealand amounts about to NZ$28 million. Assistance has
been focusing on health, economic development and education. The World Bank Group anticipate
approving a US$2.5 million energy access project in April and expect to disburse approximately US$10
million across its portfolio (energy, rural development, environment and fisheries) across 2016. The
European Union approved a national grant allocation of EUR 40 million for the period to 2020 focusing
on Water, Sanitation and Hygiene (WASH) and Rural Development. In addition, it currently provides
sector budget support in Rural WASH of about EUR 2.5 million per year, for the next four years. This
depends on four general eligibility criteria, among which progress in PFM, and sectoral performance
indicators. The Asian Development Bank (ADB) is expected to provide in 2016 US$5 million of budget
support as grants, and US$21 million as loans to finance infrastructure projects under the sustainable
Transport Infrastructure Improvement Program in the second quarter of 2016. The Japan International
Cooperation Agency (JICA) together with the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs supports a variety of
24

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

SOLOMON ISLANDS

multi-year development projects, including the upgrading of the port and road network in the capital,
and waste management, energy infrastructure, education and public health projects across the country.
While some of this support is channeled through the IFIs, JICA’s direct support has a large grant
component with the budgeted amount totaling around US$40 million so far for 2015-17. Solomon
Islands has adequate capacity to repay the Fund and the ECF arrangement remains fully financed.
54.
The authorities also plan to leverage improvements in the area of national statistics to
boost their capacity to assess and forecast macroeconomic developments. The recent Household
Income and Expenditure Survey (HIES) published last October, will pave the way for updating the
composition of the consumer basket and the development of a national CPI―in 2017—as the current
CPI only reflects Honiara prices only. The HIES data is currently being used to analyze poverty and the
results will be released by end of the first quarter 2016. In 2018, the National Statistical Office also
plans to use the HIES findings to rebase GDP statistics to better reflect the current structure of the
economy. Over the long term, the National Statistics Development Strategy (2015‒35)—planned for
Cabinet endorsement in early 2016—identifies priorities and actions to be implemented in an effort to
create a robust, sustainable, and well-coordinated national statistical system.

STAFF APPRAISAL
55.
The program objectives to enhance macroeconomic stability and fiscal and monetary
institutions have been achieved. Solomon Islands has made considerable gains in terms of
macroeconomic stability over the last few years thanks to the structural benchmarks under the ECF
arrangement. Strong fiscal and external reserve buffers have been rebuilt thanks to a strengthening of
the macroeconomic framework, which helped catalyzed donor support. Important reforms have been
implemented: notably, PFM reforms (a new Public Financial Management Act, related draft
implementing instructions and draft procurement instructions, and a new debt management
framework—and related SOE borrowing and guarantee policies—to strengthen debt management
capacity and sustainability); and among others the new Central Bank Act to enhance the effectiveness of
monetary policy. Thanks to these structural measures policy space has been rebuilt and public debt at
10.5 percent is one of the lowest among small states. The authorities remain fully committed to
continuing the process of strengthening institutions that have been guided by the structural
benchmarks under the ECF arrangement.
56.
Solomon Islands faces long-term development challenges as well as opportunities.
Tapping opportunities requires a comprehensive strategy involving both the public and the private
sector. In the new National Development Strategy (NDS), the authorities have identified five specific
development objectives and aligned them to corresponding Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).
The authorities’ Medium-Term Development Plan (MTDP) for 2016-20 sets out plans to achieve the
objectives of the NDS, including details of specific policies and projects and public expenditure
prioritization.
57.
Investing in resilience to enhance preparedness to natural disasters entails a multi-pillar
strategy at the national, regional, and multilateral levels. It requires enhancing the country’s riskmanagement capacity. Staff encourages the authorities to incorporate the costs of natural disasters into
the multi-year fiscal framework and support the plan to create a contingency fund for natural disasters.

58.
With the uncertainty regarding future sources of economic growth and a challenging
external outlook, fiscal space should be preserved in implementing the 2016 budget and in outer
years. As the program with the IMF expires, progress achieved in ensuring macroeconomic stability will
need to be locked in by maintaining a healthy fiscal position and fiscal buffers given the country’s
vulnerability to external shocks, including from terms of trade, climate change, and natural disasters.
59.
We urge the authorities to keep cash reserves at a minimum of two months of total
spending and to strictly prioritize spending. As in 2015, the 2016 budget document presents an
expansionary budget deficit of 5.7 percent of GDP. In the staff assessment, the budget deficits should
be not higher than 1.5 percent of GDP and the cash balance not lower than 2 month of total spending
in order to be consistent with the commitments of the authorities in the MEFP.
60.
Measures to improve the quality of public spending are essential for enhancing resilience
and support rural development. To this end, PFM reforms that strengthen the accountability of public
resources, including the constituency funds, should be accelerated.
61.
The authorities should sustain their efforts to implement reforms to build sound fiscal
institutions. These include improving the quality of public spending by implementing public finance
management reforms, including by enhancing the transparency and accountability of tertiary
scholarship and constituency funds; and mobilizing additional revenues by strengthening tax
compliance and streamlining exemptions in order to finance infrastructure spending while preserving
debt sustainability.
62.
Monetary policy is appropriate but the authorities should remain vigilant. Excess liquidity
in the banking system has not fed into higher inflation, but given high credit growth, the authorities
should start mopping up excess liquidity.
63.
The currency basket regime is now working well. The basket peg is an appropriate exchange
rate regime for Solomon Islands but the level of the exchange rate should be assessed periodically and
if necessary, adjusted, to ensure that it remains supportive of competitiveness and economic growth.
The inclusion of the renminbi should be considered given China is the first export market for Solomon
Islands.
64.
The financial system is sound, and efforts to strengthen supervisory and regulatory
frameworks should continue. A new NPF Act will be important for strengthening the NPF’s
governance framework and investment regime as to safeguard the retirement savings of the
population. Other financial sector reforms include the introduction of a new Credit Unions Act and a
new Financial Institutions Act. Efforts to promote financial inclusion are commendable especially in
deepening financial access in rural areas and should continue. Solomon Islands has become a leader in
mobile banking services among the Pacific islands.
65.
Based on the Solomon Islands’ program performance, staff recommends the completion
of the fifth and sixth reviews under the ECF-supported program. The completion of the fifth and
sixth reviews will enable the release of the sixth and seventh disbursements in the amount of SDR
297,145.
66.
With the ECF arrangement expiring, it is proposed that the next Article IV consultation
take place on a 12-month cycle.

A vector error correction model (VECM) that quantifies both the long- and short- run impacts suggests that
growth spillovers from China to Solomon Islands are significant and persistent up to three quarters. In the long
run, the Johansen test suggests that there is cointegrated relationship between GDP in these two countries. In
the short run, spillover from China’s growth to Solomon Islands is also significant.
Downside scenario
The model shows that if China’s growth rate is 1.5 percentage points lower (y/y) than the current WEO baseline
during 2016Q1-2020Q4, the negative impact on Solomon Islands will be 0.4 percentage point per year over the
same period (based on Eri Ikeda, Patrizia Tumbarello, and Yiqun Wu, forthcoming IMF working paper: “Growth

Better infrastructure investment is also essential, particularly in communication and energy and to build resilience
against natural disasters to help businesses and rural areas recover rapidly. This requires strengthening fiscal policy
frameworks (i.e. PFM). The option of a one-off adjustment in the level of the basket peg should remain under
consideration if competitiveness needs to improve and to respond to international monetary developments
impacting Solomon Islands. Such developments include volatility in the US dollar as the Federal reserve exits
quantitative easing, and in the renminbi, as China targets a broader currency basket and eases capital controls.

Appendix I. Solomon Islands––Risk Assessment Matrix1
Shock

Likelihood

Tighter or more volatile global
financial conditions:



Sharp asset price decline and
decompression of credit
spreads



Surge in the US dollar

(i) Medium

(ii) High

Impact

Policy Response

Medium
Continued strengthening of the US
dollar may pose challenges to
effective management of the basket
peg, which may exacerbate real
exchange rate appreciation and
lead to eroding competitiveness.
Failure to manage non-US dollar
reserves adequately may also lead
to significant valuation losses.

Continue effective implementation
of the basket currency peg in line
with IMF TA. Strengthen reserve
management, including through
Fund TA. Over time, seek to realign
the exchange rate with underlying
fundamentals and address
infrastructure bottlenecks to
improve productivity and boost
competitiveness.

Sharper-than-expected global
growth slowdown:




Significant slowdown in other
large EMs/frontier economies
Structurally weak growth in key
advanced and emerging
economies

Medium
While the direct impact is limited,
(i) Medium
Solomon Islands is prone to indirect
effects through regional economies,
(ii) High/Medium
including Australia.

Use policy buffers, including
countercyclical fiscal policy and
international reserves, to cushion
the impact. Over time, diversify
sources of growth.

High
Given the increased trade linkages
with China, Solomon Islands would
be affected by a severe economic
slowdown. Indirect effects via other
regional economies e.g. Australia,
would also have an impact.

Use policy buffers, including
countercyclical fiscal policy and
international reserves, to cushion
the impact. Over time, diversify
sources of growth.

Medium
Persistently lower oil prices have
kept inflationary pressures in check
and deflationary pressures have
been limited.

Take advantage of favorable
conditions to ease the fiscal
adjustment and buy time for
structural reforms to yield results.

Sharp growth slowdown in China:



Insufficient progress with
reforms leads to a continued
buildup of vulnerabilities



Sharp slowdown in 2015-16

Persistently lower energy prices

Adverse effects of El Niño on

Appendix II. Solomon Islands: Authorities’ Response to Fund Policy Advice
Fund Recommendation
Fiscal Policy
Increase fiscal openness, transparency and planning.

Broaden the tax base and increase revenue
transparency.

Policy Actions
In August 2014, the government produced and published a
Budget strategy document. The authorities produced in
2014 a Final Budget Outcome Report (an ECF structural
benchmark), and produced and published a mid-year
Budget review (an ECF structural benchmark).
Amend the Export Duty Schedule (by Ministerial Order) to
complete the implementation of the new mining tax regime
in line with IMF TA recommendations.

Promote transparency and accountability of public
funds.

The Auditor-General conducted an audit of the spending
and project achievements of the constituency development
funds for 2012, and is expected to submit the audit reports
to Parliament during the next sitting of Parliament. On
tertiary education policy, a tertiary education structure has
been proposed and will pave the way to review the tertiary
education policy. A think tank has met and firmed up the
tertiary education structure.

Promote public debt management.

The authorities submitted to Cabinet the on lending and
guarantees instructions under the framework of the Debt
Management Strategy.

Monetary and Financial Sector Policy
Strengthen supervisory and regulatory framework for
the financial system.

The CBSI Act was passed by Parliament in November 2012
to strengthen the monetary policy and supervisory
framework. The Cabinet has also approved the drafting
instructions for a new Financial Institutions Act and started
the process to draft a Credit Unions bill to promote financial
sector stability and development as part of the benchmarks
under the ECF.

Improve operations and financial performance of the
National Provident Fund (NPF).

Cabinet approved in July 2012 draft instructions to revise
the NPF Act to strengthen its governance structure and
investment framework.

Strengthen the monetary transmission mechanism.

In March 2015, in line with IMF TA recommendations, the
CBSI announced its plans to implement a series of
measures—including a potential change in the cash reserve
requirement ratio and introducing a forex swap facility— to
increase the effectiveness of the monetary transmission
mechanism.

Exchange rate policy
Follow the basket peg more closely, including by
widening the operational ±1 percent exchange rate
band removed the vis-à-vis the U.S. dollar and recentering it periodically.

The invoice-based basket peg regime has been fully
implemented and the operational band was removed in
November 2014. As a result, the Solomon Islands dollar has
more closely tracked the value of the basket. The authorities
are considering periodic re-centering, in line with recent TA
recommendations.

Structural policy
Focus on key areas of infrastructure development
and diversifying the sources of growth. Particular
emphasis should be put on access to power,
telecommunications, and transportation

Progress has been slow, hampered by a number of factors,
including the closure of the gold mine, ongoing nickel
mining licensing disputes. However, Tina River Hydropower
Project is expected to get underway in 2017.

Introduce a well-articulated development plan in the
context of a comprehensive Poverty Reduction
Strategy.

A rolling 5-year Medium-Term Development Plan has been
introduced to support the National Development Strategy,

Appendix III. Letter of Intent
Ref: RF457/5/5

March 8, 2016

Madame Christine Lagarde
Managing Director
International Monetary Fund
Washington, DC 20431
Dear Madame Lagarde:
As a small island state, Solomon Islands faces considerable development challenges arising from its
smallness, remoteness, and dispersion. It also remains vulnerable to external shocks and natural
disasters. At the same time, we are convinced that our country has great potential and that
appropriate policies and stronger institutional capacity will help overcome some of our development
challenges and achieve higher economic growth.
Solomon Islands has greatly benefited from the partnership with the IMF in implementing our
government’s economic reform program, supported by a three-year Extended Credit Facility (ECF)
arrangement approved in December 2012. Fiscal and external buffers have been rebuilt and
important reforms—relating to public financial management (PFM) and the financial sector--are
being implemented.
In terms of recent program performance, all end-December 2014 performance criteria (PCs), endMarch 2015 indicative targets (ITs), end-June 2015 PCs and end-September 2015 ITs have been
achieved by a considerable margin, with the exception of the ITs on government-funded recurrent
spending on health and education, which were narrowly missed. We have also made progress in
implementing the structural benchmarks. Therefore, we request the completion of the fifth and sixth
(final) reviews, and the sixth and seventh disbursements, under the ECF arrangement, each in the
amount of SDR 0.149 million (US$ 0.2 million).
The attached Memorandum of Economic and Financial Policies (MEFP) describes our government’s
reform policies. We believe these policies have, and will continue to, strengthen our macroeconomic
framework and public institutions. The reform agenda aims to promote growth and improve the
composition of public spending.
We intend to maintain our constructive engagement with the IMF, and we stand ready to take
additional measures, as appropriate, to ensure the achievement of the government’s objectives
under the ECF arrangement. We will consult with the Fund in advance of adopting these measures, or
on any revisions to the policies laid out in the MEFP, in accordance with the Fund’s policy on such
consultation. Furthermore, we will provide the Fund with any appropriate information it may request
on policy implementation, as necessary, to achieve the program objectives.

SOLOMON ISLANDS

Attachment. Memorandum of Economic and Financial Policies
1.
Solomon Islands has made considerable progress toward achieving macroeconomic
stability and implementing structural reforms since the approval of the current three-year
Extended Credit Facility (ECF) arrangement on December 7, 2012. In the process, we have also
benefited from several IMF technical assistance missions, with the intensive involvement of PFTAC in
a wide range of areas: statistics, fiscal policy, public financial management (PFM), exchange rate
management, monetary operations, and the financial sector. The ECF program has been instrumental
in anchoring government policies, strengthening institutional capacity, and catalyzing donor
support. Fiscal and external buffers have been rebuilt also thanks to the structural benchmarks
implemented under the ECF-supported program. Net international reserves rose to 9.8 months of
imports in December 2015 from 7.8 months at the start of the ECF program, and external public debt
has dropped to 9.8 percent of GDP from 12.7 percent over the same period. We are implementing
important reforms—notably in PFM and the financial sector. We are mindful that these and other
structural reform efforts need to be accelerated to make Solomon Islands more resilient to shocks
and improve the well being of its population.

RECENT DEVELOPMENTS, OUTLOOK, AND RISKS
2.
After slowing in 2014, owing to the floods, real growth has picked up again. It is
expected to have reached 3.25 percent in 2015, reflecting strength in the forestry sector and the
windfall to consumers and producers from lower oil prices. However, the impact of Cyclone Raquel,
which hit parts of the country in July 2015, damaged food production of subsistence farmers in some
remote areas. In addition, the ongoing El Niño event-- linked to incidents of drought in the
country—appears to be weakening agricultural output and it is contributing to raise food prices
toward the end of the year. Nonetheless, the external position has strengthened and net
international reserves rose to US$506 million at the end of December, thanks to strong log exports
and donor support.
3.
Growth in 2016 is expected to remain at 3.2 percent, but risks are tilted toward the
downside. The likelihood of reopening the Gold Ridge mine remains small. El Niño could continue
to weight on agricultural output and fishery sector in 2016. At the same time, downside risks to the
regional outlook have increased, particularly for emerging markets, which are major trade partners
for Solomon Islands. And the logging industry is expected to decline over the medium term. These
all point to the need for new sources of growth, including from manufacturing and tourism.
Investment in infrastructure will be essential to support rural development as well as private sector
development and raise productivity across a wider range of sectors.

PROGRAM PERFORMANCE
4.
Quantitative targets have been met under the ECF program. All end-December 2014
performance criteria (PCs), end-March 2015 indicative targets (ITs), end-June 2015 PCs , and endSeptember 2015 ITs were all met by a considerable margin, except for the ITs on the governmentfunded recurrent spending on health and education, which were narrowly missed (Table 2). Cash
balance increased from SI$880 at end December 2014 to SI$1,055 million in June 2015 (well above
the program target of SI$545 million) as government-funded development spending was held back
44

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

SOLOMON ISLANDS

by the delay in approval of the 2015 budget. By end September 2015 it decreased to SI$893 million
owing to a pick-up in government-funded development spending, but is still significantly above the
end-September IT of SI $535 million, declining further to SI$694 million at end December 2015, after
the prepayment of $99.5million in domestic debt as well as SI$48 million of scheduled amortization.
The ITs on government-funded recurrent spending on health and education were narrowly missed,
owing to stronger procurement requirements by development partners in disbursing ODA.
5.
Despite delays, the country has also made progress with structural reform (Table 1)
and with legislative reforms in the context of the program’s structural benchmarks. We have
obtained Cabinet’s approval in February of the policy paper regarding the forthcoming Credit Unions
bill—(September 2015 benchmark) which we now expect to be sent to the Attorney General by
March 2016. We are currently preparing a submission to Cabinet seeking approval, expected by endMarch 2016 for the Attorney General’s Chambers to proceed with the drafting of the new National
Provident Fund bill based on the previously approved drafting instructions. We plan to table this bill
before Parliament by September 2016. We have obtained Cabinet’s approval in February 2016 for the
Attorney General’s Chambers to vet the new Customs and Excise bill before it is tabled in Parliament
by September 2016 (also an end-September 2015 benchmark). But given continued capacity
constraints in the Attorney General’s Chambers and the complexity of these legislations, we expect a
slower pace of progress at the next stage of the legislative process.
6.
We are strongly committed to further strengthening PFM measures in the pipeline. We
are fully aware that strong PFM is critical to improving the quality of public spending and are fully
committed to the PFM Roadmap (2014-17) and the priorities identified. Regarding the issuance (by
Ministerial Order) of the implementing regulations on the implementation of the Constituency
Development Funds Act, in accordance with the PFM Act, the Government’s approach has changed.
It will now progress the fiscal and public financial management commitments through implementing
the PFM Roadmap, including finalizing the draft Procurement Rules and Regulations. The new
procurement regulations are scheduled to come into effect on July 1, 2016 or earlier. Regarding the
release to public of the results of the audits conducted by the office of the Auditor General on the
spending of the Constituency Development Funds in 2012, it is expected that the Auditor General
will submit the audit reports to Parliament during the Parliament sitting of July 2016 (end-June 2015
structural benchmark).
7.
We have sustained our efforts to strike a better balance between financing tertiary
education and primary education. We are finalizing the review of our policies on tertiary education
to ensure an adequate balance of spending between primary and tertiary education and also to
obtain Cabinet approval of revamped policies for tertiary scholarships. A tertiary education structure
has been proposed and will pave the way to review the tertiary education policy (March 2015
structural benchmark). A think tank has met and firmed up the tertiary education structure.
Regarding revamping policies for tertiary education, while progress has been made, the process has
been longer than expected. The government is preparing a new Education bill which should be ready
in the first half of 2016 and will carefully revisit this matter once the bill is ready.
8.
In addition to progress on structural reform anchored by the structural benchmarks,
we are taking major steps to tackle corruption. Solomon Islands acceded to the UN Convention

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

45

SOLOMON ISLANDS

against Corruption (UNCAC) in 2012. This government has put fighting corruption at the top of the
political agenda. We recognize the economic costs of corruption and are taking steps to strengthen
the anti-corruption framework, including by adopting a national anti-corruption strategy and
establishing an independent anti-corruption commission. An anti-corruption bill is expected to be
completed by the first quarter of 2016. The Anticorruption Bill is being accompanied by the Whistle
Blower Bill and a revamped Ombudsman Bill. The object of the Anti-Corruption Bill is to give
legislative effect to the United Nations Convention Against Corruption by:


prohibiting corruption in the public and private sectors;



providing for the investigation and punishment of corruption offences;



establishing the Solomon Islands Independent Commission Against Corruption; and other
legal and institutional mechanisms;



making related provisions; and



to effectively combat corruption in Solomon Islands in all its aspects in both the public and
private sectors.

9.

To achieve these objects the bill will:


give legislative effect in Solomon Islands to certain provisions of the Convention (UNCAC)
that are binding on the Government;



establish the Solomon Islands Independent Commission Against Corruption (SIICAC) with
preventive, investigative and prosecution powers;



reaffirm the continuing role of the Government in the fight against corruption with the
publication/implementation of a national Anti-Corruption Strategy; and,



provide other legal and institutional mechanisms which strengthen the regulatory framework
and the capacity to detect, investigate and prosecute corruption effectively.

PROGRAM POLICIES
Fiscal Policy
10.
Our fiscal position has strengthened under the ECF program, although more recently
spending has accelerated to support rural development. Despite having projected a large deficit
in the 2015 budget under full implementation, the budget deficit turned out to be smaller owing to
spending capacity constraints and the delay in passing the 2015 budget.
11.
As the IMF-supported program expires, we are committed to maintaining a strong cash
reserve and preserve fiscal discipline. We remain committed to preserving a sustainable fiscal
position while providing resources to support economic growth and much-needed social spending.
In 2016, we will achieve a sustainable fiscal balance. We will put in place quarterly fiscal targets to
limit fiscal risks by ensuring that the cash balance does not fall below two months of total
expenditure in 2016 onwards as defined in the consolidated budget (government-funded
development spending plus total recurrent spending). This will be achieved by keeping expenditure
flows closely in line with domestic revenue collection. We will continue to assess whether this anchor
is adequate enough to manage fiscal risks to the budget, including those related to climate change
and other shocks both in the short and medium-term.

46

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

SOLOMON ISLANDS

12.
We are undertaking additional measures to complement PFM reforms already in the
pipeline under the ECF program to enhance budget presentation and improving the quality of
public spending. We will review the spending mix in the 2016 budget in the mid-year budget review
and realigning public spending with our development priorities, including through the
implementation of much-needed capital projects. As part of the implementation of the PFM Act, we
will continue to prepare and publish a mid-year budget review and adjust spending plans in the
short and medium term to make them consistent with revenues. Going forward, we remain
committed to strengthening budget presentation to ensure broader understanding of the cost
effectiveness of spending. This will imply a better integration of budgeting and planning. This will
require in the 2017 budget a presentation that clearly identifies within the recurrent and
development expenditure, the capital spending component. The 2015 and 2016 budget outturns will
also report on the implementation of capital spending which has increased under the current
government. In the medium term we also plan to move towards linking budget to outputs and
expenditures in one budget document.
13.
We will seek to mobilize revenues by strengthening tax compliance and streamlining
exemptions. We will submit to Parliament the new Customs and Excise bill (an end-September 2015
structural benchmark), which includes the clauses related to exemptions and the draft amendments
to other revenue acts (i.e., income tax, stamp duties, and goods and sales tax). This process will be
facilitated by the prompt Cabinet approval to send the bill to the Attorney General’s Chambers for
vetting as noted above.
14.
We will exercise caution in resuming concessional borrowing to preserve domestic and
external stability. All proposed new Government borrowings will be assessed against the
Government’s Debt Management Framework (DMF), which comprises of a Debt Management
Strategy, SOE Borrowing Policy, On-lending Policy and Guarantee Policy—all benchmarks achieved
under the ECF-supported program. Legal aspects of the DMF are incorporated in the PFM Act. An
Annual Borrowing Limit of SI$300 million has been set for 2016. This level of borrowing is consistent
with the debt sustainability threshold imposed under the DMF (i.e. face value of debt to GDP of 25
percent).

Policies to Enhance Resilience to Natural Disasters
15.
Enhancing resilience to natural disasters and climate change remains a high priority for
this government. Going forward we will more clearly identify in the budget document total
resources budgeted for natural disasters adaptation and mitigation and integrate them in the DSA.
We will accumulate a specific contingency for natural disasters either in the natural transport fund or
another government contingency fund. We will reduce risks by enhancing preparedness, including by
investing in resilient infrastructure and by enhancing debt-management capacity; We are also
discussing regional solution (Melanesian fund) that could provide limited although immediate
liquidity within one week after the disaster. We will also explore catastrophic insurance schemes.
16.
One of the major issues after disaster strikes is the collection of data from outer
remotest islands due to limited infrastructure connectivity. However, our effort in improving our

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

47

SOLOMON ISLANDS

housing income and expenditure surveys has relieved this issue in order for immediate emergency
disbursements. We recognized though the need for effective emergency response by means of
training and awareness to occur between the National Disaster Council and the Ministry of Finance
for immediate payment process.

Monetary, Exchange Rate, and Financial Sector Policies
17.
Monetary and exchange rate policies have been supportive of economic activity. We
have maintained an accommodative monetary policy stance in light of contained inflationary
pressures amid low global commodity prices. We will pursue measures to reduce excess liquidity in
the financial sector, deepen the foreign exchange market, develop the domestic interbank market,
and ultimately, create an environment in which monetary policy becomes an effective tool for
macroeconomic management.
18.
We continue to see the basket peg exchange rate regime as important for anchoring
inflation and maintaining competitiveness. The removal of the operational 1 percent band around
the base rate in September 2014 has allowed more flexibility of bilateral exchange rates and ensured
that the currency basket remains more stable. Since then, the Solomon Islands dollar has depreciated
against the US$ by around 10 percent, reflecting the strong appreciation of the US dollar against the
Australian dollar and other currencies. Separately, we have also increased the buy-sell margin in
foreign exchange trading to allow greater flexibility in exchange rate management to allow the full
benefits of the basket to be realized. Going forward improvements in the implementation of the
basket regime are warranted. We have started to announce the bilateral rate every day to help keep
the peg constant. We will also review periodically the appropriateness of the level of the peg.
19.
We have sustained our efforts to strengthen financial regulation and supervision to
preserve financial stability and foster financial sector development to promote growth. The
CBSI has been proactive in promoting financial inclusion. In the last two years, together with
commercial banks it introduced mobile banking services to deepen financial access in
geographically dispersed and remote areas, making Solomon Islands a leader in mobile banking
services among Pacific small states, with mobile banking well positioned to leapfrog conventional
banking in providing financial services. We are seeking Cabinet approval to allow the Attorney
General’s Chambers to proceed with the drafting of the revised National Provident Fund (NPF) Act
that strengthens the NPF’s governance structure and investment framework, as well as the draft
Credit Unions Act, which will help promote financial sector stability and development. To
demonstrate our commitment to financial reform, we have included both items in the government’s
legislative agenda for 2016.
20.
We will continue to make progress in implementing the recommendations of the latest
IMF safeguard assessment. In particular the CBSI will continue to recruit and train Internal Audit
Unit staff to strengthen its internal audit function and have an independent quality assurance review
of the Unit within five years.

Sustaining rural development remains high on the reform agenda. Our new Mediumterm Development Plan for 2016-20, approved by Parliament in December 2015, sets out how we
intend to achieve the objectives set out in the National Development Strategy (NDS) for (2016-2035),
including the detailed of specific policies and projects. The NDS identifies selected sustainable
development goals (SDGs): these include: sustained and inclusive economic growth, poverty
alleviation; access to quality social services, resilient and environmental sustainable development,
stable and effective governance and public order. We have submitted this Medium-Term

floor on the program cash balance will be adjusted upward (downward) by the stock of the government treasury bills, excluding restructured government bonds, in excess (short) of the program level; the floor on the program cash balance will be adjusted upward by the balance in the SIG Consolidated Deposits Account
5/ These performance criteria are applicable on a continuous basis.
6/ An indicative target for spending on health and education at no less than 32 percent of government-funded recurrent spending.
7/ The SIG Consolidated Deposits Account functions like a contingency fund for the government and transfers to and from this account can affect the program cash balance. Negative deviations from the projected balance in this account will therefore be used to adjust the program cash balance targets upward.

Exchange Rate Arrangements:
The exchange rate arrangement is a conventional peg. The Solomon Islands dollar is pegged to an
invoice-based basket of currencies consisting of the U.S. dollar (with the weight of 58 percent), the
Australian dollar (32 percent), the New Zealand dollar (5 percent), the Japanese yen (3 percent), and
the British pound (2 percent). The Central Bank of Solomon Islands sets the exchange rate vis-à-vis
the U.S. dollar in such a way as to maintain the value of the basket constant in Solomon Islands
dollars given the movements of currencies in the basket relative to each other. Since the second half
of 2014, exchange rate policy management has aimed to keep the value of the basket stable and to
avoid real exchange rate misalignment stemming from inflation differentials with trading partners.
Solomon Islands maintains an exchange system that is free of restrictions on the making of
payments and transfers for current international transactions. Commercial banks can exchange the
Solomon Islands dollar against other currencies and are free to set the bid-ask spread for all
currencies except the U.S. dollar and Australian dollar on which there is a spread limit of ±20 and
±25 basis points, respectively. In addition, the central bank maintains a standing facility through
which it will buy and sell foreign exchange with commercial banks and the government at spot offer
and sell rates.
Last Article IV Consultation:
The 2013 Article IV Consultation discussions were held in Honiara during October 21–November 1,
2013. The staff report (IMF Country Report No. 14/12) was considered by the Executive Board and
the consultation concluded on January 8, 2014.

SUPPORT FROM THE PACIFIC FINANCIAL TECHNICAL
ASSISTANCE CENTRE1
Solomon Islands: PFTAC Country Strategy 2013–17
Background
The Solomon Islands has recovered well from a precarious position during the global economic
crisis. Growth has accelerated rapidly and international and fiscal reserves increased, on the back of
increased logging and mining, but also due to better fiscal management and increased international
assistance. The medium-term reform agenda under the Core Economic Working Group emphasizes,
amongst other things, strengthening of public financial.
Solomon Islands has been a moderate user of PFTAC TA. Despite the large international
presence, mainly through RAMSI which caters for much of the technical assistance needs in the
government, PFTAC has made specific technical contributions in particular with regard to the fiscal
regime for natural resources. In the PFM area, PFTAC has reviewed and provided suggestions on a
draft PFM law and associated implementing instructions, participated in a PEFA assessment, assisted
in advocating at both political and technical level the PFM Reform Roadmap, and introductory
training on international public sector accounting standards (IPSAS). . Significant amounts of support
have been provided to CBSI in formulating and implementing new prudential regulations for banks
and also in developing a more robust inflation forecasting regime.
Strategy 2013-2017
PFTAC’s TA strategy is guided by the APD regional strategy note and is planned within the ResultsBased Management (RBM) framework for the current PFTAC funding cycle.2 The main focus of PFTAC
TA will be on strengthening fiscal management and solidifying the financial sector. In the
Government area inputs will either be at the strategic/policy level or dealing with niche requirements
where IMF/PFTAC has a comparative advantage. Support for implementation is expected to continue
to come from other donors, in the context of RAMSI or its successor.
In the Public Financial Management area, following on the results from the 2012 PEFA, the main
focus is expected to be assisting the authorities in implementing the PFM Roadmap. Priorities are
likely to be on cash management reform, and finalizing implementing instructions for a PFM law
approved in 2013. The authorities have also requested assistance with improving non-tax revenue
management.

The Pacific Financial Technical Assistance Centre in Suva, Fiji, is a regional technical assistance institution operated
by the IMF with financial support of the Asian Development Bank, Australia, Japan, Korea, and New Zealand. The
Center’s aim is to build skills and institutional capacity for effective economic and financial management that can be
sustained at the national level. Member countries are: Cook Islands, Federated States of Micronesia, Fiji, Kiribati,
Marshall Islands, Nauru, Niue, Palau, Papua New Guinea, Samoa, Solomon Islands, Timor-Leste, Tokelau, Tonga,
Tuvalu, and Vanuatu.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

SOLOMON ISLANDS

In the revenue area, the Solomon Islands continue to receive significant assistance from New
Zealand Inland Revenue Department (NZIRD). This technical assistance, facilitated by the New
Zealand Ministry of Foreign affairs (MFAT), is expected to continue over the next few years. Recent
activities include: (a) the Solomon Islands Inland Revenue Division (SIIRD) undertaking a
comprehensive constraints analysis which provides recommendations to further elevate
organizational performance; and (b) a business process mapping exercise geared towards
streamlining internal processes. SIIRD staff regularly attend PFTAC facilitated training initiatives
under the umbrella of the Pacific Island Tax Administration Association.
In financial sector supervision, making use of PFTAC support provided the CBSI with improved
oversight of the financial institution sector. As a result of extensive assistance over the past years,
supervisors now have the skills and processes in place to effectively carry out on-site examinations of
banking institutions which will, over the next year, result in a more targeted technical assistance from
PFTAC’s on-site examination advisors. Additionally support was provided, in late 2013, to the CBSI
for their successful implementation of the Reserve Bank of New Zealand’s Financial Sector
Information System which resulted in enhanced supervision capabilities. Technical advisory
assistance was recently provided by PFTAC, with the support of the IMF Legal Department, with the
revision of the Credit Union Act. Additional technical assistance will be delivered to the CBSL in 2016
for building credit union financial reporting standards including strengthening the credit union
oversight at the CBSL.
In statistics, PFTAC has provided more frequent assistance to the NSO in recent years. This has
been successful in improving local capacity to compile GDP estimates, exemplified in January 2016
by the NSO’s unaided publication of annual GDP estimates, by production and expenditure, for
2014. The coverage and timeliness of data obtained from the business survey and administrative
sources, including GFS and overseas aid, have also been improved. The main tasks for future TA will
be to assist in rebasing GDP from 2004 to 2012, make further improvements to sources and
methodologies and enhance the analytical capabilities of local compilation staff. PFTAC will also
liaise with an advisor from the Australian Bureau of Statistics who is assisting the NSO in rebasing
and improving the CPI, as had been recommended by an IMF HQ mission in 2012.
In the macroeconomic area, PFTAC is continuing to support the development and use of a financial
programming framework involving staffs from both the Ministry of Finance and CBSI. Going
forward, the task is to progress debt sustainability analysis, which is an important tool for evaluating
and assessing the long-run impact of government policies. Support is also being provided to assist
in the construction of quarterly GDP and an output gap measure to gauge inflationary pressures in
the economy.

RELATIONS WITH THE WORLD BANK GROUP
(As of January 2016)
The Bank and the Fund teams led by Mr. Robert Utz (Lead Economist and Program Leader, World
Bank Sydney Office) and Mrs. Patrizia Tumbarello (IMF Mission Chief for Solomon Islands) maintain a
regular dialogue on macroeconomic and structural issues, as do their respective technical teams. In
recent years, collaborative efforts have focused on the joint Bank-Fund Debt Sustainability Analysis
and regular discussions during missions and at headquarters. Visiting IMF missions regularly meet
Bank staff in their Honiara office, led by Ms. Anne Tully (World Bank Country Representative), and at
headquarters.
The teams agree that the key priorities for Solomon Islands include consolidating the recent
improvement in the country’s macro-fiscal framework in the face of ongoing volatility in external
conditions and heightened levels of planned government spending, improving the quality of public
spending to ensure public resources support the access to basic social services, improving the
investment climate to support business development, and ensuring state-owned enterprises can
sustainably provide public services.
The risks to the economy, from slippages in domestic policy decisions or a deterioration in external
conditions remain considerable. Ongoing efforts to strengthen Solomon Islands’ economic
management and reinforce protective buffers are to be supported, as are efforts to improve the
quality of spending.
The Bank and Fund teams agree that the focus has shifted from post-conflict recovery to the
medium-term reform and growth agenda. Priority issues include developing a more coordinated and
prioritized approach to weaknesses in public financial management systems and ensuring that the
reforms achieved to date are sustained and become regular practice, identifying policy reform
priorities for fostering inclusive growth and reducing hardship, ensuring budget allocations are
better aligned with needs to achieve the priority of improving delivery of social services, and of
strengthening the climate for investments, particularly in the mining sector. Between the Bank and
the Fund, the Bank takes the lead in public expenditure management framework and structural
reform issues, and the Fund will continue to take the lead on macro issues.
The Banks and Fund teams agree to continue close collaboration, mainly with regular contact
through the Bank’s Honiara and Sydney offices, the IMF regional resident representative office in
Suva, and at headquarters. The Fund will also continue to collaborate with the government-donor
Core Economic Working Group convened regularly in Honiara by the Ministry of Finance and
Treasury with World Bank support. Appendix I provides a list of planned activities in the coming year.

RELATIONS WITH THE ASIAN DEVELOPMENT BANK
(As of January 2016)
Since joining the Asian Development Bank (AsDB) in 1973, Solomon Islands has received 19 loans
amounting to US$102.42 million, 11 Asian Development Fund grants amounting to US$81.41 million,
and 73 technical assistance projects amounting to US$25.82 million.
The AsDB’s Country Partnership Strategy (2012–16) was endorsed in March 2012. The strategy seeks
to reduce poverty in line with the government’s national development strategy, 2011–20, by
promoting equitable private sector-led economic growth through assistance in four core areas:
transport; information and communication technology; public sector management; and energy.
Private sector development, capacity development, and the promotion of good governance are
thematic priorities.1 In 2016, the AsDB is beginning the preparation of a new Country Partnership
Strategy which will cover AsDB’s engagement for the 2017–21 period.
In line with improvements in its public debt situation, Solomon Islands’ borrowing status was
changed by the AsDB from grant-only to a 50:50 mix of grants and concessionary loans, as of
1 January 2011.
Transport. Building on AsDB’s existing Transport Sector Development Project, AsDB will continue to
support a sector-wide approach to management and development of a multimodal transport
system. A proposed Sustainable Transport Infrastructure Improvement Program will promote
transport sector development and provide funding to the national transport fund for investment and
capacity development activities according to the National Transport Plan, 2011–30.
Information and communication technology. The Broadband for Development Project, which will
be financed by both sovereign and nonsovereign investments, will deliver good-quality, high-speed
internet services at affordable prices to Solomon Islanders in both urban and rural areas. The original
project was approved in 2012, with additional financing proposed for 2016, once final decisions
around project design are made by the government.
Public sector management. In coordination with development partners and operating through the
Core Economic Working Group, AsDB will continue supporting the government-led public sector
management reforms with policy-based programs. The main goal of AsDB’s assistance in public
sector management is to improve the enabling environment for private-sector led, inclusive growth
and development. A fourth policy-based program grant has been programed by AsDB for 2016. This
follows AsDB’s program grants approved in 2010, 2011, and 2013. AsDB will continue to provide
technical assistance to support public sector management reforms, including commercial legal
reform, state-owned enterprise reform, improving access to finance, and support for the preparation
of a new national development strategy.

Energy. AsDB support will complement the efforts of other partners in energy sector reform through
sustainable off-grid power services. A project to build a small hydropower plant and increase access
to modern energy services was approved in 2014. A solar power development project is planned for
2016, and a further energy project in 2018.
In 2008, AsDB established a development coordination office in Honiara, to strengthen partnerships
with the government, and to facilitate coordination with other stakeholders. In 2016, the office will
be upgraded to an AsDB Extended Mission, which will further strengthen AsDB’s presence on the
ground.
The AsDB’s Pacific Liaison and Coordination Office in Sydney is responsible for country
programming and project implementation in Solomon Islands, supported by the Pacific Operations
Division in Manila.

STATISTICAL ISSUES
I. Assessment of Data Adequacy for Surveillance
General: Data provision has some shortcomings, but is broadly adequate for surveillance.
National Accounts: Recent technical assistance (TA) from the Pacific Financial Technical Assistance Center has led
to improvements in national accounts at constant and current prices. GDP estimates through 2014 on the
production side and the expenditure side were released in January 2016, and PFTAC will now provide TA to assist
with rebasing the constant price accounts to 2012.
Price statistics: A monthly consumer price index (CPI) is produced with a short lag (about a month), but only
covers the capital Honiara. The authorities are currently expanding the coverage in order to compile a nationwide
CPI, with assistance from the Australian Bureau of Statistics. The index weights are also to be revised using the
results of the 2012/13 Household Income and Expenditure Survey. A core inflation index was released in December
2013.
Government finance statistics: Monthly fiscal data for the central government are published by the Ministry of
Finance and Treasury (MOFT). The authorities have started collecting disbursement information on donors’ grants,
including those nonappropriated in the budget. Monthly public debt data are published, and the quality debt data
has improved through better coordination between the MOFT and the Central Bank of Solomon Islands (CBSI). The
MOFT does not report revenue, expenditure, balance and composition of financing for the general government
because it currently does not have the capacity to compile such statistics.
Monetary and financial statistics: The CBSI publishes monthly monetary and financial statistics (MFS) in summary
form and reports data for the central bank, other depository corporations and other financial corporations to the
IMF’s Statistics Department using the standardized report forms (SRFs). An integrated monetary database meeting
the monetary data needs of the CBSI, APD and STA is in operation. Financial soundness indicators are reported
quarterly.
External Sector Statistics: The CBSI has been compiling quarterly balance of payment statistics (BPS) using its
own survey since 2006. Compared to the previous method, which was based on foreign exchange transactions
reported through the banking system, the newly compiled BPS has improved both coverage and data accuracy.
However, these quarterly data have not yet been reported to the IMF's Statistics Department. Solomon Islands has
been one of the beneficiaries of the Japan Administered Account (JSA) Project on the improvement of external
sector statistics. A TA mission under this project was conducted in 2013, with more missions planned. The CBSI
does not report the international investment position (IIP) because it currently does not have the capacity to
compile such statistics.
II. Data Standards and Quality

Prepared jointly by the International Monetary Fund and
the World Bank Group

Debt sustainability analysis indicates that Solomon Islands faces moderate risk of external
debt distress, consistent with the last assessment in 2013. Under the baseline scenario, all
external and public debt indicators remain below the relevant sustainability thresholds.
However, the alternative scenarios suggest that this baseline is subject to significant risks,
particularly a shock to financing terms and one where growth is permanently lower. The
DSA has been extended to incorporate risks from natural disasters and climate change,
drawing on cost estimates from recent events in the region. Under an alternative scenario
of a single extreme weather event, debt remains sustainable. However, such events occur
on average every 10 years and multiple events could pose a risk to debt sustainability over
the 20-year DSA horizon. This risk can be mitigated by infrastructure investment and a
buildup of cash reserves.

RECENT DEBT DEVELOPMENTS

2012

1.
Fiscal buffers have been rebuilt in the Solomon Islands in recent years. Public debt fell sharply
to 17 percent of GDP at end-2012 from about 60 percent in 2005 under the Honiara Club Framework,
which prohibited new borrowing. Since 2012, the
Pacific Small States: Gross Public Debt
country’s’ debt position has registered one of the
(In percent of GDP)
60
strongest gains in the region (Figure on gross debt in
Decrease in debt ratio
in 2015 relative to 2012

Pacific Small States). This reflects a new debt
management strategy, adopted by the government in
40
May 2012, that allowed external borrowing to resume

and provided an anchor to ensure that debt remained

to about 10 percent of GDP by end-2015. This partly
reflected delays in a number of planned investment projects, including the undersea cable project and the
electricity network upgrade. In December 2015, the government also repaid the entire stock of domestic
debt, worth SI$99.5 million (US$12.2 million) using cash reserves, reducing total public debt to 10.4 percent
of GDP at the end of 2015. Looking forward, possible fiscal anchors for the Solomon Islands are targets for
cash reserves and the non-commodity primary budget balance, which is used in the DSA and discussed in
the staff report. Debt sustainability benefits come from improvements in public financial management
(PFM), which should continue to enhance revenue mobilization and the quality of spending.2

DSA ASSUMPTIONS
2.
The macroeconomic assumptions in the DSA reflect developments through end-2015. They
underpin the projection that starts in 2016 and runs for 20 years. These include a reduction in donor
support, a gradual decline in forestry output, and a prolonged closure of the Gold Ridge Mine, all of which
contribute to deterioration in the trade and current account balances in the medium term. The discount
rate used to calculate the net present value (NPV) of external debt remains at 5 percent. The key
assumptions are:


Growth. Long-term growth is maintained at between 3 and 3½ percent under cautious
assumptions and is somewhat lower than growth set out in the authorities’ development
plans. Positive growth spillovers are assumed to result from planned increases in
development investment, reflected in capital spending, which helps counteract the expected
long-term fall in forestry and minerals sector.

2
There is considerable scope to strengthen tax administration given that, for example, only 187 people account for 70 percent of
income tax revenues. This effort is being supported by the donors and the IFIs, particularly by the IMF’s Technical Assistance Center
in the Pacific, PFTAC, which has emphasized efforts to strengthen PFM.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

SOLOMON ISLANDS



Non-interest current account deficit. The deficit is expected to increase to close to 7.5
percent of GDP by 2017 from around 2 percent in 2015, reflecting a number of importintensive projects in the pipeline—the Tina River Hydropower Project (TRHP), the undersea
cable and Soltuna—as well as lower exports from the delay in reopening the Gold Ridge
Mine until 2020. Also contributing to an improvement in the balance after 2020 is an
assumed fall in fuel imports of 25 percent as TRHP comes on line that year.



External borrowing. External borrowing in 2015 helped finance the electricity network
upgrade, and should occur in 2016 and 2017, partly to finance the undersea fiber optic
cable. Concessional borrowing is projected to average about 2½ percent of GDP annually
over the next five years and 3.2 percent of GDP over the longer term. The effective interest
rate on external borrowing is around 1.5 percent in line with rates on concessional lending
from the multilateral development banks and donors.



Fiscal anchor and outlook. The non-commodity primary fiscal balance is used as the fiscal
anchor, which is set at a 2.5 percent deficit over the medium and long term. This results in
a rising primary fiscal surplus that peaks at 2.6 percent of GDP in 2025 and then declines,
turning into a small deficit by the end of that decade as commodity revenues decline with
grants, logging and mining revenues projected to fall a share of GDP. This contributes to
a buildup in cash reserves (reflected in the DSA residual) that is then run down. Grantfunded development expenditure is projected to decline and only be partially substituted for
by external borrowing. Revenues (excluding grants) are forecast to fall to about 30 percent
of GDP over the medium and long term with the decline in commodity-related revenues.3



Aid flows and FDI. Aid flows are expected to average about 13.5 percent of GDP over the
medium term—down from the 19 percent of GDP assumed in 2013. In the long term, aid
declines to about 10 percent of GDP even though the level continue to rise in nominal and
real terms. Historic and projected FDI numbers have been revised down substantially since
2013, largely due to improvements in data.4 Net FDI is now projected to be around
3½ percent of GDP over the medium to long term. The part of the current account deficit
not financed by aid and FDI flows is assumed to be financed by external borrowing.



Logging and mining. Logging output is expected to decline by about 4 percent per year on
average until 2025 and then to stabilize at this lower level. Gold Ridge Mine is expected to
remain closed until 2020, owing to persistently low gold prices and the high cost of
resuming operations after the flood damage. After reopening, production is assumed to
peak at 62,000 ounces per annum in 2023 and then to run down gradually. It is assumed to
run for 10 years with a cumulative output of 465,000, significantly lower than assumed in
2013 before the flood which, together with lower gold prices, probably reduced capacity.

3
This represents a substantial improvement from the decline in revenues to 27 percent of GDP assumed in the 2013 DSA and
reflects the benefit of PFM reforms that are underway.
4
Following recent TA, historic FDI data has been aligned with BPM 6 standards, to re-categorize net losses as negative reinvested
earnings; TA also identified weaknesses in survey methodologies that led to a significant overestimation of FDI flows.

Box 1. Solomon Islands: Incorporating Climate Change and Extreme Weather Shocks into
the DSA
The Pacific Island states are particularly exposed to climate change and vulnerable to extreme
weather events, which climatologists warn may be worsened by climate change. To provide
effective policy advice, these major long term costs and risks need to be quantified and
incorporated into an analytic framework—which the DSA provides—to assess how they will
impact countries’ fiscal position and external debt sustainability.
This assessment draws on research that estimates both the recurrent cost of climate change and
of the frequency and cost of natural disasters.1 The recurrent cost of mitigating the effects of
climate change is estimate at around 0.5 percent of GDP per year and is reflected in the DSA
baseline. This cost is assumed to be covered from government resources (i.e. not by additional
borrowing) and to be divided between the recurrent budget (0.2 percent of GDP) and
development budget that finances ongoing capital expenditures for climate change adaptation
(0.3 percent of GDP). The extreme natural disaster shock is incorporated in the DSA as a new
adverse scenario that results in losses and damage of around 15 percent of GDP and reflected in
a fall in real GDP growth of roughly 7.5 percentage points in the year of the disaster, a
deterioration of fiscal balance of about 7.5 percent of GDP in the year after the disaster, and about
15 percent of GDP of additional external public debt.
The DSA, by design, includes only one extreme weather natural disasters as a scenario over its
20 year horizon. However, more than one extreme weather event is possible over this period, in
which case extreme weather could have a significantly larger cumulative effect on debt
sustainability than the DSA results show (Figure 2). In preparation for such events, countries need
to have the capacity to mobilize large resources quickly at infrequent intervals, which they can do
by building up a substantial cash buffer over time that they can draw down. Also, infrastructure
investment to build resilience to reduce the cost of extreme weather events becomes more
important in light of this higher frequency. The Article IV Staff Report discusses the design of a
medium term fiscal framework and anchor to support these efforts and contain the risks to debt
sustainability from climate change and extreme weather.

Tina River Hydropower Project. This project involves a government guarantee of around
US$150 million (12 percent of GDP) to cover a power purchase agreement (PPA) between
the project developers and Solomon Islands Electricity Authority (SIEA). Since PPAs are not
typical financial instruments, the guarantee is not recorded on the government balance
sheet or in the DSA baseline. However, a customized scenario captures the full
materialization of this contingent liability in which SIEA is unable to make the PPA payment
and government steps in to pay the full PPA amount, estimated to be US$20 million per year
(a “worst-case” scenario). This is reflected in higher public expenditure, resulting in a larger
fiscal deficit over the 30-year contract period and higher public debt.

EXTERNAL AND PUBLIC DEBT SUSTAINABILITY
ANALYSIS
3.
External Debt Sustainability Analysis. Under the baseline scenario, all external Public and Publicly
Guaranteed (PPG) debt indicators remain below the policy relevant thresholds. Total external debt is
projected to gradually increase from 13 percent in 2015 to 36 percent of GDP over the long term while PPG
external debt is projected to rise to around 34 percent of GDP. This rise is driven largely by the financing of
infrastructure investment, of which an increasing share if financed by concessional debt rather than grants.
This represents an improvement from the last DSA, reflecting a lower-than-expected resumption in external
concessional borrowing since 2013.5 All indicators of sustainability (i.e. total and PPG debt as a ratio of GDP
or revenues or in present value (PV) terms, and external debt servicing) remain well below the indicative
thresholds. The PV of PPG debt in terms of export ratios remains below the indicative threshold of 100
percent, but rises from around 16 to 67 percent owing to the declining trend in commodity exports.
Sensitivity analysis highlights two risks to external debt sustainability, also identified in the 2013 DSA. These
correspond to a shock to financing terms – a rise in interest rates on new borrowing of 2 percentage points
– that leads to a breach in the threshold for ratios of PV of PPG external debt to GDP (of 30 percent), and a
negative export shock (Table 2).
4.
Public Debt Sustainability Analysis. Public debt remains below the threshold for debt
sustainability under the baseline scenario (Figure 2). However, sensitivity analysis also reveals that public
debt sustainability remains vulnerable to shocks, particularly to the extreme shock of permanently lower
growth and the fix-primary deficit scenarios (which “fixes” this deficit at its recent, expansionary, level
relative to the baseline, which has some consolidation). In both scenarios, the PV of debt to GDP ratio
breaches the 38 percent of GDP benchmark threshold by the end of the next decade. In the extreme shock
scenario, the PV of debt to revenue ratio rises to 169 percent of GDP by 2036. Scenario analysis suggests
that if the TRHP PPA contingent liability materializes, the impact on public debt would be manageable
(Figure 2), with relatively small effects on the PV of debt to GDP, revenue and debt service to revenue
indicators. This contributes to a rise in the PV of debt to GDP rises from 7 to 30 percent, about 7
percentage points above the baseline, but it stays below the 38 percent benchmark. Similarly, the natural
disaster shock discussed above results in a sharp, near term rise in the PV of debt to GDP that diminishes as
growth rebounds and remains below the benchmark (Figure 2).

The reflect the fact that part of the current account deficit has been financed through the aid in kind for capital projects from
donors, which are expected to be scaled back, and contributes to a shift from negative to positive residuals at the start of the
projection in Table 1 (i.e. these inflows are reflected in capital account but are not captured in net debt-creating flows in the Table,
which only correct for FDI inflows; and, thus, are reflected directly in the residual.)

CONCLUSIONS
5.
The current DSA suggests that the Solomon Islands continue to face a moderate risk of debt
distress, consistent with the 2013 DSA. 6 Although there is no breach of thresholds under the baseline,
external debt does rise above the debt to GDP and exports thresholds in the long run under some
scenarios. Overall, the analysis demonstrates the vulnerability of public debt sustainability to external
financing, fiscal and growth shocks; and, conversely, the contribution of donor funding and FDI to debt
sustainability. This highlights the need for to maintain a prudent fiscal policy. Borrowing that leads to a
buildup in debt should therefore remain cautious, targeting projects that broaden the export base and
strengthen potential growth (e.g. infrastructure investment) and increase resilience of debt sustainability to
shocks.
6.
The DSA has been extended to incorporate the effects of extreme weather events and
climate change in both the baseline and alternative scenarios. The baseline now includes the recurrent
fiscal costs of climate change, estimated at 0.5 percent of GDP per year, which includes infrastructure
investment to protect against adverse weather. The natural disaster shock scenario assumes losses of
15 percent of GDP; involving a sharp, temporary fall in GDP, and large, one-off reconstruction outlays. The
DSA finds that external and public debt remains sustainable under this scenario. However, in interpreting
this finding, it is important to recognize that the DSA includes only one instance of each shock over its
20 year horizon, and that multiple extreme weather events are possible over this period in light of their
10 year average frequency (Box 1). Policy, therefore, needs to prepare for the possibility of multiple extreme
weather events that could have a significantly larger cumulative effect on debt sustainability than the DSA
results show.

6
Solomon Islands is classified as having weak policies and institutions based on its three-year average CPIA score of
2.94. While this is a slight improvement on the 2013 average score of 2.89, which informed the previous DSA, it
remains below the 3.25 threshold required for classification as medium policy performer.

1/ Includes both public and private sector external debt.
2/ Derived as [r - g - ρ(1+g)]/(1+g+ρ+gρ) times previous period debt ratio, with r = nominal interest rate; g = real GDP growth rate, and ρ = growth rate of GDP deflator in U.S. dollar terms.
3/ Includes exceptional financing (i.e., changes in arrears and debt relief); changes in gross foreign assets; and valuation adjustments. For projections also includes contribution from price and exchange rate changes.
4/ Assumes that PV of private sector debt is equivalent to its face value.
5/ Current-year interest payments divided by previous period debt stock.
6/ Historical averages and standard deviations are generally derived over the past 10 years, subject to data availability.
7/ Defined as grants, concessional loans, and debt relief.
8/ Grant-equivalent financing includes grants provided directly to the government and through new borrowing (difference between the face value and the PV of new debt).

1/ Variables include real GDP growth, growth of GDP deflator (in U.S. dollar terms), non-interest current account in percent of GDP, and non-debt creating flows.
2/ Assumes that the interest rate on new borrowing is by 2 percentage points higher than in the baseline., while grace and maturity periods are the same as in the baseline.
3/ Exports values are assumed to remain permanently at the lower level, but the current account as a share of GDP is assumed to return to its baseline level after the shock (implicitly a
an offsetting adjustment in import levels).
4/ Includes official and private transfers and FDI.
5/ Depreciation is defined as percentage decline in dollar/local currency rate, such that it never exceeds 100 percent.
6/ Applies to all stress scenarios except for A2 (less favorable financing) in which the terms on all new financing are as specified in footnote 2.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

Statement by Ms. Vicki Plater, Alternate Executive Director for Solomon Islands
March 21, 2016

The ECF program has helped Solomon Islands achieve macroeconomic and
financial stability and supported the authorities’ efforts to strengthen core
institutions. The Solomon Islands authorities are determined to consolidate these
gains, maintaining the important buffers built and continuing the reform agenda.
This will ensure continuing improvements in the quality of resource allocation and
government spending, and ultimately help achieve stronger, sustainable, more diversified
and inclusive growth. This is vital to ensure improved economic opportunities and
outcomes for all Solomon Islanders, particularly the 80 percent of the population that live
in remote rural areas. To this end the authorities appreciated the constructive engagement
and tailored advice of Staff in the ECF Review and Article IV mission. The Article IV
Reports focus on building resilience to shocks (particularly natural disasters) and
financial inclusion is also timely as these are important priorities, integrally linked to
rural development. My authorities look forward to continuing close engagement with the
Fund into the future.
The achievements made under the ECF program have been significant, delivering
clear benefits to macroeconomic stability. Fiscal and external buffers have increased:
net international reserves rose to 9.8 months of imports in December 2015; external
public debt has dropped to 9.8 percent of GDP; and the government’s cash reserves for
December 2015 were 3.2 months of recurrent spending (SI$694m). Steady growth has
been achieved and inflation well contained. The government budget was near-balance in
2015 (-0.3 percent of GDP). Even in periods of stress the economy has proved resilient:
during the deadly floods that hit Honiara and Guadalcanal in 2014; the out-of-season
Cyclone Raquel in 2015; the ongoing El Niño event, and the sudden closure of the Gold
Ridge mining operation in early 2014.
These gains have been underpinned by notable progress in building institutions
under the ECF arrangement, a key objective of the program. In particular, the Public
Financial Management (PFM) Act and the Central Bank of Solomon Islands (CBSI) Act,
subsequent regulatory and implementation steps, and the comprehensive Debt
Management Framework (comprising the Debt Management Strategy, SOE borrowing
policy, On-lending policy, and Guarantee policy) have helped the authorities strengthen
macroeconomic stability and resilience. They provide an important anchor, and the
stronger institutional architecture also limits the potential for hard-fought gains to be
eroded in the future. Alongside the program, improvements in exchange rate
management and monetary operations, supported by useful and targeted TA, have also
enhanced macroeconomic management and stability.
Institutional strengthening is inevitably a long-term path in states that are small,
low-income, and/or in fragile situations; the Solomon Islands is all three. My
authorities are committed to continuing steadfastly along this path. As a small,
dispersed, and remote country vulnerable to external shocks and frequent natural

2
disasters, continuing to build resilience is vital. Furthermore, lifting growth is a key
challenge. Long-term economic growth averages around 3.5 percent, barely above the
rate of population increase. The drift of the population from rural to urban areas and the
growing number of unemployed youths also could undermine the recent improvements in
social cohesion and security. The authorities are determined to progress critical reform
efforts in order to sustain medium to long term macroeconomic stability and growth. This
includes giving priority to completing the legislative process to strengthen the financial
environment; continuing improvements to public financial management including
implementing the new Procurement Rules and Regulations; and Anti Corruption
measures, led by the Prime Minister. These are elaborated below.
Performance has been sound in achieving the program’s objectives. All quantitative
criteria under the program have been met by a considerable margin; this strong
performance continued in December 2015 (outside the monitoring of the program). The
only exception was the Indicative Targets on government-funded recurrent spending on
health and education, which were narrowly missed owing to stronger procurement
requirements by development partners in disbursing ODA in these sectors. Solid
progress is continuing to be made across the government’s reform agenda to further build
on the key institutional measures already established. Legislative bottlenecks - resulting
from continuing capacity constraints in the Attorney General’s Office, and exacerbated
by the limited number of parliamentary sittings that generally take place during a year
(given the challenges of a small very-dispersed country) – and the complexity of some
legislation have seen timeframes extended even while progress continues. The
combination of the 5th and 6th reviews, in conjunction with the short extension of the
program approved by the Board in December 2015, has been helpful to accommodate
progress on reforms and a platform for continued engagement with the Fund.
Economic outlook
Economic growth is solid although the authorities agree that risks are to the
downside. The economy is estimated to have grown by 3¼ percent in 2015. Growth is
expected to remain around 3 percent in 2016 driven by construction, communication and
manufacturing activity as the contribution from logging is expected to soften. The
Solomon Islands authorities are nonetheless cautious about the outlook as key trading
partners, in particular China, are slowing. While Solomon Islands has yet to see the
implications of slowing growth in Asia, it poses a risk to commodity prices and demand.
The full extent of the impact of the current El Niño event remains uncertain, in addition
to the ever-present risk from natural disasters.
Achieving sustained and inclusive growth is a key objective of the Solomon Islands
authorities, as set out in their Economic Development Document (the Medium Term
Development Plan 2016 to 2020, circulated separately to the Executive Board in line with
the IMF’s new policy on Poverty Reduction Strategy (PRS) documentation).
Agribusiness and fisheries offer considerable potential for future growth, as does tourism
and mining in the medium-term. Investment in infrastructure will be essential to support
rural development as well as private sector development, and to raise productivity across
a wider range of sectors. In addition, other complementary measures are needed to

3
improve the business environment including land reform, which is part of the
government’s agenda of “fundamental reforms”.
Fiscal performance and policies
Solomon Islands recorded a fiscal deficit of 0.3 percent of GDP in 2015, maintaining
solid cash buffers whilst also repaying all its domestic debt early. The budget outturn
was markedly better than the budgeted deficit of 5.5 percent of GDP, reflecting a slower
pace of spending early in the year and careful expenditure management, and better than
expected revenues. The outturn also incorporated the early repayment of SI$100m
(approx 1.1 percent of GDP) of domestic debt, further building buffers. This good
performance was retained even as the government was able to lift the implementation rate
of development spending relative to previous years (whereas in previous years the cash
balance has been bolstered by the inability of the government to implement its spending
plans).
The Solomon Islands authorities are committed to preserving fiscal discipline and
maintaining a strong cash reserve following the completion of the ECF
arrangement. Solomon Islands’ vulnerability to natural disasters underlines the
importance of maintaining meaningful buffers, as does the more challenging external
environment currently prevailing. While the 2016 Budget projects a similar deficit to that
projected in 2015, the Solomon Islands authorities are committed to carefully manage the
budget in order to preserve the gains made under the ECF. In particular, my authorities
appreciated the opportunity to discuss with Staff what tools could be useful to help them
manage their fiscal affairs following the expiry of the ECF. The authorities will target
the cash balance to not fall below two months of total expenditure. To give effect to this,
the authorities will put in place quarterly fiscal targets, and look to align expenditure
flows with revenue collection. Additional TA is being sought by the authorities from the
Fund to strengthen the management of consolidated funds, including cash balances. In
addition the authorities will review overall progress in spending as well as the spending
mix at the Mid-Year Update to ensure it is in line with the Solomon Islands’ development
priorities and fiscal objectives. The authorities will take a cautious approach to resuming
concessional borrowing and have set an Annual Borrowing Limit of SI$300 million for
2016, consistent with the debt sustainability threshold under their Debt Management
Framework (of a face value of debt to GDP of 25 percent).
Mobilising domestic revenue in an efficient way remains important for the authorities
to deliver their development objectives. The new Customs and Excise Bill – a long (400
pages) and complex piece of legislation including amendments to other revenue Acts will help to protect government revenue and promote accountability and transparency in
decision making. It has been approved by Cabinet for vetting by the Attorney General’s
Chambers, and is expected to be presented to Parliament later in the year.
Solomon Islands will continue to strengthen budget management and presentation,
and would value continued discussions on appropriate medium-term fiscal anchors.
My authorities see merit in enhancing the presentation of the budget and are open to ideas
on how this could be progressed. My authorities also look forward to continued

4
discussions with staff on their recommendation to use a non-commodity primary balance
target as a medium- to long-term fiscal anchor. It will be important to understand the
merits and implications of different options, noting that an anchor must be economically
meaningful as well as easily understood to be most useful from a political management
perspective.
The authorities are strongly committed to continue to strengthen public financial
management practices, with further measures in train. The new Procurement Rules
and Regulations are well-advanced and will come into effect by 1 July 2016, entrenching
discipline to procurement processes. This will help enhance the improvements being
made in the quality of resource allocation decisions as a result of the PFM Act. In
addition Cabinet has recently approved the development of a Capital Structure policy for
SOEs over the medium term with the objective of improving the performance,
governance and oversight of SOEs by promoting efficient investment decisions.
Considerable resource has been put into strengthening the systems for planning,
procurement and reporting of Constituency Development Funds. The Ministry of
Rural Development is significantly scaling up its staffing; each constituency office is now
well-resourced (including an accountant) and the Ministry is strengthening its central
capacity to analyze constituency development plans and ensure consistency in reporting.
A new project database system will further enhance this. A significant amount of
information is now being produced as every constituency has an annual development plan
and they report progress quarterly. The PFM Act has provided more governance to the
implementation of CDFs, which are now abiding by procurement processes and will be
covered by the new Procurement Rules and Regulations. My authorities welcome the
suggestions Staff have made as to how the information produced could be presented in an
accessible way – such as in the development budget by constituency – to further increase
awareness of what is being delivered through the CDFs (e.g. Staff’s analysis that the
amount of spending on capital projects under the CDFs is projected to increase in 2016).
The completed audit reports on CDFs are expected to be submitted to Parliament at the
sitting in the middle of the year, upon which they will be publicly available.
Control of tertiary education spending is being enhanced. The Solomon Islands
authorities are keen to ensure that the capacity of Solomon Islands at tertiary level
increases over time, but recognize it is important to consider what is the most effective
way to do this and also ensure that Solomon Islands has the vocational and trade skills
that it needs. A clear process is being used to determine the allocation of new
scholarships and to ensure the continued performance of scholars abroad. Nonetheless
there are continuing demand pressures as more students meet the academic achievement
threshold than scholarships available. Work is well underway on a new Education Bill
(expected before Parliament later this year) and reviewing tertiary education policies. The
results are expected to enhance clarity and responsibility for tertiary spending, separate
from primary and secondary education spending.
The Government is pursuing a strong anti-corruption agenda as an utmost priority.
An Anti-Corruption Bill is expected shortly that will give effect to the UN Convention
Against Corruption, prohibiting corruption in the public and private sectors and

5
establishing mechanisms for the investigation, prosecution and punishment of corruption
offences. It will establish the Solomon Islands Independent Commission Against
Corruption (SIICAC). Complementary legislation will also be introduced in the form of
a Whistle Blower Bill and a revised and enhanced Ombudsman Bill.
Staff’s analysis on resilience to natural disasters is very timely as this is a high
priority. The Solomon Islands authorities are placing an increased emphasis on disaster
risk preparedness and mitigation as immediate priorities, as set out in their EDD. They
are exploring different mechanisms to build buffers within a multi-pillar approach.
Domestically they are setting up a contingency fund for natural disasters, and looking to
strengthen the work of the National Transport Fund. They are also considering regional
mechanisms, including a proposed Melanesian Fund that would provide short-term
liquidity support. They will examine a future phase of the Pacific Catastrophic Risk
Insurance scheme, although earlier pilots failed to meet expectations and Solomon
Islands withdrew when it did not receive any payout following the 2014 floods.
Enhancing debt management capacity is also critically important when subject to
frequent natural disasters, and my authorities will look over time to better integrate this
into the DSA.
Monetary, exchange rate and financial policy
Monetary policy remains accommodative but the authorities are watchful for any
signs of inflationary pressures. In the first half of 2015 Solomon Islands experienced
deflation, which warranted supportive monetary policy and expansionary fiscal policy.
There was a return to low inflation in the second half of 2015. The authorities have
maintained current monetary policy settings but are alert to any building of inflationary
pressures. The authorities are conscious that monetary policy effectiveness is hampered
by excess liquidity and appreciate Staff’s views on tools that might help better manage
this. The authorities do not view the cash reserve requirement ratio as a viable tool at the
current conjuncture, and are receiving technical assistance from the Reserve Bank of
Australia on how to conduct liquidity swaps.
The basket exchange rate regime is operating well. Innovations to remove the
operational 1 percent band and to increase the buy-sell margin in foreign exchange
trading have enhanced exchange rate management. Bilateral exchange rates have shown
greater flexibility while the currency basket remains more stable. Bilateral exchange rates
are now published daily. The authorities are considering whether to include the renminbi
in the currency basket. My authorities are open to a periodic review of the appropriate
level of the peg but are conscious that without fundamentally addressing some of the
supply side constraints in the economy (such as the business climate and land reform),
the competitiveness benefits from devaluation may be shortlived. The authorities are
interested in continuing discussions on how to achieve a sustainable lift in
competitiveness.
The Central Bank of Solomon Islands (CBSI) is continuing work to implement the final
recommendations from the helpful Safeguards assessment.

6
Further upgrades to the legislative framework to ensure a stable and efficient
financial sector are well advanced. My authorities are committed to bringing these to
completion as a priority, as they are key planks in their efforts to strengthen financial
stability and inclusion. In particular:


The Credit Unions Act will help promote financial sector stability and
development. In February Cabinet endorsed the detailed policy paper and
instructed the Attorney General’s Chambers to draft the legislation. A model
Credit Union Bill has been prepared, which should substantially reduce the time
needed to finalize the Bill.



The revised National Provident Fund (NPF) Act will strengthen the NPF’s
governance structure and investment framework. Cabinet approval is being
sought for the Attorney General’s Chambers to proceed with drafting.



The Financial Institutions Act will modernize and strengthen supervision of the
financial sector. The CBSI has developed new financial instructions, issued new
Prudential Guidelines, and endorsed a Fitness and Propriety Regulation, in
anticipation of the new Act.

My authorities welcome Staff’s innovative and timely analysis on financial inclusion,
key to the government’s rural development objectives and to empowering women.
The CBSI has been proactive in promoting financial inclusion and the Governor chairs
the National Financial Inclusion Taskforce (NFIT) including government, financial
institutions, communication providers, and donors. NFIT recently endorsed the next
medium-term National Financial Inclusion Strategy (NFIS2), which sets out clear goals
and a coordinated approach to broaden and deepen financial inclusion in Solomon
Islands. Solomon Islands is a leader in mobile banking services among Pacific small
states, and one of the Taskforce’s four working groups is focused on digital finance. The
authorities are mindful that it is important to balance financial inclusion with financial
stability.
In conclusion, the ECF program has helped strengthen the institutional environment to
achieve and safeguard continued macroeconomic stability. Solomon Islands is
committed to continuing to advance their reform agenda, including completing remaining
legislative processes and continuing to strengthen public financial management. My
authorities view these as integral to their objective to build a robust and diversified
economy that delivers benefits for all, particularly those in the rural areas. Even when
capacity constraints and political management may slow the pace of progress, the
direction of effort and commitment is clear and the authorities are continuing to move
forward.

7
The IMF remains an important partner for Solomon Islands. My authorities would like to
thank Staff for their untiring commitment and support through the ECF. They look
forward to continued close engagement with the Fund following the expiry of the
program, including through technical assistance aligned with key priorities. The move to
a 12 month Article IV cycle is welcome and will help foster this.
