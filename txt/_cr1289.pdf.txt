STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2012 ARTICLE IV CONSULTATION
AND FIRST POST-PROGRAM MONITORING DISCUSSION

KEY ISSUES
Context: Iceland is gradually emerging from its severe post-crisis recession. Domestic
demand is driving growth and unemployment is declining, but inflation remains high.
Imbalances are unwinding, but all sectors of the economy remain highly leveraged. The
outlook is for a moderate recovery, but risks emanate from both external and domestic
sources.
Fiscal policy: Fiscal consolidation is continuing, but at a slower pace than previously
expected. Moderate expenditure overruns materialized in 2011, which will partly spill
over to 2012 and the medium term. Thus, a key priority is to put the medium-term
fiscal path back on track, which can be achieved with additional fiscal measures of
½ percent of GDP.
Monetary policy: With persistent inflation pressures and expectations consistently
above the CBI’s target, policy interest rates should rise. Monetary tightening will also
be needed to support capital account liberalization.
Capital controls: Lifting the capital controls remains an overarching policy challenge,
given the significant locked-in funds. This requires a gradual and cautious approach to
liberalization, calibrated to the strength of the balance of payments, reserve adequacy,
and the need to safeguard financial stability.
Private sector debt restructuring: Significant progress has been made in restructuring
household and corporate debt. But pressure for additional household debt relief, with
implications for public finances, remains very high. The high level of public debt
severely constrains room for such relief.
Financial sector policy: Additional efforts are needed to further strengthen
supervision and reduce banking system vulnerabilities.

CONTEXT
1.
Iceland’s crisis and recession were
severe, but imbalances have unwound
partially. The collapse of the entire financial
system in 2008 led to a deep recession, as
Iceland’s pre-crisis boom turned to a bust.
Investment and consumption fell to record low
levels as a share of GDP. Depreciation and the
sharp decline in domestic demand led to a
partial unwinding of macroeconomic
imbalances—the underlying current account
swung into surplus and inflation declined.

The banking system is now much
smaller. The number of commercial and
savings banks dropped to 14, from 23 prior the
crisis. Assets in the rebuilt system are
200 percent of GDP (900 percent of GDP
before the crisis). Two of the three core
commercial banks are under majority private
ownership.

Legacy vulnerabilities remain.
Households, corporations, and the
government are still highly leveraged. Nonperforming loans (NPLs) remain elevated

deposit concentration and financial
imbalances. The state-owned Housing Finance
Fund (HFF) is yet to be restructured and fully
recapitalized, and the remaining savings banks
need to be consolidated further. Supervision
has been improved, but identified weaknesses
still need to be fully addressed.

4.
The macroeconomic and financial
landscape has reflected these adjustments.
With imbalances partially unwound and
confidence picking up considerably, there are
clear signs of recovery: domestic demand is
expanding and financial markets are showing
signs of life. Nonetheless, high levels of debt
will take time to be fully worked out, with
macroeconomic consequences: the drag from
fiscal consolidation will diminish only
gradually, the krona has come under some
pressure through deleveraging of foreign
currency debt, and banks have yet to shift
gears away from loan workout to credit
intermediation.

ICELAND

RECENT ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS
A. The Economy is Expanding and Inflation has Picked Up
5.
The post-crisis recovery is taking
hold (Table 1, Figure1). Private consumption
(helped by allowances for early withdrawals of
pension savings and progress with household
debt restructuring) and investment drove
growth in 2011, and staff’s estimate is now
3.1 percent for the year. Fiscal adjustment
continues to be a drag (albeit diminishing) on
growth, but its effects on low-income groups
have been mitigated by the composition of the
measures taken, which in large part aimed at
safeguarding the social welfare system (Box 1).

7.
Inflation pressures have mounted
(Figure 2). Headline CPI inflation rose from
1.8 percent (yoy) in January 2011 to 6.3
percent (yoy) a year later, and inflation
expectations picked up markedly. Core
inflation also rose. The sharp pick-up reflects
the very strong pass through of exchange rate
developments in Iceland, as well as high
commodity prices, wage increases (agreed
among the social partners in May 2011,
leading to a rise in nominal wages of
6 percent), and alcohol and tobacco tax hikes.

6.
Labor market conditions have
improved, but long-term unemployment
remains a challenge. The unemployment rate
fell to about 7¼ percent in February (down
from around 8 percent a year ago), after
dipping to 6½ percent in the summer on
account of seasonal hiring. Nonetheless, longterm unemployment remains high—more than
one-third of unemployed individuals have
been unemployed for more than 6 months
(and one-quarter for more than one year).

8.
In response, the CBI began to
tighten monetary policy. The tightening was
partially a response to the rise in inflation
expectations and partially in recognition of the
need to gradually normalize monetary
conditions as the capital controls are lifted.
Policy interest rates were hiked by 25 bps in
August and again in November, bringing the
repo rate to 4.75 percent. But monetary policy
still remains accommodative as real policy
rates are negative.

B. The Trade Balance Remained Strong Amid Mild Krona Depreciation
9.
The trade surplus was still high in
2011, supported by exports. Export volumes
rose, as fish stocks were plentiful and
aluminum production continued at capacity.
Iceland had a banner tourism year in 2011,
with record arrivals and a tourism season
which lasted several months beyond the
normal span. Import growth also picked up,
reflecting strong domestic demand. The
underlying current account (which adjusts for
virtual transactions still recorded in the income
account), worsened but remained in surplus.

10.
But the krona depreciated modestly.
This reversed the steady appreciation trend of
2010. Depreciation pressures reflected
deleveraging by companies and local
governments: external debt was paid down
and refinanced in krona (which should
ultimately help to reduce currency
mismatches). To help stem the associated
volatility, the CBI in March intervened in the
foreign exchange market for the first time
since November 2009, selling euro 12 million.

Box 1. Safeguarding Iceland’s Social Welfare System
A key post crisis objective of the Icelandic authorities
was to preserve the social welfare system in the face
of the fiscal consolidation needed to put public
finances on a sustainable path.
With unemployment rising fast and real wages
plummeting, it was recognized early on that the
social impact of the crisis would be significant. Thus,
in designing the fiscal consolidation, the authorities
sought to protect vulnerable groups, notably by
introducing a more progressive income tax,
increasing only the upper VAT rate, and focusing
expenditure cuts on areas where efficiency gains
could be made—thereby creating space to preserve
social benefits.

And the percentage of households at risk for
poverty remained flat on account of social transfers.

At the same time, 67 percent of income tax revenue
in 2010 was collected from the upper 2 income
deciles, compared to 63½ percent prior to the crisis.
The tax share of individuals with below-median
income declined from 24 percent to 20 percent.
These policies, alongside crisis-related effects (such
as reduced income from capital gains), led to a
sharp reduction in inequality. Iceland’s gini
coefficient—which had risen during the boom—fell
in 2010 to levels consistent with its Nordic peers.

Standard CGER procedures suggest
that the krona is moderately undervalued
relative to medium term equilibrium. On
average, CGER procedures suggest
misalignment of around 10 percent—in line
with the assessment at the time of the
previous Article IV (Box 2). The unchanged
degree of misalignment is consistent with the
fact that, after about 40 percent real
depreciation over 2008–09, the real exchange

rate has been broadly stable. Similarly,
measures of market share and the trade
balance have been broadly flat. Other “rules of
thumb”, such as purchasing power parity
measures, indicate that Iceland’s price level is
in line with countries with similar income
levels.

Reserves increased sharply in 2011,
but declined after early debt repayments.
Gross international reserves stood at $8¾
billion at end-2011 (up from $5¾ billion at
end-2010). About one-third of the increase
reflected the old banks shifting their foreign
currency holdings to the CBI (Appendix II).
Gross reserves (excluding old bank deposits)
increased from about $4 billion to $6 billion,
on account of the drawing of the Nordic loans,
the Eurobond issuance in June, and Fund
purchases. As part of their asset-liability
management, Iceland in March made early
repurchases of most of its Fund obligations
falling due in 2013 (around 20 percent of the
total). Under the terms of Iceland’s bilateral
loan agreements, this required pari passu early
repayments to Iceland’s Nordic creditors, but
not to Poland or the Faroe Islands. Total
repayments to the Fund and the Nordics
amounted to around $1 billion.

However, CGER estimates do not
take into account the possible impact of the
lifting of capital controls. This would likely
increase pressures for depreciation in the near
term, given the length of time investors (both
domestic and foreign) have been captive. In
addition, some domestic entities with limited
foreign exchange incomes and scarce access
to foreign financing are in the process of
repaying external debt, which could exert
some pressure on krona over the next year.

Box 2. Iceland: External Competitiveness
Iceland’s competitiveness has improved
considerably since the crisis. In the aftermath of
the 2008 crisis, the nominal exchange rate
depreciated by almost 50 percent in effective terms.
The real effective exchange rate also saw a dramatic
improvement, although some of the impact was
mitigated by a short-lived surge in inflation. Since
then, the real effective exchange rate has remained
relatively stable around a new, depreciated, mean,
and is now only 3–4 percent above its 2010 average
level, despite the recent rise in inflation. The relative
stability of the real exchange rate is consistent with
the significant and sustained post-crisis
improvement in the trade balance, and (despite
some overshooting) the export market share.

Staff analysis suggests that the krona is
moderately undervalued relative to mediumterm fundamentals. The three standard CGER
methodologies suggest undervaluation in the range
of 5–20 percent. The macroeconomic balance (MB)
approach suggests the lowest degree of
undervaluation, reflecting medium-term
fundamentals that are consistent with a largely
balanced current account (compared with small
projected underlying medium-term surpluses). The
external sustainability (ES) approach suggests that
Iceland’s net foreign assets would be stabilized by a
current account deficit of around 1¾ percent of
GDP, pointing to a larger undervaluation of around
10 percent. The equilibrium exchange rate (ER)
approach suggests the largest degree of
misalignment, although this likely reflects Iceland’s
considerably more appreciated exchange rate in the
past (as captured by the country-specific constant). If
the constant were close to the average REER seen
since 2008, then the degree of undervaluation would
be close to 6 percent. The degree of undervaluation
implied by the equilibrium REER in the CBI’s QMM
model is also less than 10 percent (see CBI Working
Paper No. 44, 2009).

But other factors point to depreciation pressures
in the near term. In particular, the liberalization of
Iceland’s capital controls could introduce
considerable depreciation pressures. The flexible
nature of the strategy, which allows the authorities
to slow the liberalization if conditions are not
supportive, is an important safeguard against
excessive exchange rate volatility.

The stock market has become more
active. In 2011, turnover nearly tripled relative
to 2010 but remains far below pre-crisis levels,
and the equity index ended the year roughly
unchanged. Several Icelandic companies have
announced plans for listing on the stock
exchange in 2012. The corporate bond market
remains very thin.

to their March 2008 level)—a development
that should help repair households’ balance
sheets and support private consumption going
forward. Real house prices have stabilized at a
level much lower than their pre-crisis peak. But
careful attention will need to be paid to house
price growth, as the recent pick-up also may
reflect the impact of the capital controls.

Government bonds dominate
Iceland’s financial markets (Figure 3). Despite
support from the pool of funds locked in by
capital controls, long-term nominal bond rates
were volatile in 2011, reflecting inflation
developments: the yield curve steepened midyear but flattened once the CBI began hiking
rates, suggesting that monetary
transmission—albeit weak—has some traction.
CDS spreads fluctuated widely, largely on
account of the global turmoil, as did the
spread on the June 2011 Eurobond. In
November, S&P upgraded Iceland’s outlook to
stable from negative and, in February, Fitch
upgraded Iceland to investment grade.1

D. Banks Are Focused on Reducing Non-performing Loans
17.
Systemically important banks
reported strong profits, capital, and
liquidity (Figure 4).1 High profitability in 2011
(return on assets was about 3 percent) was
partly explained by asset recovery, as loans
that were purchased from the old banks at a
steep discount were restructured and revalued

upward. Since the three large commercial
banks are not paying dividends, all profits are
kept as retained earnings in the equity
account. This has pushed banks’ capital
adequacy ratio to 24 percent on average
(22 percent for core tier 1 capital). Liquidity is
also high (liquid assets account for one third of
total assets).

However, a Supreme Court ruling on
foreign-exchange indexed loans is likely to
adversely affect bank capital. In February,

Iceland is now rated investment grade by all three
ratings agencies.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

ICELAND

Iceland’s Supreme Court issued a new ruling
on the recalculation of illegal foreign exchange
indexed loans (according to an earlier ruling,
these loans must be recalculated retroactively
in krona). The new ruling appears to imply that
the interest rate charged retroactively on these
loans should be the contractual (i.e., foreign
currency) interest rate rather than the krona
interest rate, even though the loans will be
denominated in krona. Uncertainty on how to
interpret the ruling remains high, and banks
and the FME are still assessing the impact.
However, banks believe that the impact should
be manageable given their significant capital
buffers.
19.
NPLs have declined sharply, but
remain high. Banks reported NPLs of
23 percent at end-2011, down from
40 percent at end-2010. The substantial
decline is due to progress in restructuring
household and corporate debt.

Despite high liquidity, lending
remains sluggish (Table 2). Although some
measures of credit have shown increased
growth, it is not clear whether this is due to
new lending or to debt restructuring and asset
revaluation. There is some pick-up in new
lending, but it is likely modest.
21.
Bank funding is largely depositbased. For the three large banks, deposits
account for 70 percent of liabilities (excluding
equity), and the loan-to-deposit ratio is
declining. However, high deposit
concentration makes banks vulnerable to
sudden liquidity shocks. Banks also have a
considerable share of non-resident deposits,
which may exit once the capital controls are
lifted. In an important step toward funding
diversification, two of the large commercial
initiated covered bond programs.

OUTLOOK AND RISKS
A. The Outlook is for a Moderate Expansion
22.
Moderate growth is expected in the
near- and medium-terms (Table 3).




In 2012, domestic demand is projected to
drive growth: some investment projects
that had been planned for 2011 have been
shifted to 2012, and consumption is
expected to continue to recover. Offsetting
factors, notably weaker exports on account
of lower global growth (particularly
tourism, as marine products and aluminum
are highly supply-inelastic in the short
term) and rising imports, are projected to
keep annual GDP growth around
2½ percent.
Over the medium term, the sources of
growth are expected to shift from
domestic to external demand. Investment
is projected to be the driver of growth
through projects in the energy-intensive
sector and catch-up in other investment.
This should gradually raise the investmentto-GDP ratio. Steady private consumption
growth should support the economic
expansion and the fiscal drag should
diminish as budget consolidation is
completed. Net exports will initially make a
negative contribution to growth, given the
high import component of investment
projects, but the contribution should turn
positive when the investment phase ends
and the associated exports come on
stream. The output gap is expected to
close in 2013.

Inflation should gradually decline.
Inflation is expected to peak in the first quarter
of 2012 at around 6½–7 percent (yoy). It
should gradually decline thereafter, as the
effects of the increases in commodity prices
and wages fade and as the monetary
tightening assumed in staff’s baseline (and
consistent with recent statements by the
Monetary Policy Committee) takes hold.
Inflation is projected to reach the CBI’s target
of 2½ percent in early 2014.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

24.
The balance of payments may be
subject to considerable pressure in the
coming years (Table 4). For 2012, staff
projects an underlying current account surplus.
However, capital outflows are expected to be
large on account of Fund repurchases and
payments by the estates of the old banks. Over
the medium term, moderate underlying
current account surpluses should persist as the
global economy recovers. The capital account
is expected to be dominated by the lifting of
controls: under staff’s baseline, offshore krona
holdings are assumed to be largely released by
end-2013, while onshore krona holders are
assumed to gradually rebalance their
portfolios toward foreign assets in a way that
does not destabilize the balance of payments.
Payouts by the old banks are assumed to take
place in an orderly manner—supported by the
recent amendments to the capital account
legislation (see Policy Discussions, Section C).
Over this same period, external amortization is
expected to rise. International reserves are
projected to decline in US dollar terms, but
indicators of reserve adequacy should return
to more comfortable levels because capital
account liberalization will reduce short-term
external debt (as non-residents exit).
25.
Public and external debt ratios are
projected to decline rapidly over the
medium term, but still be high.


Gross general government debt (relative to
GDP) is projected to decline, starting in
2012 and continuing over the medium

term. By 2016, it is expected to reach
about 80 percent of GDP. Even with this
decline, cash buffers would still cover
about two years of gross financing needs.


Gross external debt is projected to fall
rapidly over the medium term, from
250 percent of GDP in 2011 to 150 percent
of GDP in 2016. This reflects the decline in
external liabilities associated with the
liberalization of the capital controls and
payments to non-residents by the old
banks. The old banks are still assumed to
enter into composition in 2012 (wherein
the estates of the old banks would become
holding companies, with creditors as the
shareholders), which would result in a
step-down in the external debt ratio as
debt is turned into equity (unless bond
payouts are preferred to cash, dividend or
equity payouts).

26.
The authorities broadly agreed with
this assessment of the outlook. However,
they saw the sources of growth shifted
somewhat more toward external, rather than
domestic, demand. This implies a higher trade
surplus in their forecast, and thus higher
reserves. In terms of potential output, the
authorities shared staff’s assessment that the
level of potential output would be
permanently lower (relative to pre-boom
trend), but that the growth rate could reach
2½–3 percent if investment picked up as
projected.

B. Risks Are Both External and Domestic
27.
Risks to the outlook are on the
downside (Box 3).


12

The most significant risk arises from the
possibility of a marked deterioration of
conditions in Europe, with implications for

Iceland through trade (mainly tourism),
market access (the government wants to
issue another Eurobond in 2012), foreign
direct investment, and commodity prices.
The banking system should remain

ICELAND

relatively sheltered from such a shock,
given its minimal reliance on wholesale
funding, limited exposure to European
sovereign debt, and capital controls (which
ban conversion of deposits from krona into
foreign currency). Nonetheless, any major
shock to the Icelandic economy could
adversely affect the banking system
through an increase in NPLs.


On the domestic side, Iceland faces a
number of risks. First, possible delays to
investment projects in the energy-intensive
sector would affect growth immediately
(through lower investment) and over the
medium term (through lower exports, as
new investment is needed to overcome
capacity constraints). Second, further wage

increases in excess of productivity gains
could fuel inflation and erode export
competitiveness. Third, deviations from
Iceland’s strong policy performance in
recent years—particularly on the fiscal
side—could undermine confidence in its
significant achievement to date. Finally, a
too-rapid pace of capital account
liberalization could affect growth through
krona depreciation (which would raise
inflation and private sector debt) and/or
confidence effects on consumption and
investment. Government policies have a
critical role to play both in reducing
uncertainty about the business climate and
in helping to ensure that future wage
agreements are not overly generous.

POLICY DISCUSSIONS
28.
Iceland’s policy implementation
since the crisis has been impressive, and it is
critical that momentum not be lost. With
significant fiscal adjustment already in train,
the size of the banking system reduced
dramatically, and the exchange rate stabilized,
Iceland’s achievements are substantial.
Nonetheless, the country still faces a number
of challenges—completing the fiscal

consolidation, lifting capital controls, devising
a post-capital controls monetary policy
framework, completing private sector debt
restructuring, and continuing with financial
sector reforms—that will require sustaining
momentum in policymaking, building stronger
policy frameworks, and strengthening
coordination. These challenges were the focus
of the policy discussions.

A. Completing the Fiscal Adjustment
29.
Fiscal consolidation is continuing,
but more slowly than previously expected
(Tables 5 and 6).


Preliminary data suggest that expenditure
overruns (mainly transfers at the central
government level) materialized in 2011,
increasing the general government primary
deficit to 1 percent of GDP (¾ percentage
point worse than expected at the time of
the last review under the SBA).



For 2012, the budget passed in December
implies a slightly weaker primary balance
than originally envisaged (by
¼ percentage point of GDP) on account of
higher spending (notably transfers).
Moreover, with some of the overspending
in 2011 likely to be permanent, the general
government primary surplus is now
expected to reach 1½ percent of GDP
(compared with 2 percent of GDP expected
earlier).

30.
The authorities and staff agreed that
implementation risks are rising. While the
deviations in 2011 and the 2012 budget are, in
isolation, not cause for great concern, there
are risks associated with implementing the
2012 budget. First, new—and politically

difficult—legislation still needs to be passed to
increase the fishing levy (a revenue measure).
Second, asset sales—now expected to
generate ¼ percentage point of GDP in
temporary revenue—may not materialize to
the extent expected. Third, the revenue take
from the recently introduced financial activities
tax has become more uncertain because its tax
base has shifted from employee compensation
(fairly predictable) to compensation and profits
(less so). And revenue may be reduced on
account of the recent Supreme Court ruling, if
bank profits are lower. Fourth, there is a risk of
further expenditure overruns. Finally,
weaknesses in Iceland’s budgetary framework
provide room for overspending by individual
government agencies.
31.
The authorities’ medium-term
objectives are within reach, but only with
additional measures.


Staff projections suggest that the
authorities’ objectives of a balanced overall
position in 2014 and a primary balance of
5 percent of GDP in 2016 would both be
missed by ½ percentage point of GDP
unless additional measures are taken.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

15

ICELAND



Staff therefore recommended that the
authorities take additional fiscal measures
of ½ percentage point of GDP to make up
for the slippage in 2012 and put the
medium-term fiscal path back on track.
The authorities underscored their
commitment to fiscal prudence and to
their medium-term objectives. However,
they also pointed out that implementing
the additional measures this year would be
difficult. Staff stressed that any further
deviations would risk undermining
Iceland’s significant fiscal achievements to
date.



Staff also urged the authorities to identify
contingency measures, particularly on the
expenditure side, in case implementation
risks materialize. The authorities
underscored their commitment to avoiding
further slippages, highlighting the recent
cabinet-level decision to strengthen fiscal
control (individual ministers may not bring
new spending proposals to cabinet
without an impact assessment from the
Ministry of Finance).

32.
The authorities and staff agreed that
it was important to address weaknesses in
Iceland’s fiscal framework. Legislation on
local governments was passed in October,
consistent with Fund TA proposals, and will
strengthen control over the finances of the
municipalities. Staff strongly endorsed the
authorities’ intention to submit to parliament

legislation for a new organic budget law, in
line with Fund TA recommendations. The new
law will address weaknesses in Iceland’s
budgetary framework, including the lack of
codified principles for fiscal policy making,
fragmentation of the budget process,
loopholes in budget execution that allow
overspending, and deficiencies in the coverage
of fiscal reporting. To underpin the new law,
staff recommended that the authorities adopt
a procedural fiscal rule, which would require
that the government set clear numerical
objectives. Staff analysis shows that, given the
structure of Iceland’s budget, no one fiscal
objective will allow for fully counter-cyclical
fiscal policy, strong predictability of
expenditures (important for planning
purposes), and high transparency (important
to ensure that the public can hold the
government and parliament accountable for
fiscal decision making). Thus, the choice of a
numerical fiscal objective will inevitably involve
tradeoffs between counter-cyclicality,
predictability, and transparency. Staff analysis
shows that a fiscal objective that limits
expenditure growth would be highly
transparent and strongly countercyclical.
However, such a fiscal objective was found to
be associated with a very volatile expenditure
path under shocks, which could pose
implementation difficulties relative to other
possible fiscal objectives (see Selected Issues
Paper on Fiscal Policy Objectives under a New
Fiscal Rule).

B. Normalizing Monetary Policy
33.
The authorities and staff agreed that
monetary policy should be gradually
tightened (Figures 5 and 6). With inflation and
inflation expectations consistently above the
central bank’s target, and with possible
pressures on the krona (pass-through to prices

16

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

is high) and strong wage growth, policy
interest rates should rise. Monetary tightening
will also be necessary as the capital account is
liberalized.
34.
The authorities are still considering
options for the post-capital controls

ICELAND

monetary framework. The choice of the
future monetary regime remains a matter of
intense public debate in Iceland. To help guide
the policy discussion, the CBI is preparing a
comprehensive review of the pros and cons of
different monetary regimes—from retaining
inflation targeting to euro adoption.
35.
The authorities and staff agreed that
the near-term focus should be on
strengthening Iceland’s existing policy
framework. This would include: (i) introducing
macroprudential tools (such as tighter loan-tovalue ratios and counter-cyclical capital
requirements) to help soften the link between
capital flows and domestic demand, thus
increasing the traction of monetary policy in

controlling inflation; and (ii) establishing a
clearer and more predictable framework for
fiscal policy making (which would help the CBI
better adjust monetary policy to the fiscal
stance). Indeed, staff analysis suggests that
macroprudential tools could help prevent the
most negative consequences of a credit bust.
At the same time, reducing pass-through and
achieving success with standard monetary
policy tools is still critical for controlling
inflation over the cycle. A more predictable
framework for fiscal policy making could also
contribute to an improvement in the inflationoutput trade-off (see Selected Issues Paper on
Strengthening the Monetary Policy Framework
in Iceland).

C. Lifting Capital Controls
36.
Lifting the capital controls remains a
key policy challenge for Iceland. Liquid
offshore krona holdings remain large, at
around 25 percent of GDP and 40 percent of
gross reserves. The challenge has deepened
with the global turmoil that began in August
2011, as new capital inflows did not materialize
to the extent hoped for.
37.
Capital account liberalization has
proceeded more slowly than expected. The
authorities’ strategy for lifting the controls is
state-contingent, not time-contingent, and
seeks to lift the controls using a series of
different methods.2 The first method of
liberalization consists of a “first leg” auction of
foreign currency in exchange for offshore
krona, followed by a “second leg” auction of
2

The authorities’ capital account liberalization strategy
is described in detail in the staff report for the 5th
review under the SBA (see
http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/cat/longres.aspx?sk
=24897.0).

krona for foreign currency (at the auction
exchange rate, which is more depreciated than
the onshore rate). After the failed second-leg
auction in August 2011, the CBI halted new
auctions and focused on preparing the socalled “FDI route” (which allows FDI inflows
through the auction process), in line with its
liberalization strategy. In February 2012, the
first auction under the FDI route was
completed. The CBI bought euro 140 million
from investors in exchange for krona
investments.
38.
The authorities and staff agreed that
the capital controls must be lifted
gradually. The authorities underscored their
commitment to the strategy set out in March
2011 and to a cautious approach, especially
given the difficult global environment. In this
regard, CBI officials noted the success of the
February auction and the announcement of
three more similar auctions in the coming
months. The authorities are also making more
active use of balance of payments

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

17

ICELAND

projections—both internally and in wider
fora—which staff strongly welcomed. The
authorities and staff agreed that this could
facilitate the public’s understanding of the
consequences of a too-rapid liberalization,
given Iceland’s reserve position. It was agreed
that the speed of capital account liberalization
will need to be calibrated by the strength of
the balance of payments outlook, reserve
adequacy, and the need to safeguard financial
stability. Given the uncertainty in the global
environment and its potential adverse impact
on the conditions for liberalization, staff was of
the view that additional time may well be
needed to lift the capital controls (beyond
their expiry in legislation at end-2013).
39.
New legislation will help address
risks associated with capital account
liberalization, but may give rise to new
concerns. The new legislation tightens the
capital controls by removing the exemption
from the controls granted to the estates of the
old banks, including for them to pay out the
proceeds from asset recovery (which are
mainly in foreign currency, but also partly in
krona) to foreign creditors. The CBI will now
have responsibility for granting exemptions for
the old banks. This will help avoid that payouts

by the old banks are inconsistent with the
strength of Iceland’s balance of payments. At
the same time, however, as the new legislation
marks a significant tightening of the controls,
it could increase uncertainty about the future
course of liberalization and reduce investor
confidence in Iceland, with possible
implications for FDI, market access, and
financing costs. Staff therefore urged the CBI
to publish as soon as possible rules that will
clarify the criteria that will guide decisions on
exemptions.
40.
Enforcing the capital controls
remains essential. To this end, Iceland has
introduced new exchange restrictions that
require approval by the Fund. The restrictions
address principal payments and payments on
the indexation of principal from holdings of
amortizing bonds, which are currently not
captured by the controls and which can lead to
large balance of payments outflows. Iceland’s
capital controls regime also continues to
marginally affect the conversion and transfer
of some interest on bonds, which also gives
rise to an exchange restriction. It is envisaged
that these restrictions will be removed as part
of the liberalization process.

D. Concluding Private Sector Debt Restructuring
41.
Private sector debt restructuring
continues to advance (Figure 7). Improved
data collection and dissemination by the banks
has begun to shed light on the amount of debt
relief that has been delivered. The measures
agreed in December 2010 for both households
and SMEs have been implemented at a steady
pace. Preliminary data suggest that writeoffs
have amounted to nearly ISK 200 billion
(12 percent of GDP) for households—most of
which is due to recalculation of foreign
exchange-indexed debt—and ISK 900 billion

18

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

(50 percent of GDP) for corporates—about
three-quarters of which is for large
corporations and the rest for SMEs. Banks
report that over 80 percent of household and
corporate applications have been processed.
Staff welcomed this progress, noting that
bringing the process to completion is critical
for a full recovery of the Icelandic economy.
42.
At the same time, progress with
more complex debt restructuring cases
remains slow. Comprehensive household debt

ICELAND

restructuring for those with more severe debt
service problems continues to take much
longer than expected. This reflects the
complexity of some cases. Moreover, the CPIindexation of mortgages means that
households will continue to face rising loanto-value ratios unless real house prices
continue to rise.
43.
Pressure for additional household
debt relief remains high, particularly in
light of the latest Supreme Court ruling. The

ruling—which will likely lead to additional
writedowns for holders of foreign-exchange
indexed debt—has fueled political pressure for
new debt relief for holders of CPI-indexed
mortgages (who have not benefitted from
court-mandated writedowns). The authorities
and staff agreed that fiscal space for additional
debt relief was severely constrained. Moreover,
staff underscored that across-the-board debt
relief would be untargeted and may not
provide sufficient relief to households in the
most distress.

E. Completing the Restructuring and Strengthening of the Financial Sector
44.
The banking system is being
gradually strengthened (Tables 7 and 8).
Banks’ buffers against potential unexpected
losses have increased through the retention of
profits. NPLs are declining, deposits are
increasing, and liquidity is high. Loan portfolios
are subject to semi-annual reviews by external
auditors, banks are working toward adopting
Basel III liquidity ratios, and a recent FME
assessment has confirmed that banks have
made substantial reforms to their risk
management systems.
45.
Nonetheless, the authorities and
staff agreed that some key legacy
vulnerabilities are yet to be fully addressed.
The latest Supreme Court ruling has created
new uncertainty about banks’ asset values, and
additional rulings with negative implications
for bank capital cannot be excluded. On legacy
vulnerabilities, NPLs are still above healthy
levels, imbalances will take some time to
unwind, and deposit and loan concentration
remains a concern.3 Looking ahead, it will take

3

In Iceland, the definition of NPLs is stricter than in
most countries. In particular, if one single loan is
overdue for more than 90 days the entire credit

time before a clear picture emerges about the
ability of borrowers to fully service their
restructured loans.
46.
It was agreed that efforts need to
continue to ensure that the restructuring of
the banking system is completed. This is
essential to help ensure that financial stability
is maintained while the capital controls are
lifted.


Since fully addressing the remaining risks
and vulnerabilities in the banking system
will take some time, banks should continue
to maintain high capital buffers. To this
end, it will be essential to maintain the ban
on dividend payments (and apply it equally
to all commercial banks) until
vulnerabilities have been sufficiently
reduced. The authorities concurred on the
need to avoid premature dividend
payments.



Greater transparency on the part of the
banks would help boost confidence ahead
of the full lifting of capital controls. First,

position of the borrower is considered nonperforming.

(continued)
INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

19

ICELAND

enhanced disclosure of buffers available
would provide greater clarity about banks’
ability to absorb unexpected losses.
Second, since income recognition
policies—notably relating to restructured
and non-performing loans—can have a
material impact on banks’ profits, greater
transparency about these policies and their
contribution to reported profits would
provide comfort that banks’ reported
financial positions are based on prudent
assumptions and policies.


Improvements in the FME’s annual ICAAP
exercise can bolster its credibility. Staff
urged the authorities to base the 2012
ICAAP exercise on stress scenarios with
common assumptions and a focus on tail
risks (especially regarding asset quality),
supported by an independent asset
valuation. Looking farther ahead, staff
recommended that the FME design and
announce, in coordination with the banks,
a strategy to report ICAAP results. The
authorities agreed on the need to
harmonize the underlying stress scenarios,
and to work towards full disclosure of the
ICAAP exercise.



The FME and staff agreed that it would be
useful for the banks to prepare periodic
updates of contingency plans to deal with
unexpected liquidity problems. Staff also
urged the authorities to continue to ensure
that banks are following prudent policies
on income recognition, especially on
restructured and past due loans.



The authorities and staff also agreed that,
while solvent and broadly liquid, a small
group of non-systemic institutions will

20

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

likely require further consolidation, given
increased competition from the large
commercial banks.
47.
The restructuring of HFF is yet to be
completed. Additional capital injections
(estimated at around 1 percent of GDP) are
likely to be needed to bring HFF’s capital up to
its traditional level of 5 percent of riskweighted assets—the authorities intend to
make the necessary injection once HFF has
completed the restructuring of its loan
portfolio. HFF’s broader restructuring
(including, for example, its government
guarantee) will be addressed in the context of
a comprehensive report on the state of
Iceland’s financial system.
48.
A strong, intrusive, and independent
supervisory agency is essential to help
avoid the build-up of risks that can lead to
crisis. In this context, the CBI and FME have
put in place a framework to ensure effective
coordination. Since last year, as part of its
strategy to address identified supervisory gaps,
the FME has been implementing a second
wave of reforms to its organization and
business model. Going forward, additional
examiners with credit risk expertise may be
needed in the onsite inspection area and the
credit risk bureau may need more resources to
become a powerful supervisory tool. Staff
underscored that preserving the FME’s
independence, and its capacity and willingness
to act, is essential to ensure that the needed
strengthening of supervision continues, toward
full compliance with Basel Core Principles.

ICELAND

POST PROGRAM MONITORING
49.
Iceland’s achievements under its
Fund-supported program were substantial,
and some key lessons can be drawn.4 First,
strong ownership of the program—notably on
the fiscal side—was critical for its success.
Second, the social impact of crisis can be
contained by ensuring that vulnerable groups
are protected and that the burden of
adjustment falls on those most capable of
bearing it. Third, an approach to bank
restructuring in which creditors bear part of
the initial cost, while retaining upside gains,
can help limit the public sector burden. Fourth,
in certain circumstances, capital controls can
be a useful tool to prevent disorderly balance
of payments adjustment.
50.
Iceland is in a good position to
repay the Fund. The baseline balance of
payments is similar to that anticipated during
the last program review. Excluding deposits of
the old banks, the path for reserves is broadly
in line with past projections. Iceland’s external
debt is expected to remain on a downward
path over the medium term. Given this
outlook, Iceland’s obligations to the Fund
remain manageable (Table 9). Reserve
adequacy in 2012 and 2013 will be somewhat
weaker after the early repayments to the Fund
and Iceland’s Nordic creditors (compared with
no early repayments), although the ratio of
gross reserves to short term debt is projected
to remain above 100 percent.
51.
Nonetheless, Iceland continues to
face a number of risks to its balance of
payments and public finances (Box 3).

4

See Iceland Ex Post Evaluation of Exceptional Access
under the 2008 Stand-By Arrangement.



Risks associated with the liberalization of
capital controls remain sizeable (Figure 8).
As noted in previous staff reports, an
excessively fast pace of liberalization could
result in large outflows, possibly triggering
a disorderly depreciation of the krona or a
significant loss of reserves. Residents’
pent-up demand for foreign assets could
be far greater than the levels currently
assumed in the baseline. Transactions
relating to the old and new banks
(including asset recovery payouts, dividend
payments, and final settlement of the old
banks’ estates), if not managed cautiously,
could also result in larger near-term
outflows than assumed in staff’s baseline.
Any unintended weakening of
administrative controls during the
liberalization could prompt circumvention,
effectively speeding up the pace of
liberalization and depleting reserves.



Litigation risks remain a concern for
Iceland, although they have diminished
considerably. First, on Icesave, in
December the EFTA Surveillance Authority
(ESA) referred the matter to the EFTA
Court. Should the EFTA Court find Iceland
in breach of the EU Directive on Deposit
Insurance, it is unclear what the actual
sovereign liability would be and on what
terms—interest and maturity—Iceland
would have to discharge it. These risks are
mitigated by the significant asset recovery
from Landsbanki’s estate, which is
estimated to cover more than 100 percent
of Icesave deposits. Stress tests suggest
that, while fiscal costs would rise
substantially in some possible outcomes,
public debt would remain on a downward
path (Appendix I). Second, Iceland’s
INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

21

ICELAND

Supreme Court ruled in October 2011 that
the Emergency Law was constitutional,
substantially reducing the legal risk
stemming from the handling of claims on
the failed banks.

reduces risks associated with potential
policy missequencing. The new legislation
also mitigates risks of disorderly balance of
payments flows.


Building buffers through continued nonborrowed reserve accumulation will be
important. The authorities also indicated
that they are considering issuing another
Eurobond, if conditions permit, which is
welcome.



In the event of a significant deterioration in
external conditions, staff and the
authorities agreed that the flexibility in the
capital account liberalization strategy
could be used to slow the pace of
liberalization.

52.

Implementation of the macroeconomic
and financial policies identified at the end
of the SBA will be important for
maintaining confidence going forward.
The authorities’ commitment to a gradual
and stepwise process for lifting controls,
and to ensuring that the controls remain
effective during the liberalization process,

STAFF APPRAISAL
53.
Iceland has achieved much since the
crisis, and policy implementation has been
impressive. The economy is growing again,
public finances are on a sustainable path, and
the restructuring of the financial sector is well
underway. Nonetheless, considerable
challenges remain. Tackling these will require
steady policy implementation, increased
coordination, and stronger policy frameworks.
54.
The economic recovery is taking
hold. Growth turned positive in 2011, and the
outlook is for a moderate expansion over the
medium term. The labor market is expected to
continue to improve, reducing high
unemployment. Inflation should gradually
come back to target, reflecting tighter
monetary policy.
55.
Risks to the outlook emanate from
both external and domestic sources. The
most significant risk arises from the possibility
of a marked deterioration of conditions in

22

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

Europe, with implications for Iceland through
trade, commodity price, and financing
channels. On the domestic side, further delays
in investment and uncertainty about the legal
and business environment could weigh on
growth. Deviations from Iceland’s recent
strong policy performance, particularly on the
fiscal front, could undermine confidence.
56.
It is essential that fiscal adjustment
be completed. The expenditure slippages in
2011 are unfortunate and, alongside the
weaker-than-envisaged 2012 budget, have
slowed the pace of consolidation. Rising
implementation risks for 2012 are also of
concern. Nonetheless, additional permanent
measures of ½ percent of GDP would bring
the authorities’ medium-term fiscal objectives
within reach. Contingency measures should
also be identified in case implementation risks
materialize in 2012. This will help ensure that
public finances remain on a sustainable path
and that the impressive gains to date are not

ICELAND

eroded. The authorities’ strong stated
commitment to their medium-term fiscal plan,
alongside recent steps to improve fiscal
control, is welcome.
57.
Improvements to the fiscal
framework are welcome. Passage in
September of the Local Government Act is an
important step toward strengthening local
government finances. The authorities’
intention to submit to parliament new
legislation on an organic budget law, drawing
on Fund technical assistance, is most welcome.
58.
Monetary policy should be gradually
tightened. With inflation and inflation
expectations above the central bank’s inflation
target, policy interest rates should rise. A
tighter monetary stance will also be needed to
support the capital account liberalization. On
the framework for monetary policymaking,
Iceland should focus in the near term on
strengthening its existing framework, including
through the use of macroprudential tools
which can help limit the adverse effects of a
turn in the credit cycle.
59.
Lifting capital controls is an
overarching challenge. With a large amount
of locked in non-resident funds and significant
pent-up demand by residents for foreign
assets, capital account liberalization is one of
Iceland’s key policy challenges. A gradual
approach remains essential. The speed of
liberalization will have to be adapted to the
strength of the balance of payments outlook,
reserve adequacy, and the need to safeguard
financial stability. In view of the uncertain
global environment, the conditions for lifting
the controls may well take additional time
(beyond end-2013) to be fully met. To this end,
the removal of the exemption on payouts by
the estates of the old banks helps mitigate

risks of too-rapid liberalization. At the same
time, it is essential that policies with respect to
the liberalization process are as predictable as
possible to help guide investor and public
expectations. The CBI should therefore clarify
as quickly as possible the way that payouts
from the estates of the old banks will be
handled, including through new published
rules on exemptions.
60.
The progress on private sector debt
restructuring is welcome, but the prospect
of new delays is a concern. Debt
restructuring must be brought to completion
as soon as possible. To underpin a sustainable
recovery, it is essential that households and
corporations have greater certainty about their
financial positions. The February 2012
Supreme Court ruling has increased
uncertainty about how foreign exchangeindexed loans are to be recalculated and may
slow the restructuring process. It is essential
that further delays be avoided.
61.
New calls for across the board writedowns of household debt should be
resisted. Such measures would be untargeted
and would not fully address the problems of
those most in need. Moreover, the high level
of public debt severely constrains the room for
new measures that are not paid for through a
reprioritization of expenditures or new revenue
measures. In this regard, it is critical to ensure
that Iceland’s public finances remain on a
sustainable path and that its significant fiscal
achievements are not undermined.
62.
Progress continues to be made on
bank restructuring, but additional efforts
are needed to reduce vulnerabilities. NPLs
have been reduced significantly; deposits are
increasing gradually; and liquidity is high. The
semi-annual portfolio reviews by external

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

23

ICELAND

63.
auditors should help to build
confidence and ensure proper asset valuation.
Nonetheless, new risks and legacy
vulnerabilities pose challenges. The latest
Supreme Court ruling is likely to lead to further
writedowns of foreign exchange-indexed
loans, adversely affecting banks’ loan
portfolios and capital positions, but banks
expect the effect to be manageable. On legacy
vulnerabilities, more needs to be done to
further reduce NPLs, lower bank imbalances,
and decrease deposit and loan concentration.
Dividend payments should therefore be
prevented until vulnerabilities have been
sufficiently reduced. The FME should continue
to closely monitor recently restructured loans
and banks’ income recognition policies. In
other areas, HFF still needs to be fully
recapitalized and non-systemic institutions
need to be restructured and consolidated.
64.
Financial sector supervision must be
further strengthened. A strong, intrusive, and
independent supervisory agency is essential to

24

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

guard against the build-up of risks that can
lead to crisis. To this end, the framework for
effective coordination that CBI and FME have
put in place is welcome. It is critical that
progress continue to be made in addressing
identified supervisory gaps: the reforms to the
FME’s organization and business model are an
important step in this regard. Preserving the
FME’s independence in both reality and
perception, as well as its capacity and
willingness to act, is essential to ensure that
the needed strengthening of supervision
continues.
65.
Staff proposes to hold the next
Article IV consultation on the regular
12-month cycle. Staff supports the
authorities’ request for Board approval of
measures that give rise to exchange
restrictions subject to Fund jurisdiction. The
measures have been imposed for balance of
payments purposes, are non-discriminatory
and temporary.

1/ The assumptions underpinning each shock scenarios are:
Equity withdrawal: Post-composition old bank creditors withdraw some equity capital from new banks in 2013.
Resident flight: During 2012-2016 ,residents take an additional 1 percent of broad money overseas.
Partial access: During 2012-2016, 25 percent of projected baseline new external borrowing is not possible.

APPENDIX I. DEBT SUSTAINABILITY ANALYSIS
1.
External and public debt are on
sustainable paths, but risks remain elevated
(Tables A1–A2; Figures A1–A2).

A. External Debt Sustainability Analysis (DSA)
2.
The baseline external debt path
takes into account the following
assumptions:






42

Available data on the three old banks'
asset recovery up to September 2011
suggest that recovery has continued to be
somewhat faster than previously
anticipated. These recoveries are reflected
in external debt because these assets are
recorded as liabilities to nonresidents until
they can be paid out to creditors. The
estate of old Landsbanki made their first
interim payment to creditors in December
2011. Otherwise, the time at which each of
the old banks are assumed to make their
first payments of recovered assets to
external creditors is in line with that in the
last review, with initial payments expected
in 2012, although the pace of payments is
more modest than previously assumed.
The treatment of potential liabilities
related to Icesave deposits remains as it
did in the 6th review staff report, with the
dispute to be settled through legal
channels. As before, the United Kingdom
and the Netherlands are treated as priority
claimants on the Landsbanki estate. This
treatment recognizes external debt in the
same way as that arising from asset
recovery from the other old banks—the
debt accrues over time as assets are
recovered (see ¶3)
As before, two of the old banks indicated
the possibility that their creditors may

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

choose resolution through composition
(through which the estates of the old
banks become companies owned by their
creditors) rather that liquidation. Given
this, these two old banks are assumed to
become companies controlled by their
shareholders in 2012. As a result, the asset
recovery that has been treated as external
debt of the old bank is transformed into an
equity liability instead. This reduces
external debt at end-2012.


Interest rates for new borrowing
throughout the projection period are
assumed to be somewhat lower than in the
last DSA, reflecting reduced global funding
costs.



External borrowing by the central
government (aside from that from bilateral
creditors) and its enterprises are assumed
to be rolled over. As before, the central
government is assumed to issue additional
bonds to cover (on average 30 percent) of
the CBI’s external debt that falls due over
2012–16. Local municipalities are assumed
to only partially roll over their debt, with
an average rollover rate of around
40 percent assumed over the next two
years. Corporations under financial stress
are assumed to be unable to roll over
external debt.



As before, external debt declines with the
implementation of the authorities’ capital
account liberalization strategy during 2012
and 2013, as captive non-resident krona

ICELAND

(around 25 percent of GDP) holdings are
assumed to exit and be only partially offset
by new inflows. The DSA also assumes
that, as part of the strategy to liberalize the
capital controls, the government issues
$0.4 billion worth of Eurobonds in
exchange for krona-denominated
government securities held by nonresidents.
3.
The external debt path is expected
to decline substantially over the medium
term. External debt is estimated at
250 percent of GDP in 2011, and is expected to
fall to around 140 percent of GDP by 2017.
Around one-third of the 2011 debt stock
reflects external liabilities to nonresidents
caught by the capital controls and expected
payments to foreign creditors associated with
asset recovery of the old banks, although this
declines as liabilities are paid and the old
banks go through composition.
4.
The external debt path is contingent
on the eventual outcome of the Icesave
dispute. Litigation surrounding the Icesave
claim poses risks to the baseline. Scenarios
considered in this DSA are: (i) Iceland is found
by the relevant court to be liable for all
(insured and uninsured) Icesave deposits; and
(ii) Iceland is found by the relevant court to be
liable for insured Icesave deposits. Under both
of these scenarios the potential liability is
treated as a loan under which the government
reimburses the residual amount of covered

Icesave deposits after asset distributions plus
financing costs. Interest is accrued until after
remaining litigation is resolved (assumed to be
in 2014), with the accumulated amount
becoming an additional obligation of the
Iceland. In addition, for comparison, the
implications of the December 2010 Icesave
agreement for external debt are also shown. In
previous DSA a separate scenario, where
insured deposit have super-priority status (i.e.,
insured deposits would be paid out before
uninsured deposits) in the estate of
Landsbanki, was included, but a recent
Supreme Court decision has made such a
scenario redundant. Each of these scenarios is
treated the same way as in the Public DSA, and
would involve an upward revision of the debt
path, with coverage of both the insured and
uninsured deposits having the largest impact.
5.
Stress tests suggest that the
downward trajectory remains a robust
result. Standard shocks would not disturb the
downward trajectory of the external debt ratio.
Realization of any of the litigation risk
scenarios would result in higher debt
throughout the medium term, although the
debt path remains on a downward trajectory
as assets are recovered, claims are settled, and
old banks go into composition. The historical
scenario or an exchange rate depreciation of
30 percent would have the strongest effect,
but even under this scenario the debt ratio
would resume falling after the initial increase.

B. Public Debt Sustainability Analysis
6.
Iceland’s public debt sustainability
analysis (DSA) is based on the following
underlying assumptions:


The 2011 primary balance was weaker
by ¾ percent of GDP than previously

expected. However, with a slight
improvement of the net interest
payments relative to the previous DSA,
the overall deficit is estimated at
4½ percent of GDP (½ worse than
previously expected).

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

43

ICELAND



The 2012 budget adopted by the
authorities and current macro
assumptions imply that the 2012
primary balance will be slightly eased
(by ½ percent of GDP) relative to the
target established at the 6th review
under the SBA, and the overall deficit is
expected at 2¾ percent of GDP.



Over the medium term, the primary
balance is expected to reach
4½ percent of GDP in 2016, unless
further measures are implemented to
restore the path agreed at the time of
the 6th review and bring the primary
balance to 5 percent of GDP. This
implies that the overall deficit will not
close until 2015 and the overall
balance will reach ¾ percent of GDP in
2016 rather than 1½ percent of GDP as
previously projected.



HFF recapitalization and savings-bank
related expenditures amounting to
2 percent of GDP have been
postponed until 2012.

7.
General government debt is
estimated at 99 percent of GDP in 2011.
(Table A2, Figure A2). Due to the slight fiscal
relaxation in 2012, the debt path is expected to
be somewhat flatter than under the previous
DSA. Nonetheless, provided no further
slippage occurs in the 2012 budget
implementation, the primary balance will still
exceed the debt stabilizing balance; however,
the margin has narrowed relative to previous
projections. Low interest rate profile will
support favorable debt dynamics in 2012–13,
but the real interest rate/GDP growth
differential is expected to reverse on average
to around 1 percentage point in the medium
term.

44

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

8.
The baseline debt trajectory is very
sensitive to growth shocks (Figure A2). A
standard growth shock would reverse the
downward path of public debt and keep it well
above 105 percent in the absence of offsetting
measures. An interest rate shock, a combined
macro shock, and an interruption of the fiscal
consolidation would flatten the debt path. A
30-percent depreciation of the exchange rate
would raise the debt ratio to 107 percent of
GDP in 2013 and leave debt at 97 percent of
GDP in 2017.
9.
The outcome of the Icesave dispute
continues to weigh on the potential debt
path. A recent Supreme Court ruling
acknowledged the priority of wholesale
deposits. This makes a scenario with an
assumption of super-priority of retail deposits
redundant. The asset recovery assumption has
increased above 100 percent. Other
assumptions regarding the estimates remain
as in the previous assessment, and the results
are broadly similar. The contingent liability of
the government at end-2011 is estimated at 6
percent of GDP if only insured deposits are
covered, and 12½ percent of GDP if insured
plus uninsured deposits are covered (Panel A).
Applying penalty rates would increase the
estimated contingent liability at end 2011 to
9¼ percent of GDP for insured deposits and
19¼ percent of GDP for all deposits. Should
the most recent agreement take effect (Panel
B), the NPV of the cost to the government
would amount to 3 percent of GDP at end2011, assuming payments commence in 2013.
This cost could increase to 8 ½ percent of GDP
if penalty interest rates are applied.

10.
Finally, contingent liability shocks
unrelated to the outcome of the Icesave
dispute could have substantial effects. A
30 percent contingent liability shock could
raise public debt above 120 percent of GDP in
2013. In the medium term, public debt is

expected to decline to about 115 percent of
GDP.

1/ Derived as [r - g - r(1+g) + ea(1+r)]/(1+g+r+gr) times previous period debt stock, w ith r = nominal effective interest rate on external debt; r = change in domestic GDP deflator in US dollar terms, g = real GDP grow th rate,
e = nominal appreciation (increase in dollar value of domestic currency), and a = share of domestic-currency denominated debt in total external debt.
2/ The contribution from price and exchange rate changes is defined as [-r(1+g) + ea(1+r)]/(1+g+r+gr) times previous period debt stock. r increases w ith an appreciating domestic currency (e > 0) and rising inflation (GDP deflator).
3/ Projections also reflect the impact of price and exchange rate changes, inflow s of extraordinary financing (and Fund repurchases). The large projected residuals in 2011 and 2013 reflect the imapct of large payments by the
oldbanks w hich (discretely) reduce external debt w ith an associated simultaneous decline in foreign assets accumulated during the asset recovery phase.
4/ Defined as current account deficit, plus amortization on medium- and long-term debt, plus short-term debt at end of previous period.
5/ The key variables include real GDP grow th; nominal interest rate; dollar deflator grow th; and both non-interest current account and non-debt inflow s in percent of GDP.
6/ Long-run, constant balance that stabilizes the debt ratio assuming that key variables (real GDP grow th, nominal interest rate, dollar deflator grow th, and non-debt inflow s in percent of GDP) remain at their levels
of the last projection year. This estimate excludes old bank-related asset recovery in 2014, and large one-off projected liquidation of assets abroad, to service lumpy debt payment.
7/ Historical debt and interest data exclude old bank data (based on staff and Central Bank estimates).

1/ General government gross debt (including borrowing by the central government to support central bank reserves; excludes IMF loans).
2/ Derived as [(r - (1+g - g + (1+r]/(1+g++g)) times previous period debt ratio, with r = interest rate;  = growth rate of GDP deflator; g = real GDP growth rate;  = share of foreign-currency
denominated debt; and  = nominal exchange rate depreciation (measured by increase in local currency value of U.S. dollar).
3/ The real interest rate contribution is derived from the denominator in footnote 2/ as r - π (1+g) and the real growth contribution as -g.
4/ The exchange rate contribution is derived from the numerator in footnote 2/ as (1+r).
5/ Reflects called guarantees of the State Guarantee Fund.
6/ Includes capitalization of new banks, savings banks, and bilateral loans and international bond issuance to support CBI reserves.
7/ For projections, this line includes exchange rate changes. In 2009-17, the residual also reflects use of deposits at the central bank and sale of financial assets obtained during the financial crisis.
8/ Defined as general government deficit, plus amortization of medium and long-term general government debt, plus short-term debt at end of previous period.
9/ Assumes that key variables (real GDP growth, real interest rate, and other identified debt-creating flows) remain at the level of the last projection year.

APPENDIX II. THE RESOLUTION OF ICELAND’S FAILED COMMERCIAL BANKS
In October 2008, Iceland’s three largest
commercial banks, accounting for 85 percent
of the financial system, failed within a single
week. The external liabilities of these banks
(500 percent of GDP) accounted for most of
Iceland’s external liabilities. By the end of 2008
each of the three banks was split up into an
“old” and a “new” bank where the majority of
domestic assets and liabilities of the old banks
were transferred to establish the new domestic
banks. The old banks are currently undergoing
winding up procedures, and in this resolution
process is likely that many of the priority
claims will be fulfilled, but the use of funds
from domestic recovery to cover foreign claims
will, over time, put pressure on either reserves
or the value of the krona.
Resolution, Winding-up and Creation of the
New Banks
Iceland’s Emergency Act (Act No.125/2008),
passed on October 6, 2008 gave the FME,
under extraordinary circumstances, extensive
powers to intervene in financial companies.
Under this authority Resolution Committees
(RCs) were appointed to manage the three
largest old banks: Landsbanki on October 7,
Glitnir on October 8, and Kaupthing on
October 9, 2008. Soon after each bank was
granted a moratorium over its obligations,
which was, in time, extended up to the 24
month legal limit. An amendment to the
Financial Undertakings Act in 2009 clarified
that the objective of the moratorium was to
ensure that the normal progress of the old
bank’s winding-up, and that once the
moratorium expired, the banks should
automatically be regarded as being under
winding up procedures. Winding up Boards
(WB) were appointed for all three old banks in
the first half of 2009, and from this time each

50

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

old bank’s estate was managed jointly by its
RC and WB. The RCs manage the old banks’
daily operations and assets, while the WBs
manage claims (including their recognition and
payment) against the old banks’ estates. The
three old banks all formally entered windingup procedures on November 22, 2010.
Under the Emergency Act, deposits (including,
unusually, wholesale deposits) in the old banks
were assigned higher priority than general
claims. The deposits in domestic branches and
domestic assets of the failed banks were
transferred to newly-created domestic banks:
New Landsbanki, Arion Banki, and
Islandsbanki. After protracted negotiations the
differences in the value of the assets and
liabilities transferred from Glitnir to
Islandsbanki and from Kaupthing to Arion
Banki were settled through equity, making the
old banks majority owners of the new banks. In
the case of Landsbanki, the settlement
included some equity (though the state
retained a majority share) as well as bonds,
including a bond contingent on the
performance of certain ring-fenced assets of
the new bank. Consequently, asset recovery in
the three estates depends on the performance
of the new banks.
The old banks could emerge from winding-up
as companies owned by their creditors. That is,
their resolution can end either with liquidation
(where recovered funds are paid out to
creditors in terms of priority), or with
composition (where the old bank becomes a
financial holding company with its creditors as
shareholders). On June 10, 2011, further
amendments to the Financial Undertakings Act
made resolution through composition more
likely, at least for two of the old banks. These
amendments included: the termination of the

ICELAND

three RCs at end-2011, a limitation on the
ability of the estates to make interim payments
to non-priority unsecured creditors ahead of
composition, and a revised voting regime for
the decision to enter composition. The
amendments do not preclude lump-sum
payments to priority creditors before
composition (with Landsbanki making such a
payment in December 2011), or by the new
entity after composition to a broader set of
creditors.
Financial Position of the Old Banks
Balance sheet. The currently anticipated value
of asset recovery should more than cover the
reported priority claims on two of the banks,
and mostly cover the priority claims on the
third. While considerable uncertainty exists
over the balance sheets of the old banks, the
valuation of their assets is becoming clearer. At
end-2010, the fair value of assets was ISK
2.8 trillion (around $24½ billion), an increase
during 2010 of around 11½ percent excluding
the impact of exchange rate changes. Strong
asset recovery continued into 2011 (Table 1).
Most of the increase is due to recovered loans,
some of which became equity holdings
(through seizure of collateral). The currency of
old banks’ cash holdings largely reflect the
currency in which its assets were recovered. As
a result, only a small share of cash assets is in
krona, while the share of cash deposits
maintained in Iceland varies considerably
across the three banks. The liabilities of the old
banks were fixed in ISK on April 22, 2009
(under the bankruptcy act), but most claims,
including priority claims, remain subject to
litigation.

domestically will, over time, affect either
Iceland’s foreign reserve holdings or the value
of the krona. While the separation of the old
and new banks was intended to leave the

failed banks’ estates with only foreign assets
and liabilities, the actual partition was not so
clean.
At present it seems likely that, for the three old
banks, the extent of foreign claims eventually
to be paid will be greater than their foreign
assets (Table 2). Legitimate domestic claims on
all the old banks could be as much as
15 percent of total claims (CBI, 2011),
suggesting a value for the payment of foreign
claims of around ISK 2½ trillion. With the
anticipated recovery from foreign assets
around ISK 1¾ trillion, the net foreign liability
of the old banks is estimated at around ISK
800 billion. As domestic funds are transferred
overseas to settle these claims, there will be
pressure on the balance of payments, affecting
either reserves or the value of the krona.
However there could be some offsetting
foreign inflows that mitigate these effects
through foreign equity participation in the new
banks.

Safeguards Assessment: The 2009
assessment concluded that the CBI's overall
control environment was broadly appropriate
for a small central bank, with good controls in
the accounting and financial reporting area.
The CBI's external and internal audit
procedures practices were not found to be in
line with international practices, however, and
the foreign reserves management area would
benefit from development. The authorities
have already taken steps to implement
safeguard recommendations, notably by
appointing an international audit firm under
the auspices of the Auditor General to conduct

annual external audits of the CBI in line with
international standards, starting with financial
year 2009. Internal audit was also outsourced.
Work on other recommendations, such as the
reserves management guidelines, is in
progress.
Last Article IV Consultation: Discussions for
the 2010 Article IV Consultation were held in
Reykjavik during June 14–28, 2010 and
July 19–22, 2010. The Staff Report (country
report No. 10/176) was considered by the
Executive Board on September 29, 2010.
Article IV consultations with Iceland are
currently held on a 12-month cycle.

STATISTICAL ISSUES
Data provision to the Fund is adequate for
surveillance purposes. Iceland subscribed to
the Special Data Dissemination Standard
(SDDS) in 1996, and is in observance of the
SDDS specifications for coverage, periodicity,
and timeliness, but uses a flexibility option on
the timeliness and periodicity for the
production index and the producer price index
(PPI). The Statistics Department (STA) prepared
a data module of the Report on the
Observance of Standards and Codes (data
ROSC) that was published on November 22,
2005.
Data on a wide range of economic and
financial variables are provided to the Fund in
a timely manner during and between
consultations. In addition to periodic press
releases, statistical information is disseminated
to the public through a range of monthly,
quarterly, and annual publications by three
main institutions (The Central Bank of Iceland
(CBI), the Ministry of Finance, and Statistics
Iceland), and is increasingly available on their
internet sites. Provision of electronic data in
English has improved substantially in recent
years, especially from Statistics Iceland.
As regards the national accounts data, the
authorities shifted to ESA95 in August 2000
and revised the corresponding time series
back to 1990. Another revision was carried out
in 2002. A breakdown is disseminated by
industry back to the beginning of the
production approach in 1973. Data on GNP
and national income, in current and constant
prices, as well as data on net savings for the

4

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

economy as a whole, are also disseminated.
The quarterly data are seasonally adjusted.
The authorities publish a Treasury cash flow
statement on a monthly basis, quarterly data
on the general government operations, and
annual data on the general government
operations and financial assets and liabilities.
Iceland reports government finance statistics
in accordance with the GFSM 2001 framework
in the GFS Yearbook, and is an up-to-date
contributor to the International Financial
Statistics (IFS). Balance of payments data
deviate from the IMF’s Balance of Payments
Manual, fifth edition (BPM5) in certain
respects. In particular, the CBI follows the
methodology applied by the European Central
Bank (ECB) for the calculation of income
payable by collective investment institutions
(e.g., mutual funds).
The CBI made good progress in improving
external sector statistics based on 2011 TA
mission’s recommendations. Particularly, (i) the
coverage was expanded by including the data
on portfolio investment in equity capital, as
well as in securities on secondary market; (ii)
data on FDI and on other investment income
are compiled in line with balance of payments
methodology; (iii) remittances data were
improved based on information from money
transfer operators; and (iv) the old banks’
transactions are recorded broken down by
instruments.
On monetary and financial statistics, the
concepts and definitions broadly conform to

ICELAND

the guidelines of the Monetary and Financial
Statistics Manual (MFSM). Departing from the
MFSM, M3/Broad Money measure includes
deposits of the central government, positions
of commercial banks with private nonfinancial
corporations include some positions with
public nonfinancial corporations, and the latter
include some positions with private
nonfinancial corporations. Beginning in
February 2010, the CBI reports for publication
in IFS monetary data for central bank and
other depository corporations using the
Standardized Report Forms (SRFs).

Statement by the Staff Representative on Iceland
Executive Board Meeting
April 6, 2012
This statement provides an update on developments since the Staff Report was issued.
These developments do not alter the thrust of the Staff Appraisal.
On March 21, the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) raised policy interest rates by 25
bps, in line with the tightening bias identified in the last two meetings and staff’s policy
advice. The MPC voiced concern about the deterioration in the inflation outlook. The
seasonal weakening of the krona, exacerbated by ongoing pressures related to the repayment
of external debt, poses a risk to the inflation forecast, given the high exchange rate passthrough to prices in Iceland. Inflation expectations, measured by both breakeven rates and
survey data, have also increased.
The Special Prosecutor, in coordination with the CBI's Capital Controls Surveillance
Unit, is investigating a fishing company for possible circumvention of the capital
controls. Under the capital controls, exporters (including fishing companies) are required to
repatriate their export proceeds. Monitoring compliance with this obligation is difficult partly
because exporters have subsidiaries overseas, over which the Icelandic authorities’
jurisdiction is limited. This investigation is unprecedented and represents an intensification of
the authorities’ efforts to enforce the capital controls.
The CBI is continuing to implement its capital account liberalization strategy. On March
28, it carried out the second in a sequence of planned auctions intended to match holders of
offshore krona wanting to buy foreign exchange with investors willing to bring in foreign
currency to invest in government securities or long-term investment projects in Iceland (the
so-called “FDI route”). The CBI received bids for a total amount of euro 92.9 million, out of
which euro 22.5 million were accepted. The bulk of accepted bids were under the FDI route
while only modest amount were allocated to government securities. The variation in bids
between this and the previous auction, together with the low acceptance rate for this round,
illustrate the challenge in lifting capital controls.

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2012 Article IV Consultation with Iceland
and Ex Post Evaluation of Exceptional Access
Under the 2008 Stand-By Arrangement
The Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded the 2012 Article IV
consultation with Iceland 1 on April 6, 2012.
Background
Iceland is gradually emerging from its post-crisis recession. The economy expanded by
3 percent in 2011 driven by a broad-based rebound in consumption and a gradual pick-up in
investment. Unemployment declined steadily and now stands at around 7 percent. The trade
balance continued to post strong surpluses, but the krona nonetheless depreciated—in part
reflecting repayments of foreign debt by the private sector. International reserves increased
sharply on account of IMF program disbursements, international sovereign bond issuance, and
the drawing of bilateral loans. Financial markets became more active, but remained dominated
by the government bond market.
The fiscal consolidation initiated in 2009 is continuing, but at a slower pace than previously
expected. Expenditure overruns materialized in 2011 and the primary deficit will now reach
1 percent of GDP (compared with ¼ percent of GDP expected previously).

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On
return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the
Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the
Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the
country's authorities. An explanation of any qualifiers used in summings up can be found here:

Inflation increased in 2011 and now stands well above the central bank’s target of 2½ percent.
Krona depreciation, wage and commodity price increases pushed inflation up and prompted the
central bank to tighten policy twice in 2011. Yet, inflation expectations have remained largely
above the target and monetary policy remains accommodative with real policy rates in negative
territory.
Regarding the financial sector, banks reported strong profits, high capital, and large liquidity
buffers. Although the latest Supreme Court decision will likely have an adverse effect on banks’
capital position, banks expect the impact to be manageable. The ongoing restructuring of
household and corporate debt has led to a notable decline in Non-Performing Loans (NPLs)
from 40 percent in 2010 to 23 percent.
As part of their reserve management strategy, Iceland in March made early repayments of
repurchases of most of its Fund obligations falling due in 2013 (around 20 percent of the total).
Reserve adequacy in 2012 and 2013 will be somewhat weaker compared with no early
repayments, but the ratio of gross reserves to short term debt is projected remain well above
100 percent. 2
Executive Board Assessment
Directors commended Iceland’s emerging recovery and significant achievements in restoring
macroeconomic and financial stability. In March, Iceland made an early repayment of part of its
obligations under the Stand-By Arrangement. Given the persistence of external as well as
domestic risks, strong commitment to prudent policies and focus on addressing remaining
challenges will nevertheless remain crucial.
Directors stressed the importance of completing the fiscal consolidation. They called for
additional measures to put the medium-term fiscal path back on track, and for contingency
measures to guard against implementation risks. They welcomed the authorities’ commitment to
their medium-term fiscal plan and their efforts to strengthen the fiscal framework.
Directors supported a gradual tightening of monetary policy to help bring down inflation, anchor
inflation expectations, and support capital account liberalization. They noted the impact that
further wage increases could have on inflation and competitiveness. Regarding the future
monetary regime, Directors supported the near-term priority being given to strengthening the
existing monetary framework, including through the introduction of macroprudential tools.

Directors underscored that lifting capital controls is a key challenge. They agreed that the pace
of liberalization should be guided by the balance of payments outlook, reserve adequacy, and
the need to safeguard financial stability, noting that additional time may be needed given
continuing global uncertainties. At the same time, risks associated with the prolonged
maintenance of controls should be kept in mind. Noting the recent removal of certain
exemptions from controls as a way to mitigate risks of rapid liberalization, Directors underscored
the need to publish the new rules on exemptions as quickly as possible to help guide investor
and public expectations.
Directors welcomed the progress on private sector debt restructuring, and looked forward to the
swift completion of the process. They cautioned against additional untargeted household debt
relief, which would not fully address the needs of households in greatest distress and strain
public finances.
Directors called for further efforts to address the remaining risks and vulnerabilities in the
banking system. They welcomed the progress made in strengthening the banking system and
reducing nonperforming loans. They underscored the need to continue to address legacy
vulnerabilities and to monitor closely how banks recognize income, notably from restructured
and nonperforming loans. They considered that dividend payments should continue to be
disallowed to ensure that banks maintain high capital buffers while vulnerabilities are still being
addressed. Directors encouraged the authorities to further strengthen supervision, including by
continuing to address supervisory gaps and preserving the independence of the Financial
Supervisory Authority (FME).
Directors agreed with the key findings of the ex post evaluation. They concurred that the
program has achieved its objectives, owing to strong ownership and good program design.
They noted that the program was flexible and managed risks well, including through bank
restructuring that limited the public sector burden and through the use of capital controls.
Agreement on a fiscal adjustment consistent with the authorities’ objective of preserving
Iceland’s social model was key in easing the social impact of the crisis and fostering program
ownership.

Statement by Benny Andersen, Executive Director for Iceland
And Lilja Alfredsdottir, Advisor to Executive Director
April 6, 2012
The Icelandic authorities welcome the 2012 Article IV and Ex Post Evaluation reports. The
Evaluation report confirms the favorable results of the cooperative effort of the Fund and the
Icelandic authorities in combating the 2008 financial crisis. The Selected Issues papers
provide very useful analyses on possible fiscal rules and ways to strengthen the present
inflation targeting framework.
Our authorities find the staff assessment of the economic situation and outlook in the Article
IV report to be realistic. We agree that, at this juncture, many challenges remain and there is
no room for complacency. Our authorities intend to go further along the path of fiscal
consolidation, and cautious liberalization of capital controls, while at the same time aiming to
anchor inflation and inflation expectations, as well as providing support for broad based
economic growth and diversification.
Economic Growth
Economic growth measured at 3.1 percent in 2011, mainly driven by private consumption and
business investment. Some moderation of consumption growth is expected this year as the
effects of temporary policy measures taper off. Public consumption is expected to contract in
2012 but an increase in private sector investment and FDI is expected to offset this. Staff’s
medium-term growth projections are in line with our assessment.
Staff projects an underlying current account surplus for the year 2012 and that a surplus will
persist over the medium term. The trade balance is expected to remain in surplus, but at a
lower level this year and be somewhat weaker in the next couple of years due to the high
import content of planned investment projects. Similarly, net exports will initially make a
negative contribution to growth, but it should turn positive when this investment phase tapers
off and the associated exports come on stream. This is broadly in line with our assessment.
Several risks to the growth outlook are discussed by staff. Our authorities agree that the main
risk relates to the uncertain outlook in the main trading partner countries in Europe. Slower
growth in Europe might depress export prices and limit the growth in tourism as well as
constrain market access to new finance. While these risks are difficult to mitigate, there is
some scope for trade redirection. Although Icelandic exporters have been quite agile in terms
of seeking new markets, it is costly and a severe slowdown in Europe would also have global
consequences.
Investment and Natural Resource Management
The role of government policies is to support private sector growth by providing infrastructure
and services in addition to a regulatory framework conducive to entrepreneurship and a
competitive spirit. A new public investment plan for 2013-2020 is being prepared that aims to
coordinate public investment in areas such as transport and regional development. The tax
system will be improved to further potential new businesses and strengthen competiveness. A

2

new framework for natural resource utilization is in the final stages. This framework will
provide guidance for future utilization and help to resolve environmental issues. New
legislation on the management of the fishing resources has been put before the Parliament.
This new legislation aims to address the long standing debate on the quota system and
distribution of the resource rent. The central proposal is a levy that aims to increase the level
of resource rent directed towards public funds in favorable years. Investment in the energy
sector includes a medium sized hydropower plant under construction that will supply
additional electricity to an aluminum smelter that is being upgraded for increased production
of higher value output.
Debt and Unemployment
High private sector indebtedness could put a brake on consumption and investment. Debt
restructuring has progressed and uncertainty regarding the treatment of foreign index-linked
loans should be reduced over time, once there is greater clarity on how to interpret the recent
High Court rulings. However, the private sector debt crisis is not over. More work is needed
and our authorities are fully aware that fiscal space for untargeted debt relief is not there.
Unemployment is still unacceptably high. Staff projects the rate to be above four percent in
the medium term. This is still a historically high number for Iceland and the goal will be to
achieve a better outcome in the near term. The government has introduced several measures to
combat unemployment and satisfy demand for specialized workers including a special fund,
financed by employers and pension funds, to support education of unemployed people and
retraining.
Fiscal Policy
After implementing a fiscal consolidation of over 9 percent of GDP mostly in the two year
period 2009-2010, some expenditure overruns in 2011 increased the primary general
government deficit to one percent of GDP. Staff estimates that this implies that the 2012
primary surplus will be positive but lower than previously envisaged. Staff proposes
additional measures amounting to 1/2 percent of GDP to correct the course in 2012. Despite
the observed slippages, our authorities still aim to achieve their medium term objectives: an
overall balance in 2014 and a sizable surplus thereafter. Given the uncertainty concerning
growth and the external environment, our authorities believe that it would be prudent to
closely monitor developments in 2012 and stand ready to support a stronger primary balance
in the 2013 budget proposal. Sale of assets and possible higher income from the natural
resource tax on fisheries could contribute. The finances of several local governments are
being restructured under the auspices of the Ministry of Interior. A new legislation on local
government finances will help to lower debt and prevent overruns.
There is always a scope for improvement in the conduct of public finances. The Fund has
provided valuable technical assistance to our authorities in particular to prepare for legislation
for the new organic budget law. Progress in the legislative area will help our authorities in
their resolve to avoid any decisions that undermine the consolidation achievements of recent
years. The Selected Issues paper offers analysis on possible fiscal rules for Iceland. There

3

seems to be no clear cut best alternative but staff recommends a procedural fiscal rule with
clear numerical objectives. For the next years, the overarching goal of public finances is debt
reduction to close in on the 60 percent Maastricht criterion in the period 2016-2019. This goal
will set the constraints for public finances in the near term.
Monetary Policy
Inflation and inflation expectations have been stubbornly above the Central Bank’s (CBI)
target of 2.5 percent. The twelve month rate is now 6.4 percent. At its meeting in March, the
Monetary Policy Committee increased the policy rate by 0.25 percent to 5 percent and the
Committee has signaled further rate increases as necessary. Recent wage increases were inter
alia fuelled by high profitability in the tradable sector, due to the low exchange rate, that
trickled down to the non-tradable sector through the centralized wage bargaining process in
Iceland. The relatively weak ISK and high oil prices have added to inflation pressures due to
the rapid pass-through of import prices to domestic consumer prices. The CBI expects the
inflation target to be reached in 2014, somewhat later than previously expected.
The Icelandic experience has shown the challenges of an inflation targeting framework when
applied in a very small, open and financially integrated economy, in the absence of
supplementary policy tools, such as macro-prudential tools to limit destabilizing credit
expansion. The Selected Issues paper, on monetary policy analyses the pros and cons of
possible additional tools to strengthen the existing inflation targeting framework. Our
authorities note the key finding that additional tools are not a substitute for effective monetary
policy implementation through the standard interest rate tool. This should also be augmented
by the need for supportive fiscal and structural policies.
An important debate on the future monetary regime is taking place in Iceland, including on
prospects for EU membership and appropriate strategy for entering the ERM and
subsequently adopting the euro. A comprehensive CBI report on alternative exchange rate
regimes is expected to be out this spring.
Capital Controls and Amendment to the Act on Foreign Exchange
The capital controls are seen as temporary emergency measures that our authorities will
abolish as soon as conditions permit. Lifting the controls is, as staff underlines, a pressing
challenge. Two auctions of foreign currency for “off-shore” ISK have been held so far this
year and further auctions are planned in the spring. The auction’s aim to relieve the pressure
from the most distressed ISK holdings, by attracting long-term investors that are willing to
hold ISK assets for a minimum period of 5 years. Other measures will follow. Recently the
Parliament strengthened the capital controls legislation to prevent loop-holes that turned out to
be a more serious problem than previously anticipated, with adverse balance of payments
effects. These measures should strengthen confidence in the controls. If controls are to be
credible, they must be effectively enforced.
An important measure aimed at preventing serious balance of payments disruptions was a
change to the foreign exchange legislation which brought the operations of the winding-up
boards of the old banks under the auspices of the legislation. The amended legislation is

4

expected to have limited, if any, effect on payments to priority creditors. Gross payments to
non-residents out of the estate of the old banks are equivalent to about half of Iceland’s GDP
and net payments about 1/3 of GDP. The risk of a disorderly process, e.g. race of the various
winding-up boards for the exit, is substantial and was eventually deemed to be unacceptably
high. The current legislation provides the CBI with means to better monitor and remove
incentives for a disorderly process, e.g. a rush for the exit. In order to facilitate an orderly
process, after consulting with the winding-up boards, the CBI will shortly issue regulations
that provide general exemptions for the winding-up boards to enable them to pay out the
proceeds of asset sales that do not entail balance of payment problems. The aim of the
regulation is to create appropriate incentives for the winding-up boards that reduce the risk of
co-ordination failure. This will both protect the domestic economy as well as the creditors.
Their most valuable domestic assets, including two of the three large commercial banks, are
highly sensitive to economic stability.
In March 2012, a prepayment of SDR 289m to the IMF and 366m euros to the Nordic
countries was announced. The amount is slightly above 20 percent of funding connected with
the SBA. The prepayments aim to lower short term debt and the cost of holding large reserves
at the CBI. If conditions permit, further prepayments will be considered.
Financial Sector
All three major banks have now published their 2011 accounts. They have demonstrated their
ability to earn moderate profits despite the difficult environment especially as regards the high
ratio of NPLs. However, there has been a significant reduction in NPLs as they have been
halved to 23 percent and are expected to be lower at the end of 2012. Also, write-offs
following the High Court rulings on FX indexed loans were absorbed by the banks and
showed up through lower profits in 2011 than was the case in 2010. Our authorities agree with
staff that high capital buffers are still needed and dividend payments should be postponed. An
important step would be for banks to regain access to foreign capital markets. At least one
bank’s foreign issuance is advanced in the preparation process. A successful issuance would
increase the maneuvering space for the banks and help to create buffers against the holdings
of foreign owned deposits in the banks.
Financial supervision has continued to improve mainly through the strengthening of the
Financial Supervisory Authority (FME) both in terms of manpower and regulatory tools.
Coordination between the CBI and FME has been enhanced and its structure improved. The
goal is compliance with Basel Core Principles for Effective Supervision. The banking system
is operating within capital controls and a blanket guarantee on deposit insurance that act as
shield but also hindrance to robust growth and profitability. Our authorities are considering
ways to improve this environment, and a new report on the Future of the Financial System in
Iceland has been published by the Ministry of Economic Affairs. This report provides analysis
and proposals that serve as a background for discussion and policy making for improved
financial sector environment, including the legislative and regulatory framework.
