I. INTRODUCTION
1.
Uzbekistan has great economic potential that remains to be fully exploited. It is
the most populous country in Central Asia, with a strong agricultural base and abundant
natural resources, including hydrocarbons, gold, copper, and uranium. Since the early 2000s,
Uzbekistan has benefited from a favorable external environment and undertaken significant
macroeconomic adjustment. However, government controls have remained pervasive,
stunting the development of the private sector. Although per capita income has increased
steadily, about one-quarter of the population is still considered poor.
2.
The effectiveness of Fund surveillance in Uzbekistan has been mixed. While the
authorities have adopted more appropriate fiscal and, to some extent, monetary policies,
progress toward establishing a market economy and in addressing banking and data issues
has been slow. Advice to liberalize international trade has not yet been taken up.
3.
The discussions focused on three main policy issues: reducing inflation,
developing the banking sector, and liberalizing foreign trade.
II. RECENT ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS
4.
During 2005–06, GDP growth and the balance of payments were strong, but
inflation remained high (Table 1). According to official statistics, GDP growth of just over
7 percent was driven by agriculture, industry, and transport and communications (Figure 1).
On the expenditure side, growth was supported by external demand. The current account
registered large surpluses due to

Monetary policy was accommodative in 2005, but tightened in 2006 (Figure 4,
Tables 3 and 4). In 2005, the sharp accumulation of NFA by the CBU was only partially
sterilized by a decline in NDA, resulting in surging reserve and broad money. In 2006,
reserve accumulation accelerated, even though the CBU slowed the rate of nominal
depreciation. Nevertheless, the authorities tightened monetary policy significantly via
increased deposits from banks, the resumption of the issuance of central bank paper, and the
accumulation of government deposits, including through the newly created Fund for
Reconstruction and Development (FRD).1 As a result, growth of monetary aggregates
decelerated considerably.

The sum was de facto pegged to the dollar during the second half of 2006. The
sum has been stable against the U.S. dollar within a two percent band since mid-2006 while
the CBU’s one-sided interventions resulted in steady reserve accumulation (Figure 5).

Fiscal policy continued to outperform budget projections (Figure 6, Tables 5 and
6). Budget financing shows a surplus of 1.3 percent of GDP in 2005, while the authorities
reported a small deficit compared to a budgeted deficit of over 3 percent of GDP. The

small surplus, compared to the budgeted deficit of 3 percent of GDP. The overall fiscal
surplus, including the FRD, is estimated at 3.1 percent of GDP.
8.
Structural reforms continued at a gradual pace. Tax reforms continued to improve
collections and ease the tax burden, and treasury reforms accelerated to enhance fiscal
management. Licensing, inspections, and reporting were streamlined and the restructuring of
agricultural enterprises (shirkats) into private farms has been mostly completed.
Furthermore, restrictions on banks’ access to their correspondent accounts at the CBU and
cash withdrawals from bank deposits were eased, and a real time gross settlement system was
introduced. However, privatization has stalled, a poor investment climate has resulted in low
FDI inflows, and the banking system remains underdeveloped.
III. ECONOMIC OUTLOOK
9.
Economic growth and the balance of payments are likely to remain strong in the
short term. The authorities project GDP growth to exceed 7½ percent in 2007, supported by
strong external demand and driven by industrial production of petrochemicals, machinery,
and textiles. The current account surplus is projected to remain very large and official
reserves are expected to continue to increase. The authorities target a decline in inflation in
2007 and, to this end, intend to further tighten monetary policy and continue to pursue
cautious fiscal policy.
10.
The authorities have ambitious growth objectives over the medium-term. Their
Welfare Improvement Strategy Paper (WISP)2 envisages annual growth of 8–8½ percent by
the end of this decade, with the private sector share in the economy increasing to 55 percent
of GDP by 2010, from about 40 percent in 2006, and the poverty level declining 50 percent
by 2015. The authorities expect strong external demand to support growth in the short run,
while investment will play an increasing role over the medium term. Staff believes that these
ambitious growth objectives would materialize only if trade is substantially liberalized, credit
to the private sector picks up, confidence in the banking system is enhanced, and the difficult
business environment improves. In the absence of a change of gear in these areas, staff
projects GDP growth to remain at about 7 percent, supported by external demand.3 Import
growth is projected to remain at about current levels, while export growth is expected to
moderate reflecting terms of trade and external demand forecasts. Debt sustainability

Expected to be submitted to the World Bank in mid-2007.

During 2007–11, Uzbekistan’s terms of trade (TOT) will improve by 20 percent, outpacing other CIS
countries’ TOT. A 10 percent decline in the prices of gold and cotton during the same period will narrow the
annual current account surplus by about 1¼ percent of GDP on average.

8

analysis indicates that both external and public debt should remain manageable, even under
standard stress tests (Tables 7–10).
IV. POLICY CHALLENGES
A. Policies to Reduce Inflation
11.
The authorities are convinced of the need to reduce inflation. The rapid reserve
accumulation and the consequent monetary expansion, combined with an almost doubling of
public sector wages and pensions in the past two years, heightened inflationary pressures.
Administered price increases—of 35 percent during the past two years—also contributed to,
and were considered by the authorities as the main factor behind, inflationary pressures. The
authorities intend to limit reserve money growth to about 30 percent in 2007 by sterilizing
excess liquidity using indirect monetary instruments and accumulating deposits in the FRD.
Coupled with a continuation of declining velocity, this should be consistent with a further
reduction in inflation in 2007. Given the strong balance of payments outlook and assuming a
stable cash-to-deposit ratio, such a policy stance would allow a small increase in credit to the
private sector. The CBU expects the fiscal outturn to be better-than-projected and the cashto-deposit ratio to decline, creating more room for credit to the economy. The authorities
intend to keep the refinance rate at its current level of 14 percent.4
12.
Combining proactive use of monetary policy instruments with a flexible
exchange rate policy will help combat inflation. The authorities explained that their
current policy aims for small depreciations of the real effective exchange rate (REER), by
targeting nominal depreciation of the sum, to maintain competitiveness. This had resulted in
rapid monetary expansion and high inflation, and failed to achieve a real depreciation. Staff
argued that allowing nominal appreciation by reducing official intervention to build reserves
would take some pressure off indirect monetary policy instruments, while creating room for
further credit growth to the economy.5 Moreover, external sector developments suggest the
sum could be significantly undervalued and that efforts to resist real appreciation would
therefore likely continue to be unsuccessful and inflationary, and would not be desirable
(Box 1). Although the authorities are currently targeting a small nominal depreciation during
2007, they would be prepared to consider a more flexible exchange rate policy, if warranted
by economic developments, in particular regarding inflation and the balance of payments.

4

5

The refinance rate is not an effective policy instrument given the weak transmission mechanism.

According to the authorities, the first-round pass-through of nominal appreciation to inflation is about
15 percent, but exchange rate pass-through to inflation is difficult to assess, mainly because of import
restrictions.

9

Box 1. Uzbekistan: An Assessment of the Exchange Rate Level
Uzbekistan’s current account surplus (at nearly 20 percent of GDP ) is expected to be
among the largest in the CIS region in 2006. Uzbekistan has benefited from a surge in
remittances and one of the strongest TOT improvement in the CIS countries since 2002
(Figure 1). In 2006, non-commodity exports growth (43 percent) outpaced commodity export
growth (11 percent). The strong current account performance has resulted in major
accumulation of net foreign assets.

Despite the strong balance of payments, the REER and the nominal effective exchange
rate (NEER) have remained relatively stable since the substantial depreciation during
2001–03 (Figure 2). The moderate appreciation of the REER since 2005, reflecting higher
inflation, has not adversely affected export performance.
Analysis of the equilibrium real exchange rate suggests that the real effective exchange
rate is undervalued.
¾
According to the purchasing
power parity approach, the real effective
exchange rate is undervalued by about
30 percent compared with its predicted
level taking into account Uzbekistan’s
relative income (Figure 3).
The structural current account
balance is estimated at a surplus of about
4 percent of GDP, much lower than the
surpluses registered in recent years.1

13.
The authorities feel that fiscal policy should support the anti-inflation effort.
Accordingly, the overall government budget (including the FRD) is projected to register a
surplus of 2.9 percent of GDP in 2007, despite a reduction in taxes to promote private sector
activity. This would imply fiscal loosening of 0.7 percent of GDP, but this estimate may not
fully reflect prospects for continued significant over-performance relative to the budget.
Given the low level of public debt, lower inflation would provide room over the medium
term for small fiscal deficits, implying scope for moderate fiscal loosening to finance higher
social and infrastructure expenditures. Meanwhile, the authorities do not favor shifting
toward more capital expenditure by refraining from large increases in public sector salaries
and pensions. They argued that further income growth is needed to help offset the impact of
bringing administered prices closer to market levels. They intend to continue their tax
reforms, strengthen fiscal management, and consolidate the FRD’s operations into the fiscal
reporting in 2007.
B. Reform of the Banking System
14.
The banking sector is undergoing structural changes and the prudential ratios
exceed minimum standards (Tables 11 and 12). Spurred by legal reforms, banks are
developing their business in consumer lending, real estate, and SME financing.
Consequently, there has been some move to more local currency and longer-term lending to
private sector. Banks have also been active in channeling remittances into Uzbekistan.
According to official data, banks’ risk-weighted capital adequacy ratios are well above the
minimum requirement and non-performing loans are declining. Solvency ratios seem robust
to exchange rate shocks and a rise in non-performing loans.6 However, the strength of banks’
balance sheets partly reflects the large proportion of government-guaranteed loans, which
carry a zero risk weight. With the government no longer issuing guarantees for loans and
foreign funding, the banking system will need to manage its balance sheets more
conventionally in the future. In this context, the authorities recently increased the minimum
capital requirements.
15.
Financial intermediation, however, remains subdued (Figure 7). Monetization
remains low. Growth in cash-in-circulation is faster than that of deposits. Credit growth is
low and the credit-to-GDP ratio continues to decline. The banking system’s inability to fulfill
successfully its intermediation role is due to two main factors:
•

6

Strong growth in net foreign assets has limited the room for credit expansion given
the tight monetary framework designed to control the growth of reserve money; and

A 55 percent appreciation of the sum against the dollar and a doubling of non-performing loans would bring
the capital adequacy ratio close to the minimum level of 10 percent.

11

•

The low level of confidence in banks discourages deposits, limiting banks’ ability to
grow.

16.
Market participants associated the low level of confidence in the banking sector
mainly with the role of banks in financial oversight and implementing government
treasury operations, including through expenditure and tax collection. They also identified
the following constraints to banking sector development: the existence of restrictions on cash
withdrawals from banks; the obligation for enterprises to make daily deposits of cash
receipts; and the interference by local authorities in the activities of the banking system.
17.
The authorities believe that banks’ role in the economy should be enhanced
through incentives rather than administrative measures. They indicated that problems
with cash withdrawals from banks no longer existed, but suggested that the adoption of the
anti-money laundering legislation, which brought large transactions under inspection, could
be discouraging deposits. They intend to relieve banks from non-core activities following the
completion of government treasury reforms, expected by end-2007.

12

C. Trade Liberalization
18.
Uzbekistan’s trade regime is protective and complex. The authorities maintain
barriers to trade to shelter domestic production. Import tariffs are among the highest in the
region (Text Table 1). In addition, direct and indirect taxes are levied on imported goods and
an implicit tax on imports originates from the differentiated application of excise taxes to
imported and domestically produced goods. Moreover, the import process is complex and
time-consuming.

Current trade policies distort resource allocation, reduce competition,
contribute to the difficult business environment (Box 2), create opportunities for
corruption, and encourage smuggling. The authorities indicated that the new customs
code, to be submitted to the Cabinet of Ministers in early 2007, would consolidate
regulations and bring them in compliance with international standards, but would not include
measures to liberalize trade. The authorities noted that multilateral trade liberalization would
be considered in the context of WTO accession.
V. OTHER ISSUES
20.
There are reports by some market participants of restrictions on currency
convertibility in the second half of 2006. Foreign exchange sales for imports of consumer
goods have remained relatively constant at a low level since mid-2006, and a small premium
appeared in the curb foreign exchange market. The authorities denied the existence of
restrictions and argued that given the strong balance of payments and considerable reserves
buildup there was no reason for their introduction. They attributed the delays in foreign
exchange availability to the implementation of the Anti-Money Laundering Law in mid2006, which imposed additional reporting requirements on transactions above a certain limit.
They indicated that such delays would be eliminated by early 2007, when an automated

13

information exchange system is expected to be in place. The authorities reiterated their
commitment to unrestricted convertibility for current account transactions.
Box 2. Uzbekistan: Business and Trade Environment
Recent surveys point to mixed progress in the business and trade environment areas.
The EBRD Transition Report (2006)
characterizes Uzbekistan as a
slow reformer, lagging behind in banking
sector reforms, trade and foreign exchange
liberalization, and privatization (Figure 1).
The World Bank’s Doing Business 2007
survey ranks Uzbekistan 147 among 175
countries, with unfavorable scores in trading
across borders and getting credit (Table 1). In
trade, import contract implementation takes
the longest amount of time in Uzbekistan.

A joint EBRD-World Bank Business Environment and Enterprise Performance Survey
(2006) ranks Uzbekistan favorably compared to other CIS countries in most areas. In
addition, it indicates a declining number of firms reporting problems in doing business in
2005 compared to 2002. However, a relatively high and increasing percentage of firms report
problems regarding unofficial payments when dealing with taxes, business licensing, and
accessing public services.

21.
The authorities recognized the need to enhance the quality of official statistics.
Despite improvements in data availability, weaknesses in economic data significantly hamper
surveillance. Large differences among various inflation indicators (CPI, PPI, and GDP
deflator) hinder the evaluation of inflationary pressures in the economy. National income
accounts, which employ inadequate valuation methods, are inconsistent with the external
sector and public finance data. Large errors and omissions in the balance of payments and
fiscal accounts point to inadequate coverage and classification issues. To resolve data
deficiencies in various sectors, the authorities have requested Fund technical assistance,
preferably in the form of a resident advisor.
VI. STAFF APPRAISAL
22.
Macroeconomic performance has been generally strong over the past two years.
Real GDP growth was high, the external current account surplus was large, and official
reserves continued to rise. These developments have been supported by a favorable external
environment, cautious fiscal policy, and gradual progress in structural reforms. With the
tightening of monetary policy in 2006, inflation has recently started coming down, but
remains high.
23.
The main macroeconomic challenge in 2007 is to reduce inflation further. To this
end, the staff welcomes the authorities’ intention to further tighten monetary policy and
continue to maintain a cautious fiscal stance. Given the strength of the balance of payments,
the staff recommends a flexible exchange rate policy so as to help take some pressure off
indirect policy instruments in slowing money growth and curbing inflation, while creating
room for adequate credit expansion to the private sector. Allowing a nominal appreciation of
the exchange rate would also be compatible with indications that the sum is undervalued.
24.
The authorities’ fiscal stance is appropriate, given their intention to tighten
monetary policy and consider exchange rate flexibility to reduce inflation. Over the
medium term, adequate monetary tightening and lower inflation would provide more room to
finance social and infrastructure expenditures without compromising fiscal sustainability.
The staff commends the authorities for the impressive progress in tax and treasury reforms
and encourages them to shift toward more capital expenditure by moderating increases in
public sector salaries and pensions, introduce a multi-year budgetary framework, and
consolidate the FRD’s operations under treasury control.
25.
The authorities’ medium-term growth objectives are very ambitious. These
objectives and the underlying higher investments would materialize only if inflation is
contained, credit to the private sector picks up, confidence in the banking system is
enhanced, and the difficult business environment improves, including through substantial
trade liberalization. The favorable external environment provides an excellent opportunity to
accelerate reforms in these areas.

15

26.
Financial deepening is essential to strengthen the monetary transmission
mechanism and enhance the banks’ role in economic development. The staff supports the
authorities’ efforts to strengthen the banking sector. To enhance confidence in the banking
sector, the staff recommends that all remaining restrictions on cash withdrawals from banks
be completely removed; the role of banks in financial oversight and implementing non-core
activities be discontinued; and undue interference in the activities of the banking system be
eliminated. The staff also recommends that the authorities request an FSAP to help prioritize
banking sector reforms.
27.
Trade liberalization is needed to enhance the business climate and medium-term
growth prospects. A comprehensive move toward trade liberalization will improve
productivity and allow Uzbekistan to realize its external trade potential. To these ends, the
staff advises the authorities to lower and unify tariffs, eliminate differences in excise taxes on
imported and domestic goods, reduce costs related to international trade, streamline customs
procedures, and accelerate WTO accession. The staff also urges the authorities to fully
adhere to their obligations under Article VIII of the Fund’s Articles of Agreement and
welcomes the authorities’ reiteration of their full commitment to unrestricted currency
convertibility for current account transactions.
28.
There is an urgent need to enhance the quality of statistics. Weaknesses in
economic data hamper surveillance significantly. The staff welcomes and strongly supports
the authorities’ request for technical assistance to address data weaknesses in price indices,
national income accounts, and the balance of payments. The staff also urges the authorities to
participate in the GDDS and publish economic data.
29.
It is proposed that the next Article IV consultation with Uzbekistan takes place on the
standard 12-month cycle.

1/ Variables include real GDP growth, growth of GDP deflator (in U.S. dollar terms), non-interest current account in percent of GDP, and non-debt creating flows.
2/ Assumes that the interest rate on new borrowing is by 2 percentage points higher than in the baseline., while grace and maturity periods are the same as in the baselin
3/ Exports values are assumed to remain permanently at the lower level, but the current account as a share of GDP is assumed to return to its baseline level after
the shock (implicitly assuming an offsetting adjustment in import levels).
4/ Includes official and private transfers and FDI.
5/ Depreciation is defined as percentage decline in dollar/local currency rate, such that it never exceeds 100 percent.
6/ Applies to all stress scenarios except for A2 (less favorable financing) in which the terms on all new financing are as specified in footnote 2.

The exchange rate is determined in the interbank foreign exchange market. However, the
market has been characterized by one sided intervention by the Central Bank of Uzbekistan
leading to exchange rate stability against the U.S. dollar in the second half of 2006 within a
two percent band. Consequently, IMF staff has reclassified the de facto exchange rate regime
as a “conventional peg” from the previous classification of “managed floating with no predetermined path for the exchange rate”.

3
Uzbekistan accepted the obligations of Article VIII Sections 2(a), 3 and 4 of the Fund’s
Articles of Agreements with effect on October 15, 2003.

Safeguards Assessment:

The CBU is currently not subject to safeguards assessment policy since Uzbekistan is not
expected to have a financial arrangement with the Fund in the near future.
XIII. Technical Assistance:
Technical assistance and training have been provided by the Fund (MAE, FAD, STA, LEG,
and INS) to Uzbekistan in a number of areas. Technical assistance is now being provided on
budget and treasury reforms and has been requested by the authorities to address data
weaknesses in price indices, national income accounts, and balance of payments.
Monetary and exchange affairs:
April 2002 mission: External public debt management (with the participation of a
World Bank consultant; the mission was carried out in the framework of a joint IMF-

4
Swiss regional project for countries in the Swiss constituency, financed by the
Government of Switzerland).
In October 2003, a member of MFD participated in a staff visit to review the foreign
exchange system, and assist the government in identifying the foreign exchange
restrictions and multiple currency practices that needed to be abolished before the
authorities accept the obligations of Article VIII, sections 2, 3, and 4, of the IMF’s
Articles of Agreement.
Fiscal affairs:
October/November 2002 mission: Public expenditure management review.
September 2004 mission: Public expenditure management review.
Statistical issues:
March 2000 mission: Balance of payments statistics.
April 2000 mission: Money and banking statistics.
November 2003 mission: National accounts and price statistics.
August/September 2004 mission: National accounts statistics
Legal issues:
The Fund has provided advice and assistance to the Government and the
Central Bank of Uzbekistan on a range of legal issues, especially relating to foreign
exchange and banking legislation. In particular, in 2000 and in 2002, a member of
LEG conducted a review of the foreign exchange regulations. In October 2003,
another member of LEG participated in a staff visit to assist the government in
identifying the foreign exchange restrictions and multiple currency practices that
needed to be abolished before the authorities accept the obligations of Article VIII,
sections 2, 3, and 4, of the IMF’s Articles of Agreement.
Training:
Uzbek officials have participated in courses in Washington, at the IMF-Singapore
Training Institute, and at the Joint Vienna Institute in the areas of macroeconomic
management, financial programming, taxation, public expenditure and treasury
management, monetary statistics and policy, and balance of payments analysis.
Courses on selected topics were also organized in Tashkent in June 1993, May 1994,
and April/May 1998.

5
XIV. Resident Representative:
The Fund’s first Resident Representative, Istvan Szalkai, was in Tashkent from
September 1993 to September 1995. His successor, Mark O’Brien, served from
November 1995 to December 1997. He was replaced by Christoph Rosenberg who served
from January 1998 to April 2001. Currently, the Fund does not have a resident representative
in Uzbekistan, but maintains a locally staffed office in Tashkent.
XV.

Resident Advisors:

Richard Grzebinski served as an advisor on computerization to the State Tax Committee
from January 1994 to January 1995. His successor, Mr. Emmanuel Sigler, served from April
to June 1995.
Alexander Agafonoff served as an advisor on monetary policy at the Central Bank of
Uzbekistan from November 1994 to December 1995.
Jim Stevenson began his service as an advisor on treasury operations at the Ministry of
Finance in September 1996. His assignment was prematurely terminated in July 1998
because of a lack of cooperation by the ministry of finance.
John Zohrab began his service in January 2003 as an advisor to the ministry of finance. He
assisted the authorities with the Public Financial Management (PFM) project, including
treasury modernization, while visiting Tashkent from Georgia. In November 2006, he was
relocated to Tashkent to assist with (i) PFM project implementation, (ii) continuation of
treasury reform, and (iii) PFM legal framework strengthening.

6
APPENDIX II: RELATIONS WITH SELECTED INTERNATIONAL FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS
The World Bank
(As of January 18, 2007)
1.
Uzbekistan became a member of the IBRD and IDA in September 1992, of the IFC in
October 1993, and of the MIGA in November 1993. Prior to FY02, Uzbekistan was an
IBRD-only borrower. In December 2001, it became a blend country eligible for both IBRD
and IDA borrowing but the last lending operation to Uzbekistan, which was approved in
September 2004, was an IDA-only credit.
2.
As of December 31, 2006, there are two IBRD loans, two blend IBRD-IDA
operations and two IDA credits in the active portfolio, namely: Rural Water Supply and
Sanitation (US$75 million, approved August 1997); Rural Enterprise Support
(US$36.14 million, approved December 2001); Bukhara/Samarkand Water Supply
(US$20 million IBRD loan and SDR15.9 million IDA credit, approved March 2002);
Drainage, Irrigation and Wetland Management (US$35 million IBRD loan and
SDR18.4 million IDA credit, approved June 2003); Health II Credit (SDR26.9 million,
approved September 2004), and Basic Education (SDR 10.1 million). The undisbursed
balance of the ongoing projects as of end-December 2006 was US$142.8 million and the
IBRD and IDA debt outstanding and disbursed as of end-December 2006 was
US$316 million.
3.
The Bank’s non-lending activities in Uzbekistan in recent years have included a
country procurement assessment (FY02), a living standards/poverty assessment (FY03), a
country economic memorandum (FY03), an investment climate assessment (FY04), a public
expenditure review (FY04), a financial accountability assessment (FY04), and a number of
policy notes under a programmatic public expenditure review and a programmatic poverty
assessment (FY05 – 07). Presently the Bank is continuing economic and advisory work
within the framework of technical assistance to the preparation of the government’s Welfare
Improvement Strategy (PRSP). The areas covered by this technical assistance include
microfinancing, housing financing and efficiency of public utilities. The Bank is also
currently providing — or administering on behalf of other donors—several grants, including
grants for the development of capacity of public sector audit institutions and for wheat flour
fortification.
4.
The last Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) for Uzbekistan covering FY02–04
expired in July 2004. The World Bank prepared an interim strategy note for Uzbekistan for
FY07–08 centering on technical assistance, capacity building and advisory services which
was discussed by the Bank’s Executive Directors in July 2006. The interim strategy
maintains the World Bank’s focus on alleviating poverty in Uzbekistan by continuing to
engage the authorities on governance and economic recovery, and trying to reach out to civil
society.

7
5.
Since Uzbekistan became an IFC member in 1993, the IFC has committed nearly
US$68 million of its own funds and has arranged for over US$13 million in syndications.
The IFC has focused its activities on supporting SMEs, developing financial markets and
leasing and providing TA to improve the business environment. IFC has provided SME
credit lines to Asaka Bank, the National Bank of Uzbekistan (NBU), Hamkorbank, and
Parvina Bank. In addition, IFC recently approved a second SME credit Line to Hamkorbank
coupled with technical assistance to strengthen bank management and operations. IFC is also
considering the possibility of starting a new Microfinance Bank in Uzbekistan jointly with
EBRD, ADB, KfW and a private microfinance provider. IFC will continue to seek qualified
private intermediaries for investment under the IFC Central Asia Leasing Facility, such as
UzKDB (Uzbekistan Korea Development Bank) and other institutions for future SME credit
lines. IFC is also a significant shareholder in the Central Asia Small Enterprise Fund
(CASEF) that provides equity and quasi-equity to local enterprises—CASEF has made three
equity investments to date in Uzbekistan and a fourth has been approved and is currently
being finalized. Furthermore, the IFC has selectively invested in the real sector which
included projects in the pharmaceutical industry, furniture manufacturing, granite processing
and cheese production.
6.
On the technical assistance side, the IFC has been very active through the Private
Enterprise Partnership Central Asia on improving financial intermediation for micro and
small business enterprises as well as improvements to the business environment. For
example, in 2002 the IFC helped to develop new leasing legislation which improved
considerably financing options for SMEs, and in 2005 with IFC support, seven new
Presidential decrees were adopted to help improve the business-enabling environment for
SMEs. Ongoing TA projects include the SME survey and business environment reform
policy project and, the leasing and mortgage development work. The IFC will continue to
promote private sector development through dedicated technical assistance aiming to
improve the business environment and legislation, as well as continue to support financing to
SMEs and micro-enterprises. As of January 2007, the IFC portfolio stood at US$16 million,
with 88 percent in financial markets and 12 percent in the real sector. The portfolio is
predominantly composed of loans.
The European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD)
(As of December 31, 2006)
7.
Uzbekistan became a member of the EBRD in 1992. The current Country Strategy
covering the period 2005-2007 was approved in July 2005. The Strategy noted that although
some progress had been achieved on the economic side since 2003, the transition targets set
in the intermediary strategy had not been met, and as a result the Country strategy suspended
the public sector operations. It mentioned, however, that the Bank would stay engaged in
Uzbekistan and focus its activities on private sector investment and entrepreneurship.
8.
The EBRD’s cumulative commitments of EUR 547 million are concentrated in three
main areas: Financial institutions (26 percent), Natural resources and energy (35.5 percent),
and Infrastructure (27 percent). Most of the Bank’s funding is in the form of debt (98 percent

8
of the Bank’s portfolio in Uzbekistan) with only EUR 5.6 million in equity investment. The
current disbursement ratio is 85 percent of total commitments. Overall, EBRD’s portfolio is
performing well, with the exception of two private sector operations, one in textiles and one
in construction materials. With 56 percent of EBRD financing in the private sector, the
Bank’s operations in Uzbekistan are below the target ratio of 60 percent, reflecting the low
level of western FDI, a main source of business volume for the Bank, in the country. In terms
of business volume, the limitations of the Strategy and the difficulties in the investment
climate brought it down to around US$6 million in 2006, with a target of US$20–30 million
in 2007.
9.
A new Country Strategy for 2007–09 will be discussed with the Uzbek authorities in
mid-2007 and presented to the Board during the second half of the year.
The Asian Development Bank (ADB)
(As of December 31, 2006)
10.
Uzbekistan became a member of the ADB in 1995. A new Country Strategy and
Program (CSP) for Uzbekistan was endorsed by the ADB Board of Directors in March 2006.
The CSP covering 2006–10 aims to continue to support the country’s transition to a marketbased economy and its integration with the global economy. In line with the country’s own
strategic priorities, ADB plans to have its operations focus on four key areas: rural
development, promotion of private sector development, regional cooperation in transport and
customs transit, and improvement of social services with an emphasis on early childhood
development and basic education.
11.
The CSP envisages, that the ADB provides loans to Uzbekistan of about US$100
million a year over the next three years and about US$2 million a year for technical
assistance (TA) grant for support of capacity building and policy and institutional reforms.
The authorities and ADB agree to review the CSP from time to time, and update the ADB’s
operations programs, in line with the country’s changing needs and in consultation with
development of other development partners’ programs. For example, one of the recent
inclusions in the ADB’s 2007 program is a proposed public finance management reform
project to help establish a treasury system.
12.
The actual achievement of ADB’s operations in Uzbekistan will depend on the
progress in the country’s implementation capacity, and relevant policy and institutional
reforms in the areas of ADB operations.
13.
ADB’s operational approach has been a constructive engagement in Uzbekistan, with
its assistance tailored to the pace and direction of reforms undertaken by the government.
ADB's approach to investment lending has taken into account (i) impact on poverty
reduction, (ii) contribution to regional cooperation, (iii) contribution to formulation and
implementation of the government's reform strategies and policies, and (iv) implementation
progress of existing projects in the sector under consideration.

9
14.
As of 31 December 2006, cumulative lending to Uzbekistan totaled US$976.3 million
for 23 loans. Of these, 19 loans for US$872.3 million were provided from ADB’s ordinary
capital resources (OCR) and four for US$102.6 million from the concessional Asian
Development Fund (ADF). Of the loans approved, 17 are active, with five in agriculture and
natural resources (29 percent) and four in the education (30 percent) sectors accounting for
the largest share. The water supply, sanitation and waste management, and transport and
communication sectors account for 15 percent and 10 percent, respectively, while loans to
the health, nutrition and social protection, finance, industry and trade, and energy sectors
represent 16 percent of current portfolio. Since 1996, ADB has provided a total of 70 TA
grants to Uzbekistan totaling US$39.6 million as of 31 December 2006, out of which 6 TAs
for US$1.65 million were approved in 2006. In addition, there are 13 regional technical
assistance projects (RETA) that are currently active and involve Uzbekistan to various
extents.
15.
At the end of December 2006, the portfolio had 2 projects “at risk.” Overall, ADB
portfolio performance is rated satisfactory in terms of impact and outcome, and
implementation progress. Contract awards in 2006 totaled US$37 million. Disbursements
during the year totaled US$59.9 million.

APPENDIX III: STATISTICAL ISSUES
Despite improvements in data availability, weaknesses in economic data significantly hamper
surveillance. The authorities have yet to approve publication of a country page in
International Financial Statistics (IFS) and to participate in the General Data Dissemination
System (GDDS).
Real sector
1.
In the area of national accounts, the statistical authorities have made some progress in
developing statistics following international standards (the 1993 System of National
Accounts). This has been accomplished with technical assistance provided by the OECD and
the Fund and following the guidelines of the CIS statistical committee.
2.
At the request of the State Statistics Committee (SSC) of Uzbekistan, two real sector
missions visited Tashkent—in November 2003 and August 2004. The main objectives of the
missions were to assess the quality of the national accounts and to initiate a project to
develop quarterly gross domestic product (GDP) estimates. The main recommendations of
the missions concerned the gross output valuation. The missions recommended that it be
derived using actual transaction prices, rather than accounting prices (costs plus expected
profits). Another issue was the adoption by the SSC of international classifications, in which
progress has been slow. The other recommendations of the mission included: (i) using value
added rather than output as weights in the production indices, whenever possible;
(ii) improving the methods to compute the quarterly GDP estimates, and presenting quarterly
data as discrete values rather than cumulative through the year; (iii) improving the treatment
in the constant price estimates of new industries and products entering the economy, and
ensuring that the most detailed industrial breakdown is used in deriving the constant price
estimates; (iv) ensuring consistency between the product specification used in the industry
statistics and the PPI; (v) adopting appropriate techniques to adjust quarterly values to a
revised annual total; (vi) improving coverage of the informal sector; and (vii) developing
supply and use tables for years with comprehensive data. In addition, the authorities are not
reporting regularly the data on GDP by expenditure in constant prices. When available, these
data point to sectoral inconsistencies and need further improvement.
3.
The November 2003 STA mission found that developments in price statistics since
1998 had been satisfactory. However, it identified two main issues related to the incorrect
treatment of secondary products in the producer price index and the use of variable monthly
weights in the new CPI. Regarding the CPI, the mission pointed out that there is a break in
the new index between December 2002, which was constructed using the old methodology,
and January 2003, when the new methodology was introduced. During the discussions for the
2004 Article IV consultation, staff urged the SSC to consider this weakness and provide staff
with the detailed calculations of the new index for 2002-03. During the Article IV mission in
February 2005, and a follow-up visit by SSC staff to Washington, technical assistance was
provided to the staff of the SSC in applying international standards for treatment of the

11
seasonal goods in the CPI. The method used to treat seasonal goods was considered to
seriously understate overall inflation. A recommendation to change the methodology has not
been taken up by the SSC.
4.
Regarding data on external trade, exports of cotton and other bulk exports are valued
on a c.i.f. basis rather than f.o.b. Some adjustments are made to capture informal crossborder trade and shuttle trade. Also, two parallel systems now exist for compiling trade
data—one based on customs declarations and the other based on enterprise surveys. STA has
recommended that the customs data be used for compiling merchandise trade statistics and
the enterprise reports to collect data on trade in services only.
Government finance
5.
Detailed data on revenue and expenditure of the consolidated government budget are
compiled by the Ministry of Finance (MoF) on a monthly basis, and are available after a
processing time of about four weeks. Data for extra budgetary funds are available quarterly
with a longer delay, and include only broad categories of revenue and expenditure of the four
largest funds. After reviewing the government finance statistics (GFS) guidelines with the
staff, the authorities providing, occasionally, fiscal tables that conform to these guidelines, by
including net lending and foreign-financed investment, as well as details on the financing of
the deficit.
6.
Budget expenditure data are organized according to a largely functional
classification. An economic classification is available only annually, but the quality of these
data is inadequate. The MoF occasionally provides data on tax arrears. Information on total
proceeds from privatization operations and Treasury bills are provided on a quarterly basis,
and data on issuance and repayments of Treasury bills are available monthly on request.
7.
Following an exploratory FAD mission in October 2002, FAD sent a resident advisor
in February 2003 to assist the authorities in developing efficient expenditure management
procedures, including budget and treasury reforms. As part of this project, substantial
progress has been achieved in developing a new Chart of Accounts, conforming to GFS
guidelines, while the Treasury Law was revised and approved by Parliament in August 2004.
The authorities have published data on 2005 Budget execution as well as on the 2006 Budget
on the official website of the MoF.
8.

Uzbekistan does not report GFS to STA.

Money and banking
9.
Following the introduction of new charts of accounts for the Central Bank of
Uzbekistan (CBU) and for the commercial banks in 1997, a number of monetary and
financial statistics missions have assisted the CBU in compiling monetary statistics using
data from the new charts of accounts and in accordance with the IMF recommended
methodology. With the implementation of major recommendations of these missions,

12
considerable progress was made in resolving issues linked to the preparation of monetary and
financial statistics for eventual inclusion in a proposed Uzbekistan page in IFS.
Balance of payments and external debt
10.
Uzbekistan does not report any balance of payments data to STA and does not
disseminate balance of payments data to the public. An STA mission in March 2000, (a
follow-up to the February 1998 mission), reported that the authorities had made considerable
progress in the compilation of balance of payments statistics. Progress was noted in the
compilation of data on the financial account and external debt. Specific improvements were
made in accordance with the recommendations of the February 1998 mission, which include
the preparation of quarterly balance of payments data in U.S. dollars, classification closely in
line with the recommendations of the IMF Balance of Payments Manual (BPM5), shuttle
trade statistics in the recorded international trade data, estimates for migrant transfers, and
other adjustments to the exports and imports data. Despite these improvements, problems
remained with respect to the large errors and omissions item, reporting of travel data and
construction services, and the availability of enterprise-based data on direct, portfolio, and
other investment.
11.
Data provision on external debt has improved considerably since 2003 and is broadly
satisfactory. Data on external government and government-guaranteed debt, including
projections of future debt service obligations, are provided by the Ministry of Finance. They
are provided in U.S. dollars and also decomposed by currency. Loan-by-loan data are
provided in the currency of denomination. The data are submitted on a quarterly frequency,
though often with some delay. Aggregate data are broken down into government and
government-guaranteed debt and then further classified by type of lender (multilateral,
bilateral, and commercial). However, the authorities do not indicate separately the amount of
debt extended on concessional terms, or the amount of private debt owed or intermediated by
banks. The data include projections of future debt service obligations under existing
agreements.
12.
Data on external private debt not guaranteed by the government, including
projections of future debt service obligations and new loan agreements, are provided by the
central bank. Aggregate data are submitted on a quarterly basis. Debt projections should,
however, distinguish between the debt service obligations due under existing agreements and
those arising from newly-contracted debt.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

International Monetary Fund
700 19th Street, NW
Washington, D. C. 20431 USA

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2006 Article IV Consultation with the
Republic of Uzbekistan
On February 9, 2007, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded
the Article IV consultation with the Republic of Uzbekistan.1
Background
Uzbekistan’s macroeconomic performance was generally strong in 2005–06, reflecting
significant macroeconomic policy adjustment and a favorable external environment. According
to official data, real GDP growth was over 7 percent, driven by agriculture, industry, and
transport and communications, and supported by buoyant external demand. The external
current account registered large surpluses due to favorable commodity prices, strong growth in
non-commodity exports, increased remittances, and restricted imports. Official foreign
exchange reserves continued to rise and reached 12 months of import cover at end-2006.
Inflation, as measured by various price indices, picked up in 2005. With a tightening of
monetary policy, it started coming down in 2006, but remains high.
After a gradual depreciation in 2005 and early 2006, the sum was de facto pegged to the U.S.
dollar during the second half of 2006. The real effective exchange rate appreciated in the past
two years due to higher inflation.
Monetary policy was accommodative in 2005, but was tightened in 2006. In 2005, the sharp
accumulation of net foreign assets by the Central Bank of Uzbekistan (CBU) was only partially
sterilized by a decline in net domestic assets, resulting in surging reserve and broad money. In
2006, to offset the large build up of reserves, the authorities tightened monetary policy
1

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On
return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the
Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the
Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the
country's authorities.

2

significantly via increased deposits from banks, the accumulation of government deposits,
including through the newly created Fund for Reconstruction and Development (FRD), and the
resumption of the issuance of central bank paper. As a result, growth of monetary aggregates
decelerated considerably by end-2006, with growth in reserve money declining from 88
percent in 2005 to 37 percent in 2006.
The banking sector is undergoing structural changes, with the expansion of business areas
and the move to local currency lending. Furthermore, prudential ratios exceed minimum
standards and non-performing loans are declining. However, monetization is low, growth of
cash-in-circulation is faster than that of deposits, and the ratio of credit-to-GDP continues to
decline. The banking system's ability to fulfill its intermediary role has been constrained by the
limited room for credit expansion given the strong growth in net foreign assets and the need to
control the growth of reserve money as well as banks' involvement in financial oversight and
implementing government treasury operations, which affects confidence in the banking sector.
Fiscal policy outperformed budget projections in 2005–06. Despite tax cuts, revenue collection
was strong due to ongoing tax reforms. On the expenditure side, large increases in public
sector wages and pensions were mainly offset by lower capital expenditures. As a result, the
consolidated budget registered a surplus of 1.3 percent of GDP in 2005 and is estimated to
have registered a small surplus in 2006, compared to the budgeted deficits of about 3 percent
of GDP in both years. The overall fiscal surplus, including the FRD, is estimated at about 3½
percent of GDP in 2006.
Structural reforms continued at a gradual pace. Tax reforms to ease the tax burden led to
improved collections, while treasury reforms were effective in enhancing fiscal management.
Licensing, inspections, and reporting were streamlined, and the restructuring of agricultural
enterprises (shirkats) into private farms was mostly completed. Furthermore, restrictions on
banks’ access to their correspondent accounts at the CBU and cash withdrawals from bank
deposits were eased, and a real time gross settlement system was introduced. However,
privatization stalled, a difficult investment climate resulted in low FDI inflows, and the trade
regime remains protective and complex. Despite improvements in data availability,
weaknesses in economic data remain.
Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors commended the Uzbek authorities on the strong performance of the
economy, which has been supported by a favorable external environment, improvements in
macroeconomic policies, and gradual progress in structural reforms.
Directors were of the view that economic prospects are strong in the near term, but
emphasized that containing inflation, enhancing financial intermediation and confidence in the
banking system, and improving the business climate including through the liberalization of
trade and payments would be crucial to achieve the authorities’ ambitious growth objectives in
the medium term.
Directors considered that the main challenge in 2007 is to reduce inflation and supported the
authorities’ intention to further tighten monetary policy. They recommended a more flexible
exchange rate policy to take some pressure off indirect monetary policy instruments in curbing

3

inflation and creating room for greater credit expansion to the private sector. Allowing some
nominal appreciation would be compatible with indications that the sum is undervalued.
Directors recommended continuation of cautious fiscal policies in 2007 to help reduce inflation.
They also noted that—given the low level of debt—lower inflation would provide room in the
medium term for moderate fiscal loosening and small deficits to finance higher social and
infrastructure expenditure. Directors expressed concern that the recent increases in public
sector salaries and pensions have limited resources for investment spending, and considered
that the income objectives could be better served by well-targeted subsidies to the poor.
Directors encouraged the authorities to make further progress in tax and treasury reforms,
introduce a multi-year budget framework, and integrate the FRD into the government budget.
Directors stressed the crucial importance of financial deepening to enhance the role of banks
in economic development and strengthen the monetary transmission mechanism. To enhance
confidence in the banking system and encourage deposits, all remaining restrictions on cash
withdrawals should be removed and the role of banks in financial oversight and government
treasury functions should be discontinued. A Financial Sector Assessment Program would help
prioritize banking sector reforms.
Directors noted that the trade system continues to be protective in Uzbekistan. The authorities
should reduce and unify tariffs, eliminate differences in excise taxes on imported and domestic
goods, reduce administrative costs related to international trade, streamline customs
procedures, and accelerate efforts to join the World Trade Organization.
Directors welcomed the authorities’ reiteration of their commitment to current account
convertibility amid reports of delays in convertibility in 2006. They hoped that the transitory
convertibility problems associated with the implementation of the anti-money laundering law
would be resolved in early 2007.
Directors regretted that weaknesses in economic data continue to hamper surveillance. They
welcomed the authorities’ intention to enhance the quality of statistics, and their request for
technical assistance in national accounts, price, and balance of payments statistics. Directors
urged the authorities to participate in the General Data Dissemination Standards and publish
economic data, including in the IFS.
Public Information Notices (PINs) form part of the IMF's efforts to promote transparency of the IMF's
views and analysis of economic developments and policies. With the consent of the country (or countries)
concerned, PINs are issued after Executive Board discussions of Article IV consultations with member
countries, of its surveillance of developments at the regional level, of post-program monitoring, and of ex
post assessments of member countries with longer-term program engagements. PINs are also issued after
Executive Board discussions of general policy matters, unless otherwise decided by the Executive Board in
a particular case.

Statement by Thomas Moser, Executive Director for Republic of Uzbekistan
February 12, 2007
1.
My authorities wish to express their appreciation to the mission team for their
extremely constructive approach and the productive policy dialogue. They are fully aware
and concur with the staff’s assessment that Uzbekistan’s great economic potential remains to
be fully exploited. They are committed to a continued implementation of their gradual reform
agenda. They will give careful consideration to the staff’s policy advice, and they consent to
the publication of the staff report. They highly value, and put to good use, the technical
assistance that is currently provided on budget and treasury reforms, and they hope that the
Fund will grant their request for assistance to comprehensively address data issues in price
indices, national income accounts, and balance of payments.
2.
Since the liberalization of the foreign exchange system, which was undertaken in late
2003 upon advice and with assistance of the IMF, Uzbekistan’s macroeconomic
performance has been very strong. Supported by prudent macroeconomic policies and
gradual progress in structural reforms, annual real GDP growth accelerated to over 7 percent,
well above Fund projections, whereby the contribution of capital intensive sectors has been
increasing over time. The rapid growth in non-commodity exports, which now account for
more than half of Uzbekistan’s total exports, also contributed to high GDP growth and
strengthened its sustainability. In combination with the authorities’ prudent fiscal and
external borrowing policy, this good performance led to a continuous decline in Uzbekistan’s
external debt to the very comfortable level of 24.5 percent of GDP, which will allow
Uzbekistan to maintain its very good credit history.
3.
My authorities share the staff’s view that economic growth and the balance of
payments are likely to remain strong. Building on strong macroeconomic fundamentals and
continuous structural reforms to be outlined in the authorities’ Welfare Improvement
Strategy (WISP, the equivalent of a PRSP), the authorities attempt to accelerate annual real
GDP growth to 8 percent. They are convinced that the policy of gradual reforms has served
Uzbekistan well, making it the first country within the CIS to restore positive economic
growth and return to the pre-reform level of output, despite one of the most difficult starting
positions. The authorities believe that the state’s active role in maintaining stability over the
period when key market institutions were just emerging was an important element in this
strategy.
Fiscal Policy
4.
In 2006, the consolidated budget registered a small surplus, with an overall fiscal
surplus of about 3 percent of GDP. The authorities intend to continue their cautious fiscal and
borrowing policy in 2007.

2
5.
The authorities have an ambitious reform agenda in the fiscal area. The new Tax
Code, which has been submitted to parliament, envisages a further reduction of the tax
burden, broadening of the tax base, and streamlining of tax administration. The authorities
expect the new Tax Code to contribute to a significant improvement in the business climate,
based on their experience with the tax rate reductions in 2005 and 2006, which resulted in an
increase in tax revenues.
6.
An important part of the authorities’ fiscal reforms is the Public Finance Management
project, which is well advanced and will bring significant improvements in terms of
efficiency and transparency. The project aims at establishing a Treasury Single Account for
the general government sector, including local government budgets and extra-budgetary
funds, at establishing a modern Treasury Information System, and at bringing budget
classification and accounting in line with international standards (GFS 2001 and IPSAS).
Moreover, preparations have been made for introducing a Medium Term Budget Framework.
The completion of these reforms will enable the authorities to relieve the banking sector from
the remaining non-core functions (i.e., financial oversight and treasury operations).
Monetary Policy
7.
The Central Bank of Uzbekistan (CBU) is fully aware of the need to keep inflation
under control and it is committed to do so. In response to increasing inflationary pressures,
the CBU tightened monetary policy considerably during the course of 2006, and it intends to
tighten monetary policy further in 2007 to achieve the desired reduction in inflation. The
newly established Fund for Reconstruction and Development (FRD) will support the CBU’s
efforts to sterilize excess money supply. The FRD will finance investment projects only
through commercial banks and only for imports of investment goods. Exchange rate policy
will continue to aim at limiting real appreciation, but the authorities are prepared to consider
a more flexible exchange rate policy, if warranted by economic developments.
8.
The Uzbek authorities remain fully committed to currency convertibility for current
account transactions, in line with their obligations under Article VIII of the Fund’s Articles
of Agreement. The comfortable level of official reserves, the considerable increase of the
current account surplus, and the tight monetary and fiscal policies obviate the need for any
administrative measures on the foreign exchange market. My authorities are aware, however,
that some sporadic irregularities in conversion transactions have been reported by market
participants. But they would like to highlight that these problems were caused by transitory
problems related to the introduction of new anti-money laundering legislation.
Structural Reforms
9.
Since the last Article IV consultation, progress in structural reforms and
improvements in the environment for the private sector have also continued in other areas
than the tax and treasury reforms mentioned above. As noted in the staff report, the

3
restructuring of agricultural enterprises (shirkats) into private farms has been mostly
completed. A number of new legislative acts and amendments have been adopted by the
Parliament, including laws on mortgage, electronic payments, microfinancing, and collateral.
10.
The government has further issued a range of orders aimed at introducing “one-stop”
registration procedures based on notification only, drastically reducing licensing
requirements, streamlining licensing procedures and eliminating overlap between different
agencies and local governments, simplifying and reducing the frequency of reporting
requirements for enterprises, and at limiting interferences of regulatory agencies. It has also
limited the scope and frequency of inspections by regulatory agencies and local authorities
and made most sanctions subject to court decisions. These measures have helped to
encourage growth of the SME sector, which in 2006 alone has created 440,000 new jobs and
accounts now for about 42 percent of GDP.
11.
My authorities recognize the value of the IFC’s “Doing Business” report in
supporting member-countries’ reform efforts. However, they would like to point out that this
study does not represent a comprehensive assessment of the business or investment climate,
but rather assesses specific aspects of the regulatory environment. Moreover, given the
shortcomings common for most aggregated indicators and controversies related to the
studies’ overall indicator for a range of countries, our authorities believe that the overall
rating produced by “Doing Business” should be treated with caution. In this regard, they
appreciate the reference in the staff report to the joint World Bank/EBRD survey of
enterprises, which ranks favorably Uzbekistan’s business climate on most of the indicators
relative to average indicators in the Europe and Central Asia region. Most important, the last
survey clearly demonstrates that Uzbekistan has been advancing in all areas covered by the
study.
12.
The government recently adopted a comprehensive privatization program for 2006-08
that envisages privatization of more than 1500 enterprises, including enterprises in strategic
sectors (energy, chemical and transport). Based on this program the authorities privatized in
2006 about 600 enterprises, which led to privatization revenues that were 20 percent higher
