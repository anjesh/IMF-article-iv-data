Staff Report for the 2005 Article IV Consultation
Prepared by the Staff Representative for the 2005 Consultation with Argentina
(in consultation with other Departments)
Approved by John Dodsworth and G. Russell Kincaid
May 31, 2005
Consultation process
• The last Article IV consultation was concluded on January 8, 2003. During the Board discussion,
Directors emphasized the importance of (i) establishing a robust fiscal framework; (ii) implementing a bank
restructuring strategy; (iii) completing a comprehensive debt restructuring; and (iv) restoring legal certainty to
catalyze new credit flows, investment and growth. Directors have returned to these issues consistently—in the
course of the 14 Board meetings and 11 informal Board briefings that were held since then.
• Main issues for the 2005 consultation. The discussions focused on identifying factors underlying the
recovery and the near-term financing and inflation risks, assessing the main vulnerabilities going forward, and
identifying structural reform priorities that would be required to transform the recovery into sustainable growth
and poverty reduction in the medium term. In addition, there was a broad discussion of debt sustainability and
the experience of the recent debt restructuring process.
• Staff discussions. The staff team met with the authorities in Washington from March 14–18, April 16–18,
and May 10–12 and held several videoconferences between Washington and Buenos Aires. The ground work
for the discussions was laid in Buenos Aires by the resident representative office. The authorities included
Minister of Economy Lavagna, Secretary Nielsen, BCRA President Redrado and other officials. The staff team
comprised, at various times, J. Dodsworth (head and senior resident representative), R. Benelli, A. Cebotari,
N. Chalk, L. Giorgianni, and R. Luzio (all WHD), D. Lombardo (FAD), W. Brown (PDR), C. H. Lim and
M. Vera Martin (ICM) and E. Ramirez Rigo (resident representative). Mr. Singh (WHD) attended many of the
meetings. An MFD technical assistance team comprising C. Pazarbasioglu (head), A. Santos, and J. Cayazzo
also met with the authorities. H. Torres (OED) attended the policy meetings.
Fund support
• The current three-year Stand-By Arrangement (SBA) was approved on September 20, 2003 with access of
SDR 8,981 million (424 percent of quota). Three purchases have been made totaling SDR 4,171 million. On
May 18, 2005, repurchase expectations of SDR 1.68 billion arising during May 20, 2005 to April 28, 2006 were
extended by one year to an obligations basis.
Exchange system
• Argentina has accepted the obligations of Article VIII, sections 2, 3, and 4 of the Fund’s Articles of
Agreement. Argentina maintains an exchange restriction subject to approval under Article VIII, section 2(a)
arising from a freeze on reprogrammed bank deposits (the corralón). The Executive Board temporarily
approved this restriction until the 2005 Article IV consultation. Staff recommends continued approval of this
exchange restriction until September 30, 2005.

I. BACKGROUND
1.
Since the last Article IV consultation in January 2003, Argentina has recovered
strongly from the financial crisis that erupted in late 2001 (Figure 1). The crisis imposed
severe economic and social costs but, after 2½ years of vigorous growth, real output has
reached the peak level achieved prior to the crisis, labor market conditions are improving,
financial markets are stable, inroads have been made in reducing poverty, and the authorities
have made important progress toward normalizing relations with creditors.
2.
The 2005 Article IV consultation focuses on Argentina’s emergence from crisis
and the policy choices to complete this
process. Against the background of
Argentina's average real per capita GDP growth has

centered on identifying factors underlying the

Months since the onset of the crisis
restrictions were progressively

aspect of the recovery. In contrast to some other countries emerging from crisis, inflation—
after spiking in 2002—remained very moderate (reaching only 3¾ percent in 2003 and

-5-

6 percent in 2004) despite the almost 300 percent depreciation of the currency. In part, this
was a result of a freeze on public service prices. Given the softness of labor markets, real
wages recovered only slowly and, unlike several other crisis countries, the real exchange rate
remained at a highly depreciated level (Text Figure).

Box 1. Cross-Country Comparison of Recoveries from
Capital Account Crises1
The impact of the financial crisis on Argentina’s economy shares similarities with that of other countries
that faced large capital account crises in the last decade, although the adjustment path has been different
in a few aspects (see Box 1 Figure below):
•

Large exchange rate depreciations, both in nominal and real effective terms. While in most countries
the real effective exchange rate recovered gradually the real depreciation in Argentina has proved more
persistent. By end-2004, Argentina’s real effective exchange rate was still over 50 percent below its
pre-crisis average.

•

Sharp drop in real GDP after the currency crisis, followed by a strong rebound in activity. While
the drop in real GDP in Argentina was similar to that in Korea, Thailand and Turkey, its recovery was
somewhat slower than in these countries (except Thailand).

•

Sizeable current account corrections. Following the depreciations and the declines in economic
activity, imports contracted strongly. In most countries there was also a strong export response, which
contributed to large current account reversals and drove the initial stages of the recovery. In Argentina,
by contrast, export volume growth has been sluggish, despite the relatively large real exchange rate
depreciation, the favorable terms of trade and the strong growth experienced by its trading partners.
This reflects Argentina’s lower degree of openness and concentration on commodity and agricultural
exports, but also the distortions created by the export taxes.

•

Large fiscal consolidations. In all the countries considered—except Korea and Thailand, where the
headline debt-to-GDP ratios were very low prior to the crisis—fiscal policy had to be tightened
considerably in the aftermath of the crisis either to correct pre-existing imbalances or to bring down
debt ratios following their dramatic increases on the back of large exchange rate depreciations.

•

Banking crises accompanied the currency crises (except in Brazil), as banks carried unhedged
foreign exchange exposures to the government or nontradable sectors with local currency earnings.

•

Inflation. Unlike in some other countries emerging from crisis, inflation remained moderate in
Argentina after spiking in 2002, despite the almost 300 percent nominal depreciation of the currency.

Argentina’s recovery, in contrast to some other countries, has benefited from strong terms of trade.
While the large improvement in the terms of trade in the aftermath of the crisis has helped Argentina to sustain
its recovery and strengthen its fiscal position and external balance, other countries’ recoveries took place against
weakening terms of trade, with Russia and—to a lesser extent—Uruguay being notable exceptions. The reliance
of the recovery on favorable terms of trade underscores the need for Argentina to advance structural reforms
which would provide a firmer foundation for continued macroeconomic stability and robust growth and boost
external competitiveness, especially in a less supportive external environment.

The comparisons are made by focusing on the behavior of selected economic variables around the time of the crises in
Argentina, Brazil, Korea, Russia, Thailand, Turkey, and Uruguay. In the figures, time is rescaled by defining year T as the
year when the crisis erupted, year T+1 as the first post-crisis year, and so on. The crisis years are 1997 for Korea and
Thailand, 1998 for Russia, 1999 for Brazil, 2000 for Turkey, and 2001 for Argentina and Uruguay.

4.
The recovery was supported by a combination of political stability, prudent
macroeconomic policies, and favorable external conditions. The smooth political
transition following the May 2003 presidential elections was critical. President Kirchner,
while only receiving 22 percent of the national vote in the first round of the elections, quickly
gathered exceptionally high approval ratings and popularity. In his public statements, he gave
prominence to the mistakes of the 1990’s, to human rights issues, to denouncing corruption
and vested interests, and to the government’s support for labor groups, pensioners, and the
unemployed. At the same time, the firm implementation of fiscal and monetary policies was
key to rebuilding consumer and business confidence. These helped stabilize financial markets
and allowed a steady reduction of interest rates. Domestic confidence was further bolstered
by the unwinding of restrictions on bank deposits, the lifting of exchange controls, and the
redemption of federal and provincial quasi-monies. Argentina also benefited from a
supportive external environment, including an improvement in the terms of trade (by
10 percent during 2002–04) largely reflecting higher prices for key export commodities,
robust economic activity in Argentina’s main trading partners (especially Brazil), and low
world interest rates. The nominal bilateral exchange rate against the dollar has remained
within a 7 percent range since the first quarter of 2003.
5.
Social indicators began to improve from end-2002 at a steady, but gradual pace
(Box 2). The headline unemployment rate fell to about 13 percent in March 2005 from
17.8 percent in December 2002, though an additional 4.1 percent of the labor force was
employed under emergency social assistance programs. The share of the population living in
extreme poverty fell to 17 percent in June 2004 (from 24.8 percent two years earlier), while
the share of the population below the poverty line declined from a peak of 58 percent to
44 percent in June 2004.

agreed on the objective of maintaining
their exposure. However, since the failure to complete the third review of the three-year
Stand-By Arrangement, the authorities have been making sizeable net debt service payments
to the Fund. Since 2003, Argentina has made net principal payments to the Fund of SDR 2.4
billion (about US$3.7 billion) and paid charges of SDR 0.9 billion (about US$1.3 billion). In
the same period, net debt service to the World Bank and IDB has amounted to US$3.1
billion. In regard to other debt obligations, significant breathing room was provided by the

-9-

long interruption in payments on private and official bilateral creditors that resulted in an
accumulation of arrears of about US$40–45 billion during 2002–04.
Box 2. Impact of the Crisis on Social Indicators1
Argentina’s social indicators were already
deteriorating for some time prior to the financial
crisis. Unemployment rose from 6.3 percent in 1992
to 18.3 percent in 2001, partly as a result of a
structural increase in female labor market
participation. At the same time, the percentage of the
population below the official poverty line almost
doubled (from 19.9 to 38.8 percent) and income
inequality increased.

The 2001-02 crisis exacerbated the social
situation. Poverty peaked at 58 percent of the

The recent economic recovery has brought some alleviation, but it will take considerable time before the
social dislocations can be fully reversed. While unemployment has fallen by 6.2 points from its peak—and is
now at 1998 levels— poverty still remains well above pre-crisis levels.
The government has responded to the crisis by expanding its social safety net, including through the
introduction of the Unemployed Heads of Household program (PJD). The PJD provides a monthly transfer
of Arg$150 to unemployed heads of household with children under 18 years, in exchange for their participation
in training or community development activities. The program has had a cost of ¾ to 1 percent of GDP per year
over the last 3 years and serves some 1.6 million beneficiaries (around 20 percent below the peak in May 2003).
The latest World Bank assessment is broadly supportive of the PJD but suggests a progressive
transformation of the program. Monitoring and internal controls have been strengthened and the program
seems to be reasonably well targeted—75 percent of beneficiaries are below the 40th income percentile—
although there is room for improvement (8 percent of program recipients are in the richest 40 percent of the
population). The government is now working with the World Bank and IDB on a gradual exit strategy from the
PJD which would transfer some beneficiaries to other social programs and would also expand training and job
search support to allow the remaining program participants to transition to the labor market.

III. RECENT POLITICAL AND ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS
A. Political Developments
7.
Two years after his election, President Kirchner’s popularity ratings remain
high. The ratings have benefited from a generally tough line taken with foreign investors and
multilateral institutions on a number of policy issues including the debt exchange, the
renegotiation of utility concessions, and bank compensation. After initial attempts to build

- 10 -

his own political base by reaching out to the
left-of-center wing of Congress, President
Kirchner has more recently focused on
broadening his power base within the
traditional Peronist party through alliances
with provincial governors. The coming period
is likely to be devoted to galvanizing support
for candidates in the congressional elections to
be held in October 2005. A clear victory for
his own candidates would help secure
President Kirchner the Peronist party’s
presidential nomination for 2007.

Economic conditions have remained generally favorable during the first part of
2005. Growth has continued to be strong in the first quarter (estimated at about 9 percent
year-on-year) and consumer and business confidence indicators remain at very high levels.
Inflation, however, has accelerated amid rising demand, tighter capacity constraints, growing
wage pressures and monetary accommodation; consumer prices rose by 4.5 percent during
the first four months of 2005, bringing the annual inflation rate to 8.8 percent in April.
9.
A strong trade balance and a significant reduction in private capital outflows
have facilitated a sharp rise in international reserves (Table 3 and Box 3). The trade
surplus has been declining, but is still

The correction that occurred after the floating of the currency in early 2002 has placed the Argentine
peso in a range that is broadly consistent with other currencies in the region (Figure 1). Over the last few
decades, Argentina’s real effective exchange rate has been extremely volatile, which makes precise estimation
of the equilibrium real exchange rate difficult. However, the correction in the Argentine Peso – which is
currently at 50 percent of its peak prior to the devaluation of the Brazilian Real - has been larger than that of
both the Real and Uruguayan Peso, which are at 60 and 70 percent of their pre-crisis peaks respectively.
Moreover, since early 2004 the BCRA has actively
intervened to maintain a stable nominal exchange

The response of total exports to the large
currency depreciation has nonetheless been
moderate, but this is due to a number of factors
which have constrained the supply side. Poor
harvests contributed to negative volume growth on
average for 2002–04 for primary products (Table 1).
Export taxes discouraged investment and increases
in production. The banking sector crisis may have
also constrained financing for investment,
particularly for smaller producers dependent on
domestic finance. Finally, government actions to
secure domestic energy supplies have contributed to
negative volume growth for energy exports, despite
increases in international prices over this period.

exports has averaged 14.5 percent each quarter from 2003Q2 to end-2004, and preliminary data for 2005 show this
trend is continuing. Available data on market shares of
Argentine exports show a more mixed picture, although
these data do not yet include information for 2004
(Figure 2). The large increases of market shares in Asia
and Chile were largely due to a new pipelines for
hydrocarbon products (Chile) and increased agricultural
exports (Asia), and do not necessarily reflect improved
competitiveness.

In conclusion, while the current exchange rate level appears competitive, long-term export growth will
require steps to remove supply side constraints. Because total exports are still relatively small (23 percent of
GDP), a sustained and stable contribution of net exports to real GDP growth will depend on continued high
volume growth rates. These, in turn, will require further measures, including the phasing out of export taxes, to
entrench a supportive climate for exports and investment in the export sector.

C. Fiscal Policy Developments
10.
Fiscal policy is targeted to become more expansionary in 2005 (Tables 6–9). The
good performance in 2004 (when a record 5.1 percent of GDP consolidated primary surplus
was achieved) mainly reflected buoyant revenues—that rose to 29 percent of GDP, from
26 percent in 2003. Tax administration has been strengthened, and VAT and income taxes
have performed well. However, there continues to be a high reliance on distortive taxes
(export and financial transactions taxes) which account for some 4 percent of GDP of
revenues. The primary surplus would have been higher in 2004 but for an acceleration in
social and capital spending toward the end of the year that resulted in end-year expenditures
exceeding original budget targets by considerable margins. The approved budget for 2005
aims for a consolidated primary surplus of 3.8 percent of GDP on a cash basis. As in the
previous year, however, the outcome may be significantly higher; during the first quarter of
2005, the federal primary surplus was 0.8 percent of annual GDP and in line with the 2004
outcome, representing an overperformance of 0.2 percent of GDP compared with the
authorities’ own program.

(albeit from a low base) and interest rates remained low. Private sector deposits have grown,
though at a slower pace than government deposits held at the public banks.
E. Sovereign Debt Restructuring
13.
Argentina’s global debt exchange offer was launched in January 2005 (Box 4).
The offer sought to exchange US$82 billion of eligible claims for three types of bonds (par,
quasi-par and discount) and a detachable GDP-linked warrant.1 The decline in emerging
market spreads in the last part of 2004 increased the valuation of the offer to 32 cents per
US$ of principal claims, implying a NPV haircut of around 75 percent of total claims,
including past due interest. The authorities indicated that this would be a final offer and, on
February 9, Congress passed legislation prohibiting the executive branch from reopening the
current debt offer or reaching private settlements with nonparticipating creditors. The
exchange offer period closed on February 25, and, the authorities announced a 76 percent
participation level. On this basis, approximately US$20 billion in principal in default remains
outstanding, in addition to an estimated US$6–7 billion in interest arrears as of May 2005.
The settlement of the debt exchange, which was delayed because of attempts by some
nonparticipating creditors to attach the tendered bonds through court action, is now moving
ahead.2
F. Progress in Structural Reforms
14.
There has been little progress on structural reforms committed to under the
SBA supported program (Box 5). In the area of fiscal structural reforms, a fiscal
responsibility law was approved in August 2004,3 and some progress has been made in tax
administration reforms. In the banking area, compensation payments are being gradually
effected, and the due diligence and strategic review of Banco Provincia has been completed.
In the area of utilities, a regulatory framework draft law submitted to congress has important
shortcomings,4 the wholesale gas and electricity prices have only been partially adjusted, and
there continue to be difficulties in reaching long-term agreements with concessionaires,
particularly in the electricity, gas, and water sectors.5 Finally, an arbitration tribunal

The offer excluded past-due interest accrued after the date of the default; staff estimates that inclusion of this
would increase total claims to US$106-107 billion as of end-2004.

Staff believe that the law itself has several weaknesses. See Section VI, A, below, and Chapter II in the
selected issues paper.

The World Bank and other interested parties have commented on the draft law and find that it would not be
consistent with high private sector participation in these sectors. See Chapter III in the selected issues paper.

constituted under the rules of the International Center for the Settlement of Investment
Disputes (ICSID) awarded damages in mid-May amounting to US$133 million, plus interest,
in favor of a shareholder in an Argentine privatized gas transportation company. The
Tribunal found that through the pesoization and freeze on gas tariffs, Argentina had violated
the protections accorded to the investor under the U.S./Argentina bilateral investment treaty.6

Box 4. The Argentine Debt Exchange
After three years in default, the authorities launched their global debt exchange offer on
January 14, 2005 with roadshows in the United States, Europe, and Japan. The offer proposed the
exchange of US$82 billion of eligible claims (excluding past due interest accrued after end-2001) in 152
different securities for three new types of bonds (par, quasi-par, and discount instruments), each security with a
detachable GDP-linked warrant. At the time of exchange, the offer was valued at 32 cents per US$ of principal
claims, implying an NPV reduction (including past due interest) of around 75 percent (using a discount rate of
10 percent). Prior to the exchange’s conclusion, congress passed a law prohibiting the executive branch from
reopening the debt offer or from reaching private settlements with nonparticipating creditors.
The exchange closed on February 25 with a participation rate of 76.15 percent. The authorities announced
that US$24 billion were tendered within Argentina and US$38 billion from abroad. Despite this participation
rate, residual principal in default of US$20 billion and estimated past due interest of US$6–7 billion as of May
2005 –believed to be held mostly by nonresidents–remain unresolved.
The debt restructuring improves Argentina’s debt structure, and provides considerable debt relief. As a
result of the exchange, the authorities announced that the stock of federal government debt declined from
148 percent of GDP in December 2002 to 72 percent in April 2005, although this figure does not take account
of the debt in default which amounts to around 15 percent of GDP (including past due interest). Furthermore,
the cash flow of the new bonds is greatly back loaded, thus, improving the debt service profile. The exchange
leaves 37 percent of the federal government debt stock (excluding unrestructured debt in default) denominated
in pesos, a sizable increase from just 3 percent before the restructuring.
Settlement of the exchange, originally to begin on April 1, was delayed because some nonparticipating
creditors sought to attach the bonds that were tendered in the exchange. Although the court upheld
Argentina’s arguments that the tendered bonds were still the property of the bondholders and lifted the
attachment orders, the judge stayed his decision, leaving these bonds frozen pending determination of the
plaintiff’s appeal. The Court of Appeals ruled in favor of Argentina on May 13, and settlement is now moving
ahead.

6

There are, additionally, around 30 pending cases brought against Argentina by foreign investors, mainly in the
utilities sector, under the arbitration rules of ICSID.

Box 5. Structural Policy Implementation Under the
Fund-Supported Programs
In the area of structural policies, there has been little progress in implementing the reform agenda
envisaged under the stand-by arrangement.
•

Fiscal structural reforms. Some progress was made in modernizing tax administration, but the
government was unable to gather consensus to reform the intergovernmental revenue sharing system, and
fiscal responsibility legislation was passed that contained several weaknesses. Two tax amnesties were
approved despite explicit program commitments to the contrary and the export tax on oil products
increased. While the government did allow for partial cross-crediting of the financial transactions tax
against the income tax, this practice has significant administrative costs and was therefore less desirable
than a straight reduction.

•

Banking reforms. Compensation to banks for losses from asymmetric pesoization and the indexation of
balance sheets proved to be contentious.1 Despite last October’s Supreme Court decision in favor of the
constitutionality of the pesoization, the situation regarding bank losses from court injunctions (amparos)
is still unclear. After many delays, the strategic review and due diligence of one public bank has been
completed, but there has been no progress in respect of the largest public bank.

•

Utility sector reform. The program aimed to put in place a sound regulatory framework and complete
the renegotiation of long-term contracts with concessionaires by end-2004. Instead, a public services law
was submitted to Congress in August 2004 that contains important shortcomings, and there have been no
agreements so far on long-term contracts with some of the largest utility companies. The government
continues to be reluctant to countenance tariff increases for consumers.

•

Debt restructuring: Negotiations with private creditors were not constructive for the most part, and the
authorities did not take precautions, such as the steps laid out in the March 2004 Letter of Intent to avoid
a piecemeal approach (i.e., by setting an appropriate minimum participation threshold).2 Recent
legislation prohibiting the reopening of the exchange by the executive branch could hinder the resolution
of the remaining arrears with private creditors.
_____________________

Some banks dispute the authorities’ assessment of compensation for asymmetric pesoization and the methodology to
calculate the compensation for asymmetric indexation.

The authorities met with domestic and foreign creditor groups in March–April 2004, but these meetings were of
procedural nature and not followed up by substantive negotiations.

IV. MACROECONOMIC OUTLOOK AND RISKS
15.
While staff broadly agreed with the authorities’ macroeconomic outlook for
2005, the central bank’s inflation target range appears unlikely to be achieved on the
basis of current policies.
•

Growth is expected
to decelerate to
6–7 percent in 2005 as
capacity constraints are
reached. There is,
however, some upward
potential to this forecast,

given the high carryover from 2004. The authorities noted that consumption was still
strong, export volumes were rising, and that recent investments in machinery and
equipment would increase potential output. The authorities believe that recent higher
export volumes reflect the government’s policy to maintain a competitive exchange
rate.
•

The authorities have a more sanguine view on inflation than staff as they expect
to meet the central bank’s target range of 5–8 percent under current policies.
Staff were of the view that meeting the target would require an immediate tightening
of macroeconomic policies, in the absence of which, inflation would likely reach
double digits during 2005.7

•

It was agreed also that the external position would remain strong and further
accumulation of international reserves may be possible in 2005. A further increase
was, however, not assured as the current account surplus was expected to gradually
decline as a result of higher imports and interest payments. Scheduled IFI
amortization payments were also substantial during the remainder of the year.

16.
The main risk to the near-term outlook is that inflation is not contained. As
described in greater detail in Section V below, the authorities will need to take
macroeconomic policy measures to ensure that price rises are curbed during the second half
of 2005. In a number of sectors, particularly in energy and manufacturing, capacity
constraints are becoming more evident. In this situation, failure to have in place appropriate
macroeconomic policies risk giving rise to a wage-price spiral that could weaken Argentina’s
competitiveness and undermine prospects for a smooth deceleration from the high growth
rates of the recent past.
17.
On the medium-term outlook, with an appropriate policy framework, growth
could potentially average 3 percent, with inflation gradually declining, and the real
exchange rate appreciating (Table 12).8 While the authorities and staff broadly agreed on a
set of medium-term projections, there were clear differences on the underlying policy
requirements and risks involved in the scenario. Staff emphasized that achieving the baseline
growth forecast would require a sizable contribution from private investment, including from
foreign sources, and that this was unlikely to materialize under current policies. In the staff’s
view, the main risks for the medium-term outlook (which are described more fully in
Section VI below) are: (i) macroeconomic stability could be undermined by lack of progress
in institutional structural reforms, especially in the area of intergovernmental relations;
7

8

The May-2005 market consensus forecast for end-year inflation was 10 percent.

The projected long-term potential growth rate is consistent with net capital accumulation of 3–3½ percent,
labor input growth of about 1 percent, and total factor productivity growth of 1-1½ percent per year. Potential
growth estimates are, however, subject to a significant degree of uncertainty due to the high volatility of
Argentina's past economic performance. For a further discussion see Chapter I of the selected issues paper.

- 17 -

(ii) competitiveness could be weakened without productivity-enhancing structural reforms,
necessary tax policy changes, and a strengthening of the financial system; (iii) investor
confidence could be undermined by concerns over the business environment, legal
uncertainty, and state intervention; and (iv) capacity constraints could develop in certain
sectors, particularly in the energy sector if there is insufficient private sector investment in
gas and electricity distribution and generation.
18.
Staff contended that without adequate policies to guard against these risks,
growth could decline over the next few years to return to the low levels associated with
Argentina’s past history. The authorities stated, in response, that they were well aware of
the need to build policy credibility to support a conducive investment climate. They claimed,
however, that investment continued to be buoyant, demonstrating that the current policy
framework provided substantial profit opportunities for new investors. The authorities
dismissed concerns over potential energy shortages, though they agreed substantial new
investment would be needed in the coming years.
V. MACROECONOMIC POLICY ISSUES
A. Fiscal Policy
19.
The authorities’ 2005 target for the consolidated public sector primary surplus,
if realized, would represent a significant loosening of the fiscal stance (Box 6). Staff
noted that the 2005 consolidated primary surplus target of 3.8 percent of GDP was well
below the 2004 outcome, and that in the absence of a significant overperformance—similar
to that in 2004—the budget would have a procyclical impact, add to inflationary concerns,
and create a financing gap that could make it difficult for the government to meet its postrestructuring debt service obligations. The authorities were reluctant to commit to any
specific primary surplus beyond the budget target,

The authorities anticipate a substantial
budgetary financing gap in the remainder of
2005. They estimate that before market borrowing
(and without Fund disbursements) the financing gap
would be very large—about US$6.7 billion
(3.9 percent of GDP). In their debt sustainability
analysis (see below), they indicate that the 2005 gap
would be reduced to US$4.4 billion (2½ percent of

Consolidated Public Sector Balance

The consolidated public sector accounts improved
significantly during 2002–04. The primary balance
went from a deficit of 1.3 percent of GDP in 2001 to a
surplus of 5.1 percent of GDP in 2004.
The structural (cyclically-adjusted) primary
balance shows a similar pattern. While the structural
balance should proxy the discretionary policy effort, a
closer inspection suggests that the adjustment was
helped considerably by a surge in tax buoyancy––a
feature of many post-crisis episodes––and the
introduction of highly distortionary taxes.

The authorities’ fiscal targets for 2005, however,
imply a significant relaxation of the fiscal stance
(Box Figures and Table). A cyclically neutral fiscal

primary balance in 2005. If the authorities’ targets
were realized, the cyclically-adjusted fiscal relaxation
would be around 2 percent of GDP.

GDP) if Fund repurchases were offset by Fund disbursements from June 2005 through the
end of the year.9 Staff projections for 2005 indicate that a consolidated primary surplus of at
least 4½ percent of GDP would be needed to ensure that the government’s market borrowing
requirement would be at a feasible level (see Section VI below). Staff proposed expenditure
savings be considered as a means of achieving a higher than targeted primary surplus. The
mission suggested, as examples, that a reduction in government subsidies (which have
increased in recent years to 0.7 percent of GDP) and a prioritization of capital spending
(which is projected to increase by 53 percent year-on-year in 2005) could help secure
significant savings without having a negative social impact. Both of these options, however,
were thought not to be feasible by the authorities.
B. Monetary Policy
21.
The authorities view the recent increases in inflation as mainly the result of
transitory and seasonal factors, and changes in relative prices. They, thus, believe that it
would be a mistake to over-react in terms of policy tightening. They believed that interest
rates had already been increased sufficiently and that inflation expectations had stabilized. In
addition, they noted that recent voluntary short-term agreements with key producers of
foodstuffs would ensure that future price increases in these areas would be moderate.

In the staff’s view, the
balance of inflation risks has clearly
moved to the upside. While
recognizing the difficulty of identifying
the source of rising price pressures, the
recent inflation appears to be a product
of more permanent factors related to
rising demand in the context of higher
capacity utilization and monetary and
fiscal stimulus. Staff emphasized that
administrative controls and moral
suasion would have a dampening effect
on growth and would not curb
underlying inflationary pressures over
the longer term; indeed, they would
harbor the risk of a subsequent burst of
price increases.

Under current practice, the BCRA onlends Fund financing to the federal government in domestic currency

23.
Staff noted that monetary conditions were still very accommodative and that
further policy tightening would be appropriate (Text Figure). Staff noted that key policy
rates have lagged increases in inflation expectations and are still heavily negative in real
terms. Staff recommended that the trajectory of base money be brought down quickly to the
lower band of the central bank’s target range, noting this task had been made more difficult
by the increased foreign exchange intervention that occurred during April–May 2005. An
additional reason for caution was the sharp rise that had occurred in the money multiplier as
banks had increased their lending.

Staff cautioned that insufficient clarity as to the objectives of monetary policy
could damage the credibility of the central bank. In particular, the recent purchases of
foreign exchange appeared driven by the objective of avoiding an appreciation of the
nominal exchange rate, thereby placing at risk the achievement of the bank’s inflation target.
Staff underscored that the central bank should remain focused on its objective of price
stability and that a move toward an inflation targeting framework (as envisaged under the
SBA-supported program) would help establish this role. In response, the authorities indicated
that they were reviewing whether an inflation targeting framework was appropriate for
Argentina from an institutional viewpoint. They stressed that, in any case, inflation control
would be the prime objective of the central bank whether or not formal inflation targeting
was adopted. On the issue of foreign exchange intervention, the authorities indicated that
they did not have an implicit exchange rate or reserve accumulation target in mind. They
intend, however, to take the opportunity of building reserves whenever foreign exchange
inflows were seasonally strong.
C. Exchange Rate Policy
25.
The authorities viewed the maintenance of a competitive exchange rate as one of
the central components of their economic development strategy. They agreed with staff
that the real exchange rate would likely appreciate over time as the economic recovery
deepened and relative price changes took

However, the authorities noted that, while
the post-crisis appreciation of the peso had

26.
Staff emphasized the need for greater nominal exchange rate flexibility. Staff
noted that, while there was a need for the central bank to continue to augment reserves,
intervention should be carried out in a manner that did not effectively peg the exchange rate.
Staff noted that while Argentina had, de jure, a floating exchange rate regime, the exchange
rate had, in fact, been confined within a very narrow range, and could be classified under an
empirical rule as a currency peg. Staff stressed that continuing with such a policy risked that
real appreciation pressures would materialize in the form of domestic price inflation. It was
noted that external competitiveness would ultimately depend on structural reforms to
improve productivity and efficiency in the economy.
27.
There is an exchange restriction subject to Fund approval under Article VIII of
the Fund’s Articles arising from a freeze on programmed bank deposits (the corralón).
As of end-February, 2005, about Arg$1.3 billion remained subject to the restriction. The
freeze on deposits is scheduled to expire by end-September 2005 and staff recommends that
temporary approval of the restriction be extended until that date.
VI. STRUCTURAL REFORMS FOR SUSTAINING GROWTH
28.
The policy discussions focused on what were the key structural changes
necessary to maintain competitiveness and ensure continued robust growth. The
authorities considered that much had already been done to provide a firm foundation for
future growth, and noted particularly the renewed vitality of the small- and medium-sized
enterprise sector. Staff, however, pointed to key areas of continued vulnerability that, if not
addressed, would become obstacles to growth in the coming period. These include: (i) the
institutional structure for intergovernmental relations; (ii) the continued presence of highly
distortionary taxes; (iii) the lack of capital in the banking system; (iv) the weak investment
environment highlighted by the continuing disputes with the regulated public service
companies; (v) the need for very large investments in the energy sector in the near future; and
(vi) the large outstanding arrears to private sector creditors.
A. Fiscal Structural Reforms10
Intergovernmental reforms
29.
The volatility of fiscal policy appears to be an important factor in explaining
Argentina’s growth history.11 The inability of Argentina’s institutions to enforce fiscal
discipline was clearly evident in the genesis of the 2001–02 financial crisis. In the post-crisis
period, fiscal discipline has been restored, but this has been in a situation where financing has
been constrained both for the federal and provincial governments. The staff noted that a core
element of staff and Executive Board advice over the past two or three years has been to
10

11

See Chapter I in the selected issues paper.

- 22 -

implement institutional changes that would entrench fiscal discipline in a more normal
situation where financing was more freely available. In the staff’s view, the recent strong
fiscal performance has obscured the long-standing problems of the fiscal federal regime and
that institutional changes in the areas of the Fiscal Responsibility Law and the Law on
Revenue Sharing are key conditions for lasting growth in Argentina.
30.
The authorities were more confident than staff that the recently adopted Fiscal
Responsibility Law (FRL) would entrench fiscal discipline. They indicated that the law
had been already ratified by 17 of the 24 provinces, representing about 77 percent of total
provincial spending, and that the Federal Council for Fiscal Responsibility was just
beginning its work.12 In combination with bilateral agreements between the federal
government and the indebted provinces, the FRL would give assurances of prudent
provincial fiscal behavior by limiting the growth in current spending and debt accumulation,
and by improving transparency. Staff reiterated the concerns expressed at the time of the
law’s approval, including that the legislation fails to provide hard constraints on subnational
spending and borrowing;13 does not specify the circumstances under which the federal
government may provide financing to the provinces; does not contain a mechanism to ensure
subnational budgets are consistent with aggregate fiscal objectives; and continues to allow
provinces to pledge their coparticipation receipts for future debt service. Staff stated that a
comprehensive reform of the FRL was needed, but in the short term, as an interim measure
the charter for the Federal Council should be widened to give the institution a stronger
mandate to coordinate macro-fiscal policy, authorize intergovernmental financing operations,
and provide recommendations for remedial actions when provinces violate spending, deficit,
or debt limits specified in the FRL. The authorities, however, believed it was premature to
amend the law or the council’s charter. They indicated only that consideration could be given
to whether the council could monitor more widely the overall financial situation of provinces
and better harmonize the fiscal policies of the federal and provincial governments.
31.
Staff argued that strengthening the revenue sharing regime was a critical reform
measure that would support the recommended changes to the FRL. Staff suggested that
the government simplify the current intergovernmental transfer system, increase its
transparency, reduce the reliance on discretionary transfers, and increase the weight of
objective criteria in determining the interprovincial distribution of transfers. To improve
incentives for fiscal probity and revenue collection at the provincial level, staff argued that
there should be greater devolution of revenue-raising responsibilities to the provinces and
12

The Federal Council for Fiscal Responsibility, composed of the ministers of economy of the participating
provinces, monitors compliance with the law, including through the application of sanctions. See also Chapter II
of the selected issues paper.

13

The deficit and spending growth limits in the FRL exclude IFI–financed expenditures and virtually all capital
spending while the debt limits are expressed on debt service over a single year. Penalties for noncompliance
with the law are only vaguely defined, and the federal government has considerable discretion to waive the
limits established in the FRL.

- 23 -

that there should be an effort to reduce the procyclicality of federal government transfers.
The mission acknowledged that such a reform would ultimately result in changes in the
distribution of resources between the federal and provincial levels of government, as well as
among provinces (benefiting, in particular, some of the more populated provinces) and that,
therefore, it would be necessary to phase in the reform in a gradual manner. The authorities,
however, argued that the reforms advocated by staff were not politically feasible even with
gradual phasing. In the view of the authorities, the experience of 200414 had shown that
achieving political consensus in this area was extremely difficult; in their view, the situation
at that time had been exacerbated by the conditionality that had been included in the Fundsupported program. The authorities were, thus, extremely skeptical that advances could be
made in this area, and certainly not in the short term.
Tax policy reforms
32.
The tax system still contains important distortions, introduced in the wake of the
financial crisis, that constrain growth prospects. The export and financial transaction
taxes, which inhibit financial intermediation and the prospects for export-led growth,
comprise about 18 percent of federally collected revenues, and directly support the federal

and increase the
competitiveness of Argentina’s key exports. The authorities agreed with the need to phase
out some of these taxes—especially the financial transactions tax—but argued that
substituting these taxes would be politically difficult. The staff made a number of specific
recommendations to improve the tax structure,15 but the authorities felt that none of these
recommendations could be implemented, at least during the current year. They also pointed
out that new taxes would need to be shared with provinces and would therefore weaken the
federal budget. In this context, staff suggested that consideration be given to the possibility of
reducing discretionary federal transfers so as to protect the federal budget.
14

In 2004, the authorities attempted a reform of the coparticipation regime. However, the proposal aimed to
increase centralization and strengthen federal government influence and failed to garner provincial support.

15

A FAD technical assistance mission in 2003 recommended among other options to eliminate unwarranted
income and VAT exemptions and cross-crediting, align excises to their regional level, include excises in the
VAT base, and strengthen the collection of social security and real estate taxes.

- 24 -

B. The Banking Sector
33.
There was agreement that Argentina needs to strengthen its banking sector and
deepen financial intermediation to sustain growth in the medium term. However, the
banking system continues to be affected by the consequences of various policy actions
undertaken during the financial crisis (Box 7). In particular: the government has not yet
completed the compensation to the banks for asymmetric pesoization and indexation of bank
assets and liabilities; many banks still need to deal with significant losses arising from court
injunctions (amparos) despite decisions from the Supreme Court that confirm the legality of
the pesoization of deposits; the share of the banking system in the hands of the state has
increased sharply; the share of public securities in banks’ portfolios has risen substantially;
banks’ exposure to interest rate risk has increased; and banks are severely undercapitalized
even though they meet current regulatory standards that extend temporary forbearance.
34.
Staff stressed the continued
vulnerability of the banking system,
despite its recent return to
profitability. In the staff’s view, the
policy priorities going forward would
be to (i) complete the compensation
payments; (ii) steadily remove the
regulatory forbearance; (iii) increase
bank capitalization; and (iv) clarify the
legal status of amparos.

Losses from Amparos have been a significant drag
on bank profitability.

for asymmetric pesoization and

bulk of compensation for asymmetric pesoization would be fully completed in June,
2005.16 They also claimed that compensation for asymmetric indexation was no
longer an issue as banks had not put forward any final claims. Staff noted that several
banks continue to dispute the methodology adopted by the government to calculate
the compensation.

(ii)

The authorities reiterated their intention to adhere to the current schedule for phasing
out regulatory forbearance, and agreed with staff that they should be ready to take
prompt corrective actions to ensure banks meet prudential standards.

16

Under the latest information available to staff, the authorities have completed payments for asymmetric
pesoization of Arg$16 billion out of Arg$18 billion for the losses due to asymmetric pesoization, but the BCRA
is still discussing the compensation for the losses arising from the pesoization of assets relative to other
liabilities governed by foreign law (estimated at Arg$10 billion).

Political instability

The recent financial crisis hit Argentina’s banking
system hard. During the 1990s, the banking system
underwent significant transformation, that included a
strengthening of the regulatory framework, increased
bank liquidity and capitalization, and greater foreign
participation. Nevertheless, the events of 2001–02
crippled the banking system due to a sharp drain on
deposits, a significant increase in credit risk following
the devaluation, and the default on public sector
liabilities (which made up 50 percent of bank assets).

•

In mid-2001, the government undertook a
“mega swap” of government liabilities held by
domestic financial institutions for new instruments with longer maturity that increased the maturity
mismatch on bank balance sheets.

•

In December 2001, the government announced a series of restrictions on withdrawals from the banks
(the corralito) and introduced a debt moratorium.

•

In January 2002, the convertibility regime was finally abandoned and the resulting spike in the
exchange rate led to a sharp increase in nonperforming loans.

•

In February 2002, the maturity of time deposits was extended (the corralón) and bank balance sheets
were pesoized at asymmetric rates (Arg$1 per US$ for assets and Arg$1.4 for liabilities).

•

In May 2002, assets and liabilities were indexed differentially (assets were indexed to inflation and a
wage index while liabilities were linked to inflation).

•

Since the pesoization in February 2002, depositors have resorted to courts requesting compensation for
losses incurred by the pesoization at an exchange rate below market rates. Court injunctions have been
granted by the judiciary, generating net losses to the banks estimated at Arg$ 8.8 billion.

In response to the crisis, the authorities granted regulatory forbearance as part of their strategy to
promote a gradual recovery of the banking sector. A valuation mechanism for government bonds and loans
was established, which allows for a gradual convergence to market value. Banks were also allowed to
temporarily decrease their capital charge on interest rate risk, a measure that is scheduled to be phased out by
end-2006. Finally, losses incurred due to court injunctions (amparos) could be booked as assets to be amortized
over a period of 60 months.
Looking ahead, a full recovery of the banking system will depend to a significant extent on the resolution
of the various policy-induced losses. Continued improvements in the macroeconomic environment and the
gradual phasing out of regulatory forbearance are also key for re-establishing a sound banking sector.

(iii)

The authorities indicated that they were also weighing the possibility of providing
some marginal incentives for early recapitalization, but did not have a specific
proposal at this time.17

(iv)

Finally, the authorities acknowledged the importance of providing greater clarity on
the legal status of amparo claims, but insisted that this was an issue for the judiciary
and not the executive.

35.
Staff regretted the delays in the long-overdue strategic review of the public
banks, and emphasized that this was only the initial step in the reform process. The
review for Banco Provincia has been completed and the government has recently contracted
consultants to undertake the review of Banco Nación.18 Staff noted that once the review of
Banco Nación was concluded, the authorities should quickly establish a medium-term action
plan to improve the operational performance of the two banks and define their future role
within the overall banking system.
C. The Business Climate and Public Services
36.
Staff contended that the lack of progress in reaching agreement with the utility
company concessionaires had wide implications, not only for the provision of public
services, but also for the business climate (Box 8). In particular, staff pointed to the
adverse consequences of the government’s recent decision to impose solutions on the
companies both in the regulated sector and through exerting moral suasion on investment
schemes for electricity generation. The decisions of certain companies to leave Argentina and
the threat of others to withdraw would have a powerful impact on other potential investors.19
Staff argued that, while much time had been lost, the priority should now be to re-establish a
credible time-bound program for the renegotiation of long-term contracts with
concessionaires that would include a clear path for tariff adjustments. Although tariff
increases were not the only issue separating the government and the companies, this was a
critical element, especially in the gas and electricity sectors where many systemically
important concessions remained undecided and where infrastructure bottlenecks affecting
growth were most likely to occur.

17

Such incentives could include allowing banks that bring in capital faster than required under current
regulations to begin paying dividends and to qualify for early repayment of central bank liquidity assistance at
favorable rates.

18

The assessment of Banco Provincia identified several areas to be strengthened to improve the overall
performance of the bank: better risk assessment and monitoring systems; more efficient loan collection
mechanisms; and improvements in governance and management practices. A dedicated task force has been
created within the bank to take these reforms forward.

19

- 27 -

Box 8. The Status of Public Services Reforms
Private sector participation in the provision of public services requires a stable regulatory environment
and price mechanisms that allow firms to earn an appropriate return on capital. To this end, the
government committed under the Fund supported program to reach long-term concession agreements—
including tariff adjustments—with 63 regulated utility companies by end-2004, and put in place a new
regulatory framework.
Renegotiation of concessions
Progress towards the renegotiation of the key utility concessions has been scant. Of the total of
63 concessions, agreements were only reached with four electricity companies, four highway concessions, four
port concessions, and two freight railways operators.2 Most of these agreements still require congressional
approval and do not involve, by and large, tariff increases for household consumers.3 Thirteen road-related
contracts were rescinded, and the government reauctioned the concessions. In addition, the government took
control of the postal services concession and has announced that the company will not be reprivatized.
Little progress has been made in renegotiating remaining contracts, including for systemically important
gas, electricity, water and telecommunications companies, which account for about 85 percent of total
public service revenues. Moreover, the government launched public hearings for the energy companies that
had not reached agreements with the authorities. During the hearings, the companies rejected the government’s
unilateral offer as insufficient.
Regulatory framework
The government’s draft proposal for a new regulatory framework for public services has important
shortcomings—an assessment shared by the World Bank and other observers. Among its main
shortcomings, the law: (i) fails to establish a regular and predictable process for updating tariffs to reflect
changing economic conditions; (ii) provides excessive scope for the Government and consumer groups to
request tariff reductions on grounds of efficiency gains; (iii) denies concessionaires the right to apply for
international arbitration; and (iv) prevents the disconnection of service to nonpaying customers. Discussion of
this law in Congress has been delayed and is unlikely to take place in the near term.
Implications
Lack of progress in utility reforms has wide implications, as it contributes to a weakened investment
climate, infrastructure bottlenecks, and contingent fiscal liabilities. In response to last winter’s energy
shortages, the authorities lifted the price freeze in some non-regulated sectors (including for the gas used by
industry and electricity generators), but the price increases were not passed on to consumers, so that the
government had to subsidize the price difference. Utility companies have now filed some 30 cases against the
government in the World Bank Arbitration Tribunal (ICSID) that represent a potentially large contingent
liability. The lack of progress in the renegotiation of contracts has contributed to the announced decision of
several foreign investors to withdraw from Argentina's public service concessions.4
_____________
1/ See also Chapter III of the selected issues paper.
2/ Interim agreements were reached with the water company and two fixed-line telephone companies, but these expired in
December 2004 and negotiations for the new long-term contracts are ongoing.
3/ In the case of the electricity companies, the agreement would result in a 15–31 percent adjustment in tariffs for industrial
users, with additional tariff increases to be negotiated during 2005. Toll hikes would range between 14–18 percent, while the
port and railroad concessions include no tariff adjustments.
4/ More recently, investors such as Suez/Aguas de Barcelona in the water provision sector and EDF in electricity
distribution and transport have announced their departures, and other companies in the energy sector, such as National Grid,
PSEG and CMS have sold their stakes to domestic investors.

- 28 -

37.
A new effort to reach collaborative agreements would be facilitated by the
establishment of a sound and balanced regulatory regime. Staff pointed out that the draft
public services law currently in Congress was not supportable and would need to be modified
to provide adequate incentives for continued private sector participation in the regulated
sectors. Staff emphasized that the amendments should strike an adequate balance between
consumer protection and the need of the concessionaires for economic viability and
contractual certainty. In particular, staff urged the authorities to take into consideration the
recommendations made on the draft law by the World Bank staff. Only with an appropriate
regulatory framework, and certainty as to financial incentives over the medium term, would
adequate investment be made in these sectors. The staff also encouraged the authorities to
implement a transparent and well-targeted social tariff scheme.
38.
There are a significant number of claims relating to the utility sector that are
pending in the international arbitration tribunals. The authorities questioned the validity
of these claims and argued that there had been no discriminatory treatment of international
investors in the implementation of the emergency law. Staff suggested that the best way to
reduce the risks from any adverse decision would be to reach early agreements with the
concessionaires which could result in the voluntary withdrawal of claims by the companies.
However, the authorities emphasized that the companies would have to withdraw their legal
claims against the government before signing new contracts. They also suggested that any
negative decision in the international tribunals would, in any case, have to be reviewed by the
Argentine courts in order to be enforced in Argentina, and at that stage it could be challenged
by consumer associations, thereby potentially blocking the enforcement of the international
tribunal decision.
D. Social and Infrastructure Policy
39.
The basic social priorities of the government are to improve the situation of the
poor by expanding employment opportunities, raising minimum wages, maintaining a
safety net, and ensuring access to education and social services. Since the beginning of
2003, about 3.5 million Argentines have moved out of poverty and almost 4 million have
moved out of extreme poverty (Box 2). Unemployment has fallen with job creation in both
formal and informal markets. Under the main social safety net program, the Heads of
Household Program, the number of beneficiaries has declined to 1.5 million in February
2005 from 2.1 million at the end of 2002. The staff suggested that the improved trends
provide an opportunity to reexamine the government’s social programs. The authorities
agreed and indicated that in the medium term they would like to replace the emergency social
program with a training program and a more narrowly defined and well-targeted
unemployment subsidy plan. Moreover, they felt that Argentina would need to strengthen its
unemployment insurance system to further improve the safety net for transitional
unemployment. On education, they believed that there was a need to increase spending and
had announced a goal of 6 percent of GDP in education expenditures by 2015 (from about
4 percent in 2004).

- 29 -

40.
There was consensus on the need to prioritize government capital expenditure to
allow for higher and more efficient spending on infrastructure. The authorities pointed
out that Argentina has significant medium term infrastructure investment needs and that, as a
first step, they had increased investment spending in the 2005 budget by 1.3 percent of GDP.
Staff agreed that while some increase in infrastructure spending may be appropriate, it would
be important, given the size of infrastructure needs, to mobilize and provide incentives for
private sector investment in infrastructure, so as not to crowd out government spending in
other areas.
VII. MEDIUM-TERM OUTLOOK AND DEBT SUSTAINABILITY
41.
The authorities’ debt sustainability analysis (Scenario A) shows a relatively fast
decline in the debt-to-GDP ratio over the next decade. The principal assumptions made by
the authorities (detailed in Annex I) are that all defaulted debt is restructured during 2005 on
the same terms as the recent debt exchange; growth averages 3 percent over the medium
term; the real exchange rate gradually appreciates; borrowing costs on new debt are 9 percent
in dollar terms; exposure to IFIs remains constant through 2014 and declines slowly
thereafter; central bank advances to the government are not used to finance debt service; the
federal primary surplus is maintained at 3 percent of GDP in the near term; and, provincial
governments generate sufficient primary surpluses to cover their own debt service. Under

3/ The financing capacity in each scenario is the difference between financing needs and identified resources, which include staff's estimate of possible market access.

these assumptions, the debt-to-GDP ratio declines from 79 percent in 2005 to 50 percent by
2014 and to 40 percent by 2020. 20 The authorities also assume market access which would
allow a near 70 percent rollover of private sector debt in the period 2005–08, rising to higher
levels thereafter under the assumption that it becomes possible to tap international markets.

20

Given the back-loaded nature of obligations on restructured debt, the NPV of the debt stock in 2005 is about
19 percentage points less than the face value at a 10 percent discount rate.

- 30 -

42.
The scenario presented by the authorities is based on several key unrealistic
assumptions. Staff would argue that, based on current policies, it would be more realistic to
assume the following:
•

In the absence of a well articulated structural policy framework supportive of higher
investment and productivity, average medium-term growth is likely to be closer to 2
percent than the 3 percent assumed by the authorities;

•

The debt sustainability analysis should not assume access to Fund financial support.
The authorities’ assumption of constant exposure to the Fund for an extended period
is neither realistic nor necessary. Fund purchases should not be relied upon as a
source of budgetary financing even though this has long been the practice in
Argentina.

•

Under current policies, inflation and borrowing costs, at least in the near term, are
likely to be at higher levels than assumed by the authorities.

Under these alternative assumptions, as shown in Scenario B, the debt ratio follows an
unsustainable path, remaining around 70 percent of GDP over the medium term, and the
implied rollover rate for private sector borrowing rises to unsustainable levels. Compared
with the staff estimate of possible market access, this scenario gives rise to significant
financing gaps both in the near and medium term.
43.
The staff’s debt sustainability analysis (Scenario C) is based on a reform
scenario which underpins higher growth, lower inflation, and lower borrowing costs
than in Scenario B. In this projection, staff assumes an increased fiscal effort with
consolidated primary surpluses reaching 4.5 percent of GDP over the next few years and
declining gradually thereafter. Staff argued that such surpluses were both feasible and
appropriate given the level of Argentina’s indebtedness. The staff scenario indicates
sustainability over the medium term, with a similar downward trajectory of the overall debtto-GDP ratio as in Scenario A, though at a slightly faster pace. In the near-term, however,
there are large gross debt obligations that average about 8 percent of GDP during 2005–08,
including substantial debt service to the Fund averaging almost 2 percent of GDP per year.
Under this scenario, and in the absence of direct recourse to central bank reserves, a rollover
rate of private sector debt of more than 100 percent is required during 2005–08. This level of
required market access is higher than the possible access estimated by staff, thereby giving
rise to financing gaps during 2005–08 even though adequate market access is projected over
the medium term. While it is possible that the required level of market access may be
achievable over the next few years, the likelihood is that borrowing costs may be higher than
assumed and that this would cause a significant increase in the exposure of domestic
financial institutions to the public sector.
44.
Staff suggested that, following the practice in many other countries, Fund
repurchases could be made by the central bank from international reserves, rather than
financed by the federal budget. Since the currency board regime, the central bank has

- 31 -

onlent Fund resources to the federal government to help finance its budget deficit. The
central bank’s claim on government matches exactly the terms of its obligations to the Fund.
To allow international reserves to be used directly to finance Fund repurchases, however,
changes in the central bank’s charter may be necessary.
45.
Financing payments to the Fund directly from the central bank’s international
reserves would significantly lower the required market issuances and allow a more
rapid reduction in the debt ratio. As shown in the staff Scenario D, the medium-term debt
path is sustainable—the debt-to-GDP ratio would fall to 40 percent by 2016—and, in the
near term, the required private sector rollover rate (34 percent) should be easily achievable.
Under these conditions, there are financing surpluses in each period, indicating that
Argentina’s capacity to pay is higher than the projected debt obligations provided the
assumed fiscal effort and market access are achieved. The extent of the excess capacity is
about ½ percent of GDP per year over the projection period.
46.
To change Argentina’s current practice in regard to Fund purchases and
repurchases, a decision would need to be taken at the highest political level. According
to central bank officials, this would necessitate an amendment of the central bank’s charter
which would require congressional approval. Such an amendment, while easing the financing
constraints in the near term, would need to be done in a manner that would not weaken the
central bank’s balance sheet or income position, and maintain its independence from
government.
47.
The results of the staff’s debt sustainability analysis are generally robust, but are
sensitive to growth assumptions. As demonstrated earlier in Scenario B, the average growth
rate over the medium term has a significant impact on debt sustainability. A reduction in the
average growth rate would leave the debt ratio at vulnerable levels for a longer period. In the
staff scenarios (C and D) a 1 percentage point reduction in growth, would imply four
additional years for the debt-to-GDP ratio to decline below 50 percent. The projection of the
real exchange rate could also be critical. In the staff scenarios, the assumption is made that
the current rate is close to its long-term equilibrium and there will be a gradual appreciation
over the coming period. Such projections are, of course, very difficult to make. If it is the
case that the rate is currently undervalued, then additional appreciation will help the debt
dynamics going forward. For example, if the real exchange rate were to be 10 percent more
appreciated than under the baseline scenario, then the debt stock would decrease by
8 percentage points of GDP. Changes to the level of borrowing costs and repayment terms
would affect the staff conclusions only if there are extreme changes. Sensitivity tests for
these and other variables are included in Annex I.
VIII. NORMALIZATION OF DEBT SERVICE ARREARS
48.
In discussing the debt exchange, staff stressed the potential adverse impact on
debt sustainability that would result from continued arrears to private creditors. In
regard to the debt exchange itself, staff regretted that the authorities’ approach was not
consistent with the commitments included in the Letter of Intent of March 2004 which would

- 32 -

have allowed Argentina to comply with the Fund’s lending into arrears policy. A full
description of the debt exchange process is contained in Chapter IV of the selected issues
papers. In respect of the remaining debt in default, staff noted that litigation risks and
associated costs could disrupt Argentina’s future market access. The authorities indicated that
they were considering various modalities to normalize the situation with private creditors that
had not participated in the debt exchange but, at present, were not prepared to elaborate,
stating that their main focus was on settlement of the debt exchange and the issuance of new
securities to participating creditors. Staff noted that the IMFC communiqué had called upon
Argentina to formulate a forward-looking strategy to resolve the remaining arrears
outstanding to private creditors consistent with the IMF’s lending into arrears policy. Staff
also noted that the debt exchange law passed by congress limited the power of the executive
to effect judicial or nonjudicial settlements with nonparticipating creditors or to re-open the
debt exchange. Given this situation, an amendment or repeal of the law would appear
necessary for the authorities to effectively address the issue of the arrears to nonparticipating
creditors. In response, the authorities stated that it was their intention to formulate a forwardlooking strategy in due course, but it would be premature to make any announcement on this
issue at this stage, and that it was not clear whether changes to the legal framework would be
necessary.
49.
The authorities and staff agreed that it would be important for Argentina to
proceed to negotiations with the Paris Club. The authorities indicated that the terms of
restructuring for official bilateral debt in the debt sustainability analysis were an example and
should not prejudice the future negotiations with the Paris Club.
50.
The staff urged the authorities to remain current with all multilaterals,
including the European Investment Bank (EIB). In regard to the EIB, in a July 2004
informal meeting, staff informed Executive Directors that Argentina had accumulated arrears
with the EIB which therefore caused the nonobservance of a continuous performance
criterion on the nonaccumulation of arrears to bilateral and multilateral creditors. On August
30, 2004, at an informal country matters session, staff updated Executive Directors on this
issue, indicating that the arrears gave rise to noncomplying purchases under the January 2003
SBA and the September 2003 SBA. On January 24, 2005, at an informal country matters
session, staff informed Executive Directors that Argentina had cleared all arrears on principal
and past due interest with the EIB in December 2004, but that penalty interest on the cleared
arrears still remained a subject of ongoing discussions between the Argentine authorities and
the EIB. Given this situation the staff recommended that the Board return to the issue
following the outcome of the discussions between the authorities and the EIB. The topic of
EIB arrears was raised by Executive Directors at a Board meeting to consider the extension
of repurchase expectations on May 18, 2005. They inquired whether a request for a waiver
for the noncomplying purchases would be brought to the Board’s agenda in the near future.
Staff indicated that a paper on this issue would be issued to the Board ahead of the Article IV
consultation with Argentina.

- 33 -

IX. STAFF APPRAISAL
51.
Argentina is emerging from an extraordinarily difficult period in its history, and
has achieved a significant measure of political, social, and financial stability. Since 1998,
the country has experienced a major recession, the largest financial crisis in its history, and a
period of severe social problems reflecting historically high levels of poverty and
unemployment. Since 2003, however, confidence has begun to return, helped by a successful
political transition and responsible macroeconomic policies. After two years of remarkable
growth, which continues into 2005, real wages are recovering, output is close to its pre-1998
peak, investment and exports are reaching record levels, financial markets are relatively
stable, and unemployment and poverty indicators are gradually improving. The Article IV
consultation discussions have provided a valuable opportunity to discuss the policy
framework that would entrench these achievements and ensure long-term growth, thereby
allowing a further improvement in social and poverty indicators.
52.
Thus, while much has been accomplished, many challenges lie ahead if the
current recovery is to be converted into long-lasting and equitable growth. The
experience of Argentina over the long term is that high growth periods have been
interspersed with drastic crises—often associated with fiscal volatility—that have reduced
average per capita growth to a very low level. The current growth momentum and
accompanying political stability provide the opportunity for the government to undertake
policies that will help prevent a repetition of Argentina’s historical experience. For the
recovery to be sustained, the authorities need to take action on a number of fronts: to
continue with responsible macroeconomic policies, mindful particularly of debt dynamics
and the adverse impact of inflation; to undertake structural reforms that will boost factor
productivity and potential output; to strengthen financial intermediation, guard against capital
flight, and normalize relations with creditors; to create a conducive investment climate for
both domestic and foreign investors; and to ensure that the fruits of growth are equitably
shared and that the still vulnerable sections of the community are adequately protected.
53.
Prudent macroeconomic policies during 2003–04 provided the anchor for the
recovery of confidence and credibility. Of critical importance was a steadfast
implementation of fiscal policy, which produced record levels of primary surplus in the
Argentinean context. With a strong improvement in tax collections and primary surpluses at
both the federal and provincial levels, the authorities demonstrated the potential for
Argentina to move away from its high level of national indebtedness. At the same time,
monetary policy took advantage of a resurging demand for pesos, rebuilding international
reserves and keeping interest rates low, thereby helping the recovery of the banking system.
The achievement of two years of low inflation in the 4–6 percent range was key to restoring
investor and consumer confidence.
54.
In 2005, however, as the output gap continues to close, the macroeconomic policy
stance has weakened, and this has been reflected in an acceleration of inflation. The
increase in consumer prices and price expectations in the first part of 2005 should not be
regarded as purely transitory, but rather as a signal of the need for tightening of both fiscal

- 34 -

and monetary policies. The authorities’ efforts to apply moral suasion and administrative
measures to stabilize prices are likely to have, at best, a short-term temporary impact, and
will have other undesirable consequences, in particular, on investment. In the absence of a
change to current macroeconomic policies, inflation could reach double digit levels this year,
necessitating harsher measures later to prevent a wage-price escalation.
55.
In the fiscal area, the 2005 primary surplus target of 3.8 percent of GDP is well
below the outcome for 2004. Thus, the budget will have a procyclical impact unless there is
a significant overperformance. The consolidated primary surplus target for 2005 represents a
sizeable injection of fiscal stimulus at a time when the output gap is closing and inflationary
pressures are mounting. Based on the strong outturn for the first quarter of 2005, the
authorities have indicated that there is some potential for fiscal overperformance this year,
and staff would urge that specific measures be put in place to ensure that the primary surplusto-GDP ratio is raised significantly closer to the level achieved in 2004, and at least
4.5 percent of GDP, so as to minimize any procyclical impact. This will likely require some
prioritization of capital spending and a review of the poorly targeted and rapidly rising
current subsidies. Further fiscal consolidation compared with the budget is also called for to
help facilitate—in a noninflationary and nondebt creating manner—the closing of a projected
budgetary financing gap in the second half of 2005.
56.
Additional tightening of monetary policy is likely to also be needed in the short
term. The authorities have made welcome efforts during this year to gradually withdraw
monetary stimulus and signal a tightening of monetary policy. However, nominal interest
rates have risen more slowly than inflation expectations and real rates remain in negative
territory. Given the stronger-than-expected recovery of the money multiplier, the central
bank should take measures to ensure that the path of base money is quickly adjusted to the
lower end of the authorities’ target range. This will likely require a moderation of the
authorities’ intervention in the foreign exchange market and possibly a further rise in interest
rates.
57.
To enhance the credibility of central bank policies to tackle inflation, the
objectives of monetary policy need to be clarified. For most of 2004, the central bank was
able to successfully pursue twin objectives of low inflation and exchange rate stability while
keeping interest rates low. In de facto terms, the nominal exchange rate has been restricted to
within a very narrow range for some time. Recently, monetary policy appears increasingly
driven by the need to prevent a nominal appreciation of the peso. Such a policy will not in
the staff’s view achieve the authorities’ stated goal of a maintaining a competitive currency.
Rather, it will lead to pressures for real appreciation being realized through higher inflation.
It is recommended that the authorities clarify publicly that the prime objective of monetary
policy is the maintenance of price stability and that the central bank has the necessary
operational autonomy to effectively combat inflation.
58.
A shift in this direction will require the authorities to accept a greater degree of
nominal exchange rate flexibility. The balance of payments has remained strong and the
government may still be able to build international reserves further during the remainder of

- 35 -

the year. However, intervention should not be carried out with an objective of maintaining a
particular nominal exchange rate; rather intervention should be transparent and carefully
coordinated so as to not undermine the targeted base monetary program or compromise the
government’s commitment to achieving its inflation targets.
59.
In the area of structural policies, there has been little progress in implementing
the reform agenda envisaged under the stand-by arrangement. The critical reforms
remain the reduction of distortions in tax policy, measures to strengthen the institutional
framework of intergovernmental fiscal relations, policies to strengthen the capital base of the
banking system, and a strategy that will ensure adequate investment and incentives for
participation by the private sector in the provision of public services. Although, for some
structural reforms, it may be difficult to obtain political consensus in an election year and, for
others, phased implementation may be needed, the staff would urge the authorities to utilize
the current favorable situation as a platform to announce a coherent action plan to address
these issues, including upfront actions to provide credibility going forward.
60.
Structural fiscal reforms are crucial to sustain over the medium term the strong
budgetary performance of the past two years, and enhance prospects for growth. For
most of Argentina’s recent history, the weakness of its fiscal institutions has been a key cause
of economic volatility. It is imperative, therefore, that a stronger institutional fiscal
framework be built as quickly as possible. This would cover three broad areas. First, the
approved Fiscal Responsibility Law needs to be strengthened in a comprehensive manner,
inter alia, to place more binding constraints on provincial spending and borrowing, to limit
the circumstances under which the federal government may provide financing to the
provinces, and to provide a mechanism to better harmonize the fiscal policies of the
provinces and the federal government. Second, the regime for intragovernmental revenue
sharing needs to be overhauled to reduce the level of vertical imbalance, lessen the
vulnerability of subnational finances to cyclical movements, and promote horizontal equity
among the provinces. Third, the distortionary taxes on exports and financial transactions need
to be phased out, and substitute revenue measures introduced, in order to promote greater
intermediation and export-led growth. These reforms are politically very complex, but will
pay clear dividends over the medium term. They are also a necessary complement to
redirecting public spending to improve infrastructure support within the framework of
assuring debt sustainability.
61.
While the banking system has returned to overall profitability, the sector still
remains vulnerable and undercapitalized. The authorities are to be commended for
maintaining their supervisory and regulatory framework under very difficult circumstances.
However, several issues have still to be resolved to allow the banking system to play its role
in promoting growth. In particular, pending compensation for policy–induced losses should
be quickly completed, and all efforts should be made to obtain a further judicial clarification
on the issue of amparo-induced losses. The authorities should strictly adhere to the
announced phase-in schedule of prudential regulations on the valuation of government bonds
and on limits on bank exposure to the public sector. The accompanying need to augment
capital will not only be met through the inflow of future profits but will also need an

- 36 -

injection of new capital. A strengthening of incentives for early recapitalization may be
helpful, though ultimately decisions to recapitalize will depend on the prevailing business
environment and the overall economic prospects. Through this process, the central bank
should continue to ensure prudential standards are applied strictly.
62.
The public banks have emerged from the crisis playing a much larger role and
the government should urgently articulate a strategy for their future operations. On the
basis of the completed review of Banco Provincia and the planned review of Banco Nación,
the authorities should be prepared to clarify the strategic role of these public banks going
forward.
63.
The situation in the regulated utilities sector is not sustainable and failure to
resolve outstanding issues will have damaging consequences for macroeconomic
stability and future growth. Despite commitments under the Stand-By Arrangement to
complete renegotiations with concessionaires during 2004, little progress has been achieved.
While the issue of tariffs does not affect all of the utility companies, the authorities’
reluctance to raise tariffs for end-consumers or to agree on long-term phased increases in
prices has been at the heart of the differences with the owners of many energy-related
concessions. The authorities’ insistence on retaining the complex procedures of the
Emergency Law, and the recent attempts to unilaterally impose new contracts, have been
strongly opposed by the companies, some of whom have withdrawn or are threatening
withdrawal from the country. This issue has thus become an important litmus test of the
overall investment climate. Staff believes that the authorities should proceed along twin
tracks of continuing to try to reach collaborative long-term agreements with the utility
concessionaires, while also putting in place an updated regulatory framework. Such a
framework should provide regulatory certainty and find an appropriate balance between
protection of consumers and provision of necessary investment incentives.
64.
The recent debt exchange marked an important step, but addressing remaining
arrears is essential for Argentina to fully emerge from the financial crisis. Staff regrets
that the authorities’ approach to the debt exchange was not consistent with the commitments
made in the letter of intent of March 2004. Once the exchange has been formally completed,
it will be important for Argentina to formulate a forward-looking strategy to resolve the
remaining arrears outstanding to private creditors consistent with the Fund’s Lending into
Arrears policy, and to normalize relations with bilateral official creditors through a Paris
Club agreement. The authorities’ presentation of their debt sustainability analysis shows the
debt-to-GDP ratio falling to relatively comfortable levels by 2015. The staff believes the
medium-term macroeconomic framework underlying the authorities’ analysis is feasible,
though not on the basis of current policies. The attainment of an average real growth of 3
percent per year can be achieved only with proactive structural policies to encourage
investment, both domestic and foreign. The staff’s clear view is that the authorities’
assumption of full and partial rollovers of obligations to the Fund for the next 15–20 years is
unacceptable: it is not only inconsistent with the revolving nature of Fund resources, but also
unnecessary. A more realistic assumption, in line with the balance of payments outlook,
would be an exit from the use of Fund resources at a much earlier stage. Finally, the

- 37 -

authorities’ debt sustainability analysis contains large financing gaps, particularly through
2012, that would need to be financed through market borrowing.
65.
The staff’s analysis of medium-term debt sustainability is based on a proactive
reform scenario and higher fiscal effort. Under these assumptions, which involve a level of
consolidated primary surplus of at least 4½ percent of GDP in the next few years, the debt-toGDP ratio could be brought down to sustainable levels over the next decade. In the near term,
the authorities will need to deal with significant levels of debt service, including repurchases
to the Fund. Consideration should be given to financing payments to the Fund directly from
international reserves in a manner that does not weaken the financial position of the central
bank. Under these conditions, and provided the assumed fiscal effort and market access were
achieved, there would be financing surpluses, indicating that Argentina’s capacity to pay is
higher than the projected debt obligations. Staff acknowledges that the use of reserves would
require a decision at the highest political level, and would need to be made without impairing
the autonomy of the central bank.
66.
On the exchange restriction subject to Fund approval under Article VIII, given
the timeframe for its removal, staff recommends the Executive Board approve the exchange
restriction arising from a freeze on reprogrammed deposits (the corralón) until September
30, 2005 (a proposed decision is contained in Section X).
67.
Finally, Argentina’s sharp recovery from the crisis signals its potential to rebuild
sustainable medium-term growth and entrench growing prosperity. The staff is
convinced that, with a strong policy framework, Argentina will be able to attract the
necessary domestic and foreign resources that will be needed to make this a reality.
68.
The next Article IV consultation will take place in accordance with the July 15,
2002 decision on consultation cycles.

ANNEX I

DEBT SUSTAINABILITY ANALYSIS (DSA)
A. Authorities’ Scenario (Scenario A)
1.
During the Article IV consultation, staff had an intensive discussion with the
authorities on debt sustainability. The authorities presented staff with a scenario that was
based on the following assumptions:
•

Macroeconomic framework: (i) Real growth declines from above 6 percent in 2005
to 3 percent in the medium term; (ii) average inflation falls from 7¾ percent in the
near term to 3 percent in the medium term; (iii) the real peso-dollar exchange rate
gradually appreciates over time but remains more than 40 percent below its 2001
level; and (iv) interest rates on new dollar borrowing remain constant at 9 percent.

•

Coverage: Only the federal government is covered. While not explicit in the
authorities’ model, it is assumed that the provincial governments make net transfers
to the federal government (“recoveries”) on account on debt service payments made
on behalf of the provincial governments.

•

Official debt: The international financial institutions (IFIs), including the Fund,
maintain their exposure at current levels until 2014.1 After 2014, 80 percent of
principal obligations to the Fund are rolled over through 2030, when credit Fund
exposure remains at US$8 billion. The exposure of other multilateral creditors also
declines gradually as 80 percent of principal amortizations are rolled over starting
from 2015. With regard to bilateral debt, the authorities’ model assumes forgiveness
of interest arrears and a stock rescheduling of the principal claims, involving a tenyear principal grace period starting from mid-2005 and ten-year repayment period.
The interest rate on rescheduled claims is Libor plus 250 basis points, with interest
capitalized during the first two years.2

The authorities assume stand-by arrangements from 2005 until 2011 and extended arrangements afterwards.

The authorities indicated that this working assumption should not be construed as their negotiating position
toward Paris Club creditors.

ANNEX I

Fiscal effort: The federal primary surplus
that is available for debt service
(appropriable primary surplus) is 2¾ percent
in the near term and 2 percent in the long
term. The primary surplus under the
program definition is higher by the fiscal
savings accumulated by the social security
and other fiscal entities.

25

20

15

Financing sources: In 2005, the scenario
includes a drawdown of accumulated
government deposits of US$1 billion. Any
residual financing need is financed through
the issuance of a generic ten-year U.S. dollar
denominated bullet bond paying the market
interest rate, assumed at 9 percent.

While starting from high levels, the
federal debt stock would decline
rapidly. The debt-to-GDP ratio would fall
from 79 percent of GDP at end-2005 to 60
percent by 2010 and 30 percent by 2030,
when the newly issued debt represents
⅔ of outstanding debt.

official creditors and post-crisis
performing debt. When debt service obligations on the restructured debt pick up
toward the end of the projection period, as coupon rates rise and amortizations begin,
overall debt service obligations would average about 5 percent of GDP.

•

Accordingly, Argentina would need to place significant amounts of debt on the
private capital markets. After the assumed full rollover of principal repayments to

- 52 -

ANNEX I

IFIs, new market borrowing would average 1¾ percent of GDP from 2005–2008 (or
US$3.2 billion).
B. Staff Assessment of Authorities’ Scenario (Scenario B)
3.
The staff argued that the authorities’ scenario was based on several unrealistic
assumptions. An alternative scenario based on current policies was therefore developed, in
which the absence of a structural reform policy
12
12
framework results in a weaker macroeconomic

outlook. Under this scenario, sluggish

to lift the real exchange rate above current levels.

In addition, the authorities’ fiscal scenario is
retained, while inflation averages 10 percent in

the medium term. These adverse developments
justify a higher interest rate on new market
2

borrowing (by 100 basis points). Finally, the
unrealistic assumption of full rollover of Fund
0
0
resources was dropped and no Fund
2005 2010 2015 2020 2025 2030
disbursements were assumed in this scenario.
4.
The results of such a no-reform
scenario show a significantly higher debt-toGDP ratio and a substantial need to borrow
in the private market (Annex Table 2). The
debt ratio would not converge onto a clear
downward path and debt placements would be
almost 3½ percent of GDP in 2005 and remain
on average at around this level until 2010.
5.
It is unlikely that private sources
could be mobilized to meet these borrowing
needs. Rollover rates on privately held debt
would need to be as high as 129 percent in 2005
and average 150 percent in 2006–15.

C. Staff Scenario with Reforms (Scenario C)
6.
The staff developed its own scenario based on the assumption of proactive
reforms, which would underpin higher growth, lower inflation and lower borrowing
costs than in scenario B. The main assumptions in this scenario are as follows:
•

Official debt: No further Fund disbursements under the current or future
arrangements are assumed, implying that Fund exposure would be reduced to zero by

- 53 -

ANNEX I

2009. A flow rescheduling of bilateral claims under classic terms is assumed to take
place at end-2005.
•

Fiscal effort: Active policies are assumed whereby the financial transaction and
export taxes are gradually phased out starting in 2006 and compensatory measures are
adopted to offset revenue losses. This active tax reform scenario, combined with
prudent expenditure policies, results in a primary surplus that averages at least 4½
percent of GDP from 2005–07, 3½ percent from 2008–15 and stabilizes at 2¾ percent
in outer years. Provincial governments are assumed to generate primary surpluses that
are sufficient to cover provincial debt service obligations on the debt restructured in
2002, debt issued to withdraw quasi-monies, and non-intergovernmental debt.

7.
The results of the staff scenario indicate that the debt burden converges
gradually towards sustainable levels but market financing needs would still remain high
(Annex Table 3):
•

•

Debt-to-GDP ratio: The debt-to-GDP
ratio would decline at a faster pace
than under the authorities’ scenario,
owing to the higher fiscal effort,
although the need to replace official
sources with more costly private
sources would partially dampen the
debt-reducing effect of higher
surpluses. The debt ratio would fall to
60 percent in 2009, one year earlier
than in the authorities’ scenario, and
would be 11 percentage points lower at
the end of the projection period.

Reliance on private capital markets: Despite the higher fiscal effort, the market
financing requirements would be even higher by almost 1 percent of GDP from
2005–08 under the staff scenario than in the authorities’ scenario (A), with additional
market borrowing averaging almost US$2 billion. The rollover rate would remain in
the near term at an average of 109 percent from 2005–08, compared to 68 percent
under the authorities’ scenario.
D. Staff Scenario with Use of Central Bank Credit (Scenario D)

8.
The staff scenario was modified to allow for the use of central bank credit to
meet net amortizations to the Fund. It was assumed that the current limits on central bank

- 54 -

ANNEX I

lending to the government are relaxed to allow for payments to the Fund from international
reserves.3
9.
The reduction in the required market borrowing would be substantial and
therefore reduce rollover risk significantly (Annex Table 4). Under this scenario, market
borrowing would be about ¾ percent of GDP or 1¾ percentage points of GDP lower than in
the staff’s baseline scenario (C), reducing the required rollover rates to an average of only 34
percent in the near term.
E. Sensitivity
10.
The debt dynamics of the staff’s scenario (C) are highly sensitive to the
underlying macroeconomic assumptions.
•

In the near term, short-lived but large shocks to output growth or the exchange rate,
or fiscal policy slippages, have the potential to generate significant increases in the
debt-to-GDP ratio (Annex Table 5). The average long maturity of the debt structure
should provide cushion against real interest rate shocks.

•

In the long term, maintaining growth is key to
100
debt sustainability both directly and indirectly
Baseline
(by reducing the risk of exchange rate and
Combined
1 percent higher interest rate
80
interest rate shocks). Compared to the baseline
10 percent weaker currency
1 percent lower growth
scenario, (i) a permanent increase in interest
60
rates by one percentage point would increase
the 2030 debt ratio by 5 percentage points;
(ii) a permanent 1 percentage point reduction
40
in the growth rate from 2006 would increase
the 2030 debt ratio by 17 percentage points;
20
and (iii) a 10 percentage point more
depreciated level for the real exchange rate
0
from 2006 would raise the 2030 debt ratio by
2005
2010
2015
2020
2025
8 percentage points. If combined, the above
mentioned shocks would lead to unsustainable
debt dynamics, with the debt ratio falling only very gradually until 2015 and
remaining at high levels afterwards. Conversely, a higher than projected real
appreciation would reinforce the downward trend in the debt-to-GDP ratio, with a
10 percent more appreciated exchange rate reducing the debt ratio by 8 percentage
points by 2030.

The illustrative assumption made by staff in the quantitative projections is that the BCRA will receive longterm bonds (with a five-year grace period on principal and a 15-year amortization period), which carry a market
interest rate.

- 55 -

•

ANNEX I

A one-time increase in the debt stock of 10 percent of GDP, for example from
liabilities in the banking and utility sectors, would not generate explosive dynamics.
However, it would significantly delay the transition towards sustainable levels of
indebtedness.

11.
The debt dynamics in the near
term are robust to alternative
assumptions on the terms of the new
market borrowing, with alternative
assumptions affecting mostly the outer years
of the projection period (2016–30). An
assumption of gradually declining spreads4
would only reduce the debt-to-GDP ratio by
1½ percentage points by 2030 compared to
the staff scenario C. The use of bonds with a
shorter grace period (five years) but a longer
amortization period (15 years) for new
borrowing would raise average
amortizations by 0.1 percent of GDP in
2009–2015 yet reduce them by ⅓ percent of
GDP in the outer years of the projection
period, without affecting the debt stock.

12.
The burden of the debt service is somewhat less in net-present-value terms than
that suggested by the headline ratios of the DSA scenarios. Long maturities and belowmarket interest rates on a large part of the debt imply that the average carrying cost (on a
cash basis) rises gradually from rather low levels. As a result, for discount rates between 8
and 12 percent, the net present value of the outstanding debt service obligations at end-2005
is lower than the face value of debt by between
Debt Stock at End-2005 (in percent of GDP)
8 to 23 percentage points of GDP. The largest
relief is afforded by the restructured debt, although

This exercise assumes spreads over US government bonds that decline from 490 basis points in 2005 to 400 in
2015 and 150 points by the end of the projection period (corresponding to interest rates of 8.4 percent and
6.4 percent, respectively).

1/ Federal government debt (excludes public deposits). Based on staff scenario C.
2/ Derived as [(r - π(1+g) - g + αε(1+r)]/(1+g+π+gπ)) times previous period debt ratio, with r = interest rate; π = growth rate of GDP deflator; g = real GDP growth rate; α = share of foreign-currency
denominated debt; and ε = nominal exchange rate depreciation (measured by increase in local currency value of U.S. dollar).
3/ The real interest rate contribution is derived from the numerator in footnote 2/ as r - π (1+g) and the real growth contribution as -g.
4/ The exchange rate contribution is derived from the numerator in footnote 2/ as αε(1+r).
5/ Includes recoveries and non-appropriable surpluses. In 2002, it reflects the pesification of Phase 1 debt; in 2005, the restructuring of Phase 2 debt.
6/ Derived as nominal interest expenditure divided by previous period debt stock. Historical values include interest capitalization and inflation adjustment).
7/ The key variables include real GDP growth; real interest rate; and primary balance in percent of GDP.
8/ Real depreciation is defined as nominal depreciation (measured by percentage fall in dollar value of local currency) minus domestic inflation (based on GDP deflator).

1. Key variables are at their historical averages in 2006-10 7/
2. Real interest rate is at historical average plus two standard deviations in 2006 and 2007
3. Real GDP growth is at historical average minus two standard deviations in 2006 and 2007
4. Primary balance is at historical average minus two standard deviations in 2006 and 2007
5. Combination of 2-4 using one standard deviation shocks
6. One time 30 percent real depreciation in 2006 8/
7. 10 percent of GDP increase in other debt-creating flows in 2006

Alternative Scenarios

Real GDP growth (in percent)
Average nominal interest rate on public debt (in percent) 6/
Average real interest rate (nominal rate minus change in GDP deflator, in percent)
Inflation rate (GDP deflator, in percent)

Safeguards Assessments: The Central Bank of Argentina (BCRA) is subject to a
safeguards assessment under the current Stand-By Arrangement. An on-site
assessment of the BCRA was conducted in December 2003. The priority
recommendations of this assessment were: (i) the publication of audited annual
financial statements prepared on the basis of International Financial Reporting
Standards (IFRS); and (ii) a strengthening of existing control procedures to ensure
that all monetary data reported to the Fund under the program reflect the
definitions contained in the TMU. While the latter recommendation has been
implemented, the publication of the IFRS-based financial statements will not take
place until local accounting standards have been harmonized with IFRS.
C. Nonfinancial Relations

VIII. Exchange rate: On March 27, 1991, a law was passed guaranteeing the full
convertibility of the austral under a currency board arrangement and pegging the
austral at A
= 10,000 per U.S. dollar. On January l, l992 the peso was substituted for
the austral at a rate of l peso per 10,000 australes. On January 7, 2002, the
currency board arrangement was abandoned in favor of a dual exchange rate
regime with an official rate of Arg$1.4 per U.S. dollar for most trade, trade
finance, and public sector transactions; remaining transactions were at a market
floating rate. On February 11, 2002, the dual exchange rate regime was abolished
and substituted by a floating regime with no pre-announced rate of the exchange
rate.
Argentina accepted the obligations of Article VIII, Section 2(a), 3 and 4 in 1968.
The Executive Board temporarily approved, until this Article IV consultation, an
exchange restriction arising from the freezing of deposits pursuant to the corralón.
Staff recommends continued approval of this exchange restriction until
September 30, 2005. Staff is not aware of any other exchange restrictions.

RELATIONS WITH THE WORLD BANK GROUP1
1.
The total current Bank portfolio in Argentina is composed of 33 loans totaling
US$5.4 billion in commitments. Twenty-eight loans correspond to investment projects—
or some 64 percent of total lending in dollar terms—amounting to US$3.4 billion in
commitments, of which US$0.9 billion remain undisbursed. The remaining five are
adjustment operations totaling US$1.95 billion in commitments, of which US$876
million remain undisbursed. The Bank’s exposure to Argentina as of April 30, 2005
stands at US$7.2 billion.
2.
The last Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) Report was discussed at the Board
on April 15, 2004. The CAS, which covers the period April 2004 to December 2005,
provides US$2 billion in support of country efforts to achieve sustained economic growth
with equity, social inclusion, and improved governance, and includes financing from
IBRD and IFC.
3.
The Bank has moved forward with an active investment program to aid in the
consolidation of the strong recovery underway in Argentina. About 77 percent of these
projects in CY 2004–05 have been in support of infrastructure and social investments. In
December and June of 2004 respectively, the Bank’s Board approved a National Highway
Asset Management Project for US$200 million and a US$200 million loan for infrastructure
development in Buenos Aires Province, the country’s largest and most economically
important area. Disbursements in 2004 amounted to US$770 million, including US$620 in
investment operations; US$150 million was disbursed in adjustment lending. In April 2005,
the Bank’s Board approved US$130 million for flood protection works in the city of Buenos
Aires.
4.
The Bank and the Government have made considerable strides in their joint effort to
improve performance of the Bank’s investment portfolio, with problem projects cut by more
than half since the crisis in 2002–03. Today, some 25 percent of Bank investment projects
are rated as unsatisfactory for implementation progress, compared with 48 percent in 2004.
5.
A new Country Assistance Strategy is expected to be presented to the Board in
December 2005.

ANNEX IV

RELATIONS WITH THE INTER-AMERICAN DEVELOPMENT BANK1
Country strategy and lending program
1.
In November 2004, the Bank approved a new Country Strategy for Argentina for the
period 2004–08. The strategy general objective is to support the Government’s initiatives for
promoting a more equitable and sustainable growth. To that end, the strategy focuses on three
areas: (i) institutional strengthening for better governance and fiscal sustainability;
(ii) improving the climate for investment and productivity growth, to enhance the country’s
competitiveness; and (iii) promotion of sustainable and inclusive social development.
Preparation of the strategy drew from the results of a series of internal workshops, sector
specific studies and self-assessment, and a consultation workshop with the government,
private sector and civil society in February 2004.
2.
The Country Strategy sets forth a target lending scenario of US$5.0 billion for the
period 2004–08, that involves a higher concentration of new lending in investment loans to
better reflect the transition of the country towards policies and programs with medium and
long term objectives. The proposed target scenario entails neutral loan flows between the
country and the Bank over the period of the Strategy, provided that efforts to improve project
execution are strengthened and sustained in the years ahead.
3.
Achieving this target scenario would demand a deepening of the reform program and
definition of sector strategies; a significant improvement in the implementation of projects in
execution and based on these elements, development of a lending pipeline with well defined
development objectives. In 2004, the Bank approved four operations for a total amount of
US$527,6 million. For the next 12 months, the lending program with the public sector totals
US$1.9 billion, with nine investment operations accounting for 84 percent of this amount.
Portfolio
4.
As of April 30, 2005, the Bank portfolio in Argentina consists of 43 projects totaling
US$5.5 billion of which US$2.6 billion remain undisbursed. By area of activity outlined in
the Country Strategy, 59 percent of approved balances are directed to poverty reduction and
social inclusion, 26 percent to productivity and competitiveness, and 15 percent to improve
governance and fiscal sustainability.
5.
In response to the crisis, the Bank adjusted its activities in Argentina in 2002 and
2003 to better respond to a new economic, social and political context. In particular it
tightened supervision of its portfolio to take into account harsher fiscal constraints;
reformulated its social and productive sector portfolios in order to better respond to the
Government’s priorities as well as to improve portfolio performance; and early in 2003 the
1

- 68 -

ANNEX IV

second tranche of two sector loans were reformulated. Actions plans set to improve project
performance allowed the Bank and the authorities to closely follow progress and to introduce
corrective measures as needed to stay on track. As a result of these initiatives, the percentage
of undisbursed balances related to projects with unsatisfactory performance has dropped
from 49.0 percent in December 2003, to 0.2 percent by April 2005.
6.
IDB disbursements for 2004 totaled US$341.0 million. As the country moves away
from crisis management to a medium-term development agenda, disbursements from the
investment loan portfolio are expected to surpass their late-1990s levels of around
US$500 million per year, based on a framework of fiscal sustainability and increasing
Government capacity to execute investment programs.

ARGENTINA
Staff Report for the 2005 Article IV Consultation
Supplementary Information
Prepared by Staff Representative for the 2005 Consultation with Argentina
(in consultation with other Departments)
Approved by John Dodsworth and G. Russell Kincaid
June 17, 2005
1.
The following information on recent developments and policy implementation has
become available since the circulation of the staff paper on the Article IV consultation on
May 31, 2005. The thrust of the staff appraisal remains unchanged.
I. RECENT DEVELOPMENTS AND INDICATORS
2.
Recent data show continued economic growth and favorable financial
conditions, but with inflationary pressures emerging.
•

Economic activity rose in the first quarter of 2005, somewhat more slowly
than expected. Real GDP increased only 0.5 percent from the previous quarter on
a seasonally adjusted basis, but was still up 8 percent year-on-year. The outcome
remains consistent with staff’s projection of 6–7 percent growth for real GDP in
2005.

•

Consumer prices increased by 0.6 percent in May, raising inflation in the
first five months of the year to 5.2 percent.

•

Gross international reserves rose to US$22.4 billion, well surpassing the endyear forecast of US$20.7 billion in the staff report. The central bank president
stated that gross international reserves could rise to US$24 billion by end-2005.

•

The settlement of the debt exchange was concluded on June 10 and Standard
& Poor’s assigned a B- rating to the new bonds. As a result, the country risk
premium declined and the new bonds currently trade at a spread of 500–600bps
over U.S.-Treasuries.

-2-

II. POLICY IMPLEMENTATION
3.
The following developments have taken place with respect to policy
implementation.
•

Central bank intervention in the foreign exchange market remained heavy.
Purchases in the first two weeks of June amounted to over US$ 0.6 billion,
bringing total intervention to over US$2.1 billion since end-April. Interest rates
on central bank Lebacs have increased slightly since mid-May and base money
remains close to the upper bound of the authorities’ monetary program.

•

Fiscal performance at the federal government level remained strong through
May. In the first five months of the year, the federal cash primary surplus reached
Arg$9.8 billion (1.9 percent of annual GDP), exceeding the authorities’
projections by about 0.7 percent of annual GDP. This overperformance was due
to both higher-than-projected revenue and somewhat lower-than-projected
expenditure. In the first quarter, the consolidated primary surplus reached
Arg$6.3 billion (1.2 percent of GDP). The provinces performed strongly,
contributing 0.4 percent of GDP to the surplus.

•

The government announced a 16 percent increase in the minimum pension.
Despite assurances during the consultation that no additional spending initiatives
would be taken, the minimum pension was raised by Arg$48 to Arg$350 per
month, effective June 1. The authorities estimate an annual cost of the measure of
0.3 percent of GDP.

•

The minimum wage was increased from Arg$450 to Arg$630 per month. The
increase, to be phased in through July, mainly regularized previously decreed
non-remunerative bonuses that are now incorporated in the basic minimum salary.
It will benefit an estimated 900,000 workers in the private sector and 130,000 in
the public sector. Preliminary estimates indicate that the net impact of this
measure on the federal budget is almost neutral, but there will be some additional
burden for provincial governments.

•

Congress approved a tax administration law which increases the powers of the
tax administration to conduct inspections and seize goods, allows the issuance of
communications to taxpayers in electronic form, and raises penalties for tax
irregularities. This law is one of several components of the second anti-evasion
package, the submission of which was a structural benchmark for end-March
2004 under the current stand-by arrangement.

•

The government introduced a 30 percent non-remunerated reserve
requirement on capital inflows. The measure, intended to prevent an
appreciation of the exchange rate, is primarily aimed at reducing foreign
purchases of government paper and equities in the secondary market. Current

-3-

account transactions, foreign direct investments, and primary issuances of bonds
and shares are excluded. This new control follows an extension of the minimum
stay of capital inflows from 180 to 365 days in late May. Stock market
representatives have argued that the measures will segment the financial market
and be detrimental to the deepening of domestic financial instruments. Staff is
doubtful whether the new measures will effectively achieve their intended
objective and concerned that the controls may raise the cost of government
financing.
•

Staff has learned that an earlier central bank regulation has effectively
weakened the targeted reduction in bank exposure to the public sector this
year. While banks were expected to meet a 40 percent limit by end-2005, the
regulation excludes from this limit government securities maturing up to six
months ahead.

•

New public services contracts were agreed with 5 privatized companies
(mainly in electricity transmission), raising the total number of renegotiated
agreements to 19 (Table 1). Congress has so far approved 8 of these agreements,
although their implementation by the executive is still pending. The new
agreements do not fundamentally change the staff’s assessment on progress in this
area, since they cover companies with a relatively low volume of sales and the
contracts do not establish a path for tariff adjustments beyond 2005.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

International Monetary Fund

Washington, D. C. 20431 USA

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2005 Article IV Consultation with
Argentina
On June 20, 2005, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded the
Article IV consultation with Argentina.1
Background
Argentina’s economy has rebounded strongly from the financial crisis in late 2001. Reflecting
buoyant domestic demand, real GDP grew close to 9 percent in both 2003 and 2004 bringing
real output level back to the peak level achieved prior to the crisis. From early 2003, confidence
rose steadily, and both private consumption and investment rebounded. Export receipts have
increased—initially reflecting higher commodity prices—and imports remain below pre-crisis
levels. International reserves have recovered, and bank deposit and external payments
restrictions have been progressively dismantled.
The robust resurgence in money demand was a key aspect of the recovery. Inflation—after
spiking in 2002—remained moderate (reaching only 3¾ percent in 2003 and 6 percent in 2004)
despite the almost 300 percent depreciation of the currency. Given the softness of labor
markets and a freeze on public service prices, real wages recovered only slowly and the real
exchange rate remains somewhat depreciated.
Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members. A staff team collects economic and financial information, and discusses with
officials the country's economic developments and policies. The staff then prepares a report,
which forms the basis for discussion by the Executive Board. At the conclusion of the
discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the Board, summarizes the views of
Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the country's authorities.
1

-2-

Fiscal performance was strong in 2003 and 2004, mainly as a result of improvements in tax
administration and robust economic activity. The consolidated primary surplus reached
3.0 percent and 5.1 percent of GDP in 2003 and 2004, respectively, as total revenues rose
from 23 percent of GDP in 2002 to 29 percent of GDP in 2004. The strengthening of tax
administration and strong VAT and income tax collection were important factors behind the
fiscal performance, but distortive taxes (export and financial transactions taxes) also account
for close to 20 percent of total revenues. Social and capital spending accelerated towards the
end of 2004, resulting in end-year expenditures exceeding original budget targets by
considerable margins.
Social indicators began to improve from end-2002 at a steady, but gradual pace. The headline
unemployment rate fell to about 13 percent in March 2005 from 17.8 percent in December
2002, although an additional 4.1 percent of the labor force is employed under emergency social
assistance programs. The share of the population living in extreme poverty fell to 17 percent in
June 2004 (from 24.8 percent two years earlier) and the share of the population below the
poverty line declined from a peak of 58 percent to 44 percent in June 2004.
During the first part of 2005, economic conditions have remained generally favorable. Growth
has continued in the first quarter (at 8 percent year-on-year) and consumer and business
confidence indicators remain at high levels. Inflation, however, has accelerated amid rising
demand, increased capacity constraints, growing wage pressures and monetary
accommodation; consumer prices rose by 5.2 percent during the first five months of 2005,
bringing the 12-month inflation rate to 8.6 percent. A strong trade balance and a significant
reduction in private capital outflows have facilitated a sharp rise in international reserves to over
US$22 billion.
The approved budget for 2005 aims for a consolidated primary surplus of 3.8 percent of GDP
on a cash basis. During the first five months of 2005, the federal government achieved a
primary surplus of 1.9 percent of annual GDP.
Monetary policy has moved toward a tightening phase. Since January 2005, the central bank
increased its policy interest rates on three occasions by a total of 125 basis points, bringing the
repo rate to 3.75 percent, and has increased steadily the interest rates it pays on short-term
Lebacs. However, renewed foreign exchange interventions since April have contributed to an
acceleration in base money.
Argentina’s global debt exchange offer was launched in January 2005 and closed on February
25 with a 76 percent participation level. As a result of the debt restructuring, Argentina’s debt
burden has declined to 72 percent of GDP (from 147 percent of GDP in 2002) and the debt
service profile has improved considerably. Nonetheless, approximately US$20 billion in
principal in default remains outstanding. The settlement of the debt exchange was completed
on June 2 due to a delay resulting from legal action by some nonparticipating creditors to attach
the tendered bonds.

-3-

Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors noted that Argentina is emerging from a difficult period in its history,
and has made a strong recovery from the 2001 financial crisis. Directors recognized, however,
that, while much has been accomplished, many challenges lie ahead. They noted that the
current growth momentum and accompanying political stability provide a critical window of
opportunity for the government to leave the crisis behind and undertake the policies—
committed to in 2003 under the current stand-by arrangement—that would ensure long-lasting
and equitable growth.
Directors emphasized that, for the recovery to be sustained, the authorities need to take action
on a number of fronts: to continue with responsible macroeconomic policies, guarding
particularly against inflation; to undertake structural reforms that will boost factor productivity
and raise potential growth above its historic rate; to strengthen the financial system and revive
intermediation; to normalize relations with creditors; and to ensure that the fruits of growth are
equitably shared and that the still vulnerable sections of the community are adequately
protected.
Directors noted that prudent macroeconomic policies in 2003–04 have provided an anchor for
the recovery of confidence. They commended the authorities for their steadfast implementation
of fiscal policy, which produced record levels of primary surplus and demonstrated the potential
for Argentina to move away from its high level of national indebtedness. Directors congratulated
the authorities on achieving two years of low inflation, which was key to the recovery process.
Monetary policy has taken advantage of resurging demand for pesos to rebuild international
reserves while keeping both interest rates and inflation low.
Directors noted, however, that the macroeconomic policy stance could weaken in 2005 relative
to 2004, at a time when the output gap is closing and inflationary pressures are mounting. They
urged the authorities to tighten both fiscal and monetary policies to contain inflation. They also
cautioned that the authorities’ efforts to apply moral suasion and administrative measures to
stabilize prices are unlikely to be effective and could have adverse consequences on the
investment climate.
Directors noted that the primary surplus target of 3.8 percent of GDP in the 2005 budget
represents a sizeable injection of fiscal stimulus, but welcomed indications that the target might
be exceeded again this year. They urged the authorities to put in place measures to ensure the
achievement of a higher primary surplus, preferably closer to the level achieved in 2004,
particularly in the event that revenues are higher than expected. While recognizing that the
government has over-performed its primary fiscal surplus target during the first five months of
2005, Directors noted that further fiscal consolidation is needed to avoid a budgetary financing
gap from arising in the second half of 2005, and emphasized the need to maintain tight
expenditure for the rest of the year.
Directors welcomed the authorities’ recent efforts to raise interest rates, but believed that
additional tightening would be desirable. They recommended that base money be brought to
the lower end of the authorities’ target range, which could require reduced foreign exchange
intervention and a further rise in interest rates. A number of Directors also cautioned against

-4-

the inflationary risks of using monetary policy to pursue exchange rate stability, and
recommended that the authorities clarify their commitment to price stability as the prime
objective of monetary policy, while a few Directors stressed that the central bank needs to have
the necessary operational autonomy to effectively combat inflation. In this context, most
Directors called for a greater degree of nominal exchange rate flexibility, while noting that the
government’s foreign exchange market intervention policy should be transparent, and stressing
that competitiveness is best achieved through structural reforms and prudent macroeconomic
policies. A few Directors also cautioned against the use of capital controls as a means to resist
upward pressures on the exchange rate.
Directors called for the steadfast implementation of key structural reforms committed to by the
government under the Fund-supported program. They urged the authorities to take advantage
of the current favorable situation to implement structural measures that had been committed to
under the current stand-by arrangement. A few Directors also noted the importance of strong
ownership and careful sequencing of such reforms.
Directors noted, in particular, that structural fiscal reforms are crucial to sustain strong
budgetary performance and enhance growth prospects over the medium term.
They commended the authorities for the progress in restoring fiscal prudence and restraining
overspending by the provinces. Nevertheless, most Directors underscored the importance of
strengthening the institutional fiscal framework, including the Fiscal Responsibility Law, while
acknowledging the political constraints facing the authorities. A few Directors also called for the
establishment of clear rules to reinforce the role of the Federal Council for Fiscal Responsibility.
They called for more binding constraints on provincial spending and borrowing, less discretion
of federal financing to provinces, better coordination of fiscal policies across levels of
government, increased budgetary transparency and consistent accounting standards at the
provincial level, and more equitable and stable intra-governmental revenue sharing. In that
context, a few Directors highlighted the constitutional difficulties faced by the authorities in
advancing the recommended structural and fiscal reforms. Directors called for a phasing-out of
distortionary taxes on exports and financial transactions, and a few emphasized that this
measure should be revenue neutral and that it should not increase the share of revenues to the
provinces at the expense of those of the central government.
Directors welcomed the progress in implementing the banking sector recovery strategy
developed in 2003. They commended the authorities for maintaining the supervisory and
regulatory framework under very difficult circumstances, while noting that considerable
temporary regulatory forbearance has been extended. Directors emphasized, however, that the
banking system remains vulnerable and undercapitalized relative to international standards,
and that several issues remain pending, in particular with regard to the compensation for policyinduced losses and the judicial clarification of losses from amparos. Directors stressed the
need to ensure that prudential standards are applied strictly, including the announced
regulatory phase-in of market valuation of government bonds and limits to bank exposure to the
public sector. At the same time, Directors recommended that incentives for early
recapitalization of banks be strengthened. They also noted the expanding role of public banks
and urged the authorities to articulate a strategy which would clarify the role of the public sector
in the banking system going forward.

-5-

Directors observed that the situation in the regulated utilities sector is not sustainable, and that
failure to resolve outstanding issues would have damaging consequences for macroeconomic
stability, the investment climate, and future growth. Directors urged the authorities to quickly
reach collaborative long-term agreements with the utility concessionaires that would ensure an
appropriate economic return and adequate future investment in the sectors, as committed to in
the current Fund-supported program. Directors also stressed the importance of putting in place,
at an early date, an updated regulatory framework that would provide regulatory certainty and
find an appropriate balance between protection of consumers and provision of necessary
investment incentives.
Directors viewed the recently completed debt exchange as an important step toward
normalization of relations with creditors. They stressed that for Argentina to emerge fully from
the financial crisis and regain access to capital markets, the authorities need to develop a
forward-looking strategy to resolve remaining arrears outstanding to private creditors consistent
with the Fund’s Lending into Arrears policy. Directors also noted the need to normalize relations
with bilateral official creditors through a Paris Club agreement, and to maintain regularized
relations with the European Investment Bank.
Directors emphasized that debt sustainability for Argentina will require a steadfast
implementation of fiscal and structural policies. They noted that only under a proactive reform
scenario, including a high and sustained fiscal effort, would the debt-to-GDP ratio return to
more comfortable levels over the medium term and allow an early exit from the use of Fund
resources.
Most Directors considered appropriate that the authorities should have the flexibility to draw on
their international reserves to finance the significant levels of debt service, including
repurchases to the Fund, that fall due in the near term, while some Directors raised questions
regarding the use of international reserves for this purpose. They noted that it would be
important for the use of reserves to be made in a manner that does not impair the financial
soundness or autonomy of the central bank.
The Executive Board also discussed the issue of arrears to the European Investment Bank
(EIB) which arose in 2003 and caused nonobservance of continuous performance criteria under
the standby arrangements of January 2003 and September 2003. The misreporting of these
arrears gave rise to five noncomplying purchases, and breaches of obligation under Article VIII,
Section 5 of the Fund’s Articles of Agreement. On December 10, 2004 Argentina cleared these
arrears to the EIB. On the basis of this corrective measure, the Executive Board granted
waivers of the nonobservances of the performance criteria underlying the misreporting and
agreed that no further remedial action was warranted with respect to the breaches of Article
VIII, Section 5.
Public Information Notices (PINs) are issued, (i) at the request of a member country, following the
conclusion of the Article IV consultation for countries seeking to make known the views of the IMF to the
public. This action is intended to strengthen IMF surveillance over the economic policies of member
countries by increasing the transparency of the IMF's assessment of these policies; and (ii) following polic
discussions in the Executive Board at the decision of the Board.

Statement by Hector Torres, Executive Director for Argentina
June 20, 2005

1. My authorities are grateful to the staff and management for the comprehensive and
detailed discussions on the recent developments and outlook for the Argentine
economy. They expect that this Art. IV Consultation will help to find a common
ground on which constructive negotiations on a new Stand-By Arrangement could be
soon started.
2. Before addressing some specific points of the staff report, it is worthwhile to consider
where the Argentine economy stands today vis-à-vis the peak of the crisis in April
2002. In the first place, during these three years real GDP grew by 28 percent with
industrial production increasing 50 percent, which points to the re-industrialization
process Argentina is undergoing. All demand components have contributed to this
exceptional performance. The revamping of consumption played an important role in
the wake of a strong recuperation of employment and a gradual increase in real
wages. Today, GDP stands at a level similar to the record reached in the second
semester of 1998.
3. Another key variable has been investment, which, at 21 percent of GDP in current
prices, has reached a historical record in the fourth quarter of 2004. In the external
front, exports are also at a historical record growing at 20 percent annual rate while
industrial goods exports are showing an annual growth rate of 43 percent. The whole
process of strengthened economic activity has taken place while the fiscal front was
subjected to a sharp and unprecedented adjustment with a consolidated primary
surplus reaching over 5 percent of GDP in 2004. Inflation, in turn, has been subdue
and, even after the recent spur, it is still within the band projected for this year. The
exchange rate is at a competitive level and the business and banking community has
welcomed the government policy of avoiding sharp nominal movements. Finally,
and as a result of all these policies, 2.5 million new jobs have been created during this
period, more than 80 percent of which were created by the private sector, in particular
by small- and medium-size enterprises. This has led, in turn, to a substantial
reduction in poverty, which is nonetheless hovering the 40 percent level, thus
signaling the magnitude of the job that still lies ahead.
4. Having stated these facts and before addressing the policy issues, I would like to raise
some specific points on the report. The staff report alludes several times to the need
to transform the recovery into sustainable growth and poverty reduction in the
medium-term. Whereas we fully agree with these goals, it is important to highlight
that the aforementioned “recovery”, that took place in a context of lack of external
financing, substantial net repayments to the IFIs and a significant build up in
international reserves, has already proven to be more than just a “recovery”. Indeed,
from the “Indian summer” of the second half of 2002 until today, skeptical pundits
have abounded and a few have even dared to call it “a dead-cat jump”. However,
facts indicate that within twelve consecutive quarters of record fiscal performance,

-2both at the central government and provincial government level, Argentina has
featured exceptional growth rates and has reached already the peak level of real
growth observed during the 90’s, at a time, it is only fair to remember, when the
economy was artificially sustained by external flows. In short, the dead-cat has
jumped at his highest level ever and remains comfortably there and we do not believe
this is a miracle or just the result of the influence of external positive factors. It is
possibly the best indicator that the government has been doing things well despite the
staff’s lack of understanding for the government’s policy actions and difficulties in
fully accomplishing some of the structural reforms envisaged in the latest
arrangement with the Fund.
5. In this regard, it is important to recall that the starting date of the recovery in
confidence and growth was mid-2002 and not early 2003, as mentioned in paragraph
3 of the report. Thus we are finishing the third year of continued expansion. In
addition, paragraph 4 makes a fair description of the diverse factors that supported
such an expansion including political stability and sound macroeconomic policies. It
also adds the favorable external environment as reflected by the improvement in the
terms of trade and the robust economic activity in Brazil, one of Argentina’s main
trading partner. Regarding the improvement in the terms of trade, this has been the
case only during 2003, since during 2004 this impact has been slightly negative rather
than positive and the projected impact for the current year is substantially negative.
As to the impact of Brazil’s growth, the facts are that only during 2004 growth has
picked up in Brazil while Argentina has been growing, as we have said, since mid2002. Moreover, Argentina is holding a significant trade deficit with Brazil which in
terms of macroeconomic consequences means that Argentina’s high growth is
contributing to that of Brazil.
6. In the same vein, I would like to take issue with the assertion contained in the heading
of paragraph 6. It is there stated that the “recovery” has also been helped by “net
financial support from the international community”. This is a seriously misleading
assertion. Of course, while Argentina remained in default private creditors were
forced by the circumstances to provide net financial support to Argentina and the
same could be said as regards bilateral creditors. However, multilateral creditors have
quite a different story to tell. As stated above, the sustained expansion of economic
activity in Argentina took place while substantial net repayments to the IFIs was
being done. These net repayments started from the beginning of the crisis and not
just after the “failure to complete the third review of the three-year Stand-By
Arrangement” in mid-2004 as stated by the staff in the same paragraph. Incidentally,
it was not a “failure” but a decision of the Argentine government, in consultation with
management and staff, to postpone that review for the reasons by all known. Thus, if
we are going to measure the effort that Argentina has made to honor the “de facto”
privileged creditor status of the IFIs after its most serious crisis in contemporary
history, the meaningful figures should not be the ones reported in paragraph 6 but the
following: from the beginning of the crisis in January 2002 up to date, Argentina has
made net principal payments to the Fund of SDR 3 billion (about US$ 4.4 billion)
and paid charges of SDR 1.4 billion (about US$ 2.1 billion), adding to total net

-3payments to the Fund of SDR 4.4 billion (around US$ 6.5 billion). For the same
period, net debt payments to all the IFIs amounted to more than US$ 12 billion.
7. Paragraph 7 on political developments rightly links the high popularity ratings of
President Kirchner with his willingness to take a tough line vis-à-vis multilateral
institutions and the utility concessions. It is not right, however, when in the
paragraph the same association is made with the attitude towards foreign investors
and the debt exchange. Regarding foreign investors, President Kirchner and Minister
Lavagna has repeatedly stated their desire to create a favorable climate for investment
in general and for foreign investment in particular, a desire that has been followed by
concrete commitments on the part of several foreign companies. In the second place,
we do not believe to have taken a “tough line” with respect to the debt restructuring
process but rather a “realistic and focused” approach since this was the only way to
complete such a difficult task. Beyond this, it should be recalled that the restructuring
was not aimed only at foreign creditors since a substantial part of that debt was held
by Argentine nationals themselves, much of it through private pension funds.
8. As to the popularity gained with the treatment to privatized utilities, the staff report
fails to draw the proper conclusions by leaving the impression that this is the way the
Argentine government will deal with foreign capital in general. The approach towards
privatized utilities should not be construed as animosity towards foreign capital. It is,
rather, a reaction against the perceived bias framework that these companies, in
connivance with the government of the 90s, applied to the Argentine people. A more
balanced view than the one presented by the staff regarding the renegotiation of
contracts with privatized companies should also mention utility companies’
underperformance in terms of investment, their over-indebtedness (related to
generous dividend policies), as well as inherited unsound regulations, which among
other contentious elements established US dollar-denominated utility rates, indexed to
the U.S. inflation, an unwarranted benefit which companies seek to preserve even
after a currency devaluation of more than 50 percent. The staff report also expresses
the concern that some of these companies are leaving the country, as if they were the
innocent victims of an unruly government, with the logical consequences of affecting
the investment climate and growth prospects. This is a distorted picture of what is
going on. Moreover, the more significant fact is not that a few companies have
decided to abandon the country but that so many of them, despite all the difficulties,
have decided to stay. In fact, many of the companies that left the country, did so as
part of a regional strategy. As to the rest of paragraph 7, starting with the second
sentence, it could be disposed of and no relevant information would be lost. As it
stands, it fails to give an accurate account of the complexity of the present-day
political developments in Argentina and it risks creating confusion if it remains in the
paper. Also, considering the ambiguity of the first sentence, the whole of paragraph 7
could be eliminated from the paper.
9. Moving now to the discussion of recent macroeconomic developments, the staff
report raises three issues, the need to increase the primary surplus above the level
projected in the budget for the current year, the need to contain inflationary pressures

-4and the need to support a continued high volume growth of exports to sustain growth.
Whereas these are sensible points raised by the staff my authorities have reservations
with some of the rationale presented in the report to support them.
10. On the level of the primary surplus, the staff argues for a considerable higher level
than that proposed by the authorities not only for this year but also for the long-term.
In the short-run, the staff’s position is supported by the need to avoid the procyclical
impact of a looser fiscal stance vis-à-vis the one prevalent in 2004, and, in the longrun, so as to allow for a softening of the financing needs in a context where Fund
financing is non-existent. Regarding the current year, is worth noting that
notwithstanding the budgeted primary surplus level and the fact that this is an
electoral year, the primary surplus obtained so far remains comparable to the one
observed during the exceptional overperformance of 2004 which, as Argentina’s
economy moves into more moderate rates of growth, should not be used as a
yardstick to measure this year’s fiscal performance. During the first five months of
the year the primary surplus reached already 60 percent of the budgeted amount for
the year as a whole. Thus, for all practical purposes the staff’s warning as to the risks
entailed by the budgeted fiscal stance has been so far fully avoided. If the staff
wishes to make a meaningful comparison between the fiscal policy stance between
2004 and 2005, the actual fiscal performance of 2004 should have been compared
with the one that is taking place so far, and not with that that is being budgeted.
11. Regarding the long-term consequences of a primary surplus lower than the one
suggested by the staff, we will comment further below when analyzing the DSA
exercise. We will only note here the apparent inconsistency of staff’s advice that at
the same time that calls for a permanently high primary surplus, demands the
elimination of the so-called distortive taxes (that provide for some 4 percent of GDP
in fiscal revenue) and the approval of a new revenue sharing law that would, as we
will explain further on, necessarily reduce the central government’s stake in the
overall fiscal revenue. It should also be noted that the Argentine tax rates are in
general already at a relatively high level and that the notable improvements in fiscal
administration will sooner or later find their natural limits. On the spending side, the
staff suggest “a prioritization of capital spending” as a way to secure significant
savings. It is indeed surprising that after the heightened conscience on the importance
of infrastructure investment to consolidate growth, as exemplified by the many pilot
projects on the preferential treatment that should be given to this type of expenditure,
yet the staff did not hesitate to recommend in paragraph 20 of the report the same old
policy advice that has led many emerging countries to the deplorable state in their
countries’ infrastructure with serious negative consequences for growth. As an
example, for the vast majority of agricultural firms, the efficiency loses due to poor
infrastructure are higher than the impact of the export tax. On the whole, and in order
to keep perspective we would like to point out that the overall public balance has
been in permanent surplus since 2003, reaching 3.7 percent of GDP in 2004 and
projected to be (under the authorities scenarios) 1.3%, 1.8% and 1.9% in 2005, 2006
and 2007 respectively.

-512. On the need to contain inflationary pressures, my authorities are fully committed to
that goal and have taken the necessary fiscal and monetary measures conducive to
that end. As repeatedly mentioned to the IMF mission, further tightening policies
will be taken if needed to keep inflation in line with the target. Thus, acknowledging
the presence of pressures on the general price level and not just transitory seasonal
factors and changes in relative prices. My authorities are surprised that paragraph 21
gives a different impression on both accounts. On the fiscal front, we have already
mentioned the exceptionally large primary surplus. On the monetary front, the Central
Bank authorities have undertaken a forceful sterilization of the monetary
consequences stemming from their policy to replenish Central Bank’s reserves.
Sterilized interventions in the context of temporarily heightened inflation
expectations have pushed up the interest rates of the 90-day bills issued by the Central
Bank which have raised from 3.5 early this year to 6.2 in the latest public offering.
Thus, the argument in the staff report that the acquisitions by the Central Bank of US
dollars at the local foreign exchange market run the risk of excessively increasing
money supply should be countered by the impact of the sterilization policy that is
taking place. In addition to its sterilization policy, the Central Bank has increased its
benchmark rate for short-term loans to the banks several times so far. Another
important instrument to contract money supply has been the program offering
incentives to banks to make anticipated cancellations of the rediscounts that were
granted at the height of the crisis, which are carrying relatively high interest rates.
13. The increase in money demand derived from the larger than expected growth of
economic activity should also be factored in at the moment of assessing the risk of
persistent monetary pressures. In this regard, the rise in the money multiplier is a
welcome development to the extent that it comes associated with a revitalization of
bank credit, a necessary condition to support investment and economic activity in
general, particularly for the very large number of small and medium sized companies
working in Argentina, particularly when the ratio of credit to GDP has fallen sharply
after the crisis and is now only at 9 percent, compared to 23 percent during the late
1990s. Finally, regarding the dampening effect on growth of administrative controls
and moral suasion alluded by the staff as an inappropriate means of containing
inflationary pressures, is worth explaining that these encompass only a limited subset
of goods pertaining to low-income consumption baskets for each category while the
majority of goods remain fully free.
14. Regarding the need to support a high volume of exports to sustain growth, it is a
welcome development that export volumes in general and manufactured goods in
particular are growing steadily, thus the government strategy of maintaining a
competitive foreign exchange rate appears to be working. It is a well known fact that
adjustments of exchange rates and the changes in relative prices entailed take time to
produce the transformation of the productive structure necessary to generate more
exports. In addition, the staff report asserts that export taxes are damaging the export
performance without providing any supporting evidence. Export taxes not only
contain the increase in prices of basic consumer products but they also provide the

-6revenue to finance the social programs that were and still are much necessary to
address the social consequences of the crisis.
15. My authorities agree with the staff that the key variable to ensure a continued strength
of exports over the medium-term is through the increase in productivity and in the
efficiency of the economy. Thus, they are fully committed to create a favorable
investment climate through market confidence in their sound macroeconomic and
structural policies. The latter notwithstanding, my authorities are of the view that an
appreciated currency, as experience during the 90s, will eventually become an
insurmountable hindrance towards sustainable growth, hence they are bent to avoid
this to happen again. Argentina has paid a high cost in the recent past in terms of
employment and growth for neglecting the importance of the appropriate value of its
currency. In any event, the present nominal value of the currency, which has found a
widespread acceptance, particularly among the banking and businesses communities,
represents a real appreciation rate for the peso of 16 percent vis a vis the US dollar,
since early 2003. Incidentally, Box 2 suggests that the increase in the unemployment
rate in Argentina was related to the higher labor market participation rate of women.
This explanation hides more than it reveals the real factors at work. The
unemployment in the 90s was generated in fact by the economic model in place, fully
in line with the Washington Consensus. If more women wanted to work was out of
the sheer need to support their unemployed husbands. This increase in female labor
market participation can never be identified as a major explanation for an increase of
12 percentage points in the unemployment rate, as the one experienced between 1992
and 2001.
16. On the structural front three issues are highlighted in the staff report: the
intergovernmental fiscal relations, the soundness of the banking system, and the
renegotiation of contracts with privatized utilities. Regarding intergovernmental
fiscal relations the staff makes the point that whereas the post-crisis fiscal stance was
disciplined, this has only occurred in a context of a lack of available financing. Thus,
were the financing constraints to disappear, fiscal discipline would no longer be
assured unless institutional changes were introduced. We find this to be an unfair
remark. Firstly because it gives no credit to the authorities’ efforts to discipline
provincial financial administration; efforts that have, as the staff should have said it,
resulted in substantial provincial savings for the first time in decades. Secondly and
beyond the authorities’ willingness to administrate fiscal resources with austerity, we
feel that the staff makes no justice to the recently approved Fiscal Responsibility
Law. This law may not be as un-realistically strict as wished by staff but it contains
key improvements in relation with the past when no specific rules existed, except for
the temporary arrangements of the post-crisis years through the orderly financing
programs. More importantly, both the federal and the provincial level of government
have a clear track record in slashing down the presently high levels of indebtedness
and to avoid market financing of the budget..
17. The federal organization of government in Argentina makes it very difficult to
introduce policies that may be perceived as infringing on the provinces’

-7independence. The present FRL establishes clear limits to current spending and debt
accumulation while increasing transparency. It is the best agreement under the
present circumstances; it has already been ratified by 18 of the 24 provinces,
representing more than 80 percent of total provincial spending and there is no
political nor constitutional space left to attempt a comprehensive reform as requested
by the staff. In the same vein, the staff’s suggested reforms of the current
intergovernmental tax revenue sharing system do not have much of a chance of been
agreed upon shortly, as proved by the failure of the government attempts to reform
the coparticipation law during 2004 as well as in many other occasions. Moreover,
the streamlining of the current revenue sharing system, despite its positive aspects,
would have in the short run some serious shortcomings. In the current circumstances,
a new coparticipation law can only be the result of a revenue loss by the Central
Government. This, of course, is totally at odds with the need for the central
government to sustain a high fiscal primary surplus in the coming years.
18. Another important area of structural policy raised by the paper is the soundness of the
banking system including with regard to the strengthening of its capital base and the
strategic role of the public banks which obtained after the crisis a larger participation,
in relation to the pre-crisis period. This has been the result of the decisions of
individual banks’ customers that naturally found, at a time of crisis, that public banks
offered a safer place to keep their savings. It has nothing to do with administrative
decisions of the public sector to take over private banks. In this regard, it is important
to clarify the statement in paragraph 33: “the share of the banking system in the hands
of the state has increased sharply”. In fact, since 2002 public banks have only
increased their share in total deposits marginally, mainly explained by a strong
increase in public deposits. Moreover, since December 2003 to March 2005, the
share of public banks in total deposits decreased from 47 percent to 46 percent, while
deposits of the public sector in these banks increased by 11 percentage points. As to
the strategic role for public banks my authorities believe that the financial system
should operate in the service of sustainable, stable and equitable economic
development. In this vein, we believe that public banks have an important role to
play in particular to reach areas of the country and segments of the population and of
the business community that private banks are not naturally inclined to reach. My
authorities are committed to fulfill these tasks in a manner that does not resign
efficiency nor profitability for the public banks while keeping a close regulatory
oversight. The strategic review for Banco Provincia, already completed, and for the
Banco Nación soon to be initiated, will provide important suggestions as to the best
ways to increase productivity and efficiency of those banks. It is worth noting that the
review for Banco Provincia has shown a picture much more encouraging than the one
many skeptical pundits were expecting. The Banco Provincia is already implementing
a medium-term action plan to further improve its operational performance.
19. Paragraph 33 also states that “the share of public securities in bank’s portfolios has
risen substantially”. It is important to indicate that even considering BCRA bills, the
share of public securities in bank’s portfolios was slightly reduced from 50 percent by
the end of 2003 to 47 percent in April, 2005. However, BCRA bills are not counted

-8as part of the regulatory government bonds limit of 40 percent of assets. Considering
this last definition, government bonds in banks’ portfolios represent on average 38
percent of assets, while their share has been reduced since the beginning of the year.
My authorities are not retracting from any of the regulatory norms in place which
allow for a temporary forbearance until international standards are fully applied.
20. Regarding the strengthening of the capital base of the banking system, the gradual
strategy of the authorities continues to be implemented successfully. The system has
not only reduced its losses during 2004, as mentioned in paragraph 12 of the report,
but it has also obtained operational profits during the first quarter of 2005 in the wake
of a continued increase in total deposits and of the rapid growth of private sector
credit that is taking place. Profits is the key variable that will allow for a progressive
strengthening of the capital base of the system both directly through their
capitalization and indirectly through the incentives they create for a voluntary
recapitalization, which will certainly be reinforced by the overall positive economic
environment present in the country. In any event, important progress in the balancesheet of banks has already occurred through the reduction of external debt in many
banks including through debt capitalization. The early repayment of rediscounts has
also contributed to strengthening the banks’ capital base. In addition, fresh
capitalization has also taken place in the recent months. Looking forward, all banks
have completed their business plans for the current and coming years which
incorporate an important improvement of their capital bases.
21. Moreover, the staff highlights the need to complete the compensation for asymmetric
pesoization and indexation of bank assets and liabilities. However, in my authorities
view this has already been largely done. What is still pending is due to differences of
opinion between the BCRA and the banks on the legality of a small proportion of the
claims (around 10 percent of total claims). On the issue of court injunctions
“amparos”, also raised by the staff, the position of the authorities has been quite clear
all along. It was stated from the beginning that this was a problem that falls under the
competence of the judges and that the government was not going to compensate
banks for this motive. Some favorable decisions from the Supreme Court upholding
the “pesoisation” has contributed to a dramatic halt of further judicial claims sharply
reducing the amount of “amparos”. In the meantime, banks have been allowed to
amortize the losses generated by “amparos” during a five year period.
22. Finally, on the structural front there is the issue of the renegotiation of contracts with
privatized utilities. In this regard, I would like to state in the first place that it is
important not to downplay the progress that has been reached in several important
areas such as ports and highway concessions, freight railways’ operators and
electricity companies. In addition, only a few conflicting cases seem to gain press
coverage and the analysis presented is in general simplistically reduced to the
question of tariffs, as it transpires for example from the staff report. As a matter of
fact, the most serious underlying issue is the balance sheet positions of the companies
burdened by very high indebtedness in hard currency that needs to be restructured.
The government is making utmost efforts to facilitate those restructurings. The

-9question of investment commitments looking forward is also a critical aspect that is
not duly considered when addressing the issue of the privatized utilities. In any event,
the government is committed and is already implementing a progressive adjustment
of tariffs that are progressively starting to impact family units. All these
developments aim at ensuring a profitable business environment for companies while
addressing the needs of the more vulnerable social groups.
23. As to Argentina’s response to the recent decision against Argentina by the
International Center for Settlement of Investment Disputes ( ICSID) in favor of a
company owning a minority stake in one of the two gas transportation companies,
which is seeking compensation for the losses originated in the pesoification and
freezing of utility rates since 2002, I am not aware as of yet of any formal reaction
from the Argentine authorities. I can tell, however, that my authorities have
questioned all along the legitimacy of those claims since the essential aspect of the
international investment protection agreements signed by Argentina is to guarantee
foreign investors that they will not be subjected to any discriminatory treatment and
such a situation has not taken place. As to the argument that the devaluation of the
currency, the pesoization and the freezing of tariffs could be assimilated to an indirect
expropriation, my authorities consider that this is tantamount to say that the economic
policy of a sovereign could be made subject to judicial judgment, which is obviously
inappropriate. Moreover, it is noteworthy that the mentioned decision recognized that
no expropriation has occurred as a result of the pesoization and tariff freeze; as such
the finding in favor of the claimant appears inconsistent. It is revealing in this respect
that the company holding the majority stake in the gas transportation company
involved in this dispute has withdrawn its claims with the ICSID and there were
recent public announcements, both from the company and the authorities, indicating
that an agreement is soon to be reached.
24. On the Argentine debt restructuring, the staff presents a biased description of the
characteristics and consequences of the restructuring, regardless of the time and
efforts that my authorities devoted to describe the process to the staff. For example,
the staff conclude in Box 5 and paragraph 48 that Argentina has not complied with
the lending into arrears policy (LIA). This comes as a surprise because it is not the
result of a substantiated analysis, that should be based not only on the nature of the
Argentine debt restructuring but also on the LIA policy itself. Moreover, the staff’s
assertion is not only unsupported, but it brings a subject that does not pertain to this
Art. IV discussion but rather to a specific analysis that should be, in due time,
considered by the Board.
25. Having said this I will, nevertheless, take issue with the aforementioned unsupported
assertion made by the staff. The main purpose of the LIA policy, that is to normalize
relations with creditors, has been advanced as recently ratified by the rating agencies.
In this respect, Argentina has fully complied with the LOI dated March 10, 2004, as it
had indeed "endeavour[ed] to avoid a piecemeal approach to the debt restructuring".
This was the overarching objective to which the Argentinean authorities were
committed and it was, indeed, achieved with great success. At the time we were

- 10 negotiating the LOI some were arguing that the only way in which a piecemeal
approach could be avoided was by establishing a minimum participation threshold (a
75 percent of adherence to the offer was broadly regarded as appropriate). Argentina
did not believe that it was necessary to set such a nominal minimum participation
threshold but nevertheless committed to "endeavour" to avoid a piecemeal approach
and agreed –in order to discharge that commitment— to "finaliz[e] with the
assistance of the banks an appropriate minimum participation threshold necessary for
a broadly supported restructuring". In sum, finalizing an appropriate minimum
participation threshold was subsidiary to the overarching objective of achieving a
broadly supported restructuring. Argentina, after considering the matter with the
banks decided that, given the complexity of the process, it was not convenient to
include in the prospectus a nominal minimum participation threshold as by
establishing a minimum participation threshold the ultimate objective could be
hindered. This eventually proved to be the right approach since the debt offer was
accepted by a vast majority of creditors; a number of creditors that, it is fair to say,
goes beyond the minimum participation threshold that was considered appropriate at
the time in which the LOI was negotiated. "
26. In Box 5 it is stated that “negotiations with private creditors were not constructive for
the most part”. This is viewed by my authorities as an unfair statement to the extent
that the Argentine authorities traveled the world over to meet all types of creditors
explaining to them the real limitations Argentina faces, including the fact that it did
not have net financing from the IFIs, and listening to their desires and concerns. In
fact, the final exchange offer, in terms of the characteristics of the new debt
instruments, was shaped by the several suggestions gathered in those meetings (i.e.
the incorporation of GDP-linked bonds, the Most Favored Lender Clause, and the
Law 26.017, precluding the executive branch to re-opening the debt exchange offer).
As to the fact that there were no formal “negotiations” around a table with all
creditors, I have to recall that this is exactly what has occurred in all the previous debt
restructurings where the majority of the debt was in the hand of a multiplicity of bond
holders1. It is worth noting that the LIA policy does not demand negotiations with
creditors in all cases.
27. From the authorities and the Staff’s DSA analyses it is quite clear that even with the
substantial hair cut obtained, the fiscal effort required over the medium-term will be
totally unprecedented for the Argentina economy. Of course, as we will see below,
the staff finally manages to make its point, but in our view at a serious cost to its
credibility. It is indeed a challenge for the authorities and for the whole of the
Argentine people to be able to meet the commitments created by the exchange offer
and those associated with the consequences of the crisis, i.e. to compensate losses to
the banking system and address the manifold social needs. The Argentine exchange
offer embeds the maximum effort the Argentine economy was able to make without
jeopardizing growth prospects. Going beyond that would have represented indeed a
1

“The Successful End of the Argentine Debt Restructuring Saga”, March 2, 2005 by Nouriel Roubini.

- 11 bad faith negotiation to the extent that most likely it would lead to another default in
the future.
28. Regarding the treatment of the holdout creditors, is important to reaffirm that this was
the result of a free choice by those creditors perhaps ill-advised by the ones that were
supposed to defend their interests. The government of Argentina went to extremes to
make clear that the exchange offer was the only one that was going to be put forward
and that not sweeteners to the offer should be expected. In the end, a minority of
creditors, opted for rejecting the offer. The Argentine authorities have made clear that
they acknowledge the existence of such a contingent liability and have indicated their
intention to formulate in due time a forward looking strategy to address, within the
legal framework and in consistency with the prospectus for the exchange offer, any
remaining arrears with private creditors.
29. In discussing the Argentine debt sustainability analysis, the staff characterize as
unrealistic the authorities scenario, called scenario A. It is somewhat startling that
under the assumption that current policies are maintained, policies that as we have
seen have yielded exceptional results, the staff considers that growth will decline to 2
percent a year whereas inflation and borrowing costs would increase. The staff do
not attempt to explain the authorities underlying assumptions of the DSA (scenario
A), which are consistent with the actual developments of the Argentine economy and
the objectives of the Argentine government: sustainable output growth, employment
creation and poverty reduction. In my authorities’ view, the main variable to achieve
those objectives is a strong macroeconomic framework. Only in this context
structural reforms could be effective, since the main factor behind the sluggish GDP
growth rates and its large volatility, particularly during the last three decades, has
been the absence of a consistent macro framework and not the lack of structural
reforms. In this respect, it is fair to recall that during the 1990s Argentina was
considered a star performer by the IMF basically because of its widespread structural
reform agenda while downplaying the lack of a consistent macroeconomic
framework. In the aftermath of the crisis, the authorities shifted emphasis and, as a
result, now the Argentine economy shows an impressive fiscal primary surplus
matched with trade and current account surpluses, a competitive exchange rate, as
well as a “dedollarization” of financial assets and liabilities. All this within a flexible
and stable macroeconomic framework. The IMF’s emphasis on structural reforms
seems to be fixed in the past by giving such a key role to structural reforms that
should be sequenced only in a social and political responsible manner. In spite of all
the economy’s favorable developments, the authorities conservatively assume that
GDP growth will converge to 3 percent, consistent with an investment to GDP ratio
of 21 percent, higher than the maximum ratio achieved during the Convertibility
period (20.4 percent in 1998 at current prices)2. Consistent with this growth rates,
employment creation and poverty reduction, the authorities estimate a moderate long
2

Nonetheless, my authorities are bent to pursue through their policies higher investment
flows, since this investment ratio is just enough to sustain 3 to 3.5 percent GDP growth.

- 12 run real exchange rate appreciation and prudent interest rates. There is a sharp
difference between the economic logic implied in the staff report and the authorities
analysis, as my authorities consider that the staff is drawing the simplistic assumption
that just by implementing structural reforms and by achieving an unrealistic primary
surplus higher growth will be accomplished.
30. Stated in paragraph 42 of the report is that “Fund purchases should not be relied upon
as a source of budgetary financing”. However, maintaining its stock of debt to the
Fund constant cannot be construed as representing budgetary financing strictly
speaking. It should be rather seen as a way to cover its overall financing gap since in
that case Fund financing would not be used to support current or capital expenditures.
The staff reassert its view in paragraph 44 stating that “since the currency board
regime, the central bank has onlent Fund resources to the federal government to help
finance its budget deficit” . This statement fails to say that this has only been the case
up until 2001, or to be more precise until the demise of the currency board. Since
2002 onwards, the budget accounts began rendering an overall surplus which was
used to substantially reduce the exposure of the Fund and other IFIs with Argentina.
31. The staff’s logic is further undermined by the fact that by excluding Fund financing
altogether, as in scenario B, the debt ratio would follow an unsustainable level. Even
the rosier staff scenario C, without Fund financing and higher primary surplus plus
structural reforms, would require a roll over rate of private sector debt during 20052008 higher than the possible market access estimated by the staff itself. It is only
under scenario D that the debt profile becomes sustainable and that there would even
be a financing surplus indicating a higher capacity to pay than the projected debt
obligations. It seems that, at last, the staff has proven that by maintaining over the
medium-term a primary surplus of 4.5 percent a year and by appropriating Central
Bank reserves (equivalent to 6.9 percent of GDP between 2005 and 2008) to pay the
Fund, Argentina could pay more to the private creditors. This scenario looks
particularly unconvincing, specially when less than a month ago Argentina’s external
position was characterized as vulnerable. Indeed, Argentina’s extension of
repurchase expectations was based on the fact that “Argentina’s balance of payments
outlook remains vulnerable in particular from the following factors: the relatively low
level of reserve coverage, the unclear prospects for reaccessing international capital
markets, and the large debt service payments falling due over the next 12 months—
including US$8.1 billion to the IFIs.” All together, it appears as if the whole purpose
of this preposterous exercise would have been to reach the conclusion that Argentina
does not need any assistance. Likewise, it seems as if the only objective of the
present and future Argentine governments should be to pay the Fund as soon as
possible and to content creditors while risking growth prospects and postponing in the
meantime the alleviation of the pressing social needs that besiege much of the
country’s population.
32. As stated, scenario D is predicated on the authorities resorting to the foreign exchange
reserves of the Central Bank to finance repurchases to the institution. The staff argue
that this is a common practice among the membership. This came as a surprise to my

- 13 authorities, in fact, at least within our constituency this is not common practice. It
would be interesting if the staff could provide more evidence on this practice. In my
authorities’ view the reduction of the stock of debt with the Fund should not call into
question the Central Bank’s independence, nor hinder its capacity to exert an
effective monetary policy and defend the national currency’s value. Consequently, it
is our view that repurchases to the Fund should be based on fiscal surpluses or, when
reasonable interest rates make it appropriate, on market based financing. The staff
becomes more specific in Annex 1 when it suggests that the government should give
the Central Bank 15-year bonds, with a five-year grace period, to preserve the
financial integrity of the BCRA. The fact is, however, that the foreign exchange
reserves are there to support the money supply and government bonds cannot do that
and therefore the value of the currency, once a transaction of this type is done, would
be affected by an immediate weakening pressure that could intensify inflationary
pressures.
33. Finally, my authorities are somewhat baffled by the assertion in footnote 9 that “Fund
purchases and repurchases were not generally relevant to the government financing
framework”, if that were indeed the case it would beg the question as to why
governments would want to enter into the usually difficult negotiations required to
agree on a Fund program. Moreover, this assertion is contradicted by the same report
in paragraph 42 when trying to justify that the debt sustainability analysis DSA
should not assume access to Fund financial support since as the report affirms “Fund
purchases should not be relied upon as a source of budgetary financing even though
this has been the practice in Argentina”. As we have already stated, my authorities
are not envisaging any budgetary financing from the Fund. This has been indeed the
case only during the 1990s and it is precisely the consequences of that irresponsible
behavior, including on the part of the Fund, which my authorities are trying to
overcome.
