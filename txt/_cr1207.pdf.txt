STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2011 ARTICLE IV CONSULTATION
November 21, 2011

KEY ISSUES
Context: Barbados is struggling in the aftermath of the global crisis, with a slow
recovery underway. Tourism, offshore financial services and construction were
especially hard hit, but some activity has resumed. In response, to limit employment
losses and shield vulnerable groups, the government increased social spending, putting
pressure on public finances and raising public debt further. The authorities are revising
their medium term fiscal strategy to improve fiscal outcomes mainly by reducing
spending. Downside risks from the weak external environment are increasing.
Focus of the consultation:
The main policy challenge is to implement a credible fiscal strategy without
jeopardizing the still-fragile recovery. To this end, policy discussions focused on fiscal
consolidation and external stability in presence of high debt, financial stability
(including the resolution of CLICO Barbados), and enhancing medium term growth
prospects. The staff made the following recommendations:


Fiscal consolidation and external stability: Push ahead with efforts to put debt
on a sustainable path and to sustain the peg. Broaden the coverage of the revised
Medium Term Fiscal Strategy to include public enterprises. Focus on expenditure
reduction, especially lowering transfers to public bodies and reducing the wage bill
since room for further tax increases is limited.



Strengthening financial regulation and supervision: Minimize fiscal costs in the
CLICO resolution and seek a private sector solution. Increase provisioning as a
prudential measure for insurance companies and make the financial sector more
resilient to shocks through frequent monitoring and improved risk management.
Strengthen the supervisory capacity of the Financial Services Commission through
technical assistance from international agencies, including CARTAC, and intensify
efforts to improve regional financial stability.



Enhancing medium term growth prospects: Continue efforts to improve
productivity since total factor productivity is low. Improve the efficiency of
government services including by consolidating agencies with complementary
mandates and reducing the bureaucratic burden on the private sector.

BARBADOS

BACKGROUND
1.
Barbados has been severely affected
by the global economic crisis, which has
curbed tourism and offshore activity with
broader impact on other sectors. Economic
activity is estimated to have contracted by a
cumulative 5 percent between 2008 and 2010
with broad economic weakness also hurting
the labor market. Depressed tourism receipts
and high commodity prices have adversely
affected the external sector putting pressure
on reserves.
2.
The government focused on social
stability in the face of the economic crisis.
The authorities responded to the economic
slump by implementing a number of
countercyclical measures to protect
employment and minimize the impact of the
crisis on vulnerable groups, while sustaining
economic activity. A Tourism Investment Relief
Fund was set up in 2009 to encourage the
renovation of tourism related facilities and an
employment stabilization scheme was
introduced to allow employers to defer for one
year their contribution to the National
Insurance Scheme (NIS) contingent on the
maintenance of employment levels. These
measures combined with weak revenues to
create a large fiscal deficit and worsened the
debt-to-GDP ratio.
3.
To stem the rising debt, the
authorities developed a Medium Term
Fiscal Strategy (MTFS) in early 2010. The
strategy aims to reduce the fiscal deficit of the
central government, balance the budget over
the medium term, and reduce the debt-to-

4

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

GDP ratio to 90.5 percent by 2014/15 while
ensuring moderate growth. The framework
proposes a number of revenue and
expenditure measures to be pursued over the
medium term. Based on these adjustments, the
fiscal deficit to GDP ratio is projected to
decline to 2.1 percent by 2013/14 and then to
a balanced position by 2014/15. The MTFS
went off track in the first year of
implementation due to weaker global
conditions and low revenues, and the
authorities are currently revising the strategy.
The MTFS is not binding however and no date
has been established for the revised strategy
to be in place.

RECENT DEVELOPMENTS AND OUTLOOK
5.
The difficult global economic
conditions continue to pummel Barbados
with growth at anemic levels despite the
rebound in tourism, while inflation is
surging:


After two years of negative growth, real
GDP growth in 2010 was a mere
0.2 percent. In the first nine months of
2011 GDP growth is estimated at around
1 percent due mainly to improved activity
in the tourism and construction sectors.



Money growth has eased, while credit to
the private sector has dried up. Since 2008
broad money has grown marginally, rising
only by 2.8 percent in 2010. Total deposit
growth in the banking system decelerated
after a peak in 2007, and is yet to fully
recover. Growth of credit to the private
sector has almost vanished, slipping
further in September 2011 by 0.2 percent
(y/y). At the same time, the spread
between the average loan and deposit
rates narrowed slightly as the average loan
rate declined to 9 percent.

countries and trading partners, possibly
reflecting a higher mark-up and wageproductivity gap in the domestic economy.

Tourist arrivals

GDP growth



Tourist arrivals increased by 8.7 percent y/y
in August, 2011 (Box 1). However, real
tourism expenditure declined by about
15 percent (y/y) in June 2011 as visitors cut
their length of stay and looked for value,
limiting the economic impact of the higher
headcount, notably on reserve
accumulation.



Pressures on prices have increased.
Inflation is estimated to have reached
10.4 percent (y/y) in July 2011 due to high
international oil and food prices. Non-core
inflation––food, fuel and transportation––
which constitutes about 57 percent of
household consumption, increased by
14.4 percent. Inflation in Barbados
consistently exceeds those in neighboring

6.
The prolonged adverse economic
environment has negatively affected the
labor market. The unemployment rate has
almost doubled since 2007 from 6.7 percent to
12.1 percent in June 2011. Faced with declining
profitability, private sector employers are no
longer able to maintain employment levels
despite government incentives (including
postponement of national insurance
contributions) to retain workers. The average
unemployment rate in tourism, construction,
and wholesale and retail trade sectors
increased from 9.8 percent in June 2007 to
16 percent in June 2011.

budget target. The overall fiscal deficit for the
non-financial public sector (NFPS) reached
7.3 percent in FY 2010/11. Budget execution in
the first half of FY 2011/12 appears to be on
track to achieve an overall central government
deficit target of 5.1 percent of GDP, and
4.1 percent of GDP for the NFPS.

7.
The current account deficit has
widened in recent times due to higher oil
and food prices. The current account deficit
rose to 9 percent of GDP for the first nine
months of 2011, compared with 8.7 percent for
the corresponding period of 2010, mainly due
to higher oil and food prices. Even though oil
imports volumes declined, price surges of up
to 42 percent increased the fuel import bill by
about one-third. International reserves,
however, reached 4.5 months of imports at
end-September 2011 having been boosted by
public and private capital inflows.
8.
Fiscal performance remains
worrisome. The FY 2010/11 central
government deficit widened to about
8½ percent of GDP from 8.2 percent of GDP in
FY 2009/10. Expenditures increased by
½ percentage points of GDP, while revenue
weakness, particularly in corporate taxes,
implied an overall deficit in excess of the

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

9.
Public debt continues to rise though
rollover risks are limited. At the end of
FY 2011, total public sector debt was
117 percent of GDP, up from about 91 percent
two years earlier. Domestic debt accounts for
about 70 percent of public debt, mostly at
fixed rates. Its main holders are the NIS and
the domestic banking system. Debt rollover
risks are limited since the NIS will continue to
buy government securities and hold them to
maturity (Box 2). In addition, external debts are
mostly long term and have a favorable
amortization profile.

The banking system is stable and
well capitalized but non-performing loans
are on the rise and loan loss provisioning
remains low. At the end of June 2011, bank
capital averaged about 17.4 percent of riskweighted assets. Non-performing loans
increased from 7.9 percent in December 2009

BARBADOS

to 10.3 percent in September 2011 due to two
substandard loans to the hotel sector, while
provisioning remained at around 3½ percent.
The ratio of liquid assets to total assets
increased sharply to 12.8 percent, pointing to
ample liquidity in the banking system. Stress
test results from the Central Bank show that
commercial bank would, under reasonable
additional stress, remain adequately
capitalized.

the downside. The current tepid and
uncertain pace of the global recovery is likely
to weigh on growth in Barbados. Given the
weak labor market conditions in the U.K. and
U.S., Barbados’ major source markets,
sustained increases in tourist arrivals appear
challenging. Consequently, the output gap will
only narrow in the medium term. Barbados’
high level of public debt severely constrains
room for further government spending in
areas such as capital projects which might
boost growth prospects. A further slowdown in
advanced economies will dampen the recovery
and put additional pressures on the
macroeconomic situation.

Output Gap and GDP Growth

11.
The economic outlook for the
remainder of this year and 2012 is likely to
remain weak, predicated on the tepid
global recovery. While tourism is picking up,
the rest of the economy is sluggish. Real GDP
growth is expected to be just over 1 percent
building on an anticipated further rebound in
tourism. Higher international oil and food
prices are expected to push inflation to slightly
above 7 percent y/y in December 2011, with
some easing in 2012. The external current
account deficit is projected to widen to about
10½ percent of GDP due in part to lower
export receipts and high oil and food prices,
this year and narrow in 2012. The reserve
coverage would remain at around 4 months of
imports by year-end supported by steady
private and public capital inflows.

Global economic developments will
weigh heavily on the balance of payments
in the medium term. Barbados’ reserves are
projected to fall continuously in nominal terms
due to weak external demand for tourism.
Reserve coverage above three months of
imports would be sustained over the medium
term provided that strong net FDI inflows are
observed with the revival in the main trading
partners and tourism source markets. At the
same time, the current account deficit is
projected to decline to 5.6 percent of GDP in
2016.

14.
The authorities stand ready to take
additional actions if risks were to worsen in
the near-term. Staff and the authorities
discussed the need to develop fiscal
contingency plans to reduce spending or

increase revenues should global economic
conditions worsen in order to achieve the
budget targets and maintain external stability.

POLICY DISCUSSIONS
The main policy challenge is to implement a credible fiscal consolidation strategy without
jeopardizing the still-fragile recovery. To this end, policy discussions focused on fiscal
consolidation and external stability, financial sector stability and the regulation of the
nonbank financial institutions, and the authorities’ efforts to improve competitiveness and
promote growth.

A. Fiscal consolidation and debt reduction
15.
Staff sees the main macroeconomic
challenge as fiscal consolidation against the
backdrop of the high level of public debt.
With public debt on an unsustainable
trajectory, the priority is to reduce the debt to
below 100 percent of GDP in the medium
term. Staff argued for the implementation of a
comprehensive medium-term fiscal strategy,
based on realistic macroeconomic
assumptions as a lynchpin of a credible fiscal
consolidation plan. In this context, the
coverage of the authorities’ revised Medium
Term Fiscal Strategy (MTFS) would have to be
broadened to include public enterprises, a

8

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

major source of rising debt. The revised MTFS
needs to be supported by a long-term strategy
to significantly reduce the debt level since
debt levels of around 100 percent of GDP pose
unsustainable debt servicing risks.
16.
The 2010 Article IV mission
recommended a number of revenue
enhancing and expenditure reducing
measures to consolidate fiscal imbalances
and reduce the debt levels. On the revenue
side, the mission suggested an increase in the
VAT by 3 percentage points to 18 percent
combined with the broadening of the tax base,

BARBADOS

elimination of exemptions and improvements
in tax administration. On the expenditure side,
the mission recommended bringing down
public sector wages and spending on goods
and services and adjusting tariffs in public
utilities. The authorities implemented some of
the recommendations including raising the
VAT rate from 15 to 17.5 percent for a period
of 18 months, an increase on excise taxes on
gasoline by 50 percent, and the elimination of
some tax free allowances for travel and
entertainment. In addition, bus fares were
raised and some fees and charges for
dispensary services were adjusted. However,
containing expenditure growth generally has
proved more challenging.



Make the recent increase in the VAT rate
permanent, broaden the tax base and
explore the scope for increasing the
corporate tax rate particularly for offshore
operations as activity recovers.



Develop a plan to reduce tax exemptions
(currently estimated at BD$500 million
annually, 5.6 percent of GDP) by at least
15 percent by 2015. Intensify monitoring of
exemptions in order to minimize leakages
and prevent abuses. Publish data on
companies receiving concessions to
enhance transparency.

16

17.
Staff and the authorities agreed on
the need to focus fiscal consolidation on
expenditure reduction since room for
further tax increases is limited. In particular,
measures to reduce public wage spending and
transfers to public enterprises should remain
the focus of the expenditure reductions. In this
direction, staff recommended the following
measures:


Curb the public wage bill by freezing
wages for at least two years and reduce
the wage to GDP ratio to the level in the
mid 2000s. This would require reducing the
current ratio from 10 percent of GDP to
8.5 percent.



Similarly, lower the ratio of transfers to
GDP to the level in the mid-2000s. This
would require reducing the current ratio
from 12 percent of GDP to 10 percent.



Raise tariffs in public enterprises and
combine with efficiency improvements to
limit losses. Consider privatization and
outsourcing where feasible.

Staff’s medium term active fiscal
adjustment scenario would put public debt
on a downward path thereby enhancing
external stability without destabilizing
social cohesion. The adjustment scenario is
based on an aggressive fiscal effort similar to
the one proposed in the medium term fiscal
strategy. The cumulative impact of the
recommended measures will be a reduction in
the central government deficit from
8.3 percent in FY 2010/11 to a surplus of

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND 9

2011 ARTICLE IV REPORT

BARBADOS

3.2 percent in FY 2016/17. As a result, total
public sector debt would gradually fall to
about 92 percent of GDP by the end of
FY 2016/17. Relative to the baseline scenario,
public debt will be about 15 percentage points
of GDP lower in FY 2016/17.1 Slower wage
growth could have beneficial signaling effects
on the private sector and would reduce
imports’ growth and improve the current
account balance in the medium term.

Under this scenario, nominal central government
spending grows cumulatively by 16 percent between
2011 and 2016 compared with a cumulative 21 percent
growth under the baseline scenario. Nominal revenues
grow by a cumulative 56 percent over the same period
compared with 45 percent under the baseline scenario.
The revenue gains accrue mainly from reduction in
exemptions and improvements in tax administration.

10

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

19.
Barbados’ high level of public debt
raises debt sustainability concerns. Debt
sustainability analysis suggests that even
under the adjustment scenario with the
required aggressive fiscal efforts, the public
debt would not follow a sustained downward
path under most standardized shocks. Debt
sustainability will remain vulnerable until debt
ratios decline further in the long run.
20.
While welcoming the fiscal
adjustment proposed in the 2011/12
budget, staff pointed out that even more
consolidation would be necessary to put
Barbados’ debt on a sustainable path. The
FY 2011/12 budget, presented to Parliament in
early August, proposes to reduce the central
government deficit further to 5.1 percent of
GDP in line with the existing Medium Term
Fiscal Strategy (MTFS). The budget narrows the
deficit by about 1 percentage point of GDP
over the budget estimates. Most of the savings
are projected to come from improvements in
the efficiency of government and cuts in
spending on goods and services, wages, and
transfers. The overall deficit for the
nonfinancial public sector is projected at
4½ percent of GDP in 2011/12. Staff
encouraged the authorities to develop
contingency plans in the event uncertainties
especially on growth, in the global and
domestic environment materialize. Staff urged
the authorities to identify concrete measures
to help achieve the budget target as well as on
a contingency basis. Even under the best
implemented MTFS, Barbados’ debt remains
very high, above 90 percent of GDP.

Staff urged the authorities to reduce

public borrowing has permitted delays in fiscal
adjustment (the NIS exposure to the
government increased from 54 percent in 2005
to 69 percent in 2011).2 At close to 70 percent,
NIS’ current exposure to government is well
above the prudential guideline of below
54 percent recommended in the 2005 actuarial
report. Noting increasing liabilities as the
population ages, staff also cautioned that NIS
be allowed to better match its assets and
liabilities by limiting further exposure to the
public sector. To increase investment
opportunities, it remains important for
Barbados to intensify efforts to promote the
development of domestic and regional capital
markets.

The authorities indicated their
commitment to strengthen fiscal
performance and place the public debt on a
sustainable path. While recognizing the
urgency for fiscal adjustment, they
highlighted the risks of a further decline in

2011 ARTICLE IV REPORT

economic activity by cutting expenditures too
fast. They noted that they are currently revising
the Medium Term Fiscal Strategy and remain
committed to its implementation to help put
the debt on a sustainable path. They concurred
with staff on the need to reduce the wage bill
and transfers and plan to reduce the public
work force by natural attrition. Staff and the
authorities agreed on the need for engaging
the social partnership to initiate a national
discussion on the appropriate and affordable
level of social spending, especially in light of
the doubling in income per capita over the last
two decades. The authorities also agreed with
staff on the need to reduce tax exemptions
since the level of exemptions is too high. They
indicated that ad hoc waivers have already
been cut by 10 percent and reiterated their
commitment to further reducing exemptions
by about 10 percent over the medium term.
23.
The authorities disagreed with staff
that reducing borrowing from the NIS
would help NIS better match assets and
liabilities. Reiterating limited domestic
investment opportunities, they argued that no
domestic investment, in the current
environment, will yield returns comparable to
government securities. Staff and the
authorities, however, concurred that reducing
the high fiscal deficits in pursuance of the
medium term fiscal strategy will reduce the
financing needs of the government and help
reduce the reliance on the NIS. Staff and the
authorities also agreed on the need to
discourage direct lending to public
corporations by the NIS and for NIS to pay
attention to its capacity to monitor the wide
range of projects currently being undertaken.

B. Monetary and Exchange Rate Policies
24.
While the real effective exchange
rate is broadly in line with fundamentals,
concerns about external stability are
increasing. Results from real exchange rate
assessments do not provide any conclusive
evidence of a significant misalignment of the
exchange rate (Box 3). While results from the
fundamental equilibrium exchange rate
approach show the real effective exchange
rate to be close to its equilibrium level, the
macro balance and the external sustainability
approaches show an overvaluation of between
7 and 11 percent. Further, declining reserves
combined with a persistently higher inflation
relative to peers, suggests a challenge to
competitiveness. Staff shares the authorities’
view that the exchange rate peg has served the
country and should be maintained. The
sustainability of the peg, however, depends on
the authorities’ ability to successfully address
risks to external sustainability including related
pressures on the current account from high
fiscal deficits. The authorities stand ready to
take additional actions if risks were to worsen
including a strengthened fiscal effort.
25.
Staff argued against further declines
in interest rates due to potential pressure
on reserves and the exchange rate, with
uncertain impact on growth. The central
bank’s response to the weak economy has
been to ease monetary conditions, lowering
the minimum deposit rate from 5 to
2½ percent. With inflation close to 7 percent,
negative real deposit rates could create
misalignment with policy rates in core
economies, given usual country spreads, thus
exacerbating pressures on foreign reserves and
the exchange rate peg. Overtime, it is
important to remove the floor on the deposit
rates and move towards a market determined

12

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

rate. Staff urged the authorities to avoid
monetizing central government deficits to
maintain credibility in the peg and curb
inflation expectations.
26.
The new foreign exchange
regulation sends mixed signals to the
financial sector and private investors about
the credibility of the peg. In August 2011,
the central bank introduced two changes to
the foreign exchange regulation:


The introduction of a surrender
requirement whereby authorized foreign
exchange dealers are required to surrender
5 percent of their gross foreign exchange
purchases to the central bank.



Reduction in the central bank’s selling rate
on currency trades from BDS$2.035 per
US dollar to BDS$2.015 per US dollar
thereby lowering the margin for trades
between authorized dealers and the
general public. While the 5 percent
surrender requirement may boost the
supply of foreign exchange to the central
bank, it is a backward step in the
liberalization process. This change, while
increasing the intermediary role of the
central bank in foreign exchange
transactions, could stymie the
development of the interbank market. Staff
therefore encouraged the authorities to
review progress in the coming months to
ensure that it is having the desired effect.

BARBADOS

Authorities’ Views
27.
The authorities reiterated their
stance on retaining the floor on deposit
rates and defended the new foreign
exchange regulation. They noted that the
minimum deposit rate acts primarily as a signal
to banks concerning the prevailing economic
conditions. They argued further that the
expected benefits of the removal of the floor

2011 ARTICLE IV REPORT

such as improved market efficiency and the
development of capital markets would not
materialize due to the oligopolistic structure of
the banking sector in Barbados. On the foreign
exchange regulation, the authorities’ intention
is to boost competition in the foreign
exchange market, while agreeing with staff on
the need to monitor international reserves
carefully.

C. Financial Stability and Regulation
28.
The high level of non-performing
loans may persist in the near term, while
the banking system should remain resilient
to adverse shocks in the real economy. Staff
pointed out that the recent increase in nonperforming loans requires closer supervision.
The authorities argued that the recent sharp
increase in NPLs is associated with two hotel
loans concentrated in one bank. Excluding the
two loans, the NPL ratio is estimated to be
around 6.6 percent, which is slightly higher
than the central bank’s prudential guideline of
5 percent. Recent stress tests results from the
central bank suggest that in the near term,
while loan delinquency is expected to remain
high under various macroeconomic stresses,
banks’ capital positions would remain
sufficient to cover the potential losses. Staff
stressed the need to make the financial sector
more resilient to shocks through frequent
monitoring and improved risk management.
Staff commended the authorities on the
progress made in implementing the
recommendations of the 2008 FSAP Update
(see Appendix II) and welcomed the fact that
the money laundering and financing of
terrorism (AML/CFT) bill was before
Parliament. Staff looked forward to its final
approval.

29.
Efforts to resolve problems in the
insurance sector are underway. Notably with
respect to CLICO, a final report of the Judicial
Manager has been submitted to the Supreme
Court. With the options laid out by the Judicial
Manager to the High Court ranging from
outright liquidation to the formation of a new
company, a decision by the authorities is
needed to move ahead (Box 4). The preferred
option of the Judicial Manager is unlikely to
materialize due to the weak financial position
of the Barbadian and ECCU governments. In
the absence of fiscal space, it is important to
seek a private sector solution to the resolution
of CLICO. Meanwhile, the resolution of British
American Insurance Company (BAICO) is near
completion. The judicial managers for BAICO
in Barbados had recommended that the
company’s assets be liquidated.3 Staff stressed
the importance of a coordinated regional
approach to financial sector supervision and
the need for providing a mechanism for
establishing a framework for crisis resolution.
30.
Staff supported the authorities’
ongoing efforts to reform the supervisory
framework. A new regulatory body—the

the resolution of CLICO. They indicated that
they are considering a fifth option which may
involve a sale of the traditional insurance
business and/or liquidation, with the end of
2012 as the timeline for the conclusion of the
resolution. The authorities also noted that the
resolution of BAICO is near completion with a
minimal level of exposure to the government.
They concurred with staff on the need for
regional frameworks to address financial sector
problems and are actively involved in
initiatives in this regard.

D. Growth Enhancing Structural Reforms
32.
Raising total factor productivity is
important to raising medium term growth
prospects. Barbados has a relatively good
business environment as attested by the World
Economic Forum’s Global Competitiveness
Index and the Travel and Tourism
Competitiveness Index (TCI). The TCI ranks
Barbados at the top of CARICOM and 3rd in
the Americas behind the US and Canada (Box
5). However, total factor productivity in the
country has been declining with important
welfare consequences. Staff encouraged the
authorities to continue their efforts to raise
productivity. To this end, it is essential to
improve the efficiency of government services
including by consolidating agencies with
complementary mandates and reducing the
bureaucratic burden on the private sector.
Staff supported the authorities’ efforts to
reform public financial management, tax
administration and debt management and to

number of reforms to improve the business
environment and make the public sector

regulations, business development
architecture, improving trade logistics and
trade facilitation, and strengthening the
public-private dialogue on competitiveness.
Second, they described ongoing efforts to
modernize public procurement practices with
the objective of improving the transparency
and integrity of the system as well as lowering
costs.

E. Statistical Issues
34.
Given Barbados’ level of economic
development, more needs to be done to
improve the quality and periodicity of
statistics. While data coverage is relatively
good, serious weaknesses persist in the timely
delivery of most macroeconomic data,

including national accounts, prices, external,
and debt data. Staff recommended the use of
CARTAC technical assistance to help improve
both the quality and timeliness of data and
their release to the public.

STAFF APPRAISAL
35.
Barbados continues its struggle out
of the global economic crisis and a slow
recovery is underway. Real GDP growth will
be tepid at less than 1 percent this year
despite higher tourist arrivals, as overall
economic activity is subdued. Weak external
demand for tourism will limit international
reserves accumulation. The medium term
prospects are uncertain with risks tilted to the
downside. The current weak and uncertain
pace of the global recovery is likely to weigh
on growth in Barbados in the near term.
36.
The main policy challenge is to
implement a credible fiscal consolidation
strategy without jeopardizing the stillfragile recovery, To put Barbados’ debt on a
sustainable path while supporting the peg, the
medium-term fiscal strategy (MTFS) needs
urgent implementation, beginning with
concrete expenditure cutting measures. While
the recent temporary hike in the VAT rate is
commendable, it should be made permanent.
More effort is also needed to curb spending
and rationalize government services, while the
coverage of the MTFS should be broadened to
include public enterprises.
37.
Fiscal consolidation should have an
expenditure focus since room for further
tax increases is limited. Measures to reduce
public wage spending and transfers to public

enterprises should remain the focus of the
expenditure reductions. Staff recommends
reducing the wage bill (including a wage
freeze) and transfers to public enterprises to
trim spending. Tariffs in public enterprises
need to be raised to limit losses and tax
exemptions minimized.
38.
Staff supports the fiscal adjustment
pursued in the 2011/12 budget while
highlighting the need for more concrete
measures to achieve budget targets and
bring the debt to a sustainable level. It is
essential to develop contingency plans to
ensure that budget execution is above and
beyond targets in view of uncertainties in the
global and domestic environment. Staff urges
the authorities to intensify efforts to rein in
government spending particularly on wages
and non-essential services, better prioritize
new government projects and broaden the tax
base to bring the debt on a firm downward
trajectory.
39.
While the exchange rate peg has
served the country well, it needs to be
reinforced by a credible fiscal consolidation
effort to lower deficits and support external
stability. The sustainability of the peg will
depend on the authorities’ ability to
successfully address risks to external
sustainability related to ongoing fiscal deficits

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND 15

2011 ARTICLE IV REPORT

BARBADOS

and high public debt. While the exchange rate
is close to equilibrium, efforts should be
intensified to address the risks to external
stability from large fiscal imbalances. Given the
weakening in reserve coverage and the
authorities’ commitment to the exchange rate
peg, it is important to monitor net foreign
reserves closely. Staff sees the need to
maintain a positive interest rate differential visà-vis the United States to encourage capital
inflows.
40.
The banking system is stable and
healthy but regulation needs to be
strengthened. The recent increase in
nonperforming loans coupled with low loan
loss provisioning poses risks to the financial
system, although banks have adequate capital
buffers. It is essential to make the financial
sector more resilient to shocks through
frequent monitoring and improved risk
management. Financial sector resilience would
be enhanced through better risk management
and upgrading of provisioning requirements to
international standards. Further, monitoring
should be stepped up, including through
better information from banks on their loan
portfolio.
41.
Staff encourages the authorities to
minimize fiscal costs in any plan to resolve
CLICO and to seek a private sector solution.

16

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

The CLICO failure underlines the importance of
a coordinated regional approach to financial
sector supervision and the need for providing
a mechanism for establishing a framework for
crisis resolution. Staff supports the authorities’
ongoing efforts to reform the supervisory
framework, including through the newly
operational Financial Services Commission
(FSC). Staff encourages them to continue
strengthening the supervisory capacity of the
FSC including through technical assistance
from CARTAC and other international
agencies.
42.
Measures to improve productivity
should remain high on the agenda. While
indicators of non-price competitiveness do not
point to serious competitiveness problems,
total factor productivity growth has been
disappointing. Improving the efficiency of
government services including consolidating
agencies with complementary mandates and
reducing the bureaucratic burden on the
private sector will help boost productivity
growth. Staff welcomes the authorities’ efforts
to improve the energy mix by investing in
renewable energy.
43.
It is recommended that the next
Article IV consultation with Barbados be
held on the standard 12-month cycle.

Tourist arrivals from major source markets
remain strong. Data from January to August 2011
show that arrivals from major source markets
improved substantially, with Europe outpacing the
others. Notably, the growth in regional arrivals,
especially from Trinidad and Tobago, underscores
the importance of the Caribbean market to
Barbados. Overall, the growth in arrivals was
enhanced by intensified marketing, air lift capacity
expansion in source markets, due partly to the
introduction of low-cost carriers, and a number of
sporting events in Barbados. However, arrivals may
weaken next year, as the UK Air Passenger Duty is
re-introduced, airlines adopt the Emissions Trading
Scheme (ETS), and London hosts the 2012 Summer
Olympic Games.

Barbados continues to face fierce competition
from emerging tourist destinations. Barbados is
one of the most mature tourist destinations in the
Caribbean offering beach-type products for
exclusive clientele. Emerging tourist destinations in
the region, particularly the Spanish-speaking
countries, which account for 40–60 percent of the
Caribbean market share, compete with Barbados for
tourists from the same source markets, with the
Canadian market being severely affected recently.
Available data indicate that these rival destinations
offer similar products at much lower prices.

Brand repositioning, further airlift capacity
expansion and global recovery are critical to
improve tourism activity. Barbados needs to
continue to reinvent and expand its products, while
engaging more in marketing. Relative to
competitors, the destination enjoys a more balanced
market penetration. Nevertheless, securing more
airlift, especially from emerging markets, reduction
in cost of access and global recovery are critical to
enhancing growth in tourist arrivals in the near to
medium term.

Box 2. Barbados: Sectoral Balance Sheet Mismatches and Macroeconomic Vulnerabilities
Macroeconomic vulnerabilities have increased in
Barbados since 2006 due to the high public
sector debt and the deterioration in the net
financial position with nonresidents. Staff used
the Balance Sheet Approach to analyze changes in
macroeconomic vulnerabilities in Barbados between
2006 and 2009. The main finding of the analysis is
that the balance sheet of the aggregate economy
has weakened by the recent deterioration in the
balance sheet of the non financial public sector. The
private sector, however, seems to be healthy and
resilient to shocks. A sensitivity analysis of the
balance sheet impacts of a 30 percent devaluation
shows that the economy would struggle to
withstand large exchange rate devaluation with the
public sector the most vulnerable.

However, the negative financial position does not
seem to make the public sector particularly
vulnerable to sudden shifts in investor sentiment.
External debt is mostly long term and has a
favorable amortization profile, while domestic debt
is held by relatively stable investors, including the
domestic financial system and the National
Insurance Scheme.

The Non-Financial Public Sector (NFPS)
The NFPS appears to be the most vulnerable
sector in Barbados because of its negative net
financial and net foreign currency positions. The
recent high fiscal deficits have weakened the net
financial position of the sector. Most of the NFPS’
liabilities are denominated in domestic currency but
the limited foreign currency assets have generated a
net negative foreign currency position making it less
resilient to exchange rate shocks.

18

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

The balance sheet of the private sector appears
sound because of its positive net financial and
net foreign currency positions. The financial sector
does not appear vulnerable to the direct effects of
exchange rate devaluation. Regulatory requirements
on liquidity and foreign exchange exposures have
induced banks to remain liquid and only modestly
exposed to foreign currency risk. Declining
profitability has affected the net financial position of
the non financial corporate sector but net foreign
currency position is still positive.
The analysis suggests the need to reduce
macroeconomic vulnerabilities by reducing the
level of public debt; accumulating foreign reserves;
promoting market based hedging mechanisms,
strengthening prudential oversights to limit foreign
currency mismatches in the financial sector; and
promoting the development of domestic securities
markets to allow domestic residents to diversify their
exposure from the non financial public sector.

Box 3. Barbados: Real Exchange Rate Assessments
Empirical analyses using the CGER methodologies
do not provide any conclusive evidence of a
significant misalignment of the real exchange
rate. Specifically, the results from the fundamental
equilibrium exchange rate approach suggest that the
real exchange rate was close to equilibrium level at
the end of 2010. Results from the macro balance and
the external sustainability approaches suggest an
overvaluation of between 7 and 11 percent.
The Fundamental Equilibrium Exchange Rate
Approach
This standard approach specifies a relationship
between the real exchange rate and a set of
fundamentals: productivity differentials, terms of
trade, government consumption, and net foreign
assets. Estimating the equilibrium real exchange rate
for Barbados may yield imprecise results given the
limitation posed by the short sample size. Thus, the
analysis is based on Pineda et al. (2009) specifying a
panel consisting of 21 CARICOM and tourismdependent economies, including Barbados. The
results show that the REER was close to equilibrium
at the end of 2010.

The Macro Balance Approach
In this analysis, the current account (CA) norm
for Barbados is computed in a pooled panel
setting based on estimates from Lee et al. (2008).
WEO’s projections up to 2016 are used for the
medium term fundamentals, which include: fiscal
and oil balance relative to GDP, relative output and
income, lagged CA, population growth and old age
dependency ratio. The projected current account
deficit of 5.6 per cent for 2016 is used as the
underlying CA. The difference between the
underlying CA and the CA norm (-3.8) is
-1.8 percent. Using the export and import volume
elasticities estimated by Lee et al (2008), the
elasticity of the current account balance to the real
exchange rate was computed as -0.3. As a result, the
real exchange rate would be over-valued by
7 percent.
The External Sustainability (ES) Approach
The external sustainability approach computes
the difference between the actual current
account balance and the balance that would
stabilize the net foreign asset (NFA) position at
some benchmark level. Based on the assumption of
an average medium term growth rate of 2 percent,
and a medium term inflation rate for the US of
1.6 percent, stabilizing Barbados’ NFA at the 2010
benchmark level of -70 percent of GDP requires a
current account deficit of 2.5 percent. Using the
elasticity of CA to REER and underlying CA, as in the
MB approach, the results point to and overvaluation
of 11 percent.

Box 4. The Resolution of CLICO-Barbados
The collapse of the Trinidad and Tobago-based
CL Financial Group represented a major financial
shock to the Caribbean region. The rapid
expansion of the group prior to the crisis was
financed mainly by deposit-like annuity products
(called EFPA) sold by the group’s insurance
subsidiaries – the Colonial Life Insurance Company
(CLICO) and British American Insurance Company
(BAICO). The returns offered on these annuities were
substantially higher than bank deposits rates, while
not being subject to stricter banking regulation and
supervision. These resources were then channeled to
finance real estate and other investments (mainly in
U.S.). With the deterioration of global economy in
2008, many of CL Financial’s subsidiaries faced
liquidity and solvency pressures. As news of
difficulties spread, investors rushed to withdraw
funds, triggering the collapse of its three financial
subsidiaries in Trinidad and Tobago and related
companies throughout the Caribbean, including
Barbados.
While the resolution of CLICO/BAICO in
jurisdictions with small exposures is nearly
complete, the resolution in Barbados is under
judicial management. On April 14, 2011, the
Supreme Court of Barbados appointed Deloitte
Consulting Ltd. as Judicial Manager (JM) of CLICO
International Life Insurance Ltd. (CIL). At that time,
the unaudited figures for CIL indicated a shortfall of
the life insurance company of about US$196 million
(4.4 percent of GDP). The July 28 CIL restructuring
plan filed by the JM in the Barbados Court proposed
that a new company be incorporated to hold the
business of CIL and that on a proportionate basis
60% of policyholder value be transferred to the new
company. Both traditional and EFPA policyholders
would be issued with common shares in the
company in exchange for the 40 percent write off in
their policy values. These shares would be issued at
little value but based on the company’s future
growth the shareholders may recover some or all of
the amounts lost.

20

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

The revised restructuring plan tabled in the Court
of Barbados by the JM in September provided
four restructuring options with funding
implications between US$28 million and US$76
million. Under all restructuring approaches, there
would be no financial impact on traditional
policyholders, while effects would differ for EFPA
policyholders:
 Under US$76 million financing, individual and
quasi government EFPA holders would receive full
value for their policies in the form of annuities,
while corporate EFPA holders would get full value
of their policies in equity in the new company.
 With US$52 million injection, individual
policyholders would be 100% refunded in the
form of annuities, whereas corporate and quasi
government EFPA holders would get shares in the
new company.
 Under US$47 million funding, individual and quasi
government EFPA holders would be entitled to
annuities for the principal balance and shares for
the interest on their policies, while corporate EFPA
holders would get full value of their policies in
equity in the new company.
 With US$28 million financing, individual
policyholders would receive the principal in the
form of annuities and the value of the interest in
shares, while corporate and quasi government
EFPA holders would receive the full value of their
investments in shares in the new company.
The government is in the process of deciding
which option is best. Following the four options
outlined by the JM the authorities are considering a
fifth option, which may involve a sale of the
traditional insurance business and or liquidation. The
time frame for CLICO resolution is end of 2012.
The supervisory/regulatory needs in the nonbank sector calls for urgency to bring the
Financial Services Commission (FSC) into
operation. The collapse of CLICO and BAICO bring
to the forefront the weakness of the insurance
supervisory system, also responsible for supervising
offshore companies. Barbados faces urgent needs to
address weaknesses in the insurance regulatory
environment.

2011 ARTICLE IV REPORT

Box 5. Barbados: Structural Competitiveness
Barbados has a good business environment as
attested by the World Competitiveness Index and
the Travel and Tourism Competitiveness Index.
Recent assessments by the World Economic Forum
(WEF) show that Barbados has consolidated its
global competitiveness position driven by excellent
institutional environment, a first-class educational
system, a well developed infrastructure, and
technological readiness. Ranked 43rd among 139
countries in the 2011 Global Competitiveness
Report, Barbados is more competitive than many
countries in the Latin America and Caribbean region.
Beyond its small market size, Barbados’ high deficit
and debt levels and to a lesser degree the
sophistication and innovation of its business sector
affected its overall standing. Trade barriers and
tariffs, crime and violence, HIV prevalence,
inflexibility of wages, hiring and firing practices, low
degree of customer orientation, restriction on capital
flows, and low financing through the domestic
equity market are factors that negatively affected the
country’s ranking.

The tourism sector in Barbados is probably the
most competitive in the Caribbean. The World
Economic Forum’s 2010 Travel and Tourism
Competitiveness Index ranked Barbados 28th, up
two places from 2009.

In the Americas, the country is ranked 3rd behind
the US and Canada. The country’s two key strengths
are its affinity for tourism and the priority given to
the sector. High government expenditure, strong
destination marketing campaigns, presence at key
international tourism fairs and hosting of sport
events attest to the importance of the sector to the
economy.

However, Barbados displayed weaknesses into
two measures: price competitiveness and policy
rules and regulations. High energy cost, relatively
high ticket taxes and airport fees, and high
accommodation rates drive up the overall cost of
stay. Although regulations on property rights, Visa
requirements and openness of bilateral Air Service
Agreements are commendable, the country appears
uncommitted to the General Agreement on Trade in
Services (GATS). Overall, to improve the policy
environment, it may need to reassess its rules and
regulations concerning foreign ownership of
investments, capital controls, and the general ease
and cost of setting up businesses.

APPENDIX I: DEBT SUSTAINABILITY ANALYSIS
1.
The results of the debt sustainability
analyses are broadly similar to those of the
2010 Article IV consultation. This section
updates the debt sustainability analysis from
the last Article IV consultation. While this
assessment projects slightly lower public debt
ratio over the medium term under the baseline
scenario due to a somewhat stronger fiscal
effort this fiscal year, debt remains high and
vulnerable to shocks.

scenarios. The baseline scenario assumes

continuing in the medium term.

some fiscal adjustment based on the 2012
budget and continuation of current policies.
The alternative scenario is based on the
premise that the current fiscal adjustment
would not be enough to bring about the
desired reduction in the debt level. It assumes
a number of additional policy measures to be
implemented beginning in the FY 2012/13 and

A. Main Assumptions and Scenarios
3.
The baseline and adjustment
scenarios share some common underlying
assumptions:


Economic growth remains subdued and a
recovery in the demand for Barbados’
goods and services commences in 2013.



There is no fiscal cost to the budget from
the resolution of CLICO.



The recent increase in the VAT rate is made
permanent and the fiscal balance improves
in the medium term.



The exchange rate remains stable and
capital inflows increases to finance tourism
related investments.

The Baseline Scenario
4.
The baseline scenario assumes some
fiscal adjustment based on the 2012 budget
and reflects continuation of current policies.
Under this scenario, the non-financial public
sector deficit is projected to decline from
7.3 percent in FY 2010/11 to 0.1 percent in
FY 2016/17 as the country recovers from the
economic recession and some of the fiscal
measures implemented starts bearing fruit.
Consequently, the public debt would decline
from 117 percent to 107 percent in
FY 2016/17. Externally, the current account is
expected to adjust gradually to about
5.6 percent of GDP by 2016. Capital inflows will
not be enough to cover the current account,
resulting in a decline of reserve coverage from
4.1 months of imports in 2011 to 3.1 in 2016.

The Adjustment Scenario
5.
The adjustment scenario is based on
an aggressive fiscal efforts similar to those
proposed in the Medium Term Fiscal
Strategy (MTFS). The scenario assumes that
additional fiscal measures will be undertaken
starting in FY 2012/13 encompassing mainly
expenditure reduction measures (see main
report for details) and increased efforts to
reduce tax exemptions and improve tax
administration.
6.
Most of the fiscal savings resulting
from the expenditure reduction measures
are expected to accrue in the medium term.
Consequently, the NFPS balance will improve
36

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

from a deficit of 7.3 percent of GDP to a
surplus of 4.6 percent of GDP in 2016/17.
Relative to the baseline, this represents a
cumulative improvement in the public debt to
GDP ratio of about 16 percentage points over
the medium term. The scenario also assumes
changes in the composition of spending in
favor of capital spending and better targeting
of social spending since they are critical to
boosting growth.
7.
The implementation of corrective fiscal
measures would put public debt on a
downwards path. After peaking in 2010/11 at
117 percent of GDP, public debt will reduce
significantly to 92 percent of GDP by the end
of FY 2016/17. Stronger investor confidence in

BARBADOS

the government’s fiscal policies will help
increase capital inflows including for tourism
related activities and thereby generate growth
higher than under the baseline scenario.
8.
The strengthened fiscal policy will help
improve the current account and increase
reserve coverage. Import growth will
moderate as fiscal policy tightens domestic

2011 ARTICLE IV REPORT

demand thereby improving the current
account balance. The healthier pace of private
capital inflows resulting from improved
investor confidence would help international
reserves to recover around 4.5 months of
imports by 2016.

B. Assessment of Debt Sustainability Analysis
Baseline Scenario

Adjustment Scenario

9.
Bound tests show that the public debt
trajectory is vulnerable to standards shocks.
Under baseline scenario, fiscal and growth
shocks adversely and significantly affect the
debt ratio. For instance, a permanent shock to
growth of about a ¼ standard deviation from
its historic levels will raise public debt to GDP
ratio to 150 percent. In like manner, public
debt will reach 120 percent of GDP if primary
balance were to follow historic trends. A
growth slow down in the UK and the US
(Barbados’ main tourism markets) would raise
the public debt to GDP ratio under the
baseline scenario.

11.
Under the adjustment scenario, public
debt is more resilient to standard shocks. The
debt profile improves significantly under this
scenario due to sustained fiscal adjustment
and higher overall growth. Bound tests show
that public debt will not continue to decline in
the presence of most standard shocks and the
fiscal account will remain vulnerable to shocks
until debt ratios decline further in the long run
External debt also improves and is more
resilient under standard stress tests.

10.
External debt is less sensitive to
standard shocks mainly due to the
comparatively low share of external debt in
total debt. Under baseline scenario, total
external debt after peaking at about
43 percent of GDP in 2010 will decline to
32 percent of GDP in 2016. Bound tests show
that external debt is mostly sensitive to
exchange rate devaluation. In particular, a
30 percent real depreciation would increase
external debt to 48 percent of GDP by 2016.

1/ Derived as [r - g - r(1+g) + ea(1+r)]/(1+g+r+gr) times previous period debt stock, with r = nominal effective interest rate on external debt; r = change in domestic GDP deflator in US dollar terms, g = real GDP growth rate,
e = nominal appreciation (increase in dollar value of domestic currency), and a = share of domestic-currency denominated debt in total external debt.
2/ The contribution from price and exchange rate changes is defined as [-r(1+g) + ea(1+r)]/(1+g+r+gr) times previous period debt stock. r increases with an appreciating domestic currency (e > 0) and rising inflation (based on GDP deflator).
3/ For projection, line includes the impact of price and exchange rate changes.
4/ Defined as current account deficit, plus amortization on medium- and long-term debt, plus short-term debt at end of previous period.
5/ The key variables include real GDP growth; nominal interest rate; dollar deflator growth; and both non-interest current account and non-debt inflows in percent of GDP.
6/ Long-run constant balance that stabilizes the debt ratio assuming that key variables (real GDP growth, nominal interest rate, dollar deflator growth, and non-debt inflows in percent of GDP) remain at their levels
of the last projection year.

ANNEX V.

2011 ARTICLE IV REPORT—INFORMATIONAL ANNEX

BARBADOS—STATISTICAL ISSUES

1.
While data provision has some
shortcomings, it is broadly adequate for
surveillance purposes. Barbados participates
in the General Data Dissemination System,
with metadata and the authorities’ plans for
improving the statistical base posted on the
Fund’s Dissemination Standards Bulletin
Board.

Real Sector
2. The Barbados Statistical Services
compiles national accounts statistics
according to the 1968 SNA manual. A
lack of current, reliable source data on
nonsugar agriculture, private
construction, and nontourism service
activities affects production-based GDP
estimates. To address some of the
weaknesses in this area the authorities
initiated a census of economic activity in
June 2005. The census covered tourism,
financial businesses, and transport and
communications. Expenditure-based
GDP estimates are derived from selected
surveys; the household survey yields a
reliable estimate of aggregate
consumption, but the external trade and
investment surveys suffer from certain
weaknesses. Constant price GDP
estimates, compiled by the Central Bank
of Barbados (CBB), have an outdated
1974 base year; the authorities are
currently updating the base year to 2000
in order to facilitate comparison within
the Caribbean Community area. The
authorities, with the assistance of
CARTAC, recently completed a revision
of the national accounts data. They
published the revised GDP series in

current prices, which revealed that
current GDP had been underestimated
in 2008 by about 10 percent. However,
the revised current price GDP data are
not consistent with the constant price
GDP data, which rely on 1974 as the
base year, and there are no meaningful
GDP deflator data linking both series.
These data shortcomings add some
uncertainty to GDP analyses and
projections, as presented in the staff
report. An early rebasing of the constant
price GDP data should be a high priority.
3. Starting in 2011, the BSS is responsible
for compiling value added (VA) by
industry at constant prices on an annual
basis, previously being the responsibility
of BCB. The BSS, with the assistance of
CARTAC in 2011, improved
methodology of computing VA by
industry with 2006 as a base year
replacing the dated base years used by
the BCB and BSS. Recently, preliminary
constant price estimates by industry
were completed; however, a continuous
improvement of the current and
constant price estimates is needed.
Work is underway on the compilation of
import/export price index and
producer’s price index (PPI) which when
completed would improve the quality of
VA of goods producing industries. The
estimates can also be fine tuned by
improving the survey response rate and
instituting proper editing of the data.
The BSS should create a section
responsible for editing the data and
classification of administrative data (VAT
and data from Inland Revenue)

supplementing the survey data collected
by the BSS. The BSS should develop
quarterly constant price estimates in
constant prices to be followed by both
current and constant price estimates of
VA by industry. The quarterly estimates
should be anchored to the annual
estimates.
4. The BSS, with support from CARTAC, has
continued work on developing producer
price indexes (PPI). The BSS has refined
the sample frame, modified the list of
establishments in the sample,
redesigned the initial collection form,
and selected representative products
and transactions to include in the
sample. The BSS has been following the
action plan but there has been a
slippage in the timing of the activities.
By the time of the CARTAC mission on
October 3–7, 2011, the plan called for
the sample selection to be completed,
the establishment initiation largely
completed, and the compilation system
in the testing process. Only the sample
was finalized, with 27 industries and 68
establishments selected that represent
90 percent of manufacturing output. The
initiation process was still underway with
only 12 of 68 establishments completed.
The BSS needs to to take the following
actions: complete the initiation process
by selecting the representative products
and transactions in the remaining
sample of establishments; finalize the
PPI compilation spreadsheet; collect
back prices from the PPI sample of
establishments for the June–October
period; and begin monthly price
collection for the PPI sample of
establishments with reference to prices
on the fifteenth of the month. The BSS

will try to complete the PPI by January
2012.
5. Despite recent initiatives to update the
consumer price index and the index of
industrial production, potential
misalignments in real estate prices are
not addressed due to the absence of a
systematic index of property prices. The
consumer price index uses an
expenditure basket for 1998–99 for its
July 2001=100 series introduced in
January 2002. The index of industrial
production is based on the sectoral
weights from 1982; the authorities are
currently working towards rebasing the
series to 1994. Since these outdated
base years do not necessarily reflect the
current structure of consumption and
production, they possibly distort the
derived price data.

Government finance statistics
6. Fairly comprehensive and up-to-date
above-the-line data are available for the
general government, but government
transfers are reported with a lag. As a
result of the incomplete coverage of offbudget transactions, a discrepancy exists
between the overall balance and
financing data in some years. Public
enterprise data are not systematically
and promptly reported to the Ministry of
Finance. Financial sector data on public
sector net domestic borrowing usually
cannot be fully reconciled with abovethe-line fiscal data, partly because of
limited availability of nonbank financial
sector information. This reduces the
degree of certainty about the actual
fiscal position. The authorities
introduced accrual accounting of public
finance in April 2007.

BARBADOS

Monetary and financial statistics
7. While some weaknesses remain with
respect to the overall quality, coverage,
and timeliness of the monetary and
financial statistics, they do not hinder
Fund surveillance. The 2007 and 2008
STA missions found that the quality of
monetary and financial statistics was
compromised by various
methodological problems,
misclassifications, and the inconsistent
application of residency criterion. The
technical assistance missions
recommended correcting a number of
misclassifications of accounting data
and assisted the CBB in compiling the
standardized report forms (SRFs). The

CBB has recently started compiling
monetary statistics based on the SRFs,
which include comprehensive detailed
depository corporations’ data.

External sector statistics
8. Lags in the compilation of merchandise
trade data, and infrequent and
incomplete information on the activities
of the offshore sector, limit the
timeliness of the external current
account balance estimates. Estimates of
the components of the external financial
account need to be improved. The
authorities, with assistance from
CARTAC, are working on compiling data
on the net international investment
position of Barbados.

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2011 Article IV Consultation with
Barbados
On December 05, 2011, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF)
concluded the Article IV consultation with Barbados.1
Background
The difficult global economic conditions continue to pummel Barbados with growth at anemic
levels and inflation and unemployment rates moving up sharply. After two years of decline, real
Gross Domestic Product (GDP) growth was only 0.2 percent in 2010, while estimates for the
first nine months of 2011 show an expansion of 1 percent due mainly to improved tourism and
construction activities. With overall economic activity remaining subdued, the unemployment
rate almost doubled from 6.7 percent in 2007 to 12.1 percent in June 2011. Pressures on prices
have increased with inflation estimated to have reached 10.6 percent (year-over-year) in August
2011, as commodity prices surged.
Fiscal performance remains under stress especially in the light of the high public debt. The
Fiscal Year (FY) 2010/11 central government deficit rose to about 8.5 percent of GDP from 8.2
percent of GDP in FY 2009/10. Expenditures increased by 0.5 percentage points of GDP, while
revenue weakness, particularly in corporate taxes, implied an overall deficit in excess of the
budget target. However, budget execution for the first half of 2011/12 fiscal year appears to be
1

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On
return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the
Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the
Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the
country's authorities. An explanation of any qualifiers used in summings up can be found here:
http://www.imf.org/external/np/sec/misc/qualifiers.htm.

2
on track to achieve an overall central government deficit target of 5.1 percent of GDP. Public
debt continues to rise. At the end of FY2011, total public sector debt was 117 percent of GDP,
up from about 90 percent of GDP two years earlier.
The current account deficit has widened in recent times due to higher oil and food prices. The
deficit widened from 5.6 percent of GDP in 2009 to 8.5 percent in 2010. While import volumes
contracted in the first nine months of 2011, higher commodity prices pushed up the import bill,
further worsening the current account deficit to around an estimated 10.5 percent of GDP in
2011. International reserves, however, reached a comfortable 4.5 months of imports at endSeptember 2011 having been boosted by public and private capital inflows.
The economic outlook for 2011 is weak with growth expected to remain soft. While tourism is
recovering, the rest of the economy is sluggish. Real GDP growth is therefore expected to
turnout at less than 1 percent this year despite higher tourist arrivals. The medium term
prospects are uncertain with risks tilted to the downside. A strong pick-up in economic activity
depends heavily on improvements in labor market conditions in the U.K. and the U.S.
International reserves are projected to come under pressure in the near to medium term.
Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors noted that Barbados was hit hard by the global crisis and has yet to fully
recover. Growth remains tepid despite a rebound in tourism, and risks persist from the weak
and uncertain global economic environment. While cushioning the impact of the crisis, the
authorities’ policy response has put pressure on public finances and further raised the public
debt. Directors saw as the main challenge the need to undertake a credible fiscal consolidation
without jeopardizing the fragile recovery and social cohesion.
Directors commended the authorities for adopting a revised Medium Term Fiscal Strategy
aimed at generating a balanced budget and reducing the high public debt-to-GDP ratio. They
emphasized that fiscal consolidation should focus on expenditure reduction, including lowering
the wage bill, reducing transfers to public enterprises, and minimizing tax exemptions. To bring
the debt on a firm downward trajectory, Directors encouraged the authorities to make further
sustained efforts to curtail and prioritize government spending, and enhance revenue, including
by broadening the tax base and making permanent the temporary hike in the Value-Added Tax.
They also recommended expanding the coverage of the fiscal strategy to include public
enterprises. In view of uncertainties in the global and domestic environment, Directors
encouraged the authorities to develop contingency plans to ensure achievement of the fiscal
targets. Directors welcomed the authorities’ plan to engage social partners in a national debate
on the level of social spending.
Directors observed that the exchange rate peg has served the country well. They emphasized
that a credible fiscal consolidation, together with efforts to enhance competitiveness, would be

3
crucial to support the peg and external stability. With the projected medium-term decline in
international reserves, Directors recommended close monitoring of net foreign reserves levels.
Directors noted that the banking system is stable and healthy. Nonetheless, the recent increase
in nonperforming loans, coupled with low loan-loss provisioning, requires close monitoring and
improved risk management. They welcomed the consolidation of supervision of the nonbank
financial sector under the newly operational Financial Services Commission, and recommended
strengthening its supervisory capacity. Directors encouraged the authorities to minimize fiscal
costs in any plan to resolve CLICO and to seek a private sector solution. They noted that the
CLICO failure underlines the importance of a coordinated regional approach to financial sector
supervision and a mechanism for establishing a framework for crisis resolution.
Directors welcomed the relatively good business environment in Barbados. They emphasized
the need to address the structural impediments to growth and improved competitiveness. They
saw scope for raising the efficiency of government services and reducing the bureaucratic
burden on the private sector.

Public Information Notices (PINs) form part of the IMF's efforts to promote transparency of the IMF's
views and analysis of economic developments and policies. With the consent of the country
(or countries) concerned, PINs are issued after Executive Board discussions of Article IV consultations
with member countries, of its surveillance of developments at the regional level, of post-program
monitoring, and of ex post assessments of member countries with longer-term program engagements.
PINs are also issued after Executive Board discussions of general policy matters, unless otherwise
decided by the Executive Board in a particular case.

Statement by Thomas Hockin, Executive Director for Barbados
and John Andrew Rolle, Advisor to the Executive Director
December 5, 2011

In the aftermath of the global recession and an external environment that remains highly
uncertain, the Barbadian authorities are committed to pursuing credible medium-term
policies to rebuild fiscal buffers, enhance financial stability and strengthen medium-term
growth prospects. In this regard, there is agreement with the thrust of the staff’s appraisal,
including on the downside risks associated with the country’s current fiscal situation. Yet,
the international environment remains more hostile than was anticipated when the Medium
Term Fiscal Strategy (MTFS) was first formulated, hence the need to revise the framework.
In this regard, the process of structural reforms will become more entrenched. The authorities
will also sustain their efforts to strengthen financial sector regulation and oversight, and
pursue a resolution strategy for failed insurance operations that keeps fiscal costs to a
minimum. To its advantage, an important feature of the Barbadian society is the cohesive
partnership between government, labor, and the private sector which helps in building
consensus on key policies.
Economic Background
Barbados’ economy is expected to grow very mildly in 2011, strengthening only to a modest
pace over the medium term. In particular, the increase in non-traded sector activity should
cushion a negative contribution from traded production in the current period, with net foreign
exchange earnings compressed due to slightly decreased real tourism receipts and an elevated
oil imports bill. Meanwhile, despite successful efforts to narrow the fiscal deficit to a
projected 5.1 percent of GDP from just above 8.0 percent in both 2009 and 2010, the debt
will rise further. In the protracted weakness in the private sector, retrenchments have led to
an increase in the jobless rate, even as the social partnership led by the public sector’s
initiative has been a source of significant stability. As the recovery strengthens, risks will
remain elevated, with tourism hindered by cautious consumer behavior in the advanced
economies, and the international businesses sector’s momentum slowed by the evolving
regulatory environment. FDI flows are also likely to recover at a tempered pace. The
upswing should nevertheless have a favorable impact on the banking system, reversing a
largely cyclical deterioration in credit quality.
Monetary and Financial Sector Polices
As the staff report acknowledges, the scope for monetary policy easing is limited in an
economy such as Barbados’ because domestic demand is not sustainable in isolation from the
strength of the foreign earning exchange sectors. The authorities therefore agree that further

2
relaxation of interest rates would not be appropriate at this time. The Central Bank of
Barbados (CBB) however decided that it was appropriate to take measures to remedy
information asymmetries and resuscitate the operations of the foreign exchange market. This
explains the August 2011 decision to impose a 5 percent surrender requirement on gross
purchases by authorized dealers. Contrary to the staff’s interpretation, this policy was not
intended to send a negative signal to the private sector, either as a rollback of earlier
liberalization or to spark concerns about the credibility of the peg. Both this measure and the
reduction in the margin on foreign exchange sales by dealers have been followed up by
heightened monitoring of the foreign exchange markets and increased communication
between the CBB and authorized dealers. In particular, the CBB began circulating daily
reports to dealers on the volume and breakdown of foreign exchange transactions and has
further stepped up its internal analysis to monitor the impact of the policy changes.
In the meantime, financial sector supervision and regulation continue to be enhanced. In the
banking sector, oversight remains heightened given elevated NPLs and credit risks. In this
regard, commercial banks enjoy strong capital buffers even under CBB imposed stress tests.
The enhanced banking sector surveillance will be further spotlighted, as the central bank
begins regular publication of a financial stability report in December 2011. For non-banks,
efforts to consolidate the regulatory regime are now more advanced following the April 2011
startup of the Financial Services Commission (FSC). Supervisory capacity will be built up in
this institution over the medium term, aided by technical assistance from CARTAC and other
external partners. In addition, the authorities remain focused on implementing the 2008
FSAP Update recommendations, with the Anti-Money Laundering Act approved by
Parliament on November 11, 2011.
Barbados is also moving closer to a resolution of the failed CLICO and BAICO insurance
operations, with a view to keeping resulting fiscal costs to a minimum. The contingent
exposure is expected to be negligible for BAICO, where the judicial management process has
already been concluded. In contrast, more substantial liabilities are a potential for CLICO.
The judicial management process for CLICO has been set in motion in collaboration with
governments in the OECS. This should clear the way for a regionally coordinated plan on
restructured as opposed to liquidated operations under private ownership. The judicial
managers are expected to present their final reports to the courts in the regional jurisdictions,
including Barbados, in December. The Barbadian government then expects to conclude the
sale of CLICO’s operations in 2012.
Fiscal Policies
The authorities believe that prudent fiscal policies are essential for the sustainability of the
exchange rate peg and that buffers have to be restored to weather future external shocks.
Larger primary balances meanwhile should also sustain the government’s ability to
effectively sustain pro-growth public sector investments. In this regard, the medium-term

3
fiscal strategy is still focused on reducing the debt-to-GDP ratio to near 70 percent. Since the
pace of the recovery is lagging expectations, the time frame for achieving the target is being
reviewed in the context of further adjustments to the MTFS. Nevertheless, the authorities are
cognizant of the need to balance the required adjustment against fiscal support to growing the
economy.
The government of Barbados has already adopted significant revenue enhancing measures
and tightened controls on spending. As to further revenue enhancements, the emphasis will
remain on administrative improvements. Just in November 2011, the Central Revenue
Authority (CRA) was established with a mandate to consolidate tax administration services.
Over the medium term, the CRA will achieve the merger of scarce capacity still located in
separate agencies and facilitate one-stop provision of taxpayer services. Looking ahead, the
government has also requested the Fund to assist with a comprehensive review of the tax
framework, with a view to defining a strategy on further revenue enhancements. The
authorities already agree that additional streamlining of tax concessions merits consideration
and that the applications and approvals process for exemptions could benefit from more
transparency. Notwithstanding staff’s advice, they are hesitant, however, to impose higher
corporate taxes on offshore operations as this could reduce the sector’s competitiveness,
particularly in comparison to zero-tax jurisdictions.
Staff rightly observes that even more significant expenditure savings are needed, which will
require reforms to social entitlements and more targeted subsidies and transfers. Such
initiatives will have to be approached through strong consensus among the social partners.
The authorities, though, appreciate the importance of keeping the wage bill under strict
control. A wage freeze has existed in government for the last three years, and is likely to
continue in the near term as there is no evidence of labor market pressures for changes. The
Government further intends to maintain a moratorium on hiring, and expects service delivery
reforms to reduce staffing in some public sector operations over time. For the state-owned
enterprises (SOEs), there is concurrence that operations have to be kept in line with the
MTFS. Subsidies and transfer provisions for SOEs have either been capped or reduced in the
current budget, and agencies have been required to identify compensating savings, as part of
a medium-term plan to steadily reduce subventions. It will take time to reduce support for
education, although the solution might involve a better alignment of subsidies with
development objectives. On health sector reforms, steps are already being taken to cap the
cost of some programs and eliminate indiscriminate benefits for non-nationals. Costs of
supporting the public transportation sector are also being scrutinized, although no policy
decision has been taken yet.
Our authorities are also making progress to enhance the debt management capacity, by
strengthening the coordination framework between the Ministry of Finance and the CBB. As
to vulnerabilities related to the current profile of the debt, they believe these are less
heightened than implied from the staff report (Appendix I). The debt is concentrated in

4
domestic currency, mostly at fixed rates, and with limited roll-over risk. In the meantime,
most of the external stock is in denominated US dollars, consistent with the currency profile
of Barbados’ trade, and with a smooth amortization schedule.
The Barbadian authorities noted the staff’s assessment that the public sector financing is too
reliant on the National Insurance Scheme (NIS) and that the NIS exposure exceeds a
prudentially recommended portfolio limit of 51 percent. However, they stress that, in the
current environment, reducing the exposure to government would leave a void of investment
opportunities for the portfolio. While cognizant of risks, the authorities maintain that the NIS
still has an obligation to maximize the return on its portfolio. Opportunities to invest in
public sector securities will naturally decline as fiscal consolidation takes hold. This should
coincide with greater scope for portfolio diversification into external investments, when more
vibrant foreign exchange flows are available to sustain such transactions. Even still, the
authorities believe that the NIS should also play an important direct role in supporting private
sector developments, within a prudent risk management framework.
Growth
Barbados is committed both to enhancing and diversifying its medium-term growth
prospects. Continued public sector investments in infrastructure are critical to this objective,
as well as exploiting further efficiencies in the provision of government services and other
direct measures to improve the business environment. Efforts are ongoing to bolster the
international business sector, by ensuring that the regulatory environment evolves in keeping
with global standards. In tourism, new initiatives are underway to increase business from
non-traditional sources in emerging markets, such as Latin America. Policies to enhance
external competitiveness are also targeting increases in workforce productivity and
reductions in the cost of energy. In the case of the latter, the authorities are promoting
increased reliance on renewable energy sources, such as wind and solar.
Conclusion
In summary, the Barbadian authorities remain committed to rebuilding the policy buffers
exhausted during the global recession. Pursuing reforms in the context of both the mediumterm development and fiscal strategies are consistent with this objective. A more resilient and
robust financial sector also accords with this strategy, hence sustained initiatives to enhance
and consolidate the regulatory framework. Its is also important to strengthen Barbados’
medium-term growth prospects, and this is being advanced through measures to further
improve the business environment, increase workforce productivity, and aggressive policies
to diversify the base of the economy. These initiatives will capitalize on Barbados’ highly
skilled labor force. The policy dialogue with the Fund as well as TA will remain highly
valued in this process.
