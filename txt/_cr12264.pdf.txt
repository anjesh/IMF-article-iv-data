IRELAND
STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2012 ARTICLE IV CONSULTATION
August 21, 2012

KEY ISSUES
Context: After an exceptionally deep banking crisis at a public cost of some 40 percent
of GDP, the Irish authorities’ steadfast efforts have restored stability. Ireland’s highly
open economy resumed modest growth in 2011 even as domestic demand continued
to decline. Banks have been recapitalized and significantly downsized. Substantial fiscal
consolidation has been implemented while preserving social cohesion. Bolstered by
hopes of strengthened European support, these efforts have rebuilt market confidence,
as evident in Ireland’s recent return to the sovereign bond market.
Risks: Public debt is high and still growing. The banking system is not yet serving
financing needs, including of the job-intensive SME sector. Households must contend
with heavy debts and depleted net wealth. High unemployment compounds the
financial distress, undermines skills, and drives emigration. The euro area crisis creates
uncertainty for exports, financial markets, and fixed investment. Thus, risks to economic
recovery remain large, with profound implications for debt sustainability.
Policies: Ireland must continue to deliver on three main fronts:


Intensive financial sector reforms to restore banks’ ability to extend sound credit to
help revive domestic demand. The central challenges are to arrest asset quality
deterioration while dealing with debt distress and to regain bank profitability.



Growth-friendly fiscal consolidation to stabilize public debt. The strategy needs to
combine careful expenditure targeting, reforms of core government services, and
revenue base-broadening including the introduction of a value-based property tax.



Broad based efforts to reduce unemployment, including additional well-trained
case workers to support jobseekers, regular monitoring of training outcomes, and
reforms to the structure of social benefits.

Support: Success hinges on external economic recovery and more European support.
Euro area leaders have pledged to break the vicious circle between banks and
sovereigns by enabling the ESM to recapitalize banks directly, and to examine the
situation of the Irish financial sector with a view to further improving the sustainability
of the well-performing adjustment program. Meeting these commitments will provide
stepping stones toward Ireland’s recovery and durable return to market financing.

IRELAND

BACKGROUND—AN EXCEPTIONALLY DEEP BANKING
CRISIS
1.
The ―Celtic Tiger‖ years came to an abrupt end in 2008. Suddenly, Ireland had to contend
with an interlocking sovereign–banking–real economy crisis. As property prices collapsed, banks’
losses on real estate loans mounted and domestic demand fell sharply. Fiscal deficits gapped
outwards and public debt catapulted from 25 percent of GDP in 2007 to over 90 percent by 2010.
Deepening uncertainty about the ultimate scale of the banking sector losses, and hence growing
doubts about public debt sustainability, drove a brutal switch in market sentiment in the Fall of
2010, cutting the sovereign off from market financing and compelling the authorities to resort to EU
and IMF financial support.
2.
The boom years stored up immense problems. Following a decade of export- and FDIled growth supported by broad-based productivity gains, from about 2003 on the Irish economy
embarked on a domestic boom underpinned by lax lending. Stiff competition for market share from
foreign-owned as well as domestic banks pushed underwriting standards lower, and the feedback

The post-Lehman global financial turmoil tipped the vulnerable Irish banking system
into a deep crisis. Ireland’s property price downturn began in 2007. After facing heavy losses on
property-related assets in the Spring of 2008, the banks suffered a run on wholesale funding in the

A full-fledged economic bust ensued. A steep decline in construction activity drove the
country into recession from 2008 with the sharp world trade contraction in 2009 adding to the shock
to Ireland’s highly open economy. Financial accelerators, having put the economy into overdrive in
the boom, played a major procyclical role in the bust as new lending stopped. Falling property

Confidence in the fiscal position crumbled, primarily as a consequence of the close
sovereign–bank interlinkages. During the boom the underlying fiscal position weakened
(Section IV.B), and an erosion of tax bases made for heavy reliance on property-related revenues
such as stamp duties. Accordingly, tax revenues fell hard when the economy turned, down by
30 percent from 2007 to 2009. This, together with rising social outlays, drove up the deficit (before
bank support) to over 10 percent of GDP per year in 2009–10, from fiscal balance in 2007. By 2010
these deficits raised net public debt by 33 percentage points of GDP. On top of this flow shock,
support to banks heavily burdened the public balance sheet. By 2010 the government had
recapitalized the banks to the tune of €46.3 billion, equivalent to 30 percent of 2010 GDP, with no
cushion from burden sharing on banks’ senior debt as considered appropriate by the ECB due to
concerns about pan-European financial stability.2 Given the already heavy public debt burden, high
market uncertainty around the scale of banking sector losses yet to be recognized meant that by
late 2010 the government was no longer in a position where its own guarantee could maintain
confidence in the banks. Indeed, when the banks faced renewed private funding outflows, the
sovereign also lost access to market funding, necessitating official support.3

RECENT DEVELOPMENTS—A TENTATIVE EXPORT-LED
RECOVERY
6.
Ireland returned to growth in 2011, but relied exclusively on exports (Table 1). Having
declined for the three preceding years, real GDP grew by 1.4 percent y/y in 2011.4 Export growth of
5.1 percent y/y led the way, with slowing growth in goods exports offset by continued strong
services growth. This performance benefitted

effective exchange rate decline, and from lower
labor costs—especially relative to those in the euro area—but is largely driven by productivity gains
from labor shedding, though these are partly compositional given high job losses in less productive
sectors. Nonetheless, staff estimate that some modest exchange rate overvaluation remains,
including in light of the large negative net international investment position (Annex I).

7.
Domestic demand, on the other hand, contracted by 3.7 percent y/y in 2011. The
decline in domestic demand was broad-based, with fixed investment continuing to lead the fall as
domestic and external uncertainties—together with credit supply constraints on some firms and
households—lowered private investment, and fiscal consolidation limited public capital expenditure.
Private consumption declined by 2.4 percent y/y, exceeding the decline in household disposable
incomes, as the household saving rate rose to 14 percent—well above the pre-crisis average of
8¼ percent—in order to rebuild balance sheets and reduce high debt. Fears over job prospects
likely added to precautionary saving, as employment fell a further 2 percent and the unemployment
rate climbed past 14 percent.
8.
The current account remained in modest surplus in 2011 while deflation came to an
end (Table 5). With domestic demand weak, imports declined moderately in 2011, contributing to a
3.3 percentage point of GDP rise in the trade balance, almost all of it in services. However, these
gains did not feed into domestic incomes and spending as they were offset by a 3.5 percentage
point of GDP rise in income outflows—principally to the parents of the multi-national firms that lead
Irish exports—leaving the overall current account surplus unchanged at about 1 percent of GDP.
These higher income outflows also meant that real GNP declined by 2.5 percent even as real GDP
grew. Following deflation in 2009–10, low but positive inflation was recorded in 2011 in both the
GDP deflator and HICP, in part reflecting energy price rises.
9.
Recent data point to modest growth in 2012, though signals are mixed (Figure 1). Solid
budget revenues in H1 suggest activity broadly in line with projections. Other indicators are less
clear:


Real GDP grew 1.2 percent y/y in Q1 2012, but fell 1.1 percent q/q. The 6.1 percent y/y
rise in export volumes was notably robust. Declining consumption was the chief drag on
growth, although this in part reflected the boost to consumption in Q4 2011 ahead of the
VAT rate hike. Real fixed investment grew 8 percent, but this was mostly a one-off effect
from aircraft purchases, largely offset by higher imports.



The unemployment rate hit 14.8 percent in Q1 2012. Total employment fell 1 percent y/y,
with job shedding in nine of 14 sectors, including further losses in construction.



After a surplus in 2011, the current account balance returned to deficit in Q1 2012 in
part reflecting some seasonality. Service exports performed well in Q1, with an almost
20 percent increase in computer service export values, although this was offset by significant
income outflows.



High frequency indicators point to consumption declining much as expected, and
continued buoyancy on the external front. Consumer sentiment improved somewhat in
June 2012 and the pace of decline in retail sales (excluding automobiles) slowed to
1½ percent y/y in H1, from a 2.6 percent decline in 2011. Industrial production expanded
5.3 percent y/y in Q2 and the PMI index of new export orders remained above 50, even
increasing in June and July, in contrast with most euro area countries.

The HICP inflation rate remained just under 2 percent y/y, compared with 2½ percent
for the euro area, with prices flat in Q2 after jumping 1¾ percent in Q1. Energy and
administered prices remain the most important drivers.

10.
The correction in house prices,
one of the largest in recent history, has
continued (Figure 2). The decline in nominal
residential property prices slowed to
14.4 percent y/y in June 2012. The index has
halved since its peak in 2007, eclipsing
recent U.K. and U.S. house price declines and
comparable to the Japanese and Nordic
experiences of the 1990s. As yet, clear signs
of stabilization are limited to Dublin house
prices (excluding apartments), which, after
dropping by 55 percent, have been flat in H1
2012. Rural areas, in contrast, still show signs
of oversupply.

Lending to households and SMEs has declined to low levels (Figure 3). New mortgage
lending almost halved from 2010 levels to €2.5 billion in 2011, and eased to €1.0 billion in H1 2012.
New loans to SMEs (excluding financial intermediation and property related loans) drawn down
remained around €2.2 billion in 2010 and 2011, yet slowed somewhat in Q1 2012 to €0.4 billion,
sufficient to keep outstanding credit to these SMEs stable at about €27 billion since late 2010. An
ECB survey finds 25 percent of Irish SMEs identify access to finance as the most pressing concern in
the six months to March 2012, the third highest in the euro area. Nonetheless, the rejection rate for
Irish SME credit applications of 17 percent is only modestly above the euro area average of
13 percent, and is driven by a particularly high rate (38 percent) for micro enterprises (1–9
employees). A domestic survey covering the same period with broader enterprise coverage in
Ireland found that of the 38 percent of SMEs seeking credit, 28 percent of requests were declined
(excluding pending applications). The Credit Review Office, which is available to review such
rejections, has ruled that credit be granted in 60 percent of cases referred to it, and it suggests that
banks better assess performance fundamentals in processing SME credit applications.
13.
Bank funding pressures have
eased recently and deleveraging
targets have been met. Corporate and
household deposits have stabilized, but
attracting deposits has come at the cost
of high interest rates. Although there are
some signs of an easing of deposit rates
in recent months, they remain high
relative to the euro area average. Banks’
deleveraging has continued to progress
largely as planned under the Prudential
Liquidity Assessment Review (PLAR) of
early 2011, with €42 billion achieved by
end April out of an indicative three-year
target of €70 billion. Together these
developments allowed banks to taper
down their reliance on ECB financing: by
mid-2012, ECB refinancing of the
domestic banks was back to the
pre-turmoil level.

The three PCAR banks continue to be well capitalized but their restructuring efforts
have not yet generated concrete improvements in financial performance (Box 1).5 With equity
increased by €24 billion in 2011, average core tier 1 regulatory capital stood at 16½ percent of riskweighted assets as of Q1 2012. However, preprovision profits turned negative in Q1 2012, at minus
0.1 percent (annualized) of total average assets, down from 0.2 percent in 2011. Five main issues
depress bank revenue generation: (i) a large legacy overhang of tracker mortgages indexed to (low)
policy rates; (ii) high fees on the Eligible Liabilities Guarantee (ELG) Scheme; (iii) foregone interest on
impaired loans; (iv) high operational costs; and (v) the high interest cost of deposits and covered
bond funding issued to date. These factors highlight the need to work out sizeable NPLs (21 percent
of gross loans) and for more rapid progress in operational restructuring to reduce costs.
15.
Benefitting from important
assurances from European leaders,
Ireland returned to the sovereign bond
market in July 2012. Developments in Irish
bond spreads since mid 2011 had
suggested the potential for a ―decoupling‖
of Ireland. More recently, the euro area
summit statement of June 29, 2012, which
committed to examine the situation of the
Irish financial sector with the view of further
improving the sustainability of the
well-performing adjustment program, drove
spreads down by 80–100 basis points.
Taking advantage of this opportunity,
Ireland returned to the bond market on
July 26, 2012—for the first time since
September 2010—with a new five-year
issue and a reopened eight-year issue
which together raised €4.2 billion, mostly
subscribed by foreign investors. The
average yield of 5.9 percent was consistent
with a modest premium over the secondary
market. Financing needs in 2013 and 2014
were reduced by a further €1 billion
through a bond swap.

Box 1. PCAR Banks’ Financial Performance, Q1 2012
The financial performance of the PCAR banks remained weak in Q1 2012. While the banks continue to
show high regulatory capital (an average risk-based core tier 1 ratio of 16½ percent), net preprovision
operating profits were negative 0.1 percent of total average assets, down from 1.7 percent in Q4 2011. The
factors that depressed performance during 2011 remain at play:



The already low net interest margin fell by 40 basis points in Q1, to 0.8 percent of average assets.
Though funding costs fell by 35 percent from Q4 2011 reflecting the actions of a leading bank to lower
deposit rates, this was not enough to compensate for weakening interest income due to higher loan
impairments and the drag from low yielding tracker mortgages.



The ELG fee remained high, at 110 basis points in Q1, absorbing some 40 percent of the net interest
margin (up from 28 percent in Q4 2011).



Fee income declined to a very low 0.3 percent of average assets, following the contraction in
underlying economic activity, and covering only about one-quarter of banks’ operating costs.



Already high operating costs remained at 1.1 percent of average assets, consuming 1.3 times the
banks’ net interest margin in Q1. Cost rationalization efforts are underway, with staff reductions of
about 3,400 full-time equivalents anticipated by end 2013.

Other sources of income were small. Nonrecurring items were negligible, and trading gains fell to
negative 0.1 percent in Q1 2012. Staff estimates that the underlying cash flow from operations currently
runs at minus €1.1 billion annually (after adjusting noncash revenue for the unwind discount on impaired
loans, about €1 billion per year). In sum, the banks have not achieved profitability and are not positioned to
absorb loan loss provisioning costs. In Q1, they made provisions covering 1.2 percent of assets, leading to a
net income loss of €1 billion and a negative ROA of 1.2 percent.

OUTLOOK—UNCERTAINTIES THREATEN RECOVERY
AND EXIT
16.
Real GDP is expected to grow by about ½ percent in 2012, a significantly slower pace
than in 2011. Net exports should remain the main driver, but with a smaller contribution than in the
past two years as trading partner growth is expected to decelerate from 1.6 percent to 0.7 percent,
although recent data signal some upside potential for exports. Real private consumption is
projected to shrink by a further 1.9 percent as disposable income growth remains weak despite the
supportive impact of lower ECB rates on mortgage interest payments. Gross fixed investment will
likely contract again given domestic and external uncertainties and low lending to SMEs and
households, yet private investment is already very low at 7½ percent of GDP. Weak domestic
demand limits job creation, with the unemployment rate expected to remain at almost 15 percent,
its highest level since 1995. A negative output gap is expected to limit inflation to 1.4 percent, driven
by energy costs and administered prices.
17.
The macroeconomic outlook is based on an external recovery and on restoring over
time a well functioning financial sector (Table 2). Ireland in 2008–10 was no exception to the
international experience of slow

burdens on a declining path; as
stabilizing housing prices in certain areas strengthen demand from the younger cohort of
households with little debt; and as private investment bottoms out. 6 The medium-term growth
projection, for an average of 2¾ percent annual growth in 2014–17, is low in relation to the scale of
underutilized resources. It hinges on continued external recovery to drive export growth averaging
4½ percent—which is modest by historical standards—supported by a revival of domestic demand.
The latter is expected to be a protracted process given the continued yet moderating fiscal
adjustment, with domestic demand growth projected to turn positive only in 2014 and to reach just
2 percent y/y by 2015–17. Exports could outperform this outlook and machinery and equipment
investment could also rebound more substantially in the medium term.

Household consumption, debt, and saving linkages are discussed in Chapter I of the selected issues paper, where a
gradual consumption recovery is consistent with an easing in household debt burdens over time.

2012 ARTICLE IV REPORT

There are, however, a range of interconnected downside risks to this baseline outlook:



Spillovers from the euro crisis. The medium-term growth scenario assumes resolution of the
euro area crisis over the next year. Conversely, an intensification of stresses would impact
Ireland’s growth outlook through exports given the high openness of the economy, and also by
undermining household and business confidence and domestic spending. Adverse effects on
debt trajectories and on financial sector health could also result in higher Irish spreads and
rating downgrades, thwarting market access.



Domestic demand and the banks. The eventual gradual resumption of private consumption
and investment growth—now not expected until 2014—hinges on a bottoming out of house
prices, some pick up in lending to SMEs and the less indebted younger cohort of households,
well targeted private debt restructurings, and a sense that the crisis is being overcome. Slower
progress on these issues, meshed with concerns about the stability of the euro area, would risk
unleashing a renewed pernicious cycle of falling confidence, declining demand, rising
unemployment, and renewed asset price declines, with bank capital needs emerging if this stress
is lasting.



Unemployment. Gradual economic recovery and slow job creation could imply higher structural
unemployment, limiting potential growth over the medium-term, while persistent high youth
unemployment could risk sustained high emigration.

19.
If these risks to growth materialize, the effect on the fragile public debt path would
be profound, with adverse implications for Europe (Table 1 and Annex II). In the current baseline,
gross general government debt peaks at 119 percent of GDP in 2013—slightly lower than previously
projected given upward revisions to nominal GDP data—and then declines to 108 percent of GDP by
2017. This debt outlook limits

Robust implementation of the June 29 euro area summit statement could markedly
improve Ireland’s debt dynamics and prospects for sustained market financing. The ESM’s
bank recapitalization instrument is key to improving sustainability and to addressing the euro area
leaders’ imperative of breaking the vicious cycle between banks and sovereigns. If, for illustrative
purposes, the ESM invested €24 billion in the banks (the full value of the bank equity increase under
the EU-IMF supported program), and the government used the proceeds towards debt reduction,
government debt would drop 14½ percentage points to 105 percent of GDP in 2013. Market
perceptions of the banks would benefit as ESM equity broke banks’ links to the sovereign,
enhancing the value of the banks and their potential to support economic recovery. The other main

POLICY DISCUSSIONS—WORKING TOWARD
ECONOMIC REVIVAL
21.
The key medium-term challenge is to promote sustained recovery amidst ongoing
fiscal consolidation and private sector deleveraging. Recent growth has been export-led,
benefiting from early competitiveness gains, but sustained recovery will increasingly require a job
creating domestic demand revival. Hence the consultation focused on:


How to get the financial sector to a point where it will step up and lend to credit constrained but
creditworthy borrowers.



The design of fiscal consolidation with regard to both the phasing and composition of measures
to mute adverse growth effects and limit risks to achievability.



Heading off higher structural unemployment that would constrain growth potential.

The analysis is supported by a Selected Issues volume comprising four chapters: (i) household
deleveraging and consumption; (ii) lending to SMEs and households; (iii) the medium-term fiscal
strategy; and (iv) approaches to counter structural unemployment.7

A. Building a Healthy Financial Sector and Reviving Domestic Demand
22.
At end March 2011, the CBI completed a comprehensive assessment of the capital and
liquidity conditions and needs of domestic banks. This Financial Measures Programme served to
much reduce market uncertainties through robust analysis and a high degree of transparency, with
bond yields and spreads declining notably. It comprised:


The PCAR stress test, which assessed the capital needs of four domestic banks (now merged
into three) under a baseline scenario and a stringent three-year stress scenario. These tests
identified the additional capital required to meet minimum core tier 1 capital ratios of
10½ percent in the baseline and 6 percent in the stress scenario. Including a significant buffer
on top of the stress test results, the PCAR found a further €24 billion was required to ensure
sound capitalization of the banks.



An independent loan loss forecasting exercise, performed by BlackRock Solutions. These loss
forecasts, which were notably more conservative than those of the banks, were the foundation
for the assessment of capital needs in the PCAR.



The PLAR deleveraging plan, which set targets for banks participating in the PCAR to reduce
their leverage and reliance on central bank funding.

23.
At the same time, the authorities laid out a comprehensive reform strategy for the
banks.8 The aim was to put the banking system on a firm footing for the future so that it would
support economic recovery. Accordingly, rather than just recapitalizing the banks, the authorities’
considered it important to reorganize them and deleverage (downsize) their balance sheets, to
better serve the needs of the Irish economy. Thus the three-year deleveraging process would not
only address the excessive scale of bank assets, it would also be part of the restructuring to focus
the banks on their core operations, and would do so in a way that avoided fire sales. Much progress
has been made in implementing this three pronged strategy, with recapitalization complete and
deleveraging well advanced (Table 2).9

7

Staff also confirmed that there have been no changes to Ireland’s exchange system since the last Article IV
consultation in July 2010. Ireland maintains an exchange system free of restrictions on payments and transfers for
current international transactions (see Informational Annex).
8

See Minister’s Statement on Banking Matters.

9

Underpinning the progress in reforming the banking system, the authorities put in place a permanent bank
resolution framework in October 2011 (see Box 2 in Ireland—Fourth Review Under the Extended Arrangement). This
framework, which implements a key recommendation of the 2010 Article IV consultation, initially exists in parallel
with an emergency regime adopted during the crisis that is expected to be phased out by end 2012.

Progress
The first stages of this strategy were delivered swiftly. The first pillar was created
around Bank of Ireland, and the second pillar by merging Allied Irish Banks and EBS.
Anglo Irish Bank and Irish Nationwide Building Society, the failed banks, were merged
to form the Irish Bank Resolution Company (IBRC).
Irish Life & Permanent Group was restructured to separate Irish Life, the life
assurance and fund management unit, from Permanent TSB (PTSB), the bank, with
the former bought by the state to finalize the recapitalization of the latter. 1/
The restructuring of PTSB is proceeding, with three separate business units being
established: a core retail bank, an asset management unit, and the U.K. mortgage
loan book (Capital Home Loans).
Institutional arrangements were put in place in mid 2011. The Department of Finance
has established a banking division, whose role and interaction with the CBI was
defined in a memorandum of understanding. Relationship frameworks detailing the
nature and modalities of the (arm’s-length) interaction with the banks have been
adopted and published.

Banks were asked to forecast their financial statements through end 2013. An
independent third party, BlackRock Solutions, estimated future losses on banks’
portfolios, and the CBI overlaid additional conservative assumptions.
This exercise generated aggregate recapitalization needs of €24 billion, with equity
injections completed in June 2012. The total cost to the state was limited to
€17.8 billion (including the purchase of Irish Life), through capital raising from private
investors and burden sharing with subordinated debtholders.
The PCAR exercise will be re-run in concert with the European Banking Authority’s
next euro area stress test exercise.
Core and noncore assets were delineated. Core assets are those principally serving
the needs of the Irish economy and thus needing to be supported by stable funding
even as reliance on ECB financing is reduced. Noncore assets principally consist of
foreign claims to be disposed or run off.
The initial overarching yardstick of the deleveraging plan was to reduce loan-todeposit ratios from 180 percent in the aggregate at end 2010 to no more than
122½ percent by end 2013. Banks identified €70 billion of assets at the outset, of
which more than half have been disposed or amortized.
Overall, deleveraging has advanced faster than planned, in some cases owing to
frontloaded disposals by banks, but also to a stronger-than-anticipated run off of
core asset portfolios reflecting writeoffs and lackluster credit demand.

24.
Creating the conditions for robust credit flow in support of sustained economic
recovery is, nonetheless, a difficult challenge requiring deep and sustained reform efforts. In
view of the progress already made, and in light of financial market developments, a number of
interrelated challenges are now key priorities:


Arresting the deterioration in asset quality is essential. As residential mortgage arrears rose
during 2011, the CBI stepped in appropriately to identify operational weaknesses in banks’
management of distressed credit and to require the banks to develop mortgage arrears
resolution strategies. Banks are now accelerating work to build credit collection and workout
functions. Similar supervision of workout efforts for loans to SMEs has begun, and should
proceed apace considering the importance of this sector for job creation. The authorities also
recently introduced to parliament a comprehensive reform of the personal insolvency framework
to help address borrower financial distress while maintaining debt service discipline, which will
provide an important backstop to bilateral efforts to resolve distressed loans.10 Nonetheless,
progress with loan workout and resolution has not advanced as rapidly as would be desirable.
Consistent implementation and close monitoring of these combined efforts are essential to
enable a much needed transition toward long-term solutions tailored to borrowers in difficulty.
In parallel, it will be important to ensure that the repossession framework works efficiently in
practice so that it complements the personal insolvency reforms.



Regaining profitability is necessary for banks to sustain new lending. As discussed, interest
margins are compressed by high deposit interest rates and guarantee fees. It is now appropriate
to begin phasing out the ELG Scheme in an orderly manner while preserving access to funding.
Moreover, banks remain burdened by cost structures that are too high; in this sense the
reorganization of banks remains to be completed. Plans to reduce operational expenses will
need to be fully implemented in a timely manner, and progress in achieving reasonable cost-toincome ratios should be reviewed periodically.



Banks’ funding also remains a constraint on lending that needs to be addressed. The
current strategy to regain bank access to market funding rests on a combination of
strengthened capital, improved liquidity through deleveraging, loan restructuring to clarify asset
values and reduce arrears, and operational restructuring and other measures to restore
profitability. There have been positive funding developments, with the Irish deposit base
recovering somewhat recently, and banks have obtained repo funding secured on U.K. collateral.
However, in common with banks in other euro area countries, accessing material volumes of
secured market funding to support new lending faces difficulties. In addition, there are now
increased risks of losses from deleveraging, with much of the banks’ more attractive foreign
assets already sold and deleveraging by European banks on the rise. In the absence of viable
funding alternatives, banks may be unable to avoid increased reliance on Eurosystem funding
when further bond maturities occur. This would result in substantial encumbrance of banks’
assets, and renewed reliance on ELA if ECB-eligible collateral is exhausted, limiting potential
market funding. These circumstances undermine prospects for a revival of lending, and a
sustainable solution will need to be found for the euro area as a whole.

10

An overview of the new regime is in Box 2 of Ireland—Fifth Review Under the Extended Arrangement.

2012 ARTICLE IV REPORT

A further concern is that prevailing high economic uncertainty will leave even a well capitalized
banking system reluctant to lend. While lack of aggregate demand is critical to low investment
and credit, there appear to be some pockets of creditworthy but credit constrained borrowers,
notably in the SME sector.11 Staff therefore supported the roll out of a small Temporary Partial
Credit Guarantee Scheme, through which the state will guarantee 75 percent of creditors’
exposure, up to €150 million annually.

25.
The authorities broadly agreed with the thrust of the analysis on the main challenges
in restoring a healthy flow of credit to the economy. They considered the financial sector reform
strategy adopted in March 2011 to have proven its effectiveness in restoring financial stability, which
was critical to stabilizing the economy. At the same time, they agreed that further work was needed
to ensure the financial system can return to healthy operation. Improving the quality of bank assets
is a key priority for the authorities, and one that is being addressed through a combination of
supervisory measures and the reform of household bankruptcy, where sound implementation is
both resource intensive and time consuming. In particular, the authorities are alert to the need for
careful implementation of the personal insolvency reforms. The authorities noted that they are
developing a roadmap to wean banks off the ELG Scheme while preserving financial stability, and
are supporting the implementation by banks of restructuring plans to reduce operational costs. On
funding, the authorities indicated they would continue to assist banks in developing collateral
quality to increase the scope for market funding, yet noted that reviving bank funding markets is a
broader challenge for the euro area.

This major consolidation was achieved during a deep economic slump while preserving
social cohesion and protecting key public services and the most vulnerable. Political
commitment to consolidation has been a welcome constant, as reflected in the affirmation by the
new government (which took office in March 2011) of the medium-term fiscal targets in the EU–IMF
supported program agreed in December 2010. An agreement with the public service following the
2009–10 pay cuts (the ―Croke Park Agreement‖) stipulated that future savings would be achieved
through voluntary retirements and redundancies, rather than cuts in pay, and that the public service
would be flexible in redeploying staff in order to protect services. The June 2012 Progress Report of
the CPA Implementation Body found that significant targeted reductions in the wage bill had been
achieved in the second year of the agreement, while protecting public services. The progressive
design of the consolidation, together with strong social protection, has helped Ireland retain the
second-lowest relative at-risk-of-poverty gap in Europe in 2010, despite suffering a deeper crisis
(Box 2).
29.
With the overall deficit expected
to still exceed 8 percent of GDP in 2012,
significant further consolidation is
required over the medium term. The
Medium-Term Fiscal Statement (November
2011) set out the parameters for a 5 percent
of GDP consolidation over 2013–15 to
deliver a deficit of 3 percent of GDP in 2015.
The quantum, phasing, and objective of this
consolidation is broadly appropriate. At the
same time, given the fragility of Ireland’s
economic recovery, should any significant
additional consolidation need be identified in

Box 2. The Impact of the Crisis on Poverty and Inequality
Ireland has avoided a decline in poverty rates relative to Europe despite facing a deeper
economic slump. Ireland’s at-risk-of poverty (ARP) threshold—set at 60 percent of median
equivalized household disposable income—was above the EU average (left panel) in both 2006 and
2010. The share of population below the ARP threshold fell from 18.5 percent in 2006 to 16.1
percent in 2010, just below the EU average (center panel). Moreover, at 15.3 percent, Ireland’s 2010
relative poverty gap (percent deviation of ARP threshold from the median income of those below it)
is the second lowest in Europe (right panel). Overall, Ireland’s strong social supports have avoided a
rise in poverty during the crisis.

While some recent data has raised concerns about rising inequality, this may partly reflect
sampling variations, as budget consolidation has been progressive overall to date. Recent data
from the Survey on Income and Living Conditions showed a rise in the ratio of net disposable
income in the top quintile to that in the bottom quintile from 4.4 to 5.3 between 2008 and 2010
(slightly above the EU average of 5.0). However, sample composition changes were large, with half
the respondents being new. Measured inequality may have increased because self-employed
people—who typically receive few social transfers—moved disproportionately into the bottom
quintile, while large one-off retirement and redundancy payments were included in social transfers.
Indeed, the ESRI finds the cumulative budgetary consolidation over 2009–12 has been progressive,
with the exception perhaps of the 2012 standard VAT rate increase, although this only applied to
half of consumption, as many essentials are zero-rated.

future updates of the Statement, this should be spread over outer years (2014–15) while still
reaching the medium-term fiscal goal.13 The plan envisages a continuation of the expenditure-led
approach (maintaining the two-thirds share), which can be justified given Ireland’s now fourthhighest primary expenditure ratio in the OECD (as a share of GNP), and given the opportunities for
savings discussed below. In addition, maintaining a freeze on nominal wage and welfare rates is
expected to generate a further reduction in the expenditure ratio of about half 3½ percentage
points of GDP by 2015.
30.
Nonetheless, even with the authorities’ strong capacity to deliver, risks to reaching
these consolidation goals remain. The authorities’ track record of delivering against plans, and a
robust new framework of tri-annual spending reviews and multi-annual nominal expenditure
ceilings, support the achievement of the expenditure-led consolidation. However, after several
successive years of adjustment, few low-hanging fruit are left. Evidence from past European
consolidations, especially the recent Latvian experience, suggests that expenditure reductions
become progressively more difficult in later phases of consolidation, or when key services begin to
be affected.14 Moreover, a weaker than expected growth recovery would erode savings from the
nominal wage and welfare rate freeze, while the demographic outlook will put significant upward
pressure on pension, education, and health spending over the medium to longer term.15
31.
In these difficult circumstances, a strategic approach that keeps all high-quality
expenditure and revenue options on the table is needed to complete the consolidation in a
durable manner.16 Given the still-fragile economy and high unemployment, it is vital that the choice
of budget measures minimizes the drag on demand and job creation. At the same time, the
measures need to entail fair burden-sharing across income groups, generations and family types,
while effectively protecting the most vulnerable. To achieve these goals, staff encouraged the
authorities to base fiscal consolidation on the following approaches:


Better targeting the state’s social supports and subsidies to ensure support is directed to
those who need it;



Reforming key government services, especially health and education; and



Focusing revenue effort on base-broadening rather than rate hikes.

To best achieve a growth-friendly and fair consolidation, which is more likely to endure, staff
recommended to not to rule out any high-quality expenditure or revenue options, some of which
may be needed as fallbacks in case any shortfalls arise.

13

The authorities expect to update this statement in October 2012, in preparation for Budget 2013.

32.
While ensuring the most vulnerable are protected, comprehensive targeting of
spending can deliver timely spending reductions. Maintaining expensive universal supports and
subsidies is difficult to justify under present budgetary circumstances. Better targeting of spending,
including the child benefit, medical cards, the household benefits package, and subsidies on college
fees, can generate significant immediate savings and contain demographic related spending
pressures over the longer term, while effectively protecting the poor.17 In the case of some universal
benefits such targeting could be achieved by making them taxable. State pensions have been
exempted from the adjustment to date, yet a targeted reduction should also be considered given
the broad decline in consumer prices, especially in view of the expected 3 percent annual growth in
the eligible population. One approach would be to reduce or eliminate the premium—currently 5
percent—on the contributory pension over the means-tested pension. While recognizing the
benefits of the Croke Park agreement for industrial peace, the public sector paybill remains high,
and staff urged continued monitoring of the adequacy of savings in the net public pay and pensions
bill and of public service provision.18
33.
In parallel, reforms of key public services are needed to underpin savings in the
medium term. Despite spending significantly more than the OECD average on health and
education, Ireland’s performance indicators are around the OECD average. Moreover the spending
pressures in health during 2012 appear to have structural roots. Deeper reforms in health and higher
education are therefore needed, by identifying service priorities and delivering them more
efficiently. In health, potential reforms could include new working models to minimize premium and
overtime payments, greater use of primary care rather than hospital stays, and substantially
increasing the currently low share of generic drug use. Similarly, a new funding model for higher
education can deliver broad access to high quality education without additional public investment
by (i) better taking into account skills priorities in course availability, and linking college fees to the
costs and earnings potential of courses while supporting low income students through affordable
loans and grants, and (ii) striking the appropriate balance between degree and vocational education.
While savings from such reforms can take time to realize, they are important to help ensure the
consolidation can be sustained by enabling the growing needs for these services to be met at
manageable cost.
34.
A base-broadening approach to raising revenue will help mitigate potential adverse
growth effects. Relative to other OECD economies, Ireland has a combination of high personal and
indirect tax rates and relatively narrow tax bases.19 This provides considerable room to raise
revenues without increasing the already elevated marginal tax rates, and while also avoiding higher
effective rates on lower income workers that could undermine work incentives. For example, special
income tax reliefs—which currently benefit only those employees earning above the high entry
point for income tax—could be better targeted to low-income taxpayers, and options to broaden
17

The 2011 combined spending on these items was about 3½ percent of GDP.

18

For a recent staff analysis of the public wage bill, see Box 5 in Ireland—Sixth Review under the Extended
Arrangement – IMF Staff Report.
19
Due to very high entry points for income tax and employee PRSI, and despite elevated marginal rates for those
around the average wage, Ireland’s effective PIT rates are quite low for persons earning up to 167 percent of average
wage. Similarly, due to several lower-tier rates, the relatively-high 23 percent standard VAT rate currently applies to
just half of consumption.

23

the PRSI base could be examined. The planned introduction of a value-based property tax in 2013
will provide a progressive and stable source of revenue. A suitably high level for this tax—where
staff favored around the 0.5 percent mark—would help maximize these benefits. There is also scope
to expand the well designed carbon tax to all fuel types, and to redesign vehicle taxes in a way that
can provide significantly higher revenues, while fully preserving incentives for environmental
conservation.
35.
The authorities agreed that further fiscal consolidation would be more difficult and
concurred with much of the thrust of the staff’s analysis. They emphasized that improving
prospects for growth and job creation was critical, including to make the necessary budget
adjustments more tolerable, and there were also significant positive implications for the public
finances. The authorities generally concurred that all high-quality expenditure and revenue options
needed to be kept on the table in order to deliver the consolidation in a durable manner, while also
highlighting the range of savings options that had been identified in the 2011 Comprehensive
Expenditure Review, on which the government would be able to draw. At the same time, the
authorities emphasized the benefits of the Croke Park Agreement in delivering a leaner and more
effective public service, while maintaining industrial peace. The authorities also noted the
importance of calibrating social transfers to budgetary resources, labor market developments and
demographic pressures. Regarding reforms of public services, the authorities agreed there is scope
for savings, such as via greater use of generic drugs and primary care in health, and in improved
procurement more generally.

C. Supporting Growth and Reducing Unemployment
36.
In recent years, the Irish authorities have undertaken a range of reforms aimed at
boosting medium-term growth and reducing unemployment. The main elements of these
reforms have included:


Reforms of sheltered sectors: The authorities introduced two bills to the Oireachtas in the
autumn of 2011 to improve competition in the legal and medical services sectors. The Legal
Services Regulation Bill aims to increase transparency on legal costs, better protect
customers, and create independent oversight bodies for professional misconduct and
disputes over legal costs. Margins on pharmaceuticals were reduced and other legislation
would make it easier for general practitioners to obtain contracts under the General Medical
Services Scheme.



Improving competition enforcement: The Competition (Amendment) Act 2012 came into
effect in July 2012 with the aim of strengthening enforcement of competition law. In
addition, the authorities have recently increased the resources of the Competition Authority
by about 25 percent.



Strengthening labor activation and training: The Pathways to Work initiative, adopted in
February 2012, sets out a strategy to improve activation and training policies for the
unemployed by (i) intensifying engagement between jobseekers and employment services,
(ii) better aligning the provision of training with labor market needs, (iii) establishing

24

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

IRELAND

2012 ARTICLE IV REPORT

effective enforcement mechanisms to ensure that jobseekers comply with activation and
training requirements; (iv) strengthening links with employers to ensure a higher share of
vacancies is filled by persons registered as unemployed; and (v) reforming institutions to
deliver better services to the unemployed.


Facilitating labor market adjustment: Sectors covered by Employment Regulation Orders
(EROs) and Registered Employment Agreements (REAs) were hit hard by the crisis, yet wage
adjustment was limited.20 Moreover, a High Court ruling in July 2011 found sections of the
legislation related to EROs to be unconstitutional. Accordingly, the authorities published a
draft Industrial Relations (Amendment) Bill in December 2011, which following amendments
in June, was signed into law in July 2012. Appropriately, the reform requires greater focus on
economic conditions and competitiveness in wage setting, better safeguards employment in
circumstances where the employer is unable to pay, and allows REAs to more readily be
reviewed, challenged and cancelled. It also streamlines EROs by allowing for fewer sectors
with EROs and a lower number of minimum wages set in each ERO, and by excluding
employment conditions covered in other legislation. e.g., the Sunday pay rate. Next steps
include a formal review of all EROs before re-negotiation under the new legislation can
occur, most likely starting in 2013.

37.
Against this backdrop, staff focused on policies to increase the potential for an
employment-rich recovery and to contain structural unemployment.21 Although economic
recovery will be the main vehicle to reduce unemployment, it is important to help ensure that the
recovery is job-rich, and that jobseekers are willing and able to fill positions when they become
available.
38.
Education and training policies will be crucial to facilitate mobility of the unemployed
to other sectors for the economy. Given the high share of unemployed persons with lower
educational attainment, and the expectation that formerly booming sectors will only partially
recover, there is a need to improve skills among the unemployed to facilitate the inter-sectoral
reallocation of labor. Hence staff considered that:


Expansion of return-to-education programs like Youthreach, Back to Education, or
Springboard is especially important, as short-term courses might be insufficient to provide
jobseekers with marketable skills.

20

EROs, prepared by Joint Labor Committees (a government-appointed chairman and representatives of workers and
firms) applied mostly to low-skill sectors such as retail, catering, and accommodation and set minimum wages for the
sector (10 percent above the national minimum wage on average) as well as other employment conditions, such has
overtime or Sunday rates. REAs are collective agreements registered with the Labor Court, which then became legally
binding on the individual firm, or—in case of industry-wide agreements (mainly in construction and electrical
contracting)—for all employees and workers in the sector. EROs and REAs cover approximately 23 percent of private
sector workers (Report of the Independent Review of Employment Regulation Orders and Registered Employment
Agreement Wage Setting Mechanisms, 2011).
21
Averting structural unemployment is discussed in Chapter IV of the selected issues paper.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

IRELAND



Course provision should be increasingly driven by effectiveness in meeting labor
market needs. To achieve that, training outcomes should be evaluated on a regular basis,
and the assessment results should be the key element in the decision process to expand or
close the courses. In this respect, timely creation of the new authorities for further education
and training (SOLAS and the Education and Training Boards) should be considered a priority,
and the authorities could consider the introduction of a voucher system for courses.



Reform of the Community Employment (CE) scheme should be considered. Before it was
moved to the Department of Social Protection, CE used to consume more than half of the
training resources of the Irish National Training and Employment Authority. While a well
designed public works program can help preserve jobseekers links with the labor market in
an environment of depressed labor demand, it is important to ensure that over time entry to
the scheme is limited to jobseekers without other employment possibilities. Moreover,
participants should receive suitable training that will help them secure employment after
their exit from the scheme.

39.
Enhancing resources to help the long-term unemployed get back into the workforce is
also needed. Staff strongly supported the direction of reforms of activation policies under the
Pathways to Work initiative and encouraged sustained implementation effort in this area. Reform of
welfare payments to avoid unemployment and inactivity traps, and reviews of PRSI on low-incomes
and of minimum wages, also warrant consideration to maximize the employment benefits of
economic recovery. In particular:


Private provision of employment services. The number of employment services staff with
case worker training is low relative to the number of unemployed, which may impede more
active engagement, so additional well trained case workers are needed. Involving private
sectors firms with the provision of activation services should be considered, especially for
the long-term unemployed, though international experience indicates careful design of such
arrangements is crucial.



Principle of mutual obligation. To ensure jobseekers meet their obligations to actively
seek employment and improve their skills and qualifications so as to reenter the labor
market, it is critical to strictly apply the system of sanctions for jobseekers that are not
complying with activation and training requirements.



Welfare benefits. The flat structure of unemployment payments results in replacement rates
for the long-term unemployed that are high by international standards. The highest
replacement rates affect those also receiving housing benefits, resulting in unemployment
and inactivity traps that lower exit rates from unemployment, making it especially important
to reform to reform the structure of social payments in this area.

Labor costs. Almost 9 percent of the work force, or over 60 percent of the unemployed,
have been out of work for over a year. In these circumstances, it is important to maximize
opportunities to regain access to the job ladder. One step would be to retain the reduced
rate of PRSI for the lowest pay

considered given the broad fall in
consumer prices including rents in recent years, and because it is notably above the
minimum wage in Northern Ireland and the United Kingdom despite the highly integrated
labor market. Nonetheless, with jobseeker payments at about 62 percent of the NMW
(assuming a 35 hour work week), there are limits to reductions given the need to ensure the
NMW provides adequate incentives to take up employment.

40.
The authorities consider the reduction of unemployment a core priority. The Pathways
to Work project is a major endeavor across a range of government bodies, and the authorities
emphasized their full commitment to making the sustained effort needed to achieve a modern and
effective approach to engaging with the unemployed and addressing their training and other needs
to help them return to work. At the same time, they had no immediate plan to materially reform
Community Employment, which played an important role in local communities. Regarding resources
for employment services, they were considering how these needs could best be met, including the
potential role for the private sector, where they had researched experience in Australia and the
United Kingdom. The authorities noted they had identified issues in the structure of welfare
payments, which are limited to a relatively small group of long-term unemployed also receiving
housing supplements, and that the Housing Assistance Payment would address those incentive
concerns. The authorities noted that as a share of average and median wages, Ireland’s minimum
wage was not so high when compared with other countries, and that both coalition partners in the
government had agreed to reverse an earlier reduction in the national minimum wage, so the
authorities were not planning to review this matter.

STAFF APPRAISAL
41.
In the wake of an exceptionally deep banking crisis, the Irish authorities’ steadfast
efforts have restored policy credibility. Determined actions have been taken to restructure,
downsize, and recapitalize banks at a cumulative public cost of some 40 percent of GDP. Budgetary
efforts have necessarily been substantial but social cohesion has been maintained through careful
design and sound implementation of fiscal measures. Together with strong support from European
partners, and expectations of a further strengthening of that support, these efforts have helped
rebuild confidence as demonstrated by the recent successful return to the sovereign bond market.
The underlying strengths of Ireland’s highly open economy allowed a return to growth in 2011 even
as domestic demand continued to decline.
42.
Risks to the economic outlook remain substantial nonetheless. The origin of Ireland’s
crisis lay in debts accumulated to support the banking system, yet public debt remains high and
continues to grow. The banking system is still in the process of restructuring its assets and
operations, and is not yet meeting the financing needs of the economy. Households are dealing with
high debts and depleted net wealth and some face deep financial distress. High unemployment
plays a key role in such distress, and it also undermines skills and drives emigration. Small and
medium enterprises bear the brunt of weak domestic demand and also have debt distress and some
face more limited access to credit. The euro area crisis creates uncertainty for both financial markets
and fixed investment. In these circumstances, the risks to economic recovery remain high, with
profound implications for debt sustainability, including through potential effects on bank health if
weak growth were to persist.
43.
Ireland must continue to deliver on the many difficult steps needed to underpin a
sustained economic recovery. Fiscal consolidation remains a necessary condition for sustainable
growth, but needs to be conducted in as growth-friendly manner as feasible. To best support
growth during this consolidation a revival of domestic demand must be facilitated, while also
enhancing competitiveness and the readiness of the unemployed to take up jobs, as an employment
intensive recovery is needed to reduce unacceptably high unemployment.
44.
Deep and sustained financial sector reform efforts are needed to restore banks’ ability
to support sound credit and revive domestic demand. The authorities have forcefully
implemented their strategy to reorganize, recapitalize, and downsize the banking system, yet bank
lending and profitability remain weak. A key remaining challenge is to arrest the deterioration in
bank asset quality, where progress with loan workout and resolution has not advanced as rapidly as
would be desirable. Ongoing supervisory pressure is needed for timely development of long-term
solutions for distressed households, and to closely monitor their implementation over time.
Intensive pursuit of a similar approach for loans to SMEs is important given their critical role in job
creation. Reforms of the personal insolvency framework are key to help address borrower financial
distress while maintaining debt service discipline and it will be important to ensure that the
repossession framework complements these reforms in practice.
45.
Returning the banks to profitability is needed for a lasting revival of lending, where
breaking sovereign-bank linkages would greatly assist this process. Reducing funding and
operational costs are needed to return the banks to profitability, and banks’ plans to reduce

28

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

IRELAND

2012 ARTICLE IV REPORT

operational expenses must be fully implemented. Developing a roadmap to phase out the costly
ELG Scheme in an orderly manner, while preserving access to funding, is appropriate. However, with
limited viable funding alternatives, banks may continue to face high deposit rates. Temporary
ownership of the banks by the ESM could overcome this hurdle, and by eliminating the need for
guarantees and increasing access to other funding options, banks’ profitability and value could be
much improved. In the process, their capacity to provide sound lending could be restored more
quickly, supporting Ireland’s recovery.
46.
Substantial further fiscal consolidation is needed, and a combination of strategies can
help limit the impact on growth while protecting public services and the vulnerable. Careful
targeting of spending is needed to deliver more immediate savings while ensuring supports and
subsidies are directed to those who need them, where making benefits taxable is an option in some
cases. State pensions are one area where targeted savings can be found, while further reductions in
public sector wages cannot be excluded if wage bill targets cannot be met while ensuring adequate
public services. Medium-term savings will entail deeper reforms of core government services,
especially health and education, where service priorities must be identified, and reforms designed to
deliver those services more efficiently so growing needs can be met at manageable cost. The Croke
Park agreement can serve an important role in facilitating the timely implementation of these
reforms. There is considerable scope for further base broadening measures to raise revenues while
containing the drag on growth, and the introduction of a value-based property tax is important as a
progressive and stable source of revenue.
47.
Reducing unemployment requires firm implementation of a broad based approach.
Although economic recovery will be the main vehicle to reduce unemployment, it is also important
to ensure that jobseekers are willing and able to fill jobs when they become available. Realizing the
full benefits of the Pathways to Work initiative will require additional well trained case workers to
support jobseekers get back into employment, where involving private sector firms, especially for
the long-term unemployed, could also play a useful role if well designed. Facilitating the mobility of
jobseekers needs regular monitoring of training outcomes and effective delivery of further
education and training. Reforming the structure of social benefits can support this strategy,
especially by avoiding unemployment and inactivity traps for the long-term unemployed that are
also receiving housing benefits, and other steps to reduce labor costs and promote a job-rich
recovery should be explored.
48.
The prospects for these efforts to succeed hinge on stabilization and recovery across
the euro area and strengthened European support. Ireland’s small open economy has regained
much of the competitiveness it lost during the boom, yet high trade and financial openness implies
reliance on a revival of trading partner growth and calmer euro area financial conditions. Euro area
leaders have pledged to break the vicious circle between banks and sovereigns by enabling the ESM
to recapitalize banks directly, to treat similar cases equally, and to examine the situation of the Irish
financial sector with the view of further improving the sustainability of Ireland’s well-performing
adjustment program. Meeting these commitments is critical to improving Ireland’s debt
sustainability and reviving sound lending, as stepping stones to ensuring Ireland’s economic
recovery and durable return to private financing.
49.

The next Article IV consultation with Ireland is expected to take place on a 24-month cycle.

IRELAND

Annex I. Assessing Ireland’s External Sector Risks 1
Ireland’s external debt is high and the net international investment position (IIP) has reached
negative 100 percent of GDP (though large valuation changes contributed to this deterioration).
While the current account moved into surplus in 2010 and 2011, it did so in an environment of
falling domestic demand which compressed imports. A range of methodologies indicate that the
real effective exchange rate remains moderately overvalued, by around 5–10 percent, and the
unemployment rate of 14.8 percent underscores the need to further improve competitiveness to
support a job-rich recovery.
Net International Investment Position and External Debt
Ireland’s net negative IIP is large. Excluding the IFSC, it deteriorated from about minus
55 percent of GDP in the years to 2007 to minus 92 percent of GDP in 2009 and has remained
around that level since. The level of the net IIP was not regarded as an issue during the boom
because of its moderate size and the collapse in risk premiums prior to the crisis. However, as the
financial crisis started to unfold, the value of Ireland’s gross foreign assets halved, while the
retrenchment in external financing lowered foreign liabilities, though to a smaller extent,
resulting in an enlarged negative net IIP. It is important to note that the extent of the fall in the
net IIP was not matched by the cumulative current account deficit, suggesting that valuation
changes, especially on the foreign assets, may have contributed significantly to the deterioration
(see Lane (2012)). Rising gross government debt added to the negative net position as the Irish
authorities resorted to official funding. The net external liabilities of the CBI also grew, due to an
increased reliance of domestic banks on Eurosytem funding, although most of this substituted
for private wholesale lending, de facto reducing the external risks. At the end of Q1 2012 Ireland’s
gross external debt stood at around 300 percent of GDP, 40 percent of which was official external
debt of the general government and CBI.
Current Account Improvement
Current account adjustment is already underway, albeit in part due to cyclical factors.
Exports have risen 14 percent since 2009, with goods exports registering 9 percent growth, while
services exports increased by over 20 percent. However, declining domestic demand compressed
merchandise imports, which in 2011 stood 15 percent below their pre-crisis peak. As a result, the
current account balance recorded a surplus of 1.1 percent of GDP in 2010 and 2011, significantly
improved from the peak deficits of over 5 percent of GDP in 2007–08.

1

The analysis excludes the International Financial Services Centre (IFSC), which comprises of a broad range of
financial institutions including banks, insurance companies, investment funds, and their support firms, which
provide financial services mostly to nonresidents, constituting a de facto offshore financial center.

Real Exchange Rate Developments
Indicators based on consumer prices and ULCs indicate that the real exchange rate remains
moderately overvalued, although the size of the competitiveness gap is narrowing. Since
the peak in 2008, the CPI-deflated REER fell 17.5 percent while the ULC-deflated REER declined
even more (around 22 percent). Productivity improvements and falling ULCs were the major
factors behind this depreciation, though they came at the cost of significant labor shedding—
some 16 percent since 2008—resulting in an unemployment rate of 14.8 percent. Nominal labor
costs fell by 3 percent since the 2009 peak, which is more significant when compared with the
4½ percent rise in nominal labor costs in the euro area during the same period. The weakening
euro helped as well, given Ireland’s extensive trade links with non-euro area countries (notably,
the United Kingdom and United States).

1/ Changes are with respect to the peak for Ireland which was in 2008-Q2.

However, compositional changes in the economy have led to some overstatement of the
competitiveness improvement by conventional measures. A contraction of a low-productivity
yet high-wage sector (e.g. construction) could lead to an increase in average productivity and a
fall in average wages in the economy even if no changes in other sectors took place. CBI (2011)
estimates that compositional effects could account for 40 percent of the decline in the headline
ULC between 2007 and 2010 (see also O’Brien (2010)).
Real Exchange Rate Assessment
Standard methods of assessing the real exchange rate indicate that it remains moderately
overvalued:


Direct estimation of the deviation from equilibrium of the real exchange rate based on a set
of macroeconomic variables points to 8 percent overvaluation under the CGER2-type
Equilibrium Real Exchange Rate method, and 12 percent overvaluation under External

2012 ARTICLE IV REPORT

IRELAND

Balance Assessment. This is in part due to a modest overvaluation of the euro,
notwithstanding its recent nominal depreciation.


The CGER-type Macrobalance Approach indicates a norm for the current account of a
0.6 percent of GDP deficit. This is below the projected underlying value of the current
account of 2.4 percent of GDP, which the medium-term projection adjusted for any
remaining output gaps. Nonetheless, as the projection allows for a 2.5 percent real exchange
rate depreciation given high unemployment, this approach suggests that the exchange rate
is fairly valued.



A variant on the CGER-type Sustainability Approach would note that a higher current account
balance would be required to unwind the large negative IIP. For example, to reduce the net
IIP liability to a lower level of 35 percent of GDP (the indicative guideline for net foreign
liabilities under the European Commission’s Macroeconomic Imbalance Procedure) in the
next ten years, Ireland would have to run a current account surplus of around 4 percent of
GDP each year. To stabilize the current account balance at this level thereafter would require
additional depreciation, implying around 3.5 percent overvaluation.

Policy implications
Even as the large negative net IIP position is not a pressing source of risk, further
competitiveness gains are important to help accelerate the reduction in unemployment.
The IIP can be expected to improve over time, in part as a result of private saving exceeding
investment in order to reduce private debt, and also as a consequence of continued fiscal
consolidation needed to ensure public debt sustainability. Further improvements in
competitiveness will facilitate this adjustment being achieved with higher overall activity levels.
Setting aside the external sector perspective, there is also a need for further improvements in
competitiveness in order to encourage a job-rich recovery, where strong growth in the tradable
sector is important to compensate for the likelihood that the recovery in domestic demand will
be a protracted process.

IRELAND

Annex II. Debt Sustainability Analysis
This Annex presents the public and external debt sustainability analysis based on staff’s revised
medium-term macroeconomic framework and the Irish authorities’ fiscal consolidation plan.
General Government Debt
The upward revision in nominal GDP has resulted in a lower debt path. An upward revision
of nominal GDP by 1.6 percent in 2011 has lowered the debt ratio by some 1.7 percentage
points.1 Combining the higher 2011 GDP outturn with the slightly lower growth path in staff’s
medium term scenario (see Table 2) reduces the debt ratio by some 0.9 percentage points in the
medium term. Overall, debt is projected to peak at 119 percent in 2013, slightly lower than in the
previous review and some 5 percentage points below the projection at program inception.
While prefinancing has temporarily increased gross debt in 2012, fiscal consolidation will
put debt on a declining path after 2013. The authorities’ decision to prefinance a larger
portion of their 2013 financing needs increases gross debt temporarily by €3.2 billion (2 percent
of GDP). The resulting end 2012 cash buffer is projected to increase to a very strong €18 billion
(11 percent of GDP) before returning to previous levels during 2013.2 Based on the authorities’
continued adherence to their medium-term fiscal plans, the primary deficit is assumed to fall
below the debt stabilizing threshold in 2014. Under the baseline scenario of a deficit declining
towards its 0.5 percent of GDP Medium-Term Objective by 2019, gross general government
debt is projected to fall to 94 percent of GDP by 2021.
Risks to debt sustainability remain high:


Risks to growth are the key concern. A slower economic expansion in the medium term
could easily derail the baseline outlook, with debt rising to 146 percent of GDP by 2021 if
GDP growth were to stagnate at ½ percent per year. Close fiscal-banking linkages could also
cause additional debt-increasing outlays if banks incur additional loan losses under such a
scenario. However, a temporary growth shock remains manageable. If GDP growth
temporarily slowed to only ½ percent in 2013 (vis-à-vis the current projection of 1.4 percent)
before accelerating along the current baseline path, gross general government debt would
instead peak at 120 percent of GDP before declining to 96 percent by 2021.



Contingent liabilities present a sizable risk. Identified contingent liabilities are falling as
the ELG Scheme is phased out. However, as long as the state continues to own large stakes in
the banking system, economic shocks can amplify risks to debt sustainability given the
potential realization of contingent liabilities from banking losses. Other contingent liabilities

the coming years remain subject
to property price and other risks. A standard 10 percent contingent liability shock would
capture one-third of the gross contingent liabilities from NAMA and IBRC, and would impose
a parallel shift on the debt path, taking it to 105 percent of GDP in 2021, compared with
94 percent in the baseline.


Divestments of state participation in the banking sector are an upside risk. No
allowance for ESM equity investments in the banking sector or other bank equity divestments
is made. Similarly, the projections do not allow for the modest state asset disposal program,
as preparations are still underway and half the proceeds are to be reinvested.



Interest rate shocks pose less immediate risks to the debt trajectory. Ireland has a high
share of fixed rate borrowing which shields it from the immediate effect of higher interest
rates. The interest bill is also contained by the fact that one third of the debt stock consists of
official debt at yields below prevailing market rates. The current baseline scenario includes
the effect of higher average interest rates as Ireland returns to market financing at elevated
spreads. An additional shock to the cost of new funding (including short term debt) of 200
basis points would have a negligible impact in the short run. If such a shock was sustained, it
would increase the effective interest rate by 140 basis points in 2021, and debt would decline
more gradually to 101 percent of GDP in 2021.

External Debt
The external debt of the non-IFSC sector continues to decline, though it remains at a very
high level.3 At the end of Q1 2012, it fell to around 300 percent of GDP, from 322 percent of
GDP recorded in 2011.4 This decline mostly represented a continued fall in the external debt of
the Central Bank of Ireland, as Target 2 liabilities declined as banks reduced their reliance on
Eurosystem funding. At the same time, debt of the general government continued to rise as the
authorities drew on the external support under the EU-IMF program, though this increase was
more than offset by falling debt of the other sectors.

3

The discussion focuses on the non-IFSC sector, as the IFSC principally serves nonresidents.

4

This gross debt figure includes debt of large multinational corporations, including both intra-company and
intra-group debt, which is expected to be sizable in Ireland.

2012 ARTICLE IV REPORT

IRELAND

By 2017, external debt is expected to fall to 212 percent of GDP, but this forecast is subject
to substantial downside risks. A macroeconomic scenario at historical averages would not put
the debt-to-GDP ratio on a declining path, bringing the external debt to over 316 percent of GDP
in 2017. A permanent ½ standard deviation shock to growth, implying a renewed recession in
2013 and significantly slower recovery thereafter would raise the medium-term debt-to-GDP
ratio to 239 percent of GDP. A permanent ½ standard deviation shock to the non-IFSC current
account (excluding interest payments) would raise debt by around 22 percentage points
compared to the baseline in the medium term. A standard combined shock of ¼ of the standard
deviation applied to the current account, interest rates, and the GDP growth rate would increase
debt to 241 percent of GDP in the medium term.
Including the IFSC, total external
debt remains very high, at around
1,025 percent of GDP in Q1 2012,
down from 1,075 percent at end
2011. In addition to a reduction in the
non-IFSC debt, the IFSC has reduced its
gross external debt by 27 percentage
points of GDP since end 2011. The net
IIP deteriorated to 100 percent of GDP
as the IFSC’s net IIP position turned
negative, while non-IFSCs reduced their
external exposure.

1/ General government gross debt. The projections include Fund and EU disbursements. Government-guaranteed NAMA bonds are excluded, based on Eurostat guidance. From 2018, no policy change is assumed.
2/ Excluding bank support costs.
3/ Derived as [(r - p(1+g) - g + ae(1+r)]/(1+g+p+gp)) times previous period debt ratio, with r = interest rate; p = growth rate of GDP deflator; g = real GDP growth rate; a = share of foreign-currency denominated debt; and e = nominal exchange rate depreciation (measured by
increase in local currency value of U.S. dollar).
4/ The real interest rate contribution is derived from the denominator in footnote 2/ as r - π (1+g) and the real growth contribution as -g.
5/ The exchange rate contribution is derived from the numerator in footnote 2/ as ae(1+r).
6/ Total bank recapitalization costs net of proceeds, including funds provided by the National Pension Reserve Fund.
7/ For projections, this line includes exchange rate changes.
8/ Defined as public sector deficit, plus amortization of medium and long-term public sector debt and short-term debt at end of previous period, and bank recapitalization costs.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND
IRELAND
Seventh Review Under the Extended Arrangement
Prepared by the European Department
(In consultation with other departments)
Approved by Ajai Chopra and James Roaf
August 21, 2012
Delivery: Half way through their EU-IMF supported program, the Irish authorities
maintain vigorous policy implementation. All performance criteria and indicative targets
for end June were met, and two structural benchmarks were observed. Statements of
stronger European support lowered bond spreads and helped the sovereign return to the
bond market in July, yet major financial sector and fiscal adjustment challenges remain.
Tasks ahead: Two workstreams drive the program toward sustained economic recovery:


Restoring sound credit to revitalize domestic demand. Banks’ arrears management
strategies, on both residential mortgages and SME loans, must be accelerated,
supported by conservative valuation and provisioning norms and the new personal
insolvency bill. Banks also need to be weaned off costly government liability
guarantees and must also cut operating costs to support profitability and lending.



Deepening the credibility of fiscal consolidation. The fiscal responsibility bill, plans
to provide a statutory basis for multi-year expenditure ceilings, and the coming update
of the Medium-Term Fiscal Statement are key steps. Most measures for 2013–15,
including the introduction of a value-based property tax in 2013, should be set out at
the time of Budget 2013. If growth disappoints and significant additional adjustment
needs arise, the latter could be spread over 2014–15 to help protect the recovery.

Euro area summit: Material investments in Irish banks by the ESM could transform the
public debt outlook, cut the bank–sovereign link, and cement a needed win for Europe.
Proposed Decision: Staff supports the authorities’ request for completion of the seventh
review under the extended arrangement. The purchase subject to completion of this
review would be in an amount equivalent to SDR 0.758 billion (about €0.9 billion).
Transparency: The Irish authorities consent to publication of this staff report.

I. BACKGROUND
1.
Half way through Ireland’s EU-IMF supported program, policy implementation
remains vigorous. Despite considerable headwinds stemming from an adverse global
economic outlook and the ongoing EMU crisis, the Irish authorities have pressed forward and
delivered on all key milestones under the program. Fiscal consolidation has continued
steadfastly and significant steps have been taken to reform the financial sector. All
quantitative macroeconomic targets for the program review have been met (MEFP Table 2),
as well as the structural benchmark for end-June 2012 (MEFP Table 1).
2.
When implemented, recent European commitments could decisively improve
program prospects. The June 29 statement of the euro area summit noted that the
Eurogroup will examine the situation of the Irish financial sector with the view of further
improving the sustainability of the well-performing adjustment program, and also affirmed
the imperative of breaking the vicious circle between banks and sovereigns. The resulting
boost to Irish sovereign debt markets enabled Ireland to make a significant bond issuance on
July 26. Making this first step into a durable return to the sovereign debt market is critical,
and Fund staff are working with the EC, ECB, and Irish authorities on technical solutions to
achieve the summit statement objectives for consideration by the Eurogroup.
3.
This report is to be read in conjunction with that for the 2012 Article IV
consultation with Ireland. In particular, a description of recent economic developments,
including developments in the financial sector, is provided in section II of the staff report for
the Article IV consultation. Section III of the Article IV staff report provides a discussion of
the economic outlook and risks, and Annex II provides the analysis of debt sustainability.
II. POLICY DISCUSSIONS
4.
The policy discussions focused on supporting recovery and regaining sustainable
access to market funding. In the financial sector, the central goal is to ensure the conditions
for renewed lending on a sustained basis. Fiscal consolidation needs remain substantial, and
discussions included steps to deepen the credibility of medium-term consolidation plans.
Discussions on structural reforms emphasized growth and job creation, including through
modest investment financed in part by European institutions.
A. Financial Sector
5.
The financial sector reform agenda aims to renew healthy lending in support of
Ireland’s economic recovery. The main components of the agenda are:


Completing financial sector restructuring: the restructuring plan for Permanent
TSB, refining the framework guiding the deleveraging of banks to minimize risks to
lending and deposit interest rates, and restoring the viability and solvency of the
credit union sector.

4



Strengthening asset quality: addressing rising mortgage arrears and monitoring
progress in the implementation of banks’ loan modification strategies, and the
implementation of the newly introduced personal insolvency bill.



Returning to profitability: the principal focus is on reducing funding costs related to
the Eligible Liability Guarantee (ELG) Scheme and high deposit rates. Cutting operating
costs through the implementation of banks’ restructuring plans is also a priority.



Protecting financial stability: preparations for the next stress test, collateral
valuation and provisioning practices, and further enhancing financial supervision.

6.
The authorities submitted to the European Commission a restructuring plan for
Permanent TSB (PTSB) to ensure its viability (MEFP ¶3). It is being reorganized into
three business units: (i) the core retail bank, which will be the viable bank franchise; (ii) an
asset management unit (AMU) to house legacy assets, which includes poorer quality and
impaired assets; and (iii) the U.K. residential mortgage operation, which will be divested as
soon as conditions permit.1 The separation into the three units should occur by endSeptember, which will enable monitoring of each of the units according to separate
management accounts. The plan seeks the timely legal and financial separation of the AMU,
which is deferred pending the Eurogroup’s consideration of the situation of the Irish financial
sector following the June 29 euro area summit statement.
7.
A range of efforts are underway to enhance banks’ profitability and lending. To
help reduce funding costs, the authorities are continuing to phase out the costly ELG Scheme,
and will develop a roadmap for weaning banks off the scheme while preserving financial
stability by end 2012 (MEFP ¶5). Already the U.K. unit of BoI is no longer covered, and
deposits placed with AIB’s U.K. units will not be covered by the scheme after August.
Operating costs are also being reduced through headcount reductions and branch closures,
with reductions of about 3,400 staff by end 2013 included in banks’ restructuring plans.
Though deleveraging has progressed on track, the monitoring framework will be streamlined
to the existing nominal targets for disposal and run-off of non-core assets (MEFP ¶4).2 The
goal is to minimize any risks to core lending and potential pressures on deposit interest rates
that could arise from the former targets on the loan to deposit ratio.
8.
The banking supervision framework will be further enhanced and preparations
continue for the Prudential Capital Assessment Review (PCAR) 2013 exercise. The first
phase of preparations for the 2013 stress tests is complete, and the CBI is requiring the
development of risk mitigating actions by PCAR banks in relation to credit data and
1

For additional information, see Box 4 in Ireland: Sixth Review Under the Extended Arrangement.

A total of €41.8 billion in asset disposals and run-offs has been completed by end April 2012, compared with
the end 2013 target of €70.2 billion. The main deviation from the original plan has been to defer the sale of
PTSB’s U.K. mortgage operation (Capital Home Loans).

5
documentation, to be completed by end September 2012 (MEFP ¶6).3 Collateral valuation
guidelines will be revised by end 2012 and the CBI will conduct supervisory reviews on
PCAR banks implementation of provisioning and impairment guidelines (by end-March
2013). In addition, the CBI is enhancing its reviews of risk-based capital models, including
banks’ approaches to forecasting and stress testing of risk weighted assets, in advance of
PCAR 2013 (MEFP ¶7).
9.
The authorities continue to advance the process of restoring the viability and
solvency of the credit union sector. On the regulatory front, the authorities published the
general scheme of a Bill strengthening the regulatory framework for credit unions in late June.
To help the sector return to viability, the Bill provides for the establishment of a Restructuring
Board, which will work with credit unions to deliver agreements on restructuring proposals,
and will also assist in their implementation.4 These proposals will be subject to CBI regulatory
approval, and the CBI will engage its resolution powers as needed, drawing on Resolution
Fund resources if required following discussions with the EC to address competition policy
issues stemming from the operation of the resolution framework.5 Regulations for the levy to
support the Resolution Fund should be adopted by end September (MEFP ¶8).
10.
Banks’ strategies to address loan arrears are being strengthened and tested, and
their implementation of loan modification will be subject to close monitoring by the
CBI. To address rising mortgage arrears, at CBI’s request the banks are preparing to roll out
a set of loan modification options by year end, and are piloting a number of these in the
interim (MEFP ¶9). The CBI will ensure that appropriately conservative regulatory and
accounting treatments of loan modification options are applied. To track the banks’
implementation of mortgage arrears resolution strategies, the CBI will publish a set of key
performance indicators on a quarterly basis starting at end 2012 (MEFP ¶10). Including
indicators of debtor sustainability among these indicators, e.g., borrowers’ monthly payments
relative to income, could provide for a useful gauge of progress. A similar framework is in
development for SME loans.
11.
Preparations are being advanced to implement the new personal insolvency
framework.6 The Personal Insolvency Bill introduced to parliament at the end of June
proposes three new debt settlement procedures and amends the Bankruptcy Act, including by
shortening the automatic discharge period to 3 years in judicial bankruptcy.7 Payments under
a settlement are determined based on debtors’ payment capacity while safeguarding a

reasonable standard of living, with debt service discipline upheld by stringent eligibility
criteria, creditor vote by qualified majority, and by court approval. The involvement of the
courts in the debt settlement procedures is welcome although adequate personnel and
operational resources will need to be redeployed to this important area. The draft legislation
is expected to be developed further at the committee stage of parliamentary discussions
scheduled for September, prior to its expected adoption later this year (MEFP ¶11). Staff has
recommended some refinements, such as regarding the procedures for the valuation of assets,
to enhance the effectiveness of the proposed regime. Pending guidance on reasonable
household expenses and on the licensing and supervision of personal insolvency practitioners
is essential for well-balanced and efficient reform outcome (MEFP ¶12).
B. Fiscal Policies
12.
Fiscal performance to end July 2012 is ahead of expectations. At 4.5 percent of
GDP, the exchequer primary deficit (excluding bank-related costs and delayed 2011
corporation tax receipts) was 0.7 percent of GDP below that in the corresponding period of
2011. Similarly, the end-June 2012 performance criterion on the cumulative exchequer
primary balance was met by a healthy margin of ½ percent of GDP (MEFP Table 2).8 Income
tax, VAT and corporation tax collections drove a total revenue over performance of
0.3 percentage points of GDP. Much of this surplus, however, was offset by additional health
spending and jobseeker payments owing to higher unemployment. The health sector overrun
reflected factors including an inability to meet budgetary targets on hospital activity, undercollection of income from private health insurers, a smaller-than-planned shift to generic
drugs, and higher-than-expected expenditure in respect of ―grace period‖ retirements.9
13.
The budget remains on track for the 2012 deficit target, but challenges to
reaching 2013 targets have increased. The robust revenue performance in 2011and thus far
in 2012 appears consistent with a stronger starting position implied by the recent upward
revision of nominal GDP for 2011, and some of this favorable base effect is likely to carry
forward. For 2012, a general government deficit of 8.3 percent of GDP is projected, within
the program ceiling of 8.6 percent of GDP. This projection assumes that revenue over
performance in the first half will be maintained, and that the recently announced corrective
measures in relation to the health sector overrun will cap it at its current level.10 Looking to
8

Net central government debt was below the corresponding end-June indicative target by 1.2 percent of GDP
owing to higher-than-expected revenues and lower-than-profiled interest costs.
9

A ―grace period,‖ which allowed staff to retire on terms linked to salaries before the 2010 pay cut, expired at
end-February 2012. Higher-than-expected retirements in the health sector, including in respect of staff returning
from career breaks, imply net pay and pension savings will be below budgeted levels in 2012.
10

The announced measures include realigning hospital activity with budgeted levels; rolling back some
additional programs; adjusting rosters to reduce overtime, agency and absenteeism-related costs; generating
higher income from private patients in public hospitals; faster processing of private health insurance claims; and
legislating to improve the governance of the Health Services Executive and to allow greater generic drug use.
The authorities expect these measures would eliminate the 0.2 percent of GDP overrun seen at end-May 2012.

7
2013, the markdown in growth projections makes the nominal deficit targets harder to attain,
and exacerbates concerns around pro-cyclical tightening.

PS: To facilitate comparability, (i) the €251 million corporation tax payment delayed from December 2011 into January 2012 is excluded from both the 2012 tax profile and outturn;
(ii) the €462 million in interest payments met in Jan-July 2011 via drawdown of the Capital Services Redemption Account (CSRA) are included in the 2011 "exchequer" interest bill;
(iii) symmetric entries of €646 million in respect of the Sinking Fund in March 2012 (recorded as current spending, and capital receipts) are taken out; (iv) the IBRC promissory note
payment of €3.06 billion that was settled through bond issuance is included in non-voted capital expenditure for 2012; (v) a €110 million exchequer-improving recoupment of a
Social Insurance Fund advance is excluded from 2011 net voted current spending; and (vi) the ILP payment of €1.3 billion is excluded from 2012 non-voted capital spending.

14.
Reductions in public service employment have exceeded targets while protecting
services, and continued progress in reducing the paybill is needed. At end-March 2012,
the public service was about 1 percent smaller than the end-2012 target of 294,000, and
9 percent below the end-2008 peak.11 To ensure that these significant personnel reductions do
not adversely impact frontline services (e.g. health, education, welfare, public safety) as well
as the state’s revenue collection capacity, the authorities are adopting a more flexible
approach to recruitment, especially where redeployments cannot offer a satisfactory solution
(MEFP ¶14). The framework of the Public Service (Croke Park) Agreement (2010–14) is
enabling important reforms in relation to over-time, sick pay and allowances (MEFP ¶15).12
Continued substantial progress on these fronts is needed to ensure an adequate and durable
reduction in the still-high public service paybill.
15.
Preparations for Budget 2013 are underway. An updated Medium-Term Fiscal
Statement will be published in October, setting out the consolidation amounts and
composition needed to credibly deliver a general government deficit below 3 percent of GDP
by 2015 (MEFP ¶16). The authorities are analyzing a range of strategic reform options to
11
12

See Public Service Agreement 2010-2014, Second Progress Report.

For example, the Labor Court recently supported government proposals to (i) halve the sick leave entitlement
in the public sector from seven days in 1 year to seven days in 2 years – delivering greater alignment with
private sector practice and (ii) restrict eligibility to ―critical‖ illness leave for exceptional circumstances.

8
ensure the consolidation is equitable and durable, including the introduction of a value-based
property tax, which will be included in draft legislation at the time of Budget 2013
(MEFP ¶17). Staff encouraged the authorities to fully specify the measures underpinning the
medium-term consolidation at the time of Budget 2013 in order to reduce household and
business uncertainty and to support market confidence in the consolidation path.
16.
A Fiscal Responsibility Bill to enshrine major fiscal framework reforms has been
published and budgetary transparency and reporting is being further enhanced.13 The
Bill includes two EU fiscal rules, a structural deficit ceiling and a debt ratio reduction rule. It
also gives statutory basis to the already-operational Irish Fiscal Advisory Council, guarantees
its annual budget, and provides parliamentary safeguards in relation to Council member
contract terminations.14 The authorities are planning to provide a statutory basis for the
multi-annual nominal expenditure ceilings by amending other legislation (MEFP ¶18). The
authorities are developing a supplementary more analytical format for regular exchequer
reporting, and will likely publish intra-year profiles for all major revenue and expenditure
items and the overall exchequer balance next year. The authorities are also consolidating
responsibilities for general government debt reporting at CSO and refining their methodology
for debt forecasting.
C. Growth and Structural Reforms
17.
The authorities welcomed the decision by European leaders to increase the
capacity of the EIB to address Europe’s growth and investment challenges. They will
use EIB support together with other sources of funding to supplement Exchequer capital
investments in a range of sectors including education, transport, and healthcare (MEFP ¶19).
These projects will be implemented over a number of years, and with the ongoing budgetary
costs peaking below 0.1 percent of GDP, the effect on fiscal consolidation needs and debt
sustainability is manageable. Together with reinvesting half of privatization proceeds, this
provides about 1½ percent of GDP in capital expenditure in the next few years.15
18.
Further steps are being taken to tackle the unacceptably high unemployment
rate. Under the Pathways to Work labor activation strategy, services for the unemployed are
being progressively integrated, with pilot programs underway in four locations to be
expanded to an additional 10 sites by year end. Resource and training needs of employment
centers are being examined by end September, as is the engagement of private sector firms in
the provision of activation services (MEFP ¶20). To reduce disincentives to work, the
authorities will replace the rental assistance for those with long-term housing needs with a
new Housing Assistance Payment (MEFP ¶21).

III. PROGRAM MODALITIES
19.

Program monitoring until June 2012 has been updated (MEFP Tables 1–3):



Quantitative performance criteria are proposed for end-December 2012. The
performance criterion for the Exchequer primary balance is unchanged for
end-September 2012, while the previously set end-December 2012 indicative target
has been amended to take into account a capital contribution for ESM and converted
into a performance criterion. Indicative targets for net central government debt are
raised to reflect the payment for Irish Life to complete PTSB’s recapitalization. An
end-June 2013 indicative target for the Exchequer primary balance is also proposed as
well as an indicative target for net central government debt for end-June 2013.



Structural benchmarks for end-September 2012 are unchanged. Structural
benchmarks for 2013 will be identified as appropriate during the eighth review.

20.
Program financing remains adequate for the remainder of 2012 given the recent
success in accessing bond markets. Benefitting from the euro area leaders June 29
statement, the authorities successfully tapped markets in July by issuing €0.5 billion in
Treasury bills on July 5, and €4.2 billion in bonds on July 26. Bonds were issued at 5-year
and 8-year tenors, with an average yield of just under 6 percent, and where the bulk of this
issue was taken up by foreign investors. In addition, a €1 billion switch of two bond issues
was undertaken to extend maturities. Further Treasury bill issues are planned for the
remainder of 2012, together with the issuance of amortizing bonds targeted at pension
funds.16 Overall market funding, together with rollovers of commercial paper and retail debt
issuance, is expected to be around €8 billion over 2012 as a whole (excluding debt issued to
IBRC in relation to the March 2012 promissory note payment).
21.
Maintaining market access is crucial for financing in 2013, but subject to risk. A
cash balance of about €18 billion is projected for end 2012, providing a cushion ahead of
large debt service payments in the second quarter of 2013, which include a €5.6 billion bond
redemption and, under current arrangements, a €3.1 billion payment on promissory notes,
and potentially a further €3.1 billion when IBRC’s repurchase agreement with the BoI
matures.17 The financing plan for the remainder of 2013 aims at maintaining full and regular
market access to finance exchequer cash needs, with about €4½ billion required to ensure an
adequate cash position at end 2013, although additional market funding could be appropriate
in order to further prefund a €7.6 billion redemption due in early 2014. Although the
assumptions on market access have been lowered, they remain dependent on favorable
market conditions.
16
17

See NTMA Launches Information Memorandum on Irish Amortising Bonds.

This repurchase agreement arose in relation to financing the promissory note payment due at end March 2012
with the issuance of a long-term government security to IBRC.

10
22.
Financing assurances remain in place, bolstered by support from European
partners. Financing has been identified for the 12 months ahead, but significant risks to
financing persist considering Ireland’s high debt burden, the close sovereign-banking
linkages following the deep banking crisis, the uncertainties about medium-term economic
growth prospects owing to both domestic and external factors, and the continuing crisis in the
euro area. In that regard, the European commitments from July 2011 and October 2011 to
continue providing support to all countries under programs until they have regained market
access, provided they fully implement those programs, provide assurance. Additional
comfort can be drawn from the June 29 summit statement affirming the imperative to break
the vicious circle between banks and sovereigns, and to examine the situation of the Irish
financial sector with the view of further improving the sustainability of the well-performing
adjustment program. However, there are risks if market expectations for results from the
latter commitment were to be disappointed.
23.

The exceptional access criteria continue to be met, albeit subject to risks:



Under the baseline macroeconomic framework, debt sustainability is expected to be
maintained over the medium term, although subject to significant risks if growth does
not strengthen or if further contingent liabilities materialize. As debt sustainability is
not assured with high probability, the program relies on the exemption afforded to
cases posing systemic international spillover risks given elevated euro area fragility.



In view of the June 29 commitment by euro area leaders to strengthen the
sustainability of Ireland’s program, there are adequate prospects to retain and expand
access to private capital markets before Fund repurchases begin in July 2015.
Nonetheless, risks from stress in sovereign debt markets in the euro area remain high.
Progress toward timely approval of the stronger European support would help ensure
that the exceptional access criteria continue to be fulfilled.



More broadly, Ireland’s policy program is sound and adjustment is being delivered,
providing strong prospects for program success. These would be improved by more
benign market conditions and more effective policy action at the European level.
IV. STAFF APPRAISAL

24.
Half way through the extended arrangement, the Irish authorities maintain very
strong ownership and implementation of their adjustment program. All performance
criteria and indicative targets for end June were met, two structural benchmarks were
observed, and financial sector, fiscal and structural reforms have proceeded as expected.
Despite the broadening distress within the euro area, Irish bond spreads have narrowed over
the past quarter, reflecting confidence in the authorities’ program and optimism following the
euro area summit of June 28–29. Nonetheless, the economic recovery is tentative and
unemployment unacceptably high.

11
25.
Putting the financial sector into a position to support the recovery through
sound lending will require continuing broad and intensive work. A return to profitability
is needed for lending to be sustainable, including through implementation of banks’
restructuring plans to reduce operational costs, and through weaning banks off the costly
ELG scheme in an orderly manner that protects their funding.
26.
Advances in developing banks’ strategy for dealing with mortgage arrears
should move increasingly to the implementation phase. The CBI’s plans for close
monitoring of banks’ progress are welcome and similar frameworks should be promptly
established for distressed credit to SMEs. Conservative valuation and provisioning for loan
modifications is needed to support the effectiveness of the restructuring process in
strengthening market confidence in bank balance sheets. The personal insolvency bill will
facilitate addressing debt distress while preserving debt service discipline. Operational issues
such as determining a reasonable standard of living and the licensing and supervision of
personal insolvency practitioners should be addressed in a timely manner.
27.
Deepening the credibility of Ireland’s fiscal consolidation can help weather
macroeconomic shocks. Consistent sound budget implementation continues in 2012, and the
effectiveness of measures to contain health expenditure overruns should be ensured. Yet
significant further consolidation is necessary to durably place public debt on a downward
trajectory. The fiscal responsibility bill, plans to provide a statutory basis for multi-annual
expenditure ceilings, further enhancements of budgetary transparency and reporting, and the
coming update of the Medium-Term Fiscal Statement together contribute to the credibility of
fiscal consolidation plan. Budget 2013 can reinforce this framework through a focus on high
quality measures that are durable and equitable, including a value-based property tax,
especially by specifying most of the fiscal measures for 2013-15. Should the growth outlook
deteriorate further, any significant additional fiscal adjustment need should be spread over
2014–15 to avoid stifling the still nascent recovery, while still respecting the medium-term
fiscal anchor of a 3 percent of GDP general government deficit in 2015.
28.
Timely approval of a further strengthening of European support is needed to
put the program on a clear path to successful completion. In the wake of the June 29
euro area leaders’ statement, in July the Irish authorities deftly seized the opportunity to
generate almost €6 billion in financing and reductions in near-term financing needs. This
experience signals that markets have confidence in Ireland’s implementation of strong
policies, so that improving debt sustainability and breaking the vicious circle between the
banks and the sovereign, can facilitate Ireland retaining durable access to market funding.
Timely commitment to such a strengthening of European support, especially ESM
investments in the equity of Irish banks, therefore offers real prospects for Ireland to exit its
reliance on official financing, which would be a positive breakthrough in the euro area crisis.
29.

Staff supports the authorities’ request for completion of the Seventh Review.

Attachment I. Letter of Intent

Dublin, 20 August 2012
Ms. Christine Lagarde
Managing Director
International Monetary Fund
Washington, D.C. 20431
Dear Ms. Lagarde:
1.
The Irish Government remains firmly committed to the programme, as illustrated by
our continued strong performance in implementing the agreed policy frameworks and
measures. Once more, for the seventh quarterly review, all programme targets have been met.
Recently released data shows that Ireland had stronger growth than expected in 2011. We
continue to move towards the goal of returning to sustainable funding in the international
capital markets during 2013, and took a further step with the successful Treasury Bill auction
and the new issuance of €4.2 billion in long-term bonds carried out by the NTMA in July. In
line with our growth focus, we have recently launched a multi-year (2012-2018) stimulus
package worth €2.25 billion. This will be used for investment in public infrastructure
projects, and also supporting employment enhancing and commercial projects and
augmenting existing Exchequer investment plans. Separately, we welcome the Heads of State
or Government statement from the Euro Area summit that it is imperative to break the
vicious circle between banks and sovereigns and that the Eurogroup will examine the
situation of the Irish financial sector with the view of further improving the sustainability of
our adjustment Programme.
2.
Once again, for the seventh review, we have met our commitments under the EU/IMF
supported programme in terms of policy reforms as well as quantitative targets (MEFP
Tables 1 and 2):


The performance criterion for end-June 2012 on the cumulative Exchequer primary
balance was met with a margin, as was the indicative target on the stock of Central
Government net debt. The continuous performance criterion on non-accumulation of
external payment arrears has also been met.



We submitted on 29 June an updated PTSB restructuring plan to the EC, ECB and
IMF (end June structural benchmark). The plan details the actions needed to ensure
the viability of PTSB’s core business, recognising that this requires the timely legal
and financial separation of the asset management unit.

16


We published on July 18 the Fiscal Responsibility Bill (end September structural
benchmark). In addition ton implementing the European Fiscal Stability Treaty, the
bill provides a legal framework for the Fiscal Advisory Council that ensures its
independence.

3.
In the attached Memorandum of Economic and Financial Policies (MEFP), we set out
our plans to further advance towards meeting the objectives laid out in our programme
supported by the Extended Arrangement and by the EU. Based on the strength of these
policies, and in light of our performance under the programme and our continued
commitment, we request the completion of the seventh review under the Extended
Arrangement. We also request that the seventh purchase in an amount equivalent to
SDR 758 million becomes available at the time of completion of the review.
4.
Looking forward, the financing need outlook until 2013 is broadly in line with
expectations at the sixth programme review. We resumed market issuance of Treasury bills
in July 2012 and envision regaining sustainable bond markets access in 2013. We have
further developed potential domestic financing sources and have maintained a large cash
buffer that provides additional comfort. We propose to leave the phasing unchanged with a
total purchasing amount equivalent to SDR 1,516 million over the remainder of 2012
(including this review), and SDR 2,922 million in 2013.
5.
We propose that quantitative performance criteria under the arrangement be
established for 31 December 2012, as set out in the attached MEFP. The Technical
Memorandum of Understanding (TMU) explains how programme targets are measured.
6.
We are confident that the policies set forth in the Letters of Intent of
3 December 2010, and subsequent letters as well as this letter are adequate to achieve the
objectives of our Programme. At the same time, while we do not envisage that revisions will
be needed, we stand ready to take any corrective actions that may become appropriate if
circumstances change. As is standard under Fund-supported programmes, we will consult
with the Fund on the adoption of such actions in advance in the event that revision of the
policies contained in this Letter and the attached Memorandum becomes necessary, and at
the same time consult with the European Commission and the ECB.
7.

This letter is being copied to Messrs. Draghi, Juncker, Rehn, and Shiarly.

Sincerely,
/s/

Attachment II. Memorandum of Economic and Financial Policies
A. Recent Economic Developments and Outlook
1.
Ireland’s economy returned to growth but continues to face headwinds from
slowing external activity. Real GDP grew by 1.4 per cent in 2011 on the back of a solid
export performance. As a result, the current account on the balance of payments recorded a
second consecutive surplus, 1.4 per cent of GNP. Domestic demand continues to decline—
albeit at a slowing pace—owing to continuing household balance sheet repair and the still
weak labour market. Although private sector employment grew modestly at 1.2 percent y/y,
the rate of unemployment rose to 14.8 percent in the first quarter. Driven by high energy
costs and administered price increases, the annual rate of HICP inflation averaged 1.8 percent
in the first six months of the year. Growth prospects for the remainder of 2012 and into 2013
remain modest, with weak trading partner growth dampening export demand even as further
competitiveness improvements cushion this effect. Yields on Irish sovereign bonds have
fallen sharply on foot of the 28–29 June 2012 euro area Summit, and Ireland successfully
returned to the Treasury Bill market.
2.
We welcome the decisions taken on 28–29 June by euro area authorities to
examine the situation of the Irish financial sector with the view of further improving the
sustainability of our well-performing adjustment programme. The euro area Summit also
recognised the imperative to break the vicious circle between banks and sovereigns that
burdens the economic recovery in Ireland. We will work closely with EC/ECB/IMF partners
to develop a plan to meet these stated objectives, for consideration by the Eurogroup. Key
financial sector issues to be addressed include the financing of the carve out of legacy assets
remaining in banks, especially PTSB, and the promissory notes held by IBRC. Meeting these
objectives would strengthen confidence and give impetus to Ireland's economic recovery,
thereby ensuring bond market access is regained in a durable manner, averting the need to
continue to rely on official financial support.
B. Financial Sector Policies
3.
We submitted to the European Commission a restructuring plan for PTSB at
end-June, and we are working with our external programme partners towards the
comprehensive strategy needed to ensure its viability. Under the plan, PTSB is
reorganising into three distinct units: (i) the core retail bank; (ii) an asset management unit to
house certain legacy assets; and (iii) the U.K. residential mortgage operation, which will be
divested as soon as conditions permit. Separate management accounts for each unit will be
established by end-September, at which time quarterly performance benchmarks will be, for
each unit, established by PTSB. The plan recognises that viability of the core retail bank
requires the timely legal and financial separation of the asset management unit, but such a
separation hinges on further sector-wide restructuring measures, the nature, timetable, and
mechanics of which are yet to be specified. Accordingly, we are exploring options in the
context of the decision of the euro area member states to examine the situation of the Irish
financial sector with the view of further improving the sustainability of our well-performing

18
adjustment programme. In the interim, work on financial and operational restructuring of
PTSB will continue.
4.
The CBI is streamlining the deleveraging framework to minimise risks to
lending and deposit pricing distortions while introducing advanced monitoring of
liquidity. Deleveraging has progressed well and will henceforth be assessed based on the
existing nominal targets for disposal and run-offs of non-core assets in line with the 2011
Financial Measures Programme while avoiding fire sales of assets. To prepare banks for the
scheduled implementation of Basel III liquidity ratios under CRD IV, we will supervise
developments in banks’ net stable funding ratio with an emphasis on elements under banks’
direct control.
5.
We will continue to phase out the ELG Scheme in an orderly manner. This
important measure helped preserve financial stability through a tumultuous period but could
be phased out gradually as the stability of the banking system becomes increasingly assured,
which would also enhance bank profitability. An inter-agency working group led by the
Department of Finance will by end-2012 develop a roadmap for weaning the banking system
off the scheme while preserving financial stability and respecting fiscal deficit targets.
6.
In parallel, we are actively working towards another rigorous stress test. In
preparation for the stress test, and in order to further refine future loan loss forecast estimates
the CBI is developing credit data and documentation remediation actions for the PCAR
banks as part of their risk mitigation plans. The risk mitigation plans will be updated by end
September 2012. We will also revise collateral valuation guidelines by end-December 2012.
In relation to mortgage and SME loan arrears, and consistent with our recently implemented
Guidelines on Provisioning, we will continue to ensure robust provisioning following the
application of loan modification options. In particular, where loans arrears are subject to
capitalisation we will require that the loan is not re-set to performing status and that the
provisions are held against this part of the portfolio until such time as an appropriate
repayment track record (i.e., a minimum of 6 months) has been achieved.
7.
We continue to enhance our supervisory framework. Supervisory reviews will
continue to be conducted on an annual basis for the PCAR banks in line with PRISM, our
risk based supervisory engagement model. As part of our ongoing supervision, the CBI is
also enhancing its approach to Credit Risk, Risk Weighted Asset (RWA) supervision
including conducting annual model performance reviews, assessing RWA calculation and
reviewing banks’ approaches to RWA forecasting and stress testing in advance of PCAR
2013. Supervisory powers will be further strengthened with the enactment of the Supervision
and Enforcement Bill, which will be enhanced at the Committee stage.
8.
We are pressing forward in restoring the viability and solvency of our credit
union sector. We are preparing regulations for the Resolution Fund levy to be adopted by
end-September (structural benchmark). Following consultations with key stakeholders, we
published the general scheme of a bill strengthening the regulatory framework for credit

19
unions in late June. It provides for the establishment of a Restructuring Board with strong
representation from the sector; administrative preparations to that end are underway. The
Board will work with credit unions to deliver agreements on restructuring proposals, which
will be subject to CBI regulatory approval and will assist in their implementation. The CBI
will engage its resolution powers as needed, drawing on Resolution Fund resources if
required.
9.
By year-end, banks will roll out options to address loan arrears and
unsustainable debts under the Mortgage Arrears Resolution Strategy (MARS). The CBI
has reviewed loan modification options for residential mortgages and has given feedback to
banks. As part of the MARS process, the CBI will communicate to individual banks to
ensure appropriately conservative regulatory and accounting treatment of loan modification
options is applied. Banks are preparing to roll out a complete set of loan modification
options by year-end, with pilots for a number of options set out in the recommendations of
the Inter-Departmental Mortgage Arrears Working Group. To provide a free consultation for
distressed borrowers, we will augment the Mortgage Advisory Services by end-September
with independent financial advisers, funded by banks.
10.
Implementation of banks’ loan modification strategies will be subject to
intensive bilateral engagement with supervisors to monitor progress. The CBI is
developing a set of key performance indicators to track the banks’ implementation of
mortgage arrears resolution strategies, which the CBI plans to collect, analyse and publish on
a quarterly basis starting at end-December 2012. A set of key performance indicators for
SMEs will also be developed by end-December 2012.
11.
We will establish a new insolvency framework that facilitates the resolution of
unsustainable personal debt. We introduced the Personal Insolvency Bill to the Oireachtas
in June to establish a new debt settlement regime in order to address personal financial
distress, including on residential mortgages. We recognise the importance of protecting
creditors’ rights and debt-servicing discipline by subjecting the primary new debt settlement
processes – the Debt Settlement Arrangement (DSA) and the Personal Insolvency
Arrangement (PIA) to a creditor vote by a qualified majority and by requiring court approval,
while safeguarding reasonable standards of living for the debtors. The Bill will also
modernise the Bankruptcy Act 1988 by shortening the automatic discharge period in line
with evolving international practice. We continue to consider further refinements of the Bill,
such as pertaining to the valuation of assets, ahead of its enactment.
12.
In parallel, we are advancing preparations to implement the new personal
insolvency framework. We expect soon to appoint a Director-Designate of the Insolvency
Service to oversee the establishment of the Service and contribute to the fine-tuning of the
law. A significant number of legal and operational issues require to be addressed in finalising
the Bill during the Autumn session commencing in September as to permit the Insolvency
Service to become operational in January 2013 or very shortly thereafter. These issues
include the licensing and supervision of personal insolvency practitioners and the evolution

20
of reasonable household expenses and necessary trade or business expenses guidelines for
debtors. Such guidelines to be prepared by end-year will be crucial for the approved
intermediaries in the operation of the Debt Relief Notice process and, will also be of use to
personal insolvency practitioners in the negotiation of a DSA or PIA. We will also review the
measures necessary for implementation of the framework.
C. Fiscal Policies
13.
We are on track to deliver a budget deficit within the 8.6 percent of GDP target
for 2012. Implementation of Budget 2012 has safely met the end-June performance criterion
on the exchequer primary balance and the indicative target on net debt, further extending our
track record of consistently achieving the programme’s fiscal targets. Despite the weakening
external environment and higher unemployment, strong collection efforts have brought in
revenues ahead of profile. At the same time, we are alert to pressures in health and social
protection spending, and will continue to manage expenditure to remain within budget.
14.
We continue to make the public service leaner and more effective. As noted in the
Second Implementation Report of the Public Service (―Croke Park‖) Agreement, the
personnel reduction targets for 2012 have been surpassed, with the public workforce now
9 percent smaller than the peak at end-2008. Re-deployments of personnel are gathering
pace, and we expect to be able to lock in some of the additional reductions in personnel
numbers without compromising critical service delivery. However, some recruitment
flexibility may be needed in situations where retirements have created particular skills
shortages, or where public service needs have risen.
15.
We are monitoring the public service paybill, including non-core pay elements.
In this regard, we are reining in the cost of overtime through enhanced workforce planning
and management, and have completed comprehensive reviews of sick pay and allowance
policies as the basis for further cost-saving reforms.
16.
We have begun preparations for Budget 2013 with the aim of further
underpinning the credibility of our medium-term fiscal goals. We are currently finalising
a new Employment Control Framework, which will fix departmental resource allocations for
next year. In mid-October, we will publish an updated Medium-Term Fiscal Statement
setting out our macroeconomic and fiscal projections out to 2015, and the underlying
consolidation amounts and composition needed to credibly deliver a consolidation path in
line with the Excessive Deficit Procedure, bringing the general government deficit below
3 percent of GDP by 2015.
17.
To ensure that this consolidation protects growth and is equitable and durable,
we are analysing a range of strategic reform options. On the spending side, we are
seeking to better target our social supports and subsidies, attenuate work disincentives arising
from the structure and interaction of social assistance payments, and contain ageing-related
spending pressures. On the tax side, we are looking to broaden the base and develop

21
additional stable revenue sources, including through the introduction of a value-based
property tax. Core features of its design and collection will be included in draft legislation at
the time of Budget 2013.
18.
We are strengthening our national fiscal framework in line with EU rules and
further enhancing budgetary transparency and reporting. The approval of the end-May
referendum cleared the way for parliamentary ratification of the Treaty on Stability,
Coordination and Governance. We have published the draft legislation to implement the
Treaty, which will enshrine the independence of the already-established Irish Fiscal Advisory
Council and ensure its adequate resourcing. This legislation will also include the automatic
correction mechanism that would apply in cases of deviations from fiscal targets.
Furthermore, we will publish legislation to give statutory basis to the already-operational
multi-annual expenditure limits by end September. We have begun preparatory work to
enhance our regular fiscal reporting on an exchequer and general government basis. Taking
into account the recommendations of the External Review of the Compilation of General
Government Debt Statistics, we will consolidate the appropriate responsibilities for debt
reporting at the CSO, while also refining the methodology for general government debt
forecasting in the Department of Finance.
D. Growth and Structural Reforms
19.
Generating growth and jobs on a sustainable basis remains a critical priority.
We welcome the decision by European leaders to increase the capacity of the European
Investment Bank (EIB) to address Europe’s growth and investment challenges. We plan to
avail of this opportunity to supplement our exchequer capital programme through PPP
projects with non-Exchequer sources of funding including EIB. The projects will be in a
range of sectors including education, transport and health care. Our plans for the disposal of
state assets in the energy generation, aviation, and forestry sectors are advancing as
envisioned, with no regulatory or legislative obstacles to the commencement of the sales
process in 2013 having been identified. We will use at least half of these proceeds to reduce
public debt in due course, with the details on timing and implementation to be agreed, and,
once realised, the remainder will be reinvested in job-rich projects of a commercial nature
consistent with our fiscal targets.
20.
We are taking further steps to tackle the unacceptably high unemployment rate.
As envisaged under our Pathways to Work activation strategy, we are progressively rolling
out an integrated services system for the unemployed, where the profiling of clients,
development of individual career progress plans, and granting of benefits are carried out by
case workers. Pilot programs are currently underway in four locations, with a plan to
implement them at ten further sites across the country by year-end. To ensure an adequate
level of services, we are currently examining resource levels and training needs of the new
integrated employment centres. We are also considering the engagement of private sector
firms in the provision of activation services, especially for the long-term unemployed. We
will prepare an update on both of these issues by end-September 2012. We are also

22
intensifying our engagement with employers, aiming to increase the notification of vacancies
to the employment service and to encourage recruitment of the unemployed from the Live
Register.
21.
As we move into more-active engagement with the unemployed, we are
reforming the structure of welfare payments to reduce disincentives to work. In this
context, we will transfer responsibility for the provision of rental assistance for persons with
a long-term housing need from Department of Social Protection to housing authorities using
a new Housing Assistance Payment. A commencement date for the new arrangements of 1
January 2013 has been agreed subject to further consideration of legal and administrative
issues by Government. This initiative will help reduce net replacement rates for some groups
of long-term unemployed. The DECLG and DSP will also report on the housing assistance
reform, in particular on the introduction of the new Housing Assistance Payment by end
September 2012.
E. Programme Financing and Monitoring
22.
The programme remains adequately financed. Building on our strong record of
programme performance, we have returned to the Treasury Bill market for the first time since
September 2010, raising €500 million through Treasury Bill issuance and €4.2 billion by
selling long-term bonds on favourable terms from a broad investor base in July. We are
maintaining close contacts with a wide range of market participants with the aim of regaining
sustainable bond market access in 2013 and are examining alternative funding sources,
including the sale of amortising bonds to pension funds. In view of the external risks to our
financing strategy, we continue to maintain a prudent cash buffer. The euro area leaders’
commitment to meet financing needs until market access is regained, providing that the
programme remains on track, offers a further valuable backstop in the event that financial
market conditions in the euro area were to deteriorate.
23.
Implementation of the policies under the programme will continue to be
monitored through quarterly and continuous performance criteria, indicative targets,
structural benchmarks, and quarterly programme reviews, as envisaged in our Letters
of Intent since the inception of the arrangement on 3 December 2010 along with this
letter. The programme also continues to be in compliance with requirements under the
Memorandum of Understanding on Specific Policy Conditionality. The attached Technical
Memorandum of Understanding defines the quantitative performance criteria and indicative
targets under the programme. The Government’s targets for the exchequer primary balance
are monitored through quarterly performance criteria and net central government debt is an
indicative target (Table 2). As is standard in EU/IMF arrangements, there is a continuous
performance criterion on the non-accumulation of external payment arrears. Progress on
implementing structural reforms is monitored through structural benchmarks
(Tables 1 and 3).
24.
We authorise the IMF and the European Commission to publish the Letter of
Intent and its attachments and the related staff report.

Attachment III. Technical Memorandum of Understanding
August 20, 2012
1.
This Technical Memorandum of Understanding (TMU) sets out the
understandings regarding the definitions of the indicators subject to performance criteria
and indicative targets under the arrangement supported by the Extended Fund Facility
(EFF). These performance criteria and indicative targets are reported in Table 2 attached
to the Memorandum of Economic and Financial Policies (MEFP). This TMU also
describes the methods to be used in assessing the programme performance and the
information requirements to ensure adequate monitoring of the targets.
2.
For programme purposes, all foreign currency-related assets, liabilities, and flows
will be evaluated at ―programme exchange rates‖, with the exception of the items
affecting the government fiscal balances, which will be measured at current exchange
rates. The programme exchange rates are those that prevailed on December 30, 2011 as
shown on the IMF’s website (http://www.imf.org/external/np/fin/data/rms_five.aspx,
accessed 19 January 2012), in particular, €1 = 1.2939 U.S. dollar and €1 = 0.842786
SDR.
I.

QUANTITATIVE PERFORMANCE CRITERIA AND INDICATIVE TARGETS

Floor on the Exchequer Primary Balance
3.
The Exchequer balance is the traditional domestic budgetary aggregate which
measures the net surplus or net deficit position of the Exchequer Account. The Exchequer
Account is the single bank account of the Central Fund and is held at the Central Bank of
Ireland. The annual audited accounts of the Exchequer Account produced by the
Department of Finance are known as the Finance Accounts. An unaudited summary
known as the Exchequer Statement is produced at the end of each month. Under the Irish
Constitution, all Government receipts are paid in to the Central Fund and all Government
expenditure is funded from it, unless provided otherwise by law.1 The Exchequer balance
is the difference between total receipts into, and total expenditure out of, the Exchequer
Account. It measures the sum of the current and capital balances. The current balance is
defined as current receipts (tax and non-tax revenue) minus current expenditure (voted
expenditure and non-voted expenditure charged directly on the Central Fund, including
the Sinking Fund). The capital balance is defined as capital receipts (Sinking Fund and
other capital receipts) minus capital expenditure (voted and non-voted expenditure). The
Sinking Fund provision is a transfer from the current account to the capital account to
reduce national debt and has no effect on the overall Exchequer balance.
1

Receipts of the Central Fund comprise Exchequer tax revenues, non-tax revenues, receipts from the European Union
and other capital receipts. Charges on the Central Fund include the expenditure of Government departments and offices,
payments related to the servicing of the national debt, payments to the European Union Budget, the salaries, pensions
and allowances of the President, judiciary, and Comptroller & Auditor General and the running costs of the Houses of
the Oireachtas (Parliament). Extra-budgetary funds (including the National Pensions Reserve Fund), the Social
Insurance Fund, semi-state bodies and local governments are not part of the Exchequer system.

27
4.
The performance criteria are set on the Exchequer primary balance (the Exchequer
balance excluding net debt interest payments in the service of the National Debt, but
including debt issued to IBRC to settle Promissory Note payments).2
5.
For the purposes of the programme, the floor on the Exchequer primary balance
(quantitative performance criterion) will be adjusted downward by payments for bank
restructuring carried out under the programme’s banking sector support and restructuring
strategy. Such payments may include, inter alia, loans to banks, investments in their
equity (requited recapitalisation), unrequited recapitalisation, and purchases of troubled
assets, which are carried out in line with programme objectives. The floor will be adjusted
upward by the amount of proceeds from sales of bank equity held by the government or
NPRF that are treated as Exchequer receipts. The floor will also be adjusted downward
for Exchequer outlays for the resolution of credit unions, and upward for any return of
such outlays to the Exchequer and also for the recoupment of such outlays by the
Exchequer from the Resolution Fund. Any other financial operation by Government to
support banks, including the issuance of guarantees or provision of liquidity, will be
reported to EC, IMF, and ECB staffs.
6.
The floor on the Exchequer primary balance (quantitative performance criterion)
in each year will be measured cumulatively from the start of that calendar year.

Any policy changes, including in administration and enforcement of taxes, which
impact the revenue projection set out in paragraph 7 will lead to a reassessment of the
adjustor in the context of program reviews.
Ceiling on the Stock of Central Government Net Debt
9.
The stock of net central government debt, for the purposes of the programme, is
defined as the National Debt less liquid assets of the National Pensions Reserve Fund
(NPRF). The National Debt is defined as the total outstanding amount of principal
borrowed by central government and not repaid as of the test date, less liquid assets
available for redemption of those liabilities at the same date. These liquid assets comprise
the Exchequer cash balances (including cash in the Capital Services Redemption
Account), Exchequer deposits with commercial banks and other institutions, and
investments in investment grade sovereign bills. For the purposes of the programme,
NPRF liquid assets include the asset classes listed above, and also all marketable
securities such as equities, government bonds and other listed investments. NPRF shares
in domestic Irish banks, as well as the NPRF’s non-liquid discretionary portfolio are
excluded from the definition of liquid assets.
10.
For the purposes of the programme, the ceiling on the central government net debt
(indicative target) will be adjusted upward by debt arising from payments for bank
restructuring carried out under the programme’s banking sector support and restructuring
strategy. These payments may include, inter alia, loans to banks, investments in their
equity (requited recapitalisation); unrequited recapitalisation; and purchases of troubled
assets, which are carried out in line with programme objectives. The ceiling will also be
adjusted (i) downward by the amount of proceeds from sales of bank equity held by the
government or NPRF that are treated as Exchequer or NPRF receipts; (ii) upward for
Exchequer outlays for the resolution of credit unions, and downward for any return of
such outlays to the Exchequer and also for the recoupment of such outlays by the
Exchequer from the Resolution Fund; (iii) downward by the amount liquidated from the
NPRF non-liquid discretionary portfolio; and (iv) downward (upward) by valuation gains
(losses) in the NPRF liquid portfolio. The programme exchange rates will apply to all
non-Euro denominated debt.

29
11.
The ceiling on the outstanding stock of central government net debt will be
adjusted upward (downward) by the amount of any final upward (downward) revision to
the stock of end-June 2012 central government net debt.

Non-accumulation of External Payments Arrears by Central Government
12.
The central government will accumulate no external payments arrears during the
programme period. For the purposes of this performance criterion, an external payment
arrear will be defined as a payment by the central government on its contracted or
guaranteed external debt that has not been made within five business days after falling
due, excluding any contractual grace period. The performance criterion will apply on a
continuous basis.
13.
The stock of external payments arrears of the central government will be
calculated based on the schedule of external payments obligations reported by the
National Treasury Management Agency.
II.

REPORTING REQUIREMENTS

14.

Dear Messrs Draghi, Juncker, Rehn, and Shiarly
1.
The Irish Government remains firmly committed to the programme, as illustrated
by our continued strong performance in implementing the agreed policy frameworks and
measures. Recently released data shows that Ireland had stronger growth than expected in
2011. We returned to the international capital markets in July 2012 with the NTMA
issuing both Treasury Bills and long-term bonds totaling €4.7 bn in new funding. In line
with our growth focus, we have recently launched a multi-year (2012-2018) stimulus
package worth €2.25 billion. This will be financed through Public-Private Partnerships

32
(PPPs) with EIB and private sector participation and be used for investment in public
infrastructure projects, and also support employment-enhancing and commercial projects
and augment existing Exchequer investment plans. The fiscal consolidation path agreed
under the Programme will not be affected.
2.
The passage of the referendum allowing the ratification of the Treaty on Stability,
Coordination and Governance in the Economic and Monetary Union has demonstrated
Ireland’s commitment to prudent policies and consolidation.
3.
We welcome the June 29 statement of the Heads of State or Government of the
euro area stressing the need to sever the pernicious link between the banks and the
sovereigns and mandating the euro group to examine the situation of the Irish financial
sector with a view to enhancing the sustainability of our well-performing programme. We
are working with staff from the European Commission, the European Central Bank and
the International Monetary Fund to present options to the Eurogroup in the next few
weeks. In the meantime, we remain committed to maintaining our strong record of
programme implementation, beginning with the forthcoming preparations for the 2013
Budget.
4.
Once again, for the seventh review, we have met our commitments under the
EU/IMF supported programme in terms of policy reforms as well as quantitative targets:


As regards our fiscal consolidation objectives, the cumulative exchequer balance
through end-June 2012 was ahead of the programme profile and the 2012 general
government deficit is projected to be at, or below, the 8.6% of GDP programme
ceiling.



We have continued to advance the envisaged structural reforms. In particular, we
have agreed on a detailed, time-bound implementation plan for the transfer of
water service provision to Irish Water, made provisions for an increase in the
staffing of the Competition Authority, and assessed scope for reform of welfare
payments, including to reduce any disincentives to take up work. We have also
conducted a due diligence on the state assets which we have identified for disposal
starting in 2013, and have identified no regulatory or legislative obstacle to
bringing the assets closer to the point of sales in the weeks and months ahead.
Finally, we have presented to the Oireachtas a revised Industrial Relations
(Amendment) Bill in line with the result of public consultations and programme
understandings. The bill has been enacted and was commenced on August 1.



The overarching strengthening, restructuring, and right-sizing of the domestic
banking sector and the credit union sector is also progressing according to plans,
including for example with the completion of the remaining capitalization of
Permanent TSB and of some of the work-streams in the Financial Measures
Programme (independent asset quality review, distressed credit operations review,
a data integrity validation exercise, and an income recognition and re-aging

33
project), the submission to the European Commission of a restructuring plan for
Permanent TSB, and the publication of the legislation on personal insolvency
reform.
5.
In the attached sixth update of the Memorandum of Understanding of Specific
Economic Policy Conditionality (the MOU), as well as in the Memorandum of Economic
and Financial Policies (MEFP), we set out our plans to further advance towards meeting
the objectives of our economic adjustment programme supported by financial assistance
from the EU and the IMF. Based on the strength of these policies, and in light of our
performance under the programme and our continued commitment, we request the
completion of the seventh review and the release of the seventh EFSF/EFSM
disbursement of EUR 1 billion.
6.
Looking forward, the financing need outlook until 2013 is broadly in line with
expectations at the sixth programme review, whereby our larger cash buffer provides
additional comfort. We continue to move steadily towards our core goal of regaining
sustainable access to the international capital markets during 2013, and have recently
returned successfully to the both the Treasury Bill and bond markets with issuance which
received ample demand and were favourably priced. As a result, the funding hurdle
associated with a large bond redemption in January 2014 has been significantly reduced.
7.
We are confident that the policies set forth in the Letters of Intent of
3 December 2010, and subsequent letters as well as this letter are adequate to achieve the
objectives of our Programme. At the same time, while we do not envisage that revisions

Attachment V. Memorandum of Understanding on Specific Economic Policy
Conditionality (European Commission)
IRELAND
MEMORANDUM OF UNDERSTANDING
ON

SPECIFIC ECONOMIC POLICY CONDITIONALITY
(SIXTH UPDATE)
13 September 2012
With regard to Council Regulation (EU) n° 407/2010 of 11 May 2010 establishing a
European Financial Stabilisation Mechanism (EFSM), and in particular Article 3(5)
thereof, this sixth update of the Memorandum of Understanding on Specific Economic
Policy Conditionality (MoU) details the general economic policy conditions as embedded
in Council Implementing Decision 2011/77/EU of 7 December 2010 on granting Union
financial assistance to Ireland.
The quarterly disbursement of financial assistance from the EFSM1 will be subject to
quarterly reviews of conditionality for the duration of the programme. Release of the
instalments will be based on observance of quantitative performance criteria, respect for
EU Council Decisions and Recommendations in the context of the excessive deficit
procedure (EDP), and a positive evaluation of progress made with respect to policy
criteria in the Memorandum of Economic and Financial Policies (MEFP) and this updated
MoU, which details and further specifies the criteria that will be assessed for the
successive reviews up to the end of 2013. If targets are expected to be missed, additional
action will be taken.
For the duration of the EU/IMF financial assistance programme the Irish authorities will
take all the necessary measures to ensure a successful implementation of the programme
and minimise the costs to the taxpayers, while protecting the most vulnerable. In
particular, they commit to:
-

1

Rigorously implement fiscal policy consistent with the requirements of the
excessive deficit procedure. In particular, the Department of Finance and the
Department of Public Expenditure and Reform will continue to ensure
effective tax collection and tight supervision of expenditure commitments by
the line departments to ensure that the primary deficit target in cash (see
Table 1 of MEFP and the Technical Memorandum of Understanding, TMU)
and the general Government nominal budget deficit on ESA95 basis as set
out in the EU Council Recommendation on excessive deficit procedures are

On 28 November 2010 Eurogroup and ECOFIN Ministers issued a statement clarifying that euro-area and
EU financial support will be provided on the basis of the programme which has been negotiated with the
Irish authorities by the Commission and the IMF, in liaison with the ECB. Further to the Union support
from the EFSM, loans from the EU and its Member States will include contributions from the European
Financial Stability Facility (EFSF) and bilateral lending support from the United Kingdom, Sweden, and
Denmark. The Loan Facility Agreements on these financing contributions will specify that the
disbursements there under are subject to the compliance with the conditions of this Memorandum.

achieved. Any additional unplanned revenues must be allocated to debt
reduction. Moreover, the nominal value of Social Welfare pensions will not
be increased.
-

Continue to strengthen the fiscal framework and reporting in line with that of
the EU.

-

Use at least half of the proceeds from state asset sales for eventual debt
reduction while also reinvesting the remainder of the total realised proceeds
in projects which are of a commercial nature, meet ex-ante cost benefit
criteria, enhance employment and preserve long term fiscal sustainability,
including Programme and EDP fiscal targets.

-

Continuously monitor financial markets to exploit opportunities to return to
commercial funding as soon as possible.

-

Ensure that activation services are enhanced, to tackle the high and persistent
rate of long-term unemployment. In particular, the Department of Social
Protection will take steps to improve the ratio of vacancies filled off the live
register, focus on re-training the unemployed to reduce the risk of long-term
unemployment and ensure appropriate incentives through the implementation
of sanctions. Generally, the government will advance its plans to introduce
new activation measures building on Pathways to Work (the government's
strategy for institutional reform of the activation system).

-

Ensure that no further exemptions to the competition law framework will be
granted unless they are entirely consistent with the goals of the EU/IMF
Programme and the needs of the economy.

-

Ensure that NAMA: (i) maintains the highest standards of governance with
appropriate accountability and transparency arrangements; (ii) reduces the
costs of its operations; and (iii) constructively contributes to the restoration
of the Irish property market in the course of meeting the asset disposal targets
established and monitored by the NAMA Board, including redemption of
€7.5 billion worth of senior bonds by end 2013.

-

Ensure that the restructuring of credit unions will underpin the financial
stability and long term sustainability of the sector. The restructuring will be
completed in as short a timeframe as possible under a clear plan identifying
credit unions appropriate for restructuring, subject to Central Bank regulatory
approval. As regards funding, the first call should be on the credit unions
concerned or the sector as a whole; any Exchequer funding should be
minimised, should be provided only in the context of a restructuring plan in
compliance with EU state aid rules, and should be recouped from the sector
over time. In parallel, the Central Bank will continue its inspections to
determine the financial condition of the weakest credit unions, and will
engage its resolution powers as needed, drawing on Resolution Fund
resources if required.

-

Ensure continued compliance with the minimum Core Tier 1 Capital ratio of
10.5 percent for all PCAR banks (AIB, BOI, and PTSB).

36
-

Consult ex-ante with the European Commission, the ECB and the IMF on the
adoption of policies that are not included in this Memorandum but that could
have a material impact on the achievement of programme objectives.

To facilitate programme monitoring, the authorities will provide the European
Commission, the ECB and the IMF with:

1.

-

All information required to monitor progress during programme
implementation and to track the economic and financial situation.

-

A compliance report on the fulfilment of the conditionality prior to the
release of the instalments.

-

Reliable and regular availability of budgetary and other data as detailed in
Annex 1.

Safeguards Assessment:

The safeguards assessment of the Central Bank of Ireland (CBI) found that the CBI has a relatively
strong safeguards framework in place. Its financial statements are audited in accordance with
international standards and published. Governance and control systems adhere to good practices.
The assessment recommended measures to address heightened risks emanating from the financial
crisis, notably liquidity lending, and to improve transparency. Recommendations were also made to
strengthen the de-jure autonomy of the central bank. Progress has been made in implementing
these recommendations: the CBI has strengthened internal governance and control procedures for
ELA; brought forward the publication dates for its audited financial accounts; clarified its accounting
framework for areas not covered by ECB guidelines; and formally approved revised investment
guidelines. The CBI and DoF are considering how to strengthen the arrangements for financial
autonomy of the CBI, which may require changes to central bank legislation and changes in other
related regulations, which would be prepared in consultation with the ECB.
IX.

Article IV Consultations:

The last Article IV consultation was concluded on July 7, 2010 (IMF Country Report No. 10/209).
Article IV consultations with Ireland are on the 24-month cycle during the Extended Arrangement.
X.

Seventh Review Under the Extended Arrangement:

Discussions were held in Dublin during July 3–19, 2012. The IMF team comprised Craig Beaumont (head),

IRELAND

STATISTICAL ISSUES
A. Assessment of Data Adequacy for Surveillance
General: Data provision is broadly adequate for surveillance.
National accounts and real sector data. Quarterly national accounts are currently published
within three months of its reference period. Other real sector data are relatively timely, with
industrial production and retail sales data published within six weeks and employment data
within 3 months of the reference period, but some non-SDDS series are published one and a half
years later (e.g., household disposable income). Employment and unit labor costs, and national
income and expenditure data are usually available with a three-month lag.
Wages and earnings statistics. The quarterly Earnings, Hours and Employment Costs Survey has
replaced the four-yearly Labor Cost Survey, and also replaces all other existing short-term
earnings surveys. The results are comparable across sectors and include more detail on
components of earnings and labor costs than was available before. However, data are only
available with more than six months lag.
Government finance statistics. The authorities publish Exchequer returns on a monthly and
quarterly basis, but only annual data are available for general government finances. The
authorities are working to strengthen the analytical content of exchequer reporting and
enhancing reporting and forecasting for the general government.
External data. Quarterly balance of payments data are compiled by the Central Statistics Office
and are based on statistical surveys combined with administrative data. These data are closely
integrated with the compilation of national accounts and are in line with the Balance of Payments
Manual, Fifth edition (BPM5), although the historical data covers only years starting from 1998.
Furthermore, some discrepancies remain between exports and imports data from the national
accounts and the balance of payments. Data on the international investment position are
published with a six months lag.
B. Data Standards and Quality
Ireland is subject to the statistical requirements
and timeliness and reporting standards of
Eurostat and the European Central Bank (ECB).
Ireland subscribes to the Fund’s Special Data
Dissemination Standard and uses SDDS
flexibility option on the timeliness of the wages
and earnings and central government debt
data.

Staff Report for the 2012 Article IV Consultation and Seventh Review
Under the Extended Arrangement—Supplementary Information
Prepared by the European Department
(In consultation with other departments)
Approved by Ajai Chopra and Lorenzo Giorgianni
August 31, 2012
1.
This supplement provides an update on economic and financial developments
since the issuance of the staff reports on August 22, 2012 (EBS/12/102 and SM/12/220).
The additional information does not change the thrust of the staff appraisal.
2.
Following sales of Treasury bills and bonds in July, the government has recently
placed €1.0 billion of long-term amortizing bonds at an average yield of 5.91 percent.
On August 23, the National Treasury Management Agency sold a series of amortizing bonds,
with final maturity dates ranging from 15 to 35 years in a fixed price tap offer, meeting the
needs of the Irish pension industry to match their pension liabilities.1 The total take-up is
€0.4 billion higher than assumed in Table 1 of the Seventh Review, further enhancing the
cash balance and reducing future funding needs. Since the staff reports were issued, Irish
bond spreads have been broadly stable, after declining significantly from late June.

declined 1.4 percent in the first seven months, which is consistent with the projected decline
in private consumption. Wages and working hours remained essentially flat in Q2 from a

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

International Monetary Fund

Washington, D. C. 20431 USA

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2012 Article IV Consultation with Ireland
On September 5, 2012, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF)
concluded the Article IV consultation with Ireland. 1
Background
Since the last Article IV consultation in mid-2010, the Irish government has faced a loss of
access to market financing resulting in a need to draw on financial support from the EU-IMF
from late 2010. This development was the culmination of an exceptionally deep banking crisis
associated with the bursting of a commercial and residential property bubble. The economic
impact was severe, with real GDP contracting 8 percent during 2008-10, the CPI deflating by
5½ percent, unemployment jumping sharply to recently approach 15 percent, and house prices
falling to half of their peak levels. Slumping revenues resulted in the fiscal deficit widening to
over 10 percent of GDP in 2009-10, and large loan losses in the banking system required public
support of some 40 percent of GDP, contributing substantially to the dramatic rise in public debt
from 25 percent of GDP in 2007 to about 118 percent in 2012.
The Irish authorities’ key policy goals are to repair the banking system so that it is able to
support economic recovery, put the public finances on a sound footing, and to foster domestic
activity and job creation by implementing structural reforms. The authorities have decisively
Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On
return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the
Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the
Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the
country's authorities. An explanation of any qualifiers used in summings up can be found here:

implemented their strategy to reorganize, recapitalize, and downsize the banking system,
succeeding in restoring strong capital ratios and stabilizing deposits. Nonetheless,
nonperforming loans have risen to high levels and bank profitability and lending is weak. In
particular, the share of the principal of owner occupied residential mortgage loans in arrears has
risen to almost 15 percent, reflecting the household debt burdens of some 210 percent of
disposable income and high unemployment.
Fiscal consolidation was well underway before the EU-IMF support program, with cumulative
budget measures during 2009-12 reducing the structural primary deficit by some 8 percent of
GDP. In 2012, the budget is on track to reach the 8.6 percent of GDP deficit target. The
authorities are committed to the medium-term goal of reducing the deficit to below 3 percent of
GDP by 2015, and the Medium-term Fiscal Statement of November 2011 indicates that this will
entail a 5 percent of GDP consolidation during 2013-15.
Aided by a significant unwinding of competitiveness losses during the boom, Ireland returned to
export-led growth of 1.4 percent in 2011. Yet, domestic demand continued to decline as
domestic and external uncertainties hinder investment, households seek to reduce debt
burdens, and fiscal adjustment continues. A weakening in trading partner growth is expected to
slow Ireland’s growth to about 0.4 percent in 2012, and growth projections for 2013 have eased
to about 1.4 percent owing to a slower rebound in exports and recovery in domestic demand.
Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors commended the authorities for their strong ownership and steadfast
implementation of the program, particularly financial sector reform and fiscal consolidation. The
economy has resumed modest growth, but downside risks remain high, and substantial and
difficult further policy efforts are needed to promote a sustained economic recovery.
Against this backdrop, Directors welcomed the authorities’ determination to put the public
finances on a sound footing, repair the banking system so that it can support economic
recovery, and implement structural reforms to boost domestic activity and job creation. They
agreed that the prospects for the success of Ireland’s strong policy implementation hinge on
recovery across the region and continued progress at the European level to ensure the stability
of the euro area. Directors welcomed the June 29 statement by euro area leaders to further
improve the sustainability of Ireland’s well-performing program, which has been instrumental in
the country’s recent successful return to the sovereign bond market. They looked forward to a
timely agreement on concrete steps that would break the vicious circle between banks and the
sovereign.
Directors commended the determined actions taken by the authorities to restructure, downsize,
and recapitalize banks. To restore banks’ ability to provide sound credit and help revive

3
domestic demand, they emphasized the need to arrest the deterioration in bank asset quality
and regain bank profitability. Directors supported continued supervisory engagement to promote
banks’ implementation of durable solutions for households’ mortgage arrears and advancing a
similar approach for loans to SMEs. They considered that reforms of the personal insolvency
framework would help address debt distress while preserving debt service discipline, and that
the repossession framework should complement these reforms. Noting euro area steps toward
enabling the ESM to recapitalize banks directly, along with the creation of a single supervisory
mechanism, Directors concurred that temporary ESM ownership of Irish banks could reduce
funding costs, boosting their profitability and ability to support economic recovery.
Directors commended the substantial fiscal consolidation already implemented, but stressed
that significant efforts are still needed to bring the deficit below 3 percent of GDP by 2015. They
called for high quality expenditure and revenue measures that would be growth friendly, durable
and equitable. Directors concurred that better targeting of spending, including on state
pensions, could deliver more immediate savings while protecting the most vulnerable. In
addition, they supported deeper reforms of key government services to produce medium-term
savings, especially health and education services, and highlighted that the public service
agreement should facilitate these reforms. Nonetheless, further reductions in public sector
wages might also be needed if wage bill targets cannot be met while protecting public services.
On the revenue front, Directors saw merit in broadening the tax base, including by introducing a
value-based property tax.
Directors agreed that reducing the high level of unemployment remains critical, and supported
the infrastructure stimulus package. They particularly saw a need to contain structural
unemployment and encouraged reallocating resources to services to help job seekers regain
work together with reforms to the structure of social benefits. Facilitating mobility across sectors
will need effective education and training policies and regular monitoring of outcomes, and will
be aided by recent legislative reforms of sectoral wage setting.

IMF Completes Seventh Review Under the Extended Arrangement with Ireland and
Approves €0.92 Billion Disbursement
The Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) today completed the seventh
review of Ireland’s performance under an economic program supported by a three-year, SDR
19.47 billion (about €23.55 billion or about US$29.62 billion) arrangement under the
Extended Fund Facility (EFF), or the equivalent of about 1,548 percent of Ireland’s IMF
quota. The completion of the review enables the disbursement of an amount equivalent to
SDR 0.76 billion (about €0.92 billion or about US$1.15 billion), bringing total disbursements
under the EFF to SDR 15.79 billion (about €19.1 billion or about US$24.02 billion).
The Executive Board also completed today the 2012 Article IV Consultation with Ireland,
which discusses economic policies from a medium-term perspective. The Article IV
consultation occurs on an annual or biannual cycle for all IMF member countries, and this
consultation is distinct from Ireland’s program supported by the EU and IMF.
The arrangement for Ireland, which was approved on December 16, 2010 (see Press Release
No. 10/496), is part of a financing package amounting to €85 billion (about US$106.91
billion), also supported by the European Financial Stabilization Mechanism and European
Financial Stability Facility, bilateral loans from Denmark, Sweden, and the United Kingdom,
and Ireland’s own contributions.
Despite considerable headwinds from an adverse global economic outlook and the ongoing
euro area crisis, the Irish authorities have pressed forward with implementing their economic
program. All end-June 2012 performance criteria and indicative targets for the seventh
review were met, and two structural benchmarks were observed, including a benchmark for
end-September on the introduction of a fiscal responsibility bill to parliament.
The 2012 budget remains on track for the fiscal deficit target of 8.6 percent of GDP, despite a
slowing in real GDP growth from 1.4 percent y/y in 2011 to a projected ½ percent in 2012
owing to weaker trading partner growth. In the year through July, the exchequer primary

2

deficit was 0.7 percent of GDP below that in the corresponding period of 2011. Income tax,
VAT, and corporation tax collections were ahead of expectations, yet this over performance
was partly offset by higher health spending and unemployment benefits. The authorities have
announced corrective measures for health spending.
Financial sector reforms have continued to advance, with the authorities submitting a
restructuring plan for Permanent TSB to the European Commission, and they are preparing a
roadmap to wean banks off the costly Eligible Liabilities Guarantee (ELG) scheme while
preserving financial stability. The authorities introduced a personal insolvency bill to
parliament at end June, and, at the Central Bank’s request, banks are preparing to roll out a
set of loan modification options to address rising mortgage arrears.
On June 29, Euro Area leaders stated that the Eurogroup will examine the situation of the
Irish financial sector with the view of further improving the sustainability of the country’s
well-performing adjustment program. This positive signal helped the Irish government return
to sovereign debt markets, by raising €4.2 billion of new funds in 5-year and 8-year bond
financing in July, with the bulk of the issuance taken up by foreign investors. A further €1.0
billion in 15 to 35 year amortizing bonds was issued in August, tailored to meet domestic
pension fund needs.
Following the Executive Board’s discussion, Mr. David Lipton, First Deputy Managing
Director and Acting Chair, said:
“Half way through Ireland’s extended arrangement, the Irish authorities maintain strong
ownership and implementation of their adjustment program. All program targets for end June
have been met. Benefitting from the strengthened European support signaled at the euro area
summit at end June, Irish bond yields have declined significantly in recent months, and the
country regained access to sovereign bond markets in July.
“Nonetheless, the economic recovery is tentative and unemployment unacceptably high.
Putting the financial sector into a position to support the recovery will require continuing
efforts to return banks to profitability. Lowering funding costs by weaning banks off the
costly Eligible Liability Guarantee scheme in an orderly manner is essential, as is reducing
operational costs. The implementation of strategies to deal with mortgage arrears needs to
continue to move ahead, so the CBI’s plans to monitor banks’ progress are welcome, and
similar frameworks are needed for distressed credit to SMEs. To support these efforts, key
issues for the effective operation of the new personal insolvency framework should be
addressed in a timely manner.
“Sound budget management has continued in 2012 and the authorities should ensure the
effectiveness of measures to contain health expenditure overruns. Yet significant further
consolidation is necessary, so the fiscal responsibility bill and other enhancements of the

3

budgetary framework are welcome. The 2013 budget should focus on high quality measures
that are durable and equitable, and also provide greater clarity on measures to be adopted in
later years.
“Ireland’s rapid return to market financing following the June 29 statement by euro area
leaders confirms the benefits of steps to improve Ireland’s debt sustainability and break the
vicious circle between the banks and the sovereign. Timely agreement on such steps,
especially ESM investments in the equity of Irish banks, offers real prospects for Ireland to
durably exit its reliance on official financing, benefiting Europe as well as Ireland,” Mr.
Lipton said.
