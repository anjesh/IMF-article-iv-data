

Mission. A staff team consisting of M. Takeda (head), L. Papi, R. Guimarães,
J.P. Walsh (all APD), X. Wu (MCM), and S. Panth (Senior Resident Representative)
visited Delhi, Hyderabad, and Mumbai from November 1 to 17, 2010. Messrs. Virmani
and Patra (OED) joined the mission.



Outlook and risks. India’s growth outlook is favorable both in the near and medium
term, as domestic demand drivers remain strong: investment, especially in
infrastructure, is rising rapidly and consumption is buoyed by rising rural incomes and
urbanization trends. Risks stem mainly from weaker global growth.



Key policy issues. The main near-term policy issue is elevated inflation. Achieving the
government’s medium-term fiscal consolidation targets while increasing infrastructure
and social spending will be challenging. A range of reforms are needed, including in
the financial area, to achieve the authorities’ ambitious goals in infrastructure.



Past advice. In the last consultation, the authorities broadly agreed with the Fund’s
advice that India’s vigorous recovery required an earlier exit from the stimulus
implemented during the crisis than most other countries. They also concurred on the
policy priorities over the longer term, chiefly fiscal consolidation and financial sector
reforms.



Exchange rate regime. Floating. India is an Article VIII country, but maintains
restrictions subject to approval under Article VIII: these restrictions have not been
approved by the Executive Board.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
Context: India’s economy has recovered from the crisis and is performing well, but inflation
remains elevated. Robust domestic demand combined with weak growth in advanced
countries is widening the current account deficit. Risks to growth are broadly balanced, with
downside risks relating mainly to the global economy. Capital inflows so far are manageable,
but could complicate macroeconomic management. The medium-term outlook is favorable,
with growth expected to be underpinned by high investment and productivity gains.
Policy messages:


Robust growth and elevated inflation warrant prompt action in completing the
normalization of the monetary and fiscal stance.



Further monetary tightening is needed to meet the RBI’s inflation objectives and
anchor inflation expectations.



The government’s renewed commitment to fiscal consolidation is welcome. Not only
would tighter fiscal policy be the best way of cooling the economy, but this year’s
receipts overperformance offers an opportunity to reconstitute fiscal space faster.



Spending reforms will be critical to square the consolidation objectives with the need
for higher infrastructure and social spending. Implementing the tax reforms in the
works could also contribute.



The authorities are rightly monitoring the current account deficit, as the potential
impact of a reversal in capital inflows has risen.



India’s flexible exchange rate serves the country well in managing capital inflows. If
inflows become excessive, a wide array of tools could be used.



Efforts to facilitate infrastructure investment, especially measures to deepen the
corporate bond market, are bearing fruit and will need to be sustained to meet the
authorities’ ambitious goals in this area.

I.

Context: Rapid Growth and Elevated Inflation

1.
India’s growth remains among the highest in the world. Since mid-2009 the pace
of India’s recovery—led by domestic demand, especially infrastructure investment—has
been strong. Real GDP in Q3 2010 grew at 8.9 percent y/y, with consumption advancing
rapidly as well (Figure 1). With little or no slack in the economy, an incomplete exit from the
policy stimulus introduced during the crisis, and structural factors affecting food prices,
inflation is in the 8½ to 10½ percent range.

2.
The combination of robust domestic demand in India with weak growth and
accommodative policies in advanced economies is widening the current account deficit
and boosting capital inflows. Import growth has outpaced the brisk export expansion
(Figure 2). Capital inflows have offset the current account deficit so that the nominal
effective exchange rate has appreciated only slightly. Unlike several countries in the region,
the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) has barely intervened since November 2009.
3.
The government is focused on high and inclusive growth, with economic reforms
progressing slowly. While India has made substantial progress toward achieving the
Millennium Development Goals, weaknesses remain in some areas, particularly poverty and
malnutrition. The government is pursuing inclusiveness by targeting poverty reduction and
several social indicators. Two broad pillars underpin these goals: expanding social programs
and a big push for infrastructure development. Other reforms—e.g. concerning taxes,
financial legislation, and land acquisition—have been delayed.
4.
Real GDP growth is projected to be above trend at 8¾ percent in 2010/11, with
risks broadly balanced. Infrastructure is likely to remain an important growth driver, and
corporate investment is expected to rise as capacity constraints are emerging and funding
conditions are conducive. Private consumption should contribute substantially, benefiting
from a good harvest after last year’s drought as well as urbanization trends. Downside risks
to growth stem primarily from weaker global growth, while upside risks relate to
accommodative domestic policies maintained for too long. In 2011/12, growth is expected to

5
revert to potential, estimated at about 8 percent. Mostly due to base effects, headline inflation
(WPI) is projected to decline to 6½ percent (March 2011) compared to the RBI's projection
of 5.5 percent; higher food and commodity prices are the key risks. Surging capital inflows
could also complicate macroeconomic management.
Authorities’ Views
5.
While the authorities forecast slightly lower growth for 2010/11, they expect
growth to return to 9 percent quickly. They project this year’s growth at 8.5 percent, but
anticipate a return to potential growth from 2011/12, which they estimate at about 9 percent
given the high investment ratio and the current levels of efficiency in capital use.
6.
The authorities share the view that the main risks stem from global
developments, with a special emphasis on commodity prices. Lower world growth could
dampen the takeoff of corporate investment outside of infrastructure, as a significant portion
of the manufacturing industry is now directly or indirectly linked to global markets. Rising
commodity prices could compound this effect, as well as weigh on the current account
deficit.
II.

Policy Discussions

A. Maintaining Macroeconomic Stability
Is inflation a concern?
7.
Despite some moderation, inflation is high and has become generalized. From a
trough of -0.7 percent y/y in June 2009, WPIinflation surged to double digits in early 2010,
declining to 8.6 percent y/y in October. Core inflation (WPI excluding food and energy) is at
7⅓ percent y/y, well above the RBI’s medium-term objective. CPI inflation (industrial
workers, IW), which has a higher weight on food, is at 9.8 percent y/y. In sequential terms,
both WPI and CPI inflation have picked up again. Inflation expectations are above historical
averages. Given the economy’s momentum and structural pressures on food prices, there are
risks that inflation will exceed staff’s projections and move to a higher plateau.
8.
Staff analysis suggests significant inflation inertia and rapid transmission of
supply shocks to core inflation. India’s inflation is persistent, suggesting that inflation
expectations are backward-looking (Annex 1). As in other developing countries, energy and
food price shocks feed into core inflation, particularly when there is little slack in the
economy.
9.
The RBI has rightly tightened monetary policy, but monetary conditions remain
accommodative. The cash reserve ratio (CRR) has been raised by 100 basis points (bp) and
the repo rate by 150 bp to 6.25 percent since December 2009 (Figure 3). There are several
measures of real interest rates, but short-term real rates using market forecasts remain

6
negative or barely positive and some 75-100bp below the level implied by Taylor rule
calculations (Annex 2). Financing conditions have hardened only marginally as the rupee has
appreciated modestly, capital market issuance has been strong, and lending rates have risen
less than policy rates though the transmission is still in train.
10.
Policy rates need to rise to bring the real repo rate clearly into positive territory
and in line with historical norms. Capacity utilization varies across sectors, but staff
estimate that the output gap has closed, providing little restraint on pricing power, while
fiscal stimulus is only being withdrawn slowly. Services prices and anecdotal evidence
suggest that wages are increasing rapidly. Further, growing rural incomes and an inelastic
food supply indicate that food prices could soon resume their ascent. Boosting agricultural
productivity and reducing policy distortions will also be vital to improve the supply response
of food commodities over the medium term.
11.
The RBI has significantly enhanced its communications. It has increased the
frequency of its policy reviews and in its latest review has provided forward guidance on its
future actions. These welcome developments help manage expectations. To further anchor
expectations, the RBI could publish its one-year ahead inflation forecasts on a rolling basis.
12.
Over time, the RBI could consider giving more weight to the CPI in the conduct
of monetary policy. The WPI is the focus of policymaking, but since 2008 the CPI has at
times diverged considerably from the WPI. As food is a major component of households’
consumption and food inflation affects core inflation, assigning greater weight to the CPI in
policy formulation could increase the impact of monetary policy on inflation expectations.
Also, monetary transmission could be strengthened by reducing the width of the policy rate
corridor and linking administered savings rates to market rates: these issues are being studied
by the RBI.
Authorities’ Views
13.
Inflation remains above the RBI’s comfort level, and recent increases in food
prices may be structural. Consistent with their lower growth projections, the authorities
expect WPI inflation to fall to 5.5 percent by March 2011, but they are concerned about the
rise in inflation expectations. Food inflation is now concentrated in high-protein items that
account for a growing share of the consumption basket due to rising incomes, suggesting that
it is being driven by structural supply-demand mismatches. Higher commodity prices,
quantitative easing in developed economies, and structural food inflation domestically and
world-wide indicate that the risks to inflation are largely on the upside.
14.
Measures introduced since October 2009 are expected to lower inflation. The
transmission of monetary policy has intensified since mid-2010, when liquidity tightened,
pushing the call rate to the upper end of the policy corridor. This, combined with the base
rate reform, has led to higher lending rates, which should increase further as banks’ funding
costs have risen. In addition, some reforms to monetary operations may be implemented after

7
receiving the recommendations of the committee tasked with assessing India’s monetary
policy framework. Hence, the authorities expect inflation to converge to historical averages
of about 5 percent going forward.
15.
The RBI has signaled that the likelihood of further rate actions in the immediate
future is low, but this does not rule out further tightening. Successive rate hikes and the
move of the call rate from the bottom to the top of the policy corridor have brought shortterm market rates close to a level the RBI considers to be right under current circumstances.
Also, falling inflation should bring real interest rates into positive territory by March 2011.
With measures already taken yet to have their full effect on financing conditions, particularly
at longer maturities, and with technical factors expected to lower inflation in coming months,
the RBI is taking stock of the monetary policy transmission that is underway, without
prejudging policy actions at the January Review.
16.
The RBI deems that new WPI index remains the most appropriate inflation
measure for policy purposes. While in the long run it may be desirable to express inflation
objectives in terms of consumer prices, for the time being the new WPI, with a wider
coverage and updated weights, remains the most representative measure of inflation nationwide. Nevertheless, the RBI will continue to evaluate an array of measures of inflation,
including asset prices and surveys of expectations, in pursuit of its inflation-related
objectives.
Is fiscal consolidation sufficient?

proceeds of asset sales and auctions (IMF definition),
however, the deficit would reach 6½ percent of GDP.
The Center’s deficit would thus contract less than
budgeted, and only about a quarter of the combined
fiscal impulse of the past two years would be
withdrawn, making India's consolidation one of the
smallest among emerging markets (EMs), despite its high public debt.

18.
A commendable first step in fuel price liberalization has been taken and
promising tax reforms are in the works. The government has liberalized gasoline prices
and promised eventually to follow suit with diesel prices. The new Direct Tax Code (DTC)
retains some of the current incentives while phasing out the major profit-linked business
exemptions and rationalizes deduction on savings to broaden the tax base. Agreement on the
Goods and Services Tax (GST) has yet to be reached, further delaying the implementation of
a structurally sound and modern indirect tax.
19.
To help reduce overheating and reconstitute fiscal space, overperformance in
receipts should be saved. As the recent global crisis has shown, public finances need to
overperform in good times to reconstitute fiscal space for countercyclical policy. With
several spending measures expiring this year (e.g. 6th Pay Commission arrears), 2010/11
presents an opportunity for greater consolidation, which would facilitate reaching the
2011/12 target. Furthermore, given high government debt and large capital inflows, fiscal
consolidation would be the preferred macroeconomic tool to cool the economy.
20.
The government has reiterated its commitment to fiscal consolidation, but
achieving future deficit targets will be challenging. The 13th Finance Commission (FC)
called for general government deficits to contract by 4 percentage points of GDP between
2009/10 and 2014/15 and public debt to fall from 79 to 68 percent of GDP— the first time
debt is targeted, and a welcome development (Figure 4). At the same time, the FC called for
an increase in capital spending of 2½ percentage points of GDP, and for bringing all subsidy
outlays above the line. The government’s commitment to abide by the FC’s deficit targets
and to reduce debt to 65 percent of GDP is significant, and the envisaged revenue buoyancy
plausible. But the savings assumed in the new Government Debt Report (GDR) on pensions,
wages, subsidies, and interest payments could be difficult to achieve as these areas totaled
only 8 percent of GDP in 2009/10. On the other hand, states are expected to meet the FC's
targets.
21.
Substantial adjustment in current spending will be required to achieve the
proposed medium-term consolidation. International experience suggests that expenditurebased adjustments tend to be more durable, and in India there is significant scope for
rationalization. Much will depend on cutting subsidies, both for fuel and fertilizers, and
better targeting of spending—the latter could be helped considerably by effective use of the
Unique Identification number (UID), which should be exploited as soon as technically
feasible. Over the longer term, greater use of performance-based incentives could improve
social outcomes. The Finance Minister's call for the Comptroller and Auditor General to
report on the quality of expenditure and whether it is achieving its desired objectives is a
welcome development.
22.
Building on recent budget reforms could facilitate consolidation. The GDR
strengthens transparency and India's medium-term budget framework. The authorities could
also detail their plan quantifying how to fit rising capital and social spending into a budget

9
envelope that declines as a share of GDP. To minimize the risk of reversals in consolidation,
amending the Fiscal Responsibility and Budget Management Act as the FC recommended,
including to tighten escape clauses and introduce a fiscal oversight committee, will be key.
Authorities’ Views
23.
The authorities are confident of achieving this year’s consolidation target of
5.5 percent of GDP for the central government deficit. They emphasize that the size of the
supplementary demands for grants is an outcome of the larger-than-expected receipts. They
note that without higher revenue receipts, expenditure would have been kept to budgeted
levels, thereby ensuring that the deficit target would still have been met. Noting that much
additional spending has gone into priority areas such as rural infrastructure, the authorities
emphasize that future spending will remain commensurate with resources. The consolidated
general government deficit (authorities’ definition) is estimated at 9.7 percent of GDP in
2009/10. Gradually declining levels of debt over the medium term ensure sustainability.
Certain characteristics of the existing debt stock, e.g. longer maturity profile, fixed rates, and
the lower share of external debt, coupled with economic factors such as high domestic
savings rate, put India in a distinct category when compared to developed as well as other
EM economies.
24.
The government is committed to the consolidation plan envisaged in the GDR.
The GDR lowers the medium-term debt target to 65 percent of GDP from the 68 percent
recommended by the FC. Further, fiscal consolidation should be seen in the context of
India’s rapid growth. Strong growth will boost revenue, which the authorities expect to
contribute to the envisaged consolidation, along with the expenditure items specified in the
GDR (wages, pensions, interest, and subsidies), which will continue to decline as a share of
GDP.
25.
Streamlining expenditures will be an important contributor to this
consolidation. The authorities expect to continue to reduce subsidies as a percentage of
GDP. Further, growth in social sector programs will be taken up without affecting the fiscal
consolidation process. Finally, the introduction of UID is expected to provide a major boost
to targeting of social programs, both for those currently underway as well as any expansion
of food programs.
Other systemic issues
26.
The current account deficit warrants monitoring. It is projected to reach
3.3 percent of GDP in 2010/11 and 3.5 percent next year (Annex 4). As the deficit rises, so
does the potential impact of a sudden stop or reversal of capital flows, requiring vigilance.
However, investment is the main driver, and the deficit has so far been financed mainly by
FDI and equity inflows. A further rise in the current account deficit can be avoided over the
medium term if India’s exports continue to gain market share and investment leads to higher

10
productivity. Finally, India’s external vulnerability indicators continue to compare well to
other EMs, with external debt at only 20 percent of GDP.
27.
A key risk stems from capital inflows exceeding the country’s absorptive
capacity by a large margin. At 4 percent of GDP during the past year, current inflows do
not appear to pose problems. But with low yields in advanced economies and favorable
growth differentials, capital inflows could become significantly larger. Absorptive capacity is
difficult to pinpoint, but inflows could be deemed to exceed it if they surpass the current
account deficit norm, or put significant pressure on the exchange rate, asset prices, and
monetary and credit aggregates.1

28.
Exchange rate flexibility should continue to be the first line of defense, while
reserve accumulation and selective administrative measures might become appropriate
if inflows surge. According to the IMF’s CGER, the rupee is valued broadly in line with
fundamentals. This is also consistent with

the fact that the real effective exchange

capacity could be expanded by deepening
domestic financial markets, such as by continuing to increase share supply (for example by
increasing the minimum float requirement for state enterprises) and further developing the
corporate bond market. Liberalizing FDI would have similar effects. These measures would
dampen the impact of inflows on asset markets, direct those inflows to productive uses, and
encourage longer-term and less volatile flows. But if the appreciation is persistent and
excessive, and capital inflows too large and volatile, other options can include sterilized
intervention, raising the CRR, and macroprudential measures. India already has a framework
of capital controls, especially on debt, so introducing new controls should be a last resort: if
necessary, existing external commercial borrowing (ECB) regulations could be tightened, as
the authorities have done in the past.

The current account deficit norm for India is estimated to be about 3.5 percent of GDP based on the empirical
relationship between the current account and relative productivity growth, the fiscal position, and demographic
trends.

real estate, which is much less linked to
foreign inflows, has recovered smartly, while the commercial and retail segments remain
soft. The RBI has remained vigilant and recently tightened prudential norms on residential
mortgages. More action could be warranted if asset markets were to become exuberant.
30.
The banking system has been resilient, and vigilance on asset quality and
liquidity risk is being exercised. The recovery has improved the credit profile of
restructured assets, banks have significantly reduced their exposure to unsecured retail
lending, and stress tests indicate that doubling of non-performing loans (NPLs) would leave
banks above the regulatory minimum capital requirement (Annex 5). Market indicators have
improved. Nevertheless, NPLs have inched up and asset/liability mismatches have increased
as deposit growth has lagged credit growth and infrastructure loans and residential mortgages
have expanded the fastest. Monitoring asset quality and raising provisioning coverage remain
priorities, as well as strengthening risk management and credit assessment capabilities,
especially as prudential norms for infrastructure are being eased to promote much-needed
investment in this area.
31.
With the increasing sophistication of the Indian financial system, monitoring
risks in an integrated fashion and ensuring a regulatory level playing field pose
challenges for regulators. Non-bank financial companies (NBFCs) are expanding more
rapidly than banks, infrastructure NBFCs have been introduced, and both interconnectedness
and product competition across institutions are intensifying. The authorities have taken
welcome steps, such as efforts to prevent regulatory arbitrage, the new supervision
framework for financial conglomerates, the introduction of the RBI’s Financial Stability
Report, and the announced review of financial laws and the Financial Stability and
Development Council (FSDC). The FSDC will have to balance the independence of
regulators with the need to resolve regulatory disputes and differences of views on financial
reforms. The forthcoming FSAP could also contribute with a comprehensive assessment of
financial stability and development priorities. The authorities are also encouraged to continue
their efforts toward anti-money laundering and combating the financing of terrorism
(AML/CFT), including by implementing the recommendations of Financial Action Task
Force’s AML/CFT Mutual Evaluation Report.

12
Authorities’ Views
32.
The authorities believe the widening of the current account deficit is transitory.
They agree that if current growth differentials between India and advanced economies
persist, the deficit could be somewhat higher this year and next than in 2009/10. The RBI
deems a deficit above 3 percent of GDP is difficult to sustain over the medium term, and will
focus policies on reducing the medium-term deficit to this level, while ensuring financing for
a larger short-term deficit relies mainly on long-term and stable capital inflows.
33.
Policymakers draw a distinction between the positive role that capital inflows
can play in powering growth, and short-term risks that large and volatile capital
inflows can entail. Current inflows are within the country’s absorptive capacity and some
further increase can be managed with conventional policy responses. At the same time, the
expectation of further quantitative easing in advanced economies could result in large capital
inflows, exchange rate appreciation, and rising asset prices in India as in other EMs. The RBI
will also continue to use macroprudential tools to modulate asset prices. Unlike many other
countries, India has liberalized capital inflows since the crisis in line with the need to finance
investments and its long-term policy objectives, and does not plan to reverse course unless
capital flows exceed current levels by a large margin.
34.
The financial system at the current juncture is largely stable. Concerns about
asset quality are mitigated by high capital adequacy, which exceeds 14 percent with tier one
at 10 percent, and increased provisioning cover. The RBI does not see systemic risks
emanating from a possible increase in NPLs of microfinance institutions. Liquidity risk is
manageable given the statutory liquidity requirement, the CRR, and the fact that the business
model of Indian banks remains centered on retail deposits. The RBI has issued new
guidelines on asset liability management, including management of interest rate risk. Steps
are being taken to strengthen macro-prudential surveillance, minimize regulatory arbitrage
across types of institutions, improve information systems to monitor interconnectedness, and
strengthen supervision of non bank institutions. The FSDC is expected to make an important
contribution in this area.
B. Structural Change and Reform: the Infrastructure Challenge
35.
The Indian authorities have emphasized infrastructure and human capital
investment to reach their goal of 9-10 percent GDP growth over the medium term, and
reiterated this to the G-20. These investments would alleviate supply constraints, as well as
support private demand and contribute to strong, sustainable, and balanced global growth.
Based on a variety of methods, staff currently estimates India’s potential growth rate at
7½-8½ percent. Infrastructure and human capital investment could help raise this.

0
roads, railways, and ports have
lagged. The MTA calls for a
continued sizable increase in
infrastructure investment by 2011/12 to attain the five-year target of around US$500 billion.
The 12th Plan (2012/13-2016/17) has not yet been formulated, but a mooted figure of US$1
trillion would boost infrastructure investment to 9 percent of GDP, while private
participation would be targeted to rise to half the total.
37.
There are several roadblocks to achieving the infrastructure targets and higher
growth. These include availability of finance or financing instruments, for which several
measures have been taken (see below), as well as land acquisition, multiple clearances,
capacity constraints, governance issues, along with various sector-specific concerns.
Structural reforms in these areas would lower the cost of infrastructure, encourage private
investment, and allow more efficient use of public resources.
38.
A staff study shows that in most EMs infrastructure booms are financed
publicly, but private sector participation has risen with increased financial
sophistication (Annex 6). Looking specifically at four major EMs (China, Brazil, Chile, and
Korea) provides some lessons for India. Fiscal consolidation will be important to free public
resources for investment in areas where private participation will not be forthcoming, such as
urban infrastructure and power distribution: Korea and Brazil, especially, have relied on
budgetary resources and public development banks. In China, local governments have played
a key role, including by using proceeds from land premia to defray some costs. Mobilizing
private sector funds in Chile, China, and Korea required a cultivation of institutional
investors, credit enhancements, and reducing regulatory risk, while Chile’s success in
intermediating foreign savings depended on its open business environment and welldeveloped financial markets.
39.
India’s favorable demographics should ensure sufficient domestic savings for
infrastructure investment over the medium term, but foreign savings also need to rise
in the near term. Private savings are likely to continue rising gradually (Annex 7). Public
savings are also expected to rise, but reaching the public sector infrastructure goals while
meeting the fiscal consolidation roadmap will require strict containment of unproductive

14
spending. In the near term, overall domestic savings may be insufficient to meet the
investment increase, necessitating a transitory widening of the current account deficit. To
ensure that foreign capital flows to infrastructure projects, the recent increase in foreign
institutional investors (FII) debt limits is welcome,2 and could be further extended as the
limits approach their full utilization.
40.
Ensuring more efficient intermediation of domestic savings will require
sustained efforts toward financial reforms. Significant progress has been made in
developing the corporate bond market, which has seen increased issuance and turnover. Also,
some takeout finance transactions have taken place and foreign investors have been allowed
to provide credit enhancements. But much greater participation by domestic institutional
investors in the bond market and infrastructure funding is still needed, which depends on
changing investment allocations and reducing the public sector borrowing requirement. At
the same time, credit enhancements will be important to maintain investor protection.
Continuing to boost bond market liquidity and develop securitization and hedging
instruments both remain important to ensure sufficient long-term rupee debt resources are
available to finance India’s investment needs, while helping banks manage their liquidity and
concentration risks. Financial inclusion will allow more savings to be intermediated through
the financial system. The New Pension System will raise contractual savings, but this will
take time.
41.
Large infrastructure projects also raise opportunities for large rents to be
sought by all players, which can be mitigated by robust frameworks and transparency.
Other countries’ experience suggests that large investment drives can be accompanied by
weakening governance standards and incentives can be distorted so that risks are
predominantly borne by the public sector. Strengthening accountability systems, bolstering
transparency, and increasing competition could help mitigate these risks.
Authorities’ Views
42.
The authorities broadly agree with staff’s assessment of India’s progress on
infrastructure. Under the 11th Plan the private sector has contributed about 30 percent of
financing so far, and it is expected that under the 12th Plan private participation will have to
rise to half, making India’s Public-Private Partnership program one of the most ambitious in
the world. The authorities expect a financing shortfall in the coming years unless more longterm debt sources can be mobilized.
43.
Recognizing this, the authorities are engaged in a focused effort to remove the
remaining bottlenecks to the development of the corporate debt market. The authorities
2

In September 2010, FII debt limits were raised by $10 billion in bonds with a residual maturity greater than
5 years.

15
are also working on expanding the domestic investor base, trying to tap retail investors and
increasing bank participation, as well as creating a robust system of market makers.
44.
The authorities’ infrastructure agenda has moved forward in other areas as
well. Land acquisition, particularly in culturally or environmentally sensitive areas, is a
challenge, but the government is considering ways to expedite implementation of
infrastructure projects, while minimizing displacements and improving compensation
assessments. Speeding up approval processes is complicated, but the introduction of
standardized PPP contracts for roads and ports, as well as a national program for capacity
building in PPP formulation at the state level, should begin to ease these bottlenecks.
III.

Staff Appraisal

45.
India’s growth remains among the strongest in the world and its medium-term
prospects are favorable. The economy is expected to grow above trend this year and to
continue to expand rapidly over the medium term, supported by high investment and
productivity gains. Social indicators are improving, consistent with the authorities’ goal of
inclusive growth. Risks to growth are broadly balanced.
46.
Robust growth and elevated inflation warrant prompt action in completing the
normalization of the monetary and fiscal stance. The authorities have started a calibrated
exit from expansionary policies implemented during the global crisis. The overperformance
in this year's central government budget presents an opportunity to reconstitute fiscal space
faster and reduce the risk of overheating, particularly as fiscal policy is the preferred focus
for policy tightening given the high level of government debt and large capital inflows.
Lowering inflation to meet the RBI’s objective requires further monetary
47.
tightening. Over the last year, the RBI has raised policy rates and the CRR, and the
transmission to long-term rates is still taking place. But further increases in policy rates are
needed to bring real short-term interest rates in line with historical norms. India’s controls on
debt flows are expected to dampen the effect of wider interest rate differentials on capital
inflows. More rapid withdrawal of fiscal stimulus would have helped contain demand
pressures, but in its absence, a greater burden falls on monetary policy to cool the economy
and counter prevailing perceptions that inflation has shifted to a higher level.
48.
The government’s renewed commitment to fiscal consolidation is welcome, but
spending reforms will be needed. The government has laid out an ambitious roadmap to
reduce public debt and deficits. High growth is expected to contribute toward this goal, but
the need to raise public investment, especially in infrastructure, and expand social programs
will make this challenging. With the tax reforms designed to be revenue neutral, subsidy
reform will have to continue, especially by liberalizing diesel and fertilizer prices, and
spending efficiency will have to improve. Strengthening budget frameworks along the FC's
recommendations will be important to minimize the risk of reversals in fiscal consolidation.

16
49.
The authorities are rightly monitoring the current account deficit. The current
account deficit has been financed mainly by FDI and equity flows and is expected to narrow
over the medium term as exports expand on the back of productivity gains. However, the
potential impact of a reversal in capital inflows has risen, requiring vigilance.
50.
India's flexible exchange rate serves the country well in managing capital
inflows. So far, the rupee has appreciated only modestly and is deemed to be broadly in line
with fundamentals. Nevertheless, given yield and growth differentials, capital inflows could
exceed India’s absorptive capacity by a large margin. If so, exchange rate appreciation
should remain the first line of defense. Were appreciation to become too large, sterilized
intervention or macroprudential measures could also be taken. Over time, deepening the
corporate bond market, increasing the supply of shares, and further liberalizing FDI would
increase absorptive capacity and the share of relatively stable capital inflows.
51.
Financial policies and reforms are balancing financial stability considerations
with the need to finance investment and growth. Although the financial sector has been
resilient and is benefiting from robust growth, the authorities' vigilance on asset quality and
liquidity risk is appropriate. Deeper interconnectedness, increasing sophistication of the
Indian financial system, as well as the measures taken to promote infrastructure financing,
will continue to put a premium on integrated supervision.
52.
Efforts to facilitate infrastructure investment are bearing fruit and will need to
be sustained to meet the authorities' ambitious goals. While domestic savings are
expected to rise due to India’s favorable demographics and rapid growth, greater recourse to
foreign savings is also likely needed in the near term. More efficient intermediation of
domestic savings will require continued financial reforms, chief among these a vibrant
corporate bond market, which has shown considerable development. Lowering the costs of
doing business—especially by streamlining land acquisition, addressing governance issues,
and reducing red tape—is also critical to boost private sector participation in infrastructure.
53.
It is recommended that the next Article IV consultation take place on the
standard 12-month cycle.

ANNEX 1. INFLATION DYNAMICS IN INDIA1
Introduction
1.
Since 2007, India’s inflation has been
trending upwards. During 2000-09, India’s
consumer price inflation (CPI industrial
workers, IW) averaged 5½ percent, but
9.5 percent in 2008-09. This compares with
2 percent in China, 7 percent in Brazil, and
14 percent in Russia.

declined after 2005. But with the increase in
international commodity prices and domestic food prices and their respective volatilities, the
variability of inflation (measured by the 12-month rolling standard deviation) increased
twofold, from 2 percent before 2005 to an average of 4 percent in 2008-09.
3.
Despite the existence of administered prices in key components of the WPI and
CPI baskets as well as other distortions, headline inflation is significantly correlated
with international commodity prices. First, the energy (fuel) component of the WPI
comoves strongly with international oil prices.
The comovement is stronger when international
oil prices are lagged by three months. Second,
the domestic energy component of the WPI is
also significantly correlated with domestic core
inflation, suggesting that movements in
domestic underlying inflation have occurred in
tandem with shocks to international oil prices.
In the case of food, the correlation between
international food prices and domestic prices is
much smaller and is more volatile. The lack of
comovement between international and domestic food prices stems primarily from barriers to
trade, price controls, and other public policies.

New Keynesian Phillips Curve (NKPC) Estimates for India
4.
To shed light on inflation dynamics, this annex estimates a NKPC for India. The
NKPC framework is useful to assess quantitatively the role of inertia, demand and supply
factors in the inflation process. According to the NKPC, inflation is given by
Πt = λmct + βEtΠt+1
where Πt = pt – pt-1 , λ = (1 – θ)(1 – βθ)/θ, with theta being the probability that prices remain
unchanged in a given period and beta being the discount factor. In the case of the augmented
NKPC, a lagged inflation term is added,
Πt = λmct + γfEtΠt+1 + γbΠt-1
5.
Empirically, the model requires a proxy for the marginal cost term and proper
treatment of inflation expectations. Gali and Gertler (1999) use the labor share of income
as a proxy for marginal costs, but here the output gap is used in the estimations because of
data availability. In the case of expected inflation, survey based data could be used or the
equation can be estimated by Generalized Method of Moments (GMM) techniques, which
instruments expected inflation with past inflation and other exogenous variables (generally
lagged regressors). In the case of India, a continuous and reasonably long sample of expected
inflation is not available and the NKPC is estimated by GMM. To account for the openness
of the economy to international trade, further modifications are made. In an open economy,
marginal costs faced by firms are directly affected by imported inputs, and the NKPC is
augmented with a measure of import prices or international commodity prices. Three
measures are considered, but the estimated coefficients are robust to the measures used in the
estimations: (1) an index of oil prices in domestic currency; (2) the index of fuel and non-fuel
commodity prices in domestic currency; and (3) the same index as in (2) relative to domestic
CPI for industrial workers (IW), which proxies wage costs.
6.
The NKPC is fitted to headline (WPI) inflation and to core (WPI excluding food
and energy) inflation. The inflation measure used is the quarter-on-quarter annualized
change of the price index. The data are seasonally adjusted prior to estimations and span
1996-Q2 to 2010-Q1. Alternative measures of the output gap are used in the estimations
(factor costs GDP, factor costs GDP excluding agriculture, and market price GDP). The
baseline estimates presented below are for core inflation and the output gap is calculated
from non-agriculture GDP at factor costs.
7.
The analysis of inflation dynamics using the NKPC suggests that in the case of
India both forward-looking and backward-looking inflation are important
determinants of inflation (Table 1):

32


Inflation inertia is significant, as the coefficient of lagged inflation is generally large
(positive) and statistically significant. The estimated effect of lagged inflation on
current inflation typically exceeds 0.70 and is about two to three times as large as that
of expected inflation.



Expected inflation also has an effect on current inflation, but it is smaller than past
inflation: a one percentage point increase in expected inflation leads to 0.2 to 0.4
percentage point increase in inflation depending on the specification.



The effect of the output gap on inflation is generally economically significant and
ranges between 0.4-0.8 across specifications. Its statistical significance, however,
depends on the measure of inflation used and to a smaller extent, also on the output
gap measure used.



International commodity prices are an important cost push factor and exert an effect
on inflation beyond that incorporated in expectations or past inflation.



Domestic food prices also act as a cost push factor, with a one percentage point
increase in food inflation translating into 0.15 percentage point increase in core
inflation. Although not statistically significant in all specifications, the inclusion of
domestic food prices improves the fit of the model. The coefficient on food inflation
remains broadly unchanged when a backward-looking version of the PC is estimated.
In addition, the long term response of core inflation to a one percentage point
increase in food inflation is in the order of 0.4 percentage points. This is consistent
with the view outlined in Gokarn (2010) that food prices “have been a major driver of
domestic inflation over the past few years”.

The in-sample fit of the openeconomy NKPC is good. The empirical
model captures the turning points in core
inflation reasonably well. Yet, the model
under-predicts inflation in the last quarter of
2009 and first quarter of 2010. The fit is
also marginally worse when the commodity
price measure is not included.

The important role of food prices
9.
in driving inflation in India becomes
clearer once inflation is disaggregated
into its food and nonfood components.
India: Actual and Simulated Inflation
The volatility of food price shocks is higher
and large upward shocks are more common
and persistent. In addition, the transmission
mechanism between food and nonfood
prices is stronger than in rich countries
(APD REO, Fall 2010, Box 2.1). The large
food price shocks observed in recent years
in India could thus be expected to have a
substantial effect on headline inflation. For
example, between September 2008 and July
2010, food prices rose rapidly due to a poor
monsoon and rising rural incomes. If these price shocks had been transmitted to nonfood
prices in the way food price shocks are transmitted in the United States, overall inflation
would have been only 3 percent during this period.

The importance of food prices for the determination of inflation also has
10.
normative implications. This is challenging for inflation modelers since, as shown by
Gokarn (2010), the interplay between the dynamics of different types of food items and
overall food inflation also reflects rapidly changing spending patterns on food. Nonetheless,
Prasad and Anand (2010) show that when food is a major part of the consumption basket and
in the presence of financial frictions , such as when a large share of households are credit
constrained, a welfare-maximizing central bank should target headline CPI inflation, while
assigning some weight to the output gap. This is relevant in India because the share of food
expenditure in total spending is high and the ability to smooth consumption may be limited.

34
Conclusions

11.

The main findings can be summarized as follows:


India’s inflation has increased recently, with both demand and supply factors playing
important roles.



Unlike food prices, which are driven by domestic factors, the comovement between
the energy component of headline inflation and lagged international prices is strong.
Also, domestic energy inflation is highly correlated with headline inflation.



Phillips curve estimates suggest that the backward-looking component of inflation
expectations is large, but that the output gap and (forward looking) expected inflation
are also important to understanding inflation dynamics.



International commodity prices help deliver a good fit, but their effect on core and
headline inflation operates with long lags.



The inclusion of domestic food prices as a second cost-push factor improves the insample fit of the model.



In poorer countries, food prices are found to be more volatile and to spillover onto
nonfood prices more than in richer countries.

ANNEX 2. ASSESSING THE RBI’S MONETARY POLICY STANCE

1.
The RBI has been withdrawing monetary accommodation since late 2009.
Initially, the RBI raised the Statutory Liquidity Requirement to its pre-crisis level
(25 percent) and eliminated or reduced special liquidity facilities introduced during the crisis.
Since the beginning of 2010, the RBI has raised its repo (reverse repo) policy rate by 150
(200) basis points and the cash reserve ratio (CRR) by 100 basis points. The RBI has
communicated to markets that the normalization of monetary conditions is needed given that
the recovery is consolidating and inflation pressures have become more broad-based. The
RBI has recently provided forward guidance on its future actions, including by signaling a
pausing of interest rate hikes in the immediate future.
Short-term money market rates have increased by more than the policy rates. In
2.
addition to the changes in the policy rates, the call money rate (which until April was
hovering near the bottom of the policy corridor) also rose to the top of corridor as interbank
liquidity became scarcer.2 The RBI has also taken measures to alleviate the liquidity
shortage, including by allowing banks to use up to 2 percent of their portfolio of government
securities to borrow from special liquidity adjustment facility windows (effectively lowering
the SLR by 2 percentage points).
Despite the interest rate hikes, several indicators suggest that monetary
3.
conditions remain accommodative.

1



Short-term interest rates remain low by historical standards. The RBI has only
partially reversed the interest cuts it put in place during the crisis (it had cut the
reverse repo rate by 275 basis points (bps) and the repo rate by 425 bps), despite a
return to close to pre-crisis growth and the rapid rise in inflation.3



Short-term rates remain negative in real terms. With the latest headline inflation at
8.6 percent y/y, the real call money rate is still at -2.3 percent, between 350-500 basis

Prepared by Roberto Guimarães.

2

Some of the variation in liquidity was widely anticipated and resulted from the payment of 3G license and
broadband wireless spectrum auctions as well as tax payments. However, tight liquidity has persisted.

3

Short-term interest rates have been generally higher (at 8-9 percent) when the economy is in a cyclically strong
position (e.g., when output gap is estimated to be closed or positive). For instance, in June 2008, the call money
rate was around 8.5 percent while growth was slightly below the current pace (7.8 percent in 2008Q2 versus
8.8 percent in 2010Q2) and CPI inflation was near 8 percent y/y. The analysis in Box III.2 in RBI (2010)
suggests that “a neutral rate approximated in terms of the call rate over a medium term horizon provides a broad
reference point for assessing the stance of monetary policy.”

36
points below its historical average (about 1½ percent). Bank deposit rates are also
well into negative territory. At their current levels short-term rates would remain
negative for the rest of the fiscal year, as inflation is only projected to decline
gradually to around 6.5 percent y/y by March 2011 and 6 percent (average) in
2011/12. Even using the RBI’s inflation projection of 5.5 percent for March 2011
would still leave the real repo rate at 0.75 percent, whereas measures of the natural
real rate are generally above that level (especially for a rapidly growing economy).

Interest rates are also low according to standard Taylor-rule benchmarks. Taylor
rule calculations suggest that the short-term interest rate is below its neutral levels or
historical benchmarks accounting for the output gap and inflation. Taylor rules are
estimated with data covering 1996-2010. Two Taylor rules are used:4 (i) a benchmark
“calibrated” Taylor rule in which the

are similar to that of the seminal

significant inertia in policy rates; and

(ii) an estimated rule with India data.
The calibrated rule shows that the call

actual rate
money rate is some 100 basis points
below the rule-implied level, while the
estimated one puts this discrepancy at 75 basis points.
May-06



Despite some moderation in inflation in recent months, inflation expectations
4.
have drifted upwards.

4

The 3-month T-bill rate is used in the estimation because it is empirically indistinguishable from the call
money rate, but does not have the spikes and higher volatility of the latter. Using the call money rate in the
estimations yields the same coefficients of the Taylor rule, but reduces the fit of the equation and increases the
standard error of the coefficients.

5

The calibrated rule has the following responses to the inflation gap and output gap: 1.5 and 0.5. In the
estimated rule, the responses are 0.7 and 1.6. The inertial component of the estimated rule is also higher
compared to the calibrated one: 0.9 versus 0.75. The optimal rule in Anand et al. (2010) also displays a high
degree of inertia, but it also includes the exchange rate. Some of the rules estimated by Patra and Kanpur (2010)
show a stronger response to inflation over longer horizons.

37


One-year ahead expected inflation from professional forecasters have increased by a
full percentage point between March 2009 and March 2010. Moreover, since early
2010, the distribution of expected inflation from Consensus Forecasts has shifted to
the right and became more fat-tailed,
pointing to increased uncertainty.

Expectations of longer-term inflation
have also increased. Since early 2010,
ten-year ahead expected inflation
measures (CPI and WPI) from the RBI
survey of professional forecasters have
increased by about 1 percentage point
to 5.5-6.5 percent (annual inflation),
well above the RBI’s medium-term
objective of 4-4.5 percent. Surveys also show that households’ perceptions of
inflation have also risen.

There is little slack in the economy and the output gap is significantly correlated
with inflation, suggesting a return of pricing power.


The measures of the output gap show that the rapid rebound from crisis has virtually
eliminated the gap between actual and potential GDP. While in 2007-08 GDP was
advancing faster than its potential growth rate, in early 2009 there was substantial
slack in the economy. With the swift rebound in growth, the output gap is estimated
to have closed. More importantly, while it is difficult to measure the size of the
output gap with precision, all measures point in the same direction. This is also
consistent with a measure of the output gap that excludes agriculture.



India’s inflation is correlated with the output gap. The correlations range from
0.15 percent in the case of WPI inflation to
0.22 percent in the case of core inflation
(WPI excluding food and energy), both
measured in sequential terms.6 (The
sample spans 1996-Q2 until 2010-Q1 and
is constrained only by data availability).
Phillips curve estimates also indicate that a
one percentage point increase in the output
gap could increase inflation by
0.8 percentage points (see Annex 1).

ANNEX 3. INDIA: FISCAL DEVELOPMENTS AND PROSPECTS FOR CONSOLIDATION1
Background

1.
After two years of very high deficits, the 2010/11 budget was intended to begin the
process of fiscal consolidation. General government deficits in 2008/09 and 2009/10
exceeded ten percent of GDP, while central government deficits exceeded 6¾ percent of
GDP. The 2010/11 budget of the Center began the process of consolidation recommended by
the 13th Finance Commission (FC) and reiterated by the November 2010 Government Debt
Report. State government budgets were also expected to improve as the recovery came
underway.
2.
Since then, revenues have rebounded strongly, but rising expenditures have
necessitated supplementary budgets . The August and November supplementary demands
for grants amounted to 1.3 percent of GDP2.








Revenue growth has been quite strong in the recovery from the crisis. Despite rate
reductions, personal income tax collections are on track to exceed their 2007/08 peak
as a share of GDP, and the revival of corporate profits and foreign trade has buoyed
corporate income taxes and customs revenue. A partial rollback of the excise tax cut
taken during the crisis has also supported indirect tax revenues.
Current expenditure. Non-interest current expenditure was slated to grow by 3.4 y/y
percent in 2010/11, but in the first half of the year rose by 14.7 percent.
Subsidies, which reached 2.3 percent of GDP in 2008/09, were budgeted to fall to
1.6 percent in 2010/11, with only a nominal amount for fuel subsidies. This has not
yet materialized, however, and even with the hikes to market prices for fuels and
liberalization of gasoline prices undertaken in June 2010, subsidies in 2010/11 are
still expected to be around 2 percent of GDP.
Capital spending. Nonmilitary capital spending was budgeted to rise by 18 percent:
its growth so far exceeds this rate.
One-off proceeds from the government’s auctions of 3G and broadband licenses as
well as divestment have been positive. The 3G auction raised twice its expected target
of Rs 350 billion. The government budgeted proceeds from divestment of shares in
public enterprises of Rs 400 billion for 2010/11, and this target is likely to be easily
met3.

Prepared by James P. Walsh

2

It should be noted that of these supplemental requests, Rs 85 billion (0.1 percent of GDP) was earmarked for
India’s IMF quota increase.

3

The Indian government classifies the proceeds of the wireless and broadband auction licenses, as well as
proceeds from share sales, as revenue while IMF guidelines call for its classification as financing.

40




State budgets are expected to contribute to fiscal consolidation this year as receipts
revive and spending, which rose by less than central government spending during the
crisis, remains under control. The 2009/10 deficit estimated at 3.7 percent of GDP
should improve this year to around 3.3 percent of GDP.
Current IMF staff forecasts place the deficit above the budgeted target; however,
this is not the case under the authorities’ methodology, which includes the proceeds
of various asset sales as revenue.

Tax Reforms

3.
The government hopes to introduce a nationwide Goods and Services Tax (GST) in
April 2012. The tax, which will be implemented as a value-added tax, is intended to replace
India’s web of state- and national level excise, sales and value added taxes with a unified
consumption-tax framework, and to move from origin- to destination-based taxation. Some
important features of the tax as currently proposed are:






The central government will tax goods at 10 percent, services at 8 percent, and
essential items at 6 percent, with the recommendation that the states add identical
rates4.
Within three years these rates are expected to converge to 8 percent.
The entire consumption base will be taxed by bringing imports into the base while
excluding exports. Businesses with annual sales below Rs 1 million will be exempt.
While many indirect taxes levied by the states and the central government will be
subsumed into the GST, taxation of fuels and alcohol will remain outside the GST for
the time being.

The reform is designed to be revenue neutral, but its simplification relative to the
4.
current system should increase revenues in the long run. The current proposal is similar to
the “Model GST” proposed by the FC with a few exceptions, such as the lack of a uniform
rate (though this is temporary), and a slightly longer list of exemptions. Revenues will be
shared between the central government and the states, but the FC recommended that states
which collected more revenue under the current tax structure (both from state level excise
taxes and their share of revenues from the central government sales tax) be compensated for
losses until 2014/15. The replacement of India’s distortionary current system with the more
streamlined GST is expected to increase compliance, and could have a positive impact on
growth.
Approval of the GST will be a prolonged process. Changing the allocation of
5.
taxation responsibilities from the states to the central government requires a constitutional
4

That is, the total rate on goods would be 20 percent. Rates would be fixed nationwide, with the revenue pool
for the states allocated according to Finance Commission Recommendations.

41
amendment. This would have to pass with a qualified supermajority in Parliament and then
be approved by a majority of the states. As the Parliamentary opposition and many state
legislatures have raised objections to various aspects of the legislation, the prospects for
passage are not clear. After approval of the amendment, a GST bill based on this proposal
would be tabled in Parliament and would require only a majority vote.
Parliament is expected to pass a new Direct Tax Code (DTC) soon. The DTC is
6.
intended to modernize the framework for income and corporate taxes in India, which was last
updated in 1961. By limiting deductions, the draft tax code aims at increasing the tax base,
allowing for a reduction in tax rates while collecting a similar level of revenues. It is
expected to come into effect on April 1, 2012. Some important components of the legislation
are:
Corporate Income Tax





Despite initial proposals to reduce the rate to 25 percent, the corporate income tax
rate has been maintained at 30 percent. However, the elimination of various cesses
and surcharges will reduce the effective rate.
Residence of corporations will be determined by their place of “effective
management.”
Corporate book profits will be taxed, rather than corporate assets or realized profits,
as originally proposed.

Personal Income Tax





Capital gains will now be taxed as income, and foreign investors without labor
income will be taxed at the equivalent marginal rate on earnings, though a deduction
from the base will apply on assets held for more than one year. Capital gains taxes
will not apply to equity shares held for more than one year.
Retirement and certain other long-term savings will be taxed neither when earned nor
when withdrawn; reinvested capital gains will also not be taxed.
The narrower tax brackets included in the 2010/11 budget have been slightly
modified, furthering lowering marginal tax rates on some income ranges.

Inclusive Growth and Fiscal Costs

7.
Given its relatively low social indicators compared to other countries, the Indian
government supports a broad range of social programs. Compared to other major emerging
markets (EMs), as well as other countries in the region, and despite rapid growth in recent
years, India’s social indicators remain comparatively weak (Table 1). Hence, social spending
is an important priority. However, spending on subsidies, primarily on fuels and fertilizers,
but also on food, accounts for a share of general government spending comparable to that of
health and rural development combined.

The government has announced
8.
numerous expansions to social programs.
In recent years, the government has sought
to broaden the reach of programs aimed at
improving rural livelihoods and the
education system, and is likely to expand
its subsidized food programs. Widening
scope of social safety nets is an important
step in improving human welfare. But
reconciling the expansion of these
programs with the government’s
commitment to reduce overall spending
will be a challenge.

The flagship National Rural Employment Guarantee Act (NREG) is large, though
9.
the cost at present is manageable. NREGA, passed in February 2006 and fully implemented
across rural India in 2008, provides 100 days of work to any rural household that requests it.
In 2010/11, the program’s budget is Rs 401 billion (0.5 percent of GDP). Wages under
NREG are low, averaging around Rs 90 per day in 2009/10, but have risen over time,
including a recommendation earlier this year that wages be raised to Rs 100 a day or linked
to states’ minimum wages. The program is extensive – in 2009/10, 53 million households
requested employment under the scheme –and the government is increasing awareness of the

43
program. However, the government sees this as a safety net rather than a program that will
displace regular employment.
10.
The uneven implementation of NREG across India points to a large scope for its
expansion, which could be costly. In the five states in which NREG has enrolled the largest
percentage of poor households, the program has enrolled around 85 percent of working age
poor persons5. In the rest of the country, only 21 percent of the working age poor have been
enrolled. The cost of expanding NREGA in those states with relatively low penetration to the
same level the program has attained in the most implemented states would be around
0.8 percent of GDP. Implementation on this broader scale would thus more than double the
current cost of the program. Tying wage rates to minimum wages could also raise costs.
The 2009 Right to Education Act (RTE) could prove another major fiscal
11.
undertaking. The law sets a goal of ensuring universal high quality education for children up
to age 14. In early years much expenditure under the program is likely to come under the
auspices of the Sarva Shiksha Abhiyan (SSA) program, which has similar but narrower goals.
Implementation will be shared between the central government and the states. There is
already a broad range of support for education. The five states with the highest 2007 literacy
rates, averaging 95 percent, budgeted Rs 6100 per child on education in 2009/10, while the
rest of the states (with a combined literacy rate of 68 percent) budgeted on average Rs 4200
per child6. Improving literacy, rather than equalizing state spending on education, is the goal
of RTE. But as a guideline, raising per child expenditures for the 23 states with the lowest
literacy rates to the same level as those with the highest literacy rates would entail additional
costs of 0.9 percent of GDP.
Finally, the Food Security Act (FSA) is on the horizon. The FSA has no timetable
12.
yet for approval and is only now being fleshed out. The main point of the program would be
to provide 35 kg of rice or wheat each month to eligible households at a subsidized cost of Rs
3 a kilo7. It is not clear how broad the expansion of current programs will be: a recent
increase in the poverty line raised the estimate of poor households from 64 to 85 million,

5

Staff estimates for this and further calculations below based on data from NREGA, the Census of India, the
Planning Commission, and the Reserve Bank of India’s Report on State Finances 2010/11. Given their different
treatment under India’s anti-poverty programs, the Northeastern states were excluded from the NREGA
analysis; the five states with the highest level of participation are Andhra Pradesh, Himachal Pradesh,
Karnataka, Rajasthan and Tamil Nadu.

6
7

The states with the highest literacy rates are Goa, Himachal Pradesh, Kerala, Mizoram and Tripura.

Under current policies, households below the poverty line pay slightly higher prices (Rs 4.2 per kilo for wheat
and Rs 5.7 for rice) for the same quantities, though 25 million households pay even lower prices under a
program called Antyodaya Anna Yojana (AAY) and additional support programs exist for children, the elderly,
and the working rural poor.

44
while even broader criteria have also been discussed, including some that would make
subsidized food grains universally available in poorer parts of the country.
13.
Such a large expansion of the social safety net should be undertaken with a view
toward increased efficiency of implementation. Leakages from social programs are difficult
to quantify, but estimates of losses are often quite large. A 2008 report by the Comptroller
General on NREG noted many discrepancies and a lack of transparency about how the
program was implemented in many parts of the country8. A similar report in 2006 on the
national food distribution system, which under some proposals would become the
implementing mechanism for the Food Security Act, found that many persons eligible for the
program were denied ration cards, and that many who did were unable to use the service on a
regular basis9. Another study finds not only that two-thirds of publicly distributed wheat does
not reach eligible persons, but that this percentage varies dramatically by state, implying that
more efficient distribution can cut losses10. On the other hand, the National Population
Register and introduction of the Unique Identification number (UID) is expected to help
reduce leakages and increase social safety net efficiency.
Outlook for Medium-Term Consolidation

14.
The report of the 13th Finance Commission focused on fiscal consolidation but laid
out other important fiscal reforms. FC reports are published every five years. This year’s
report contained a number of significant proposals to enhance long-term fiscal sustainability:




For the first time, a public sector debt target was established, at 68 percent of GDP
(45 percent for the central government, both slightly above what the IMF had
recommended), with a path of fiscal consolidation for the central and general
governments (Table 2).
The FC also recommended:
o increasing central government borrowing and revenue sharing during
downturns rather than raising states’ borrowing limits;
o establishing an independent review mechanism to evaluate fiscal reforms;
o the Medium Term Fiscal Plan required under the Fiscal Responsibility and
Budget Management Act (FRBMA) be “made a statement of a commitment
rather than a statement of intent”;
o amending the FRBMA to spell out clearly under what circumstances its
targets could be relaxed;

patterns of Indian state and central

represents an important step forward for transparency. By enumerating specific areas for
savings and presenting a five-year path for spending and revenues based on bottom-up
estimates, it also furthers the authorities’ goal of moving Indian fiscal policy into a mediumterm timeframe.
Attaining these goals will be challenging. With tax reforms intended to be revenue

neutral, capital spending slated to increase given India’s infrastructure demands, as well as
the country’s pressing social needs, fiscal consolidation must rest on tight control of
nonproductive expenditure. Fund research also suggests that current expenditure has a lower
multiplier than tax or development expenditure.11Spending on interest, defense and transfers

to states, areas where cuts are likely off the table, accounts for 40 percent of total 2010/11
spending (Figure 2). Capital expenditure accounts for an additional 5 percent. Non-subsidy
social spending, which if streamlined would serve more people at current cost levels,
accounts for an additional 16.5 percent. Since 2004, spending in the remaining areas,
including subsidies, has risen on average by 17 percent per year. Based on Fund staff
forecasts for revenue and spending in other categories, growth in these areas would have to
fall to 13 percent between 2010/11 and 2014/15. As high as that growth rate is, it is already
likely out of reach for 2010/11 despite various one-off items that were falling off (e.g., 6th
Pay Commission arrears and the farmers’ debt waiver).
17.
The recent subsidy reform is a step in the right direction. The 2010/11 budget
rationalized subsidies for fertilizers by moving the basis from reimbursement from the
product itself to its nutrient content. In June, wholesale prices for kerosene and LNG were
raised by 33 and 11 percent, respectively, while the price of diesel was raised by 5 percent,
though the government reserved the right to reverse these measures if international oil prices
climb to excessive levels. Gasoline prices were fully liberalized with immediate effect, and
the government announced its intention to follow up with a freeing of diesel prices. All these
measures have long been supported by the Fund. Raising these prices reduced the likely
subsidy bill for the remainder of 2010/11, while the full liberalization of gasoline, and
eventually diesel prices, will reduce the variability of subsidies in the future, reducing
ongoing fiscal risks. With fertilizer and fuel subsidies still likely to cost 1.2 percent of GDP
in 2010/11, a substantial reduction in these outflows would be an important contribution to
fiscal consolidation.

ANNEX 4. CURRENT ACCOUNT AND EXTERNAL STABILITY1

1.
India’s current account deficit has widened since mid-2009, as the domestic
recovery gathered momentum. The current account deficit (CAD), which averaged
1.1 percent of GDP in the three years prior to the crisis, increased to 3.7 percent of GDP in
2010Q2. The CAD is expected to remain at 3-3.5 percent of GDP over the next couple of
years as trading partners’ demand is projected to grow by less than India’s domestic demand.
Moreover, India’s investment is anticipated to continue to increase, partly due to a big
infrastructure push.

meanwhile, has also been rapid, particularly of capital goods. In terms of secular trends,
India exports have risen as a share of world exports (goods and services), reflecting gains in
productivity and increased integration with the global economy.
The rise in the current account deficit has been accompanied by a domestic

investment boom. India’s domestic recovery has been led by investment. Trends since
2005 also show that the rise in the investment to GDP ratio has been accompanied by a
widening CAD. Gross fixed investment rose from 31 percent of GDP in 2006/07 (when the
CAD was 1 percent of GDP) to 32½ percent in 2009/10, as the CAD rose to nearly 3 percent
of GDP. Further, domestic consumption growth has remained subdued, and the consumption
share of GDP has been declining steadily since the early 1990s to 57 percent of GDP in
2009/10, almost 9 percentage points below the level recorded in 2004.

4.
The external debt sustainability analysis (ext-DSA) provides a benchmark to
gauge the sustainability of the CAD. Given India’s low external debt (about 20 percent of
GDP), the non-interest CAD that stabilizes external debt is in the order of 4 percent of GDP,
compared to a non-interest CAD of 2.2 percent in 2009/10. While the baseline ext-DSA
provides a useful benchmark, it does not take fully into account the potential perverse
dynamics that often arise when countries run large and protracted CADs. For instance,
interest rates on the external debt generally spike as domestic growth slows unexpectedly
due to an adverse external shock. In India’s case, given the high average growth and low
external debt, even a combination of adverse shocks would still leave external debt under
30 percent of GDP.
India’s CAD is at present broadly in line with its norm. Since it is the equilibrium
5.
level of the CA consistent with medium-term fundamentals (such as relative growth,
demographic trends, and fiscal position), the CA norm posits the level of current account
that can be financed by capital flows with no reserve accumulation and an exchange rate in
equilibrium. The fall 2010 CGER estimates India’s CAD norm at 3.4 percent of GDP.3
While the projected CAD is expected to be close to the norm in 2010/11 and 2011/12 at
around 3.3-3.5 percent of GDP,4 over the medium term the CAD is expected to decline to
2-2.5 percent of GDP as import growth moderates in line with overall economic growth and
productivity gains in the tradable sector further spur export growth.
India’s CAD is particularly sensitive to oil prices and growth differentials. The
6.
income elasticity of the trade balance is higher in the case of foreign income compared with
domestic income, based on an error-correction model (ECM) estimated for 1980-2009. The
sensitivity of the current account balance to oil prices is large: a $10 increase in oil prices
(about 12 percent) would lead to an increase in the CAD of about 0.6 percent of GDP. A
3

This suggests that according to the macroeconomic balance approach, the real effective rupee is slightly
undervalued, but the average of estimates in the CGER suggests that the rupee is in equilibrium.

4

The projections are broadly in line with the mean of Consensus Forecasts released in November, which show a
deficit of 3.3 (3.5) percent of GDP in 2010/11 (2011/12).

49
10 percent depreciation of the rupee is
estimated to lower the trade balance by 0.2
percent of GDP in 1½-2 years.

inflows. FDI has recently averaged 1-1.5
percent of GDP, covering nearly half of the
FDI as percentage of current account deficit
recent CADs and has proved resilient during
current account in percent of GDP (right scale)
the global crisis. With India’s high growth
continuing to attract significant FDI
inflows,5 FDI could finance a third of India’s CAD, even if the latter were to remain in the
range of 3-4 percent of GDP. Portfolio equity investment has financed about a third of the
CAD in recent years, but has been more volatile than FDI. Despite occasional spikes in
volatility, FDI and portfolio equity inflows should remain strong over the medium term, as
India’s growth should continue to outpace that of the rest of the world.
Although India’s CAD is expected to be more than fully financed by projected
8.
capital inflows, a reversal of the latter could lead to disruptive adjustments. Capital
flow volatility, particularly in $ terms, has increased, which could lead to sizable
adjustments in domestic investment in the case of a sudden stop in inflows or large outflows
as in 2008/09. Portfolio equity flows have been strongly associated with investment, and a
decline in inflows would likely lead to a decline in investment and overall activity growth.6
In the case of a sudden stop in capital inflows, reserves could be used and the exchange rate
could provide some relief, as a depreciation of the rupee would help reduce the trade deficit.
However, the effect of the REER on the trade balance is relatively small and would take
time to materialize.
Several indicators suggest that India’s external vulnerability compares well to
9.
other emerging markets. India has a high reserve coverage (182 percent of short-term debt
and current account deficit), low external debt (94 percent of exports), small private external
debt (15 percent of GDP), and close to equilibrium REER. While India’s vulnerability
seemslow, it is difficult to assess the likelihood of a sudden stop in capital flows.

PSBs would need to raise new capital to support credit growth over the medium

rate of 15 percent, PSBs will require some 3 percent of 2010/11 GDP in new capital in the

requirement rises to 4.3 percent of 2010/11 GDP if the PSBs maintain a CAR of 12 percent.

introduced, but the minimum total capital plus conservation buffer will remain at 8 percent until 2015, with a
phased increase to 10.5 percent at the beginning of 2019.

The financial crisis has had some negative impact on banking profitability.
7.
Banks’ return on equity (ROE) declined to 14.3 percent in 2009/10 from 15.4 percent in
2008/09. Income from securities and foreign currency trading fell considerably as a result of
the financial crisis, but the decline was partially offset by growth in other operating income.
The net interest margin remained broadly unchanged during 2009/10. Nevertheless, banks’
interest expense are on the rise with the recent upturn in deposit rates and the accrual of
interest on savings deposits on a daily basis from April 2010. In addition, banks’
provisioning coverage for NPAs was at 52 percent at the end of March 2010, and the
increase in the provisioning requirement to 70 percent by September 2010 would have put
additional pressure on banks’ profit margins.
Risks to the outlook

8.
Credit risk remains the main risk in the banking system. The credit cycle is just at
the beginning, but some special provisions to stimulate infrastructure financing could result
in lower lending standards. The transition to Basel II, which has raised the CAR for banks by
lowering the risk weights based on external credit ratings, may also give banks a false sense
of strength in their balance sheet and encourage increased risk-taking.

attracting deposits after having raised deposit rates and lending for residential mortgages may
slow after the recent RBI’s measures (see below).

Interconnectedness of banks, MFs, and nonbank financial companies (NBFCs)
10.
has a bearing on funding risks. About two-thirds of MF assets are invested in debt
securities, of which about half are bank CDs. MFs also purchase CPs and bonds issued by
NBFCs—which include leasing companies, housing finance companies, mortgage guarantee
companies and infrastructure finance companies. Therefore, large outflows from mutual
funds could cause funding strains for both banks and NBFCs. In addition, NBFCs also
borrow from banks, and strains in the wholesale market could have negative effect on banks’
asset quality if NBFCs encountered repayment difficulties.

53
Reform initiatives

11.
The authorities have implemented countercyclical capital and provisioning
requirements. At the onset of the crisis, risk weights and provisioning ratios were lowered
on credits to sectors including housing, capital markets and commercial real estate. As the
economic recovery took hold, the provisioning ratio on loans to commercial real estate was
raised from 0.4 percent to 1 percent.
The latest macroprudential measures are aimed at the housing sector. These
12.
include the introduction of an 80 percent cap on the loan-to-value (LTV) ratio on mortgages,
and an increase in the risk weights to 125 percent from 100 percent on mortgages of Rs 7.5
million or more. Also, the provisioning on standard assets has been raised to 2 percent for
mortgages with “teaser interest rates”, loans with an initial low interest rate followed by
higher rates later.
Facilitating infrastructure investment has been a financial reform priority. More
13.
than 80 percent of infrastructure projects are financed by PSBs, which face increasing
asset/liability mismatches because of the extended maturity of infrastructure loans. To
address this issue and provide more infrastructure financing, the India Infrastructure Finance
Co. Ltd. (IIFCL) has implemented a Takeout Financing Scheme to purchase infrastructure
loans from PSBs. The IIFCL is also considering plans to provide guarantees for bond issued
by infrastructure companies. In addition, the authorities have taken several other measures to
enhance infrastructure financing:


A new category of institutions, called NBFC-IFCs, were created, with a minimum of
75 percent of its total assets deployed in infrastructure loans. These NBFCs were
allowed to issue tax exempt bonds.



In September 2010, the limit on foreign investment in corporate bonds was lifted
from $15 billion to $20 billion, with the increment reserved for infrastructure
company bonds with a residual maturity exceeding 5 years.



Commercial banks were allowed not to mark to market bonds issued by infrastructure
companies with a minimum residual maturity of seven years.



Banks were allowed to classify a loan as standard for a maximum of four years
(instead of two) if the infrastructure project cannot start operation on the due date.



The provisioning ratio was reduced from 20 percent to 15 percent for infrastructure
loans classified as sub-standard for which banks have a clear and legal first claim on
the cash flows of the projects.



The risk weights of banks’ exposures to well-rated NBFC-IFCs were lowered by
linking the risk weights to ratings assigned by rating agencies.



The 2010/11 Budget introduced a deduction of an additional amount of Rs. 20,000 on
tax savings for investment in long-term infrastructure bonds.

54
14.
The corporate bond and CP market has expanded quickly. Growth in corporate
bond and CP issuance has outpaced credit growth in recent years partly in response to the
authorities’ reform initiatives, including listing and reporting requirements, higher FII
participation, and repos with corporate bonds.
The amount of listed corporate bonds has
risen 58 percent since December 2008, while
outstanding CP has almost tripled, with
higher trading volumes. Corporate bond
issuance is dominated by highly-rated
companies, especially public sector ones, and
liquidity is limited. Domestic institutional
investors’ participation remains low and
issues surrounding stamp duties and
withholding taxes also hamper market
deepening.

Supervision of financial conglomerates is being strengthened. A mechanism for
15.
monitoring financial conglomerates has been in place since 2004, and the RBI has started
quarterly on-site inspections using the CAMELS framework. An enhanced revised off-site
reporting system has been introduced. Financial conglomerates are now required to deduct
from their capital investments in excess of 20 percent of a subsidiary’s equity, compared with
a previous 30 percent. To prevent regulatory arbitrage, the RBI is seeking convergence of
regulation of banks and financial conglomerates.
The RBI has issued a discussion paper on new banking licenses. The paper
16.
discusses the pros and cons of licensing new banks, allowing the conversion of NBFCs into
banks and allowing large industrial houses to own banks. There are safety, soundness and
legal concerns with non-financial companies owning banks, and the ability to supervise the
banking activity of non-financial companies will be critical. A proper supervisory structure
would be essential, one that requires banking activities of the non-financial group be
conducted within a tiered holding company subject to prudential regulation with thick
firewalls between its banking activities and the group’s other activities.
Regulatory reform is moving forward. Following up on the authorities’ 2009 self17.
assessment on financial stability, the authorities announced in the 2010/2011 budget a
Financial Sector Legislative Reforms Commission to rewrite and streamline financial sector
laws. The government has also proposed a Financial Stability and Development Council
(FSDC) chaired by the Finance Minister to deal with inter-regulatory coordination, financial
stability as well as financial development issues. Close consultation with financial regulators
would be important to dispel any concern about regulatory independence.

ANNEX 6. INFRASTRUCTURE FINANCE: INDIAN CHALLENGES AND COUNTRY EXPERIENCES
India’s Infrastructure: Plans and Challenges

1.
Increased investment in infrastructure is one of the government’s top policy
priorities. India’s 11th Plan (2007/08 to 2011/12) specifies a large increase in infrastructure
investment among its major goals:
The Eleventh Plan (2007-08 to 2011-12) aims at a sustainable growth rate of
9 per cent with emphasis on a broad-based and inclusive approach that would
improve the quality of life and reduce disparities across regions and
communities. There is consensus that infrastructure inadequacies would
constitute a significant constraint in realising this development potential. To
overcome this constraint, an ambitious programme of infrastructure
investment, involving both public and private sector, is being developed for
the Eleventh Plan.1

2.
The 11th Plan aimed at a large shift toward
infrastructure investment. During the period of the
10th Plan, infrastructure investment totaled 5.1 percent

of GDP. A goal of the 11th Plan is to raise this to

Plan. With energy shortages a problem in much of the

56
Progress has been uneven across sectors. The authorities published a Mid-Term
3.
Appraisal of the 11th Plan in mid-2010. With final data available for 2007/08 and 2008/09,
overall infrastructure investment exceeded original targets by a small margin. But private
investment in telecommunications greatly exceeded the original targets, while investment in
roads was disappointing. Moreover, costs in many areas were higher than originally forecast,
mainly due to difficulties with land acquisition and higher capital equipment prices. Despite
the overperformance in investment in power generation capacity, the output target of 78.7
GW has now been reduced to 62 GW.

4.
A further acceleration of infrastructure investment is envisaged for the remainder
of the 11th Plan, and the 12th Plan. To reach the revised 11th Plan targets, infrastructure
investment would likely have to rise from an estimated 7.2 percent of GDP in 2008/09 to
around 8.4 percent of GDP in 2011/12, the final year of the 11th Plan. Additionally, a target
of US$ 1 trillion for infrastructure has been widely discussed for the next Plan, likely
entailing infrastructure investment of 9-10 percent of GDP.
5.
There are roadblocks in the way of this acceleration of investment. Several reports
share many findings, such as:










Finance. The focus on private sector involvement in the 11th Plan has laid bare the
difficulty of financing large infrastructure projects, given India’s bank-dominated
financial system, shallow corporate debt market, capital account controls, and fiscal
dominance. The main constraint is the availability of long-term rupee debt financing
which so far has been provided by banks, exposing them to maturity mismatches. The
authorities have begun to address these constraints (see Annex 5 for recent measures).
Public sector capacity. Many areas where infrastructure investment has lagged
under the 11th Plan (e.g., railway stations, ports, roads) are areas in which PPPs have
been successful in other countries. India has a broad PPP program, but the
authorities’ execution capacity has reportedly been a constraint at times.
Government clearances. Overlapping levels of government and a wide array of
public sector stakeholders have added to implementation risks. Some states, such as
Tamil Nadu, have moved to simplify procedures and unify oversight into a single
office, but such progress has not been broadly imitated.
Land acquisition. Government clearances can be particularly difficult to obtain
where land acquisition is involved, with numerous restrictions related to
environmental, social, political and economic concerns each requiring separate
settlement, sometimes in legal settings. This greatly adds to implementation risk of
projects and discourages foreign companies from entry. A bill in Parliament to
address this has been stalled for some time.
Limited capacity of contractors. There are few domestic companies in India with
the capacity to engage in very large infrastructure projects, and many of which are
subsidiaries of large diversified conglomerates, concentrating risks. Smaller
construction companies face difficulties in hiring skilled labor, dealing with
regulatory complexity and access to finance, while foreign companies are
discouraged by regulatory and implementation risk.

57
Cross Country Analysis

6.
An IMF staff study looks at how other emerging markets have financed
infrastructure investments2. Have countries financed large infrastructure booms via
domestic savings? And if so what has been the role of public versus private savings? If not,
have some countries relied to a large extent on foreign capital? What type of capital financed
infrastructure? Did countries rely more on banks or on capital markets? These are some of
the questions that the study attempts to find answers to. It does so in two parts: in the first,
the study analyzes the behavior of the main macroeconomic variables at times when
countries experienced infrastructure booms. This is based on a large data set, including 105
countries and spanning 1980 to 2009. The second part consists of four case studies of Brazil,
Chile, China, and Korea and aims at providing more insights into the type of financial
instruments used.
Cross Country Macro

7.
A first pass through the data identifies booms in infrastructure investment and
looks at the macroeconomic conditions preceding and during such booms. Highways and
electricity generation are two focal areas for India’s infrastructure push and are also areas in
which the outputs to investment, namely roads and electrical generation capacity, are easily
available3. Booms are identified as three-year periods during which the growth in mileage of
paved roads or installed electrical generation capacity exceeded the unconditional 1980-2009
average by significantly more than 1 standard deviation for roads or ½ standard deviation for
energy. Assessing whether macroeconomic variables during those periods also differed
significantly from their long-run means provides some indication of how infrastructure
booms are financed.
8.
Across many countries, especially developing countries, large investments in
infrastructure are preceded by periods of rapid growth. Rapid growth leads to strains on
energy capacity, driving investment in additional generation. To a lesser extent the same is
true with road construction. Similarly, and as other studies have found, growth is
significantly higher in periods after such large investments in energy and roads.
9.
Energy generation investment is not associated with deteriorating current account
positions, while this is more common for road construction. Investment in energy
generation is generally preceded by strong current account performance, and balances do not
tend to worsen during periods of investment, implying that domestic savings are the marginal
source for finance. Roads investment also tends to be preceded by strong current account
balances, but, for investment in highways, it would appear that foreign savings are more
likely to be tapped, or perhaps that there is more reallocation of domestic savings.
2

C. Park, J.P. Walsh and J. Yu (2010), “Financing Infrastructure in Emerging Markets,” manuscript.

For roads the indicator used is mileage of paved roads, which may be problematic in developed economies
where roads investment is focused on upgrades to already paved roads rather than new construction.

58
Public financing, particularly deficit finance, is important in energy investment.
10.
Booms in energy generation capacity tend to follow periods of improving fiscal balances,
presumably as rapid growth fills government coffers, though this improvement tends to
dissipate during the boom as capital spending rises. For roads the story is somewhat
different: roads investment also tends to lag periods of superior fiscal performance, but roads
do not lead to deficit financing. What seems likely is that energy generation is more of a
political priority than roads or private investors are more likely to invest in roads than in
power generation, leaving the latter to the public.

11.
Periods of rapid investment in energy and roads capacity do not appear to be
linked to periods of unusual expansion of credit, either from banks or in debt markets.
This means only that such infrastructure booms do not lead to appreciable financial
deepening: either the resources harnessed by the private sector are relatively small on
average, or they are diverted from other areas. This diversion could be beneficial, as the
returns to infrastructure investment could be quite high if growth constraints are what lead to
the boom.
12.
A closer look at how four other emerging market countries have financed
infrastructure shows highly heterogeneous experiences. The effects discussed above are
averages across countries, and conceal important differences in how countries have
addressed the issue of infrastructure constraints. The lack of significance of private sector
financial variables is also somewhat disappointing, given the focus in many countries on
additional private sector involvement in infrastructure. Staff analysis therefore looked in
detail at how Brazil, Chile, China and Korea have financed infrastructure investment.
Case Studies
Brazil

13.
Long-term finance in Brazil relies substantially on the national development bank,
BNDES. High interest rates and a legacy of Brazil’s historically high inflation complicate
long-term borrowing despite a sophisticated financial system. Much long-term lending is
therefore done through BNDES, which is state-owned. BNDES, with some input from the
government, sets lending rates for a wide variety of infrastructure projects. The base rate for
these loans is well below even short-term market rates, and can be changed to direct lending.
As part of a current program to build up infrastructure before the 2014 World Cup and 2016
Summer Olympics, a decision was made to reduce lending spreads to various infrastructure
sectors in order to stimulate lending. However, concerns have been raised by many that the
dominance of a state-owned (and taxpayer-subsidized) lender in long-term financing has
distorted the financial sector and slowed the development of a more traditional long-term
debt market.
14.
While the energy sector is fragmented, state-run Elétrobras is the dominant
generator. Most electricity generation is hydroelectric, and Elétrobras is the largest operator
of hydro plants. It also dominates generation and transmission directly and through
subsidiaries, and has recently begun to invest abroad. The government holds 52 percent of

59
common shares, but Elétrobras is listed in Sao Paulo, New York, and Madrid, and issues debt
both domestically and internationally. Private investments by other companies have not been
as profitable as those of Elétrobras, though the government hopes the faster pace of economic
growth as well as the recent cuts to BNDES lending rates will change this in the future.
15.
The private sector has become more influential in financing highway construction
in recent years. Around 8 percent of national highways are now run by concessionaires on a
for-profit basis, though these are concentrated in the richest and most developed parts of the
country. In 2004 the government passed a law allowing joint public-private financing of
infrastructure investment, which despite some roadblocks, have also been successful,
particularly at the state level and with railroads. Concessionaires tend to be active issuers of
stock and some concessions have been attractive to foreign investors. Debt finance, however,
remains dominated by BNDES, with bank financing generally limited to short-term or trade
finance. Multilateral lending has also been an important source of long-term debt funding.
Chile

16.
Chile’s pro-business environment and successive waves of financial liberalization
have led to infrastructure investment dominated by the private sector. Chile’s influential
privatized pension system funneled workers’ savings into asset managers, leading to rapid
growth in its equity market (with a capitalization now at 144 percent of GDP), long-term
debt market, and insurance industry. Assets under management by the pension funds totaled
65 percent of GDP in 2009, while the insurance industry held an additional 22 percent. The
government’s transparency and openness have also made it a favored destination for foreign
investment.
17.
The energy sector is entirely privatized, with extensive foreign participation. Both
generation and transmission are effectively controlled by a small number of large companies.
During Chile’s period of rapid growth in the 1990s, the country’s pension funds were a
crucial source of funds for equity issuance, but in more recent years the increasing presence
of strategic foreign investors from Europe and North America has reduced most companies’
floats. These companies are also active issuers of debt in Chile’s corporate bond market.
With investment grade credit ratings, domestic issues are mostly purchased by insurance
companies and pension funds, but firms also issue in international markets.
18.
Roads construction and upgrading is largely done through PPPs. Beginning in the
1990s, when the country upgraded the main north-south highway, PPPs have become a
routine way for the government to build and upgrade major roads across the country. While
few PPPs have run into financial difficulties, the large size of the program led the
government to disclose the contingent liabilities of these programs in the budget, based on a
sophisticated analysis of possible cash flows. PPPs attract substantial FDI, both at the initial
phase and later on as construction companies have sold their contracts to outside investors.
But the main source of financing has been via debt, which Chilean companies have generally
wrapped by foreign monoline insurers policies to broaden the range of possible investors.

60
China

19.
The state-run financial system has been the primary source of finance for
infrastructure investment. Banks devote large shares of their loan portfolios (ranging from
18 up to 40 percent) to investments in infrastructure and one bank, the China Development
Bank, is focused largely (74 percent of assets) on investments in that area. Corporate bonds,
often with credit guarantees provided by banks or other entities, have become more
important in recent years. Local governments, which finance themselves via usage fees on
land (land premium) that rise as infrastructure improves, also guarantee much infrastructure
lending.
20.
Energy generation is dominated by five state-owned enterprises, but there are many
small private companies as well. Smaller companies are active in the equity market, but
large-scale investments by SOEs tend to be bank financed. In general, investment in energy
generation has not been profitable, as input costs, such as coal, have been liberalized more
than user rates. Government regulation and the difficulty of obtaining permits have also
complicated private investment in energy.
21.
A boom in roads has been catalyzed by local governments. With much of their
revenue coming from land premiums, local governments in China have tried to channel
funding into roads. Around one third of funding for road construction comes from local
governments directly, while another third comes from bank loans. Private SPVs have also
become quite large in some cases, with many issuing debt in local markets and 20 now listed
on equity exchanges.
Korea

22.
While Korea’s financial sector is large and sophisticated, infrastructure investment
remains largely a public-sector phenomenon. Infrastructure investment grew rapidly during
the country’s sustained boom from the 1960s to 1980s, but has tapered off in recent years. In
1994, a law was passed to facilitate private investment in infrastructure projects, but its
coverage was limited. Following an amendment in 1999, private involvement in
infrastructure rose to around 20 percent of the total.
23.
The Korean Electric Power Corporation (KEPCO) dominates the energy sector.
KEPCO was fully state-owned from 1981 to 1989, when 21 percent of shares were sold. The
company actively issues stock, but there are restrictions of the number of shares foreigners
can buy, as well as a legal requirement that the share of government ownership not fall below
51 percent. Such a large company has access to the full array of financing sources, and
KEPCO also actively issues investment-grade debt domestically and abroad.
24.
Until recently, highway construction was undertaken almost entirely by public
sector entities. The Korean highway network expanded rapidly during the 1960s, financed
almost entirely by a national highway corporation which borrowed money from banks and
multilateral lenders, as well as by issuing sovereign-backed bonds. Another boom occurred
during the 2000s, but with greater use of bond issuance, both domestic and international.

61
With the improved environment for private participation, around one quarter of the mileage
added during this period was built by private companies, some of which enjoyed support
from a public infrastructure fund.
Lessons for India

25.
Large infrastructure needs can be met domestically, though foreign participation
can be beneficial. Capacity increases such as India envisages for the remainder of the 11th
Plan and the 12th Plan have in many countries been accommodated within a country’s
domestic savings envelope, particularly for energy investments. But companies like KEPCO
and Elétrobras have used international debt issues to finance infrastructure investments
(Elétrobras also has foreign listings to raise equity finance abroad), and FDI has been an
important source of funding for roads and energy in Chile.
26.
Private funds can be catalyzed into infrastructure investment in a variety of ways.
With fiscal space relatively scarce, India will have to improve the environment for private
sector investment in infrastructure. Fiscal resources can be leveraged via guarantees, as local
governments in China do with bank loans for infrastructure projects, or via PPPs, as Chile
has done. China and Brazil also both use public financial enterprises to channel lending into
infrastructure projects, though this can create other problems. BNDES’ dominance of the
long-term lending market in Brazil worries many observers, and the concentration of lending
risk in infrastructure in China may raise financial risks.
27.
The business climate for private investment is also very important. In China, private
investment in energy has been slowed by government red tape and the varying pace of price
liberalization across different markets. In Korea, the PPP industry did not take off until the
government passed laws that broadened the scope of the original legislation. Chile has been
extremely successful at mobilizing private finance for infrastructure, but a World Economic
Forum report on its successes cited not only its open equity market, relatively well-developed
corporate bond sector and general economic stability but also its “extremely well-developed
e-government services, clear information on policy changes, transparency and openness of
statistics publications, and dialogue and decision-making process.”

India’s private saving has risen
sharply since the early 2000s. The increase
in India’s saving ratio is sizable when
compared against a large panel of emerging
and advanced economies. Private saving
increased from 24 percent of GDP in 2000 to
35 percent of GDP in 2009. This has
coincided with the rise in investment, and
more recently with the acceleration in
growth.

Since investment is forecast to continue to grow faster than GDP, understanding
2.
the determinants of private saving is key to assess the extent to which India will need to
tap foreign saving to finance investment.
India's Saving rates and Working population ratio
While the current account deficit has widened
in recent years, several factors point to a
continuation of rising private saving, at least
over the medium term. First, India’s saving
will continue to benefit from the increase in
the working-age dependency ratio. Growth in
1960
1970
1980
1990
2000
2010
income should help increase the overall
year
saving ratio as many households surpass their
subsistence level of consumption. The effects
of other factors can only be determined empirically. For instance, private saving may decline
as a result of fiscal consolidation, but this will depend on the extent to which Ricardian
equivalence holds. For example, in a country with low debt levels (and a low Ricardian
offset) a 1 percent of GDP decline in public saving is likely to lead to less than 1 percent of
GDP increase in private saving, which would contribute to an overall decline in national
saving. In the case of a highly indebted country, the increase in private saving may match the
decline in public saving, with no effect on national saving.

since the former yield mostly insignificant coefficients, likely because of the short time span
and persistence in the data. Despite considerable macroeconomic heterogeneity in such a
large panel of countries, the panel regression estimates are much more precise and robust.

The results are relatively robust and conform to life-cycle theories of
consumption and saving. The key findings include:
2

The data are from the IMF’s WEO and the World Bank’s WDI. The variable selection is based on traditional
theories of consumption.

64


Demographic variables exert significant influence on private saving. For example, a
1 percentage point decrease in young-age (old) dependency ratio increase private
saving by 0.2 (0.6) percentage points.



The effect of fiscal policies on private saving is also important, but the results do not
support Ricardian equivalence: a 1 percentage point decrease in public saving
increases private saving by about 0.5 percentage points. The effect is significantly
larger for countries with large public debt, meaning that for highly-indebted countries
an increase in the fiscal deficit is almost fully offset by a concomitant increase in
private saving.



Interest rates generally have a small effect on saving and, consistent with other
findings, the effect of financial development is generally ambiguous and statistically
insignificant.



Considerable macroeconomic heterogeneity is uncovered. For instance, the quantile
regression estimates show that the impact of public saving and demographic ratios on
private saving are larger for low-savers.

The empirical model indicates that the rise in private saving in India could
5.
continue for 5-10 years. According to these baseline projections, India’s saving rate could
increase by further 2-4 percentage points over the next 10 years as it would continue to
benefit from favorable demographics for two more decades. However, simple conditional
forecasts (assuming most regressors are constant at their end point value) point to a
moderation of the recent trend. The projection assumes constant growth in GDP per capita,
and an unchanged level of public saving. On balance, the envisaged fiscal consolidation
should help increase national saving, but according to the empirical model, the effect of
consolidation would be partly offset by private saving.

ANNEX I: INDIA—MEDIUM-TERM PUBLIC DEBT SUSTAINABILITY ANALYSIS
Macroeconomic Assumptions. India’s recovery from the economic crisis is well underway,
with growth forecast at 8 ¾ percent in 2010/11 led by infrastructure investment, but returning
to trend, 8 percent, in 2011/12. Inflation is relatively high, falling only to 6½ percent by end2010/11, and falling gradually to 4 percent thereafter.
Fiscal Assumptions. Consolidation is underway, with the budget deficit of the general
government expected to fall from 10½ percent of GDP in 2009/10 to 9½ of GDP in 2010/11,
falling gradually in the medium term. The main operating assumptions are:




Tax revenues will revive in 2010/11 as the economy returns to trend and will remain
strong in the medium term as more of the economy shifts into the formal sector.
The delayed Goods and Services Tax and new Direct Tax Code will be implemented
in 2012/13, contributing through efficiency gains to greater collections.
Spending growth will be strong in the near term, but over the course of the sample
period be kept slightly below nominal GDP growth, contributing around 1/3 of the
total fiscal consolidation during the sample period.
A. Sensitivity Analysis

Debt Path. General government debt would fall to 68 percent of GDP by 2015/16 from
77 percent of GDP in 2009/10. This downward trend is robust under most shocks. With little
debt denominated in foreign currency, India is not vulnerable to shifts in exchange rates, and
interest-rate sensitivity is also only a small risk given the long duration of its debt.
Other scenarios. A shock to growth in the near term would substantially slow consolidation
and keep debt at close to current levels in the medium term. A need to finance contingent
liabilities during the middle of the consolidation process would push debt above 2009/10
levels. In both cases, confidence could be damaged. The no policy change scenario presents a
worse trajectory, but by assuming that the primary balance remains the same, it effectively
assumes no recovery in revenues from crisis levels while this recovery is already underway.
Policy Risks. The authorities have ambitious consolidation goals. As described in the staff
report, restraining spending could be challenging. Contingent liabilities, such as those
stemming from PPPs, as well as the need to provide capital for public sector banks, could be
a risk. While there is potential for higher revenues and disinvestment proceeds, these are
more likely to be spent than to contribute to debt reduction.

Exchange Rate Arrangement:

As per the Annual Report on Exchange Arrangements and Exchange Restrictions (AREAER),
the exchange rate in India is classified as floating. The exchange rate of the rupee is determined
in the interbank market, where the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) intervenes at times. The RBI’s
role is to modulate excessive volatility so as to maintain orderly conditions. On August 20, 1994,
India accepted the obligations of Article VIII, Sections 2, 3, and 4 of the IMF Articles of
Agreement. India maintains the following restrictions on the making of payments and transfers
for current international transactions, which are subject to Fund approval under Article VIII,
Section 2(a): restrictions related to the nontransferability of balances under the India-Russia debt
agreement; restrictions arising from unsettled balances under inoperative bilateral payments
arrangements with two Eastern European countries; and a restriction on the transfer of
amortization payments on loans by non-resident relatives. The Executive Board has not approved
these restrictions.

ANNEX IV: INDIA—RELATIONS WITH THE WORLD BANK GROUP
In Bank FY2010 (July 1-June 30), IBRD/IDA lending totaled $9.31 billion, markedly above
the $2.24 billion in FY2009. IFC committed $1.8 billion in FY2010, up from $947 million in
FY2009. The World Bank Group’s (WBG) Country Strategy (CAS) for India for 2009-2012
focuses on helping India to fast-track the development of much-needed infrastructure and to
support the seven poorest states in achieving higher standards of living for their people. The
strategy envisaged a total proposed International Bank for Reconstruction and Development
(IBRD) lending program of US$14.6 billion for the four-year CAS period, of which
approximately $3 billion additional IBRD financing was projected for lending in response to
the financial crisis. The International Development Association (IDA) V allocation was
$4.79 billion (SDR equivalent of 2.919 billion).
As a result of the financial crisis as well as increased Government demand for the Bank
Group’s support, the pace of IBRD lending has been faster than initially expected, bringing
India closer to its Single Borrower Limit (SBL) of $17.5 billion earlier than anticipated. This
has resulted in a revised lending scenario that projects approximately US$8 billion in IBRD
lending in FY11 and FY12. To help maintain India’s IBRD net exposure within the SBL and
ensure medium term sustainability of the India program, the Government has agreed on
purchases of IBRD Special Private Placement Bonds. IFC is also carefully managing its
exposure in India via mobilization and selectivity, and is focusing on projects with strong
development additionality. IFC’s management agreed, on an exceptional basis, to allow India
to exceed the economic capital limit set for BRIC countries
The overarching objective of the CAS is to scale up the development impact of Bank Group
assistance to help India achieve rapid, inclusive growth and sustainable development, and
improving service delivery. It aims to do all this while strengthening weaknesses in project
implementation, improving the effectiveness of public spending, and achieving demonstrable
results to scale up the impact of World Bank assistance. The diversity of India calls for a
differentiated, tailored approach. In India’s low-income states and lagging regions in more
advanced states, the focus is on achieving the MDGs, relying primarily on IDA resources and
non-lending technical assistance (TA). In more advanced states and at the central level, the
focus is on strengthening institutions so that they can deal with emerging middle income
challenges, relying on IBRD lending and cutting-edge analytical work. IFC’s strategy
supports inclusive growth by increasing access to infrastructure and finance, focusing on
low-income, rural, and fragile regions and making climate change central to its work.
The India Program is increasingly focused on supporting large, transformative development
programs, such as the River Basin, Rural Roads II and National Livelihoods operations,
innovative pilots such as the Karnataka Watershed and the Social Security for the
Unorganized Sector Workers operations, and the leveraging of Bank resources. The shift to a
more substantial engagement has raised the visibility and influence of the Bank Group, while
creating opportunities for greater focus on public policy and institutional reform.

AsDB's India Country Partnership Strategy (2009-2012) (CPS) is based on four strategic
pillars: (i) Support for the process of inclusive and environmentally sustainable growth;
(ii) Catalyzing investment through the use of innovative business and financing modalities;
(iii) Strengthening the results orientation of project design and implementation and
emphasizing knowledge solutions; and (iv) Support for regional cooperation. The CPS has
been designed to support Government of India's efforts in facilitating inclusive growth and
speeding up the pace of poverty reduction and social development as emphasized in the
Eleventh Five-Year Plan (2007-2012). It has been prepared within a results-based
framework, and aims at significantly strengthening AsDB support for infrastructure
development in the relatively poorer states of India, promoting public private partnerships in
infrastructure, supporting climate change adaptation and mitigation, and encouraging the use
of innovative financing modalities (non-sovereign loans and cofinancing) to enhance the
leverage of AsDB operations.

12
ANNEX VI: INDIA––STATISTICAL ISSUES
1.
Macroeconomic statistics are adequate for surveillance, but weaknesses remain in the
timeliness and coverage of certain statistical series. India has an intricate system for compiling
economic and financial statistics and produces a vast quantity of data covering most sectors of the
economy. India subscribed to the Special Data Dissemination Standards (SDDS) on
December 27, 1996 and started posting its metadata on the Dissemination Standards Bulletin
Board on October 30, 1997. It is currently in observance of the SDDS, although it uses flexibility
options for timeliness of data on general government operations and on the periodicity and
timeliness of labor market data.
2.
The data module of the Report on Observance of Standards and Codes (ROSC, IMF
Country Report No. 04/96) was published in April 2004. It assesses India’s data dissemination
practices against the SDDS requirements and assesses the quality of six datasets based on the Data
Quality Assessment Framework (DQAF) developed by STA.
3.
National accounts and employment statistics: The Central Statistical Organization
(CSO) releases a new series of national accounts, with base year 2004–2005 with a dissemination
lag for quarterly releases of two months. Estimates of value added in constant prices for public
administration and defense may be biased upwards, as they are based on the government’s wage
bill (with arrears counted in the year that they are paid) deflated by the Wholesale Price Index
(WPI). There are long standing deficiencies in employment data: they are only available on an
annual basis and with a substantial lag, and they only cover the formal sector, which accounts for a
small segment of the labor market.
4.
Price statistics: Since January 2006, the Labour Bureau has published a CPI for industrial
workers with a 2001 base year. A revised CPI with new weights is expected to be unveiled in early
2011. Presently, there are four CPIs, each based on the consumption basket of a narrow category of
consumers (namely industrial workers, urban and nonmanual employees, agricultural laborers, and
rural laborers). The CPIs are published with a lag of about one month. With the exception of the
industrial workers CPI, the other indices are based on weights that are over ten years. The WPI
was also recently revised and has a 2004/05 base year. The primary articles components of the
WPI are published weekly with a lag of two weeks. Despite recent progress, real estate and
housing price data are not available on a timely basis and the geographic coverage remains limited.
5.
External sector statistics: While the concepts and definitions used to compile balance of
payments statistics are broadly in line with the fifth edition of the Balance of Payments Manual
(BPM5), the RBI presentation does not strictly follow the BPM5. Furthermore, trade data have
quality, valuation, timing, and coverage problems, and data on trade prices, volumes, and
composition are not regularly available on a timely basis. Only trade credit extended for more than
180 days is included in the balance of payments (and the IIP and external debt data); trade credit is
often less than 180 days in most countries. Bilateral data on services exports to the United States
and other developed countries are manifold higher than counterpart services imports published by
these same countries. External debt statistics are available on a quarterly basis with a one quarter
lag. Estimates of short-term external debt are presented in the debt statistics on an original maturity

13
basis. The short-term maturity attribution on a residual maturity basis is only available annually
(and excludes residual maturity of medium- and long-term nonresident Indian accounts). The
international investment position (IIP) statistics cover the sectors prescribed in the BPM5 and these
data are disseminated within six months of the reference period in respect of annual data. Coverage
of direct investment positions data is hampered by the absence of appropriate legal or institutional
authority. India began disseminating the Data Template on International Reserves and Foreign
Currency Liquidity as prescribed under the SDDS in December 2001. The more up-to-date
information on certain variables, such as total foreign reserves, foreign currency assets, gold, and
SDRs, are available on a weekly basis and are disseminated as part of a weekly statistical
supplement on the RBI web site.
6.
Monetary and financial statistics: The RBI web site and the RBI Bulletin publish a wide
array of monetary and financial statistics, including reserve money and its components, RBI’s
survey, monetary survey, liquidity aggregates (outstanding amounts), interest rates, exchange rates,
foreign reserves, and results of government securities auctions. The frequency and quality of data
dissemination have improved substantially in recent years.
7.
Concepts and definitions used by the RBI to compile monetary statistics are in broad
conformity with the guidelines provided in the Monetary and Financial Statistics Manual
(MFSM). Nevertheless, the following concepts and principles deviate from the MFSM. First, the
resident sector data do not provide sufficient information on the sectoral distribution of domestic
credit. Specifically, under their present sectorization scheme, the authorities subdivide the resident
nonbank sector data by (i) central government; (ii) state government; and (iii) the commercial
sector (including other financial corporations, public and other nonfinancial corporations, and
other resident sectors). Second, commercial banks add accrued interest to credit and deposit
positions on a quarterly basis only (instead of the prescribed monthly basis).
8.
The RBI reports monetary data for IFS on a regular basis. Since October 2006, the RBI has
initiated the electronic reporting of monetary data, which is a major improvement from the
previous paper-based reporting which was prone to errors and delays. India has also submitted to
STA test data (starting from December 2001 data) on the Standardized Report Forms (SRFs) that
have been developed to implement the methodology outlined in the MFSM. STA is working with
the authorities in resolving the outstanding data issues on the development of the SRFs.
9.
Fiscal operations: The Ministry of Finance (MoF) posts selected central government
monthly fiscal data and quarterly debt data on its web site. However, no monthly data on fiscal
performance at the state level are available, and annual data are available only with an 8-month to
10-month lag. Consolidated information is unavailable on local government operations. In
addition, data on the functional and economic classification of expenditures are available with
considerable lag. There is also scope to improve the analytical usefulness of the presentation of the
fiscal accounts. For example, classification of government expenditure between
developmental/nondevelopmental and plan/nonplan obscures the economic nature and impact of
fiscal actions. The MoF reports central government data (on a cash basis) for publication in the
Government Finance Statistics Yearbook (latest reported data correspond to 2006).

Washington, D. C. 20431 USA

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2010 Article IV Consultation
with India
On December 22, 2010, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF)
concluded the Article IV consultation with India.1
Background
India’s growth is among the highest in the world. Since mid-2009 the pace of India’s recovery—
led by domestic demand, especially infrastructure investment—has been strong. Monetary and
fiscal policies remain accommodative: real interest rates are low and although there has been
some fiscal consolidation, the fiscal deficit remains high. With little slack in the economy, the
ongoing exit from the policy stimulus introduced during the crisis, and structural factors affecting
food prices, inflation measures are in the 8½ to 10½ percent range. Financial conditions are
comfortable, and capital inflows have been strong.
India’s economy is projected to grow by 8¾ percent in real terms in 2010/11, moderating to
about 8 percent the following year. Following last year’s drought, this year’s growth is already
benefiting from the rebound in agriculture and the pickup in private consumption as employment
prospects have improved and disposable incomes continue to rise. Infrastructure is expected to
remain an important growth driver and corporate investment is likely to accelerate, aided by
conducive financing conditions and robust demand growth. India’s medium-term growth
prospects remain strong. The economy is expected to continue to expand rapidly, supported by
high investment and productivity gains.

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On
return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the
Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the
Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the
country's authorities. An explanation of any qualifiers used in summings up can be found here:

Risks to growth are broadly balanced, with downside risks relating mainly to the global
economy. Surging capital inflows could further spur investment, but could complicate
macroeconomic management. Sustaining rapid growth over the medium term will depend on
sustaining reforms to facilitate infrastructure investment—such as deepening the corporate
bond market and lowering the cost of doing business—and improving social indicators while
carrying out fiscal consolidation. Improving social outcomes and infrastructure are two key
pillars of the government’s strategy to achieve rapid and inclusive growth.
Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors commended the authorities for their economic stewardship which has
helped India weather the crisis well. Growth is among the fastest growing in the world, social
indicators are improving, and medium-term economic prospects are favorable. Risks stem
mainly from weaker global growth. Near-term challenges confronting the authorities arise from
elevated inflation, fiscal consolidation needs, and buoyant capital inflows, warranting careful
calibration of macroeconomic policies and the diligent pursuit of ongoing reforms.
Directors commended the Reserve Bank of India’s (RBI) efforts to tighten monetary conditions.
Noting that short-term real interest rates remain below historic norms and financing conditions
have hardened only marginally, most Directors recommended further steps to bring the real
repo rate clearly into positive territory. They welcomed the RBI’s moves to increase the
frequency of policy reviews and publish more guidance on future actions. Most Directors
considered that continuing to improve the CPI, including a new national CPI to be introduced in
the future, and utilizing information from it in policymaking could increase the impact of
monetary policy on inflation expectations. Directors also highlighted the role of structural
reforms in containing food price inflation.
Directors welcomed the authorities’ commitment to fiscal consolidation, including their plans to
streamline spending. The envisaged Goods and Services Tax and the new Direct Tax Code
should increase tax efficiency. Given buoyant economic growth, and since future deficit targets
could be more difficult to reach, most Directors saw merit in a further strengthening of the
consolidation effort. Saving this year’s over performance in revenue and one-off receipts could
help reconstitute fiscal space. More substantial current spending adjustment, mainly by further
cutting subsidies and improving the targeting of spending, would help achieve social goals
along with medium-term fiscal consolidation. A few Directors favored an appropriate balance
between pacing the consolidation and sustaining growth by addressing the exigencies of
infrastructure investment and social spending.
Directors observed that low yields in advanced economies and India’s favorable growth
differentials could raise capital inflows above its absorptive capacity. While exchange rate
flexibility would remain the first line of defense, reserve accumulation and macroprudential
measures could be employed if strong inflows continue. Absorptive capacity could also be
improved by deepening financial markets or by liberalizing foreign direct investment (FDI),
consistent with India’s gradual approach to capital account liberalization.

3

Directors supported the authorities’ focus on strengthening financial stability, including efforts to
strengthen macroprudential regulations to cool the residential real estate market and to ensure
a regulatory level playing field across the financial industry. While India’s banking system is
resilient and well capitalized, Directors noted that monitoring asset quality will remain important,
particularly as prudential norms for infrastructure are eased. They commended the introduction
of the RBI’s Financial Stability Report, the announced review of financial laws, and the creation
of the Financial Stability and Development Council, and looked forward to the forthcoming
Financial Sector Assessment Program.
Directors welcomed the emphasis on investment in infrastructure and human capital.
They supported the measures taken to increase the availability of long-term finance for
infrastructure, especially moves to develop the corporate bond market, while noting that in the
short run foreign savings also would be needed. Directors supported the authorities’ reform
efforts in areas such as land acquisition and government clearances, while also stressing the
importance of strong accountability and transparency over large infrastructure projects.

Statement by Arvind Virmani, Executive Director for India
and Michael Patra, Advisor
December 22, 2010
1.
Our authorities convey their appreciation for the constructive engagement with the
Article IV Mission during the mid-year review and in the annual Consultations. They found
the discussions on various aspects of the Indian economy and the evolving outlook useful and
open-minded. The broad thrust of staff’s policy advice in several areas is consistent with our
views. Issues on which there are differences in views are set out in the staff report, attesting
to the frankness and candour that marked the discussions. In this statement, we dwell on
these specific areas with a view to explaining the rationale underlying our authorities’
positions.
Macroeconomic Outlook
2.
Potential growth/underlying trend growth of the economy by our calculations is 8.5 to
9.0 percent.1 Any upside potential depends on the global recovery and faster domestic policy
and institutional reform. Staff’s analysis of India’s growth based on mean reversion to 8.0
percent is less than convincing. Recovery to high growth has been somewhat faster than
expected in 2009-10 and in the first half of 2010-11. Lead indicators point to even stronger
growth in the second half of 2010-11 with the full year projection at 8.75 percent (+/- 0.35
percent).
Inflation and Monetary Policy
3.
Inflation in terms of both wholesale prices and consumer prices has been declining in
recent months. Inflation is expected by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) to come down
further to 5.5 percent by March 2011, but food price inflation remains relatively high and
may influence inflation expectations. Monetary policy has to take account of these factors in
addition to aggregate demand pressures. On the basis of the March 2011 inflation projection
serving as a measure of inflation expectations, the policy rate – currently at 6.25 percent – is
positive in real terms and set to rise further with inflation receding as policy transmission
becomes more completely reflected in lending rates. In this context, it is important to
remember that estimates of the Taylor rule vary considerably and application depends on
estimates/assumptions of potential growth and the inflation threshold.2
Fiscal Policy
4.
Since the enactment of the Fiscal Responsibility and Budget Management (FRBM)
Bill in 2004, our authorities have been committed to reducing the fiscal deficit. The fiscal
outcome for 2007-08 before the global crisis was ahead of target. The Central Government’s
fiscal deficit was down to 2.6 percent of GDP and the State Governments’ fiscal deficit to 1.5
percent of GDP.

5.
When the global crisis struck in 2008-09, a conscious decision was made to offset the
reduction in net exports, and private investment and consumption by a fiscal expansion of 3.3
percent of GDP in 2008-09 and of 3.9 percent of GDP in 2009-10, which helped limit the
contraction to real GDP growth of 6.7 percent in 2008-09 and 7.5 percent in 2009-10. The
2009-10 Central Government’s budget laid out a path for returning to the time line of FRBM
targets. We will meet the fiscal deficit target of 5.5 percent in 2010-11 and the targets for the
next two years. Guided by the recommendations of the thirteenth Finance Commission, the
States’ combined fiscal deficit is also set on a path that will take it down to 3 percent of GDP
within the next four years. A third important target is to reduce the debt/GDP ratio of the
general Government from the current level of 73 percent to 65 percent by 2014-15. The
process of fiscal consolidation envisages a balanced mix of expenditure reduction and
revenue growth.
6.
Available information indicates that fiscal consolidation is proceeding as planned.
Over the first seven months of the fiscal year 2010-11, i.e., April-October 2010, the fiscal
deficit is only 42.6 percent of the budget estimates for the full year while the revenue deficit
is only 34.3 percent. Underlying this healthy development is the buoyant growth of 26
percent in net tax revenues. While non-tax revenues have risen by 119 percent on account of
3G and broadband wireless spectrum auctions, these receipts would hold up at their levels in
the corresponding period of last year, even if these one-time receipts were excluded.
Importantly, there is a significant deceleration in the growth of non-plan revenue
expenditure. A simple calculation shows that even excluding these items, fiscal consolidation
is following its charted course and given these indications, deficit targets set for the year will
be met.
7.
Consolidation is one of the most important components of fiscal policy in India. The
estimated reduction in the fiscal deficit in 2010-11 is based on a set of fiscal measures that
have been undertaken and is consistent with the announced path of consolidation. A further
drastic reduction in public expenditure and the fiscal deficit may be counterproductive, and
may have a negative impact on the economy and on the recovery. Our authorities are also of
the view that any windfall gains during the course of the year should not be utilised for fiscal
consolidation alone but also for much needed physical and social infrastructure requirements.
External Sector
8.
Given weak global growth contrasted with relatively high growth in India and
associated demand for imports, a widening in the current account deficit (CAD) is not
unexpected. This increase in the CAD has also made an important contribution to global net
demand. However, a rise of the CAD above 3 percent would increase the risks arising from
volatility of capital flows. In this context, the policy of building reserves over the last few
years has been vindicated and can be recommended to other countries with CADs financed
by capital flows.
9.
Our position is that capital account liberalization is not a stand-alone objective but a
means for higher and stable growth. We believe our economy should move towards greater
capital account liberalization along a gradual path - the path itself being recalibrated on a
dynamic basis in response to domestic and global developments. No policy instrument is

3
clearly off the table and our choice of instruments will be determined by the context.
Historically, we have used policy levers on the debt side of the flows to manage volatility.
Contrary to popular perception, we have used both quantity and price based variables to
moderate debt flows. As regards exchange rate policy, we are not guided by a fixed or preannounced target or band. Our policy has been to intervene in the market to manage
excessive volatility and disruptions to the macroeconomic situation. Two way movements
are a clear demarcation of our flexible exchange rate policy.
Infrastructure
10.
In order to meet the requirements of sustainable and inclusive growth, investment in
physical infrastructure needs to go up from 5 per cent of GDP (2002-07) to about 9 per cent
(2007-12). By current assessment, the level of investment in infrastructure has risen to about
7.1 percent of GDP. This investment is being driven significantly by public-private
partnerships, with the level of private involvement of around 30 percent. The development of
the corporate bond markets should facilitate a further increase in infrastructure investment by
the private sector. Accelerating the pace of infrastructure development remains the highest
priority.
Conclusion
11.
India’s domestic demand-led economy is rising back to its high growth trend.
Inflation is easing but will warrant continuous monitoring. Growth differentials vis-à-vis the
global economy are being reflected in an expansion in the current account deficit. So far,
surges in capital flows have been absorbed into financing a higher level of net imports. Given
the volatility of cross-border capital flows, macroeconomic management will have to ensure
that risks are minimized.
