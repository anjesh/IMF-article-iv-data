IMF Executive Board Concludes the 2016 Article IV Consultation and the Fifth PostProgram Monitoring Discussion with Ireland
On July 27, 2016, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded
the Article IV consultation1 and the Fifth Post-Program Monitoring Discussion with Ireland.
The rebound of the Irish economy has been exceptional. According to the previous data
release in March 2016, Ireland’s real GDP was reported to have grown by 7.8 percent in
2015 on the back of strong domestic demand and solid export growth. Subsequent revisions
to the national accounts in July 2016 have led to an upgrade of the 2015 GDP growth to
26.3 percent, mainly due to much larger net exports contributions, while private consumption
growth was modified much more moderately from 3.5 to 4.5 percent. The GDP revisions,
which represent a level shift, are largely related to relocation of multinational companies to
Ireland, which had a limited impact on the underlying Irish economy, as explained in the
Supplementary Information to the Staff Report.
High frequency indicators suggest that growth momentum has continued in 2016. Solid job
creation has reduced the unemployment rate below 8 percent. Inflation has hovered around
zero as low commodity and food prices more than offset rising cost of services, particularly
housing rents. Owing to buoyant revenues, the general government deficit narrowed to
2.3 percent of GDP (pre-revision national accounts) in 2015, thus allowing Ireland to exit the
Excessive Deficit Procedure. The deficit is projected to fall below one percent this year,
despite some spending overruns, mainly in the health sector.
The positive economic performance is expected to continue, but the UK vote to leave the EU
amplifies downward risks. Over the medium term, Ireland’s economy is likely to be affected
by the spillovers. The severity of the impact is, however, difficult to gauge at this stage, and
will crucially depend on the future relationship between the UK and the EU, especially
regarding trade, financial flows, and movement of labor.

1

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with members,
usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial information, and discusses
with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a
report, which forms the basis for discussion by the Executive Board.

2

Taking into account negative spillovers, real GDP growth is projected to decline to just
below 5 percent in 2016 and converge to its estimated potential (about 3 percent a year) over
the medium-term on the back of more moderate export growth and investment activity. As a
result, the output gap is expected to virtually close and the current account surplus to
moderate by the end of the forecasting period. Against this backdrop, staff estimate that the
government’s objective of reaching the medium-term objective of a structural deficit of
½ percent of GDP remains broadly within reach.
Since the crisis, Ireland’s financial regulatory and supervisory frameworks have been
significantly upgraded and the financial soundness of the banking sector has improved, yet
challenges from crisis legacies persist. This progress was evaluated by the IMF’s Financial
Sector Assessment Program, the findings of which are summarized in the accompanying
Financial System Stability Assessment.
Executive Board Assessment2
Executive Directors welcomed Ireland’s remarkable economic rebound, improving public
finances, and positive outlook. At the same time, they noted that the recovery is incomplete
and crisis legacies persist in an environment of increased uncertainty, including following the
U.K. vote to leave the EU. They urged the authorities to continue to strengthen the
foundations for sustainable and inclusive long-term growth. They recommended locking in
recent gains, tackling lingering crisis legacies, rebuilding policy buffers, and bolstering the
economy’s resilience through structural reform.
Directors commended the authorities’ solid track record of fiscal prudence, which has
allowed Ireland to exit the EU’s Excessive Deficit Procedure. They supported continued
public debt reduction to lessen the Irish economy’s vulnerability to shocks and rebuild room
for countercyclical fiscal policy. They noted that the authorities’ plan to create a “rainy day”
fund over the medium term could be an important buffer in case of need. Directors agreed
that fiscal policy could better support job-rich growth by rebalancing the tax mix away from
direct taxes; widening the tax base and reducing the burden on middle-income households;
increasing spending efficiency, particularly in health; and better targeting social transfers to
improve intergenerational fairness. Directors noted that higher and prioritized capital
expenditure would help buttress Ireland’s competitiveness.
Directors welcomed the improvement in banks’ financial soundness. They stressed, however,
that persistent banking vulnerabilities, together with potential adverse spillovers from the
U.K. vote, point to the importance of continued supervisory vigilance and careful risk

At the conclusion of the discussion, the Deputy Managing Director, as Chairman of the Board, summarizes the
views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the country’s authorities. An explanation of

management. While there has been significant progress in reducing nonperforming loans,
Directors underscored the need for continued efforts, and supported the authorities’ plans in
this area, including providing access to financial and legal advice to distressed mortgage
borrowers.
Directors supported the authorities’ intention to maintain macroprudential measures on
mortgage lending, and the central bank’s plan to periodically assess the effectiveness of these
measures. They underscored the importance of policies to alleviate housing supply shortage,
and encouraged monitoring of the commercial real estate market and the asset management
sector.
Directors highlighted the importance of policies to support a robust and inclusive mediumterm growth and job creation. Priorities could include broadening financing options for small
and medium enterprises, supporting innovation, enhancing labor activation policies and
technical and vocational programs to reduce skills mismatches, and strengthening female
labor force participation.
Noting the recent revision of Ireland’s national accounts, Directors supported the authorities’
work underway to develop additional metrics that better reflect Ireland’s underlying
economic activity.

STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2016 ARTICLE IV
CONSULTATION AND FIFTH POST-PROGRAM
MONITORING DISCUSSIONS—SUPPLEMENTARY
INFORMATION
Prepared by

The European Department

The purpose of this supplement is to inform the Board about the recent revisions of
Ireland’s national accounts and the latest economic developments. The GDP growth for
2014-15 was significantly revised upwards largely due to operations of multinational
companies. As this reflects a level shift and the underlying economic developments appear
unchanged, these revisions do not alter the thrust of the staff appraisal. Nonetheless,
additional metrics better reflecting the underlying developments of the Irish economy
should be developed to support policymaking and communications to the public.
1.
On July 12, Ireland’s Central Statistics Office (CSO) released the new
national accounts for 2015 and prior years. The annual benchmarking exercise of
national income and expenditure resulted in a large upward level shift of nominal and
real GDP, largely on the back of higher net exports (Table). The already impressive
growth rate in 2015 was upgraded from 7.8 percent to 26.3 percent,1 and the real GNP
growth rate from 5.7 percent to 18.7 percent. Reflecting the large revision of net exports,
the trade and current account surpluses were revised upward from 30.1 percent of GDP
to 43.2 percent of GDP and from 4.4 percent of GDP to 10.2 percent of GDP,
respectively. The recording of new large direct and portfolio investment led to a marked
deterioration of Ireland’s negative net international investment position (NIIP) from
69.6 percent of GDP to 207.7 percent of GDP. In addition, the upward revision of
nominal GDP mechanically improved the fiscal metrics, with the general government
budget deficit narrowing from 2.3 percent of GDP to 1.9 percent of GDP and gross debt
declining from 93.8 percent of GDP to 78.7 percent of GDP in staff’s calculations.

1

The growth rate in 2014 was also lifted up from 5.2 percent to 8.5 percent.

IRELAND

2.
These revisions, which are in line with ESA2010 and BPM6 methodology, are explained
by a number of factors, largely related to operations of multinational companies. Corporate
restructuring through the relocation to Ireland of companies’ entire balance sheets, the shifting of
assets to Irish subsidiaries, and the takeover of foreign companies by Irish entities, have led to a
dramatic increase in the level of capital assets in Ireland. The mirror image of this has been a
substantial negative revision of Ireland’s NIIP due to higher liabilities to nonresidents. The relocation
of companies has also been associated with an increase in “contract manufacturing”, which boosts
Ireland’s exports and GDP.2 The significant upward adjustment of net exports has more than offset
the now more-negative net factor income from abroad, thereby leading to an upward revision of
Ireland’s GNP as well. The increase in the number of new aircraft imports into Ireland for
international leasing activities is an additional factor driving the revision of national accounts and
balance of payments statistics.
3.
Although these revisions make the assessment of the Irish economy more complex, a
number of indicators confirms its strong underlying rebound. For example, private consumption
and retail sales grew strongly in 2015 (4.5 percent and 8.2 percent, respectively) on the back of rising
employment (2.6 percent). Public finances have continued to improve and government’s debt-toGDP ratio has declined rapidly, irrespective of the recent revision of the nominal GDP. However,
owing to the open and globalized nature of the Irish economy, the revised headline metrics, such as
GDP and GNP, are somewhat delinked from the underlying economic developments. A thorough
analysis of the revised data would require more detailed information on the activity of the
multinational corporations, which is unavailable for confidentiality reasons.
4.
Staff and the authorities agree that the underlying economic developments, which
formed the basis of the Article IV consultation discussions, remain valid, despite the revision
of the national accounts. If staff were to include the revised national accounts figures into the
macroeconomic framework, it would distort the true representation of underlying economic
developments and the headline ratios to GDP. This could lead to incorrect analysis and policy
conclusions. For example, while this would mechanically reduce the debt-to-GDP ratio, it would not
represent a true improvement in Ireland’s ability to service debt or the capacity to repay the Fund.
Consequently, these statistical revisions do not alter staff’s analysis and policy
recommendations.
5.
Staff now recommend that the authorities develop additional metrics that better
reflect Ireland’s underlying economic activity, to support policymaking and communications
to the public, but this process will likely require some time. Staff, therefore, welcome the CSO’s
initiative to convene a high-level cross-sector consultative group to examine how best to provide

“Contract manufacturing” refers to a special form of outsourcing, where an Irish company engages a company
abroad to manufacture products on its behalf but retains the economic ownership of the inputs used in this
production process. When the product is sold to a customer abroad, a change in economic ownership takes place
and the export of this good is then recorded in the Irish national accounts and balance of payments, even though it
was never produced in Ireland.

insight and understanding of all aspects of the Irish economy, including the potential to develop
additional indicators.
6.
The authorities noted that they will prepare full macroeconomic projections in
advance of Budget 2017 in October. This will include updated forecasts of economic growth,
public finances, and fiscal space, taking account of developments up to that time, including the
latest CSO numbers, and the UK decision to leave the EU. The authorities have indicated that the
26.3 percent GDP growth in 2015 will not affect policymaking, and have outlined that policies will be
based on more moderate growth rates. Specifically, in relation to fiscal policy, the revenue
projections for 2017 will be based on the estimated tax revenue outturn for 2016, and the projected
nominal GDP growth rate for 2017 of about 5 percent.
7.
The thrust of the staff appraisal remains unchanged, with the exception of the
recommendation above to develop additional metrics that better reflect the underlying
economic activity, to support policymaking and communications to the public.

Update of recent developments
8.
Several recent data releases by the CSO confirm that the Irish economy is recovering at
a solid pace. These indicators do not change the outlook for 2016 at this stage.


Output. On the basis of the new national accounts, output in Q1 2016 was 2.3 percent higher
than a year ago. While investment and net exports declined, personal consumption rose by
5 percent. This reflects the continued mending of the labor market (the unemployment rate
declined to 7.8 percent in June), earnings growth, and high level of consumer confidence.



Inflation. Headline inflation came in at 0.1 percent year-on year in June 2016, mostly reflecting
still weak commodity and fuel prices. Core inflation remained at around 1 percent.



Public finances. In Q1 2016, the general government deficit was reported at €1,471 million, well
below that recorded a year ago (€2,331 million). This was mainly due to strong tax revenues,
while government expenditure experienced a small decline, due to lower net capital investment.
This performance bodes well for achieving the annual deficit target. The general government
gross debt marginally rose to €206.8 billion from €201.3 billion in Q4 2015, reflecting a net
increase in the issuance of debt securities in the period considered.



External sector. The current account balance recorded a surplus of €8,955 million in Q1 2016
compared to €4,519 million in Q1 2015 reflecting mainly lower investment income payable to
foreign investors, lower merchandise imports, and higher computer service exports. Total gross
external debt declined to €2,169 million in Q1 2016 from €2,227 million in Q4 2015.

STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2016 ARTICLE IV
CONSULTATION AND FIFTH POST-PROGRAM
MONITORING DISCUSSIONS

KEY ISSUES
Ireland’s growth has been exceptional, but the recovery is incomplete, and is now
subject to appreciable downside risks. GDP growth reached 7.8 percent in 2015,
supported by robust domestic demand and exports, and unemployment is receding. Yet the
recovery remains to be completed, with employment and consumption below their pre-crisis
levels. Vulnerabilities are still elevated due to high public and private debts, and a large
stock of nonperforming loans (NPLs). The economic outlook continues to appear broadly
positive, but the heightened uncertainty resulting from the UK vote to leave the EU and the
ensuing negative spillovers are a cause for concern. More than many other EU economies,
Ireland’s medium-to long-term outlook will be affected by the nature of the future
relationship between the UK and the EU, especially regarding trade, financial flows, and
labor movement.
Policy priorities include tackling the remaining crisis legacies, buttressing foundations
for sustainable and inclusive long-term growth, and monitoring and mitigating the
fall-out of the UK vote to leave the EU.


Attain sustainable public finances and continue public debt reduction. Improve
spending efficiency and rebalance the tax mix to boost employment and growth.



Improve private sector’s balance sheets. Household debt remains high and corporate
sector vulnerabilities are also elevated, particularly among domestic SMEs. Recovery in
the banking system is progressing, and, as noted in the Financial System Stability
Assessment, continued intensified efforts are needed to further reduce NPLs and boost
the private sector’s resilience and ability to support durable growth.



Mitigate boom-bust cycles. Maintain macroprudential limits on mortgages as a
permanent feature of the mortgage market and periodically assess their impact and
effectiveness. Monitor commercial real estate markets and stand ready to activate policy
tools if risks to financial stability emerge. Help boost housing supply.



Address structural weaknesses to support robust and inclusive medium-term
growth and job creation. Broaden the options for SME financing and promote
innovation. Strengthen incentives for female labor force participation, enhance labor
activation policies, and expand technical and vocational training.



In the meantime, closely monitor and mitigate spillovers from the UK vote to leave
the EU. Policymakers will need to monitor closely the response of the economy and the
financial system and stand ready to take remedial actions—such as a countercyclical
fiscal policy together with central banks’ commitment to backstop liquidity in euros and
other currencies—if and when needed.

CONTEXT
1.
Ireland’s economy has rebounded exceptionally, but the recovery is incomplete and
crisis legacies still pose challenges. Ireland’s growth outperformed that of its peers during 201415, bringing real GDP at end-2015 ten percent above its pre-crisis level. The robust economic
growth was supported by favorable external conditions, and was accompanied by improved balance
sheets, a strengthening banking sector, steady job creation, and rising incomes and asset prices.
Policy implementation has been strong (Annex I). Nevertheless, the recovery is unfinished and has
yet to benefit parts of the population. Moreover, elevated public and private sector debts and a
large stock of banks’ distressed loans leave the economy susceptible to shocks.

The newly-elected government needs to maintain the economic policy course and
tackle crisis legacies to achieve durable and inclusive long-term growth. The minority coalition
that was formed in May 2016 following the February general election consists of the former
incumbent party, Fine Gael, and independents. The importance of preserving economic recovery and
safeguarding public finances is widely shared, and the broad policy course is likely to be continued.
Nevertheless, the increased political fragmentation and reform fatigue may complicate policymaking
and the fallout from the UK vote to leave the EU could do so too.

EXCEPTIONAL GROWTH BUT ELEVATED
VULNERABILITIES
A remarkable growth performance is supported by favorable external conditions
3.
The Irish economy has performed beyond expectations (Figure 1). Real GDP posted
7.8 percent growth in 2015 on the back of strong domestic demand and solid export growth. Gross
fixed capital formation was mainly driven by investment in intellectual property by multinationals
(MNEs) (Box 1), and a rise in machinery and construction investment.1 Private consumption
1 Multinationals account for 57 percent of the business sector’s gross value added and 20 percent of employment.
Financial linkages with domestic banks are limited.

expanded strongly as consumer sentiment surged, the drag from deleveraging moderated, wages
and employment improved, and low inflation supported real incomes. Double-digit export growth
benefited from favorable external conditions: a real effective depreciation of the euro reflecting
continued monetary easing by the ECB and strong trading-partner demand. Yet the contribution of
net exports to growth was only marginal as imports rebounded together with exports and
investment.2 The recovery has been broad based, though the information and communications
technology (ICT) and manufacturing (including pharmaceuticals) sectors have been particularly
buoyant. High-frequency indicators suggest that the growth momentum has continued in 2016.

Box 1. Onshoring of Intangible Assets to Ireland
Partly in response to increasing multilateral efforts to combat aggressive tax planning and avoidance, including
the OECD’s Base Erosion and Profit Shifting (BEPS) Action Plan, some MNEs have chosen to restructure their
businesses and relocate their intangible assets, such as patents and copyrights, to countries with supportive
business environment.
Consequently, Ireland, which maintains a competitive taxation environment, including for intellectual propertyrelated activities (Knowledge Box), experienced a sharp increase in intangibles investment to 9½ percent of
GDP in 2015 from about 5 percent of GDP in 2014. To the extent that investment in intangibles is related to
patent onshoring, it is matched by imports, and thus is GDP neutral during the year of the transaction.
Nevertheless, this investment adds to Ireland’s capital stock, and in the future, ceteris paribus, will contribute
positively to net export growth (mainly due to lower royalty payments abroad).

Labor markets continued to improve without inflationary pressures. The solid
employment growth in 2015 helped reduce the unemployment rate to 7.8 percent in May 2016, and
was reflected in a moderate increase in private sector’s real wages, though labor force participation
has not recovered so far. Inflation hovered around zero owing to lower commodity and food prices,
which more than offset the rising cost of services, particularly housing rents.

Public finances delivered a sizeable outperformance in 2015. Revenues significantly
exceeded the initial budget profile, largely reflecting strong corporate income tax (CIT) receipts.3
Expenditures rose more moderately over the budget profile (but slightly below the supplementary
budget envelope), as a lower-than-planned interest bill partly offset higher current primary
spending. The general

Residential real estate (RRE) prices and rents
continued to increase. Nevertheless, following
the abolishment of tax exemptions on capital
gains in December 2014 and the introduction of
new macroprudential loan-to-value (LTV) and
loan-to-income (LTI) limits in February 2015 (see
2015 Article IV Staff Report), the market
somewhat cooled off: RRE price growth
decelerated in late 2015 and the number of
mortgage approvals temporarily declined
(Figure 3).

Financial conditions have been broadly supportive. As elsewhere, the UK vote to leave
the EU has led to stock market losses but the sovereign bond market has been well behaved. The
ECB’s quantitative easing (QE), together with Ireland’s favorable growth prospects, have kept the 10year Irish sovereign yields very low, even if the spreads slightly widened temporarily following the
UK vote to leave the EU. In line with other European countries, the Irish equity market partly
reversed its last year’s gains and declined by about 17 percent in 2016H1. Reflecting the strong GDP
growth, improved balance sheets and prudent fiscal policy, Moody’s upgraded Ireland’s sovereign
rating to A3 (May 2016), following Fitch’s and S&P’s upgrades to A (February 2016) and A+
(June 2015), respectively. The recent issuance of a 100-year sovereign bond is an additional sign of
market confidence.

Yet the recovery is still incomplete

Domestic demand and employment have yet to return to their pre-crisis levels. Private
consumption, albeit recovering, is held back by the ongoing deleveraging process and the
prevalence of households with low or negative equity. Disposable income is still some 5 percent
below its peak, partly due to the higher tax burden. Investment in residential properties is lagging

High public and private debt burdens
leave the economy vulnerable to shocks. Public
debt has declined to about 94 percent of GDP at
end-2015 from a peak of 120 percent of GDP in
2013, but remains well above the pre-crisis levels.
Despite falling debt, many households are
susceptible to a drop in income or an interest rate
increase. Nonfinancial corporates’ (NFC) profitability
has improved significantly and deleveraging has
continued in recent years. Nevertheless, many small
firms are financially weak and vulnerable to shocks.

Risks are tilted to the downside (Annex II):



External risks have worsened since the UK referendum result and now prevail. The recent
UK vote to leave the EU, if accompanied by prolonged uncertainty over UK’s new relationship
with the EU, larger-than-expected slowdown in the UK and in the rest of Europe, and higher
financial market volatility, would have a significant adverse effect on Ireland. In these
circumstances, a countercyclical fiscal policy together with the central banks’ commitment to
provide additional liquidity, would help lessen the impact. Over the medium term, a possible
relocation of EU-oriented firms from the UK to Ireland could partly mitigate some of these
effects (Annex III). On the upside, the ongoing restructuring of operations by multinationals
could reinforce Ireland’s attractiveness as a destination for FDI and increase the capital stock.
A surge in financial market volatility in response to other shocks and disruptive re-allocation of
assets as investors reassess global growth prospects or as geopolitical tensions intensify could
further undermine confidence, with possible adverse effects on investment. At the same time,
the ECB’s QE, the government’s limited financing needs, and sizeable cash buffers (3½ percent
of GDP as of end-June 2016) would mitigate the impact on sovereign spreads. An extended
period of low euro area growth could also hurt confidence, investment, and FDI. Finally, while
Ireland benefitted from net immigration of highly–skilled European workers in the past, inflows
of refugees are expected to be small, with a limited fiscal impact.



Domestic risks seem moderate. Rising incomes and lower deleveraging could lift private
consumption and investment growth above the baseline, but continued rapid property price
growth could generate new vulnerabilities. Reform fatigue combined with strong growth are

fueling expectations of a recovery dividend among the Irish public, which together with
political fragmentation could lead to some policy reversals. The impaired credit channel
remains a medium-term risk if future demand for bank lending is not met with adequate
supply.
Ireland: Balance of Risks

13.
Ireland’s external position is broadly in line with fundamentals and the economy
remains competitive (Figure 5). The External Balance Assessment (EBA) methodologies suggest that
the external position is broadly in line with fundamentals and desirable policy settings (Annex IV).
The EBA Current Account approach indicates a slight undervaluation of the currency, but the current
account gap can be—to a large extent—explained by undistributed profits of foreign companies
that established their headquarters in Ireland. The External Sustainability and the Real Effective
Exchange Rate approaches suggest minor overvaluation. Competitiveness continues to be strong in
the services sector, and goods exports have also resumed robust growth, particularly in the
pharmaceutical sector that appears to be less cyclical than global trade. In addition, Ireland’s
traditional exports have performed strongly, benefiting from the depreciation of the euro. However,
some trade losses could be expected following a depreciation of sterling and a reduction of UK
demand (Annex III).

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

Authorities’ views
14.
The authorities broadly shared staff’s assessment regarding Ireland’s economic
outlook and risks. They saw prospects for robust real GDP growth, while somewhat decelerating
over the medium term. Continuous progress in resolution of financial crisis legacies alongside
increased market confidence should continue to support domestic demand, thus further reducing
the unemployment rate. They concurred with the external sector assessment and predominant
downside external risks reflecting the high degree of openness of the Irish economy. These include a
significant slowdown in major trading partners and the ensuing adverse changes in the terms of
trade, and heightened uncertainty regarding the prospects for many emerging market economies.
However, this is mitigated somewhat by the fact that its exports are concentrated in sectors, such as
pharmaceuticals, which are more resilient to external demand swings. Domestic factors, including
tight housing markets and its adverse effect on labor mobility and competitiveness, as well as
potential sectoral wage pressures could also pose downside risks. In addition, increased political
fragmentation could complicate policy making. However, better-than-expected domestic demand
and additional patent on-shoring represent potential upside.
15.
The UK vote to leave the EU has added further uncertainty to the outlook and will
adversely affect growth. The authorities’ initial estimate, based on the assessment in the
government’s Summer Economic Statement (SES), is that growth in 2017 will be about ½ percent
lower than previously expected, though the fiscal space for next year is largely fixed at this stage.
The authorities will prepare a full macroeconomic projection in advance of Budget 2017 in October,
and this will include updated estimates of economic growth, the public finances and the fiscal space,
taking account of actual and prospective developments up to that time, including the estimated
economic impact of the UK vote. The authorities have already published their contingency plans to
deal with financial market volatility, potential effects on export industries, and FDI flows.

REBUILDING RESILIENCE AND SUPPORTING
SUSTAINABLE AND INCLUSIVE GROWTH
Ireland’s strong growth performance provides an opportunity to tackle the remaining crisis legacies,
rebuild policy buffers, and increase the resilience of the economy to risks. Policies should focus on
further reducing public debt while enhancing spending efficiency, lessening private sector
vulnerabilities, improving bank balance sheets, and mitigating boom-bust cycles. Addressing structural
weaknesses would support robust and inclusive medium-term growth and job creation.

Ireland: Medium-Term Policy Priorities

A. Fiscal Policy
Continue rebuilding fiscal buffers, increase expenditure efficiency, and rebalance the tax mix
16.
Ireland is on track to further improve its fiscal position on the back of strong growth
(Figure 6). Some spending overruns, mainly in the health sector, are estimated to be more than
offset by higher-than-expected tax revenues due to their solid performance in the first months of
2016. As a result, staff project the fiscal deficit to narrow to 0.9 percent of GDP in 2016 and the
public debt to fall below 90 percent of GDP. Given that the global push for international taxation
reform and greater transparency make durability of exceptional CIT performance uncertain, staff
advocated saving any near-term unanticipated revenues and using them for debt reduction.
17.
Fiscal policy should aim to rebuild buffers. The high degree of openness of Ireland’s
economy increases its susceptibility to external shocks and the volatility of the business cycles
(Annex V). Against this backdrop and in the absence of monetary policy independence, staff
emphasized the need for continued reduction in public debt, thereby rebuilding room for counter-

cyclical fiscal policy.5 To this end, staff argued that in the case of Ireland, mere compliance with the
SGP rules might not be sufficiently prudent. Staff estimate that maintaining the medium-term
objective (MTO) of a structural budget deficit of 0.5 percent of GDP, once achieved, would imply an
unwarranted pro-cyclical fiscal policy given the positive output gaps estimated through 2021. Staff,
therefore, advocated that the authorities overachieve the MTO, with primary balance surpluses, over
the medium term. However, the inherent difficulties in correctly estimating Ireland’s cyclical position
warrant extra caution.6 Avoiding periodic upward revisions of the three-year expenditure ceilings
(thus compensating for possible overruns with other expenditure cuts) and saving potential tax
windfall gains would also crucially help to rebuild fiscal buffers.

18.
In line with staff’s recommendations, the government plans to address social needs
while ensuring sound public finances and durable debt reduction. In the Summer Economic
Statement (SES) released on June 21, the government expressed the intention to achieve a
structural budget deficit of 0.5 percent of GDP (MTO) by 2018. To this end, it allocates the fiscal
room available under the SGP rules 2:1 toward expenditure increases and tax reductions during
2017-21. While the specific policies remain to be detailed, the fiscal plans include room to
accommodate pent up spending needs, including those arising from demographic pressures. After
2018, as advocated by staff, the government intends to follow a countercyclical fiscal policy and save
a portion of the fiscal space.7 On the basis of the outlined plans, staff estimate that the
government’s objective of achieving the MTO by 2018 remains broadly within reach even under
staff’s scenario of mild spillovers from the UK vote to leave the EU, which results in a more
conservative growth outlook than that of the authorities which was published in April. Public debt is
projected to remain on a downward trend reaching around 76 percent of GDP by 2021. In the event
of a larger-than-expected fallout from the UK vote to leave the EU, the authorities should stand

Fiscal policy can be more supportive of job-rich growth. Priority should be given to
rebalancing the tax mix and broadening the tax base, while improving spending efficiency and
addressing infrastructure needs.
Rebalancing the tax mix would boost sustainable revenues and support job creation. Compared to
EU peers, Ireland’s tax system has a higher reliance on more distortionary direct taxes, less on
property and wealth taxes, while indirect taxes are about the EU average (Figure 7). In particular,
personal income taxation (PIT and Universal Social Charge-USC) has a relatively narrow base
(about 30 percent of households are exempted) and a relatively rapid progressivity (the top
marginal rates are among the highest in the OECD).8 This places a large tax burden on middleincome households, undermines female labor force participation, creates welfare traps for lowskilled worker, and discourages high-skilled worker migration to Ireland.9 Consideration could
thus be given to merging the USC into a more comprehensive PIT, with lower rates below the
median wage and a broader base. Potential revenue losses could be compensated by decreasing
the number of products with reduced and zero VAT rates and by faster scaling up the property



While recent budgets have reduced the top marginal rate (now below 50 percent for middle-income households
earning up to €70,044), the tax base has been narrowed by increasing the USC threshold and thus the proportion of
exempt households from 27 to 30 percent.

Enhancing spending efficiency would improve delivery of public services. By most metrics, Ireland
is a low spending country (see Selected Issues on Public Expenditure Efficiency in Ireland).
Moreover, expenditure is deemed to be generally efficient, especially for social spending where
the impact on income inequality reduction is the highest in the EU (Figure 8). Nonetheless, there
is scope for efficiency gains in the health sector. This would help generate resources needed to
mitigate aging-related spending pressures. To this end, it is critical that ongoing reforms
(strengthening of primary care, reform of hospital budgeting, lower expenditure due to greater
generic drug use) progress as planned.12 Furthermore, improved targeting of social transfers

class” countries with which Ireland competes for high value-added exports. Technology
infrastructure (broadband) and core infrastructure (power distribution and ports) need an
upgrade, and maintenance of the existing insfrastructure stock is not fully met.13 Public capital
expenditure should thus be scaled up and prioritized, thereby strengthening Ireland’s leading
edge in the global export markets. Strengthening the evaluation framework for public
investment would help maximize the growth impact.
Authorities’ views
20.
The government reiterated its broad objective to build a social economy based upon
sound public finances. The authorities were in broad agreement with the staff’s analysis and
agreed that Ireland’s high degree of economic volatility calls for adequate fiscal buffers to deal with
potential negative shocks. They also stressed the importance of avoiding procyclical fiscal policy,
hence the intention of establishing a rainy day fund. While the recovery is cementing, the authorities
observed that new challenges are emerging, in particular regarding the growing demand for
housing and the supply of critical infrastructure. The authorities indicated that the main gaps in
public transportation across regions, as well as in large cities, need to be addressed in order to
achieve a more regionally balanced economic growth. One of the key objectives of the government
is indeed to create additional 200,000 jobs by the end of this decade, mostly outside Dublin. The
authorities were mindful that demand pressures for healthcare ought to be addressed in an efficient
way. Value-for-money considerations and the continued focus on reform of public services remain a
key priority in the government’s policy agenda.
21.
The authorities affirmed their intention to achieve a stable tax mix and entrench the
progress made in recent years to broaden the tax base. Within this context, the authorities
expressed their intention to reform the income tax system—including a phasing out of the USC—
with a view to expanding the base while reducing the burden for lower and middle income earners.
This reform is seen as a key element in promoting employment growth. On corporate taxation, the
authorities recognized the wide uncertainty as to the transitory or more durable nature of the recent
CIT upswing. They agreed with staff that future short-term revenue windfalls should be saved, but
stressed that a better understanding of, inter alia, the structural drivers of corporate profitability was
a pre-requisite to effective medium-term tax forecasting. While agreeing on the possibility of
removing some VAT exemptions, the authorities highlighted the need to address them within a
European context. As for the current house price valuation freeze for property tax, they emphasized
the objective to maintain stable property tax revenues in the current upswing in the property
market.

B. Macro-Financial Policies
22.
Crisis legacies and property market swings need to be contained to enhance the
resilience of the private sector. The FSAP concluded that the banking sector is tightly connected
13

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

IRELAND
with Ireland’s real economy, but not with rest of the other financial sector.14 The FSAP also noted
that the financial soundness of banks, households, and corporates has improved in recent years, but
legacy issues amplify vulnerabilities to shocks. Solvency and liquidity stress tests under an adverse
macroeconomic scenario indicate that the Irish banking system would be significantly impacted,
with capital and leverage of several banks falling below certain hurdle rates (Annex VI).15 Policies
should, therefore, focus on strengthening the banking sector’s resilience and its ability to sustainably
support growth. Furthermore, the real estate market rebound raises concerns of potential emerging
imbalances.
23.
The recent UK vote to leave the EU could affect Ireland’s banking system through
various channels. Given the large uncertainties involved, it is difficult to quantify the direct and
indirect spillovers at this stage. However, there are a number of channels through which the banking
system could be affected. The profitability of Irish subsidiaries in the UK could be adversely affected
by the slowdown in the UK economy and the depreciation of the pound against the euro.
Furthermore, the downturn may lead to deterioration in banks’ asset quality, reflecting in part a fall
in UK property prices (particularly housing). In addition, Irish corporates that export to the UK may
face lower demand and profitability, which in turn could hamper their debt repayment capacity.
More broadly, slower economic activity in Ireland accompanied by higher unemployment could
affect lending volumes, NPLs, and bank profitability, and slow the repair of private sector balance
sheets. Heightened uncertainty and market volatility could increase bank funding costs, though the
heavy reliance on deposits lessens this risk. Liquidity risks are mitigated by central banks’
commitment to backstop liquidity in euros and other currencies to deal with the market volatility
following the referendum result.

Tackling crisis legacies

There are also close bank-sovereign financial linkages through banks’ holdings of government bonds and the
government’s holdings of bank equity. Meanwhile, the linkages between the banking system and the funds industry,
insurance companies, or pension funds are very limited.
14

The FSAP’s adverse macroeconomic scenario is more severe than the mild spillovers from the UK vote to leave the
EU assumed in staff’s projections.

Households’ repayment capacity must be safeguarded through prudent mortgage
lending. Banks are increasingly extending fixed-rate mortgages, though the vast majority of the
outstanding mortgages (90 percent of stock as of March 2016) is still at a variable rates. Staff
welcomed these developments noting that fixed-rate products will reduce households’
vulnerability to interest rate shocks, and stressed the need to ensure that banks adequately price
borrowers’ capacity to repay by using conservative assumptions on future interest rates and
incomes, while taking into account the difficulties in enforcing collateral, the ongoing
deleveraging process, and the legacy burden.

corporate sector. However, with high NPLs (13 percent of corporate loans in 2016Q1) and tight
credit conditions for SMEs, corporate vulnerabilities remain elevated. Furthermore, the ongoing
deleveraging reflects demand side factors as well as supply side constraints faced by Irish SMEs,
including higher borrowing costs and—albeit declining—elevated loan-application rejection rates
compared to their European peers. The FSAP’s analysis suggests that small firms have a higher share
of risky debt than larger enterprises, and that a decline in profitability and an increase in interest
rates would likely push many firms into a vulnerable state and increase new defaults (Annex VII).
Staff therefore called for continued pace of corporate NPL resolution, including through loan
restructuring for the most vulnerable, yet viable, firms. This would enhance the corporate sector’s
resilience to shocks and ability to support a durable expansion of economic activity. Staff also
underlined that closing data gaps on firm-level balance sheets would help the Central Bank of
Ireland detect and mitigate a buildup of new vulnerabilities at an early stage.

The disposal of the state’s shareholding in the banking system should continue. The
two state-owned banks—AIB and PTSB—made progress toward privatization in 2015. Following
successful equity issuance, PTSB reduced the government’s stakes to 75 percent from 99 percent in
April 2015, and covered the capital shortfall identified in the ECB’s 2014 comprehensive assessment.
AIB redeemed €1.4 billion of government’s preference shares and converted the remainder
(€2.1 billion) to ordinary shares in December 2015, thus clearing the way for additional equity sale.
The government announced plans to reduce its stakes in AIB to 75 percent, and further lower its
holdings in PTSB, but a specific timeline has yet to be set. Staff stressed that disposal should
continue to further reduce public debt and contain contingent liabilities, but acknowledged that
market conditions, including those resulting from the UK vote to leave the EU, could affect the
process.
28.
Further strengthening of banking supervision would help maximize the benefits of the
Single Supervisory Mechanism (SSM). The FSAP observed that the financial regulatory framework
has been significantly strengthened since the crisis and the Central Bank of Ireland has increased its
resources and deployed them in a more proactive manner than in the past. The SSM, in which the
ECB is responsible for direct supervision of the significant instititions that make up the bulk of the
Irish banking system, is working well: the Joint Supervisory Teams (JSTs) for Irish banks operate
effectively, and SSM methodologies, processes, and procedures are fully operational. In line with the
FSAP’s recommendations, staff underlined that the recent supervisory gains need to be preserved,
particularly in light of the possible changes to the banking industry landscape and business models.
Staff encouraged supervisors to continue enhancing their already considerable stress testing
capacity, which will help challenge commercial banks’ risk modeling. In view of the high turnover of
supervisory staff, review of personel policies would be appropriate to attract and retain experienced
supervisors.
Authorities’ views
29.
The authorities agreed that the recovery in the banking system is ongoing, yet
challenges persist. They noted that new lending is resuming and is helping to restore net interest
margins. However, continued system deleveraging, the low interest rate environment, and remaining
legacy issues present significant headwinds. The authorities concurred that lending rates should

24

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

IRELAND
adequately price these factors, as well as the risks associated with the Irish economy, including the
difficulties to realize collateral of distressed borrowers. The authorities pointed to the solid progress
made in the workout of impaired loans across all portfolios and stressed that the resolution of the
remaining NPLs is a key supervisory priority. In this regard, they indicated continued implementation
of the Distress Credit Strategy, which sets out supervisory expectations for the resolution of
mortgage arrears on a bank-by-bank basis while requiring banks to set quarterly resolution targets
for their commercial/corporate books. Furthermore, the forthcoming introduction of a government
funded scheme to allow distressed mortgage borrowers access to legal and financial advice should
help increase borrower-creditor engagement. To accelerate the legal proceedings, the Programme
for Government proposes to establish a special court to expeditiously handle mortgage arrears and
other personal insolvency cases, with designated judges that will ensure consistent rulings. The
authorities broadly agreed with the FSAP’s recommendations, and noted their plans to further
develop their stress testing capacity, reduce data gaps, and engage with the various stakeholders on
personnel policies to retain experienced staff. Finally, disposal of state shareholding in the banks will
be pursued with a view to maximizing the return to the state.

A potential buildup of new imbalances in the CRE market needs to be prevented.
Although CRE prices have surged since 2013, the buildup of new vulnerabilities in domestic banks
appears limited to date, as demand is mostly funded by foreign investors and domestic equity, such
as real estate investment trusts, compared to bank funding in the previous cycle (see Selected Issues
on Commercial Real Estate and the Supervisory Response). New CRE lending is increasing from low

Authorities’ view
33.
The authorities confirmed their commitment to reduce the risk of a boom-bust cycle.
The Central Bank of Ireland intends to maintain the macroprudential measures in place and
launched the first annual review of their impact and effectiveness, to be completed by November
2016. The authorities concurred that transitioning from LTI to DTI limit would serve as a better
instrument, but noted that the recalibration and implementation would require careful assessment
of the data submitted to the CCR once it becomes operational. With regard to the CRE market, the
Estimates by the Department of Environment suggests that the updated planning guidelines will lead to a cost
reduction of about €20,000 per unit or more on top of other cost savings that have been delivered through
reductions in local authority development charges.

authorities noted that the continued reduction in banks’ exposures to this segment limits the
potential risks to the domestic economy. Furthermore, construction activity, which has responded to
improving fundamentals, suggests that a large supply is in the pipeline, which will mitigate market
pressures going forward. The authorities are working to reduce data gaps and closely monitor CRE
developments. They stressed that resolving the housing shortage is of high priority. In particular, the
forthcoming Action Plan for Housing aims at delivering 25,000 new houses per year by the end of
this decade to better align demand and supply. In this context, they noted their intent to establish
an infrastructure fund for local authorities to help develop the supply of new housing, and shorten
the application process for new building permits. Additionally, the government has recently
introduced a vacant site levy that will become effective by 2018 to deter land hoarding.

would boost Ireland’s economic potential. Many
advanced economies experienced TFP moderation, possibly due to spillovers from the US
productivity slowdown and a resource shift toward lower-productivity sectors.17 Staff analysis of
Ireland (see Selected Issues on Firm-Level Productivity and its Determinants: The Irish Case) indicates
that, in recent years, TFP growth of SMEs has lagged behind that of large firms, and that medium
and large-sized foreign-owned firms outperformed their domestic peers. Moreover, the analysis
suggests that domestic firm-level factors, including limited access to finance, weak financial
soundness, and low research and development (R&D) activity, may have also contributed to the
slowdown in TFP growth. Staff encouraged the authorities to alleviate these potential impediments
by broadening financing options for SMEs and advancing NPL resolution. As gross domestic
expenditure on R&D is mainly financed by large enterprises and is below the OECD average, staff
also stressed the need to encourage higher innovation activities among domestic SMEs, including

Job-rich growth would foster inclusion. Despite the robust recovery, some parts of the
population have yet to feel its benefits. While the labor force is well educated, skill mismatches are
relatively high in some segments, and youth and long-term unemployment rates remain elevated,
the latter particularly among adults with lower educational attainment.20 Furthermore, female labor
force participation is among the lowest in the EU. Staff therefore advocated strengthening incentives
for women to enter the labor market, such as providing more affordable and high-quality child care
and reducing the high marginal income tax rates for second earners. To increase the overall labor
supply and boost youth employment, staff suggested upgrading labor skills and reducing skill
mismatches by strengthening labor activation policies and expanding technical and vocational
programs (see also Selected Issues on Public Expenditure Efficiency in Ireland).
Authorities’ view
37.
The authorities agreed with the need to enhance productivity and job creation in order
to support sustainable and inclusive growth. They noted the recently-introduced policy initiatives
to alleviate difficulties in SMEs’ access to finance, including the establishment of the Strategic
Banking Corporation of Ireland in 2015, which provides low cost funding for SMEs. Furthermore, the
expected implementation of the CCR would reduce firms’ informational asymmetry and hence the
risk premia charged by banks. They acknowledged that higher public spending on R&D would
enhance the business sector’s competitiveness and innovation capacity. They remain committed to
increase Ireland’s R&D intensity, improve SMEs’ access to finance for innovation, develop research
collaboration between enterprises and the public sector, and tailor support to meet enterprise
The share of budget funding in gross domestic expenditures on R&D declined to 26 percent in 2014 from about
34 percent in 2008, while government’s R&D expenditures per capita fell by 26 percent in nominal terms at the same
time.
18

19 Public support for Irish firms’ R&D is mainly through tax credits, but young firms lacking upfront funds to start
innovative projects may not benefit from it.

The OECD survey 2015 Survey of Adult Skills (PIAAC) suggests that, despite improvements in recent years, adults in
Ireland have lower skills than other OECD countries, especially regarding numeracy and literacy.

needs, as outlined in the recently published Innovation 2020 strategy report. The authorities stressed
their intent to foster reforms to improve the affordability and quality of child care. As outlined in
their Action Plan for Jobs for 2016, efforts are being made to step up the skill supply by helping
qualified workers to come to Ireland, and by establishing regional skills fora as a mechanism for
enterprises and providers of education and training to work together in building the supply of skills
for their regions.

purchases of about €1.1 billion a month, which is broadly equivalent to staff estimates of average
monthly gross financing needs in 2016-17.
39.
Medium-term financing needs appear manageable, and the falling public debt burden
reduces risks going forward. Strong growth and fiscal performance have dramatically lowered the
baseline public debt path, where further reduction is predicated on the authorities’ continued
commitment to fiscal prudence. Gross public debt fell to about 94 percent of GDP by end-2015, and
is expected to decline below 90 percent by end-2016—five years earlier than anticipated at the time
of the 2015 Article IV consultation. Ireland’s funding strategy has significantly smoothed mediumterm gross financing requirements, and it is likely that the projected hump in 2020 will be dealt with
well in advance through debt management operations. Finally, the 2021–23 period—when the
remaining liabilities to the IMF fall due—has relatively modest gross financing needs, further
lowering risks to the Fund.

STAFF APPRAISAL
40.
Ireland’s economic rebound has been exceptional, but the recovery is incomplete.
Robust domestic demand, particularly investment, and solid exports have supported the broadbased expansion. Unemployment has been steadily declining, and inflation has been subdued.
Public finances are strengthening and the government’s debt-to-GDP ratio continues on a
downward trend. Yet the recovery remains incomplete. Employment and consumption are still below
their pre-crisis levels. Crisis legacies, such as elevated public and private debt burdens and a high
stock of banks’ nonperforming loans, leave the economy vulnerable to shocks. The outlook remains
favorable, but risks—mainly external—are tilted to the downside, especially after the UK vote to
leave the EU.
41.
Policies should strengthen further the foundations for sustainable and inclusive longterm growth. There is a need to lock in recent gains and build upon them while tackling the
lingering crisis legacies, rebuilding policy buffers, and bolstering the resilience of the economy to
shocks. At the same time, a recurrence of another boom-bust economic cycle needs to be avoided
to allow strong, durable, and broad-based growth that will benefit all Irish people.
42.
Continued steady reduction in public debt would increase the policy buffers in the
event of potential negative shocks. Ireland has established a solid track record of fiscal rectitude
and exited the Excessive Deficit Procedure. Building on this progress, and in light of Ireland’s high
degree of economic volatility, adequate fiscal room for maneuver needs to be created to deal with
possible adverse shocks. In absence of major economic repercussions from the UK vote to leave the
EU, the policies outlined in the recent Summer Economic Statement appear broadly consistent with
the attainment of the MTO of a structural deficit of 0.5 percent of GDP by 2018, and further
improvement thereafter. This would prevent additional fiscal stimulus when economic activity is
projected to remain above potential and allow general government debt to decline significantly.
Should the repercussions from the UK vote to leave the EU be larger than anticipated, the
authorities should stand ready to take remedial actions, such as a countercyclical fiscal policy

30

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

IRELAND
together with central banks’ commitment to backstop liquidity in euros and other currencies—if and
when needed.
43.
Fiscal policy can be more supportive of job-rich growth. A rebalancing of the tax mix
away from distortionary direct taxes, including by merging the universal social charge into a broader
income tax with lower rates for below-median wage earners, would help reduce the tax burden on
middle-income households, foster female labor force participation, and reduce welfare-traps for
low-skilled workers. Implementation of a uniform VAT rate and faster scaling up of the property tax
would compensate for lower revenues from direct taxes. Regressivity arising from these changes
could be assuaged by means-tested transfers to low-income households. Enhancing spending
efficiency, particularly in the health sector, would improve delivery of public services, while a better
targeting of social transfers would improve inter-generational fairness. Capital expenditure,
particularly in infrastructure and R&D, should be increased to safeguard Ireland’s competitiveness.
44.
Recovery in the banking system is progressing, but challenges persist. Although banks’
financial soundness has improved in recent years, sensitivity analyses under the FSAP’s adverse
macroeconomic scenario point to vulnerabilities amplified by crisis legacies. Furthermore, the fallout
from the UK vote to leave the EU could undermine banks’ profitability and balance sheet repair. In
the current low-interest environment, supervisors need to be even more vigilant to ensure that
banks’ profit seeking is supported by appropriate risk management. Mortgage lending rates should
adequately reflect market conditions, legacy burden, and credit risk, including difficulties in realizing
collateral. Disposal of the government’s stakes in the banking system should continue. This would
further reduce public debt.
45.
The resilience of the nonfinancial private sector to shocks needs to be bolstered
further. Intensified supervisory efforts should continue to resolve nonperforming loans, supported
by the legal process to incentivize cooperation between borrowers and lenders. Further
restructuring of distressed loans to the most vulnerable, but viable, firms would support a durable
expansion of economic activity and reduce the corporate sector’s vulnerabilities. Closing data gaps
on firm level balance sheets would enable detection and mitigation of a buildup of new
vulnerabilities. Continued care is needed to ensure that provisions remain adequate.
46.
A potential buildup of new imbalances in the property market should be prevented.
Macroprudential limits on mortgage lending should be maintained as a permanent feature of the
mortgage market to safeguard the resilience of banks and households against shocks. The Central
Bank of Ireland intent to periodically assess the impact and effectiveness of these measures is
welcome. Once the Central Credit Register becomes operational, the loan-to-income limit should be
replaced with a debt-to-income limit, which better captures borrowers’ repayment capacity. As
housing supply remains constrained, additional policy actions should help expedite new
construction. Demand pressures in the commercial real estate market need to be closely monitored
and policy tools activated if risks to financial stability emerge.
47.
Residual structural weaknesses should be addressed to support a robust and inclusive
medium-term growth and job creation. Policies should encourage broadening of the financing

31

options available to SMEs and increasing direct public sector support of their innovation activities,
including through closer partnerships with education institutions. Furthermore, enhancing labor
activation policies and expanding technical and vocational programs would help retool skills and
increase the likelihood of finding employment. Policies to address the high cost of child care and its
variable quality, and reduce high marginal income tax rates on second earners would strengthen
incentives for women to enter the labor market.
48.
It is recommended that the next Article IV consultation with Ireland be held on the
standard 12-month cycle.

Annex I. Progress against IMF Recommendations
Several policy recommendations in the 2015 Article IV consultation have been taken on board.
Key recommendations
Further reduce public debt while
broadening the tax base, containing the
public wage bill, and improving the
targeting of social programs.

Implemented policies
Public debt ratio rapidly declined in 2015. Budget 2016 aims
for further consolidation, but includes measures that erode
the tax base. Additionally, the increase in social spending
could have been better targeted.

Advance the resolution of distressed
loans.

The government announced reforms to increase the utilization
of personal insolvency arrangements (May 2015); introduced
new court rules to shorten the legal proceedings (August
2015); reduced the bankruptcy discharge period to one year
from three years (December 2015).

Strengthen the financial resilience of
banks and borrowers.

New macro prudential measures on mortgage lending were
implemented (February 2015). Countercyclical Capital Buffer
was introduced (January 2016), and “Other Systemically
Important Institutions” buffer will be phased in 2019-21 in line
with the new EU banking regulations.

Take early actions to strengthen banks’
capital.

PTSB raised equity to cover capital shortfall (April 2015) while
AIB redeemed the remaining preference shares (December
2015).

Improve the construction supply
response.

The government launched a policy package comprising
measures to boost housing supply (November 2015).

Annex III. The Possible Economic Impact on Ireland of the UK
Vote to Leave the EU
1.
Ireland has tight economic linkages with the UK.1 Although the nature and the size of
economic consequences of Brexit on Ireland would depend on the eventual terms of the UK’s
withdrawal and its future relations with the EU involving a range of potential outcomes, the overall
assessment is that it is likely to have an adverse impact on Ireland.2
2.
Trade. The UK is Ireland’s single largest trading partner in Europe, with annual export of
goods and services of around €35 billion, or about 15 percent of Irish exports. The UK ranks second
only to the US in terms of Ireland’s global exports. The main export items comprise food and drink,
computers, and financial and transport services. The UK is a particularly important trading partner
for indigenous Irish firms, accounting for 43 percent of their exports in 2014, as opposed to
12 percent of foreign-owned companies’ exports. Overall, Irish exports could be negatively impacted
through several channels: (i) a potential significant depreciation of the sterling against the euro; (ii)
potential introduction of tariffs, customs requirements, as well as higher transactions and
compliance costs due to divergence in regulations; and (iii) a decline in the UK’s and the euro area’s
import demand from Ireland if the impact of Brexit on the UK economy and the euro area turns out
to be significantly negative.
3.
Labor movement and travel. The UK and Ireland form a common travel area, without
border controls between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland being one of the major
benefits. The UK is an important destination for labor migration of Irish nationals, especially at times
of high domestic unemployment. Brexit could open up the possibility of labor movement
restrictions and changes to the common travel area, potentially affecting tourism.
4.
Energy. Ireland is highly connected to the UK energy market, with 90 percent of energy
products coming from the UK in 2014. A potential introduction of tariffs on EU energy exports to the
UK could raise energy costs there, and these costs could be passed on to Ireland, thus hurting
Ireland’s competitiveness. Brexit could also affect the Irish energy sector through the operation and
degree of integration of the Irish electricity market with the UK market, climate change policy,
security of oil and gas supplies, as well as gas storage.
5.
Foreign direct investment. A potential benefit of Brexit for Ireland could arise from higher
FDI flows, which could relocate from the UK to Ireland given uncertainties about access to the single
market. However, a recent ESRI empirical analysis suggests that the positive impact on Ireland’s
attractiveness as a location for FDI would be marginal.

Central Bank of Ireland (2015), “Macro-Financial Review (2015:II)”.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

IRELAND
6.
Financial sector. Ireland could also benefit from the relocation of some financial institutions
from the UK to Ireland due to the possible loss of the EU “passport rights”, which allow them to sell
services across the EU. On the other hand, recent CBI analysis suggests that, given strong linkages,
an exit of the UK from the EU could have a significant negative impact on Irish banks, insurance
firms and non-bank financial intermediaries, if it occurred in a disorderly manner and/or had a large
negative impact on the UK economy. Banking sector profitability could be negatively impacted as a
result of any slowdown in the UK economy, particularly through reduced lending to exporters
dependent on UK markets, and a decline in real estate markets as Irish banks have sizeable UK
property-related exposures. As there is a substantial cross-border life and non-life business between
Ireland and the UK, the insurance sector could also be adversely affected. Finally, for non-bank
financial intermediaries, the potential loss of access to the UK client base might have a negative
impact on business, although the exit of UK competitors from the market might benefit other firms.
7.
Contingency plans.3 The authorities have published contingency plans to deal with market
volatility, potential adverse effects on export industries, and FDI flows. They continue to monitor
developments and adjust their actions and mitigation strategies on an ongoing basis.

Annex IV. External Balance and Competitiveness Assessment
A range of External Balance Assessment (EBA) methodologies suggests that the external position is
broadly in line with fundamentals and desirable policy settings. Ireland’s competitiveness has further
improved in recent years, manifested in strong growth of goods and services exports, particularly in
pharmaceuticals and information technology (IT) services. Ireland is a booming hub for service
industries, non-pharmaceutical goods exports have managed to reclaim some market share since
2012, and strong FDI inflows serve as proof of investors’ continued favorable assessment of the
country’s business-friendly environment. Some trade losses could be expected following a depreciation
of sterling and reduction of UK demand on the back of the UK vote to leave the EU (Annex III).

A.

External Balance Broadly in Equilibrium

Current Account and Exchange Rates
1.
External Balance Assessment methodologies indicate that the external position is
broadly in line with fundamentals and desirable policy settings. The real exchange rate has
fallen markedly in the years following the crisis— Real Effective Exchange Rates
(Index, 1999Q1=100)
especially when measured on a unit labor cost
130
(ULC) basis—with a further notable decline in

euro. The Current Account (CA) approach

suggest slight overvaluation. In case of the REER
approach, health expenditures are the largest contributor to the policy gap.

2.
Redomiciled firms may explain the bulk of the estimated positive current account
balance gap. The apparent contradiction between the CA- and REER-based approaches can be
reconciled by the proliferation of “redomiciled firms”, enterprises which only establish their
headquarters in Ireland to consolidate their profits for taxation at the Irish corporate tax rate. Having

IRELAND
risen rapidly in the period 2009-2012, the undistributed profits of these companies seem to have
reached a plateau in 2013 and 2014. FitzGerald (2014) estimates that retained earnings contributed
around 3.7 percent of GDP to the current account balance in 2014, which would eliminate the
estimated undervaluation.
Capital Account Flows and International Investment Position (IIP)
3.
Ireland’s capital account is dominated by the International Financial Services Center
(IFSC), which serves as a hub for international financial transactions. The IFSC accounted for
around 90 percent of overall portfolio flows in 2015, and IFSC inflows and outflows were closely
matched. As a result the IFSC’s IIP was very close to balance, with the overall net IIP dominated by
the non-IFSC sector. In this respect, it should be noted that although Ireland is a large FDI recipient,
its net direct investment position is in fact positive. This is due in part to large positive valuation
effects associated with redomiciled firms’ foreign assets.

B.

Competitiveness

5.
Ireland’s strong export performance in 2015 was driven both by the goods and
services sectors, pharmaceuticals and computer services in particular. Exports of goods relative
to GDP resumed their growth since 2013 following a pause due to the “patent cliff” in 2011-2013.
The patent cliff also held back Ireland’s share in total global trade of its major pharmaceutical
products (Figure 1). As a result, goods exports have fallen notably in relation to international goods
trade, from 1.5 percent of world exports in 2002 to around 0.8 percent by 2013. Since then, they
have started to recover mainly due to the recovery of pharmaceutical exports. On the other hand,
exports of services, predominantly computer services, have steadily increased. This has also
translated into Ireland’s rapidly increasing share in world services exports.
6.
The assessment of developments in goods exports is complicated by “contract
manufacturing” in the pharmaceutical sector. Exports of goods reported in the national accounts
have been growing much faster than those recorded at the customs since 2014. The wedge between
the two types of trade has increased from 11 percent in 2013 to 22 percent in 2015. This discrepancy
can be traced in part to the proliferation of contract manufacturing—exports of goods
manufactured abroad by companies headquartered in Ireland. Such exports are part of GDP as the
goods remain in the ownership of the Irish resident company. The issue is most important in the
pharmaceutical sector, particularly with the recovery of pharmaceutical export following the patent
cliff.
7.
Ireland’s attractiveness as a destination for foreign direct investment has increased
further. Following a brief period of decline between 2010 and 2013, Ireland’s share in EU and world
inward FDI has picked up strongly, supported by strong economic performance, improving business
efficiency, and—despite relatively high skill mismatches in some segments—its educated workforce
(Figure 2).

Annex V. Debt Sustainability Analysis
Ireland’s public debt sustainability has improved substantially compared to what projected in the 2015
Article IV consultation. This improvement stems from the combination of prudent fiscal policy, strong
growth, and favorable financing conditions. The debt dynamics are robust to most shocks; under the
contingent liability shock, the public debt ratio deteriorates in the short run before resuming its
downward trend. Gross financing needs remain moderate. Asset sales still present an upside risk to the
debt trajectory. High external financing requirements and the high share of debt held by non-residents
pose potential vulnerabilities. However, the former reflects intra-company and intra-group debt of
large multinational corporations operating in Ireland, which is regularly rolled-over. The external debt
of the non-IFSC sector, albeit still high, has declined rapidly in the last few years and it is projected to
continue on a downward path over the forecast period. Moreover, non-resident holders are mainly
real-money investors with long-term investment plans.

Public Debt Sustainability
1.
Rapid nominal GDP growth as well as revisions to historical GDP have lowered Irish
debt stock substantially in 2015. The upward revision of GDP series in mid-2014 (see Box 1 of the
Staff Report on Fourth Post-program Monitoring Discussions) led to a decrease of end-2014 debtto-GDP ratio to 107.5 percent from 110 percent. The lower starting point, together with a large
increase in nominal GDP in 2015 (13.5 percent), resulted in a substantial decline of the debt-to-GDP
ratio to 93.8 percent at end-2015—about 15 percentage points lower than projected at the time of
the 2015 Article IV.
2.
The baseline debt outlook has
improved substantially relative to the DSA in
the 2015 Article IV report. This improvement
results essentially from a set of positive
macroeconomic developments and outlook,
particularly the large nominal increase in GDP
arising from the robust growth, and the
associated revenue buoyancy and falling fiscal
deficit:




Better growth prospects. The upward revision
to historical GDP data and better growth
prospects have improved the debt dynamics.
Improved financing conditions. The ECB’s
quantitative easing program has been
extended and broadened in 2015 and early
2016, and thus the financing conditions are
likely to remain benign for most of 2016,

despite some widening of Irish sovereign bond spreads following the UK vote to leave the EU.
Irish long-term yields have remained below 1 percent. The NTMA has already funded the
majority of its requirement for 2016, raising some €6 billion of its full-year target of €610 billion, thus locking in the favorable borrowing conditions. The baseline interest rate
trajectory is, nonetheless, embedding conservative projections, and rates are assumed to go
back to around 3½ percent by the end of the forecasting period.
3.
Despite a much lower debt ratio, the heat map and fan charts indicate that Ireland still
faces high debt sustainability risks (Figure 1). The debt burden threshold placing advanced
economies into the “high risk” category is 85 percent of GDP. Although Ireland is now on track to
cross this threshold in 2018, at 93.8 percent of GDP at end-2015 it is still classified as highly
vulnerable under all scenarios, regardless of the extent to which a shock increases debt. The debt
profile under all stress scenarios remains below 95 percent of GDP reached under the contingent
liability shock. Gross Financing Needs (GFN) remain moderate under all stress test scenarios,
peaking at 13.7 percent of GDP at most under the combined macro-fiscal shock, but remaining
below the vulnerability threshold of 20 percent in all cases. High external financing requirements
and public debt held by non-residents exceed the upper risk assessment benchmarks for these
indicators, raising a high risk flag on the debt profile. However, the former reflects intra-company
and intra-group debt of large multinational corporations operating in Ireland, which is regularly
rolled-over. The external debt of the non-IFSC sector, albeit still high, has declined rapidly in the last
few years and it is projected to continue on a downward path over the forecast period. Moreover,
non-resident holders are mainly real-money investors with long-term investment plans.
4.
There is no evidence of a systematic projection bias in the baseline assumptions for
key macroeconomic variables. The median forecast errors for real GDP growth and the primary
balance during 2005–13 are below 1 percent and in line with other countries (Figure 2). Individual
large forecast errors for growth, primary balance, and inflation mostly arise during the crisis period,
especially for the primary balance where there were very large unforeseen bank recapitalization
costs.
5.
Ireland’s fiscal adjustment is projected to improve its primary balance to above its
debt stabilizing threshold (Figure 3). The projected change in the cyclically-adjusted primary
balance is slightly below the top quartile of fiscal adjustments observed in advanced and emerging
market countries with debt greater than 60 percent of GDP. This projected adjustment, while
reflecting a slowing structural adjustment effort, is also the consequence of diminishing needs for
adjustment as the country is getting closer to the medium-term objective (MTO). Nonetheless, the
Irish government expressed the intention to over-perform its MTO of a structural deficit of 0.5
percent over the medium term.
6.
The large growth-interest rate differential will continue to drive Ireland’s debt ratio
lower in the coming two years (Figures 3 and 4). The interest rate-growth differential contributes,
according to staff projections, to most of the decline in the debt ratio over 2016-2017 (about
-5 percent of GDP). Thereafter, the debt ratio is projected to record more modest declines and be

60

IRELAND
driven by a combination of automatic debt dynamics, and a headline surplus. GFN are projected to
peak at about 12 percent of GDP in 2020, before dropping back to about 5 percent in 2021.
7.
The projected decline in public debt remains vulnerable to a number of shocks
(Figure 5). Key risks include:


Growth shock. If projected real GDP growth rates for 2016–17 are lowered by one half of a
standard deviation, the debt-to-GDP ratio peaks at 90 percent in 2018 (compared with
83.6 percent under the baseline) before declining.1



Interest rate shock. In the medium term, Ireland is shielded from a rise in interest rates by its
still-high share of fixed-rate bonds, its EU/IMF and other official sector borrowing, and by
relatively low financing needs in coming years (small rollover needs). The assumed interest rate
increase on new borrowing affects the debt trajectory only marginally.



Macro-fiscal shock. If slower growth in 2016–17 were accompanied by a primary balance
shock2 and by an increase in interest rates on new borrowing by 2 percentage points, the debt
ratio would rise to about 90 percent of GDP in 2018 and resume its declining trajectory
thereafter, reaching about 85 percent of GDP in 2021. In this scenario, gross financing needs
increase by about 1.6 percentage points of GDP on average over the medium term, reaching
13.7 percent at most in 2020.



Contingent liability shock. Remaining sources of financial sector contingent liabilities include:
(i) risks that bank provisions are inadequate to cover losses on their large NPLs; (ii) shortfalls in
the crystallized value of NAMA assets; and (iii) costs related to the restructuring of the credit
union sector, although these are contained by the size of the sector, with net loans being only
1½ percent of GDP. Without estimates of the potential realization of these contingencies, a
scenario assuming a 10 percent of GDP shock is used.3 Such a shock, if combined with the above
growth shock, would push gross public debt to around 94 percent of GDP in 2017 before
declining to about 86 percent by 2021.

8.
Despite the recent shock to bank stock valuations, asset sales still present an upside
risk to debt trajectories. Current baseline assumptions do not incorporate proceeds from any
further state asset disposals of stakes in the banks. Recent valuations of state holdings conclude that
A one-half standard deviation shock, instead of a default one standard deviation shock, is applied to the growth rate
to adjust for the exceptionally volatile growth rates during the recent boom-bust years.
1

A shock equivalent to the full size of the planned fiscal adjustment over the medium term is used, which worsens
primary balances by an average of 1.1 percentage points of GDP. A larger temporary shock derived from baseline
primary balance minus one-half of the 10-year historical standard deviation is not yet appropriate, given the
exceptionally high primary deficits (reflecting bank recap costs) during the crisis years.
2

3 A 10 percent of GDP shock is used, instead of a default shock of 10 percent of banking sector assets (equivalent to
around 30 percent of GDP), taking into account the 40 percent of GDP of public support to the financial sector already
incurred.

the sale of all state participation would generate about 5 percent of GDP based on end-March 2016
stock prices.

External debt sustainability analysis
9.
While still high, the external debt of the non-IFSC sector has declined rapidly in the
last few years, and is projected to continue its fast decline as a percent of GDP. 4 External debt
reached its peak in 2010 at around 320 percent of GDP, and fell to around 250 percent of GDP by
end-2015 (Table 1). This gross debt figure includes debt of large multinational corporations,
including both intra-company and intra-group debt, which is sizable in Ireland (around 50 percent of
total non-IFSC external debt in 2015) because the Irish entity often acts as a group treasury that also
has large financial assets. The intra-company and intra-group debt is regularly rolled over, and thus
helps explain the high annual gross external financing needs to a large extent, therefore mitigating
external vulnerabilities. The debt decline in recent years mostly represented a continued drop in the
Target 2 liabilities of the Central Bank of Ireland as banks reduced their reliance on Eurosystem
funding, as well as a significant fall in banks’ short-term debt. External debt of the general
government has flattened in nominal terms since the last tranches of the EU-IMF program were
disbursed in late 2013/early 2014. External debt is expected to continue falling, but this is subject to
some risks, as all shock scenarios would suggest more gradual reductions in public debt with the
interest rate shock having the lowest impact among the historical scenarios. The external debt ratio
increases to 162-169 percent of GDP under standardized shocks to the non-interest current account
and growth, as well as the combined scenario (Figure 6). Including the IFSC, total external debt
remains very high at 815 percent of GDP. Although IFSC debt has declined considerably in recent
years, it picked up in 2015, in particular on account of direct investment debt.

4

The discussion focuses on the non-IFSC sector, as the IFSC principally serves nonresidents.

Annex VI. FSAP Key Conclusions and Recommendations
1.
The Irish financial system has strengthened significantly since the crisis but key
vulnerabilities remain. While most financial institutions, and in particular the major banks, seem to
have built up buffers of capital and liquidity, the FSAP bank stability analysis identified and
quantified certain vulnerabilities, notably towards the real estate sector, the sovereign, and funding
in pound sterling. Among bank counterparts, pockets of weakness were identified, notably among
highly leveraged households. Connections among Irish banks and from them to other financial
centers—except the UK—seem to have attenuated over time. Cross-border connections
predominate in the funds management industry, which is now of global scale. Still, domestic
commercial banks have only limited connections with the funds industry.
2.
Financial regulation and supervision have been much strengthened since the crisis, based on
recognition of the need to address the vulnerabilities summarized in this report and detailed in the
accompanying Financial System Stability Assessment (FSSA). Several of the areas for improvement
identified through the recent assessments of observance of the main financial standards have been
tackled (see IMF Country Reports 14/135, 14/137, and 15/117). Across the financial system, the
authorities have updated regulations to implement relevant EU Directives and refine national
legislation. More off-site analysis and on-site supervision—of individual institutions and related to
cross-cutting themes such as cyber-risk and the economic consequence of the UK vote to leave the
EU—is being undertaken. Staff resources has been expanded substantially, although the retention of
experienced personnel is proving difficult. The increased regulatory burden and intrusiveness of
supervision, and the necessary independence, demand a high degree of accountability from
supervisors.
Regarding individual sectors:








70

The Single Supervisory Mechanism (SSM) for banks, in which the ECB is responsible for
direct oversight of the “significant institutions” that make up the bulk of the Irish banking
system, seems to be working well. It is generally recognized that, as experience is gained
with the SSM, further streamlining of certain supervisory processes and regulatory
harmonization (such as on licensing and branch authorizations) will yield efficiency gains;
The complex Solvency II regulations for insurers have been shepherded in. Some current
priorities relate to enhancing cross-border supervisory coordination, and ensuring that
insurers manage credit risk with due care;
Securities market regulation continues to evolve quickly, for example, with regard to the
capital and governance regime for securities firms, and the protection of investors’ funds in
winding-up cases. The authorities have undertaken a major effort to gather necessary data
and perform analysis of possible systemic risks associated with the funds management
industry;
Macroprudential supervision and policy actions have been ramped up, at both a national
and a European level; and



Financial system safety nets and the resolution framework have been transformed by the
recent establishment of the Single Resolution Mechanism. Effort now has to go into
optimizing the operations of the revamped system and addressing some transition issues.

Annex VII. Vulnerabilities of Household and Corporate Sectors1
Household sector
1.
Since the outbreak of the crisis, households have deleveraged, but are still highly
indebted. Household debt-to-disposable income ratio declined to 155.1 percent in 2015Q4
(€151 billion or 74 percent of GDP), but still the Irish household indebtedness is one of the highest
in Europe.

2.
A sizable share of mortgage loans (23 percent) remains in negative equity, and almost
all mortgages (93 percent) have variable interest rates. Negative equity is a well-documented
cause of default.2 As of 2015Q2, tracker loans (linked to ECB interest rates) and standard variable
rate (SVR) loans accounted for 51 percent and 41 percent of total mortgages, respectively. Interest
rates on existing tracker mortgages are currently very low, reflecting the ECB policy rate. However, if
interest rates rise, interest payments will increase and some households may face difficulties
servicing their debts.
3.
Staff’s analysis indicates that existing borrowers with high loan-to-value (LTV) ratios
or standard variable rates are more vulnerable to shocks than other groups of households
under the FSAP adverse scenario.3 There is a positive relationship between LTV groups and the
stressed probability of default (PD). At an LTV ratio of over 150 percent, the PD under adverse
scenario exceeds 20 percent. This segment of households includes younger borrowers, first-time
buyers (FTBs), and borrowers outside Dublin. Tracker mortgages have an average PD of 6 percent in
1 Findings are based on FSAP’s technical note on non-banks sector stability analysis by Heedon Kang (MCM), Nir
Klein (EUR), and Fergal McCann (CBI).

See Lydon and McCarthy (2011) and Kelly and O’Malley (2016).

Predicted three-year probability of default for performing loans as of December 2014 is projected under the FSAP
baseline and adverse scenarios using the CBI’s Loan-Loss-Forecasting (LLF) model. See Technical Note on Non-Bank
Sectors. The assumptions underpinning the stress scenarios are described in the accompanying FSSA.

the adverse scenario, as opposed to a predicted rate of closer to 10 percent for SVR customers. The
magnitude of predicted default probabilities suggests that key vulnerabilities persist in the Irish
mortgage system, even among those not included in the high stock of defaulted loans, such as FTBs
and young households, because of their high current LTV ratios.4

Corporate sector
4.
The activity level of the corporate
sector in Ireland has risen significantly
recently. Following a sharp downturn in 200809, the activity in the corporate sector has
rebounded rapidly in recent years and has
exceeded that seen in many of its euro area
peers. The robust performance was
accompanied with an increase in profitability,
which supported the sector’s strong investment
activity without relying heavily on debt issuance.
Accordingly, the sector continued to deleverage.

leverage ratios and higher profitability, while the share of risky debt (i.e. owned by firms with ICR
lower than one) in total debt has declined to the pre-crisis level of about 10 percent in 2013 from
15 percent in 2009.5
6.
Still, the corporate sector’s vulnerabilities remain elevated. While firms’ financial health
has generally improved, SMEs remain particularly vulnerable as they account for most of the firms
that are under “technical default” (with ICR of less than one). Moreover, the analysis shows that the
share of risky debt among small firms (with less than 50 employees) constituted nearly one half of
small firms’ total debt compared to 9 percent among medium-sized firms and 2 percent among
large firms. The analysis also shows that the financial health of foreign subsidiaries operating in
Ireland is significantly better than that of domestic firms.
7.
A sensitivity analysis indicates that corporates, and especially smaller firms, remain
highly vulnerable even to moderate shocks. An adverse shock, which comprises a decline in
profitability and an increase in interest rates, is likely to push many firms into a vulnerable state. In
particular, the share of firms with ICR lower than one would triple to 47 percent from 16½ percent in
the baseline, with more than half of this related to the deterioration in the financial health of small
firms. In such a scenario, the share of risky debt would increase to about 15 percent, similar to the
level observed during the financial crisis.
8.
The analysis suggests that further efforts are needed to strengthen the corporate
sector’s resilience. Continued corporate NPL resolution, including through loan restructuring for
the most vulnerable, yet viable, firms would allow the remaining companies to invest and support a
durable expansion of economic activity. At the same time, policies should support the exit of
unproductive or unviable firms.

5 The interest cover ratio is calculated as the ratio between the firms’ earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and
amortization (EBITDA), and the firms’ interest expenses.

Annex VIII. Do Property Prices Diverge from Equilibrium?1
1.
Residential and commercial real estate prices in Ireland have been increasing rapidly in
recent years, raising concerns about possible overvaluation and a build-up of new imbalances. An
analysis that is based on both non-parametric and parametric methods suggests that the residential
property market is close to or moderately below its equilibrium level, while the CRE market shows
more mixed results.
Residential Real Estate (RRE) Market
2.
Non-parametric approach: The standard metrics of price-to-income and price-to-rent
ratios suggest that, following a protracted period of over-valuation prior to the crisis and a
correction afterwards, the market was close to its

2013-14, but dropped in the beginning of 2015 with the implementation of the new macroprudential measures.

Commercial Real Estate (CRE) Market

Non-parametric approach: The CRE
price-to-rent ratio suggests that following a
sharp correction at the onset of the crisis, CRE
prices increased above their historical averages
in 2014, and, at 2015Q3, they were moderately
overvalued at about 10 percent.

Parametric methods: While the
frequency and HP filters show that the CRE
prices have recently converged to their longterm trends, econometric models show a

STATISTICAL ISSUES
A. Assessment of Data Adequacy for Surveillance
General: Data provision is broadly adequate for surveillance.
National accounts and real sector data. Quarterly national accounts are currently published
within three months of its reference period. Other real sector data are relatively timely, with
industrial production and retail sales data published within six weeks and employment data
within 3 months of the reference period, but some non-SDDS series are published one and a half
years later (e.g., household disposable income). Employment and unit labor costs, and national
income and expenditure data are usually available with a three-month lag.
Wages and earnings statistics. The quarterly Earnings, Hours and Employment Costs Survey has
replaced the four-yearly Labor Cost Survey, and also replaces all other existing short-term
earnings surveys. The results are comparable across sectors and include more detail on
components of earnings and labor costs than was available before. However, data are only
available with more than a six-month lag.
Government finance statistics. The authorities publish Exchequer returns and indicative
estimates of the general government balance on a monthly basis. The definitive general
government balance is reported quarterly and annually. Ireland reports these data to STA
through a conversion of the datasets reported to Eurostat under the “ESA Transmission
Programme”.
Monetary and financial statistics: The ECB reporting framework is used for monetary statistics
and data are reported to the IMF through a “gateway” arrangement with the ECB. The
arrangement provides an efficient transmission of monetary statistics to the IMF and for
publication in the IMF’s International Financial Statistics (IFS).
Financial sector surveillance: Ireland reports FSIs for deposit takers, other financial
corporations, and real estate markets on a regular basis for posting on the IMF’s FSI website.
External sector statistics. Quarterly balance of payments (BOP) and international investment
position (IIP) data are compiled by the Central Statistics Office. The authorities implemented the
sixth edition of the Balance of Payments and International Investment Position Manual (BPM6).
The most recent BOP and IIP data reported to STA and disseminated in the IFS are for Q4/2015.
Ireland reports data for the Coordinated Portfolio Investment Survey (CPIS), the Coordinated
Direct Investment Survey (CDIS), and the Data Template on International Reserves and Foreign
Currency Liquidity.
