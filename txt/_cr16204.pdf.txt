IMF Executive Board Concludes 2016 Article IV Consultation with
Trinidad and Tobago
On May 20, 2016, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded the
Article IV Consultation1 with Trinidad and Tobago.
Trinidad and Tobago’s output has continued to shrink while declines in global energy prices are
leading to surging fiscal deficits and are pushing the external current account into deficit. Energy
output is sharply lower due to supply-side constraints. Combined with weak non-energy growth, real
GDP is estimated to have declined 2.1 percent in 2015 and is expected to fall another 2.7 percent in
2016. The lower energy prices and weaker growth have contributed to a steep fall in fiscal revenues,
raising the FY 2014/15 (October to September) deficit to 4.7 percent of GDP, and once the full-year
impact is felt, to a projected 10.9 percent of GDP in FY 2015/16.2 In addition, lower energy prices
reversed Trinidad and Tobago’s usual current account surplus, with the current account estimated at
a deficit of 5.4 percent in 2015, while gross official reserves fell from US$11.3 billion to US$9.8
billion during 2015. Core inflation remained anchored at 2.0 percent yoy in 2015, while headline
inflation fell to 1.5 percent (yoy). Unemployment remained low (3.6 percent in September 2015), in
part as make-work programs continue to facilitate employment, though layoffs are picking up.
The new government has undertaken fiscal adjustments intended to bring the economy back into
balance. It introduced new revenue measures with the FY 2015/16 budget, and made further
adjustment measures mid-year when it became clear that even the seemingly conservative energy
price assumptions in the budget were overoptimistic, due to the subsequent continued decline in
energy prices. The Central Bank began tightening monetary policy to mitigate capital outflows
beginning in late 2014, before pausing in January 2016. Although the currency has been allowed to
depreciate modestly against the U.S. dollar, external balance models suggest the currency remains
substantially overvalued (although the degree of overvaluation is subject to uncertainty due to
historical shortcomings in domestic data), while foreign exchange shortages persist. Banks remain
strong, while there has been some progress on structural reforms, notably with respect to a

Executive Board Assessment3
Executive Directors noted that the recent sharp decline in energy prices is posing major challenges to
Trinidad and Tobago’s economy. Directors welcomed the efforts taken by the new government and
encouraged further policy actions, including additional fiscal consolidation and structural reforms, to
preserve macroeconomic stability, diversify the economy, and enhance medium-term growth
prospects.
Directors concurred that a strong medium-term fiscal plan is needed to re-establish a sustainable
fiscal path and ensure debt sustainability. They commended the authorities for the important steps
taken thus far and encouraged them to put in place a comprehensive fiscal framework to guide their
multi-year adjustment efforts. Directors agreed that priority should be given to broadening the
revenue base with a comprehensive VAT reform, improving tax administration, phasing out fuel
subsidies, while improving targeted social protection. In this context, they also welcomed the
authorities’ intention to pursue a comprehensive expenditure review.
Directors supported the current pause in monetary policy tightening given the challenges to growth.
They noted that while the immediate policy priority is to focus on maintaining external balance,
addressing foreign exchange shortages on current transactions would be important. Directors noted
that a well-communicated move to greater exchange rate flexibility, as part of a comprehensive
demand-management package, would help strengthen the foreign exchange market and support the
needed macroeconomic adjustment. Some Directors highlighted the importance of mitigating
volatility in the foreign exchange market, and recommended a careful adjustment strategy.
Directors noted that strong comprehensive structural reforms are needed to achieve sustained and
inclusive growth over the medium term. They emphasized the importance of pushing ahead with
energy sector taxation reforms, addressing inefficiencies in the public service, and strengthening
financial sector supervision and regulation, particularly the non-bank financial regulatory
framework. They also welcomed ongoing efforts to further strengthen the AML/CFT framework.
Directors encouraged continued efforts to reform the labor market, improve the business climate,
and make further progress on the establishment of a tax policy unit and the National Statistical
Institute to address the remaining shortcomings.

STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2016 ARTICLE IV CONSULTATION
May 5, 2016

KEY ISSUES
Sharply declining energy prices and shrinking output constitute major fiscal
challenges. In a baseline scenario, fiscal deficits exceed 10 percent of GDP through the
medium-term, with an unsustainable increase in government debt. Although the
authorities have adopted serious fiscal measures since taking office in September 2015,
further declines in energy prices have moved the goalposts. A substantial multi-year
fiscal adjustment of around 8 ½ percent of GDP will be needed to keep the debt burden
manageable. There is scope to raise revenues including via comprehensive VAT reform,
and to rationalize spending with a broad expenditure review.
With current account deficits for the foreseeable future, further depreciation could
help restore external balance. Despite modest depreciation, staff estimates suggest the
currency remains substantially overvalued, while foreign exchange shortages persist.
Balance of payments pressures are also reportedly being exacerbated by capital outflows,
due both to precautionary demand and speculation on the currency. A larger
depreciation as part of a broader adjustment package could quell speculation and allow
for stabilizing the exchange rate at a lower level, and would also raise fiscal revenues and
help offset the contractionary impact of the needed fiscal adjustment. The recent pause
in monetary policy tightening is appropriate.
Structural reforms are needed on a range of fronts. Growth and diversification would
be aided by reforming labor markets, improving the public service and further removing
impediments to doing business. Although the banking system is sound, legislative action
is needed to strengthen the non-bank financial regulatory framework. A strong start has
been made on remedying severe statistical shortcomings.

2.
The long-standing current account surplus turned into a 5.4 percent of GDP deficit in
2015 (Figure 2).2 The reversal is mostly due to a sharp drop-off in energy exports. With energy prices
having fallen some 40 percent during 2015, exports are estimated to have declined from
US$11.8 billion in 2014 to US$9.1 billion in 2015. Relatively expansionary fiscal policy in FY 2014/15
(October-September), growth in consumer credit, and robust foreign direct investment (FDI) raised
capital and consumer imports. After an overall balance of payments surplus in 2014, reserves
declined US$1.5 billion in 2015, albeit to a still comfortable US$9.8 billion (13.4 months of imports).
Heritage and Stabilization Fund (HSF) assets increased by $212 million over the prior 12 months to
US$5.8 billion in June 2015.
3.
The significant terms-of-trade shock implies that the real effective exchange rate has
become more overvalued. Estimates using two methodologies under the EBA-lite framework
indicate a sizeable real effective exchange rate gap: 23 percent using the Current Account model,
consistent with the large current account gap of -5.6 to -7.6 percent of GDP, and 50 percent under
the Real Effective Exchange Rate (REER) Model (though the latter may be exaggerated due to
ongoing measurement issues with headline inflation; Annex I). The terms-of-trade shock in 2015
explains some of the overvaluation. However structural impediments, domestic policy gaps relative
to other countries and the appreciation of the US and US dollar pegged currencies (60 percent of
trade) vis-á-vis the TT dollar are dominant contributors to the REER gap. The nominal exchange rate

2 The BOP data for 2015 was extensively revised in early 2016 by the CBTT to reflect (i) the incorporation of new data
on goods exports and imports from the Central Statistical Office (CSO), (ii) introduction of new data sources, and
(iii) correction of some large errors in the data. The large revisions in the BOP estimates will cause a structural break in
the data for 2015. Revisions to 2011-2014 BOP estimates, to make them comparable to 2015, and 2012 to 2014 IIP data
are anticipated by the third quarter of 2016. CARTAC’s technical assistance in 2015 and early 2016 has been instrumental
in these developments.

has been closely managed by the Central Bank of Trinidad and Tobago (CBTT) to stabilize the
currency against the US dollar, as its de facto nominal anchor.
4.
The authorities began to depreciate the TT dollar in November 2015 amid continued
widespread reports of foreign exchange (FX) shortages.3 The rate, which had been maintained
within a narrow range of +/- about 1 ½ percent around TT$6.35/US$1 since late 2009, was
depreciated by 3 ½ percent through early April
Exchange Rate
2016. The CBTT injected US$500 million to the

banks were requested “to ensure all legitimate

demands for FX are met (within a reasonable

time), with priority accorded to trade-related

transactions.”4 Nevertheless, reports of FX
6.40
shortages, including for current transactions,
6.35
soon reappeared. In the period since then
6.30
(November through March), the CBTT has
6.25
injected smaller amounts of foreign exchange,
averaging US$86 million per month. In April,
the government announced that the bilateral
rate versus the dollar would not be allowed to
depreciate more than 7 percent from its September 2015 level, leaving room for another 3.3 percent
depreciation from that date.
5.
Fiscal policies in recent years have been pro-cyclical. Despite high energy prices, the
budget remained in deficit, in part as non-energy tax bases were underutilized (or, regarding the
VAT, undermined with expanded zero-ratings). Expenditures increased as a share of GDP, with
transfers and subsidies (including for fuel) rising while capital spending has remained relatively flat.
Accordingly, despite the windfall gains in energy revenues, the government debt-to-GDP ratio
continued to rise while the assets of the Heritage and Stabilization Fund (HSF) grew only from 14 to
23 percent of GDP during FY2010-FY2015 (Table 2 and Figure 4), with only TT$4.5 billion of a
cumulative TT$19.2 billion of energy revenues in excess of budgeted amounts being transferred to
the HSF during 2010–14.5
6.
The 2014/15 fiscal accounts were hard hit by the decline in energy prices. The deficit
expanded to 4.7 percent of GDP, although it was contained from widening further by one-off
revenues. The budget deficit had been targeted at 3.1 percent of GDP (GFS basis), based on oil prices
The de facto exchange rate regime is official classified as a stabilized arrangement, but could be reclassified as
“crawl-like” if the current trend of depreciation continues through June of this year.

These calculations are based on the Fund’s definition of energy revenues, which is broader than that used by the
authorities in determining HSF financing, in that it includes, for example portions of personal income and corporate
profits taxes that are thought to be closely economically related to energy sector activity.

of US$80/barrel and (Henry hub) natural gas at US$2.75/mmBtu.6 However, energy-based revenues
fell short by 4.4 percentage points of budgeted GDP. While lower energy prices also reduced fuel
subsidies, by ¾ of a percentage point of GDP, expenditures were hit by the unbudgeted costs of a
multi-year public sector wage agreement. The authorities responded at mid-year with a “variance of
appropriations,” which sharply limited expenditures on other goods and services. Capital
expenditures of TT$7.2 billion also fell short of budget. Recourse was made to a number of “one-off”
revenue measures, notably greater reliance on dividend transfers from the National Gas Company
and an income tax amnesty that reportedly brought in an additional 0.3 percent of GDP in revenues.

7.
Despite the worse-than-budgeted fiscal outturn, the increase in government gross
indebtedness was limited by recourse to “one-off” financing. Asset sales, combined with an early
loan repayment by a state-owned enterprise (SOE), provided TT$4.8 billion (3 percent of GDP) in
financing, almost two-thirds of total requirements. The stock of arrears (especially for VAT refunds),
estimated in the 2016 budget statement at TT$5 billion, was also used to help with financing
difficulties. As a result, central government debt increased by only 2.0 percentage points of GDP,
while external debt actually fell in nominal terms to US$2.1 billion (8.4 percent of GDP).7
8.
The sharp fall in energy prices since the new government’s initial introduction of the
budget is leading the 2015/16 deficit to surge. With a seemingly conservative US$45/barrel oil
price assumption, the budget deficit was initially targeted at 7.5 percent of GDP on a GFS basis
(1.7 percent of GDP using the authorities’ accounting convention). 8 This was to be achieved through
adjustments totaling over 3 percent of GDP, including tight expenditure control, lower fuel subsidies
(in part through hikes in fuel prices), and revenue measures. Base broadening of the value-added tax
The authorities’ budget target was 2.3 percent of GDP. However, this included privatization revenues totaling
0.8 percentage points of GDP, which are included as financing on a GFS basis.

6

Continued excess domestic financial market liquidity required issuing additional short-term open-market-operation
instruments, which are not included in gross debt. The proceeds of such bonds are placed in “frozen” government
deposits, totaling 24 percent of GDP (end-September 2015).

The authorities count asset sales totaling some 6 percentage points of GDP as revenues, instead of “below-the-line”

(VAT), combined with a rate reduction (from 15 to 12½ percent), was expected to yield a net
2½ percentage points of GDP. The budget also continued to rely on above-average SOE dividends.
In addition, the government announced plans to use US$1 billion of HSF assets for deficit financing.
9.
As energy prices fell further and VAT revenues fell short, the authorities announced
additional measures in an April Mid-Year Budget Review (MYBR), aimed at containing further
fiscal erosion. Energy price assumptions were revised down to US$35 per barrel for oil and US$2.00
per mmBtu for natural gas. The measures included mid-year cuts of 7 percent of budgeted
expenditure, hikes in tobacco and alcohol excises and on excises and duties on large-engine
automobiles, further fuel subsidy savings from additional fuel price increases, and, with effect from
FY 2016/17, the introduction of a tax on internet purchases. However, even with these measures,
given lower energy prices and weaker-than-expected economic activity, staff estimates the deficit
could total almost 11 percent of GDP on a GFS basis.

began to taper off in 2015 (Figure 3). Median house prices remained relatively stable in 2015.
11.
Banks remain strong despite the weakening economic outlook. The latest indicators
(end-December, 2015) show no deterioration in asset quality, with non-performing loans (NPLs)
below 3½ percent. In addition, capitalization remains high and balance sheets very liquid, despite
recent reductions in excess reserves reflecting increased CBTT sales of FX.10 Though returns have
declined, banks remain profitable with ROA and ROE at 2.5 and 18.2 percent, respectively. The ratio
of specific provisions-to-impaired assets of 42.1 percent at end-December 2015 has been increasing,

but still falls well below the 79.2 percent five-year average prior to the global financial crisis (2003–
2007). Continued robust overall credit growth has been a source of risk for the overall health of the
financial sector, although the recent slowdown, in line with the slowing economy, has reduced this
risk (see Financial Soundness Indicator Map). Banks’ high liquidity and capital exceed prudential
norms by significant margins, and provide an ample buffer against any uptick in degradation of loan
quality, while CBTT stress tests show banks can withstand considerable levels of financial stress.11
Moreover, the banking system does not appear overly exposed to foreign exchange risk.
12.
Some financial reforms have stalled. Insurance legislation to improve regulatory oversight,
strengthen prudential requirements, and enhance governance was passed in the Senate, but lapsed
in the lower house. It is expected to be reintroduced in 2016. The Occupational Pensions Plan Act,
Credit Union Bill and amendments to the Co-operative Credit Societies Bill also await drafting or
reintroduction. Implementation of banking regulations to conform with Basel II, which began in 2014,
is proceeding, along with the National Financial Crisis Management Plan and the Systemically
Important Financial Institutions (SIFI) oversight project.

The windup of CL Financial Group (CLF) has progressed. A final resolution plan for
Colonial Life Insurance Company (Trinidad) Limited (CLICO) and British American Insurance Company
(Trinidad) Limited, including phased payments to CLICO’s policyholders and creditors from the
monetization of CLICO’s assets, was announced in March 2015. The government announced in April
2016 that CLICO’s shareholdings in MIHL, Angostura, Home Construction, and CL World Brands and
its traditional portfolio of insurance policies and other assets would be sold or disposed of in 2016,
with a view to repaying all legitimate creditors and policyholders in full. CLICO’s holdings in Republic
Bank are to be disposed of in 2017. A plan to monetize assets held directly by CLF is to be
announced in due course.
14.
The FX market has been experiencing long queues. Market participants reported a
worsening situation in the last 18–24 months, with a wait time for most requests of over four weeks
(and sometimes considerably longer) for their FX demand to be satisfied, including for making
payments and transfers for current international transactions. External payment arrears to creditors
have emerged, and some foreign suppliers have reportedly cut off credit lines to local importers.
15.
The CBTT’s intervention mechanism is targeted toward reducing market volatility, but
by itself has proven insufficient to address the underlying FX imbalance problems. The CBTT
manages the TT$ exchange rate mainly through its regulation of the maximum market sell and buy
rates, and through FX provision, accounting for approximately one-third of the total market FX
supply via discretionary, non-competitive allocations to licensed authorized dealers.12 The CBTT’s FX
supply has been insufficient to satisfy bona fide demand, including demand for current international
transactions at the exchange rate that is set within limits it determines. Recently, the CBTT increased
the frequency of its interventions to approximately every two weeks for better volatility
management, without increasing its total FX supply. The CBTT limits sales of its FX intervention funds
to meeting only “trade-related” demand, and has encouraged authorized dealers to similarly
prioritize sales of FX obtained from other sources.13
16.
Progress has been made in improving the business climate. The previous government
adopted a new bankruptcy and insolvency law, significantly shortened the time to start a business,
streamlined trade clearance procedures and simplified property registration. A public procurement
law was adopted, although the new government plans to reform it further. Efforts are now being
made to improve the insolvency framework, improve trade facilitation and access to credit, and
streamline company registration procedures. Government efforts to transition individuals from
“make-work” programs to the private sector have thus far largely failed, although the Government, in
Dealers’ maximum sell rate is set by applying a fixed margin over the intervention rate, which is the latest rate at
which the CBTT sells FX to authorized dealers. Dealers’ maximum buy rate is set at the mid-rate for the prior day. The
rates for the CBTT’s FX purchase from, and sale to, the government are set at the prior day’s mid-rate and the prior
day’s average sell rate, respectively.
12

“Trade related” transactions, however, do not include all current international transactions as defined under Article
XXX(d) of the IMF’s Articles of Agreement, and, accordingly, the priority sales do not cover payments and transfers for
other current, but non-foreign trade, international transactions, such as interest and net income payments, loan
amortization or direct investment depreciation payments, and family remittances.

While data shortcomings continue to constrain staff’s ability to conduct economic
surveillance, significant efforts are being made to remedy these shortcomings and
discrepancies across data sources. The quality and timeliness of key macro-economic indicators
had worsened in recent years due to insufficient attention and resources being provided in this area.
However, more recently, the government has begun to make a concerted effort to improve data
timeliness and quality. In particular, the new government has launched a process to transform the
Central Statistical Office (CSO) into an independent National Statistical Institute, to be launched at
the beginning of 2017 (Informational Annex).

MEDIUM-TERM OUTLOOK AND RISKS
18.
The economy is expected to shrink for a third year in 2016 given structural
impediments, now abetted by cyclical headwinds. Energy output will decline as natural gas, and
especially oil fields continue to be depleted, while the petrochemical sector has suffered plant
closures and gas shortages that constrain output. However, new gas fields should boost energy
production in 2017-2018. Non-energy growth is projected to decline in 2016 on spillovers from job
losses in the energy sector as well as the fiscal consolidation.14 These factors would continue to
weigh on activity until non-energy growth fully rebounds in 2018. Inflation should remain subdued
on weak activity.
19.
In staff’s baseline projections, with unchanged fiscal policies and current energy price
forecasts, the current account remains in deficit through the medium-term. Although exports
recover gradually, in line with energy prices and the new gas production, they remain well below
2014 levels, even by 2021. Slow implementation of supply side structural reforms and the overvalued
currency limit the potential for export diversification and growth. Import growth moderates in line
with an expected decline in FDI. The drawdown of the HSF and increased official financing are
insufficient to address the country’s financing requirement and the overall external position steadily
deteriorates to 3.3 months of imports by 2021.
20.
Under the baseline, the fiscal deficit rises to a range of 12½ to 13½ percent of GDP
over the medium term, resulting in an unsustainable debt buildup. The central government debt
to GDP ratio rises to nearly 80 percent of GDP by 2021, while the broader nonfinancial public sector
(NFPS) debt ratio rises to almost 100 percent. The Debt Sustainability Analysis’ (DSA) “Heat Map”
flashes red regarding the level of debt and gross financing needs, both in the baseline and under
various shocks, although this is mitigated by authorities’ strong policy commitment to enhancing
revenues and reducing and rationalizing public expenditures (Annex II). That said, the authorities’
ambitious target for revenue collection based on improvements to revenue administration may
14 Given the magnitude of the needed fiscal adjustment, staff’s projections took explicit account of negative multiplier
effects, assuming a 3-year impact with a maximum and cumulative impact of 0.3 and 0.6, respectively.

prove difficult to achieve, although there does appear to be ample scope for gains in this area. In
addition, the state-owned Petroleum Co. of Trinidad & Tobago (Petrotrin), which Moody’s
downgraded from Ba1 to Ba3 in April 2016, could represent a contingent liability to the
government.15

Risks to growth are tilted to the downside and much will depend on the authorities’
ability to navigate the transition to the lower energy price environment (Annex III). Given still
ample bank liquidity, monetary tightening’s impact on the non-energy economy will likely be
subdued, but may have a lagged effect. Absent sufficient exchange rate flexibility, renewed US dollar
appreciation against the currencies of Trinidad and Tobago’s trading partners would inhibit export
diversification, while failing to address FX shortages would restrain economic activity as businesses
are unable to make critical imports or pay suppliers in a timely manner. More worryingly, the
expected erosion in the reserves position, while already significant in staff’s baseline, could be
exacerbated if currency speculation or precautionary demand for U.S. dollars pick up, both of which
are much more likely should FX shortfalls persist. In the longer run, future energy investment will
depend not only on future expected energy prices, but on whether the investment regime is seen to
be appropriate to the new environment. Most critically, the government must demonstrate that its
medium-term strategy safeguards fiscal sustainability in order to maintain consumer and business
confidence. “De-risking”, as in other Caribbean countries, is becoming an area of concern for the

Moody’s estimated that support to state-owned enterprises could increase central government debt by 2 to
4.5 percent of GDP in 2016, the latter in the unlikely event that the government would need to guarantee all of

authorities, particularly for institutions with perceived high risk profiles, including private members
clubs and money remitters, though less so for the large commercial banks.

POLICY DISCUSSIONS
Fiscal Policy
22.
Given the need for sizable and sustained fiscal adjustment, staff encouraged the
authorities to formulate and announce early on a comprehensive multi-year adjustment
package. If sufficiently ambitious, this would signal the authorities’ commitment to fiscal
sustainability despite challenging circumstances. A measured pace of implementation will allow time
for rational policy formulation while spreading out the negative multiplier effects from contractionary
policies. Staff estimated that, in addition to measures included in the FY2016 budget plus the MYBR,
(which together total some 3 ½ percentage points of GDP), adjustments totaling 8 ½ percent of GDP
would keep the central government (NFPS) debt/GDP ratio at 48 (68) percent by 2021.
23.
Staff welcomed the initial non-energy revenue measures and the authorities’ intentions
to do more. The new budget included increases in business levies and a narrowing of the VAT’s
zero-rated bracket, albeit while reducing the rate from 15 to 12½ percent. The government

Division (CED). Staff agreed
these efforts would help in reducing undue reliance on energy-sector revenues. However, staff
advocated a more comprehensive VAT review to assess the scope for further base-broadening and
increased collection efficiency. Staff also advocated increasing excises on cigarettes, alcohol and soft
drinks, which would not only raise revenues, but could discourage consumption of products with
potentially adverse health outcomes. It also saw scope to further enhance property taxation, a
relatively non-distortionary revenue source.
24.
Staff welcomed the announced spending cuts of TT$ 4 billion (2.5 percent of GDP), but
urged a comprehensive review of expenditure programs to best achieve the government’s
economic and social policy goals within tightened financial constraints. Particular attention

should be focused on reviewing “make-work” programs (the CEPEP and URP), given the widespread
view that they are undermining incentives in the private labor market, although due regard should
be given to social concerns. The government’s free tertiary tuition program (GATE) could be made
more cost-efficient, including by means-testing and tightening eligibility requirements. Staff also
continued to urge the phasing out of fuel subsidies, noting their inefficiencies, deleterious side
effects (pollution and congestion) and inequitable benefits (Box 1). Transfers to state-owned
enterprises and statutory authorities also represent an important burden and could be reduced if
commercial enterprises were run on a more profitable basis, including through pricing policies that
allow for greater cost-recovery. Finally, staff advocated that revenue increases and cuts to current
expenditure should be large enough to allow for an increase in growth-enhancing public investment.

Box 1. The Impacts of Fuel Subsidies in Trinidad and Tobago1
Energy subsidies in Trinidad and Tobago, established in
1974, increased dramatically during the period of rising
global crude oil prices, stimulating a debate on the costs
and benefits of subsidy reforms. From 2006-15, cumulative
fuel subsidies amounted to TT$31 billion, or an average of
around 2 percent of GDP per annum. Total subsidies and
global crude oil prices are strongly positively correlated. As oil
prices trended up between 2009 and 2014, fuel subsidies rose
to 2.3 percent of GDP. As crude oil prices plummeted in 2015,
subsidies dropped to 1.4 percent of GDP.

Fuel subsidies have imposed a significant fiscal cost.
Initially, a Petroleum Production Levy (PPL) was imposed on petroleum producers to pay the difference
between the international and domestic prices of fuels. During 1974-1992, the PPL covered the entire value
of the subsidy. However, an amendment in 1992 constrained the levy to 3 percent of producers’ gross
income (although it was increased to 4 percent in 2003, where it still stands). Moreover, in 2003 businesses
that produced less than 3,500 barrels of oil per day were exempted from the levy. Thus, an increasing share

Fuel Subsidy (Government Liability)

The resources spent on fuel subsidies have significantly
contributed to procyclicality and might better have
been saved in the HSF.2 The fiscal contribution to the HSF
has been declining since the global financial crisis while until
recently the cost of the fuel subsidy was trending upward,
driven by rising oil prices. Had the government contributed
the amount spent on fuel subsidies since 2008 to the HSF
instead, the Fund would now be worth an additional US$3.6
billion, 62 percent higher than where it currently stands.
There is strong evidence that fuel subsidies
disproportionately benefit higher income people.
According to CSSP (2014) and Chester (2015), low income
earners, accounting for 50 percent of the population in
2014, gained only 27 percent of total fuel subsidies
compared to 36 percent for the richest 15 percent of
households. The average monthly subsidy for the richest
households was 95 and 68 percent higher than for low and
middle income households, respectively.

driven by the negative externality from natural gas and

post-tax subsidies, or around US$2.1 billion, in Trinidad and Tobago in 2015. Pre-tax subsidies account for
US$0.8 billion, vehicle externalities for another US$0.6 billion, local air pollution for US$0.3 billion and
foregone consumption tax revenues for US$0.2 billion (0.9 percent of GDP).

Box 1. The Impacts of Fuel Subsidies in Trinidad and Tobago (Concluded)
Trinidad and Tobago is one of the top subsidizers for vehicle-related externalities in the world.4 The
total cost of the traffic externality amounts to US$598 million in 2015. This amounts to an annual per capita
traffic externality cost of US$441, placing the country among the top 12 subsidizers in the world. Moreover,
the estimate is based on regional averages, and is quite likely a large underestimate of congestion costs,
given the much higher incidence of automobile ownership in Trinidad and Tobago.

The saving (withdrawal) rule of the HSF is triggered when actual energy revenue exceeds (falls below) budgeted
revenue by at least 10 percent. Contributions, however, are mandatory, whereas withdrawals are discretionary.
Post-tax subsidies arise when the price paid by consumers is below the supply cost of energy plus an appropriate
“Pigouvian” (or “corrective”) tax that would reflect the negative externalities associated with energy consumption
and an additional consumption tax that should be applied to all consumption goods (i.e., the value added tax).

Vehicle-related externalities include traffic congestion, accidents, and road damage caused by the additional
usage of vehicles due to fuel subsidies.

Staff presented the case for adopting a countercyclical fiscal rule, while cautioning
there is no fiscal space for such a countercyclical rule now given the projected size of deficits
under the baseline. However, once the country has adjusted to the current economic and fiscal
stress, which will require a multi-year adjustment, a fiscal rule could be adopted to ensure that fiscal
policy in the future supports the twin goals of debt sustainability while still playing a stabilizing,
countercyclical role (Box 2).16

In downgrading Trinidad and Tobago’s sovereign debt rating in April 2015 to Baa2 from Baa1 and again in April
2016 to Baa3 (negative outlook), Moody’s cited, in addition to persistent deficits and challenging prospects for fiscal
reform among lower energy prices, the absence of a medium-term fiscal strategy.

Box 2. A Fiscal Rule for Trinidad and Tobago
As an energy dependent economy,
Trinidad and Tobago has experienced
large swings in national wealth. While
its sizable endowment of oil and gas
improves national welfare, heavy
dependence on energy means that large
swings in the value of the country’s
resources complicate fiscal policy
formulation. The sharp drop in energy
prices since 2014 represents a measurable
drop in the nation’s net worth.

instance, the country ran fiscal deficits
even as oil prices rose dramatically from early 2011, with oil prices above US$80 per barrel through mid2014. The fiscal deficits were expansionary even as the energy price boom was already pouring additional
financial resources into both the public and private sectors of the economy. The deficits increased
government debt and led to only moderate increases in Heritage and Stabilization Fund, a sovereign wealth
fund (SWF). Going back further, Trinidad and Tobago’s fiscal history shows that booms in energy revenue
have been associated with significant worsening of the non-energy fiscal balance, as increasing energy
revenues were spent on non-energy expenditures.
Once the situation permits, the
authorities should look to adopt a multiyear fiscal rule that will help to stabilize
economic activity while saving
adequately for future generations. Given
the size of the current fiscal gap, policies in
the coming years will, by necessity, require
pro-cyclical fiscal consolidation to stabilize
the debt position.

complexity. There are four types of fiscal rules: budget balance rules, debt rules, expenditure rules, and
revenue rules. Debt rules by definition are more effective than other types of rules in promoting debt
sustainability; however, they are not binding when debt is well below the limit. On the other hand, while
cyclically-adjusted rules can work the best to temper the impact of economic fluctuations, they require
substantial institutional and forecast capacity to implement.

Given high revenue volatility and limited forecasting capacity, Trinidad and Tobago could consider a
rule that targets the non-energy primary balance, supplemented by a rule covering nominal primary
expenditure. Such a combination has a number of virtues. It would be simple and transparent, and
appropriate to the country’s current institutional capacity. Targeting the non-energy primary balance would
help ensure convergence of the debt ratio, while a primary expenditure rule would insulate expenditures
from volatile energy revenues and help ensure the buildup of sufficient buffers in good times.1

___________________________
While an SWF can be useful to help save commodity revenues, it is not necessarily, by itself, adequate to prevent overspending in good times.

1

Authorities’ views
26.
The authorities concurred that the size of adjustment needed would require a
substantial multi-year effort. The government intends to implement property and gaming taxes
and agreed to give serious consideration to raising excise taxes by bringing rates more in line with
regional levels, an effort that was announced, as noted, in the MYBR with increased excises on
alcohol and tobacco. The government is also placing a lot of emphasis on improved revenue
administration, and believes that pursuing greater information sharing among revenue generating
agencies, tightening rules on transfer pricing, and increasing resources devoted to tax enforcement
will, over time, substantially increase revenue yields. Energy taxes may also need to be revisited in
light of lower energy prices, with the dual goals of continuing to incentivize new investment while
safeguarding public revenues.
27.
The authorities agreed on the need to rein in expenditures, especially transfers and
subsidies. They agreed to seek a comprehensive review of social expenditures from the World Bank
both to reduce costs and improve program efficiency, while still providing a social safety net to
protect the most vulnerable citizens. The authorities also agreed on the need to remove fuel
subsidies, and announced their intention to do so in a phased manner in the MYBR, using the
savings to improve the social safety net and reduce transportation costs for low-income groups.

16

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

TRINIDAD AND TOBAGO

They intend to propose a new pricing mechanism for public discussion that would henceforth pass
through world oil price changes to local fuel prices. The authorities also intend to review a number of
specific programs, especially CEPEP and URP, with a view to achieving cost efficiencies. Finally, the
authorities acknowledged that it will be important to clear expenditure arrears, which will likely
require recourse to domestic financing.
28.
The authorities emphasized efforts to enhance transparency and consult the private
sector, aimed at seeking buy-in for the fiscal consolidation required to adjust to new
circumstances. The authorities inaugurated a National Tripartite Advisory Council with
representatives from labor, businesses and government, to find ways to share the sacrifices required
for medium-term stability. Separately, they have commenced a national discussion on energy
subsidies and are starting discussions with the energy industry on reforming energy taxes.

Monetary and Exchange Rate Policy
29.
Staff supported the pause in monetary policy tightening as appropriate given the
headwinds to growth. This will give time to assess the lagged impact of tightening already in the
pipeline and to gain greater clarity on the pace of the U.S. hiking cycle. Staff argued the CBTT is not
currently in a position to ease policy until confidence is restored in the FX market. In fact, should FX
pressures increase or inflation expectations rise, the CBTT may need to resume policy tightening. It
will also need to carefully monitor and manage excess liquidity in the banking system, which has
declined significantly due to appropriate sterilization operations by the CBTT. Contingent on a
credible fiscal consolidation, a restoration of confidence in the FX market, and sufficient exchange
rate flexibility, it may be possible in the future to implement more accommodative monetary policy
to support economic activity, provided also that inflation and inflation-expectations remain “wellbehaved”. Similarly, as financial system liquidity is unwound, the CBTT could consider reducing bank
reserve requirements, which are comparatively high, at 17 percent. More broadly, staff recommended
that the authorities make clearer the CBTT’s priorities among its multiple mandated objectives.
30.
In staff’s view, pressures in the FX market have arisen for a variety of reasons,
including both significant changes in underlying fundamentals and incentives that have set in
motion adverse expectations dynamics. Most obviously, the fall in energy prices has served to
sharply diminish the supply of FX to the market. However, expansionary fiscal policies and growth in
consumer credit have also contributed to demand. Importantly, expectations appeared to be playing
a significant role in amplifying FX demand pressures for two reasons. First, ongoing shortages have
led to strong incentives to hoard FX for precautionary reasons when it does become available.
Second, the lack of flexibility in the nominal exchange rate (vis-à-vis the US dollar) has led to
increasing expectations that the exchange rate cannot hold, leading to speculative outflows aimed at
taking advantage of a weakening currency. In the MYBR, the Finance Minister attempted to quell
such speculative pressures by announcing that the exchange rate would not deviate “at this time” by
more than 7 percent from the rate that prevailed in September 2015, meaning that a floor on the
rate would be set at a further 3.3 percent depreciation from the April 8, 2016 rate (the date of the
MYBR).

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

17

TRINIDAD AND TOBAGO

31.
Exchange rate policy needs to take into account both the impact on market
expectations, and the major fiscal and external adjustments needed in the face of the sharp
declines in energy prices. The recent depreciation is welcome as it should provide some incentive
to favor switching expenditure towards domestic goods from foreign goods (both by residents and
foreigners). However, it remains to be seen whether depreciation, even to the new exchange rate
floor, is sufficient to bring the market into greater balance given the degree of estimated currency
overvaluation.
32.
If not, one option would be to pursue a substantial depreciation to a level more
commensurate with balancing FX demand and supply, and then allow the currency to
fluctuate within a fairly wide band. This could still give the market some flexibility to provide
signals about fundamental pressures, while helping expectations to coalesce around a given rate and
introducing two-way market risk so as to minimize speculation about further depreciation. At the
same time, the high level of external buffers, in the form of FX reserves and a still substantial HSF,
affords the authorities a range of options.17
33.
Any changes to the exchange rate regime should be introduced as part of a broader
fiscal and structural reform package. Keeping the benefits of a weaker currency from being
eroded through inflation would require a firmly-implemented incomes policy, as well as monetary
policy that is alert to second-round effects of the currency move. In addition, clear communications
about the reasons for such reforms, and to clarify the “rules of the game” regarding how the FX
regime will be operated in the future, would be critical to restoring market confidence. Staff also
pointed to the fiscal benefits, as a currency depreciation would allow for a smaller active fiscal
adjustment (as revenues in foreign exchange are converted into larger amounts of local currency),
and thus have a less adverse impact on growth.
34.
Staff noted that private sector market participants continued to confirm queues for
FX, including for current international transactions, notwithstanding official reserves
equivalent to over 13 months of imports. Staff acknowledged that the issue has been longstanding, although it became exacerbated as queues have become relatively long and external
payment arrears have emerged, most likely starting in late 2014 as the impact of the fall in energy
prices began to flow through to the FX market. Queues now appear to be of macroeconomic
significance, due to the significant delays in obtaining FX for current imports and for debt servicing.18
35.
Trinidad and Tobago’s current exchange rate regime gives rise to an exchange
restriction and two multiple currency practices subject to Fund approval. The exchange
Any exchange rate change would need to take due account of any balance sheet impacts, on which data is limited,
though CBTT stress tests indicate the banking system’s capital positions would easily withstand an illustrative
40 percent depreciation in the TT dollar. A 2011 survey of the country’s international investment position (the only
one ever undertaken) showed the country with a net foreign asset position.
17

18 As was noted in the 2014 Article IV Staff Report, “a failure to introduce greater flexibility into the foreign exchange
market could lead to renewed shortages, indicating the existence of an exchange restriction.”

18

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

TRINIDAD AND TOBAGO

restriction arises from the authorities’ restriction of the exchange rate (i.e., fixing the exchange rate
and prohibiting banks from trading at any rate depreciated from this fixed rate), while not providing
enough foreign exchange to meet all demand for current transactions at that rate, leading to undue
delays and external payment arrears. The multiple currency practices arise due to the absence of a
mechanism to prevent more than a two percent deviation at any given time among several multiple
effective rates for spot exchange transactions, which are also regulated by the authorities.
Authorities’ views
36.
The authorities explained that while the CBTT has multiple objectives, monetary
policy was primarily aimed at controlling inflation. Concerns about potential interest rate
differentials vis à vis the United States, seen as an important driver of capital flows, were also a
motivating factor behind interest rate hikes. At the same time, domestic rates had now been raised
to a sufficiently high level that there was some space to hold rates to avoid creating disincentives for
investment.
37.
The CBTT felt their exchange rate policy was clearly understood, was aimed at
minimizing volatility, and would be guided by the presumption that the terms of trade shock
is permanent. They agreed that the exchange rate had a role to play in balancing supply and
demand for FX, and that the rate would eventually find its level. Official intervention in the FX market
would continue to take place via biweekly auctions, and the rate and volumes at each intervention
would be informed by economic conditions at the time, particularly anticipated FX inflows and
outflows. The central bank would not try to equilibrate the market at each point in time, given that
this would lead to either an undesirably large loss of reserves or a high degree of volatility in the
exchange rate, given the need to adjust to the major terms-of-trade shock.
Structural Policies
38.
Staff welcomed the authorities’ efforts to improve the business climate and urged
them to sustain these efforts to help achieve long overdue economic diversification.19 Despite
repeated efforts at diversification, there has been little success since 2000, when the development of
the LNG industry started to increase the country’s dependence on global energy markets. To date,
cumbersome regulations and administrative procedures and land scarcity are among the main
concerns about starting a business.20 Reforming government “make-work” programs to make them
less distortionary would raise labor productivity and in the long run, social welfare. Staff continued to
emphasize the need for reforms to make the public service more efficient, notably to increase the
flexibility of employment decisions so that staff can be allocated to their best uses and strong
performance is rewarded. In this regard, staff welcomed the new administration’s significant
Trinidad and Tobago’s encouraging diversification process during 1983–1999 has stalled since 2000 as the rapid
growth of the liquefied natural gas (LNG) industry crowded out manufacturing as well as other non-energy sectors.

reduction in the number of government ministries, which sends an important signal about
streamlining the public service.
39.
Staff noted the need for fiscal structural reforms. A unified revenue authority, which the
present government would like eventually to establish, could be one mechanism that would greatly
improve the information flow between the BIR and CED. Staff called for delivering advance tax
rulings promptly, since significant delays in such rulings are reportedly holding back investment
decisions. The planned formation of a tax policy unit, with the help of technical assistance from the
Fund, would greatly facilitate this. Staff commended the authorities for their improvements in debt
monitoring, and urged that the next step now be taken, with the system being used to enhance debt
management.
40.
Staff urged the authorities to move forward on long-pending legislation for improving
insurance supervision. This should be followed by legislation to improve supervision of credit
unions, undertake occupational pension reform and address key AML/CFT shortcomings arising from
the recently conducted Caribbean Financial Action Task Force (CFATF) evaluation (including ensuring
robust AML/CFT supervision and publication of the national risk assessment). Finally, it is hoped that
the long-standing issues related to CL Financial may be resolved relatively soon, both to provide
clarity to markets and to eliminate any residual claims against, and uncertainty about, the
government’s finances.
41.
Staff strongly endorses the process to establish a renewed data institution, through the
establishment of an independent and autonomous National Statistical Institute (NSI). The task
force to establish this has made significant headway in a short amount of time, and staff welcomes
the intention to pass legislation this year to establish the NSI. In the meantime, the CSO has already
reduced data backlogs, particularly in trade statistics. Per CARTAC suggestions, the CSO also has a
plan to produce quarterly GDP statistics and update the Producer Price Index (PPI), although the
timeline will depend on the availability of staff resources.
Authorities’ views
42.
The authorities concurred on the need for further structural reforms, made more
urgent in light of energy price declines. Important financial legislation, including the long-delayed
Insurance Bill, procurement reforms, and gaming legislation, are immediate priorities. The
government is pressing ahead with creation of a tax policy unit and hopes, at some point, to find
political support for establishing the unified revenue authority. The need to establish a renewed,
vigorous independent data institution also remains a critical priority, although fully rebuilding
capacity to achieve best practice will take some time.

STAFF APPRAISAL
43.
In recent years, Trinidad and Tobago has under-saved and under-invested in its
future given the size of energy revenue windfalls, with the consequence that there is currently
no scope to pursue countercyclical policy. Even current low debt levels and substantial financial
cushions are insufficient to withstand the size of the terms of trade shock that now needs to be

20

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

TRINIDAD AND TOBAGO

confronted. If ignored (and barring an unexpected sharp rebound of energy prices), the imbalances
that are now starting to build could lead the country to uncomfortable levels of debt and external
financial cushions in a few short years. In turn, that could necessitate a very rapid pace of adjustment,
with the attendant severe dislocations and associated deflationary consequences.
44.
The new government has made a strong start on the difficult fiscal adjustments
needed to bring the economy back into balance. They introduced new revenue measures with the
FY 2015/16 budget, and introduced further adjustment measures mid-year when it became clear that
even the seemingly conservative energy price assumptions in the budget were being outpaced by
events. While these measures have been in the right direction, staff believes it will be important to
provide a strong medium-term framework to guide an overall multi-year adjustment effort. While it
would be neither possible nor advisable at this time to try to fully spell out all the measures required,
the government should work towards a broad set of medium-term fiscal goals, backed by quantified
estimates of measures where feasible, while leaving some scope to adjust the size of the adjustment
as the situation unfolds. At the same time, the government should spell out broad intentions in areas
where reforms will be desirable, regardless of how the economy evolves. In this regard, the
government’s intention to pursue a comprehensive expenditure review is welcome, as are the
intentions to review government “make-work” programs and the GATE program. More broadly, staff
welcomes the government’s intention to develop a medium-term macroeconomic programming
capacity, as well as a tax policy unit, with the help of Fund technical assistance. In addition, staff
believes that once the fiscal path is back on track, a fiscal rule could help avoid the pro-cyclicality
that has characterized economic management for decades.
45.
Monetary and exchange rate policy can work to support economic activity once
confidence in the government’s medium-term strategy is established. For now, both monetary
and exchange rate policy will need to be primarily oriented towards external balance. This will
especially require giving confidence to the private sector that FX will be available on demand for
legitimate current transactions. In turn, this will require both fundamental measures to restore
underlying balance in the supply and demand for FX, while also undertaking confidence-building
measures to reduce the adverse impact that expectations are currently having in exacerbating the
demand for FX. In this sense, while the country has options, a depreciation that helps switch
expenditures towards domestic activity and reduces current expectations that have been giving the
market a one-way bet on the currency, could actually serve to stabilize the market. However, it would
be essential to introduce any significant change to the exchange rate regime as part of a
comprehensive package of demand management and growth-enhancing reforms, accompanied by a
clear communications strategy that guides the private sector to a new equilibrium.
46.
Staff does not recommend Executive Board approval of the retention of the measures
giving rise to the exchange restriction and multiple currency practices described in paragraph
35 above since there is no clear plan and timetable to eliminate these measures, and for measures
giving rise to the exchange restriction, since they are also not maintained for balance of payments
reasons.
47.
With regards to structural reforms, the new government is building on some of the
achievements of the previous government, and also introducing welcome new priorities. Early

successes in passing critical legislation on insurance supervision and the new NSI, while progressing
on a tax policy unit, could constitute an effective initial package of structural reforms. In addition,
early commencement of an effort to design reforms in the areas of government “make-work”
programs, GATE and in particular, to kick-start an effort to diagnose the reasons for inefficiencies in
the public sector would go a long way towards establishing the government’s reformist bona fides.

Annex I. External Stability Assessment
Trinidad and Tobago’s external position in 2015 is assessed to be substantially weaker than the level
consistent with medium-term fundamentals and desirable policy settings. Much of the deterioration is
due to the large terms of trade shock from the decline in energy prices. Policy responses have been
insufficient to address the scale of the shock. A more flexible exchange rate, fiscal consolidation and
structural reforms would be desirable policy changes over the medium term to improve the current
account position, stabilize or secure reserve buffers and improve competitiveness and prospects for
export diversification. Reserves are assessed to be adequate and sufficient to absorb most shocks.
1.
The Trinidad and Tobago economy is highly dependent on the energy sector. Energy
output accounts for about 45 percent of GDP, contributes 55 percent of government revenues and
82 percent of merchandise exports. The decline in oil prices and higher imports of capital and
consumer goods reduced Trinidad and Tobago’s current account to a deficit of 5.4 percent of GDP in
2015 from a 4.6 percent of GDP surplus the previous year.1 Given the forecast for continued low oil
prices, the REER appreciation and a no-policy change scenario, the current account would remain in
a deficit position in the medium term. Notwithstanding high foreign exchange reserves, staff
estimates that the external position would weaken over the medium term and growth would remain
sub-optimal. A more flexible exchange rate policy would allow the exchange rate to adjust to the
terms of trade shock, smooth volatility in the market as well as improve price competitiveness. Fiscal
consolidation aiming for a small primary deficit over the medium term while providing space for
infrastructure spending to ease supply bottlenecks would improve the current account position and
help stabilize reserves. Supportive structural reforms over the medium term are also needed to boost
productivity, improve competitiveness and prospects for export diversification away from the energy
sector (see Annex IV).
Current Account
Current Account and Real Exchange Rate Assessments

2.
The EBA-lite models suggest the cyclicallyadjusted current account gap to be -5.6 to -7.6
percent of GDP away from the level consistent
with medium term fundamentals and desirable
policy settings in 2015. Macroeconomic policies
contributed -2.3 percent of GDP to the gap, much of
this reflects the fiscal policy gap relative to other
countries (-2.7 percent of GDP).

1 The BOP data for 2015 was extensively revised in early 2016 by the Central Bank of Trinidad and Tobago (CBTT) to
reflect (i) the incorporation of new data on goods exports and imports from the Central Statistical Office (CSO),
(ii) introduction of new data sources, and (iii) correction of some large errors in the data. The large revisions in the
BOP estimates will cause a structural break in the data for 2015. Revisions to 2011 to 2014 BOP estimates, to make it
comparable to 2015, and 2012 to 2014 IIP data are anticipated by the third quarter of 2016. CARTAC’s technical
assistance in 2015 and early 2016 has been instrumental in these developments.

Assessment of Reserve Adequacy
4.
At US$9.79 billion (13.6 months import
cover), Trinidad and Tobago’s net official foreign
reserves exceed by a wide margin typical
benchmarks of reserve adequacy, such as 3 months
of imports of goods and services, 20 percent of
broad money, and short-term debt falling due
within one year. The reserve level also exceeds the
IMF’s composite reserve adequacy (ARA) metric for
fixed exchange rate regimes,2 and the metric for smallisland developing states (SIDs).3 Under a baseline
scenario of lower oil and gas prices combined with nopolicy changes, staff project a shift from current
account surpluses to modest deficits and higher capital

2 A recent MCM Technical Assistance mission suggests the RPI is likely significantly overstated due to an
overestimation of inflation of the volatile food component of the index. They point out that food price inflation
averaging 14 percent since 2005 is almost certainly incompatible with average core inflation of less than 3 percent
over the same period.

Although TTO’s exchange rate is classified as a stabilized arrangement, there are only two ARA metrics, one for
floating and one for fixed. The latter is applied to all exchange rate arrangements other than floating and freely
floating, including those classified as a stabilized arrangement. The metric is: .30*short-term debt + .20*other
liabilities + .10*broad money + .10*exports of goods.

outflows in coming years. Foreign exchange reserve levels are expected to decline to 3.3 months of
import cover by 2021. The rate of decline in reserves would be faster should speculative demand for
foreign currency exacerbate outflows.
5.
A more flexible exchange rate policy would allow the exchange rate to adjust to the
terms of trade shock, smooth volatility in the market as well as improve price competitiveness
and prospects for export diversification. Fiscal consolidation supported by structural reforms
would also improve the external position and address economic imbalances over the medium term.

Annex II. Debt Sustainability Analysis
Under current policies and projected energy prices, Trinidad and Tobago’s central government debt is
set to rise unsustainably. While sizable buffers do exist, and can be used to finance a coherent package
of medium-term adjustment, they cannot substitute for them. Although the long-term profile, and
relatively low foreign share of outstanding debt reduce risks, sustainability pressures would be
exacerbated by slower growth, a worsened primary balance, and especially by further debt servicing
burdens imposed by an additional fall in energy prices. Trinidad and Tobago’s external debt is at low
levels and is projected to increase over the medium term to moderate but sustainable levels. However,
the debt is very sensitive to exchange rate shocks.
1.
Despite elevated energy prices during 2010-2014, government debt continued to rise.1
While part of this reflected the costs of cleaning up the CLICO financial group’s collapse, pro-cyclical
fiscal policies also prevented a further improvement in the public’s balance sheet. Following the
latest sizable drop in energy prices, and only limited prospects for their rebound over the projection
period, absent significant additional adjustment the central government’s debt ratio is projected to
rise unsustainably in future years. While the authorities have sizable asset buffers that they can
employ over the short term, including Heritage and Stabilization (HSF) sovereign wealth assets in
excess of 20 percent of GDP, and “frozen” government deposits totaling an additional 20 percent of
GDP, these would soon be exhausted by deficits projected to remain in excess of 10 percent of GDP
under the baseline scenario.2
2.
The heat map clearly flags the high risks to debt sustainability under the current (nonadjustment) baseline scenario. Despite recourse to “one-off” financing sources totaling almost
13 percent of GDP in fiscal years 2016-17 (including from privatization revenues, collection of “above
average” dividends and early loan repayments by SOEs, and a partial rundown in HSF assets), the
debt ratio is set to almost triple, to 78 percent of GDP by 2021. Only the debt profile aspect of the
The DSA applies to the central government debt, which excludes short-term debt issued for open market monetary
policy purposes. These instruments were equivalent to 20 percent of GDP at the end of the 2015 fiscal year, and were
matched by corresponding “frozen” government deposits in the domestic banking system. The remainder of the
central government debt is of a longer-term (more than one year’s maturity) nature. The debt concept considered
here is also narrower than the nonfinancial sector public (NFPS) debt which, in addition to central government debt,
includes the government’s contingent liabilities arising from current or soon-to-be guaranteed debt of public
statutory authorities and state-owned enterprises. While central government debt totaled 27.4 percent of GDP at the
end of FY2015, NFPS debt was equivalent to 44.2 percent of GDP. Although these contingent government liabilities
have not been called in recent years, current pressures resulting from lower energy prices may require government
support. In addition, the government also has potentially large contingent liabilities arising from guaranteed pensions
from the National Pension Scheme. As discussed in the last Staff Report (IMF Country Report 14/271, p. 19), prior to
recent parametric reforms to the pension scheme, IMF staff projected growing annual shortfalls in pension financing
totaling about 3½ percent of GDP annually by 2060, with a cumulative net negative asset position equivalent to 87
percent of GDP.

1

The authorities are making use of “one-off” financing measures to limit debt accumulation in the current and next
fiscal years (which are included as “residual” financing, totaling 10.7 percent of GDP in FY2016 and 2.1 percent in
FY2017). These include liquidating US$1 billion of Heritage and Stabilization Fund assets in the current fiscal year and
potentially US$500 million in the next fiscal year (4.3, and 2.1 of GDP, respectively). In addition, privatization revenues
totaling 6.4 percent of GDP are included in the current fiscal year.
2

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

TRINIDAD AND TOBAGO

assessment is not breached under the baseline assessment, as the assumed 1/3 foreign debt
financing assumption, similar to the current share, continues to keep the total debt held by
nonresidents at a moderate share of GDP. However, the recent (April 15) downgrade by Moody’s of
Trinidad and Tobago’s sovereign debt rating to Baa3 leaves the country only one notch above subinvestment grade, and the rating carries a negative outlook. A downgrade to a sub-investment grade
rating would likely have an adverse impact on the country’s sovereign bond spread.
3.
On balance there appears to be no sizable systematic bias in the baseline assumptions,
although recent real GDP growth projections were in retrospect optimistic. Ongoing energy
sector maintenance has resulted in weaker-than-expected economic growth. Given the large share of
energy-based fiscal revenue sources, this has similarly led to a general overestimation of the primary
fiscal balance, while, in contrast, and with the exception of the energy-price collapse related dip in
2009, inflation appears to have been slightly underestimated (although this is likely related to
statistical shortcomings—see the discussion in the Informational Annex).
4.
Given the already unsustainable nature of the debt projections, macroeconomic stress
tests confirming this conclusion are not unexpected. Negative shocks to growth and the primary
balance worsen the debt outlook. And with nominal growth and interest rates initially rather close,
the debt projections are quite sensitive to interest rate shocks, although the magnitude of the shock
is very large—the result of the sensitivity of the GDP deflator, and hence the real rate, to volatile
energy prices.3
5.
Given the largely static nature of the projected primary balance, there is little
difference to the projections were it to remain precisely constant—in sharp contrast to the
debt reducing effects of a return to its historical norm. This makes starkly clear the need for
sizable additional fiscal adjustment—on the order of an additional 8 ½ percentage points of GDP on
top of the 3.6 percent of measures already adopted in the current fiscal year.

External Debt Sustainability
6. Trinidad and Tobago’s external debt-to-GDP ratio has increased in recent years but is at a
low level. As a share of GDP, external debt was 12.2 percent at end-2015, up from a low of around
8.9 percent at end 2011 (Figure 1 and Table 1). The main reason for the increase has been a rise in
general government borrowing through internationally issued bonds.
7. External debt is projected to increase in the medium term. Under the baseline, external debt
would continue to steadily rise to 22.8 percent of GDP at end-2020 before stabilizing as government
financing needs abate. External debt may increase above the current baseline if the government

3 The large share of Trinidad and Tobago’s energy sector and recent large swings in energy prices, have resulted in a
very volatile path for the GDP deflator, with the latter increasing by 21.3 percent in 2008, thereby contributing to a
42.9 percent effective real interest rate in that year, followed by a 16.6 percent decline in the deflator in 2009. Even
excluding this outlier, the volatile nature of the deflator raises the effective interest rate shock by 9 percentage points
in 2021, with obviously deleterious implications for fiscal sustainability.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

37

TRINIDAD AND TOBAGO

increases reliance on external financing (including multilateral loans) to help fund infrastructure
projects.
8. External sustainability is robust to interest rate and GDP shocks, but is more sensitive to
current account and exchange rate shocks (Figure 1). A 30 percent real depreciation in 2017 would
almost double the external debt to GDP ratio to about 24½ percent in 2017 and it would peak at
34½ percent in 2019 before subsiding. A further deterioration in the current account balance from
the current level would have the largest impact—a ½ standard deviation shock would introduce debt
dynamics such that the external debt to GDP ratio reaches 56 percent by 2021 and increases beyond
the 5-year projection period. However, an adverse shock of this size would almost certainly require a
significant (in U.S. dollar terms) drop in energy prices from their already current low levels.

Main Threats

Likelihood of Realization of
Threat

Expected Impact if Threat is
Realized

Persistently lower
energy prices
triggered by supply
factors reversing only
gradually, and
weaker demand.

MEDIUM

VERY HIGH

Although energy price
projections have recently been
revised much lower, they still
reflect a more than 50 percent
rebound over the medium
term for oil prices, while
natural gas prices are
projected to rebound
modestly. Given the current
level of extreme uncertainties
in energy markets, much lower
price paths could be
considered.



Trinidad and Tobago’s economy
will remain heavily dependent
on the energy sector for the
foreseeable future.



Thus, continued low oil prices
and further declines in natural
gas prices would have a yet
more deleterious impact on
fiscal prospects, and might also
lead to persistent, and larger
current account deficits.



In the short term, the economy
is protected by substantial
financial cushions, including 13
months of import cover in
external reserves (end-2015)
plus the Heritage and
Stabilization Fund’s (HSF) net
assets, equivalent to nearly
25 percent of GDP. However,
continued uncertainty about
future energy prices could lead
to a fall in energy-related
foreign direct investment,
which, if combined with
persistent current account
deficits, could erode those
cushions, particularly if a loss of
confidence in the authorities’
ability to manage the situation
were to lead to rapid capital
outflows. The fall in energy
prices, especially if sustained,
could also damage consumer
and business confidence that
leads to serious spillovers to the
non-energy sector.

Policies to Ameliorate Threat



Over the medium term, the focus
needs to be on diversifying the
country’s non-energy economic
base by public investment and
structural reforms.

 In addition, tax reforms to reduce
dependence on energy sector
revenues and expenditure reform
to contain public consumption
will be critical to making public
finances more resilient to
persistently lower energy prices.
 The authorities are intending to
draw on the HSF for US$1$1.5 billion in fiscal financing.
While this is acceptable given the
size of the terms of trade shock
(as long as it serves as a bridge
to durable fiscal adjustments), it
reduces the remaining fiscal
cushions, and any further such
drawdowns should be explicit in
their objective, and strictly
limited in size and duration.

HIGH

MEDIUM
 With energy prices already low,
should the authorities continue
to allow only modest
depreciation vis-à-vis the U.S.
dollar, depreciating persistent
dollar strength would work
against the authorities’ efforts
to diversify the economy.
 Over the medium-term,
continued sluggish growth
would raise further challenges
with respect to debt
sustainability and improving
income distribution and social
outcomes.

Failure to address
foreign exchange
(FX) shortages.

 The authorities should give
consideration to a more
substantial depreciation that
would help unwind some of the
currency overvaluation, which
derives in part from linking to the
U.S. dollar. Widening the
exchange rate band, and
eventually adopting an
alternative monetary framework
to anchor on price stability would
afford better insulation against
terms of trade shocks, especially
in the context of a strong dollar.

HIGH

MEDIUM
The new government has
expressed commitment to
resolving the FX shortages, but
has not yet developed a
definitive plan to do so,
pending the receipt of
technical assistance.

 The risk further highlights the
need for structural reforms to
foster investment outside the
energy sector, and for frontloaded fiscal adjustment to
maintain fiscal space.



The potential impact is very
difficult to gauge, since by
their nature, f/x shortages are
a disequilibrium
phenomenon. They are
difficult to measure since
they consist, by definition, of
FX sales that are not made.
Moreover, the very existence
of the shortages engenders
an unknown amount of
precautionary FX demand,
but may also discourage
some potential buyers from
attempting to purchase FX.



Nonetheless, it is clear from
persistent and widespread
reports that the problem is
serious. There are frequent
reports that businesses are
either unable to make critical
imports, or are unable to pay
suppliers in a timely manner,
thus damaging businesses
relationships and impairing
access to external trade
credit.

 The authorities should operate
the FX market more liberally,
either via further currency
depreciation, greater sales to the
market, or some combination of
both. A durable end to FX
shortages will require a sustained
period in which the market is
shown to clear, so that
precautionary demand for FX in
excess of immediate needs is
eventually limited, once
credibility in the management of
the FX market is restored.

The Risk Assessment Matrix (RAM) shows events that could materially alter the baseline path (the scenario most likely to materialize in
the view of IMF staff). The relative likelihood of risks listed is the staff’s subjective assessment of the risks surrounding the baseline
(“low” is meant to indicate a probability below 10 percent, “medium” a probability between 10 and 30 percent, and “high” a probability
of 30 percent or more). The RAM reflects staff views on the source of risks and overall level of concern as of the time of discussions
with the authorities. Non-mutually exclusive risks may interact and materialize jointly.

Annex IV. A Case Study of Diversification in Trinidad and
Tobago
Trinidad and Tobago remains highly dependent on the energy sector, and the need to diversify the
economy has been long understood. This annex discusses different types of diversification and
outlines Trinidad and Tobago’s historical experience. It finds that while the development of an
export-oriented petrochemical sector fostered export diversification in the 1980s/90s, export
diversification has stalled since 2000, while no progress has been made in diversifying domestic
output. Cross-country experience suggests the country should support “horizontal” export
diversification and continue to improve the business climate.
1.
Although Trinidad and Tobago’s (TTO) government has been speaking about the
need to diversify its economy as early as 1966, the country remains highly dependent on
the energy sector. Thanks to its hydrocarbon resources, TTO increased its per-capita income
from US$640 in 1962 to US$15,760 in 2013, making it one of the wealthiest countries in the
Caribbean. Prior to recent sharp declines in energy prices, energy sector output accounted for
about 45 percent of GDP, contributed 55 percent of government revenues and 82 percent of
merchandise exports. Such dependence transmitted the volatility of energy prices into GDP
growth and encouraged pro-cyclical economic policies, as government spending has tended to
follow the energy revenue cycle.

A. Types of Diversification
2.
“Diversification” can refer to both domestic output and export diversification. For
the former, we analyze the changes of each sector’s share in output and labor productivity. For
the latter, we look at the development of new markets/products, diagnose export structure
changes by using different export diversification indices, and examine history for policy changes
that appeared to influence export diversification.
3.
Export diversification can be disaggregated into horizontal and vertical
diversification. Horizontal diversification refers to an increase in the number of new export
product lines or the evenness of export value shares across different product lines. Vertical
diversification is the upgrading of product quality along a so-called “quality ladder,” which
vertically arrays a specific export product line from low to high unit values.1 Upgrading product
quality along the ladder increases value-added in a given product category, thereby increasing
their export values.
4.
The concept of economic complexity is related to diversification. A country has a
more complex product structure if it can produce more knowledge-intensive products.
IMF (2014a) followed the methodology of Henn et al. to estimate the quality of each of the 851 SITC 4-digitplus (Rev.1) categories in the UNCOMTRADE dataset, then aggregated the quality of each product category into
higher-level sectors (SITC 3-digit, 2-digit and 1-digit) by using current trade values as weights.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

TRINIDAD AND TOBAGO

Hausmann, et al. (2011) maps major products according to similarities in their knowledge
requirements in a product space. It then calculates an economic complexity index based on a
country’s relative comparative advantage in the product space and the number of different
products it can export.2 A country with higher complexity relative to its per capita income has
higher expected growth because a country tends to move toward a level of income per capita
compatible with its level of embedded knowhow.

B. Trinidad and Tobago’s Experience

from 276 to 419 in this period.5
6.
However, export diversification has stalled since 2000. Led by the export of liquefied
natural gas (LNG) from 1999, the export share of energy products increased again, from
36 percent in 1998 to 60 percent in 2010. Although major non-energy exports such as chemicals
(excluding fertilizers) maintained their export share, other manufactured exports saw their export
shares and export growth rate declining significantly. The development of the LNG industry
appeared to crowd out the development of the non-energy sector. Williams (2013) points out
that almost all FDI between 1998 and 2005 was concentrated in the energy sector, and domestic
private investment in agriculture declined sharply.

If a country has a relative comparative advantage in a certain exported good, its share in the country’s total
exports will be larger than the share of the good in total world exports. For example, TTO exported US$2.9 billion
of petroleum oils (18 percent of its total exports) while the world’s exports of petroleum oil were 5.2 percent of
world exports.

2

All three measures are calculated based on export shares from 1962 to 2010. Lower values indicate higher
diversification for all three indices. The Theil index can be decomposed into extensive and intensive margins. The
extensive margin focuses on the number of new export products, while the intensive margin captures relative
export values in different categories of products, with more evenly distributed values representing more
diversification within that product line.

3

Cadot et al (2011) define new products as those that have not been exported in at least the two previous years,
but have been exported in the two following years.

4

The total number of product lines at the end of the period does not equal to the sum of the number of product
lines at the beginning of the period and the new products, since some product lines existing at the beginning of
the period will also have been withdrawn from the export portfolio.

TTO also has made no progress in diversifying its domestic output. Since 1988, the
labor force has increasingly moved out of agriculture and manufacturing to the service sector,
where productivity growth has been negative. Since that time, manufacturing’s employment
share dropped from 10 percent to 8 percent while the agricultural employment share fell from
13 percent to 4 percent. With the share of employment now in the low productivity service sector
rising from 35 percent in 1988 to over 40 percent, it appears that domestic output diversification
has been constrained.

growth.

2013

8.
The main driving force for the increase in export diversification was the
government’s development, on the back of the two oil booms in the 1970s, of an exportoriented petrochemical sector. After completing a number of petrochemical projects by around
1982, petrochemical exports became the third
largest export product category after LNG and
oil. By 2010, petrochemicals’ share of total
exports had grown to about 30 percent. Another
factor that may have contributed to greater
export diversification stemmed from TTO’s
economic crisis at the end of the 1980s. The
government’s reform program included
divestment of several loss-making state-owned
enterprises, the devaluation of the TT dollar and
the granting of incentives to attract investment.
These measures improved the manufacturing
sector’s competitiveness and facilitated export diversification, for example the share of machinery
and transport equipment in total exports doubled from 1.2 percent in 1987 to 2.5 percent in
1998.

C. Lessons from Experience
10.
Lessons from relevant comparator countries (oil exporters and small non-energy
exporters) suggest that improving business environments, developing human capital and
focusing on high value-added industries can spur diversification. In that sense, TTO is ranked
INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

49

TRINIDAD AND TOBAGO

far behind many of the relevant countries in the Theil diversification index. Other countries, such
as those of the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC), provide “negative” lessons (what not to do). For
these countries, export diversification has been limited because high transfers and subsidies and
a significant distortion of the labor market through very high levels of public employment and
high public sector salaries discourage private firms from investing in the non-oil tradable sectors,
and workers from seeking jobs in the private sector. Even so, most GCC countries have higher
rankings than TTO in the quality of their business environments, indicating ample room for TTO
to improve.
11.
These lessons suggest the priorities for TTO should be to support horizontal export
diversification and continue to improve the business environment. Given limited ability to
pursue further vertical diversification (quality improvements for given product lines), the
emphasis should be on introducing new product lines (improving the extensive margin), while
increasing value-added in current non-energy export product lines to improve the intensive
margin.6 Further improving the business environment can lay the foundation for the private
sector to take initiatives to innovate and grow their businesses. In particular, improving the
quality of human capital and reducing structural impediments to investment will help attract FDI
to improve technology and know-how to increase the value-added of TTO’s products.

Hausmann, Hidalgo, et.al. suggest the best way to increase horizontal diversification is by developing products
that are close in knowledge requirements to what is currently produced (for instance, diversifying from milk
production to ice cream production). This way, knowledge can be developed that over time, allows a country to
spread the range of its product lines. See http://atlas.cid.harvard.edu/

Exchange Arrangements
Trinidad and Tobago has accepted the obligations of Article VIII, Sections 2, 3, and 4. Its exchange
system, a de jure float, is classified as a stabilized arrangement under the Fund’s revised
methodology.

2

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

TRINIDAD AND TOBAGO

Trinidad and Tobago maintains an exchange restriction and two multiple currency practices subject
to the Fund’s approval under Article VIII, Section 2(a) and Section 3. The exchange restriction arises
from the authorities’ restriction of the exchange rate (i.e., by restricting the maximum market buy
and sell rates, and prohibiting foreign exchange (FX) transactions beyond the maximum rates), while
not providing enough FX (i.e., through the CBTT ’s FX interventions) to meet all demand for current
transactions at that rate. The CBTT also limits sales of its FX intervention funds to meeting only
“trade-related” demand, which do not include non-trade transactions that are, however, current
international transactions as defined under Article XXX(d) of the IMF’s Articles of Agreement, and
encourages authorized dealers to similarly prioritize sales of FX obtained from other sources. These
actions result in undue delays in access to FX to make payments or transfers for current international
transactions and external payment arrears.
The two multiple currency practices arise from the absence of a mechanism to prevent the potential
deviation of more than two percent at any given time among several effective exchange rates
regulated by the authorities, for spot exchange transactions; namely:
a.

The potential two percent deviation between: (i) on the one hand, the CBTT’s intervention
rate and the authorized dealers’ sell rates (the maximum of which is anchored on the
intervention rate plus fixed margins), and (ii) on the other hand, the authorized dealers’ buy
rates (the maximum of which is limited at the previous day’s mid-rate).

b.

The potential two percent deviation between: (i) on the one hand, the buy and sell rates for
FX transactions between the CBTT and the government, and (ii) on the other hand, the
authorized dealers’ sell rates.

Last Article IV Consultation and Recent Contacts
The 2014 Article IV mission was concluded on June 16, 2014 and staff visits took place on
January 19–26, 2015 and September 18–25, 2015.
Technical Assistance
Trinidad & Tobago has received a significant volume of TA across the various CARTAC fiscal,
financial, statistical, and macroeconomic program areas including: TA missions to TTSEC on stress
testing of securities markets, development of macroprudential indicators and an in-country
workshop on financial stability indicators. On fiscal issues, CARTAC has supported Treasury
modernization in cash management and bank reconciliation issues, while the Inland Revenue
Division has benefited from focused TA on establishing internal audit capacity, enhancing
performance management capabilities, and in-country training on basic taxpayer audit techniques.
CARTAC assistance was provided to strengthen macro projection capacity and in the development
of a medium-term strategy document. Statistical reform priorities have advanced with CARTAC help
with CPI rebasing and with national accounts. Beyond the provision of direct in-country TA, officials
from Trinidadian institutions participated in training events and regional workshops across all areas
of CARTAC expertise.

RELATIONS WITH THE WORLD BANK
(As of April 2016)
Since graduation in 2003, Trinidad and Tobago has had no lending program with the World Bank
Group (WBG). However, technical and advisory services have been provided since then focusing on
promoting a better investment climate in order to stimulate inclusive growth, economic
diversification and increased competitiveness; strengthening institutional capacity; and, building a
modern and efficient public sector, with a view to promote the achievement of the country’s longterm development objectives.
Between the fall of 2013 and the fall of 2015, the Government proactively reached out to the Bank
for new technical assistance activities in a number of areas, including financial sector development,
anti-money laundering and the fight against terrorism financing.
Trinidad and Tobago also receives grants in the Accounting and Extractive Sectors (Extractive
Industries Transparency Initiative—EITI).
Since the September 2015 elections, the authorities have requested technical assistance from the
World Bank in several areas, including on a Public Expenditure Review. A World Bank team also
returned to Trinidad and Tobago after the IMF/World Bank Spring Meetings in April 2016 for
further discussions.
Reimbursable Advisory Services
Reimbursable Advisory Services Program: The RAS program with the Government of Trinidad
and Tobago currently covers: (i) Investment Climate Reform; (ii) Anti-Money Laundering (National
Risk Assessment); and, (iii) Broadband Strategy.
Technical Assistance
In 2014, the Government of Trinidad and Tobago requested the World Bank to provide in-depth
technical assistance on a range of issues, such as: insolvency resolution, tax alternative dispute
resolution, developing a commercial court, and developing a collateral registry. This request was
formulated in the form of a RAS, following the successful completion of a previous RAS agreement
with the Government that focused on investment climate reform with particular attention to the
reforms related to Doing Business indicators. Under the previous RAS, which was concluded in May
2014, the World Bank supported the Government to reform the business registration process. This
technical assistance program contributed to a positive reform on Starting a Business, and the Doing
Business Report 2015 reflected these improvements in the efficiency of the business registration
process. In the area of insolvency resolution, the World Bank provided recommendations on how to
align a draft legislation with international good practices and supported the Government with
technical assistance on a new insolvency legislation that was passed in May 2014. In the same year,
the Government also requested to develop a RAS agreement related to improving the country’s

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

TRINIDAD AND TOBAGO

investment promotion capacity and developing special economic zones. More recently, changes in
the fiscal conditions in Trinidad and Tobago have decreased the resources available for the
proposed activities, and the discussions on the finalization of the RAS agreements have been
limited.
RAS—Trinidad and Tobago—Broadband for Development Phase 2: This activity seeks to help
transform the country's economy into a more diversified one that effectively utilizes broadband
connectivity to unleash the power of information, technology, and knowledge throughout all
economic sectors. The specific objective of the RAS is to support broader use of broadband for
competitiveness and productivity through activities aimed at increasing IT skills, developing an ITEnabled Services industry, and promoting innovation through open data. This Phase 2 of the RAS
builds on the results of the Phase 1 Broadband Strategic Plan. The activities are designed to
address bottlenecks identified in the supply as well as in the demand (i.e. take-up) of broadband
services. As of April 2016, project implementation is pending. Several activities have been
completed; and the legal agreement is going to be extended to reschedule the pending activities’
milestones.
Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI): Trinidad and Tobago was officially granted
candidate status for EITI in 2011 and was declared fully “compliant” in January 2015. The Ministry of
Energy and Energy Industries (MEEI) leads the implementation of the initiative with the objectives of
making Trinidad and Tobago's energy sector one of the most transparent in the world, as well as to
work closely with civil society. With support from a MDTF EITI grant, one of the successes in Trinidad
was raising awareness with youth, civil society, communities, and parliamentarians. The MDTF EITI
grant was extended up to September 2014, and Trinidad and Tobago has asked for a second grant
from the newly established Extractives Industries Global Programmatic Support (EGPS) MDTF. This
program would focus on building a Caribbean knowledge hub for extractive industries with UWI,
developing an environmental indicator to include in the EITI, and finally automating the information
on EI revenues. Funding decision by EGPS MDTF donors is pending. TTEITI is set to publish the next
report covering fiscal revenues from 2014 by end-September 2016. The scope of this report is being
expanded to also include the mining sector.
National Risk Assessment (NRA): The World Bank is supporting Trinidad and Tobago's National
Risk Assessment (NRA) on Money Laundering (ML) and Terrorism Financing (TF). This project targets
to assist them in their self-assessment of ML/TF risks with broad participation from various
stakeholders. In addition to better understanding of the ML/TF threats and vulnerabilities in the
country, the project aims to improve the skills and knowledge of the government agencies in
assessing ML/TF risks and applying a risk-based approach in this area. A workshop to begin the
NRA was held on March 17-19, 2014 in Port of Spain, organized through the AML/CFT Compliance
Unit of the Ministry of National Security and the Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU). Since the first
workshop, the World Bank team continued to provide technical assistance to the Ministry of
National Security and the FIU, including through the review and provision of comments on the draft
NRA report and Action Plan prepared by Trinidad and Tobago. The final workshop that will mark the
conclusion of the World Bank’s technical assistance on the NRA is scheduled for May 24─25, 2016.

RELATIONS WITH THE INTER-AMERICAN
DEVELOPMENT BANK (IDB)
(As of April 15, 2016)
Financing
The 2016-2020 Country Strategy (CS) is being developed and is expected to be submitted for
approval during the last quarter of 2016. Meanwhile, the current CS 2011─2015 remains in force
until the end of 2016 with the following priority areas: (i) financial sector regulation and supervision;
(ii) public sector management; (iii) education; (iv) social protection; (v) climate change; (vi) energy;
(vii) water and sanitation; and (viii) transport.
The current CS also envisages private sector development, fiscal sustainability, and integral solutions
for local government, as areas for further dialogue during the CS period. We have programs
approved under the current CS in 5 of the original 8 priority areas. It should be noted that at least
one (1) SG operation was approved in a dialogue area as the Bank sought to respond to changes in
client needs. The CS had envisaged Sovereign Guaranteed (SG) lending of US$1.5 billion for the
period, however, SG lending reached only US$695.0M, as of March 15, 2016.

STATISTICAL ISSUES
(As of April 2016)
I. Assessment of Data Adequacy for Surveillance
General: Serious shortcomings in the provision of timely, comprehensive, and accurate data
significantly hamper surveillance, economic analysis and policy formulation. The authorities are
committed to improving data provision, through the establishment of an independent National
Statistics Institute (NSI), which will replace the Central Statistical Office (CSO). Legislation to establish
the NSI is expected to be passed this year. In the meantime, the CSO has made substantial progress in
recent months to reduce the backlog in producing some data, particularly trade statistics and GDP
estimates. The CSO has secured new offices, taken on additional provisional staff to reduce the
backlog of uncompleted surveys, agreed with the CBTT to acquire staff to work on National Accounts
and other statistics, and made arrangements with a number of international partners to secure
technical assistance.
Real Sector Statistics: While there is still a significant lag in providing overdue historical data,
noticeable improvements have been achieved in 2015. The production-side real GDP data for 2012
have been finalized, while the calculation of real GDP data for 2013 and 2014 are expected to be
finalized by the end of 2016. The last expenditure-side GDP data is from 2008 and there are no
immediate plans to produce such data. Since the end of 2014, the CSO has reduced lags in publication
of its quarterly labor force bulletin to about two quarters (from one year). Per CARTAC suggestion, the
CSO also has a plan to produce quarterly GDP statistics, the timeline of which depends on the amount
of available resources to fulfill its specific staffing needs.
Price Statistics: A revised method to estimate the Retail Price Index (RPI), implemented in mid-2012,
corrects flaws that created a significant upward bias, primarily in the food component. In addition, the
RPI basket has been rebased to January 2015, with the weights on each item updated to reflect the
results of the latest household budgetary survey in 2008/2009. However, estimation of food index
inflation remains a concern as it rose over 29 percent the past two years compared to 13 percent for
All Items. This is possibly due to flaws in substitution procedures for seasonal items. As regards the
producer price index (PPI), the business establishment list (BEL) has not been updated in years and the
current weights used in the PPI are nearly 40 years old.
Government Finance Statistics: The Ministry of Finance (MoF) compiles fiscal data using a national
classification system for government transactions and debt of the central government. The compilation
follows the GFSM 1986 methodology. Data on public enterprises and statutory bodies are compiled
and published once a year. These data are compiled by three different divisions of the MoF and are
subject to differences among them, particularly with respect to transfers.
Monetary and Financial Statistics: The monthly monetary accounts currently cover the CBTT and
other depository corporations (ODCs), that is, commercial banks and nonbank financial institutions
(finance houses, merchant banks, trusts, and mortgage companies), which report to the CBTT on a
monthly basis. No data are reported by income funds, which act like money market funds and should
be included as part of the ODCs sector. Since mutual funds are not regulated by the CBTT, an
agreement with the Securities and Exchange Commission of Trinidad and Tobago is needed to obtain
their data on a regular basis. Following two monetary and financial statistics (MFS) missions that visited
the country in 2012, Trinidad and Tobago migrated to the standardized report forms (SRFs) for the

10

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

TRINIDAD AND TOBAGO

submission of CBTT and ODCs data to STA; these broader data are now used in the monetary sector
accounts in this staff report.
In May 2014, an MFS mission supported the CBTT in developing SRFs for the other financial
corporations (OFCs) sector, covering insurance corporations, pension funds, the Heritage and
Stabilization Fund (HSF), the Agricultural Development Bank (ADB), and the Mortgage Finance
Company (TTMF). The CBTT needs to expand the coverage to, at least, the National Insurance Board
(NIB), the Unit Trust Corporation (UTC), the Home Mortgage Bank (HMB), and the credit unions.
Trinidad and Tobago reports to STA all core and some encouraged financial soundness indicators.
External sector statistics: Quarterly aggregate balance of payments estimates and annual balance of
payments data are disseminated by the CBTT in its national publications, although with some lag.
Generally, compilation of balance of payments statistics is heavily based on administrative records and
survey data from entities with external transactions. Official trade data from the CSO are only available
up to February 2012, while data for the rest of 2012 and up to September 2015 are CBTT estimates,
using trade partner data. The CBTT’s estimates for trade data are flawed due to methodological
weaknesses. The CSO is in the process of reviewing and auditing recently compiled trade data covering
2012 to September 2015. The authorities, following the recommendations from recent TA missions, are
also revising the data in the goods and services account to address under-coverage and
misclassifications, particularly in the valuation of imports at c.i.f., missing insurance services provided to
nonresidents, and in services provided by nonresident companies to local oil and gas corporations.
Recent TA missions have also assisted the authorities in the compilation of data on external assets and
liabilities of mutual funds, the compilation of the International Investment Position (IIP), the proper
classification of dividend flows by energy sector companies, other required improvements for
subscription to the SDDS, and implementation of the Balance of Payments Manual sixth edition. The
authorities anticipate that the audits of the data can be completed in time for an official release by
September 2016.
Data with comprehensive coverage of external loans and domestic debt of the entire public sector, as
well as publicly guaranteed debt has been migrated to the Commonwealth Secretariat Debt Recording
and Management System (CS-DRMS) utilized by the Ministry of Finance and the CBTT.
II. Data Standards and Quality
Participant in the General Data Dissemination
System (GDDS) since 2004.

No data ROSC is available.

III. Reporting to STA
Only partial fiscal data are reported to STA, covering above and below the line transactions with a

Gross External Debt

Statement by Otaviano Canuto, Executive Director for Trinidad and Tobago
and Veronica Ramcharan, Senior Advisor to the Executive Director
May 20, 2016
On behalf of our authorities, we wish to thank the mission team for the constructive
discussions on macroeconomic developments and policy issues in Trinidad and Tobago.
In line with staff recommendations, the authorities are focused on consolidating the fiscal
position and implementing strategic structural reforms towards enhancing the country’s
competitiveness and medium-term growth prospects.
Despite the significant challenges posed by the need to adjust to lower energy prices,
Trinidad and Tobago is far from a crisis situation. The country has enormous strengths,
including low levels of public debt, substantial financial buffers, a well-educated work
force and a stable political system.
Upon assuming office in September 2015, the new administration had less than one
month to present a budget to Parliament. Recognising that energy prices could remain
low over the long term and faced with considerable structural challenges to increase
economic diversification, the budget accommodated the fiscal adjustment requirements
but was also carefully balanced to avoid exacerbating the economic slowdown. Under no
illusions about the external environment, the authorities refined the budgetary framework
during the Mid- Year Budget Review (MYBR) presented in April 2016 and further
calibrated policy adjustments to meet their medium term economic objectives. The
MYBR reflected expectations of lower oil and gas prices and entailed both adjustments in
government spending and measures to broaden revenue sources.1
Economic Developments and Outlook
Trinidad and Tobago has suffered major consecutive shocks to its economy given the
global financial crisis, followed more recently by a large terms of trade shock. Despite the
negative impact of the global financial crisis, the country’s economy remained resilient and
quickly rebounded. Since mid-2014, the economy has been hard hit by the sharp decline in
oil and gas prices. Indeed, growth contracted in 2014 and 2015, and lower domestic
absorption is expected to continue in 2016. Given the permanent nature of the decline in
hydrocarbons prices, the economy has been gradually adjusting to a new reality.
Underpinned by the authorities determined efforts, including significant fiscal adjustment
measures in order to maintain macroeconomic and external stability, GDP is expected by
staff to rebound sharply to 2.3 percent in 2017 and maintain steady positive growth over the
medium term. Despite the enormous challenges faced by the country, headline inflation has
been well contained by historical standards and the unemployment rate has remained very

2
low. The resilience of the employment numbers suggests that private sector employment has
also held relatively firm, and that employment has not been solely dependent on government
“make-work” programs. In addition, the economy is protected by substantial financial
buffers, including US$9.8 billion in international reserves or 13.4 m o n t h s of import cover
and a Heritage and Stabilization Fund (HSF) with US$5.8 billion, which together is
equivalent to about 63 percent of GDP in 2015.
In an environment of heightened uncertainty and downside risks in the global economy, the
authorities remain vigilant and focused on strengthening resilience. They recognize the
enormous challenges stemming from the volatility of hydrocarbon prices and its impact on
the main source of fiscal revenue generation. The new government has undertaken
significant fiscal consolidation measures and implemented a tactical reform agenda designed
to preserve macroeconomic stability and promote sustainable and inclusive growth. Beyond
the short term, measures include structural reforms to raise productivity, promote
constructive value-added economic diversification and further advance regional and global
integration.
Fiscal Policy
The Ministry of Finance recently introduced a Medium-Term Fiscal Consolidation
Framework which is an important anchor in supporting the authorities’ efforts to meet
budgetary targets, improve expenditure prioritization, and foster improved government
performance. This plan also aims to invigorate high value-added investments, intensify
h u m a n capital development and enhance public sector delivery, within the constrained fiscal
space. The course of fiscal consolidation is underpinned by further reforms to broaden the
government’s revenue base, rationalize subsidies and better optimize supplies and services
expenditure. As such, in the fiscal year 2016 the authorities intend to reduce total expenditure
by TT$4 billion than originally budgeted in October 2015. Consequently, the fiscal deficit for
2016 is expected to be around 4 percent of GDP using the cash basis accounting
methodology.
The financing gap for 2016 and 2017 will be closed through several available avenues,
including borrowings and one-off items of extraordinary income, such as recoveries from the
sale of CLICO assets, dividends from the National Gas Company (NGC), drawdowns from
the HSF, and proceeds from the Phoenix Park IPO. By 2018 the authorities are determined
to be well on their way to achieving a balance between current income and expenditure, with
reliance on borrowings only for capital expenditure. Moreover, the authorities noted that if
revenues disappoint, they are willing to further reduce expenditures.
The authorities have remained steadfast in their commitment towards fiscal consolidation,
careful debt management and prudent expenditure restraint. Trinidad and Tobago’s
external debt continues to be low, despite a projected increase over the medium term to
moderate but sustainable levels. The authorities have made significant progress towards

3
establishing a medium term debt management framework, which will significantly
enhance their capacity to address potential risks.
Alongside cuts in recurrent spending – including the reduction of operational expenditure by
7 per cent for all ministries – fiscal consolidation is being led by increased revenue
generation from more diverse sources as well as enhanced tax efficiency and compliance.
Some measures include the implementation of a property taxation system; broadening of the
VAT base; increasing excise taxes; elimination of fuel subsidies and reducing other
subsidies and transfers; and the introduction of wage and hiring restraint mechanisms.
Furthermore, a levy of 7 percent on online purchases of goods and services fr o m overseas
retail companies will be effective from September 01, 2016. In addition, the capital
investment program for fiscal year 2016 was reduced by 14.2 percent from the previous
fiscal year and has been re-prioritised, refocused and, where necessary, consolidated
towards areas and activities that will stimulate growth and achieve economic and social
transformation.
The government has also made major efforts towards improving revenue administration, and
proposes to establish a unified revenue authority in the near future. This will facilitate
greater information sharing among revenue agencies, tighten rules on transfer pricing, and
increase resources devoted to tax enforcement, which over time are expected to substantially
increase revenue yields. This has been done in conjunction with amendments to several
pieces of pertinent legislation, facilitating the required fiscal measures, including the
passage of the Finance Act No.1 of 2016 in February and the Finance Bill No.2 of 2016,
which is expected to be passed later this month. The government has also instituted steps to
establish a “General Accounting Office”, which will be responsible for the continuous realtime assessment of actual budget performance, and is also in the process of establishing a
T a x Policy Unit, with technical assistance (TA) from the Fund.
The authorities have also commenced discussions with the energy industry on reforming
energy taxes, and have requested TA from the Fund in this area as well. As noted in the
MYBR, the removal of fuel subsidies have commenced and will be carried out in a phased
manner, using the savings to improve the social safety nets and reduce transportation costs
for low-income groups. The authorities also propose to implement a new pricing
mechanism that will allow world oil price changes to pass through to local fuel prices.
Given the significant level of consolidation required, the authorities noted the importance of
public support to ensure the success of the required adjustment. Accordingly, they have
increased efforts to enhance transparency and consultations on a regular basis, and
inaugurated a National Tripartite Advisory Council in March 2016 consisting of stakeholders
from the government, private sector and labor sector.
Going forward, fiscal policy will continue to be focused on ensuring sound public finances
while remaining supportive of policies for sustainable and balanced growth. In particular,

4
measures to improve the quality and efficiency of public service delivery will be
complemented by socio-economic support to vulnerable households. The authorities in
collaboration with the World Bank have undertaken a comprehensive review of social
expenditures to reduce costs and improve program efficiency, without sacrificing the social
safety nets needed to protect the most vulnerable.
Monetary and Exchange Rate Policy
While monetary policy is primarily aimed at controlling inflation, which remains well
contained, the Central Bank of Trinidad and Tobago (CBTT) follows a multiple policy
objective framework, which provides much needed flexibility in light of the volatile global
environment. The policy rate of 4.75 percent as of December 2015 is assessed to be
appropriate given the balance of risks to the outlook for domestic inflation and growth, as
well as taking into consideration the downside risks emanating from the external
environment. The CBTT Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) continues to closely monitor
the heightened external risks and assess the implications on macroeconomic and financial
stability.
The exchange rate policy is aimed at minimizing market volatility, and is reflective of
supply and demand conditions in the foreign exchange market. Going forward the policy
would also be guided by the presumption that the terms of trade shock is permanent.
Reflective of supply and demand conditions in the foreign exchange market, the TT dollar
exchange rate has begun to depreciate against the US dollar since the end of 2015. Official
intervention in the foreign exchange market will continue to take place via biweekly
auctions, and the rate and volumes at each intervention will continue to be informed by
economic conditions at the time, particularly anticipated foreign exchange inflows and
outflows.
In April 2016, the government announced that the TT dollar would not be allowed to
depreciate more than 7 percent from its September 2015 level. The authorities emphasize the
need for caution in light of the on-going fiscal consolidation coupled with the significant
austerity measures being undertaken to protect macroeconomic stability. The impact of a
swift depreciation of the exchange rate could result in significant inflationary pressures,
increases in wage pressures and even lead to labor unrest. Consequently, the government has
given assurances that the currency will not become unstable and that monetary and fiscal
policies will be conducted to support the level of depreciation signaled above.
Regarding the Article VIII issue, the authorities maintain that they have not “imposed
restrictions on the making of payments and transfers for current international transactions”
nor “have their official exchange rate used by the CBTT for government transactions
deviated by 2 percent or more from the prevailing market exchange rate”, and therefore do
not agree that their exchange rate policy gives rise to exchange restrictions and multiple
currency practices.

5
While the IMF staff has noted that there is a shortage of foreign currency in the market,
there was no evidence that the authorities had imposed a restriction on making payments
and transfers. Trinidad and Tobago de facto exchange rate regime is classified as a stabilized
arrangement by the Fund. The aggregate data collected from the financial institutions on a
daily basis illustrates that there has generally been a distributional problem among the
commercial banks themselves leading to the formation of occasional queues, and in such
circumstances the CBTT will make special interventions to clear the queues. In this regard,
at the conclusion of the Article IV consultation, the Minister of Finance specifically
requested TA from the Fund to analyze the issues surrounding the foreign exchange market
and to find a suitable resolution to the assumed distributional issue.
Financial Sector Reform
The authorities recognize that there have been delays in passing important financial
legislation, including the Insurance Bill, which pose certain risks to the financial sector.
Therefore, as a matter of priority, they are committed to rectifying this problem and intend to
lay the Insurance Bill and the Credit Union Bill in Parliament shortly. It should be noted that
the long outstanding Procurement Bill has been enacted and the necessary regulations and
amendments are in train to effect the proclamation of the Act. This should be finalized by the
end of 2016. The authorities are also reviewing several other pieces of legislation, including
the Financial Intelligence Unit Act and the Central Bank Act to align them with international
best practice and will bring to Parliament their full legislative agenda, within the current
f i s c a l year.
The authorities are also committed to addressing all AML/CFT shortcomings arising from
the recently conducted Caribbean Financial Action Task Force (CFATF) evaluation and
continue to take the necessary action to further strengthen the AML/CFT framework.
Pertaining to the long-standing issues related to CL Financial, the authorities continue to
progress the resolution of this matter and the plan entails the sale of a number of assets in
order to satisfy long outstanding liabilities in the context of the Memorandum of
Understanding signed in 2009. Subsequently, the traditional insurance portfolio will be
divested in an orderly fashion.
Structural Reforms
Trinidad and Tobago has earned a reputation as an excellent investment destination f o r
international businesses and has one of the highest per capita incomes in Latin America and
the Caribbean. Nonetheless, the authorities recognize that diversification is absolutely
critical to ensure long term economic growth and sustainability. As such, they are
determined to push ahead with the diversification drive to ensure a socio-economic
environment that is attractive to domestic and foreign investment. Taking into account
policy constraints, the authorities have targeted initiatives in areas that can deliver the

6
greatest growth return within these constraints.
The diversification strategy is centered around international financial services, tourism
and related maritime activities. The authorities have commenced discussions with several
foreign investors pertaining to a set of integrated projects which include the expansion of
the international financial centre, a new commercial port, a maritime and shipbuilding
complex, an industrial park and the development of Special Economic Zones.
Trinidad and Tobago is well positioned to establish a viable and robust maritime economy.
An initial step is the establishment of a maritime maintenance facility to meet the
requirements of the existing fleet of government-owned naval and maritime assets. Such a
facility will catalyze the development of a ship-repair and ship-building industry, eventually
emerging as a hub within the CARICOM region, thereby creating a New Maritime
Economy.
A Tourism Growth Strategy is currently being developed along with the reconvening of the
Trinidad Tourism Standing Committee. The strategy will inform the direction of the
industry, and address major issues impacting tourism development, such as airlift,
marketing, product development and destination management. Tourism development will
also be facilitated through the Tobago Comprehensive Development Plan, which sets out a
road map for the development of the island, towards ensuring that the tourism sector
becomes an important driver of economic growth.
Public-Private Partnerships (PPPs) will continue to play a major role in infrastructure
development. The authorities have made provisions to support the growth and development
o f the technical and operational aspects of PPP arrangements. Trinidad and Tobago is
already utilizing PPPs to deliver public infrastructure services in several areas, including
health, education and ICT (Information and Communication Technologies). Technical
capabilities are being incorporated into a number of government ministries and the
authorities intend to continue using PPPs when establishing long-term contracts with
investors for infrastructure development. In addition, the authorities remain committed to the
implementation of a modern, transparent and fair public procurement system. They are
currently in the process of conducting a review of the existing legislation and expect to table
the appropriate amendments and institute the New Procurement Agency in 2016.
The authorities are also assessing a number of work programs, in particular CEPEP and the
Unemployment Relief Program (URP), with the objective of achieving cost efficiencies and
streamlining the operational framework to ensure value-added output. Moreover, the
government has established a High-Level Committee to oversee the reform of the
Government Assistance for Tuition Expenses (GATE), to rationalize expenditure and ensure
that program objectives are aligned with the country’s development needs. In an effort to
promote a competitive and productive industrial relations climate, the authorities have
undertaken a comprehensive review of all labor legislation, including the Industrial

7
Relations Act and the Retrenchment and the Separation Benefits Act.
Despite ongoing diversification efforts, the authorities recognize that the energy sector
remains their major source of revenue and must continue its development. During the last
five years, fiscal incentives were provided for the sector. However, there were no specific
incentives that targeted the development of small and marginal gas fields. These are
important resources which can make a significant contribution to addressing the current
supply/demand imbalance. Accordingly, the government has initiated discussions with all
relevant stakeholders on the adoption of appropriate strategies and incentives, which will
result in new production in these fields. They will also move forward with a comprehensive
review of existing arrangements along the natural gas value chain and, where necessary,
implement appropriate measures on key aspects of the oil and gas sector.
Pertaining to outstanding data deficiencies, the authorities have made considerable progress
– within a very short space of time – towards the establishment of an independent and
autonomous National Statistical Institute (NSI). The required legislation establishing the NSI
is expected to be passed in 2016. In collaboration with CARTAC, the operational efficiency
of the Central Statistical Office has greatly improved as data backlogs have been
significantly reduced, along with the generation of new time series data.
