Republic on economic developments and policies. Based on information available at the time
of these discussions, the staff report was completed on July 13, 2002. The views expressed in
the staff report are those of the staff team and do not necessarily reflect the views of the
Executive Board of the IMF.

•

A Public Information Notice (PIN) summarizing the views of the Executive Board as
expressed during its July 30, 2007 discussion of the staff report that concluded the Article IV
consultation.

The policy of publication of staff reports and other documents allows for the deletion of market-sensitive

The 2007 Article IV discussions were held in Damascus during April 29–May 16, 2007.
The staff team met with Minister of Finance Al-Hussein, Deputy Prime Minister Dardari,
Central Bank Governor Mayaleh, Minister of Tourism Al-Kalaa and representatives of
financial institutions and the donor community. The mission comprised Mrs. Moalla-Fetini
(head), Messrs. Dridi and Hasan (all MCD), Mr. Saker (MCM), Mr. Beddies (PDR), and
Ms. Winkler (research assistant). Mr. Shaalan, Executive Director for Syria, joined the policy
discussions.

•

Significant progress toward exchange rate unification was made on January 1, 2007
with the abolition of the official “budget” rate; a substantial liberalization of import
financing has also been achieved. The authorities have announced their intention to tightly
manage the value of the Syrian pound (SP), and to switch the reference currency from the
U.S. dollar to the SDR in the coming months. Syria continues to avail itself of the
transitional provisions of Article XIV, and maintains exchange restrictions that are subject to
Fund approval under Article VIII.

•

The authorities have requested an FSAP, with missions tentatively scheduled for late 2007
and early 2008.

•

Significant data weaknesses continue to hamper the staff’s ability to conduct effective
surveillance and monitor the economy’s response to ongoing reforms. The weak
statistical infrastructure has been unable to cope with the acceleration of structural reforms,
and the inherent difficulties in recording the flows of people, goods, and money from and
into Iraq have added to this challenge.

•

The authorities released the mission’s concluding statement.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
Focus of the report
Discussions focused on the macroeconomic and structural policy adjustments that would be needed to
continue to deal with the decline in oil revenues, rebalance the sources of growth toward investment
and durable gains in external markets, expand and diversify the production base of the economy, and
boost job creation to absorb a growing number of entrants to the labor market.
Background
Over the past three years, Syria has rebounded from a half decade of weak growth, despite an
unsettled regional environment and a sharp drop in oil production. The economic recovery underway
since 2004 has gained momentum, benefiting from inflows from Iraqi refugees and abundant
liquidity in the Gulf region. Private investment has strengthened, reflecting an improved business
climate, and exports have made strong gains, particularly in some Arab markets, reflecting higher
demand and improved access under the Great Arab Free Trade Area. Despite a 10 percentage points
of GDP drop in oil proceeds over the past three years, and the large demand shock from the Iraqi
refugees, inflationary pressures have been contained owing to the economy’s supply responsiveness
and a sustained, timely and sizeable fiscal adjustment. Public debt is relatively moderate, and the
international reserves cover is comfortable. Barring policy missteps or a deterioration in the regional
environment, the near-term outlook for growth and inflation looks favorable.
Views of the authorities
The authorities were pleased with the economy’s performance, but were also well aware of the
challenges ahead. They underscored the need to solidify growth which would require persevering
with quality fiscal adjustment and accelerating market reforms. In particular, the authorities indicated
that they were determined to start the reform of the costly petroleum price subsidies (PPS) before the
end of the year, and to put back on track the agenda for an early adoption of the VAT. They also
highlighted recent progress in establishing the regulatory framework for the financial sector and
strengthening the monetary policy framework, and committed to moving ahead with financial sector
reform with input from the upcoming FSAP.
Staff recommendations
To consolidate the gains achieved in recent years, the staff underscored the need for a steadfast
implementation of the reform agenda embedded in the ambitious tenth five-year development plan.
As further reliance on cuts in capital spending would start to hamper growth, staff re-iterated the call
the call to move swiftly to phase in the PPS reform and launch the VAT, which are the two key
pillars of the fiscal reform strategy discussed during last year’s Article IV consultation. The staff also
encouraged the authorities to focus on gaining credibility in operating the new managed float
exchange rate system, within a tight trading range. The authorities were also encouraged to develop
new monetary instruments in order to enhance monetary management, allow further interest rate
liberalization, alleviate the costs on banks of managing Syrian pound liquidity, and pave the way
toward greater exchange rate flexibility over the medium term. Supervisory-capacity building and
state banks’ restructuring are paramount to address emerging vulnerabilities and enhance financial
sector development. Utmost priority should be given to strengthening the statistical base to enhance
economic surveillance and reduce the risk of policy mistakes.

I. INTRODUCTION
1.
Over the past three years, Syria has rebounded from a half decade of weak
growth, despite an unsettled regional environment and a sharp drop in oil production. The
economic recovery underway since 2004 has gained momentum, benefiting from inflows from
Iraqi refugees and abundant liquidity in the Gulf region. Private investment has strengthened,
reflecting an improved business climate, and exports have made strong gains. Despite a large
drop in oil proceeds (10 percentage points of GDP) and the large demand shock from the Iraqi
refugees, inflationary pressures have been contained owing to a sustained, timely and sizeable
fiscal effort. Public debt is at a relatively moderate level, and the international reserves cover
remains comfortable. Barring policy missteps or a deterioration in the regional environment, the
near-term outlook for growth and inflation is favorable.
2.
The 2007 Article IV consultation discussions were held prior to the presidential
elections.
3.
The authorities have been responsive to Fund advice. They have continued to make
progress in furthering the comprehensive reform agenda embedded in the 10th five-year
development plan (FYDP, 2006–10)—which is broadly in line with Fund policy
recommendations1—and in building institutional and regulatory frameworks for key markets.
Appendix I reviews key measures implemented since the last Board meeting.
II. RECENT ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS
4.
Staff estimates growth of non-oil GDP to have picked up to some 6–7 percent in
2
2006. Given a 6½ percent drop in oil production, this would be consistent with overall growth
of 4½–5 percent (Table 1). Growth was driven in part by the impulse from the influx of Iraqi
refugees, which is likely to have had a significant first round impact on aggregate demand,
which was amplified by a wealth effect associated with the boom in real estate and rental prices.
The Iraqi refugees, whose number grew by 60 percent in 2006, to about 1½ million (8 percent of
the Syrian population), are still believed to be living mainly off their savings. A good harvest
added to employment gains in boosting the consumption of Syrian households, and the surge in
non-oil exports to Iraq and other Arab countries contributed to the strong growth performance.
Growth is also likely to have been supported by a pick-up of private investment, given the
impressive increase in investment approvals (Box 1).3

1

See IMF Country Report No. 06/294, Annex I.

2

The central bureau of statistics’ preliminary estimate of non-oil GDP growth in 2006 is 10 percent, but the
reliability of this estimate is compromised by methodological problems and weak data sources.

3

Data on actual investment are scant, but there are some indications that the boom in investment approvals has not
translated yet into a commensurate increase in actual investment. Given the data weaknesses, it is difficult to
ascribe relative weights to the various factors that have contributed to growth.

5
Box 1. The Surge in Investment Approvals
The past two years have witnessed an impressive growth in the volume of investment
approvals across sectors:
•

Under the most important investment law, Law No 10 of 1991, investment approvals
reached US$9.2 billion (26 percent of GDP) in 2006, more than 2½ times the level of
2004. Almost three-fourths of investment is in increasingly diversified industrial
projects (including cement, steel, food processing, pharmaceuticals, textiles, and power
generation), and another 20 percent is in the transport sector. Investment in the much
publicized real estate projects (consisting of commercial, recreational, and other
services associated with government housing projects) represented only about
15 percent of the total approved projects in 2005 (SP 60 billion) and their social
returns—which are feared to be low in some circles—may actually be quite high if
they are part of a well diversified investment strategy. The share of foreign direct
investment (FDI) approvals in total approvals is estimated to have remained fairly
stable at about 20 percent.

•

Investment approvals in other sectors were equally strong. Approvals in tourism
reached US$2 billion in 2006, 25 times higher than in 2004, and the ministry of
tourism is now preparing to launch mega projects following the success achieved in
attracting investors to smaller projects. Investment in the financial sector grew by
200 percent in 2006 (both banking and insurance), and the trend is expected to remain
strong in the coming years.

5.
The build-up of inflationary pressures since mid-2005 seems to have abated in
recent months. While average inflation increased to 10 percent in 2006, end-of-period
inflation has been on a downward trend, reaching 4½ percent in March 2007. Half of the
increase in inflation in 2006 is attributed to food prices, owing to weather-related shortages
and the impact of stronger domestic demand. The increase in the U.S. dollar price of
imported non-fuel commodities, together with some pass-through of the exchange rate
depreciation at end-2005, may also have played a role.

in taxes, providing a small boost to the tax intake (Tables 2 and 3).

Credit policy played a useful role in controlling domestic demand. State
banks slowed their lending, which helped cool the credit boom experienced in 2004–05
(Tables 4 and 5). Private sector credit growth in 2006 (18½ percent), while still fast, reflects
a process of financial re-intermediation with a strong contribution by the nascent private
banking sector (Box 2). Net lending to the public sector was the main contributor to money
growth. Administered deposit interest rates, which turned negative in real terms during most
of 2006, are now positive.

Box 2. The Rapid Growth of Private Banks
Private banks have made considerable progress in gaining market share and appear well
capitalized and managed. Following the opening of the first three private banks in 2004, four
more banks entered the market in the last two years, and several more banks are expected to start
operations in 2007, including some Islamic financial institutions. These banks are mainly
subsidiaries of regional banks (typically Lebanese or Jordanian based), although majority
ownership is held by Syrian investors, who have shown strong interest in the sector, as reflected
in large oversubscription of the banks’ IPOs. In 2006, private banks captured 70 percent of the
increase in private sector deposits and contributed 45 percent of the growth in loans to the private
sector. As a result, their share in private sector deposits and loans reached 25 percent and
14 percent, respectively, by end-2006. The private banks have introduced new products
contributing to an overall improvement in the quality of financial services by putting competitive
pressure on state banks. Although the pace of increase in their loan portfolios slowed down in
2006, it was still above 100 percent. This development start bodes well for the ability of Syria’s
restructured financial sector to meet the demands of a growing economy.

The assessment of external sector developments is complicated by several data
weaknesses, and the factors behind the relatively small weakening of the overall BOP
during the last three years, despite the sharp decline in net oil exports, are not entirely
clear.5 Fiscal adjustment, the inflows associated with the Iraqi refugees, and some pickup in
FDI seem to have been the main contributing factors that offset, in part, the impact of the
decline in net oil exports. The contribution of the oil sector to foreign exchange earnings
became almost nil in 2006—down from close to 11 percent of GDP in 2003—and is
expected to turn negative in 2007. The non-oil goods and services account is estimated to
have narrowed by about 4 percentage points of GDP on the back of strong growth in non-oil
exports, particularly to some Arab countries, owing to stronger demand and improved access
under the Great Arab Free Trade Area.

The overall balance of payments swung from a surplus of about 2 percent of GDP in 2003 to a deficit of
some 2 percent of GDP in 2006. At the same time, the parallel market rate has depreciated modestly by
6 percent in nominal effective terms.

Unification

9.
Amid the shocks that have buffeted the external accounts (including an episode
of politically-driven pressures on the currency), steady progress toward exchange rate
unification and current account convertibility has been made. Substantial liberalization
of import financing was achieved in September 2006,6 and with the elimination of the official
budget rate in January 2007, the economically significant exchange rates were unified.7 Since
then, the central bank has been managing the value of the currency vis-à-vis the U.S. dollar

BOP. The pick-up of
inflation in 2006 led to some real appreciation (7.3 percent for the parallel market rate and
2.2 percent for the weighted average rate). Syria’s price competitiveness, as measured by real
bilateral exchange rates, has remained comparable or better than that of neighboring
countries such as Lebanon, Jordan, Morocco, and Turkey, but it has deteriorated vis-à-vis
Egypt and Tunisia (Figure 1).8

Remaining restrictions include access to foreign exchange to finance car imports and payments and transfers
on the invisibles account. Their removal is likely to have only a minor impact on the foreign exchange market.

Staff are still seeking clarification on multiple currency practices, including those identified in Annex II.

There is some anecdotal evidence of improvements in non-price competitiveness, such as in tourism, where
there was a marked improvement in quality with the recent opening of five-star hotels. Also, according to some
investors, Syrian products have shed the “bad-quality” label that used to be attached to them when they were
mainly used as means to repay the debt to former Soviet Union countries. Their quality, variety, and reliability
is responding rapidly to the demanding standards of the new markets in which they are entering.

Broad-based reforms over the past two years have led to significant changes in
the economic and financial landscape, but the reform agenda remains substantial.
Progress toward exchange rate unification and current account convertibility, investment
facilitation under a more liberal investment regime, tax reform, trade and financial
liberalization, and the on-going development of appropriate regulatory frameworks in key
sectors9 have all contributed to improving the investment climate. Notwithstanding these
achievements, a number of structural rigidities that continue to hamper investment and
productivity growth still need to be addressed. Among middle-income countries, Syria’s
relatively low GDP per capita (⅔ of the group average) reflects both low productivity and
low labor force participation (45 percent) (Figure 2). The latter is likely to mirror poor
employment opportunities in a still largely constrained business environment.10

Syria ranks poorly in The World Bank’s survey on indicators for the cost of Doing Business (130 out of
175 countries). Doing Business shows Syria’s worst performance to be in enforcing contracts (153 ranking),
trading across borders (147 ranking), and starting a business (142 ranking).

III. REPORT ON THE DISCUSSIONS
11.
Overall, the authorities were pleased with the strengthening of the economy, but
were also well aware of the challenges ahead. They drew comfort from the boom in
investment approvals, the resilience of the economy to the troubled regional environment and
its ability to mitigate the impact of the decline in oil revenues, and the strength of the Syrian
pound, which they view as a vote of confidence in their policies. The authorities agreed with
the staff that the economic recovery of the past three years was likely to have been to some
extent driven by the impulse originating from the influx of Iraqi refugees. They also
recognized that for growth to be sustained, it was important to rebalance aggregate demand
toward investment, which would require further fiscal consolidation and deeper market
reforms. Against this background, discussions focused on the near-term outlook, policies to
preserve fiscal solvency, a more explicit monetary policy framework, financial sector
development, and key structural reforms.
12.
An overarching prerequisite for the success of reforms in all areas is to
strengthen domestic capacity by hiring people with the required competencies and
offering them competitive salaries. In particular, the authorities acknowledged that data
weaknesses were indeed hampering macroeconomic management and their ability to monitor
the economy’s response to ongoing reforms. They noted that a first step toward addressing
this problem, budget allocations to statistical institutions had been increased substantially,
and efforts were being made to revamp accounting standards in public enterprises.
Nevertheless, the authorities were afraid it will take time to overcome the skill-deficit
in this area.
A. Near- and Medium-Term Outlook
13.
The authorities and staff agreed that the growth outlook for 2007 was
favorable. The reforms implemented in recent months, continued stimulus to aggregate
demand from the Iraqi presence, and favorable growth prospects globally and in the region
are expected to support consumption and non-oil exports, and to encourage higher private
investment. These factors would help sustain growth at about the same pace as in 2006,
although a deterioration in weather conditions, which recently hit the cereal and cotton crops,
may dampen growth somewhat. Given a projected 7 percent decline in oil GDP, this would
be consistent with overall growth of about 4 percent in 2007. Downside risks include adverse
political developments in the region, and uncertainties that could affect adversely private
investment.
14.
To keep inflation in check, macroeconomic policies should remain appropriately
tight. Regarding fiscal policy, the authorities are aiming to reduce the budget deficit to
5 percent of GDP, despite an expected further fall of oil revenues of about ¾ percentage
points of GDP. This would require an improvement in the non-oil budget deficit of some
1½ percent of GDP in 2007, which they plan to achieve through a further rationalization of

16
capital spending. The authorities and staff concurred that the current level of benchmark
interest rates was appropriate, and that state banks’ lending should remain in line with the
monetary objectives.
15.
The staff has prepared a central medium-term scenario that occupies a middle
ground in the range of possible policy outcomes. The central scenario assumes a moderate
further fiscal adjustment but not enough to offset the decline in oil revenues, leading to a
steady rise in public debt.11 The drying up of inflows from the Iraqi refugees and the rise in
the oil import bill as oil reserves continue to dwindle will put pressure on the external
position, making it harder to reconcile the competing goals of maintaining both a stable
exchange rate—to underpin price stability—and a comfortable international reserves cushion
(Table 7). Stress tests on public debt point to added pressures on the debt dynamics from
various possible shocks (Tables 8 and 9, and Figures 3 and 4). Additional pressures could
also arise from higher health and education spending on the Iraqi refugees.
16.
If the reform momentum is strengthened relative to the staff’s central scenario to
underpin fiscal and external sustainability, positive synergies between fiscal adjustment and
growth could put the

11

In this scenario, the budget deficit is kept at 5 percent of GDP, which would lead to an increase in the debt to
GDP ratio to 50 percent in 2012, from 36 percent in 2006.

17
B. Preserving Fiscal Sustainability
17.
The authorities acknowledged that fiscal adjustment so far had been facilitated
by the flexibility of capital outlays and that further fiscal consolidation would require
difficult measures. The flexibility in the budget was the result of a conservative approach in
which past increases in oil revenues were not used to create permanent entitlements, but
rather to finance public infrastructure. As oil receipts started to decline, rationalization and
re-prioritization of development spending made it possible to adjust to the lower revenues.
However, at 8 percent of GDP in 2007, development expenditures are approaching a level
where further cuts may start to hurt growth.
18.
At the same time, the authorities agreed that a strong further fiscal effort was
needed to address the secular decline in oil revenues and preserve fiscal and external
sustainability. To this end, they concurred with the need to move swiftly to phase in the
petroleum price subsidy (PPS) reform and launch the VAT, which are two key pillars of the
proposed fiscal reform discussed during the 2006 Article IV consultation:12
•

12
13

Regarding PPS, the authorities recognized that such reform was a must, as its cost
was untenable, exceeding 10 percent of GDP in 2006. Preparations have moved into a
higher gear, and the authorities are hoping to start the reform before the end of the
summer. The speed of price adjustment and the amount of compensation to be
provided to households13 involve two main trade-offs: (i) the risk of destabilizing
inflation expectations associated with a sharp increase in prices versus adjustment
fatigue from a drawn-out process, and (ii) less fiscal savings versus more political
palatability. The table below quantifies some of these tradeoffs and provides
estimates of the annual yield of this measure under various options.

See IMF Country Report No. 06/295 for a background study on the reform agenda for fiscal consolidation.

Initially, and in the absence of means-testing mechanisms, the reform envisages a return to all households of a
certain share of the gross fiscal gains in the form of a flat per person cash compensation, which would already
imply a more equitable targeting. This system could be implemented easily by piggy-backing on the existing
coupon system for rice and sugar.

•

Regarding the VAT, major delays have been experienced in implementing key
prerequisite tax administration measures, including the adoption of a tax procedures
code and an integrated IT system. Moreover, a decision has yet to be made regarding
the design of the VAT, as the authorities are still examining various options to
mitigate its regressivity. The authorities committed to accelerating preparatory work
and hope to be able to introduce the VAT by early 2009.

•

Deepening PE reform and undertaking a review of public expenditures could
contribute to further fiscal savings and improve the effectiveness of government
spending. The authorities noted that they were working on developing an agenda for
PE reform, which favors public private partnerships. Liquidations or outright sales
not currently under consideration.

19.
The authorities did not exclude the possibility of raising civil servants wages,
particularly in light of the start of the PPS reform. Increasing wages to mitigate the
impact of PPS reform would not be advisable as it would introduce a rigidity in the budget,
put pressure on private sector wages, and would not alleviate the burden on other deserving
segments of society.

19
C. Strengthening the Monetary/Exchange Rate Policy Framework
20.
In the context of the current transition in Syria’s exchange rate arrangement, a
key policy decision is whether the central bank should adopt a fixed exchange rate or
allow some upfront flexibility. The authorities and staff recognized that some limited
flexibility was already built into the system prior to unification; such limited flexibility had
served Syria well, as it allowed the exchange rate to respond to market forces, while
providing a fairly solid nominal anchor. Volatility of the parallel market rate, at which the
bulk of private sector transactions used to take place, and the associated transaction costs,
had no obvious negative impact on trade expansion.
21.
The authorities were of the view that the exchange rate should remain the main
nominal anchor of the monetary policy framework. With only rudimentary monetary
instruments, the exchange rate was the only variable the central bank could target effectively
for the moment. Moreover, Syria’s ample international reserves provided a comfortable
cushion to deal with temporary shocks. At the same time, however, the authorities thought
that pegging the unified exchange rate (either de jure or de facto) would not be advisable. In
this regard, the authorities emphasized prevailing uncertainties about the equilibrium rate.
These uncertainties, even if BOP data were to improve, are likely to persist far into the future
as the economy’s fundamentals continue to be impacted by the ongoing depletion of oil
reserves, further trade liberalization, and the transition to a market economy. Also,
fear-of-floating effects, which are small for the moment, could develop rapidly under a
peg, given the high level of deposit dollarization of the nascent private banking sector
(see below and Box 2).
22.
In this context, the authorities noted that the challenge for the CBS in the next
12 months was to establish credibility in operating a managed float within a tight
trading range. This would require: (i) speeding the process of licensing the foreign
exchange bureaus; 14 (ii) creating a unified interbank foreign exchange market in which the
CBS could establish itself as a credible market maker; (iii) gaining sole control over
exchange rate management by transferring the remaining international reserves owned by the
Commercial Bank of Syria (CBoS) (60 percent of total reserves) to the CBS in exchange for
market-based remunerated government securities;15 (iv) working with the ministry of finance
to establish the long-delayed government securities market and improving public debt
management; (v) establishing mechanisms to control liquidity, including by promoting an
interbank market; and (vi) addressing the weaknesses in the BOP statistics to develop reliable
14

Only five foreign exchange bureaus have been licensed so far; 117 pending requests for licensing are being
processed.
15

With the CBoS’s open exchange position equal to 7 times its capital, the risk is high of uncompetitive
behavior in the FX market; in addition, day-to-day transactions of the CBoS could hinder the objectives of the
CBS and lead to incoherent policies.

20
indicators on exchange rate misalignment. Moreover, the credibility of the regime in
maintaining price stability and avoiding an erosion of external competitiveness will hinge
critically on supportive fiscal and incomes policies.
23.
The authorities have announced that they plan to switch the referencing of the
SP from the U.S. dollar to the SDR under the managed float regime. Once the CBS gains
credibility in operating the new regime and a better understanding of BOP developments,
such a move would be appropriate. Referencing to a basket ensures greater stability of the
nominal effective exchange rate, and therefore minimizes the macroeconomic disturbances
induced by fluctuations in the cross-rates between the major currencies. It would also be a
useful intermediate step in moving toward greater flexibility. These benefits are likely to
outweigh any costs of moving away from targeting a single currency, including some
weakening of the role of the exchange rate as a nominal anchor. This is due to Syria’s limited
reliance on the U.S. dollar in wage negotiations and other contracts.
24.
The staff estimates suggest that Syria’s external current account deficit has
increased significantly in recent years owing to the sharp drop in oil exports. Looking
forward, however, the authorities’ intentions to implement a further strong fiscal adjustment
and deepen structural reforms are consistent with promoting external stability and achieving
a sustainable current account deficit. The authorities were of the view that the level of the
exchange rate was broadly appropriate, given the strong performance of non-oil exports and
the absence of protracted losses of reserves. In light of the lack of adequate BOP data, it was
not possible for staff to compute CGER indicators.
25.
The authorities expressed their intention to move quickly toward removing all
the remaining foreign exchange restrictions and multiple currency practices and hoped
to be a in a position to accept the obligations under Article VIII before the end of the
year.16 The staff encouraged the authorities to provide a legal basis to the ongoing current
account liberalization by adopting a new foreign exchange law. The staff noted that the Fund
stands ready to assist them on the preparatory steps for Article VIII acceptance.
D. Financial Sector Development
26.
Notwithstanding the commendable efforts made to develop the financial sector,
there are still numerous impediments and several sources of vulnerabilities:
•
The development of a competitive banking sector is constrained by the slow progress
in state banks’ restructuring. The unreformed public banks, characterized by high
16

The mission left a note with the authorities detailing its preliminary assessment of the remaining restrictions
that would need to be removed. Ahead of the formal acceptance of Article VIII obligations, further joint work
by LEG/MCM would be necessary to verify that all appropriate steps have been taken.

21
non-performing loans, low profitability and undercapitalization will likely hinder
further reforms, for fear of a loss of market share and a decline in profitability.
•

Banks incur heavy costs in managing SP liquidity owing to administered deposit
interest rates and slow progress in developing market-based instruments to manage
liquidity. These costs might increase further with the CBS policy of raising the
minimum capital requirement in an environment of limited lending opportunities and
increased competition, which may lead to excessive risk taking or encourage further
dollarization (currently, 55 percent of private banks deposits are denominated in
U.S. dollars).17 Although lending in U.S. dollars is not generally allowed, except for
trade financing, banks are likely to be blurring the distinction between lending for
trade and project financing, which increases their exposure to credit risk of poorly
hedged borrowers.

•

Progress in building up regulatory and supervisory capacity has not kept pace with
financial liberalization, which is particularly worrisome in light of private banks’
fast-paced credit expansion (Box 2). The ability of bank supervision to assess the
adequacy of banks’ internal controls and their risk management practices is limited,
and the CBS compiles only a restricted set of financial soundness indicators to
monitor the health of the banking system (Table 11). Regulatory forbearance, the
existence of other regulatory agencies, and weak operational independence undermine
the supervisory process. Under these circumstances, systemic risks could go
undetected, and excessive risk taking by some banks, including country risk
associated with their placement abroad, could threaten their solvency.

•

Lastly, slow progress in developing the payments system imposes large costs on
banks. Additional costs arise from difficulties in registering and enforcing collaterals.

27.
The authorities agreed on giving priority to building supervisory capacity and
restructuring the state banks. They indicated that their request for an FSAP was motivated
by the need to make a thorough assessment of the progress achieved so far and lay a road
map for reforms in the next 2–3 years. They also noted that with technical assistance from
the Fund and other donors the CBS is progressively addressing existing capacity constraints,
most notably in the areas of bank supervision (staff of the supervision department has been
tripled to about 70 in the past few years), research, accounting, and reserve management.
The authorities are also seeking to build broad support for the adoption of a draft central bank
law that would give the CBS greater autonomy and strengthen its supervisory authority.

17

For the moment, this largely reflects a transfer to the new private banks of Syrian deposits that were held
aboard.

22
E. Trade Liberalization and other Structural Reforms
28.
Further efforts on trade liberalization and improving the business climate are
key elements of the authorities’ reform agenda. The authorities noted the progress made in
the past year in forging ahead with the ambitious agenda under the FYDP. Major highlights
include the new investment law, which put foreign and domestic investors at par; the new
amendments to the income tax law, which lowered tax rates and unified tax incentives; the
adoption of a new Basic Finance law, which unified the current and investment budget and
severed the links between PEs and the budget; and the completion of the round of tariff
reduction started three years ago, which resulted in lowering the average tariff rate from
20 percent in 2003 to 14½ percent in 2006. The authorities were also optimistic about the
benefits of the free trade agreement with Turkey and regarded the integration in the Great
Arab Free Trade Area as having been generally successful. In addition, they indicated that
passage of the draft laws on the central bank and public debt management was a top priority
for the coming months, and committed to accelerating the process of adopting the
competition and company laws.
IV. STAFF APPRAISAL
29.
Syria’s overall economic performance continued to be strong in 2006, and the
outlook for 2007 is positive. Notwithstanding an unsettled regional environment and the
impact of a sharp decline in oil proceeds, the economic recovery that started in 2004 remains
on track. Non-oil GDP grew at a brisk pace in 2006, benefiting from sizeable inflows from
the Iraqi refugees and abundant liquidity in the Gulf region. Strong gains in non-oil exports
and a pick up of private investment contributed to growth. The economy’s supply
responsiveness, a tighter credit policy, and fiscal discipline helped contain inflationary
pressures, despite the large demand shock from the Iraqi influx. Also, the boom in
investment approvals bodes well for the country’s medium-term growth prospects.
30.
Looking forward, steadfast implementation of the ambitious 10th FYDP is
essential to consolidate these gains. Rebalancing growth toward investment and achieving
durable gains in external markets require maintaining financial stability and deepening
structural reforms. More competition in product markets, a friendlier and more transparent
business environment, greater exposure to international competition, and further financial
liberalization are necessary to close the reform-gap with other countries in the region and
position Syria to take advantage of regional and global integration.
31.
The size and quality of the fiscal adjustment achieved in the past three
years is commendable and has contributed to a significant strengthening of Syria’s
medium-term fiscal prospects. However, given the prospective further decline in oil
revenue, and the possible need to accommodate significant costs of bank restructuring, an
additional strong fiscal effort is needed over the medium term. As further cuts in capital
spending would start to hamper growth, the authorities are encouraged to move ahead with

23
the two key pillars of a credible fiscal consolidation strategy, namely the PPS reform and the
introduction of a VAT with a single rate and few exemptions. Concerns about social equity
would be best addressed by excises on luxury goods and well targeted spending programs, or
by enhancing the progressivity of income taxes. A restrained wage policy is also essential to
support the needed fiscal adjustment and protect competitiveness. In addition, the pace of tax
administration reforms need to be accelerated to support the introduction of the VAT.
32.
Deepening PE reform could go a long way in improving efficiency and stopping
the drain on the public finances. The provision in the new public finance law to sever the
links between PEs and the budget is a step in the right direction. However, for this reform to
bear fruit, it is essential that PEs be subjected to the discipline of the market to avoid shifting
their losses from the budget to the state banks and that all quasi-fiscal activities be reflected
transparently in the budget. The authorities are also encouraged to restructure the public
enterprises that are deemed viable, select those to be privatized, and develop case-by-case
solutions, including liquidation, to deal with the rest. Allowing restructured PEs further
flexibility in employment decisions, and in wage and pricing policies, will be essential for
their future viability.
33.
Progress toward exchange rate unification and current account convertibility
are important and welcome steps. The enactment of a new foreign exchange law would
send a strong signal about the irreversibility of these reforms and the authorities’
commitment to re-entry into the global economy. The new legislation should abrogate the
existing complex set of foreign exchange laws and regulations and enshrine full current
account convertibility, a unified exchange rate, and repatriation of profits from FDI.
34.
In the current context, the central bank is encouraged to ensure a consistent
implementation of a managed float within a tight trading range. Such a regime strikes
the right balance between the need to continue to use the exchange rate as the main nominal
anchor while allowing some flexibility. In the future, greater flexibility will facilitate
adjustment to the likely changes in the equilibrium real exchange rate arising from the
ongoing depletion of oil reserves, trade liberalization, and the transition to a market
economy.
35.
To maintain external stability over the medium term, Syria needs to continue
with strong fiscal adjustment, accelerate structural reforms, and allow greater
exchange rate flexibility. Although it is difficult to come to a definitive conclusion in the
absence of adequate BOP data, there are no indications that the exchange rate is significantly
misaligned. This seems to be confirmed by the strong performance of non-oil exports, and
the lack of protracted loss of international reserves or unsustainable official or quasi-official
borrowing. Nonetheless, the staff believes that the impact of the recent real appreciation on
external competitiveness should continue to be monitored carefully, particularly in light of
the depletion of oil reserves, and the large uncertainties about the level of the current account
deficit and the sources of its financing. Looking ahead, priority should be given to improving

24
the BOP statistics to provide a basis for developing indicators to assess exchange rate
misalignment.
36.
The new monetary/exchange rate policy framework needs to be supported by
the prompt introduction of market-based instruments of monetary control. This is
important to enhance monetary management, facilitate interest rate liberalization, alleviate
the costs on banks of managing Syrian pound liquidity, and pave the way toward greater
exchange rate flexibility in the medium term. The authorities are encouraged to move swiftly
on the much delayed agenda of launching a government securities market and improving
public debt management.
37.
The rapid take-off of private banking, although promising, illustrates potential
pitfalls in the sequencing of reforms. In this regard, it is essential that the strengthening of
the regulatory and supervisory capacity keeps pace with financial liberalization. Vigorous
action is required to restructure the state banks to stem the accumulation of additional
nonperforming loans and encourage greater competition. Moreover, quick progress in
developing market-based instruments of monetary control is also needed to reduce excessive
risk taking and discourage dollarization. The central bank should also play a catalytic role in
setting up a credit registry.
38.
A new central bank law is essential to strengthen the monetary policy
framework, improve bank supervision, and modernize the CBS. The law should enshrine
price stability as the main objective of monetary policy and grant the CBS operational
independence in monetary and exchange rate management. It should also give full
supervisory authority to the CBS over all banking institutions, and grant the CBS the
autonomy required to set its own budget within agreed guidelines with the government.
These improvements are necessary if the central bank is to manage successfully the more
complex monetary and financial system that is emerging.
39.
A challenging task ahead is to implement the legislation adopted in recent years
in an effective manner. This will require an infusion of new technical expertise in the public
administration. The cost of paying competitive wages to attract skilled personnel pales in
comparison to its potential benefits. The authorities are encouraged to introduce a special
fast-track scheme to attract highly skilled managers and to provide intensive training to
newly hired young graduates, while continuing to work toward a far-reaching civil service
reform.
40.
The progress made in furthering market reforms is welcome, but the remaining
structural reform agenda is substantial. The authorities are encouraged to further
streamline the list of prohibited imports, abolish the system of industrial quotas, reduce the
number of tariff bands, and eliminate nontariff barriers. Removing barriers to competition in
product markets and tackling the high costs of contract enforcement, starting a business, and
property registration can also have a large payoff in increasing labor productivity and

25
promoting Syria’s export potential. Moreover, the authorities are encouraged to speed up the
process of adopting the new competition and company laws.
41.
The quality of Syria’s data is not fully adequate for surveillance purposes and
could lead to policy mistakes. Utmost priority should be given to mobilizing the needed
expertise to upgrade the statistical system, particularly in the areas of the BOP and the
national accounts and price statistics. It is also important to develop short-term indicators of
economic activity to monitor the state of the economy on a timely basis.
42.
Syria continues to maintain exchange restrictions under Article XIV, Section 2
(Appendix I). It also maintains exchange measures subject to approval under Article VIII
(Appendix I). Absent specific measures to eliminate these exchange restrictions and multiple
currency practices in a timely manner, the staff does not recommend that the Executive
Board grant approval for their retention. The staff urges the authorities to eliminate
remaining restrictions and multiple currency practices without delay.
43.
It is proposed that the next Article IV consultation take place on the standard
12-month cycle.

26
Appendix I. Syrian Arab Republic: Reforms Since the Last Article IV Consultation
Fiscal
•

A draft public debt management law has been submitted to the Cabinet and is
expected to be approved soon.

•

A new Basic Finance Law was approved in October, 2006, replacing a 1967 law. The
law revamps public finance management rules and unifies the budget by bringing the
investment budget under the purview of the ministry of finance. It also sets new rules
for arms’ length relationship with PEs, allowing them to retain their after-tax profits
and to decide on their investment programs, provided they can secure financing from
the markets. The new law will take effect with the 2008 budget.

•

The 2003 income tax law was amended a second time, lowering further the top
marginal corporate rate from 35 to 28 percent (and to 14 percent for shareholding
companies). (Decree No. 51 of October 1, 2006). Furthermore, the amendment
provides uniform tax incentives to projects under the new investment law in order to
encourage labor intensive activities and investment in rural areas (see below).

•

The tax rate on real estate sales and rentals was reduced further, and the tax structure
simplified (Decrees No. 52 and 53 of October 2, 2006).

•

The first large taxpayers unit was opened in September, 2006, a landmark in the
modernization of tax administration to prepare for the adoption of the VAT.

Monetary and financial
•

In August 2006, the Money and Credit Council issued several decisions aimed at
liberalizing and reforming the interest rate structure. In particular, lending rates for
state banks were liberalized; interest rates on current account deposits were unified at
one percent, and banks’ deposits at the CBS in excess of the statutory reserve
requirement started to be remunerated at a rate of one percent.

•

Seven foreign exchange bureaus and companies which used to operate in the parallel
market have been licensed, and over 100 applications are being processed.

•

Four new private banks and, for the first time, eight private insurance companies
started operations in 2006.18 Three Islamic banks and one Islamic insurance company
were licensed in 2007.

18

The Law is not clear as to limits on foreign ownership in private insurance companies.

27
•

The minimum capital requirement for private banks is expected to be raised soon
from US$30 million to US$100 million.

•

Decree No 55 issued on October 1, 2006, established the Damascus Securities
Exchange (DSE). The DSE is expected to start operations early in 2008, with
46 companies expected to trade initially.

•

Decree No 15 of February 19, 2007 allowed the licensing of financial institutions for
micro credit with a minimum capital of US$5 million.

Exchange rate, trade, and market regulation
•

Licensed banks have been authorized to finance all permitted imports
(Decree No. 5204, September 2006).

•

The official budget rate was abolished on January 1, 2007. One single market
reference rate is now quoted by the CBS.

•

The Free Trade Agreement with Turkey went into effect in January 2007.

•

A new customs law adopted in October 2006 allowed for further automation and
streamlining of customs procedures, including implementation of ASYCUDA.

•

In August 2006, the authorities published, for the first time, the list of prohibited
imports.

•

A new law (Decree No 8 of January 27, 2007) ended all tax exemptions that used to
be offered under investment law No. 10 of 1991 (mainly a tax holiday for the first
five years of operation of a project, plus two additional years if at least half of the
value added was destined for foreign markets).19 The exemption from customs duties
on all imported equipment was maintained. The new law also allows full annual
repatriation of profits—the previous law allowed repatriation of profits derived from
export activities only—and ownership of land. The new law covers all sectors with
the exception of tourism, financial services, and real estate.

19

For investment in tourism, which is governed by another law, the previous exemptions included a tax holiday
for seven years, plus 50 percent discount on the profit tax thereafter. The discount has been phased out.

28
•

Decree No 9 of January 27, 2007 established a new Investment Authority in charge of
regulating investment, overseeing the improvement of the investment climate, and
promoting investment in Syria. The SIA will operate a one-stop-shop service to
facilitate business start ups.

•

Consumer protection and food safety laws were passed in late 2006.

Reforms “in the pipeline”
•

The draft company and competition laws have been approved by the Cabinet and
submitted to Parliament.

•

Two laws on real estate development and mortgage lending have already been drafted
and are expected to be adopted soon.

•

A draft Central Bank Law would be adopted in late 2007–early 2008.

•

The 49 percent limit on foreign ownership in banks is expected to be raised in
2007/08, which will allow full branching by international banks.

•

A credit registry is expected to become operational in late 2007/early 2008.

•

A law is being drafted to pave the way toward incorporating the Syrian
Telecommunications Company and creating an independent regulatory body.

•

A draft law has been submitted to the Cabinet, which will encourage family run
businesses to turn into private shareholding companies. It will also encourage greater
transparency in business’s books by eliminating punitive taxation and antiquated FX
accounting rules.

1/ Indicates coverage of public sector, e.g., general government or nonfinancial public sector. Also whether net or gross debt is used.
2/ Derived as [(r - p(1+g) - g + ae(1+r)]/(1+g+p+gp)) times previous period debt ratio, with r = interest rate; p = growth rate of GDP deflator; g = real GDP growth rate; a = share of foreign-currency
denominated debt; and e = nominal exchange rate depreciation (measured by increase in local currency value of U.S. dollar).
3/ The real interest rate contribution is derived from the denominator in footnote 2/ as r - π (1+g) and the real growth contribution as -g.
4/ The exchange rate contribution is derived from the numerator in footnote 2/ as ae(1+r).
5/ Defined as public sector deficit, plus amortization of medium and long-term public sector debt, plus short-term debt at end of previous period.
6/ Derived as nominal interest expenditure divided by previous period debt stock.
7/ The key variables include real GDP growth; real interest rate; and primary balance in percent of GDP.
8/ The implied change in other key variables under this scenario is discussed in the text.
9/ Real depreciation is defined as nominal depreciation (measured by percentage fall in dollar value of local currency) minus domestic inflation (based on GDP deflator).
10/ Assumes that key variables (real GDP growth, real interest rate, and other identified debt-creating flows) remain at the level of the last projection year.

For debt
stabilization

1/ Derived as [r - g - r(1+g) + ea(1+r)]/(1+g+r+gr) times previous period debt stock, with r = nominal effective interest rate on external debt; r = change in domestic GDP deflator in US dollar terms,
g = real GDP growth rate, e = nominal appreciation (increase in dollar value of domestic currency), and a = share of domestic-currency denominated debt in total external debt.
2/ The contribution from price and exchange rate changes is defined as [-r(1+g) + ea(1+r)]/(1+g+r+gr) times previous period debt stock. r increases with an appreciating domestic currency (e > 0) and rising inflation (based on GDP deflator).
3/ Defined as current account deficit, plus amortization on medium- and long-term debt, plus short-term debt at end of previous period.
4/ The key variables include real GDP growth; nominal interest rate; dollar deflator growth; and both non-interest current account and non-debt inflows in percent of GDP.
5/ The implied change in other key variables under this scenario is discussed in the text.
6/ Long-run, constant balance that stabilizes the debt ratio assuming that key variables (real GDP growth, nominal interest rate, dollar deflator growth, and non-debt inflows in percent of GDP) remain at their levels of the last projection year.

B1. Nominal interest rate is at baseline plus one-half standard deviation
B2. Real GDP growth is at baseline minus one-half standard deviations
B3. Non-interest current account is at baseline minus one-half standard deviations
B4. Combination of B1-B3 using 1/4 standard deviation shocks
B5. One time 30 percent real depreciation in 2008

B. Bound tests

Exchange Rate Arrangement

The central bank of Syria issues on a daily basis quotations for the buying and selling
exchange rates for the Syrian pound against major currencies. Up until end-December 2006,
the budget exchange rate, which applied to all public sector transactions, used to be
pegged to the U.S. dollar. During the transition since the abolition of the budget rate on
January 1, 2007 and its unification with the private sector exchange rate, the central bank has
been managing the value of the currency vis-à-vis the U.S. dollar within a tight trading range.
The de facto exchange rate arrangement is still classified as a conventional peg.

VIII. Article IV Consultations
Syria is on an annual consultation cycle. The last Article IV consultation was held in
April/May 2006 and was completed by the Board on July 31, 2006 (IMF Country Report
No. 06/294).
IX.

Article XIV and Article VIII Restrictions

Syria continues to maintain, under Article XIV, restrictions on payments and transfers for
current international transactions, including administrative allocation of foreign exchange.
Syria also maintains exchange measures that are subject to Fund approval under Article VIII:
(i) prohibition against purchases by private parties of foreign exchange from the banking
system for some current international transactions; (ii) a multiple currency practice resulting
from divergences of more than 2 percent between the official exchange rate and officially
recognized market exchange rates; (iii) a non-interest-bearing advance import deposit
requirement of 75–100 percent for public sector imports; and (iv) an exchange restriction
arising from the net debt under inoperative bilateral payments arrangements with the Islamic
Republic of Iran, and Sri Lanka.
The Executive Board adopted decision No. 13766-(06/71) at the Board meeting on
July 31, 2006:
1.
The Fund takes this decision relating to the Syrian Arab Republic’s exchange
measures subject to Article VIII, Sections 2(a) and 3, and in concluding the 2006 Article XIV
consultation with the Syrian Arab Republic, in light of the 2006 Article IV consultation
with the Syrian Arab Republic conducted under Decision No. 5392-(77/63), adopted
April 29, 1977, as amended (Surveillance over Exchange Rate Policies).
2.
The Syrian Arab Republic maintains restrictions on the making of payments and
transfers for current international transactions in accordance with Article XIV, Section 2, as
described in IMF Country Report No. 06/294. In addition, as described in IMF Country
Report No. 06/294, the Syrian Arab Republic maintains exchange measures subject to
approval under Article VIII. The Fund encourages the Syrian Arab Republic to eliminate the
restrictions maintained under Article XIV, Section 2 as soon as its balance of payments
position permits, and to eliminate the measures that are subject to approval under Article VIII
as soon as possible. (IMF Country Report No. 06/294).

Annex II. Syrian Arab Republic: Relations with the World Bank Group
(End-March 2006)
In June 2002, Syria settled its overdue service payments to IBRD and IDA, which had risen
to the equivalent of $526 million as of mid-1997, and all loans and credits were restored to
accrual status. Consequently, the country’s eligibility for disbursements was reinstated as of
July 1, 2002.
Subsequent to the agreement on arrears in July 1997, the World Bank began to provide
non-lending services to Syria. Initial activities included support for the Ministry of Finance
and the Central Bank of Syria in accounting and the establishment of an external debt
management system covered by grants from the Institutional Development Fund; planning
and implementation grants supporting Year 2000 remediation efforts; the Global
Environment Fund biodiversity project; and reviews of the trade regime (including export
promotion), health, roads, urban water and sanitation, and agricultural irrigation sectors.
In the last two years, the authorities have continued to request only non-lending support from
the Bank. Analytical services have focused mainly on the trade and investment agenda. A
trade policy report entitled “Harnessing Trade for Growth” was submitted to the Authorities
in December 2004. A Trade Logistics study was completed in 2003, and discussed in a large
workshop with the private sector in December 2003. An Investment Climate Assessment
survey was carried out in 2003 and 2004, and its result have been finalized in a report dated
June, 2005. The World Bank has also initiated a grant activity (from April 2005) in
collaboration with the Fund and the UNDP to establish a National Statistical Capacity
Strategy.
The Bank program over the next three years will be based mainly on knowledge transfer and
analytical services focusing on two pillars: (i) economic reform and transition; and
(ii) human development and social protection.
•

On the first pillar, the program will build on the substantial analytical and survey
work done in the last year that resulted in two trade reports and the forthcoming
Investment Climate Assessment report that will be presented to the authorities. The
Bank will provide both analytical advice and technical assistance to the authorities in
their search for a solid and global strategy of economic growth and transition to a
private sector-led economy. This would imply integrating within the existing trade
and investment agenda issues linked to fiscal and monetary policy, financial sector
reform, and public enterprise reform.

6
•

On the second pillar, the Bank will be focusing on assisting the authorities in
(i) developing a comprehensive education sector strategy as agreed with the Minister
of Education; (ii) understanding the labor market and designing appropriate policies
and programs, and (iii) assessing their social assistance programs and policies and
providing recommendations on reforming the system.

IFC has been active in Syria since 1999 when the Board approved the corporation’s first
investment in the country—a $1 million equity stake in a manufacturer of drip irrigation
systems. Since that time, IFC has made two other investments, including an equity position
in the first private sector bank in Syria and a loan to a chemicals company. The total held
portfolio is $20.2 million. IFC has also conducted technical assistance work, including
studies of aspects of the financial sector.

Annex III. Syrian Arab Republic: Statistical Issues
1.
Significant data weaknesses continue to hamper the staff’s ability to conduct effective
surveillance and monitor the economy’s response to ongoing reforms. The weak statistical
infrastructure has been unable to cope with the acceleration of structural reforms, and the
inherent difficulties in recording the flows of people, goods, and money from and into Iraq have
added to this challenge. The staff’s assessment of economic developments and policies is
constrained by these circumstances.
2.
In the context of Article IV missions, the authorities have expressed an intention to
address the need for statistical improvement. They have agreed that Syria’s participation in the
General Data Dissemination System (GDDS) would provide a framework for statistical
development. To this end, compilers from the Ministry of Finance (MOF), Central Bank of
Syria (CBS), and the Central Bureau of Statistics participated in a GDDS Workshop in Abu
Dhabi during February 27–March 9, 2005 and prepared preliminary metadata for all
macroeconomic sectors. On May 30, 2006, STA transmitted the draft metadata to the GDDS
coordinator to be updated, clarified where needed, and for inclusion of missing information.
As of end-June 2007, feedback from the authorities is pending.
A. Real Sector
3.
A series of STA and Middle East Technical Assistance Center (METAC) national
accounts and price statistics missions in 2005–06 found that the Central Bureau of Statistics had
made steady progress implementing prior STA recommendations and updating the base year for
the national accounts to 2000. However, the following weaknesses still exist:
•

GDP estimates by the production approach suffer from under-coverage of activities,
particularly in private services while free zone activities are not covered.

•

Estimates of household final consumption expenditures are residually determined and
include the change in inventories, as the latter is not estimated separately. The authorities
have begun to make use of the 2004 Household Income and Expenditure Survey and to
collect data on inventory changes in the public sector.

•

Consumption of fixed capital is estimated as a constant ratio of output.

•

Net income flows between residents and nonresidents derived from the balance of
payments are unsatisfactory. As a result, the estimates of gross national disposable
income, saving, gross capital formation, and net borrowing from abroad are unreliable.

•

Consumer price index calculations are nonstandard. Prices are compared to the same
month of the base year; and there are four weighing schemes, one for each quarter.
Consequently, no month-on-month inflation can be derived, and the annual average
inflation is not equal to the sum of the monthly indices. However, improvements are
imminent following technical assistance provided by METAC.

8
•

Wholesale price index is compiled and reported annually, but it is not representative of
market determined prices, as most prices are for goods and services provided at
subsidized prices by public sector enterprises.

The latest national accounts figures reported for publication in the International Finance
Statistics (IFS) refer to 2003.
B. Government Finance
5.
Government finance statistics (GFS) suffer from major deficiencies with respect
to definitions, coverage, classification, methodology, accuracy, reliability, and timeliness
that generate severe inconsistencies with monetary and balance of payments statistics.
The multisector mission of June 2004 found that compilation is adversely affected by
cumbersome institutional arrangements, inadequate resource availability and unresolved
methodological problems. The methodology used for compilation does not follow either GFSM
2001 or GFSM 1986. While budget data are available with very long lags (two years for final
budget accounts), financing data are not available. There is no dissemination of GFS data, and
even access to key data sources by GFS compilers within the MOF, such as the breakdown of
debt service into interest and amortization, is problematic. This contributes to discrepancies in
external financing as reported in the budget and the balance of payment.
6.
The largest, most persistent and volatile discrepancies are between the financing
requirements of the budget, as reported by the MOF, and government financing as reported by
the CBS. The lack of a common and regularly updated coverage of the government sector
between the MOF and the CBS, misclassification of public enterprises investment expenditure,
as well as timing and valuation issues, are mainly responsible for those discrepancies.
7.
Other discrepancies between fiscal and monetary accounts relate to the unorthodox
treatment by the CBS of some transactions with government, such as the parallel rise of
government deposits and claims on government in the CBS balance sheet, which is likely due to
government withdrawals being counted as credit and never netted out against deposits, and
profits transferred to government treated as permanent claim on the government.
8.
To address the methodological issues, the June 2004 multisector mission developed a
preliminary bridge table that maps the budgetary source data codes to the GFSM 2001
classification codes, and conducted a seminar to clarify various aspects of the GFSM 2001
methodology to the MOF officials. To help the Directorate of Planning and Statistics (DPS)
implement a proper sectorization scheme, the mission provided an updated institutional table
showing the current coverage of government and public enterprises―the investment
expenditure of public enterprises is included in government’s capital expenditure―for
circulation to all relevant agencies. Moreover, the mission formulated a detailed work plan
centered around the provision of adequate resources and training for the DPS to fulfill its tasks.
The work plan calls for the DPS to access core source data necessary for compilation―initially
on a cash basis―of annual GFS data according to the GFSM 2001, and for the resumption

9
of data reporting to STA for publication in GFSY and IFS, together with improved reporting, in
terms of coverage and classification, to the IMF’s Middle East and Central Asia Department
(MCD). The mission also recommended improvement in the timeliness of annual data,
including data on financing, and a start on the compilation of sub-annual data.
C. Monetary Accounts
9.
Monetary statistics suffer from major deficiencies which hamper the staff’s ability to
conduct meaningful analysis of monetary developments. The multisector statistics mission in
June 2004 found that while the format of monetary statistics is largely consistent with the
structure of recommended MFSM sectoral surveys, the institutional coverage of monetary
statistics is incomplete, and there are deficiencies in the source data arising from, inter alia,
(i) the use of different exchange rates at the CBS and at the other banks for valuing their foreign
positions; (ii) financial positions are not valued at market prices or market-price equivalents;
(iii) a number of accounting procedures for the maintenance of public sector accounts cause
distortions in the measurement of gross positions; (iv) recently established private banks as well
as banks and bank branches operating in the Free Zones are excluded from the coverage of
monetary survey; and (v) there are disparities between the institutional coverage of public sector
in monetary statistics and the government finance statistics.
10.
To address the source data deficiencies, the June 2004 multisector mission
recommended: (a) the use of a market exchange rate for valuing all foreign currency
denominated positions at all banks, including the central bank, or as an intermediate step,
the use of a single rate closest to the market rate for valuing all foreign currency positions at the
CBS and at the other banks, (b) valuation of financial positions based on market prices or
market price equivalents; (c) inclusion of recently established private banks as well as banks and
bank branches operating in the Free Zones in the coverage of the monetary survey; and (d) full
adoption of the residency principle based on the center of economic interest. Further, the
accounting procedures for the maintenance of public administrative sector’s current accounts
and the classification of the CBS’ profit advances to the government should be revised to an
outstanding stock basis (for example, by ensuring that the deposit accounts are debited for any
checks presented instead of the check amount treated as an advance and credited to a claim on
the check issuer). The institutional lists for public administrative and economic sectors should
be updated for consistency with the recommendations for the government finance statistics
made by the mission, and these lists should be used as the basis for collecting data and
compiling monetary accounts.
11.
Monthly monetary data for the IFS are reported irregularly and with a considerable lag.
As of end-June 2007, the last data reported for publication were the October 2006 data for the
central bank and the October 2005 data for deposit money banks.

10
D. Balance of Payments
12.
Annual balance of payments statistics are compiled by the CBS on a provisional basis
with about an eight-month lag. As of May 2007, the latest balance of payments statistics
reported for publication in the IFS refer to 2005. Trade data are compiled monthly by the
Customs Department and reported quarterly by the Central Bureau of Statistics in local currency
units with a six-month lag. The BOP is presented in BPM5 format, but its compilation method is
not entirely consistent with the BPM5 methodology. The June 2004 STA mission observed the
following weaknesses:
•

Private transfers do not fully reflect remittances by Syrians working abroad. The
statistics in the BOP for official transfers differ significantly from figures provided
from other sources, such as donors.

•

Data on long-term official capital inflows and amortization are not consistent with the
data provided by the MOF on the external financing of the budget deficit. Data on
private capital movements are incomplete.

•

Data on external debt continue to be incomplete, and external debt service obligations
and arrears are generally not recorded in the BOP.

•

Military imports are excluded from BOP and external debt data.

•

There is a large discrepancy between reserve flows reported in the BOP and the reserve
flows implied by the monetary survey. In particular, Net Foreign Assets (NFA) of the
banking system is much higher in the monetary survey than in the international liquidity
table derived from the balance of payments.

13.
The mission recommended the adoption of a new foreign exchange form (developed by
the mission) to improve source data and the establishment of an enterprise register to estimate
foreign direct investment. It also recommended the dissemination of international reserves and
external debt data—neither of which was disseminated for reasons of confidentiality.
14.
In February 2006, an STA assessment mission visited Damascus to assess the status of
the work program as a basis for developing a METAC technical assistance program on external
sector statistics. The mission reported minimal progress in implementing the work program and
in addressing weaknesses. The mission recommended the following five priority areas for
technical assistance:
•

compiling reliable import and export data based on information from the banking system
and data sources other than the Customs Department/CBS;

•

estimating FDI data based on information from the Ministry of Planning and/or a sample
of FDI companies;

•

implementing the new reporting form for commercial banks (to improve various
components of the BOP, specifically services);

11
•

deriving flow data from the balance sheets from commercial banks and the CBS
(financial account transactions); and

•

hands-on training for the new staff.

15.
During June 26–29, 2006 a METAC mission visited the CBS to assess progress in
developing the institutional infrastructure for compiling balance of payments statistics;
provide technical advice on implementing the international transactions reporting system
(ITRS) for commercial banks and foreign exchange bureaus; review the international
reserves data; and identify specific areas for further technical assistance in revamping the
data compilation system. At the end the mission, the CBS agreed to act on a number of
critical issues. These included (1) establishing a balance of payments division/department
with a start-up staffing of at least 6 persons and provide adequate computing resources;
(2) providing to METAC by end-August 2006, ITRS-based data reported by commercial banks;
(3) providing by end-July 2006 detailed breakdowns of the central bank balance sheet; and
(4) providing by end-July 2006, detailed bridge tables (in English and electronic) that
explains how the central bank balance sheet and the commercial banks' balance sheet are
mapped to the monetary survey.
16.
Another METAC mission visited Syria on January 18, 2007. This mission found little
progress in the implementation of previous advice. In particular, the Balance of Payments
Department is not yet created. The authorities indicated that management discussions on the
proposed structure are completed but took the view that implementing the agreed changes to the
RASD should coincide with the timing of the overall restructuring of the CBS to be completed
during 2007. On ITRS, of the initial seven banks targeted (the Commercial Bank of Syria and
six private banks), only five banks have responded, but the quality of their data is poor;
problems include lack of disaggregation, misclassifications and lack of reconciliation with data
provided in the old bank reporting form. Missing monthly reports, incomplete reporting
(missing branches) and lengthy delays in reporting result in a situation in which the CBS does
not have a consolidated ITRS report for any single month in 2006. In the event, the CBS also
took the decision not to target the banks in the free zones during 2006, and have indicated that
this would be implemented from the reporting year 2007. The authorities requested METAC’s
assistance in training banks’ staff (including those from the Commercial Bank of Syria’s
extensive branches) in completing the ITRS form. Regarding international reserves, the data are
derived from the monetary statistics, and based on the discussions, may contain foreign currency
holdings/deposits of commercial banks that are not under the control of the central bank. The
authorities agreed to provide METAC (within one week from the date of the meeting) revised
data on reserve assets, while identifying the items that were removed. The authorities have
followed up on their commitment and submitted to STA international reserves data, which are
currently being reviewed.

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2007 Article IV Consultation with the
Syrian Arab Republic
On July 30, 2007, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded the
Article IV consultation with the Syrian Arab Republic.1
Background
Over the past three years, Syria has recovered from a half decade of weak growth,
notwithstanding an unsettled regional environment and a sharp drop in oil production.
The economic recovery has gained momentum, benefiting from inflows from Iraqi refugees and
abundant liquidity in the Gulf region. Private investment has strengthened owing to an improved
business climate, and exports have made strong gains, particularly in some Arab markets,
reflecting higher demand and improved access under the Great Arab Free Trade Area. Despite
a sharp drop in oil proceeds (10 percentage points of GDP over the last three years) and the
large demand shock associated with the Iraqi refugees, inflationary pressures have been
contained, owing to the economy’s supply responsiveness and a sustained, timely and sizeable
fiscal adjustment. Public debt is still at a relatively moderate level, and the international reserves
cover remains comfortable.

1

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies.
On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the
Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the
Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the
country's authorities.

2
The near-term outlook for growth and inflation is favorable. The reforms implemented in recent
months, continued stimulus to aggregate demand from the Iraqi presence, and favorable growth
prospects both globally and in the region are expected to support consumption and non-oil
exports, and to encourage higher private investment. In 2007, these factors would help sustain
growth at about the same pace as in 2006, although deterioration in weather conditions, which
recently hit the cereal and cotton crops, may dampen growth somewhat. Fiscal policy aims to
reduce the overall budget deficit to 5 percent of GDP in 2007 (from 5.7 percent in 2006),
notwithstanding an expected further decline in oil revenues of about ¾ percentage points of
GDP. This would require a reduction in the non-oil budget deficit of some 1½ percent of GDP,
which the authorities plan to achieve through a further rationalization of capital spending. Credit
policy is expected to support the recent trend decline in inflation. The authorities intend to continue
using the exchange rate as a nominal anchor, while allowing some limited flexibility.
Significant progress has been made on the structural front over the last two years, but the
reform agenda remains substantial. Substantial progress toward exchange rate unification and
current account convertibility has been achieved; a dynamic private banking sector is now
leading financial sector growth; the investment regime has been liberalized; taxes have been
simplified and tax administration is being modernized, and the local industry has been exposed
to greater competition through several rounds of tariff cuts and a relaxation of trade restrictions.
Regulatory frameworks for banking, insurance and capital markets, and for housing and real
estate have been developed.
Executive Board Assessment
Directors noted that macroeconomic adjustment and structural reforms have helped the Syrian
economy engineer a strong rebound from the subpar growth of the previous half decade and
maintain financial stability, despite the abrupt drop in oil proceeds, the deterioration in the
regional environment, and the pressures stemming from the large inflow of refugees from Iraq.
While the short-term outlook is encouraging, the challenges posed by the further depletion of oil
reserves are daunting. Directors underscored that growth will need to be solidified, including by
persevering with quality fiscal adjustment and the steadfast implementation of the reforms
embedded in the ambitious tenth five-year development plan.
Directors commended the authorities for the sustained, timely and significant fiscal adjustment
and welcomed the lowering of corporate income taxes. They agreed that introducing a VAT and
phasing out petroleum price subsidies would provide the main pillars of the required fiscal
adjustment. A broad-based value-added tax (VAT) would have a strong revenue raising
potential with only a limited impact on production and investment. Directors observed that
phasing out petroleum price subsidies could generate significant efficiency gains and redress
part of the social inequity in the existing policy. They recommended that the authorities
accelerate the pace of tax administration reforms supporting the introduction of the VAT.
Directors commended the authorities for the significant progress toward exchange rate
unification and current account convertibility. They stressed the need to enact a new foreign
exchange law that would abrogate the existing complex set of foreign exchange laws and
regulations and enshrine full current account convertibility, and a unified exchange rate. This
would send a strong signal about the irreversibility of these reforms and the commitment of the
authorities to re-entry into the global economy. Directors felt that although the level of the real

3
exchange rate appears broadly appropriate, the impact of its recent strengthening on external
competitiveness should be monitored carefully, particularly in light of the depletion of oil
reserves and the large uncertainties about the level of the current account deficit and the
sources of its financing.
Directors welcomed the tightening of credit policy, which helped tame inflationary pressures,
despite the large demand shock from the influx of Iraqi refugees. They considered that the
adoption of a bank law that would grant the central bank operational independence in monetary
and exchange rate management would establish credibility in operating the new exchange rate
regime and strengthen the monetary policy framework. This would need to be supported by the
introduction of market-based instruments of monetary control, the centralization of official
foreign exchange reserves at the central bank, and the establishment of the long-delayed
government securities market. The process of licensing the foreign exchange bureaus and
launching an interbank foreign exchange market should be accelerated.
With respect to financial sector reform, Directors were pleased with the fast-paced expansion of
private banks. However, they were concerned about the emerging vulnerabilities and the
remaining impediments. They urged the authorities to give priority to strengthening bank
supervision capacity and to speed the process of state bank restructuring to stem further
accumulation of bad debt and allow greater competition. Directors also noted the liberalization
of the investment regime and the adoption of a modernized basic finance law.
Directors welcomed the steady progress made in trade liberalization, including the recent
publication of the tariff schedule and the unified negative list of imports. They encouraged the
authorities to further streamline the list of prohibited imports, abolish the system of industrial
quotas, reduce the number of tariff bands, and eliminate nontariff barriers. Continuing to work
on improving the business climate is essential to enhance the incentives of the private sector to
invest and to turn the promise from the surge in investment approvals into a reality.
Directors agreed that an overarching prerequisite for the success of reforms in all areas is to
strengthen domestic capacity. They encouraged the authorities to introduce a special fast-track
scheme to attract highly skilled managers and to provide intensive training to newly hired young
graduates, while continuing to work toward a far-reaching civil service reform.
Directors urged the authorities to improve the quality and timeliness of economic statistics,
especially in the external and real sector. They recommended that priority be given to improving
the balance of payments statistics to provide a sounder basis for macroeconomic management.
Public Information Notices (PINs) form part of the IMF's efforts to promote transparency of the IMF's
views and analysis of economic developments and policies. With the consent of the country
(or countries) concerned, PINs are issued after Executive Board discussions of Article IV consultations
with member countries, of its surveillance of developments at the regional level, of post-program
monitoring, and of ex post assessments of member countries with longer-term program engagements.
PINs are also issued after Executive Board discussions of general policy matters, unless otherwise
decided by the Executive Board in a particular case. The staff report (use the free Adobe Acrobat
