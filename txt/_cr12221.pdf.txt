MALAWI
Staff Report for the 2012 Article IV Consultation and Request for New Arrangement
Under the Extended Credit Facility

Prepared by the African Department
(In consultation with other departments)
Approved by David Owen and Dhaneshwar Ghura
July 10, 2012
Discussions took place in Lilongwe and Blantyre during March 19–31, 2012, and in Lilongwe during
May 23–June 6, 2012. The missions were led by Mr. T. Tsikata (AFR), and included Messrs. O. Adedeji
and M. Ghazanchyan (both AFR) and Ms. R. Randall (Resident Representative). Ms. H. Jin (AFR) and
Mr. M. Raissi (SPR) participated in the March and May/June mission, respectively. The missions met
President Bingu wa Mutharika (March), President Joyce Banda (May), Minister of Finance, Dr. Ken
Lipenga, Governors of the Reserve Bank of Malawi (RBM) Dr. Perks Ligoya (March) and Mr. Charles
Chuka (May/June), senior officials of the government and RBM, members of parliament, and
representatives of the business community, banks, civil society organizations, labor unions and Malawi’s
development partners. Ms. H. Teferra (OED) participated in the discussions and the missions were assisted
by Mr. S. Banda (Economist in the office of the IMF Resident Representative).
Staff recommends approval of the authorities’ request for a three-year arrangement under the
Extended Credit Facility (ECF) in the amount of SDR 104.1 million (150 percent of quota). The
authorities wish to cancel the three-year ECF arrangement approved by the Board in February 2010. The
program supported under that arrangement went off-track shortly after completion of the first review in
December 2010 because the authorities and staff could not reach understandings on policy measures for
2011 to achieve the key program objective of restoring external equilibrium.
The new arrangement is aimed at providing Fund support to Malawi at this critical juncture. A new
administration has taken bold upfront measures to start addressing external and internal imbalances built
up over the last few years, the result of the cumulative effects of external shocks and weak policy
response. Policy measures since April have included a large devaluation and adoption of a floating
exchange rate regime, liberalization of foreign exchange transactions, and adoption of an automatic
adjustment mechanism to keep prices of petroleum products in line with import costs. The country’s
development partners are scaling up their assistance. The program will be monitored with quarterly
reviews in the first year.
A safeguards assessment was updated in 2010. Another update is scheduled to be completed by the
first review.
The Joint IMF-World Bank Staff Advisory Note on the second Malawi Growth and Development
Strategy is being circulated to the Executive Board with this staff report.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY


President Joyce Banda, who assumed office in early April 2012 following the sudden
death of her predecessor, has moved swiftly to authorize implementation of bold
measures to address Malawi’s chronic foreign exchange shortage and to repair strained
relations with the country’s development partners. A 33 percent devaluation of the
kwacha, adoption of a floating exchange rate regime, liberalization of current account
transactions, and adoption of an automatic fuel price adjustment mechanism, have
transformed the policy environment and greatly improved the outlook for the economy.
The private sector has responded positively, and development partners have pledged a
substantial increase in grants, including assistance for social protection programs to
mitigate the adverse impact of adjustment measures on the most vulnerable segments
of the population.



The main objective of the government’s development strategy is poverty reduction
through sustained economic growth and infrastructure development. The strategy for
growth entails achievement and maintenance of macroeconomic stability and
implementation of policies and structural reforms to increase national investment and
diversify the economy in order to reduce the country’s vulnerability to external shocks.
The authorities’ policy priorities include keeping government spending within
available resources (domestic revenues and grants), tightening monetary policy to
contain inflation pressures from the depreciation of the exchange rate, and
strengthening the supervision of financial institutions.



The ECF-supported program approved by the Board in February 2010 went off-track
shortly after completion of the first review in December 2010. The new
administration requests cancellation of the current arrangement and approval of a new
three year arrangement in the amount of SDR104.1 million (150 percent of quota). Half
of the amount will be disbursed in four installments of SDR 13 million each in the first
year—the first upon approval of the arrangement, followed by three disbursements
subject to quarterly reviews. The requested level of access is twice the norm for a
country with outstanding concessional credit from the Fund in excess of 100 percent of
quota, but is justified by Malawi’s balance of payments need (very low level of
international reserves), strength of policies (including substantial upfront measures),
strong support from donors, and adequate capacity to repay the Fund.

5
I. CONTEXT: NEW COMMITMENT TO TACKLE MACROECONOMIC CHALLENGES
1.
There was a smooth transition to a new government in Malawi following the
sudden death of President Bingu wa Mutharika in early April 2012. In line with the
constitution, the then Vice President, Mrs. Joyce Banda, was sworn into office as President to
serve the remaining two years of the late president’s term.1 She announced a new cabinet of
ministers in late-April, drawn from several political parties. Mrs. Banda had fallen out with
her predecessor and been expelled from the ruling Democratic Progressive Party. She
founded her own political party, the People’s Party, in 2011.
2.
President Banda inherited an economy with a gloomy outlook. The country faced
a severe shortage of foreign exchange, which translated into shortages of critical imports
including fuel, inputs for production, and medicines. Delays in making payments abroad led
to the loss of credit lines for several businesses, resulting in scaled down operations and the
laying off of workers. Malawi’s long standing foreign exchange problems intensified in 2011
because of lower tobacco export earnings and cuts in external aid. Several donors reduced
their financial support when Malawi’s IMF-supported program went off-track in the first half
of 2011 and because of human rights and governance concerns.2 The previous
administration’s response to reduced supply of foreign exchange was a 10 percent
devaluation of the kwacha in August 2011 accompanied by tighter restrictions on foreign
exchange transactions. The restrictions created distortions which fostered the parallel market
in foreign exchange and boosted activity in the informal sector at the expense of the formal
economy.
3.
The new administration has moved swiftly to address the country’s chronic
balance of payments problems. The specific measures implemented include:


Devaluation of the exchange rate from K167 to K250 per U.S. dollar (a 33 percent
devaluation), and adoption of a floating exchange rate regime.



Allowing banks and foreign exchange bureaus to set the rate at which they buy and
sell foreign exchange from/to their customers.



Removal of the requirement for foreign exchange earnings to be surrendered to the
RBM; they now flow directly to commercial banks.



Cancellation of the requirement for banks to submit to the RBM for review any
application for external payments exceeding US$50,000.

1

2

General elections are scheduled for May 2014.

The proverbial last straw for many donors was the police crackdown on a public demonstration in July 2011
that led to the death of about 20 people.

6


Increases in prices of petroleum products to bring them in line with import costs, and
adoption of an automatic adjustment mechanism to ensure pass through of changes in
import costs to retail prices.

4.
The authorities have also tightened fiscal and monetary policies and increased
electricity tariffs toward cost-recovery levels. Specific measures have included reduction
in foreign travel by government officials, cuts in the number of vehicles available to senior
officials, and postponing new development projects that were to be financed from domestic
revenue. The RBM raised the bank rate from 13 percent to 16 percent, and has acted to mop
up excess liquidity in the banking system. The electricity tariff increases are expected to stem
operational losses of the electricity company (ESCOM).
5.
The adjustment measures are beginning to show positive results. Sales of
tobacco through official channels have increased and the private sector’s access to foreign
exchange, including for fuel imports, has eased considerably. The parallel market for foreign
exchange has almost collapsed; the exchange rate premium on that market has fallen from
60–80 percent before the devaluation to less than 5 percent. Malawi’s development partners
have welcomed the recent economic policy actions as well as the repeal of a number of laws
seen as undermining human rights and political freedoms, and have pledged increased
assistance to Malawi. External grants to the government budget are projected to increase
from US$282 million in FY2011/12 to US$481 million in FY2012/13, with general budget
support grants going from less than US$2 million to US$208 million. The Board of the
US Millennium Challenge Corporation has also announced the reinstatement of the
US$350 million grant for a Power Sector Revitalization Project aimed at improving the
availability and reliability of power supply in Malawi.3
6.
The authorities are requesting a new arrangement under the Extended Credit
Facility (ECF) and canceling the one approved in February 2010. They acknowledge
poor performance under the program supported by the current arrangement and seek a fresh
start to enable the new administration establish its own track record of policy implementation
(LOI). Performance under the program was satisfactory in 2010; the first review was
completed in December 2010 with only one waiver (related to the net domestic borrowing
target for June 2010, which was missed as a result of a temporary shortfall in foreign grants).
Discussions for the second review, initiated by a March 2011 mission, were not completed as
understandings could not be reached on policy measures for 2011 to achieve the key program
objective of restoring external equilibrium. In particular, the authorities back-tracked from
commitments to liberalize the exchange rate regime. In the event, the June 2011 quantitative
targets established at the first review were missed by wide margins.

3

The compact was signed in April 2011, placed on hold in July 2011 and formally suspended in March 2012
due to “a pattern of actions by the government of Malawi that was inconsistent with the democratic governance
criteria MCC uses to select compact partners.”

7
II. RECENT ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS
7.
Economic growth slowed significantly in 2011 after four years of very
strong performance (Figure 1). Real GDP growth slowed to 4.3 percent in 2011, from
an average annual rate of 8.3 percent during 2007–10. Sectors that are heavily
dependent on imports—manufacturing, transportation, construction, and wholesale and retail
trade—slowed down the most, reflecting the impact of the foreign exchange shortage
(Text Table). Since the mid-2000s, agriculture has been a principal engine of growth,
supported by the government’s Farm Input Subsidy Program (FISP) and good weather
conditions. Following the recent policy measures, the private sector has begun to clear the
backlog of external arrears which should help re-establish credit lines and improve the flow
of imported inputs to allow enterprises to gradually increase output from the current low
levels of capacity utilization.

8.
Inflation has been on an upswing since early 2011, with the year-on-year
headline rate jumping to 17.3 percent in May 2012 (Figure 1). Rising import costs have
been the main factor behind the upswing as a growing share of imports were being priced at
the parallel market exchange rate before the May devaluation. The devaluation triggered
large adjustments in the retail prices of petroleum products, which have had ripple effects to
other prices. The spike in inflation is expected to persist for several months but should
dissipate by early 2013 with the implementation of restrained fiscal and monetary policies to
counter the second round effects of the fuel price increases.
9.
Prior to the recent policy actions, the authorities had been inconsistent in
implementing Fund policy advice (Box 1). The government loosened its fiscal stance
significantly in the run-up to the May 2009 general elections, requiring substantial recourse
to domestic financing. After a short-lived improvement in the first year of the ECF-supported
program (FY2009/10), fiscal performance weakened as government expenditures remained
steady (in relation to GDP) while external grants fell sharply and domestic revenue

8
performance weakened. The overall fiscal deficit widened from nearly 3 percent of GDP in
FY2010/11 to an estimated 7 percent of GDP in FY2011/12, with domestic financing rising
from 1.7 percent of GDP to 5.6 percent in the respective years (Table 2b and Figure 2).
Furthermore, the government and state-owned enterprises accumulated about K72 billion
(7 percent of GDP) in domestic arrears over the last few years.
Box 1. Malawi: Main Recommendations of the 2009 Article IV Consultation
Advice

Status

Monetary and fiscal discipline needed to contain
aggregate demand and inflationary pressures.

Prudent fiscal and monetary policies were achieved
during FY 2009/10. Fiscal and monetary policies
were loosened subsequently.

Restore external equilibrium.

Inadequate policy response to adverse terms of
trade and aid shocks fostered a parallel foreign
exchange rate market with large premiums over the
official exchange rate.

Enhance Public Financial Management.

A Public Financial and Economic Management unit
has been established in the Ministry of Finance.
Progress is being made in improving the budget
process, accounting and fiscal reporting.

Rely more on interest rate adjustments to help control
inflation.

Cost considerations limited RBM’s monetary
operations. Recently, there is renewed commitment
to undertake open market operations.

Strengthen supervision of financial institutions.

Significant progress has been made, including the
effective use of risk-based supervision and putting
in place stress-testing techniques for banks.

10.
Until recently, fiscal policy tended to dominate monetary policy. The RBM
accommodated the government’s financing requirements, while cost considerations held it
back from conducting open market operations to mop up excess liquidity. Growth in reserve
money and broad money have been driven by RBM lending to the government and credit to
the economy, respectively (Tables 4a and 4b, and Figure 3). The RBM began tightening its
policy stance in April 2012 when it off-loaded some of its holdings of treasury bills. In May
it raised the policy rate and, after the devaluation, used foreign exchange sales to further mop
up excess liquidity. Kwacha liquidity conditions tightened significantly and several banks
resorted to the RBM discount window to meet their needs.
11.
The current account balance (including transfers) has fluctuated widely, driven
mainly by aid flows and terms of trade (Figure 4). Increased grants helped narrow the
current account deficit in 2009 and 2010, while adverse terms of trade and cuts in grants

9
contributed to a widening in 2011. The country’s high dependence on fuel and fertilizer
imports, tobacco exports and aid inflows render it highly vulnerable to external shocks.
International reserves have been very low—hovering around one month of imports for much
of the last three years and about half a month of imports more recently—and so have not
provided much of a buffer against adverse shocks. Pronounced seasonality in foreign
exchange inflows also complicate monetary and international reserve management.4
III. MEDIUM-TERM FRAMEWORK
12.
The main objective of the government’s development strategy is
poverty reduction through sustained economic growth and infrastructure development
(MEFP ¶10). The government has formally approved the second Malawi Growth and
Development Strategy (MGDS II) covering 2011/12–2015/16, the successor to the first
MGDS which covered 2006/07–2010/11. A key element of the strategy for achieving
sustainable growth articulated in both documents is the pursuit of sound economic policies
with a view to maintaining inflation at single digit levels and increasing the level of
international reserves. An increase in national investment, including in electricity generation
and supply, transportation and irrigation, and in selected priority sectors (agriculture,
manufacturing, mining, and tourism), is expected to deliver high growth, while prudent fiscal
and monetary policies deliver low inflation.5 MDGS II is designed to help Malawi achieve
the Millennium Development Goals (MEFP ¶ 12, and Table 10).
13.
Improvements in the business regulatory environment and investments to
address supply-side bottlenecks are expected to boost foreign direct investment in
mining, manufacturing and tourism. New mines in rare earth metals are expected to start
operations beginning in 2013. In the manufacturing sector, there has been significant
interest in agro-processing activities from foreign and domestic investors. The promotion of
high-quality tourism facilities is a key goal of the MGDS. The construction sector is also an
important source of growth in the medium term, as construction activities grow in line with
increased public and private investment.
14.
The program for which the authorities are seeking support under the ECF is
based on MGDS II. Specific objectives of the program include achievement and
maintenance of a stable macroeconomic environment with low inflation, increasing foreign
exchange reserves, and undertaking structural reforms to improve the investment climate and
promote sustained and inclusive growth (MEFP ¶13). Key features of the medium-term
macroeconomic framework are:

4

5

Inflows from tobacco sales tend to be concentrated in April–September.

MGDS II and an accompanying Joint Staff Advisory Note is being circulated to the Executive Board with this
staff report.

10


A rebound in growth from 4.3 percent in 2012 to 5.7 percent in 2013 and to at least
6½ percent per year from 2015.



Year-on-year inflation rises to about 23 percent in December 2012, and declines
gradually thereafter to single-digit levels in 2014.



No net domestic financing of the government budget on an annual basis; any
borrowing in the early part of the year would be repaid by the end of the year.



The level of useable international reserves increases gradually from one month of
import cover at end-2012 to 3 months of imports by end-2015.

15.
The design of the program was informed by the recent Ex Post Assessment of
Malawi’s Longer-Term Program Engagement (EPA).6 The EPA found that the Fund’s
engagement with Malawi helped the country maintain macroeconomic stability during most
of the period under review (2004–11), but that weak ownership of policies led to setbacks in
the last few years. It concluded that there is a case for continued Fund program relations with
Malawi—given the country’s weak balance of payment position—but recommended that
such engagement take place only if the authorities have “firm ownership” of program
commitments. In terms of program objectives and content, the EPA emphasized the need to
go beyond macroeconomic stability to address constraints to growth and the need for a
stronger social safety net.
16.
The new administration has demonstrated strong ownership of key policies. The
rapid implementation of the exchange rate related measures—some of which would have
been prior actions for the new ECF arrangement—as well as politically unpopular but
fiscally sound measures such as increases in petroleum products and electricity tariffs,
provide strong and credible evidence of the new authorities’ commitment to implementing
appropriate policies to tackle Malawi’s long-standing economic challenges. Staff encouraged
the authorities to be more proactive in explaining the rationale of policy decisions to the
public, with emphasis on the expected benefits from new measures and the costs of inaction.
The authorities have begun to do this as demonstrated by a recent two-page insert in
newspapers on the FY2012/13 budget proposals which highlighted the pro-poor measures in
the budget as well as the alignment of expenditure allocations with government priorities.
17.
Program design also reflected the findings of an updated debt sustainability
analysis (DSA) carried out jointly by staffs of the IMF and the World Bank.7 Malawi’s
risk of external debt distress remains moderate. The country’s narrow export base, reliance
on rain-fed agriculture and low international reserves make it susceptible to shocks. Stress

11
tests highlighted the vulnerability to an export shock. With respect to the public debt
component of the DSA, stress tests indicated a need for fiscal consolidation to slow down
growth in the domestic debt stock.
IV. POLICIES AND STRUCTURAL REFORMS
18.
Policy discussions revolved around measures to contain inflation and achieve a stable
macroeconomic environment, alignment of the government budget to MGDS II priorities,
and structural reforms to boost inclusive growth. Staff emphasized the role of fiscal
discipline and tight monetary policy to ensure that the recent nominal depreciation of the
exchange rate translated into a sustained real depreciation to achieve the expected positive
effects on the balance of trade and growth. Given the recent history of fiscal dominance, the
discussions on monetary policy emphasized the need for increased operational independence
of the RBM. Staff also noted that more consistent implementation of prudent fiscal and
monetary policies are likely to increase aid flows and make them more stable and
predictable. This should allow room for the authorities to build up international reserves to
provide a buffer against adverse external shocks.
A. Exchange Rate Policy and Regime
19.
Malawi had a de facto peg to the U.S. dollar for most of the period since 2004.
The official exchange rate was allowed to depreciate gradually for a few months each in the
run-up to: (i) the 2005–08 PRGF arrangement; (ii) the HIPC completion point in 2006; and
(iii) the 2010–13 ECF arrangement. The kwacha depreciated by about 13, 12, and 7 percent
respectively in those episodes. In addition, the kwacha was devalued by 10 percent in August
2011. Notwithstanding the authorities’ stated objective (including in MGDS I) of
implementing a flexible exchange rate regime, in practice they sought to keep it virtually
fixed against the U.S. dollar, but expansionary fiscal and monetary policies undermined the
de facto peg and combined with exchange restrictions to foster the parallel foreign exchange
market. Based on the changes introduced in May 2012, Malawi now has a floating exchange
rate regime.
20.
Staff estimates the real effective exchange rate (REER) of Malawi to have been
substantially overvalued before the devaluation in May 2012. CGER-type methodologies
and a time series approach suggest misalignment of around 34 percent (Appendix II).
Widespread rationing of foreign exchange and the size of the parallel market premium (about
80 percent) support the indication of significant misalignment. Continued large inflation
differentials with main trading partners meant that significant nominal depreciation was
needed to reduce the overvaluation. The 33 percent devaluation of the exchange rate and
adoption of a floating regime in May 2012 brought the exchange rate broadly into line with
fundamentals.
21.
The authorities have agreed to a review by Fund staff to determine whether the
exchange system complies with Malawi’s obligations under Article VIII of the Fund’s

12
Articles of Agreement. Malawi accepted these obligations in 1995. Staff is in the process of
reviewing recent reforms to make an assessment of Malawi’s exchange system.
B. Fiscal Discipline to Support Exchange Rate Regime and Key Priorities
22.
The government’s efforts to achieve fiscal sustainability over the medium term
are built on measures to strengthen domestic revenue mobilization, restrain growth in
expenditures, and reduce domestic debt:


Domestic revenue mobilization efforts include removal of implicit subsidies on fuel
and an associated boost in fuel tax revenues, and strengthening of revenue
administration through increased audits, adoption and use of electronic fiscal devices
in the enforcement of VAT, and the use of computerized cargo scanners.



Expenditures will be aligned to MGDS II priorities, with increased allocations to the
Agriculture, Education, and Health sectors.



After the rapid buildup in the stock of domestic debt and expenditure arrears in the
last few years, the government’s medium-term expenditure framework is anchored by
an annual target of zero net domestic borrowing in order to lower domestic debt to
sustainable levels.

23.
The fiscal deficit is projected to fall from 7 percent of GDP in 2011/12 to about
1 percent in 2012/13, reflecting a large increase in grants. The increase in grants
(from 5.5 to 10.4 percent of GDP) reduces the domestic financing requirement while
allowing the government to scale up social protection programs to mitigate the impact of
adjustment measures on the poor. This is reflected in an increase in recurrent expenditures of
about 2 percent of GDP. Programs that receive substantially higher allocations compared to
FY2011/12 include the Farm Input Subsidy Program (FISP), public works, school feeding,
school bursary, and cash transfer programs (MEFP ¶18). The social sectors (mainly
education and health) receive a higher share of expenditures, reflecting not only the increased
spending on social protection programs but also to allow for hiring more teachers and health
workers.
24.
A sizeable revenue effort and tight control of spending will be needed to ensure
that expenditures are aligned with the government’s top priorities. Domestic revenues
(tax and non tax revenue) are projected to increase by about 1.3 percent of GDP in
FY2012/13, mainly reflecting the reform of the pricing and taxation of petroleum products
(MEFP ¶16). On the expenditure side, the government has established clear priorities in some
of the largest ministries (Agriculture, Education and Health) with assistance from the World
Bank. Quarterly spending ceilings will be established and enforced to keep expenditures
within the available resource envelope (MEFP ¶18).
25.
Domestic arrears will be subject to verification and the government will tighten
its control over expenditure commitments (MEFP ¶20). The Office of the Auditor

13
General will verify the arrears and the verified amount will be paid over several years.
Implementation of the commitment module in the IFMIS will be accelerated to help prevent
accumulation of new arrears. The government will inform the general public of its
procurement rules through the media, including warnings that those who provide goods or
services outside of the established government system will not be paid.
26.
The government has initiated steps to reduce the risks to the budget posed by
contingent liabilities and operational losses of state owned enterprises (MEFP ¶21). The
National Oil Company of Malawi will be limited to its core activity of managing strategic
reserves of fuel. The government has established a clear regulatory regime for the electricity
that provides for tariff adjustments to cover ESCOM’s operating costs. A similar regime will
be established for the Water Boards in order to eliminate the need for budgetary transfers and
to minimize recourse to commercial bank borrowing.
C. Enhancing Monetary Policy Effectiveness
27.
The authorities emphasized the importance of price stability, sufficient credit to
the private sector and accumulation of international reserves. To help manage domestic
demand and contain inflation, broad money is programmed to grow at about the pace of
nominal GDP in the near term. Further financial deepening in the medium term would allow
broad money to grow faster than nominal GDP without fueling inflation. The RBM will use
all available instruments to achieve the above objectives, including open market operations
and changes in the bank rate. The RBM and the Ministry of Finance are to enhance
coordination to ensure adequate sharing of information to provide a more solid basis for
RBM’s liquidity forecasts that guide its monetary operations. For now, the RBM will mainly
rely on its holdings of treasury bills to conduct monetary operations.
28.
The authorities agreed with staff on the need to strengthen the operational
independence of the RBM. They are requesting technical assistance from the Fund on
options to provide resources to the RBM for its monetary operations (MEFP ¶25). Two main
options are under consideration: (i) issuance of new treasury bills for monetary operations
with the Ministry of Finance carrying the interest costs; and (ii) issuance of an income
generating security to the RBM with the RBM bearing the cost of its monetary operations. As
an additional measure to strengthen the RBM’s operational independence, the authorities
have agreed to amend the RBM Act to place a limit on the government’s total borrowing
from the RBM (MEFP ¶26). The current Act has a limit on overdrafts but not on other forms
of RBM lending to the government.
D. Safeguarding Financial Sector Stability
29.
Financial stability indicators suggest that the banking sector in Malawi remains
sound. Non-performing loans are at low levels, but the deterioration in the macroeconomic
environment in the last two years has elevated the risks to banks’ portfolios. The RBM has
intensified its monitoring and surveillance of the financial system with a view to detecting at

14
an early stage emerging threats to financial stability. The RBM is establishing Basel II
governance structures and committees, with full compliance with Basel II principles
envisaged for January 2014.
30.
The authorities consider the financial sector as critical to achieving inclusive
growth. Indicators of financial deepening in Malawi, while improving, are still low by
regional standards (Appendix III). Staff welcomes various initiatives being pursued by the
government to deepen the financial sector, including the establishment of credit reference
bureaus (MEFP ¶28), the development of a National Strategy for Financial Inclusion (MEFP
¶30) and the establishment of the Malawi Financial Sector Deepening Trust (MFSDT)
(MEFP ¶30). These initiatives are in line with the recommendations of the 2008 Financial
Sector Assessment Program (Box 2).
E. Improving International Competitiveness
31.
A number of indicators of external competitiveness suggest that Malawi is
lagging behind its neighbors. Concentration in the production of tobacco, which accounts
for over 60 percent of total exports, and a handful of other cash crops (e.g., sugar and tea), as
well as maize (produced primarily for domestic consumption) point to an undiversified
economy. Malawi’s export growth has been stymied relative to that of other regional peers,
while imports have accounted for a larger and growing share of GDP—a clear manifestation
of the impact of Malawi’s chronic exchange rate misalignment. Malawi’s share of regional
exports to the world has also declined sharply over time, and the country ranks behind its
neighbors in indicators of the business environment such as business operating conditions
and business transaction costs (Appendix II). In view of the push toward greater regional
integration (including the Grand Tripartite Free Trade Area encompassing COMESA, EAC,
and SADC), the government is determined to address these competitiveness issues, including
through the adoption of a National Export Strategy (MEFP ¶¶32–33). There are also ongoing
efforts to address key supply-side bottlenecks in the energy sector (e.g., the MCC compact
and the Interconnector Project with Mozambique).
F. Data Quality and Dissemination Issues
32.
In order to safeguard the integrity of revenue data, the government has
decided that the MRA should publish its monthly revenue collections in the local media
with a lag of no more than a month. The Minister of Finance recently acknowledged
that, under the previous administration, his ministry inflated revenue data for the first half of
this fiscal year (July–December 2011) that was reported to parliament in February 2012. In
late-December 2011, the Ministry of Finance (MoF) realized that revenues were unlikely to
meet a target set by the late President. Senior officials of MoF authorized the Malawi
Revenue Authority (MRA) to obtain short-term loans from several banks which were
deposited into the MRA account at the RBM to “boost” revenues. The loans were repaid in
the first few days of January 2012.

V. PROGRAM ISSUES
33.
The authorities are requesting an access level equivalent to 150 percent of quota
for the new three-year ECF arrangement. This is higher than the norm of 75 percent of

16
quota for such arrangements for countries with outstanding concessional credit from the Fund
in excess of 100 percent of quota. Malawi currently has outstanding obligations to the Fund
equivalent to 135 percent of quota. The case for the higher-than-usual level of access is based
on the country’s balance of payments need, the strength of the program (including bold
upfront measures already implemented), strong donor support, and adequate capacity to
repay the Fund:


International reserves are at a precarious level, at only ½ a month of import cover.
The authorities have been careful not to accumulate official external payments arrears
but estimate that the private sector has accumulated arrears of more than
US$300 million (equivalent to about 15 percent of projected imports in 2012). The
resources from the Fund would enable the RBM to gradually rebuild gross reserves to
1 month of imports by end-2012 and to 3 months by end-2015 (Table 4a). The net
resources from the Fund will account for only one-quarter of the reserve
accumulation (Table 5). One donor (DFID) has brought forward some of its planned
disbursements in order to help alleviate the precarious international reserves position
of the RBM.



The program to be supported by the new ECF arrangement is strong. As indicated
above, the authorities have already implemented bold upfront measures and have
made clear and highly credible commitments to pursue prudent fiscal and monetary
policies to consolidate the expected gains from the exchange rate adjustment.



The program is expected to catalyze donor support. Notwithstanding the high level
of access, Malawi’s external financing requirement remains high and the need for
substantial donor support remains strong (Table 5). Representatives of donors have
assured staff that funds held back when the ECF-supported program went off-track
will be restored. Other donors who cut aid because of concerns about human rights
and political governance issues have also signaled their intention to provide increased
support in response to the repeal of laws that were widely seen as curtailing the
freedom of citizens.

34.
Malawi has adequate capacity to meet its financial obligations to the Fund
(Table 7). Because of relatively large payments due to the Fund from Malawi in 2014 and
2015, the full disbursement of the proposed level of access would take the country’s
projected level of credit to the Fund from 135 percent of quota at present to 225 percent of
quota at end-2015. If disbursements are made as scheduled, there will be a peak in debt
service to the Fund in 2018 at US$34.1 million (or 1.5 percent of exports of goods and
services). The country has an established record of timely servicing of its obligations to the
Fund, and the DSA places Malawi at a moderate risk of debt distress. Fund support will be a
relatively small part of the overall financing package, as Malawi is projected to receive an
average of US$200 million per year in budget support, seven-eighths of which is in the form
of grants, and the rest in the form of highly concessional loans. More broadly, Malawi

17
receives around US$500 million per annum in official grants, three-quarters of which goes
through the budget. The strong level of donor support, combined with the prospects for future
development of Malawi’s export potential are expected to support Malawi’s capacity to repay
the Fund.
35.
Phasing, program reviews and conditionality. It is proposed to front load
disbursements, with 75 percent of quota in the first year (Table 6), given the low levels of
international reserves and the strong upfront actions taken by the authorities. There will be
quarterly reviews in the first year; if all goes well, this will change to half-yearly reviews in
subsequent years. A prior action requiring parliamentary passage of a budget for FY2012/13
that is in line with program objectives has been met. The program has quantitative
performance criteria on NDA of the central bank, NIR, central government net domestic
borrowing, limits on nonconcessional external borrowing, and limits on the accumulation of
external payments arrears (Table 8). It also has the standard continuous performance criteria,
including the criterion on non-imposition or intensification of restrictions on the making of
payments and transfers for current international transactions, and indicative targets on
spending on the social sectors (including all the main social protection programs) and on
reserve money. Adjustors will allow for increased expenditure if additional budget support
grants become available, but there will be only limited and temporary substitution of
domestic financing for shortfalls in budget support. Structural benchmarks have been set
mainly in the PFM and financial sector areas (Table 9).
36.
An update safeguards assessment of the RBM with respect to the 2012 ECF
arrangement has been initiated and will be completed by the first review. The latest
safeguards assessment was completed on June 25, 2010 and concluded that the RBM
continued to have strong financial safeguards in the areas of external audit and financial
reporting. The main area of concern was the lack of adequate autonomy for the RBM, which
is now being addressed by the program. Another key recommendation is related to the
strengthening of foreign reserves management oversight.
37.
Risks from global spillovers. Downside risks to the program include potential
spillovers from the global economy, including stagnation of euro area and world growth, a
substantial fall in non-oil commodity prices, and a reduction in aid flows. Slower world
growth would adversely affect demand for Malawi’s exports (mainly tobacco), but the
overall impact on Malawi’s growth is expected to be low, because of the authorities active
efforts to diversify export markets (including to China). A substantial fall in tobacco prices
would adversely affect export proceeds, the income of farmers and dampen growth. Given
the size of tobacco in the economy (15 percent of GDP), the expected impact would be
moderate. The risk of lower aid flows is low. Most of the major donors have indicated to
staff that they would be prepared to scale up their support to Malawi if the government
continues to implement appropriate economic policies and there is no deterioration in human
rights and political governance. However, with the EU as one of the major donors, it is

18
conceivable that over the medium-term aid to Malawi might decline because of shrinking aid
budgets in Europe.
38.
Other risks. Adverse weather conditions and slippages in the implementation of
economic reforms also pose risks to the program. Adverse weather conditions pose a
significant risk because of the continued reliance on rain-fed agriculture. Lower agricultural
output would have a significant effect on overall GDP growth given the size of agriculture in
GDP (30 percent). Slippages in policy implementation and structural reforms could lead to
another cut in aid flows. Under the program, reductions in general budget support grants have
to be offset by expenditure cuts (mainly in goods and services). It is important to avoid fiscal
and monetary laxity in the run-up to the elections in 2014, in order to build credibility for
Malawi’s commitment to the implementation of prudent policies. Furthermore, failure to
improve Malawi’s relatively poor track record in implementing structural reforms would
dampen the country’s prospects for long-term growth and reducing vulnerability to shocks.
VI. STAFF APPRAISAL
39.
Policy actions by the new administration led by President Banda have
significantly improved the outlook for the economy. The new government moved swiftly
to implement policies to address Malawi’s chronic balance of payments problems and
improve the growth outlook. The 33 percent devaluation of the kwacha, adoption of a
floating exchange rate regime, and liberalization of current account transactions have halted
the economy’s slide toward export and output contraction. The liberalization of the foreign
exchange regime will help remove distortions and encourage private investment and
diversified growth.
40.
Fiscal discipline and tight monetary policy are needed to ensure that the recent
nominal depreciation of the exchange rate translates into a sustained real depreciation.
Staff welcomes the measures adopted by the government to ensure that total spending stays
within the resource envelope of domestic revenues and grants. In order to ensure that
spending is in line with the government’s priorities, the authorities need to strengthen
commitment control and enforce procurement rules. On the revenue side, the increase in the
retail prices of petroleum products and the re-introduction of an automatic adjustment
mechanism provide a robust base for government tax revenues. The authorities should avoid
fiscal and monetary laxity in the run-up to the elections in 2014, to build credibility for
Malawi’s commitment to the implementation of prudent policies.
41.
Staff welcomes the positive response of Malawi’s development partners to the
recent economic policy changes and to the steps taken by the authorities to address the
governance and human rights concerns that led some partners to withhold financial
assistance from the country in FY2011–12. Substantially higher grants in FY2012/13
should allow the government to boost spending on social protection programs to mitigate the
impact of the adjustment measures on the most vulnerable segments of the population. Over
the medium term, the government needs to consider ways of ensuring the sustainability of the
Farm Input Subsidy Program, one of the largest social protection programs.

19
42.
Staff also welcomes recent measures by the RBM to tighten monetary policy.
After many years of fiscal dominance, the RBM has begun to show signs of operational
independence. It increased the policy rate and has undertaken open market operations to mop
up excess liquidity. Staff urges the government to strengthen the balance sheet of the RBM to
enable it meet its primary mandate of maintaining price stability.
43.
The authorities are to be commended for their multifaceted approach to
promoting inclusive growth. Their efforts include initiatives to deepen the financial system
and make it more inclusive, and measures to enhance the investment climate and
international competitiveness by addressing key supply-side bottlenecks such as those related
to energy and transportation infrastructure.
44.
Staff supports the authorities’ request for a new three-year arrangement under
the ECF. In view of Malawi’s large balance of payments need and the strong upfront
measures already implemented by the authorities, staff also supports the requested level of
access in the amount of SDR104.1 million (150 percent of quota), with half of the amount
disbursed in four installments in the first year. The unusually high access level addresses the
country’s balance of payments need, while keeping the Fund’s exposure to a manageable
level.
45.
Staff recommends that the next Article IV Consultation with Malawi take place
within 24 months, in accordance with the Decision on consultation cycles for program
countries.

APPENDIX I. LETTER OF INTENT
July 9, 2012
Madam Christine Lagarde
Managing Director
International Monetary Fund
Washington, D.C. 20431
USA
Dear Madam Lagarde:
1.
Malawi recently underwent a peaceful transition in leadership following the
unexpected death of President Bingu wa Mutharika. On April 7, 2012, the then vice
President, Mrs. Joyce Banda, was sworn into office as President. President Banda has formed
a new cabinet in which she appointed ministers from different political parties.
2.
In February 2010, the Executive Board of the IMF approved a three-year Extended
Credit Facility (ECF) arrangement for Malawi for an amount of SDR 52.05 million
(75 percent of quota). The program supported by this arrangement went off-track shortly
after completion of the first review in December 2010, reflecting a lack of progress in
implementing policy commitments under the program to adopt a flexible exchange rate
regime and liberalize current account transactions in line with Malawi’s obligations under
Article VIII of the IMF Articles of Agreement.
3.
The government of Malawi wishes to cancel the current ECF arrangement, which is
due to expire in February 2013, effective as of July 23, 2012. In its place, we request a new
three-year ECF arrangement to support our medium term economic objectives and policy
framework for the fiscal years 2012/13 through 2014/15 (July 2012–June 2015). The
new arrangement will provide the administration of President Banda a clean slate on which to
re-establish Malawi’s credibility in implementing sound economic policies. Already, within
the short time it has been in office, President Banda’s administration has implemented all the
exchange rate related measures committed to, but not implemented, by the previous
administration. In particular, the kwacha was devalued substantially and has been allowed to
float.
4.
In view of our large and urgent balance of payments need and the strength of our
program, we request access of SDR 104.1 million (150 percent of quota), including a first
disbursement of SDR13.02 million upon approval of the arrangement by the IMF’s
Executive Board. This arrangement will support our medium-term program to address
balance of payments weaknesses and to achieve poverty reduction through sustained privatesector-led growth and wealth creation. Re-establishing a close engagement with the IMF will
send a positive signal to domestic stakeholders and our development partners regarding our
determination to maintain macroeconomic stability in order to create an environment that is

38
conducive for sustained growth and poverty reduction. To this end, we request quarterly
reviews of program implementation in the first year of the arrangement.
5.
In the attached Memorandum of Economic and Financial Policies (MEFP), we set out
our macroeconomic framework for FY2012/13–FY2014/15, including the policies we intend
to implement to achieve our objectives. Specific emphasis is placed on rebuilding
international reserves, improving public financial management and fiscal transparency,
operational independence of the Reserve Bank of Malawi, and improving the investment
climate and the country’s international competitiveness.
6.
The MEFP and Technical Memorandum of Understanding (TMU) present
quantitative performance criteria, indicative targets, and structural benchmarks to be used to
monitor implementation of the program. We believe that the policies set forth in the MEFP
are adequate to achieve the objectives of the program, but we will take any further measures
that may become appropriate for this purpose. We will consult with IMF staff on the
adoption of these measures, and in advance of revisions to the policies contained in the
MEFP, in accordance with the IMF policies on such consultation. Moreover, we will provide
the IMF with such information as the IMF requests in connection with the progress in
implementing the policies and reaching the objectives of the program.
7.
The Government of Malawi authorizes the IMF to make this letter and the attached
MEFP and TMU available to the public, including through the IMF internet website.
Yours sincerely
/s/
Dr. Ken Lipenga (MP)
Minister of Finance

/s/
Mr. Charles Chuka
Governor of the Reserve Bank of Malawi

ATTACHMENT I.
MALAWI: MEMORANDUM OF ECONOMIC AND FINANCIAL POLICES, 2012/13–2014/15
I. Introduction
1.
This memorandum summarizes the objectives and policies of the government of
Malawi’s economic program for July 2012–June 2015, for which the government is seeking
support from the International Monetary Fund through a new three-year arrangement under
the Extended Credit Facility (ECF). The new arrangement will succeed the one approved by
the IMF’s Executive Board in February 2010. The program supported by that arrangement
went off-track shortly after completion of the first review in December 2010, on account of
challenges we had in implementing our commitments under the ECF-supported program,
including adopting a flexible exchange rate regime and liberalizing payments for current
account transactions. The main objective of the program to be supported by the new
arrangement is achievement and maintenance of macroeconomic stability in order to provide
a suitable environment for sustained growth, wealth creation and poverty reduction.
2.
Following the sudden death of President Bingu wa Mutharika in early April 2012,
Mrs. Joyce Banda (Vice President at the time) was sworn into office as President to serve the
remainder of the term of the late President, in accordance with Malawi’s constitution.
General elections are scheduled to be held in May 2014. President Banda formed a new
government with the announcement of her cabinet ministers in late-April 2012. The new
administration inherited a very difficult economic situation, marked by a severe shortage of
foreign exchange which led to shortages of critical imports including fuel, inputs for
production and medicines. Delays in making payments abroad led to the loss of credit lines
for several businesses, resulting in scaled down operations and the laying off of workers.
Malawi’s long standing foreign exchange problems intensified in 2011 because of lower
tobacco export earnings and the interruption of the ECF-supported program with the IMF
which led several donors to cut their general budget support grants to Malawi.
3.
Within a month of taking office, the new administration implemented a set of bold
measures to address Malawi’s chronic balance of payments difficulties and to halt the
slowdown in economic activity arising from the shortages of foreign exchange and critical
imports. The implemented measures included all the commitments the government had made
under the ECF-supported program to adjust the official exchange rate and liberalize the
exchange regime for current account transactions, non-implementation of which led to the
interruption of the program. The recently implemented measures include:


Devaluation of the exchange rate from K167 to K250 per U.S. dollar, and adoption of
a floating exchange rate regime.



Allowing banks and foreign exchange bureaus to set the rate at which they buy and
sell foreign exchange from/to their customers.

40


Removal of requirement for foreign exchange earnings to be surrendered to the RBM;
they now flow directly to commercial banks.



Cancellation of requirement for banks to submit to the RBM for review, any
application for external payments exceeding US$50,000.



Substantial increase in fuel prices to bring them in line with true import costs, and
restoration of an automatic adjustment mechanism to ensure that retail prices reflect
changes in world prices.



Substantial increases in electricity tariffs to ensure movement toward cost recovery.



A tightening of monetary policy to contain inflationary pressures, signaled by the
RBM raising its policy rate from 13 percent to 16 percent.

4.
The adjustment measures are beginning to show positive results. Sales of tobacco
through official channels have increased, suggesting a decline in smuggling of the crop to
neighboring countries; the parallel market for foreign exchange has almost collapsed, with
premiums over the official exchange rate falling from 60–80 percent before the devaluation
to 5–10 percent, while rates offered by banks and foreign exchange bureaus are converging;
and the private sector’s access to foreign exchange has eased considerably. The government
is working with the World Bank and other partners to scale up social protection programs to
mitigate the adverse effects of the adjustment measures on the welfare of the most vulnerable
segments of the population.
5.
The administration of President Banda has also moved swiftly to repair strained
relations with Malawi’s development partners and neighboring countries. Parliament has
revoked a number of laws that were widely seen as undermining human rights and political
freedoms, which were of concern to civil society organizations in Malawi and to major
donors. Donors have responded positively to the reforms being implemented by the new
administration. Based on information from donors, we project external grants to increase
from US$281.5 million in FY2011/12 to US$480.5 million in FY2012/13, with general
budget support grants going from less than US$2 million to US$208 million. Normalization
of relations with neighboring countries is also bearing fruit: the government has signed a
Memorandum of Understanding with Mozambique to resuscitate the electricity
Interconnector Project which is expected to ease Malawi’s electricity shortages in the short to
medium term. The government has also been able to recover its maize loan to Zimbabwe
through an exchange with petroleum products.
II. RECENT DEVELOPMENTS AND THE NEAR TERM OUTLOOK
6.
Economic growth slowed significantly in 2011. After averaging over 8 percent a year
during 2007–10, real GDP grew at 4.3 percent in 2011. Sectors that are heavily dependent on
imports—manufacturing, transportation, construction, and wholesale and retail trade

41
sectors—slowed down the most, reflecting the impact of the foreign exchange shortage.
Following the recent policy measures, the private sector has began to clear the backlog of
external arrears which should help re-establish credit lines and improve the flow of imported
inputs to allow enterprises to gradually increase output from the current low levels of
capacity utilization.
7.
Inflation has been on a rising trend since early 2011, with the year-on-year headline
rate reaching 12.4 percent in April 2012 and jumping to 17.3 percent in May 2012. Rising
import costs have been the principal factor behind the upswing as a growing share of imports
were being priced at the parallel market exchange rate before the May devaluation, and the
devaluation triggered large adjustments in the retail prices of petroleum products which have
ripple effects to other prices. The spike in inflation is expected to persist for a few months but
should be reversed with implementation of restrained fiscal and monetary policies.
8.
Fiscal performance improved in FY2009/10 (the first year of the ECF-supported
program) but deteriorated thereafter as government expenditure remained steady (in relation
to GDP) while external grants fell sharply and domestic revenue performance deteriorated.
The government relied heavily on domestic financing of its growing deficit. The overall
fiscal deficit widened from nearly 3 percent of GDP in FY2010/11 to 7 percent in
FY2011/12, with domestic financing rising from 1.7 percent of GDP to 5.6 percent in the
respective years. The government and state owned enterprises have also accumulated about
K72 billion in domestic arrears over the last few years. The new administration has taken
steps to restrain spending, including by reducing the number of official trips abroad, cutting
the number of vehicles available to senior officials, and postponing new development
projects which were to be funded entirely by domestic resources.
9.
Monetary developments in the last few years reflect a dominant influence of fiscal
policy. The RBM accommodated the government’s financing requirement and cost
considerations held it back from conducting open market operations to mop up excess
liquidity. Growth in both reserve money and broad money has trended upwards since mid2010. At end-April 2012, reserve money and broad money grew at year-on-year rates of
47 percent and 31 percent, respectively. The RBM began tightening its policy stance in April
2012, including by removing excess liquidity using some of its holdings of treasury bills. In
May the RBM raised its policy rate from 13 percent to 16 percent, and after the devaluation,
used foreign exchange sales to further mop up excess liquidity. Kwacha liquidity conditions
tightened significantly and several banks resorted to the RBM discount window to meet their
needs.
III. The Medium-Term Framework
10.
The medium-term framework for Malawi’s economic development policies is set out
in the second Malawi Growth and Development Strategy (MGDS II) which was approved by
the government in April 2012. It covers the period 2011/12–2015/16, and has the same main

42
objective as the first MGDS (2006–11), i.e., to achieve poverty reduction through sustainable
growth and infrastructure development. A key element of the strategy for achieving
sustainable economic growth is the pursuit of sound economic policies with a view to
maintaining inflation at single digit levels and increasing the level of international reserves.
An increase in national investment—with emphases in areas such as electricity generation
and supply, transportation and irrigation, and in selected priority sectors (agriculture,
manufacturing, mining, and tourism)—is expected to deliver high growth, while prudent
fiscal and monetary policies deliver low inflation.
11.
The macroeconomic framework in MGDS II needs updating in light developments
since the document was completed in early 2011. The annual growth rate which was
expected to average over 7 percent a year is now projected to rise gradually from 4.3 percent
in 2012 to 6.7 percent in 2016. Similarly, the annual rate of inflation which was projected to
decline from 8.7 percent to 5.9 percent over the five years covered by the strategy, is now
expected to reach 23 percent in December 2012 and then fall to 6 percent by the end of 2016.
The government will present updated medium-term outlooks in annual reports on MGDS
implementation.
12.
MGDS I and II were designed to move Malawi towards achievement of the
Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). The 2011 MDG report shows remarkable progress
toward achieving five out of the eight MDGs: (i) eradicating extreme poverty and hunger;
(ii) reducing child mortality; (iii) combating HIV and AIDS, malaria and other diseases;
(iv) ensuring environmental sustainability; and (v) enhancing global partnership for
development. MDGS II contains measures to accelerate progress toward achievement of the
three MDGs for which Malawi is lagging behind: (i) universal primary education; (ii) gender
equality and empowerment of women; and (iii) improvement in maternal health.
13.
Recent economic developments have underlined Malawi’s susceptibility to external
shocks. Adverse terms of trade developments and a marked reduction in aid inflows
contributed to the severe foreign exchange shortage in the country in 2011 and the first half
of 2012. However, overvaluation of the kwacha has also been an important factor in the
country’s weak balance of payments position, with growth of imports outpacing that of
exports. The recent devaluation and floating of the kwacha will help address this imbalance
by boosting exports and slowing down growth in imports (especially of consumer goods).
Against this background, the key medium-term objectives of our ECF-supported program
include:


Recovery in real GDP growth from 4.3 percent in 2012 to about 6½ percent per year
in the medium term.



Achieving and maintaining a stable macroeconomic environment with low inflation,
founded on sustainable fiscal and external balances.

43


Increasing foreign reserves coverage to three months of imports, to provide a buffer
against exogenous shocks (e.g., weather, terms of trade, and aid flows).



Enhancing the operational independence of the RBM.



Pursuing reforms to deepen the financial sector and promote greater financial
inclusion.



Undertaking structural reforms to improve the investment climate and promote
sustained and inclusive growth, including through improvements in infrastructure and
regulatory reforms.

14.
In the last five years, agriculture has been the main engine of growth, supported by
the government’s Farm Input Subsidy Program (FISP) and good weather conditions. The
floating of the kwacha and liberalization of the foreign exchange regime is expected to foster
growth over the medium term by redirecting resources to exports and import-competing
production, while containing import demand. In the near term, growth will come mainly from
the sectors that were hardest hit by the foreign exchange shortages, including manufacturing,
transportation service, construction, and trade, as production levels increase toward capacity.
Other sectors, including agriculture, will also benefit from the easing of fuel shortages. Over
time, growth is expected to be led by mining and non-traditional agricultural exports
(including through enhanced value addition in the form of agro-processing).
IV. Policies
Fiscal Policies and Related Structural Reforms
15.
The FY2012/13 budget is anchored by a zero net domestic borrowing target in order
to begin to reduce domestic debt to sustainable levels. This represents a sharp reduction from
about 5.6 percent of GDP domestic borrowing in FY2011/12. In consultation with IMF staff
and other development partners, the Ministry of Finance established a realistic resource
envelope that formed the basis for expenditure plans in the FY2012/13 budget. Substantially
higher donor support in the form of grants and concessional loans reduce the domestic
financing need, but a sizeable revenue effort and tight control of spending will be needed to
ensure that expenditures are aligned with the government’s top priorities, including
safeguarding social safety net provisions.
16.
The government is committed to strengthening its revenue mobilization efforts in
order to reverse the recent marked decline in domestic revenue in relation to GDP. The
largest contribution to increased revenue is expected to come from fuel taxes. This reflects a
change in the pricing and taxation of petroleum products from a system that implicitly
subsidized retail prices by foregoing revenue to one based on the actual cost of imports and
adoption of an automatic adjustment mechanism to ensure that retail prices reflect changes in
import costs. A number of tax measures introduced last year which turned out to be punitive

44
on businesses and regressive in nature and which did not yield as much revenue as expected
are being repealed in order to help improve the business climate. At the same time, the range
of items subject to VAT is being expanded and excise duties are being harmonized with
regional partners.
17.
The government will enhance its enforcement mechanisms through increased audits
and use of modern ICT systems to improve revenue collection. Tax revenues are expected to
improve through the adoption and use of electronic fiscal devices in the enforcement of VAT
and the use of computerized cargo scanners coupled with the implementation of web-based
ASYCUDA System for Customs. With respect to nontax revenues, the government will
continue enhancing its oversight function through monitoring and auditing of the various
revenue collecting institutions to ensure transparency and accountability in the management
of departmental receipts collected from user fees and charges.
18.
Reflecting government’s top priorities, the FY2012/13 budget increases the share of
total expenditures allocated to social protection programs, most notably the FISP. Other
programs that will be scaled up include public works, school feeding, school bursary, and
cash transfers. Responsibility for these programs span several ministries and departments but
the Ministries of Agriculture, Education and Health which bear most of the responsibilities
have received the largest increases in resources. With assistance from World Bank staff, the
government has established priorities in three of the largest Ministries—Agriculture,
Education and Health—to guide budget execution. In order to instill fiscal discipline and
signal a change from the loose fiscal policy stance of the last year, the Ministry of Finance
will establish and enforce quarterly spending limits on all ministries, departments and
agencies (MDAs), consistent with estimated available resources. The limits for the first
quarter will be announced shortly after the budget is approved by parliament, and limits for
subsequent quarters will be informed by revenue performance to date and by the outlook for
grants, and will be announced in the last month of the preceding quarter. The Ministry of
Finance will report to cabinet every quarter on how the system is working.
19.
The budget provides increased resources to wages and salaries and interest payments.
The nominal wage bill was increased by 30 percent over the projected outturn for FY2011/12
to accommodate a 21 percent pay increase to government employees and allow additional
hiring of staff in the education and health sectors. Interest costs are projected to increase
although there will be no net domestic borrowing for the year as a whole. A tightening of
monetary policy by the RBM is expected to push up interest rates, and increase the cost of
rolling over maturing treasury bills.
20.
Over the last three years, government ministries and departments as well as parastatal
organizations accumulated domestic arrears of about K72 billion (7 percent of GDP).
Government intends to verify these arrears through the Office of the Auditor General, before
making plans to settle them. In the 2012/13 budget, a provision of K10 billion has been made
for the settlement of some of the arrears. It is expected that it will take 3 to 4 years to clear

45
the arrears. Government will also look at some alternatives such as raising funds through
long-term Treasury Bonds to settle some of the bills. In order to strengthen commitment
control and avoid the accumulation of arrears, the government will accelerate implementation
of the commitment module in the IFMIS. The government will inform the general public of
its procurement rules through the media. It will include warnings that those who provide
goods or services to MDAs outside of the established government system will not be paid.
21.
The government has initiated steps to reduce the risks to the budget posed by
contingent liabilities and operational losses of state owned enterprises. The contingent
liabilities are mainly loans from banks and payment arrears while the operational losses arise
from administratively set prices and tariffs that are below cost recovery levels and generate
substantial implicit and explicit subsidies. The government recognizes that the operations of
the recently established National Oil Company of Malawi (NOCMA), including government
guaranteed loans for fuel imports, pose severe risks to the budget. In order to minimize these
risks, NOCMA will be limited to its core activity of managing strategic reserves of fuel. The
bulk of fuel importation for regular use will revert to the private sector.
22.
The government through the Malawi Energy Regulatory Authority (MERA) has
established a clear regulatory regime for the Electricity Supply Corporation of Malawi, Ltd.
(ESCOM) that covers operating costs and avoids the need for budgetary transfers and that
minimizes recourse to commercial bank borrowing. A similar regime will be established for
the Regional Water Boards. This will enable the utilities with a view to enabling them to
invest in needed capital infrastructure to improve the quality, availability, and reliability of
their service delivery, with a view to supporting the expansion of economic activities.
Monetary Policy in a Floating Exchange Rate Regime
23.
Monetary policy will be geared toward achieving price stability, while providing
room for sufficient credit to the private sector and supporting a buildup of international
reserves. Broad money will be the nominal anchor, with reserve money as an intermediate
target. To help manage domestic demand and contain inflation, broad money is programmed
to grow at about the pace of nominal GDP in the near term. Further financial deepening in
the medium term would allow broad money to grow faster than nominal GDP without fueling
inflation.
24.
The RBM has a liquidity forecasting framework which it uses to guide monetary
operations. The RBM will continue to develop its instruments of indirect monetary control
and strengthen its ability to implement monetary policy through changes in interest rates,
underpinned by open market operations. To that end it will welcome technical assistance
from the IMF, drawing on the experiences of other countries, and focusing on practical
advice on enhancing the operational framework, including open market operations of varying
maturity profiles, combined with the use of reserve averaging and standing facilities.

46
25.
The RBM is reviewing options for obtaining resources for conducting open market
operations without being constrained by cost considerations. It is requesting technical
assistance from the IMF to complete the review and decide on the way forward. Possible
options include: (i) issuance of treasury bills (over and above government financing needs)
for monetary operations, with the Ministry of Finance carrying the interest costs; and
(ii) issuance of an income generating security to the RBM, with the RBM bearing the cost of
its monetary operations.
26.
The RBM is also undertaking a review of the RBM Act with a view to recommending
amendments to modernize it. Proposed amendments will be ready for discussion with
government by December 2012, and for submission to parliament by the government by
June 2013. In order to enhance the operational independence of RBM, the government agrees
to include an amendment to limit the outstanding amount of the government’s total
borrowing of all kinds from RBM. Currently, the RBM Act limits the amount of advances to
the government but has no limits on other forms of RBM lending to the government
(e.g., through holdings of treasury bills).
Financial Sector Reforms
27.
Financial stability indicators suggest that the banking sector in Malawi remains
sound. Non-performing loans are at low levels—their share as a ratio of total loans was about
4 percent in 2011. However, the deterioration in the macroeconomic environment in the last
two years has elevated the risks to banks’ portfolios. The RBM has intensified its monitoring
and surveillance of the financial system with a view to detecting at an early stage emerging
threats to financial stability. The RBM has adopted a risk-based supervision approach to
examining bank performance and is working with banks to enhance their stress-testing
capacities and practices. The RBM currently compiles the results of its stress-testing of banks
on a semi-annual basis and will begin publishing the report of its analysis starting with the
report for end-March 2012, which will be published by end-July 2012. The RBM is
establishing Basel II governance structures and committees, with full compliance with Basel
II principles envisaged for January 2014.
28.
Two credit reference bureaus are currently operating in Malawi. These bureaus,
underpinned by sound legal and regulatory framework for the sharing of credit information,
should bring down the cost of lending by lowering credit risks through easier identification of
sound borrowers.
29.
The RBM is strengthening its supervision of nonbank financial institutions. Two
departments have been established for this purpose; one focusing on pension and insurance
sectors and the other on microfinance. Extending the supervisory framework to the non-bank
institutions would help ensure an equal playing field for all participants in the financial
market and prevent a situation where risks are built up in the non-bank financial sector.

47
30.
To deepen financial intermediation and ensure financial inclusion, government has
developed a financial sector strategy and launched a National Strategy for Financial
Inclusion. The financial sector strategy is envisaged for cabinet approval by end-December
2012. The World Bank, through technical assistance, continues to provide support towards
achieving the attainment of inclusive finance for growth and financial deepening and
competiveness. Ensuring increased access of the population (including small- and mediumsized enterprises (SMEs)) to finance is critical for expanding production and job creation and
key to the attainment of the overarching goal of inclusive growth.
31.
With the support of development partners, the government is in the process of
establishing the Malawi Financial Sector Deepening Trust (MFSDT). The trust will support
the development of financial markets in Malawi as a means to stimulate wealth creation and
reduce poverty. Working in partnership with the financial services industry, the Trust will be
used to significantly expand access to financial services among lower-income households
and small and medium-sized enterprises both in urban and rural areas. The trust will operate
independently under the supervision of professional trustees, with policy guidance from a
program investment committee (consisting of representatives of donors and the government).
Enhancing International Competitiveness
32.
A number of indicators of external competitiveness suggest that Malawi is lagging
behind its neighbors in this dynamic region of sub-Saharan Africa. Our share of regional
exports to the world has declined sharply over time, and we rank behind our neighbors in
indicators of the business environment such as transactions costs and infrastructure. In view
of the push toward greater regional integration (including the Grand Tripartite Free Trade
Area encompassing COMESA, EAC, and SADC), the government is determined to address
these competitiveness issues. Although the recent liberalization of the exchange rate
regime has addressed the issue of overvaluation of the kwacha, a key step towards
enhancing Malawi’s international competitiveness, the government recognizes that further
steps are required, especially removal of structural bottlenecks—e.g., reliable and adequate
supply of energy—that are holding back growth and diversification of the economy.
33.
The government is developing a National Export Strategy (NES) through a
participatory process involving a broad range of stakeholders. The NES seeks to transform
Malawi from being a predominantly importing and consuming nation to becoming a
producing and exporting nation. The NES will prioritize investment incentives to develop
productive capacity, encourage foreign and domestic investment and ultimately create
sustainable export capacity. The investment incentives for enhancing export capacity will
focus on areas that contribute towards inclusive growth and have extensive forward and
backward linkages in the economy, especially through potential for value addition. The NES
takes a long run view of building productive capacity and has a 10–15 year horizon and
builds upon and synchronizes a number of existing government policies, frameworks and
initiatives. The NES is expected to be launched in the second half of 2012.

48
Information Sharing, Data Quality and Capacity Building
34.
In order to enhance economic policy making, we will adopt processes and practices to
improve real time information sharing among departments in the Ministry of Finance
(Revenue, Expenditure, Debt and Aid Management, Economic Affairs), and between the
Ministry of Finance and the RBM. This will involve more effective use of the Integrated
Financial Management Information System (IFMIS) and is expected to improve the quality
of public finance data. The Ministry of Finance (Treasury) will provide more timely
information on government operations to the RBM to help the latter conduct more effective
liquidity management and foreign exchange operations.
35.
In view of the recent revelation of reporting of inflated revenue data to parliament,
the government has decided that the Malawi Revenue Authority should publish its monthly
revenue collections in the local media with a lag of no more than a month.
36.
The government is grateful for the assistance it has received from the IMF and other
partners to build capacity for the compilation and dissemination of economic statistics. We
continue to need assistance to improve the quality of a wide range of statistics, including
national accounts, prices, and the balance of payments. We are also in need of assistance to
build capacity for the production of high frequency indicators of economic activity to guide
timely policy making.
V. Program Monitoring
37.
Program implementation will be monitored with quantitative financial targets and
structural benchmarks (see Tables 1 and 2 below), and quarterly reviews in the first year of
the program and semi-annual reviews thereafter. Definitions of key concepts and indicators,
as well as reporting requirements, are set out in the accompanying Technical Memorandum
of Understanding. The first review is scheduled to be completed by mid-December 2012
based on the end-September 2012 test date and the second review by mid-March 2013 based
on the end-December 2012 test date. Performance criteria are also being established for endMarch 2013 and end-June 2013.
38.
Performance criteria will be set on: (i) net domestic assets of the RBM; (ii) net
international reserves of the RBM; (iii) net domestic borrowing by the central government;
(iv) new non-concessional external loans contracted or guaranteed by the central
government; and (v) accumulation of external arrears by the government or RBM. There are
also continuous performance criteria which include the criterion on non-imposition or
intensification of exchange restrictions on the making of payments and transfers for current
international transactions (in line with Malawi’s obligations under Article VIII of the IMF’s
Articles of agreement). In addition, there are indicative targets on reserve money and on
government expenditure on the social sectors and social protection programs. The program
also contains a set of structural benchmarks to underpin fiscal discipline and monitor

49
structural reforms in the areas of public financial management, operational independence of
the RBM, and financial system stability.
39.
The RBM stands ready to undergo a safeguards assessment before the completion of
the first review under the new ECF arrangement.

ATTACHMENT II. TECHNICAL MEMORANDUM OF UNDERSTANDING (TMU)
I. INTRODUCTION
1.
This memorandum sets out the understandings between the Malawian authorities and
the International Monetary Fund regarding the definitions of quantitative performance
criteria, benchmarks, and indicative targets for the program supported by the ECF
arrangement, and the related reporting requirements.
2.
Coverage: The central government includes all units of government that exercise
authority over the entire economic territory. However, in contrast to the System of
National Accounts 1993 (SNA 1993) and Government Finance Statistics Manual 2001
(GFSM 2001) standards, nonprofit institutions that are controlled and financed by the central
government are excluded for purposes of this memorandum. The accounts of the monetary
authorities include those of the RBM. Monetary aggregates under the program are based on
the twelve-bank monetary survey.
II. QUANTITATIVE PERFORMANCE CRITERIA: DEFINITIONS AND DATA SOURCES
A. Floor on Net International Reserves of the RBM
3.
Definition of net international reserves (NIR) of the RBM: The NIR of the RBM
is defined as gross reserves minus IMF and other short-term liabilities. The values of all
foreign assets and liabilities will be converted into U.S. dollars at each test date using the
program cross exchange rates for the various currencies and then converted into kwacha
using the program exchange rate for the U.S. dollar–kwacha exchange rate. The program
exchange rate of the Malawi Kwacha to the U.S. dollar is set at MK260 = US$1. The
corresponding cross exchange rates and program gold price for the duration of the program are in
Table 3.
4.
Gross reserve assets of the RBM are defined in the International Reserves and
Foreign Currency Liquidity Guidelines for a Data Template as external assets immediately
available and controlled by RBM “for meeting balance of payments financing needs, for
intervention in exchange markets to affect the currency’s exchange rate, and for other related
purposes (such as maintaining confidence in the currency and the economy, and serving as a
basis for foreign borrowing).” (BPM6, paragraph 6.64).
5.
This concept includes the following: (1) monetary gold holdings of the RBM;
(2) holdings of SDRs; (3) the reserve position in the IMF; (4) foreign convertible currency
holdings; (5) deposits held in foreign central banks, the Bank for International Settlements,
and other banks; (6) loans to foreign banks redeemable upon demand; (7) foreign securities;
and (8) other unpledged convertible liquid claims on nonresidents. It excludes the following:
(1) any foreign currency claims on residents; (2) capital subscriptions in international
institutions; (3) foreign assets in nonconvertible currencies; (4) transfers of foreign currency

51
claims to RBM by other institutional units in Malawi just prior to reporting dates with
accompanying reversals of such transfers soon after those dates; (5) gross reserves that are in
any way encumbered or pledged, including, but not limited to: (i) assets blocked when used
as collateral for third party loans and third-party payments, pledged to investors as a
condition for investing in domestic securities, and (ii) assets lent by RBM to third parties that
are not available before maturity, and are not marketable.
6.
Gross reserve liabilities of the RBM are defined as the sum of the following:
(1) SDR allocations; (2) outstanding medium and short-term liabilities of the RBM to the
IMF; and (3) all short-term foreign currency liabilities of the RBM to nonresidents with an
original maturity of up to, and including, one year.
7.
Definition of budget support: Budget support includes all grants and foreign
financing not directly linked to additional budgetary expenditure. Excluded from this
definition is external project financing to fund particular activities, including food security
funding from the European Union and loan financing from the IMF, and donor inflows
(in kwacha) from the U.S. dollar–denominated donor pool accounts for the health SWAp,
education SWAp, agricultural SWAps, and National AIDS Commission (NAC) held in the
Malawi banking system.
8.
Adjustment clause on NIR—budget support: The floor on the NIR of the RBM
will be adjusted upward by the full amount by which the cumulative receipts from the budget
support are greater than US$30 million above the program baseline (See Table 1). The floor
on NIR of the RBM will be adjusted downward by the full amount up to a maximum of
US 10 million by which the cumulative receipts from the budget support are less than the
program baseline. Budget support is measured as the cumulative flow from the beginning of
the fiscal year.
9.
Adjustment clause on NIR—donor accounts for the social sector (including health,
education, and other SWAps, and National AIDS Commission (NAC): The floor on the NIR
of the RBM will be adjusted downward by the amount by which the donor inflows (in
kwacha) from the U.S. dollar–denominated donor accounts for SWAps and NAC held in the
RBM are smaller than the donor inflow (in kwacha) to those accounts in the program
baseline. The downward adjustment will be capped at US$ 30 million. Donor inflows are
measured as the receipts (in kwacha) by the budget from the beginning of the fiscal year.
10.
Adjustment clause on NIR—debt service payments: The floor on NIR of the RBM
will be adjusted upward (downward) by the full cumulative amount by which debt service
payments to the World Bank and the African Development Bank (ADB) fall short of
(exceed) the program baseline. The cumulative amount will be measured from the beginning
of the fiscal year.
11.
The total downward adjustment to NIR from a shortfall of (i) budget support and
(ii) donor inflows to the donor accounts for the social sector relative to the program

52
assumptions, and (iii) an excess of debt service payments to the World Bank and the African
Development Bank (ADB) relative to the program assumptions will be capped at
US$40 million. The floor on the NIR of the RBM will be adjusted upward by the full amount
by which the cumulative receipts from the budget support are greater than US$30 million
above the program baseline and by the full cumulative amount by which debt service
payments to the World Bank and the African Development Bank (ADB) fall short of the
program baseline.
12.
For this target and those for external debt and arrears, valuation will be in U.S.
dollars, using the above defined program exchange rates.
13.
Data on NIR, including its components, will be reported by the RBM on a weekly and
end-month basis.
B. Ceiling on the Net Domestic Assets of the Reserve Bank of Malawi and Reserve
Money
14.
Definition of net domestic assets (NDA) of the RBM: NDA of the RBM are defined
in kwacha terms as end-quarter reserve money less NFA of the RBM at the program
exchange rate. Reserve money consists of currency issued by the RBM and balances of
commercial banks’ accounts with the RBM. It includes required reserves held for Malawi
kwacha deposits and any other domestic currency reservable liabilities and other demand and
time deposits held with the RBM. The NDA program ceilings are the indicative money
targets defined below less the NFA of the RBM.
15.
Definition of NFA of the RBM: The NFA of the RBM are defined as the abovedefined NIR plus other foreign assets of the RBM—including but not limited to: (1) capital
subscriptions in international institutions; (2) foreign assets in nonconvertible currencies; and
(3) gross reserves that are in any way encumbered or pledged, less any medium- and longterm foreign liabilities of the RBM.
16.
Adjustment clause on NDA—budget support: The ceiling on NDA of the RBM
will be adjusted downward by the full amount by which the cumulative receipts from the
budget support are greater than US$30 million above the program baseline. The ceiling on
NDA of the RBM will be adjusted upward by the amount by which the cumulative flow of
receipts from budget support are less than the program baseline, up to a maximum of
$30 million. The kwacha value of the cumulative shortfall (excess) will be calculated at the
program exchange rate. Budget support is measured as the cumulative flow from the
beginning of the fiscal year.
17.
Adjustment clause on NDA—donor pool accounts for the social sector
(including health, education, and other SWAps, and NAC): The ceiling on NDA of the
RBM will be adjusted upward by the amount by which the donor inflows (in kwacha) from
the U.S. dollar–denominated donor accounts for the SWAps and NAC held in the RBM fall

53
short of the donor inflow (in kwacha) to those accounts in the program baseline. The upward
adjustment will be capped at US$30 million. Donor inflows are measured as the receipts
received (in kwacha) by the budget. Donor inflows are measured from the beginning of the
fiscal year.
18.
Adjustment clause on NDA—debt service payments: The ceiling on NDA of the
RBM will be adjusted downward (upward) by the full cumulative amount by which debt
service payments to the World Bank and the ADB falls short of (exceeds) the program
baseline (Table 1). The cumulative amount will be measured from the beginning of the fiscal
year.
19.
The total upward adjustment to NDA from a shortfall of (i) budget support (ii) donor
inflows to the donor accounts for the social sector relative to the program assumptions and
(iii) an excess of debt service payments to the World Bank and the African Development
Bank (ADB) relative to the program assumptions will be capped at US$40 million. The
downward adjustment to NDA will reflect the full amount by which the cumulative receipts
from the budget support are greater than US$30 million above the program baseline and by
the full cumulative amount by which debt service payments to the World Bank and the
African Development Bank (ADB) fall short of the program baseline.
20.
Adjustment clause on NDA—liquidity reserve requirement: The ceiling on NDA
of the RBM will be adjusted downward for a decrease in the reserve requirement ratio on
domestic deposits, and will be adjusted upward for an increase in the ratio. The adjustment
will be spread equally over two quarters, starting in the quarter in which the reserve
requirement ratio is reduced. The adjuster will be calculated as follows: (one minus the
existing required percentage of reserve assets) multiplied by (the program baseline required
reserve ratio minus the new required reserve ratio) multiplied by (the amount of average
reservable deposit liabilities in commercial banks during the last month before the change in
regulation).
C. Ceiling on Central Government Net Domestic Borrowing (CGDB)
21.
Definition of CGDB: CGDB is computed as the sum of (1) net borrowing from the
RBM (including ways and means advances, loans, holdings of local registered stocks,
government bonds, and holdings of treasury bills minus deposits); (2) net borrowing from
commercial banks (including advances, holdings of local registered stocks, and holdings of
treasury bills minus deposits); (3) net borrowing from nonbanks (including, but not limited
to, holdings of local registered stocks and holdings of treasury bills); and (4) holdings of
promissory notes. The treasury bills and locally registered stocks are valued at cost rather
than face value. The ceiling is measured as the change in the stock of CGDB since June 30,
2012, including promissory notes and securities transferred to the RBM from the treasury
since the beginning of the fiscal year. Transfers from extra-budgetary funds will not be
considered revenues for this performance criterion. They will be treated the same as
borrowing from the private sector (as their accounts are outside the definition of government)

54
and therefore as domestic borrowing. Asset sales or privatization revenues will be accounted
for under financing as a separate category, separate from domestic or foreign financing in
calculating CGDB.
22.
Definition of domestic arrears: Domestic arrears are overdue payment obligations
of the central government other than external payment arrears, including on wages and
salaries, pensions, transfers, domestic interest, goods and services, obligations arising from
court cases, legally established compensation claims, and tax refunds. Payments on wages
and salaries, pensions, transfers, court-established obligations, and compensations are in
arrears when they remain unpaid for more than 30 days beyond their due date. Domestic
interest payments are in arrears when the payment is not made on the due date. Payments for
goods and services are deemed to be in arrears if they have not been made within 90 days of
the date of invoice, or—if a grace period has been agreed—within the contractually agreed
grace period.
23.
Adjustment clause on CGDB—budget support: The ceiling of CGDB will be
adjusted downward (upward) by the full amount by which cumulative kwacha receipts from
budget support are greater (less than) the program baseline. The upward adjustment will be
capped at US$30 million. In the event of excess budget support, the ceiling on CGDB will be
adjusted by the full amount less US$30 million. The kwacha value of the cumulative shortfall
(excess) will be calculated at the program exchange rate. Budget support is measured as the
cumulative flow from the beginning of the fiscal year.
24.
Adjustment clause on CGDB—donor accounts for the social sector
(including health, education, and other SWAps, and NAC): The ceiling on CGDB will be
adjusted upward by the full amount by which the donor inflows (in kwacha) from the
U.S. dollar–denominated donor accounts for health, education, and other SWAps, and NAC
held in RBM are smaller than the donor inflows (in kwacha) to those accounts in the program
baseline. The upward adjustment will be capped at US$30 million. Donor inflows are
measured as receipts received (in kwacha) by the budget. Donor inflows are measured from
the beginning of the fiscal year.
25.
Adjustment clause on CGDB—debt service payments: The ceiling (floor) on
CGDB will be adjusted downward (upward) by the full cumulative amount by which debt
service payments to the World Bank and the ADB fall short of (exceed) the program
baseline. The cumulative amount will be measured from the beginning of the fiscal year.
26.
The total upward adjustment to CGDB from a shortfall of (i) budget support
(ii) donor inflows to the donor accounts for the social sector relative to the program
assumptions and (iii) an excess of debt service payments to the World Bank and the African
Development Bank (ADB) relative to the program assumptions will be capped at
US$[40] million. The downward adjustment to NDA will reflect the full amount by which
the cumulative receipts from the budget support are greater than US$30 million above the

55
program baseline and by the full cumulative amount by which debt service payments to the
World Bank and the African Development Bank (ADB) fall short of the program baseline.
D. Ceiling on External Payment Arrears
27.
Definition of external payment arrears: External payment arrears consist of debtservice obligations (principal and interest) of the central government or the RBM to
nonresidents that have not been paid at the time they are due, as specified in contractual
agreements, except on external debt subject to rescheduling or restructuring. This
performance criterion will be monitored on a continuous basis.
E. Ceiling on Nonconcessional External Debt
28.
Definition of nonconcessional external debt: The definition of debt, for the purpose
of the limit, is set out in Executive Board Decisions No. 6230-(79/140) August 3, 1979, and
as amended by Decisions No. 11096-(95/100), October 25, 1995; 12274–(00/85) August 24,
2000; and 14416-(09/91), August 31, 2009. For program purposes, short-, medium-, and
long-term debt is nonconcessional if it includes a grant element of less than 35 percent, as
indicated in Decision No. 11248-(96/38), April 15, 1996. The ceiling on nonconcessional
debt applies to the contracting and guaranteeing of debt with nonresidents by the central
government, the RBM, public enterprises, and other official sector entities, unless an explicit
selective exclusion is made. This performance criterion is monitored on a continuous basis.
The ceiling applies to debt and commitments contracted or guaranteed for which value has
not been received. The ceiling is measured cumulatively from the beginning of the fiscal
year.
29.
less.

Short-term debt: Outstanding stock of debt with an original maturity of one year or

30.
Medium- and long-term debt: Outstanding stock of debt with a maturity of more
than one year.
31.
Excluded from the limit is the use of IMF resources, and any kwacha-denominated
treasury bill and local registered stock holdings by nonresidents. Excluded from the limit
are also (i) debts classified as international reserve liabilities of the RBM; (ii) new debt
issued to restructure, refinance, or repay existing debt up to the amount actually used for the
above-mentioned purposes; (iii) normal import financing; and (iv) arrangements to pay
overtime obligations arising from judicial awards to external creditors. A financing
arrangement for imports is considered to be “normal” when the credit is self-liquidating.

56
III. QUANTITATIVE INDICATIVE TARGETS AND STRUCTURAL BENCHMARKS
32.
Definition of reserve money: Reserve money is defined as the sum of currency
issued by the RBM, including the vault cash of commercial banks, and balances of
commercial bank accounts with the RBM. It includes required reserves held for kwacha
deposits, other domestic currency liabilities, and other demand and time deposits held with
the RBM. The reserve money targets are the projected end-quarter values starting with endSeptember r 2012 to end-December 2013.
33.
Definition of social spending: Using functional classification of expenditure, social
spending is computed as the sum of central government spending on health, education, the
farm input subsidy program, and government social protection (comprising the government
expenditures by the ministry of gender, children and social welfare, the ministry of disability
and elderly affairs, and the local development fund) . In order to maintain Malawi’s
commitment and progress toward poverty reduction and the MDGs, the social spending
allocations in the government budget will not be adjusted downward to meet fiscal targets of
the program (Table 4).
IV. REPORTING OF CERTAIN TRANSACTIONS IN THE FISCAL ACCOUNTS
34.
Donor pool–funded expenditures in support of the SWAps: The Government of
Malawi has embarked on an integrated program of service delivery in the health and
education sectors (the so-called SWAps). In support of the health and education SWAps,
some donors pool resources (the donor pool), and release these resources through normal
government procedures (i.e., recurrent budget or development Part II budget) to the relevant
sector. Financial flows into and out of this account will be reported on a monthly basis from
the beginning of the fiscal year.
35.
Farm input subsidy program: The government has embarked on a program of
subsidizing agricultural inputs, in particular, fertilizer, to smallholder farmers to improve
agricultural production, financed by the budget. The spending on the farm input subsidy
program will be reported quarterly from the beginning of the fiscal year.
V. EXCHANGE REGIME
36.
Avoiding multiple currency practices and exchange restrictions: The RBM will
ensure on-going assessment of the foreign exchange regime with support from IMF to ensure
the consistency of the regime with Malawi’s obligations under Article VIII. The RBM will
continue to work towards ensuring that the spread between the official exchange rate and
other market determined rates (bureau and parallel market rates) fall within 2 percent. The
RBM will abide by the continuous PC on non-introduction or intensification of exchange
restrictions and multiple currency practices.

57
VI. REPORTING REQUIREMENTS
37.
Monitoring of the program requires that the information listed in Table 5 below be

APPENDIX II. MALAWI: REAL EXCHANGE RATE ASSESSMENT1

This note assesses the degree of exchange rate misalignment in Malawi until May 2012,
using four approaches: macroeconomic indicators pertaining to the foreign exchange
market, two model-based approaches derived from the established methodology of the
Consultative Group on Exchange Rates (CGER), and a high frequency time-series
equilibrium real exchange rate (ERER) estimation. All four approaches point to real
exchange rate overvaluation in Malawi prior to the change in the monetary regime. We
suggest that the assessment of real exchange rate misalignment in Malawi rely primarily on
indicators that capture developments in the foreign exchange market, complemented by
model-based approaches, especially the ES and ERER techniques. This assessment is a
backward looking exercise based on April 2012 WEO data and prior to the exchange rate
regime changes in Malawi. The 33 percent devaluation of the exchange rate and adoption of
a floating regime in May 2012 brought the exchange rate broadly in line with fundamentals.
I. INTRODUCTION
1.
Evaluating a country’s macroeconomic performance and the sustainability of its
policies require an assessment of its competitiveness. Among other elements, such an
assessment entails an analysis of real exchange rate misalignment. Assessing whether a
country’s real exchange rate deviates from its equilibrium helps to ascertain the need for
policy adjustment.
2.
The empirical study of real exchange rate misalignments in low-income
countries (LIC) presents a number of conceptual and methodological challenges. These
include: (i) financing constraints that limit the ability of LICs to smooth consumption in the
face of unanticipated shocks. The LICs usually receive significant amounts of grants,
concessional loans, and remittances whose timing may be determined by donors; (ii) the
existence of tightly-managed exchange rates and poorly diversified export structures, leading
to a significant exposure to terms of trade shocks; (iii) a high degree of cross-country
heterogeneity between the LICs and other developing/developed countries; and (iv) poor data
with significant structural breaks in macroeconomic series.
3.
This note assesses the magnitude of the exchange rate misalignment in Malawi
using a combination of relevant macroeconomic indicators and model-based
approaches, suitably adjusted to capture the relevant features of the Malawian
economy and data constraints. We use the macroeconomic indicators pertaining to the
foreign exchange market, and three model-based approaches: external sustainability (ES);
macroeconomic balance (MB); and the (reduced form) equilibrium real exchange rate

64
(ERER). The ES and MB approaches focus on current account misalignment and the required
exchange rate adjustments that will ensure consistency between the underlying current
accounts and the associated norms. The time-series ERER approach, on the other hand,
estimates a cointegrating relationship between the real exchange rate and the commodity
terms of trade in Malawi and then directly compares the actual real effective exchange rate
series (REER) with the predicted one from the model to establish the magnitude of the real
exchange rate misalignment.3
4.
We make several adjustments to the standard MB framework. First, we use a
homogenous group of African countries with similar characteristics to Malawi to calculate
the current account norm and the equilibrium exchange rate misalignment, using data over
the period 2002–11 to avoid the structural breaks in the data series. Second, we augment the
determinants of the current account with terms of trade, aid flows, and remittances, to reflect
specific characteristics of a LIC like Malawi. Third, we employ an econometric technique
that captures the potential endogeneity of the variables and exploits the panel nature of the
data.
5.
The macroeconomic indicators approach points to excess demand for foreign
exchange and the model-based approaches indicate a real exchange rate overvaluation
in the range of 26 to 34 percent. The assessment of real exchange rate misalignment in
countries with foreign exchange rationing (which are therefore persistently on the supply
curve for foreign exchange and off their demand curve) is especially difficult, because the
equilibrium is not found within the data. In addition, using estimated coefficients from a
panel of countries that are in different stages of development compared to Malawi may bias
the results. We therefore base the analysis for Malawi on indicators that capture
developments in the foreign exchange market, complemented by model-based approaches,
especially the ES and ERER techniques.
6.
This note is organized as follows. Section II discusses the macroeconomic indicators
that capture developments in the foreign exchange market and external sector. Section III
discusses the application of the ES approach to Malawi, bringing out the relevant
justifications for the relevance of using this approach. Section IV presents both the MB and
ERER approaches, with a succinct description of the adjustments made to the standard
CGER methodology and an explanation of the time series approach adopted. Section V
concludes the note and derives policy implications.

3

Isard (2007) argues that the three approaches are complementary, as they explicitly or implicitly model the
medium run equilibrium value of the real effective exchange rate from different perspectives. These three
approaches in conjunction with country-specific information can help reach robust assessments.

65
II. MACROECONOMIC INDICATORS APPROACH: RECENT DEVELOPMENTS IN THE
EXTERNAL SECTOR AND FOREIGN EXCHANGE MARKET
A. External Sector Developments
7.
Recent evolution of the REER in Malawi has been associated with changes in the
terms of trade (Figure A2.1a). Importantly, however, due to restrictive foreign exchange
policies, recently REER has been much more stable than the terms of trade; therefore the
measured and equilibrium real effective exchange rates have started to diverge. This is an
important observation, because looking at the trend in the REER alone might suggest that the
exchange rate is moving in line with the fundamentals. The persistent overvaluation leads to
current account deficits, complicating the accumulation of foreign exchange reserves
(Figure A2.1b) and could thus eventually lead to a full-blown balance of payments crisis, if
not offset by adequate capital flows (Imam, 2008).
8.
Other external sector indicators point to a weak balance of payments position.
The rapid growth of domestic incomes and broadly fixed exchange rate between the
Malawian Kwacha and the U.S. dollar have culminated in an imbalance between the growth
of imports and exports (Figure A2.1c) and resulting in volatile current account deficits
(Figure 1d). Export growth has shown a declining trend, which makes it difficult to finance
imports, including the essential ones such as fuel, fertilizer and medicine. After narrowing
significantly in 2010, reflecting the shifting of delayed external grants from 2009 to early
2010, current account deficit has increased in 2011. Medium-term projections indicate that a
considerable degree of import compression is required to keep net foreign assets
approximately stable. Current account deficits underpinned by a limited and falling export
base combined with a weakening terms of trade, could bring about an external crisis,
culminating in an eventual disorderly exchange rate adjustment.

Pressures on the foreign exchange market have intensified. The spread between
the official and bureau rates widened to about 25 percent by end-July 2011, suggesting that
the official exchange rate is increasingly overvalued (Figure A2.2). In August 2011, the
Reserve Bank of Malawi (RBM) issued new foreign exchange regulations, requiring foreign
exchange bureaus to operate around the official rate within a band of +/- three percent (after a
devaluation of the official exchange rate by 10 percent). This requirement has generated
more foreign exchange activity in the parallel market and has led to a rise in the rate to
around 285 kwacha per dollar by early May, 2012. The premium needs to be measured
against this market, rather than the bureau market after July 2011. As long as there is a gap
between the official rate and the parallel market rate, there will be an arbitrage opportunity
for speculators to gain significant profits.

67
Figure A2.2. Malawi: Exchange Rate Premium
(Monthly 2009–11)

10.
Other indicators of foreign exchange availability suggest that excess demand
pressures in the market have intensified: (i) the interbank foreign exchange market
continues to be largely inactive, consistent with excess demand by banks’ own customers for
foreign exchange at the official exchange rate; (ii) the business community continues to
complain of a significant gap between the demand for and supply of foreign exchange and
some viewed the administration of the RBM prescreening of large foreign exchange
purchases (set at US$50,000) as an intensification of foreign exchange controls.
11.
Reserves are among the lowest in Sub-Saharan Africa (Figure A2.3). Low
reserves are symptomatic of persistent external imbalances, resulting from more rapid growth
of imports than exports, brought in part by rapid growth of nontradable agriculture relative to
tradable economic activities, but also high wage increases. The RBM has faced a constant
demand for foreign exchange during 2011, and as a result experienced a marked reduction in
the foreign exchange reserves. The RBM is not in a position to continue to meet the foreign
exchange demand through the sale of its reserves, especially with a weak tobacco market and
reduced donor support. Eventually, the RBM will run out of reserves or else it will need to
intensify rationing, and the exchange rate may depreciate in a disruptive manner.

12.
Up to April 2012, Malawi continued to experience foreign exchange shortages
and rationing, and private import payment arrears. There are arrears on fuel imports
(currently about US$50 million) and perhaps tobacco loans taken out by a governmentowned entity, Malawi Leaf. Banks have indicated that there is a substantial backlog of
foreign exchange requirements.
13.
The use of various macroeconomic indicators relating to the external sector and
foreign exchange market point to exchange rate misalignment in Malawi. Recent
developments concerning the terms of trade, real effective exchange rate, growths of imports
and exports, evolution of the current account, foreign exchange reserves and the foreign

69
exchange market premium suggest that an excess demand for foreign exchange persists and
that there is a need to address the underlying external disequilibrium.
III. THE EXTERNAL SUSTAINABILITY APPROACH
14.
The ES approach analyzes the relationship between the sustainability of a
country’s external stock position and its flow current account position. Unlike the MB
and ERER approaches, which require econometric estimation, the ES approach relies
substantially on very few assumptions relating to the real GDP growth and inflation. This
simple and transparent structure makes it a natural benchmark to compare with the two other
approaches. The ES approach shares one common feature with the MB approach in that it
assesses the exchange rate adjustment needed to bring the current account back to its norm.
However, the definition of the norm differs between the two approaches.
15.
The advantage of ES approach lies in its simple and intuitive estimation
methodology. The ES approach consists of three steps. Based on an intertemporal budget
constraint of the economy, the first step determines the ratio of the current account balance to
GDP that would stabilize the net foreign asset (NFA) position at a defined benchmark value.
The second step compares the NFA stabilizing current account to the underlying current
account balance. The third step computes the adjustment of the REER needed to close the
gap between the NFA stabilizing current account and the underlying current account. The
NFA stabilizing current account (CAs) is estimated using the following formula:
CAs 

g    (1  g )
 bs
(1  g )  (1   )

(1)

where g is the medium-term GDP growth rate and π is the medium-term inflation rate.
16.
Both the ES and MB approaches rely on the elasticity of the current account
with respect to changes in the real exchange rate as a key parameter. In general, this
parameter depends on the price elasticity of imports and exports (both demand and supply).
We follow Tokarick (2010) in deriving the formula for the elasticity under the assumption
that a country is sufficiently small for the export demand and import supply elasticities to be
equal to zero (that is Malawi is small enough not to have any effect on its import or export
prices). We also assume complete pass-through for both import and export prices. Table A2.1
lists the parameters relevant to the calculation and their associated values.

Following Tokarick (2010), the elasticity is calculated according to the formula:
(2)

Using the values from Table 1, one obtains the value of -0.25 for this elasticity. This
elasticity would be lower, if less than complete pass-through were assumed. Key assumptions
and results for the ES approach are shown in Table A2.2. We set the target for NFA that is
consistent with reserves covering 3 months of imports, using average projected imports for
2012 to 2017 and assuming no import compression.5 Table A2.2 summarizes other key
assumptions underlying the ES approach and the results. The external sustainability approach
suggests an overvaluation of the real exchange rate of 26.8 percent.

Both elasticities are obtained from Tokarick (2010) and are the minimum of the range of estimates provided in

An alternative approach entails modeling the NFA norm within a panel regression framework. Following the
literature on the ES approach and in view of data challenges and econometric estimation, we choose to calibrate
the NFA norm for Malawi instead.

71
IV. THE MACROECONOMIC BALANCE AND EQUILIBRIUM REAL EXCHANGE RATE
APPROACHES
18.
The MB approach determines the exchange rate adjustment that is required to
bring the underlying current account to a level consistent with the norm6 and the ERER
approach provides the gap between the equilibrium and actual exchange rates. The
starting point for these approaches is to identify the fundamentals that matter for the current
account and REER determination. For the former approach, the coefficients obtained from a
homogenous panel regression are applied to the identified fundamentals to derive the current
account norm, which is then compared to the underlying current account to measure the
required adjustment in the REER. The next section focuses on the theoretical foundations for
these approaches as well as the review of the literature on their empirical underpinnings.
B. Macroeconomic Determinants of the Current Account and the REER
19.
Theoretically, the same variables should simultaneously determine the real
exchange rate and the current account (Blanchard, 2007). However, the theoretical
underpinnings for the empirical analysis of the real exchange rate have usually emanated
from long-run steady-state analyses of models with tradable and nontradable goods in the
presence of balanced trade (Lee et al., 2008 and Prati et al., 2010). At the same time,
empirical analysis of the current account has been underpinned by the intertemporal approach
to the current account, emphasizing the main determinants of savings and investment. We
review below the expected relationship among each of the fundamentals, the current account
balance and the real exchange rate.
Fiscal policy
20.
Abstracting from Ricardian equivalence, fiscal policy tends to affect aggregate
demand and national saving, and consequently, the current account balance and the real
exchange rate. Fiscal policy affects the real exchange rate via the composition of government
expenditure, among other channels. An increased allocation of government spending to
nontraded goods would tend to increase the prices of these goods relative to tradables,
culminating in real exchange rate appreciation. In this connection, an improved fiscal
position, measured by a reduced deficit, should be associated with both real exchange rate
depreciation and an improved current account position.
Net foreign assets
21.
As Prati et al. (2010) and Lee et al. (2008) discuss, the effect of initial NFA on the
current account balance appears ambiguous. Countries with initially higher NFA can afford
6

In assessing the external position in Malawi, a model that is based on the current account is relevant, as it
constitutes one of the key indicators of the future behavior of an economy. Understanding the determinants of
current account imbalances is essential to designing an effective set of policies to address external imbalances to
achieve internal and external stability.

72
higher spending (because of the income flow)—and therefore a worse current account
balance—and remain solvent and this should be consistent with an appreciated real exchange
rate, as creditor countries will need a more appreciated exchange rate to incur trade deficits to
ensure intertemporal solvency. On the other hand, economies with initially high NFA benefit
from increased net foreign income flows, resulting in a positive relationship between NFA
and current account balances, somewhat delinked to exchange rate movements.
Demographics
22.
Reflecting the theory of the life-cycle, a higher share of dependent population reduces
national savings and the current account balance, thus resulting in a more appreciated
equilibrium real exchange rate. Population growth rate may capture the share of
economically dependent young people – a higher population growth rate should reduce
saving and consequently worsen the current account balance, hence this variable should have
a negative effect on the current account balance and lead to a more appreciated equilibrium
real exchange rate.
Stage of development and economic growth
23.
In line with the neoclassical theory, LICs should import capital and borrow against
their future incomes to finance their investment needs and smooth out consumption, given
the high marginal utility of consumption. Similarly, fast-growing economies with higher
expected productivity improvements should invest more, implying a deterioration of the
current account balance. Finally, high productivity growth in the tradable sector relative to
the non-tradable sector should be associated with a more appreciated real exchange rate
(Balassa-Samuelson effect). The real GDP per capita growth rate is included to control for
the relative level of economic development. As Lee et al. (2008) point out, among countries
at a similar initial stage of development, a country with a higher growth rate should have a
weaker current account balance.
Terms of trade
24.
The impact of a change in an economy’s terms of trade on its real exchange rate is
ambiguous, as it depends largely on the magnitude of income and substitution effects.
Depending on how the real exchange rate responds to the terms-of-trade change, the trade
balance and current account will adjust in a fashion that depends on the responsiveness of
trade flows to changes in the real exchange rate. Prati et al. (2010) show that the terms of
trade may have a significant effect on the current account balance of LICs.
Aid as a ratio of GDP and remittances as a ratio of GDP
25.
Aid in general can be used either to increase imports or build up foreign reserves
(see e.g. Berg et al., 2010). One would expect the first motive to dominate; hence the sign on
the aid to GDP ratio should be negative in a trade balance equation. The overall impact of aid
on the current account balance would depend on the relative share of concessionary loans and
grants in aid as well as the impact of these two variables on exchange rate movements.
Similarly, the impact of remittances on the current account is an empirical question, as

73
increases in remittances could have either positive or negative impact on the current account,
depending on whether the private consumption associated with remittances is lower or higher
than the initial increase in remittances. If remittances lead to increased access to external
funding, there could arise a situation whereby the increase in private consumption exceeds
remittances, leading to a lower current account position. The impact of aid inflows on the
real exchange rate depend on the composition of government expenditure, the efficiency with
which aid inflows is used and the complementarity between public infrastructure and private
investment. Going with the expectation of the fiscal motive being the rationale behind aid
inflows, one would expect at least some temporary real exchange rate appreciation to stem
from higher aid inflows and remittances.
B. Econometric Results: The Macroeconomic Balance Approach
26.
We made a series of adjustments to the standard framework for conducting an
analysis of real exchange rate misalignment:


One critical issue relates to the sample of countries to use in obtaining the parameters
required for estimating the current account norm. We were guided by the principle
of selecting a sample of countries that have shared economic characteristics to
avoid model misspecification. The panel for the estimation consists of 12 countries in
Sub-Saharan Africa.7



Since the time series available for many of countries in the panel is disrupted by data
inconsistencies and structural revisions to the data and the economy, along the lines
of Aydin (2010), we use annual data covering the period 2000–11.



In line with Vitek (2009), Aydin (2010) and Prati et al. (2011), the list of
fundamentals underlying the usual assessment of the determinants of the current
balance is extended to reflect the features of a developing economy like Malawi. In
this connection, the macroeconomic fundamentals include both aid inflows and
remittances in ascertaining the current account norm. Aid inflows (grants and
concessional loans) constituted about 28 percent of government expenditure and a
significant source of foreign exchange earnings in 2010. Remittances at about
US$50 million in 2010 (1 percent of GDP) are also quite significant.



Empirical studies have also shown that the terms of trade matter for current account
determination in developing economies. Thus we include the terms of trade as one of
the possible determinants of the current account and real exchange rate.

7

Specifically, these include: Botswana, Ethiopia, Kenya, Lesotho, Malawi, Mozambique, Namibia,
South Africa, Swaziland, Tanzania, Uganda, and Zambia.

74


One important element of our approach, which is consistent with the literature on real
exchange rate misalignment, is that most of the variables are expressed in relative
terms, compared to the trading partners.



The relatively small cross-sectional and time series dimensions of our sample
determine in part the choice of the econometric technique for the panel estimation.
The simple pooled least squares estimator suffers from short sample bias. Generalized
method of moments (GMM) techniques are commonly preferred and also correct for
potential endogeneities.



For Malawi, South Africa, the UK, and the US are the dominant trading partners. As
in Prati et al. (2010), the trade weights used are from the IMF – INS facility, with
some adjustments. Specifically, the weight for Swaziland in the last set of weights
(from 2005 onwards, equal to 0.06, previously equal to zero) is added to South
Africa, as Swaziland is more than likely an intermediary rather than the ultimate
destination for trade. Table 3 reports the top 5 trading partners for Malawi over
separate time periods. We do not impose a minimum cut-off point for weights to be
included in the trade-weighted average.

27.
The GMM approach points to the terms of trade, lagged NFA, and relative real
GDP per capita growth rate as the statistically significant determinants of the current
account (Table A2.4). Initially (full specification in Table A2.4), including all variables
makes it impossible to establish individual coefficients with any precision, owing to
relatively small sample size, however, coefficients are jointly significant. We proceed to
choose a model by removing the variables with the largest p-values, until only significant
variables (and a constant) remain. Following this strategy selects the variables in restricted
specification. Retaining the lagged values of dropped variables as instruments allows one to
conduct a test of over-identifying restrictions: the result is that they are not rejected at 5
percent significance.

This R-squared measure is the squared correlation coefficient of the predicted values from the
panel regression and the actual values.

28.
In order to calculate the current account norm, we summarize our results across
both full and restricted specifications:


Terms of trade is usually significant and has the expected sign in both specifications.
The income effects emanating from an improvement in the terms-of trade tend to
produce an improvement in the current account position.



Relative fiscal balance has the expected sign; however, it is not significant and is not
included in the restricted specification.



Aid and remittances as a ratio of GDP. The coefficient on aid is negative, as would
be expected if increased amounts of exogenous foreign aid allow financing higher
current account deficit. However, this coefficient is not statistically significant.
Remittances on the other hand, have a positive impact on the current account, but are
also not statistically significant.



Lagged NFA. The coefficient has a positive sign, as expected, if net foreign income
flows help and is statistically significant.



Population growth rate. It does not have the expected sign, and is also not statistically
significant.



The real GDP per capita growth rate, on the other hand, has the expected negative
sign and is significant in the restricted specification.

76
29.
The MB approach points to real exchange rate misalignment of 26.4 percent,
reflecting an underlying current account deficit of 7.9 percent (assuming no import
compression) and current account norm of -1.3 percent of GDP (Table A2.5).

The projections of the current account and its fundamentals are based on the
latest WEO data and the assumption of constant real exchange rate in the medium
term. In this connection, the underlying current account is projected on the premise of
assumption of no import compression so as to ascertain the exact magnitude of the exchange
rate misalignment, as this is consistent with the demand for foreign exchange both in the
public and private sectors. The medium term-projections that reflect the impacts of an
exchange rate adjustment would yield a different current account norm (This is planned to be
studied during the program negotiations with the authorities when there is a clearer picture of
their policy intentions).
C. Econometric Results: The Equilibrium Real Exchange Rate (ERER) Approach
31.
The reduced-form time series ERER approach to exchange rate assessment consists
of three steps. First, a measure of monthly commodity terms of trade (CTOT) is constructed
for Malawi between 1990M1 and 2012M2 and a cointegrating relationship between the
CTOT and the monthly REER is established. Second, equilibrium real exchange rates
predicted by the VAR model are computed as a function of the CTOT. Third, the percentage
deviations of the actual real exchange rates from their predicted values are calculated and
treated as a measure of the exchange rate misalignment.
32.
Fluctuations in the REER in Malawi have been associated with changes in the
commodity terms of trade (Figure A2.4). However, due to restrictive foreign exchange
policies, the REER has been much more stable than the commodity terms of trade, resulting
in a divergence between the CTOT and the REER. Our measure for the CTOT index is
defined as:

77

/

where
is a manufacturing unit value index used as a deflator, ( ) is the share of
exports (imports) of commodity j in country i’s total exports (imports), and is the
individual commodity price at time t. The commodities are: Tobacco, Uranium, Tea, Sugar,
Cotton, Rice, Coffee, Maize, Petroleum Products, and Fertilizers. By construction, the
movements in the CTOT index are due to changes in commodity prices as the export and
import shares are taken as fixed and so remain constant over time. For empirical application,
we calculate and as the average value of these shares between 1990 and 2011. The
CTOT index allows Malawi to be influenced by changes in commodity prices depending on
the composition of its export and import baskets. This is in contrast to the standard
commodity price indices most commonly used in the literature, such as the "All Primary
Commodities Index", which is not country specific.

The equilibrium real exchange rate (ERER) approach suggests that the kwacha
is significantly overvalued. A high frequency estimation of the cointegrating relationship
between the real exchange rate and the commodity terms of trade (as the only explanatory
variable) shows that they are cointegrated (with a statistically significant elasticity coefficient

78
of 41.8 percent). The estimation suggests that the kwacha is overvalued by around 34 percent
in February 2012 (see Figure A2.5).

V. CONCLUSIONS
34.
This note has assessed the degree of exchange rate misalignment in Malawi,
using four main approaches. All the methods point to real exchange rate overvaluation and
excess demand for foreign exchange. The model-based approaches indicate a real exchange
rate overvaluation in the range of 26 percent to 34 percent. We propose that the assessment
of real exchange rate misalignment in Malawi rely on indicators that capture developments in
the foreign exchange market, complemented by model-based approaches.
35.
Among the model-based approaches, we are of the view that the ES approach
and the high frequency ERER method appear to be the most plausible for examining
the critical issue of exchange rate misalignment in Malawi. It is extremely important to

79
reflect on the special circumstances of Malawi that is persistently off its demand curve for
foreign exchange (and therefore persistently out of equilibrium, making identification of the
equilibrium especially difficult). Unlike the MB approach, which requires a homogenouspanel-data estimation, the ES approach relies substantially on very few assumptions relating
to the real GDP growth and inflation. This simple and transparent structure makes its more
appealing for exchange rate assessment for Malawi.
36.
It is important to acknowledge that the results of the MB approach are sensitive
to the choice of the instruments, the strategy chosen to reduce the number of variables
in the specification, and revisions to the underlying data, which can, for the countries in
question, be substantial. This constitutes an additional reason to prefer simpler
specifications and, in particular, the developments in the parallel market, which presumably
provides a more accurate and policy-relevant guide to the extent of overvaluation of the
nominal exchange rate.
37.
A properly valued exchange rate is an important condition for improving the
competitiveness of an economy. In the context of Malawi, achieving an appropriate
exchange rate could help with: (i) reducing or eliminating underreporting of exports and
over-invoicing of imports; (ii) increasing inflows of remittances through the official
channels, which would help address deadweight loss associated with using informal
channels; (iii) reducing imports to ensure that the current account position is sustainable;
(iv) transitioning to increased exports; (v) accumulating international reserves, which will
help the country to withstand adverse exogenous shocks; and (vi) removing the adverse
impact of uncertainty relating to the exchange rate and foreign exchange regime on
investment and economic growth.

APPENDIX III. MALAWI: STRATEGIES FOR FINANCIAL DEEPENING1
1.
The Malawian authorities have been working on reforms to deepen the financial
sector and make it more inclusive. Regulatory and legal reforms have culminated in the
enactment of the following pieces of legislation: Banking Act; Microfinance Act; Securities
Act; Credit Reference Bureau Act; Microfinance Act; Securities Act; Financial Cooperatives
Act; Pension Act; and Payment System Act.
2.
Financial deepening indicators in Malawi are improving. Two indicators of financial
deepening (broad money as ratio of GDP and credit to the private sector as a ratio of GDP)
show an increasing trend.

Financial development indicators in Malawi are still low by regional standards.
As at end-2010, the ratio of broad money to GDP in Malawi was less than the median for
sub-Saharan Africa. Also, the ratio of credit to the private sector was lower than the median
for sub-Saharan countries.

A significant proportion of the Malawi’s population still continues to face severe
constraints in accessing financial services (FinScope, Malawi, 2008): (i) 26 percent of adults
are formally served (19% by banks and 7% by other formal financial institutions);
(ii) informal sources (borrowing from employers, obtaining credit from shops or receiving
input as credit) capture another 19% of the adult population; and (iii) the share of those
financially excluded from the financial sector is 55%. Low client income levels, low
financial literacy, risks arising from rain-fed agriculture and high cost of finance have been
identified as responsible for limited access to finance in Malawi (2008 FSAP and FinScope,
Malawi, 2008).

There is a huge potential for using Mobile -banking technology to increase access in
Malawi. Transformational branchless banking models in other countries, underpinned by the
use of technology and agents, have contributed to lowering the costs of intermediation and
reaching new areas and clients. Safaricom and M-payments service in Kenya [M-Pesa] is an
excellent example, which allows the transfer of money cheaply within Kenya via mobile
phone without a bank account. The introduction of M-PESA has facilitated a rapid increase in
financial intermediation.
6.
Another promising strategy is the use of agency agreement, which is a model favored
in several Latin American countries: Banks offer financial services through third-party agents
(stores or post offices). Agency agreements offset several supply-and demand-side
constraints simultaneously. Kenya has recently put in place the necessary regulatory
framework. In Brazil, the government routes most pension and social welfare payments
through banks which use correspondents, providing a backbone of transactions that underpin
the business model banking for branchless banking.

IV. MALAWI—EXTERNAL COMPETITIVENESS IN A REGIONAL CONTEXT1
I. INTRODUCTION
1.
Despite several successive years of strong growth, a number of indicators point
to a steady deterioration in Malawi’s external competitiveness relative to regional
peers. Malawi experienced an impressive average annual growth rate of 8.3 percent
during 2007–10, which was largely attributable to successful implementation of the Farm
Input Subsidy Program (FISP) and favorable weather conditions. However, growth was not
broad-based and was largely concentrated in the production of tobacco, which accounts for
over 60 percent of total exports, and a handful of other cash crops (including sugar and tea),
as well as maize, produced primarily for domestic consumption. With its export base still
relatively undiversified and largely dependent on rain-fed agriculture, the Malawian
economy remains highly vulnerable to a plethora of external shocks—including weather, aid,
and commodity price shocks. Moreover, rapid economic growth in the context of binding
capacity constraints and a limited domestic supply response, has fueled a sharp rise in import
demand and exacerbated a chronic shortage of foreign exchange.
2.
Attainment of the poverty reduction and developmental goals established in
Malawi’s Growth and Development Strategy (MGDS) requires an outward orientation
with supportive policies that enhance external competitiveness and diversified, inclusive
growth. In the MGDS, the Malawian authorities commit to the pursuit of sound economic
policies that help to sustain high growth, price stability, exchange rate flexibility and an
improved foreign reserve position. As a small, landlocked country with a limited domestic
market, sustaining high growth rates over the medium term will require a successful export
promotion strategy and strengthened cross-border ties. Moreover, with the current push
towards enhanced regional integration and the advent of the Grand Tripartite Free Trade
Area (comprised of the integration of the East African Community (EAC), COMESA, and
SADC), Malawi must at a minimum ensure that it implements policies that will enable it to
compete effectively with its regional peers.
3.
The note establishes a positive link between export performance and both export
diversification and external competitiveness, and analyzes trends in these indicators
from several dimensions. Malawi’s export performance is compared with that of a peer
group2 of regional countries—namely: countries that share a border with Malawi (Zambia,
Mozambique, and Tanzania) and countries belonging to the East African Community
(Burundi, Kenya, Rwanda, and Uganda); as well as other African Low-Income Countries
(LICs) and Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) as a whole. The note analyzes some stylized facts
(pertaining mainly to trade performance indicators); utilizes a number of indicators to

measure external competitiveness levels and any discernible trends over time; and tries to
explain export performance by assessing the magnitude and statistical significance of various
explanatory factors, including various measures of external competitiveness. It then
concludes by summarizing key findings and policy implications. It does so because
“Competitiveness is relevant for policymakers as it is based on variables that they can act
upon to create the conditions conducive to economic activities and prosperity”. (ECA, 2004)
II. STYLIZED FACTS

Malawi’s export growth has been stymied relative to that of other regional peers,
while imports have accounted for a larger and growing share of GDP— a clear
manifestation of Malawi’s chronic exchange rate misalignment (Figure A4.1). Malawi’s

export performance as a share of GDP weakened during 1990–2010 and relative to the
performance of other African LICs and SSA, while Malawi’s imports accounted for a
much larger share GDP than its regional counterparts. At the start of the period, Malawi’s
exports of goods and services as a percentage of GDP was significantly higher than that of
other African LICs, although performance was weaker than the SSA average. However,
by 2000–10, Malawi’s export performance deteriorated vis-à-vis the performance of other
African LICs, while still remaining well below the average for SSA. Malawi’s imports of
goods and services on the other hand were significantly higher than the average for other
African LICs, which for much of the period was in line with the average for SSA as a whole.

performance contrasts sharply with
that of Mozambique whose share rose from 5.5 percent of regional exports to 15 percent
during the same period. Moreover, the data also suggest that among this comparator group,
countries that increased their share of world exports also tended to be those that successfully
diversified, as a statistically significant negative relationship was found between the
Herfindahl Index of export concentration and the change in a country’s share of the region’s

external current account

from 1996–2010 without external
grants, and remained sizeable
even after receiving significantly
higher grants than the other
African LICs. By contrast, the
external current account for SSA
with grants registered a surplus
during 2005–10. Moreover, in the
absence of sizeable capital
inflows, Malawi’s persistent
current account deficit has
contributed to a steady loss of
international reserves, with import
cover remaining chronically low.
Malawi’s import cover was
consistently lower than other African LICs and the average for SSA, and was almost onethird of the African LIC average during 2006–10.

The World Bank’s Doing Business Indicators reveal that Malawi is at a
competitive disadvantage vis-à-vis business operating conditions and business
transaction costs in comparator countries (Figure A4.4). Malawi is in the tail end of the
distribution in the case of almost every indicator shown, and fairs much worse than either the
regional average for SSA or the sample-wide average. Moreover, Malawi’s overall ranking in
the Doing Business Index slipped from 141 in 2010 to 145 in 2011 out of 183 ranked
countries. Key supply-side bottlenecks have recently intensified, and mainly stem from a
chronic shortage of foreign exchange, resulting in shortages of fuel, power, water and
imported inputs—the latter also due to a drying up of external credit lines. Consequently,
activities in the manufacturing, transportation, and wholesale and retail trade sectors have
slowed significantly with several enterprises now operating well below capacity or shutting
down, resulting in widespread job losses. Anecdotal evidence also suggests that several
companies have put expansion plans on hold and that some foreign investors who considered
locating in Malawi have opted to go to neighboring countries instead.

III. MEASURING EXTERNAL COMPETITIVENESS

The Herfindahl Index, H (Appendix I), which sums the squares of the shares of
total exports, is used to assess the degree of concentration of a country’s exports at the
industry-specific level. COMTRADE Standard International Trade Classification, Rev.2
(SITC Rev.2.) data is used at the at the three-digit SITC level.

B. Trade Competitiveness Index
10.
Malawi’s overall external competitiveness is also assessed by updating the
Economic Commission for Africa’s (ECA) Trade Competitiveness Index (TCI)5. The
index assesses overall competitiveness based on a broad range of indicators, divided into
three dimensions:


Trade Enabling Environment Index (comprised of macroeconomic factors and
institutional quality)



Production Resource Index (measuring the availability of direct inputs to production,
such as quality of labor and water and land resources)



Infrastructure Index (measuring transport networks, energy infrastructure, and
communications networks).

Each index is computed separately for 27 selected African countries, and the three subindices collectively form the TCI (Appendix II contains a list of the indicators used in
computing the TCI).
11.
The TCI results, summarized below, show that Malawi’s competitiveness
ranking initially improved during 1980–99 and then declined sharply after 20006:

Results should only be seen as indicative, as they are sensitive to the choice of indicators.

92


Macroeconomic policies have had a profound influence on Malawi’s external
competitiveness. Improved macroeconomic stability at the start of the review period
contributed to rising external competitiveness, and weaker macroeconomic
performance to its decline since the mid-1990s. And, although Malawi’s trade
enabling environment score was higher at the end of the review period than at the
start of the period, the index has been trending down since 1995–99, in part due to
a deterioration in the macroeconomic stability sub-index after its peaking during
1990–94.



The Infrastructure Index declined rapidly. Infrastructure performance deteriorated
sharply, in per capita terms, because of a failure to keep pace with Malawi’s relatively
rapid population growth.

12.
There was a divergence between Malawi’s sample-wide overall external
competitiveness score and the average and median scores of the comparative group
during the same time period. Malawi’s overall trade competitiveness score and ranking

decreased significantly by the end of the period relative to the beginning of the period,
while the average and median rankings for the comparative group rose over the review
period—suggesting that sound policies are needed to keep pace with strong regional
performers. Moreover, there was some movement of the relative rankings within the
comparator group during the review period—for instance, the rankings for Mozambique and
Zambia improved while those for Burundi and Malawi worsened.

more diversified export base. This is also consistent
with the fact that the three lowest ranking countries in
the subgroup in terms of overall trade competitiveness
(namely, Malawi, Burundi and Kenya) all experienced a decrease in their regional world
export shares (see ¶5).
C. Regression Analysis
14.
Regression analysis was used to help to determine the relative importance of key
determinants of export performance. The following simple market equilibrium model of
export performance provides us with a mechanism for gauging the influence of key
determining factors:

Export Demand :
Q d    * P   2 * Y  d
Q s    * P   2 * X  s
Export Supply :
Equilibriu m condition : Q d  Q s  Q
Where :
Q d  Export volume demand
Q s  Export volume supply
P  Export price index
X  Vector of determinan ts
Y  World real GDP growth
ε  Error terms for export demand and supply, respective ly

The model is estimated simultaneously, and the specification adopted is log-linear, so that the
coefficients represent elasticities. Estimation was based on a pooled sample of 27 countries,
including Malawi, for the period 1981–2008.
15.
Since the sample is largely comprised of commodity producers that are assumed
to be largely price takers, we focus on the export supply equation (Table A4.7):


After adjusting for the presence of serial correlation, Equation (2) shows that the
diversification index, gross fixed capital formation (GFCF), trade enabling index are
all significant determinants of export supply, with elasticities of: 0.75 percent,
0.17 percent, and 0.13 percent, respectively. However, the real effective exchange
rate and export supply variables, which are statistically significant in the first
equation (before the correction for serial correlation) lose their significance after the
first order autoregression correction is applied.

IV. COMPETITIVENESS AND CAPITAL FLOWS
16.
External competitiveness is equally important for attracting and retaining
portfolio capital inflows, which can be an important source of foreign financing. Prior
to the onset of the global financial crisis in 2008, foreign holdings of Government of Malawi
T-bills accounted for about eight percent of the total outstanding stock of T-bills. However,
following a resumption of global investment flows to emerging markets and LDCs, foreign
participation in the local T-bill market is non-existent and deterred by macroeconomic
instability and investor concerns about sovereign and repatriation risk.
17.
Foreign investor concerns are also shared by domestic investors. For instance, the
Malawi Stock Exchange (MSE) experienced a record increase in total trading volumes in
2011 (a total of 1,590,006,001 shares valued at over US$1.86 billion were traded, compared
to 241,957,941 valued at US$53.3 million in 2010). However, this growth may not be
sustained if the investment climate is not made more conducive.
18.
Comparative applicable tax rates from regional stock exchanges show that
Malawi’s tax rates are now among the highest in SADC. In particular, Malawi now has

the highest Capital Gains Tax (following the recent application of capital gains taxes of
30 percent to MSE transactions) and VAT rate on share commissions, and is among the stock
exchanges with the highest corporate tax rates in the region. Malawi’s Confederation of
Chamber of Commerce and Industry (MCCCI) and Society of Accountants in Malawi have
petitioned the Government to revisit its taxation policy in a number of areas that are seem as
particularly inimical to investment—including concerns expressed about the level of the
Withholding Tax (which is believed to hurt small and medium enterprises (SMEs)
disproportionately), the introduction of the turnover tax for transaction volumes under
K50 million irrespective of profitability, and the 30 percent capital gains tax. In addition, the
VAT payment schedule at mid-month often compels businesses to have to borrow to pay
their VAT obligations before they receive payment for the services rendered. The private
sector has argued that these and other policies make it difficult for Malawi to compete
effectively with other attractive investment destinations with the region and elsewhere.

96
V. KEY FINDINGS AND POLICY IMPLICATIONS
19.
The foregoing gives rise to the following observations and policy
recommendations:


External competitiveness is vital for achieving MGDS goals and becomes even more
acutely important with the move towards enhanced regional integration.



However, there are worrisome signs that Malawi has lost regional competitiveness
along several dimensions during 1980–2008, and this inference is drawn from a wide
range of indicators and methodologies.



There are several drivers of export performance within SSA—and export supply
considerations are of first and foremost importance, since most SSA commodity
producers are price takers.



Key determinants of overall export performance include: GFCF, the degree of export
diversification, and changes in the trade enabling environment index of competitiveness
(which includes indicators that assess overall macroeconomic stability). Policies aimed
at boosting these indicators should therefore be actively pursued.



The trade-enabling component of the TCI (with both a macro stability and an
institutional component) appears to be the most important driver of export
performance. So enhancing competitiveness in these areas through the following
measures will be critical:
a.

Prudent demand management. The pursuit of appropriate fiscal, monetary
and exchange rate policies in order to maintain price stability and mitigate
pressure on the international reserves and allow for a flexible response to
exogenous shocks, including through the adoption of an appropriate exchange
rate policy.

b.

Foreign exchange market liberalization. Liberalization of restrictions on
current account transactions, as a confidence building measure to attract
additional foreign inflows and increase the availability of foreign exchange at
market-determined rates.

c.

Structural reforms to strengthen the business climate and stimulate
domestic and foreign investment and growth. Measures to strengthen
institutions, enhance labor productivity, deepen access to finance, and reduce
business transaction costs should help to enhance the attractiveness of doing
business in Malawi.

 Xi = the ith export sector at the three-digit SITC
 Si = the ith sector’s share of total exports, and N is the maximum number of sectors
appearing in the sample during the review period.
 The higher is H, the greater the concentration of exports in a few products. The lower
limit of H is 100/N, representing a totally even distribution of exports, and the upper
limit of H is 100, representing a totally uneven distribution. Therefore, the ratio
between the H index and 100/N conveys an idea of the extent of the deviation from an
even distribution, and thus of the degree of export concentration.

APPENDIX V. MALAWI—JOINT IMF/WORLD BANK DEBT SUSTAINABILITY ANALYSIS8
Based on the Joint Fund-Bank Debt Sustainability Framework for Low-income Countries
(LIC DSA), Malawi’s risk of external debt distress remains moderate. Malawi’s narrow
export base, reliance on rain-fed agriculture, and weak international reserves leave it
vulnerable to terms-of-trade, and weather shocks. Stress testing reveals potential
vulnerabilities in Malawi’s public debt situation. In particular, the external sector debt
burden indicator (PV of debt-to-exports) breaches the sustainability threshold after an export
shock. Malawi’s debt situation is expected to improve over the medium- to long- run,
reflecting strong economic growth under a floating exchange rate regime and a liberalized
current account. However, measures to support a diversification of the export base will also
be important. Fiscal dominance has contributed to the increase in domestic debt burden
indicators, whereby the PV of public debt to GDP ratio reaches about 45.5 percent in 2012
and gradually comes down to about 13.9 percent by 2032. Stress tests to public sector debt
dynamics reveal the need for significant fiscal consolidation and reform of parastatal
institutions.
I. BACKGROUND
20.
Malawi’s medium- and long-term public and publicly guaranteed (PPG)
external debt is estimated at US$1.14 billion, reflecting a significant increase in recent
years. Malawi’s external debt was lowered to a sustainable level of about 15 percent of GDP
in 2006, after it received debt relief under the Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC)
initiative and the Multilateral Debt Relief Initiative (MDRI). The level of the external debt
stock has increased substantially since then, to 23 percent of GDP (about US$1.14 billion) at
end-2011. The share of multilateral debt decreased (to about 73 percent from 90 percent as at
end-2008). Malawi’s main bilateral creditors are China and India, while the main multilateral
creditor is IDA. In addition, increased government expenditure at a time when external grants
fell sharply and revenue performance deteriorated, contributed to the build-up of the
domestic debt in 2011 (to about 25 percent of GDP from 20 percent of GDP as at end-2008).
The level of total public debt in Malawi is estimated at US$2.4 billion. Reliable figures on
private external debt are not available, although the amounts are not believed to be large.

The DSA was prepared by IMF and World Bank staff in collaboration with the Malawian authorities. The
analysis updates the previous Joint DSA dated February 10, 2010 (IMF Country Report No. 10/24). The DSA
follows the IMF and World Bank Staff Guidance Note on the Application of the Joint Fund-Bank Debt
Sustainability Framework for Low-Income Countries (January 22, 2010).

II. UNDERLYING DSA ASSUMPTIONS
21.
The baseline scenario reflects the recent policy measures taken by the authorities
to restore macroeconomic stability in Malawi. In May 2012, the authorities implemented a
set of measures to address Malawi’s chronic balance of payments difficulties and to halt a
slowdown in economic activity due to shortages of foreign exchange and critical imports.
The policies included a devaluation of the exchange rate from K167 to K250 per U.S. dollar
in May 2012, and adoption of a floating exchange rate regime. Further policy measures are
envisaged under a new Extended Credit Facility (ECF) arrangement, including prudent fiscal
and monetary policies, structural reforms and policies to enhance the investment climate,
promote export diversification and foster growth. The baseline assumes a gradual reduction
in the external current account deficit through export diversification, and reliance on grants
and concessional financing in the medium term. The current mining projects are expected to
continue as planned combined with additional projects in uranium and other minerals such as
niobium. It also assumes that contingent risks stemming from parastatal organizations are
contained. The key macroeconomic assumptions are summarized in Box 1.
22.
The evolution of key debt indicators followed a somewhat different trajectory
than the projections in the previous DSA (February 2010). For example, the ratio of total
public debt to GDP was 48 percent at end-2011, compared with a projected level of

103
34 percent, reflecting higher-than-projected levels of domestic borrowing. By contrast, the
PV of external debt-to-export ratio, estimated at 61 percent for end-2011, was slightly lower
than projected (65 percent), on account of better-than-expected export performance. The
annual average real GDP growth for 2009–11 was in line with the projected 6.6 percent, but
there was a marked downward trend compared to a steady path in the projections. Going
forward, the current DSA projects long-term growth of 6 percent per year, compared to
6.7 percent in the previous DSA. The current projection is consistent with the historical
average growth rate of 5.8 percent over the last ten years.
23.
Malawi’s economic performance is expected to improve over the medium term.
Real GDP growth is projected to rise gradually from 4.3 percent in 2012 to about 6½ percent
over the medium term. The floating of the kwacha and liberalization of the foreign exchange
regime is expected to foster growth over the medium term by redirecting resources to exports
and import-competing production, while containing import demand for consumption goods.
In the near term, growth will be generated by the sectors that were hardest hit by the foreign
exchange shortages, including manufacturing, transportation service, construction, and trade,
as production levels increase toward capacity. Other sectors, including agriculture, will also
benefit from the easing of fuel shortages. Over time, growth is expected to be led by mining
and non-traditional agricultural exports. Following the recent devaluation of Kwacha, a spike
in inflation is expected in the next few months (reaching about 20 percent by end-2012), but
this should be reversed with implementation of restrained fiscal and monetary policies over
the medium term.
24.
The main downside risks to the debt sustainability outlook are
deterioration in the terms of trade and adverse weather conditions that lower
agricultural output. Malawi’s narrow export base, reliance on rain-fed agriculture,
and weak international reserves leave it vulnerable to terms-of-trade and weather
shocks. Stress tests (see next section) show that the main external sector debt burden
indicator (PV of debt-to-exports ratio) breaches the sustainability threshold after an export
shock—a proxy for both the terms-of-trade and weather shocks. Malawi’s debt situation is
expected to improve over the medium-to-long run. The recent liberalization of the foreign
exchange regime for current account transactions is expected to encourage private investment
and promote diversified growth. Repairing strained relations with donors and more consistent
implementation of prudent fiscal and monetary policies are expected to increase foreign
exchange inflows into the country and facilitate the accumulation of international reserves.

9

Malawi’s stock of external debt declined substantially from about 112 percent of GDP in 2005 to
around 14.6 percent in 2006. The previous DSA estimated the stock of Malawi’s debt at US$683 million as of
end-2008.

104
Box 1: Baseline Macroeconomic Assumptions
Real GDP is projected to grow by about 6 percent per
year on average over the long term, owing to timely
adoption of a comprehensive policy package by the
authorities. The main drivers of growth will be
agriculture, manufacturing, trade, and mining sectors. The
adopted policy package is underpinned by foreign
exchange market reforms and structural measures to
enhance the productive capacity of the economy.
The mining sector is projected to increase its
contribution to GDP. New mining operations will include
the production of rare earth metals (e.g., ferroniobium,
tantalum fluorite, and zircon).
Consumer price inflation is projected to increase to an
annual average rate of 18.4 percent in 2012 after the
devaluation in May 2012. However, inflation is projected
to decelerate in the medium term after a short-lived spike,
reaching single-digit levels. The nominal effective
exchange rate is assumed to be determined by inflation
differential between Malawi and its trading partners after
2014.
Revenue (excluding grants) is projected to increase
relative to GDP in FY2012/13 owing to the positive
impact of a unified exchange rate regime on tax revenues
from international trade by increasing the share of formal
transactions being taxed and the adoption of an automatic
fuel price adjustment mechanism. In subsequent years,
both tax and non-tax revenues improve gradually owing
to improved tax efforts and expanded tax base. More
fiscal discipline, entailing expenditure prioritization to
protect critical social and infrastructure programs will be
required. Domestic financing of the budget is projected to
stay at zero percent of GDP in the medium term but will
increase to an average 0.5 percent of GDP after
FY2017/18.

Grants are projected to increase to about 10.4 percent of
GDP during FY 2012/13 as development partners are
increasing their support for Malawi after the exchange
rate unification. This reflects the restoration of budget
support grants and increase in project grants. Afterwards,
total grants are projected to stabilize in U.S. dollar terms
but decrease gradually as a ratio of GDP. With increased
support from donors, total external financing of
government operations will also increase.
Current account deficit, including official transfers, is
projected to narrow over the medium term. The exchange
rate liberalization is expected to slow growth in imports
(especially of consumer goods) and boost exports. Policy
reforms are also expected to attract private capital inflows
into Malawi and a gradual build up of international
reserves.
Exports performance is projected to strengthen in the
medium term as the change in exchange rate regime is
expected to mobilize resources toward export-oriented
activities. Export growth is projected to average about
9 percent during 2012–32. Tobacco’s share in overall
export is expected to decline as global demand weakens
and the farmers diversify to other commodities. However,
tobacco is assumed to be substituted by other nontraditional agricultural products over the medium term.
Imports grew at an average annual rate of 10 percent
during 2002–11. The floating of the kwacha and
liberalization of the foreign exchange regime is expected
to contain imports demand over the medium term due to
cost considerations and lower purchasing power of
kwacha. Imports are projected to grow at an
annual average rate of about 8 percent during the period
2012–32.

Highly concessional financing from multilaterals is
assumed to be the major source of debt (two-thirds), with
somewhat less concessional financing from non-Paris
Club creditors providing the balance. A small but
increasing amount of borrowing on commercial terms is
assumed for the outer years.

III. EXTERNAL DEBT SUSTAINABILITY
Baseline scenario
25.
Under the baseline scenario and over the projection period, external debt burden
indicators fall and remain below the indicative policy thresholds (Figure 1 and Table 1)10.
10

The World Bank’s Country Policy and Institutions Assessment (CPIA) ranks Malawi as a medium performer (the average
CPIA in 2008–10 is 3.37). Thus, the external debt burden thresholds for Malawi are (i) a PV of debt-to-GDP at: 40 percent;
(ii) a PV of debt-to-exports at: 150 percent; (iii) a PV of debt-to-revenue at: 250 percent; (iv) a debt service-to-exports at:
20 percent: and (v) a debt service-to-revenue at: 30 percent.

105
The stock of external public and publicly guaranteed (PPG) debt is expected to gradually
decline in the long term from about 30 percent of GDP in 2012 to about 14 percent in 2032.
The present value (PV) of PPG external debt-to-GDP gradually declines to below 8.7 percent
during the rest of the projection period. The PV of debt-to-exports ratio remains well below
the threshold of 150 percent throughout the entire period. The PV of PPG external debt to
revenue is also on a downward trend from a peak of 105 percent in 2012 and will remain well
below the threshold of 250 percent during the entire period.
Stress tests
26.
The PV of debt-to-exports ratio (which is one of the external debt sustainability
thresholds) is breached under stress tests (exports shock in particular). The standard
sensitivity analysis points to medium risk of debt distress (Figure 1 and Table 3), as one debt
burden indicator (PV of debt-to-exports ratio) breaches its respective threshold after the
shock in 2014 reaching the value of 185 (in percent of GDP) and only coming down to
138 percent of GDP in 2021. Based on the bound tests, the most extreme stress for the
PV of debt-to-exports ratio is a one-standard deviation shock to the export value growth in
2013–14. Tobacco still accounts for more than half of Malawi’s export earnings, and though
this proportion is expected to decline over time, Malawi will remain vulnerable to a shock to
tobacco export values for some time. Burley accounts for the majority of production, leaving
Malawi vulnerable to changes in tastes and regulatory actions that could dramatically shrink
what is already a stagnant global market.
27.
Debt service ratios are expected to remain below the threshold for the projection
period. All debt service ratios remain below their respective thresholds (Figure 1 and
Table 1) both in the baseline and under the shock scenarios.
IV. PUBLIC DEBT SUSTAINABILITY
Baseline scenario
28.
Malawi’s public debt has risen substantially since the run-up to the May 2009
presidential and parliamentary elections. The share of domestic debt in the total public
debt of Malawi is high (about 52 percent of total public debt) owing to increased domestic
debt issuance by the government and the financing of the fiscal deficit by the central bank
(Figure 2 and Table 2). The PV of public debt to GDP ratio is expected to reach about
45.5 percent in 2012 and only come down to the levels below 32 percent in the medium term
and about 14 percent by 2032.
Stress tests
29.
Stress tests indicate that key ratios could deviate significantly from the
baseline levels in the face of less favorable macroeconomic conditions (Figure 2 and
Table 4). Maintaining the primary balance at the 2012 level leads to a slight decline in

106
the PV debt-to-GDP ratio from 45 percent in 2012 to 41 percent at the end of the projection
period (2032), compared to a decline to 14 percent under the baseline. A permanently
lower GDP growth rate than the baseline produces a less pronounced decline in the PV debtto-GDP ratio to 34 percent, compared to 14 percent under the baseline.
30.
Malawi is subject to a number of fiscal risks stemming from the activities of lossmaking parastatal institutions. The government’s efforts to achieve fiscal sustainability
and reduce the risks to the budget posed by contingent liabilities and operational losses of
state owned enterprises are critical. In this connection, measures to enhance revenue
performance, restrain growth in expenditures, limiting the National Oil Company to its core
mandate of managing strategic reserves of fuel and a robust regulatory regime for public
utilities that focuses on cost recovery, are very important.
IV. CONCLUSIONS
31.
Malawi is assessed to be at medium risk of debt distress. The external debt
indicator (PV of debt-to-exports) breaches its threshold in the scenario of bound tests. Stress
tests to public sector debt dynamics underpin the need for effective fiscal consolidation,
while protecting critical social and infrastructure expenditures.
32.
The adoption of corrective policy measures in 2012 has significantly improved
the outlook for Malawi’s debt sustainability, but risks related to terms of trade and
weather shocks remain. In particular, Malawi’s heavy reliance on rain-fed agriculture and
narrow export base make its export earnings vulnerable to fluctuations in world prices of its
key exports. However, the liberalization of the foreign exchange regime will help to remove
distortions and thereby encourage private investment and diversified growth, and help
enhance the country’s debt carrying capacity. Implementation of sound macroeconomic
policies, diversification of the export base, and sustained growth would help reduce the risk
of debt distress.

1/ Includes both public and private sector external debt.
2/ Derived as [r - g - ρ(1+g)]/(1+g+ρ+gρ) times previous period debt ratio, with r = nominal interest rate; g = real GDP growth rate, and ρ = growth rate of GDP deflator in U.S. dollar terms.
3/ Includes exceptional financing (i.e., changes in arrears and debt relief); changes in gross foreign assets; and valuation adjustments. For projections also includes contribution from price and exchange rate changes.
4/ Assumes that PV of private sector debt is equivalent to its face value.
5/ Current-year interest payments divided by previous period debt stock.
6/ Historical averages and standard deviations are generally derived over the past 10 years, subject to data availability.
7/ Defined as grants, concessional loans, and debt relief.
8/ Grant-equivalent financing includes grants provided directly to the government and through new borrowing (difference between the face value and the PV of new debt).

1/ Variables include real GDP growth, growth of GDP deflator (in U.S. dollar terms), non-interest current account in percent of GDP, and non-debt creating flows.
2/ Assumes that the interest rate on new borrowing is by 2 percentage points higher than in the baseline., while grace and maturity periods are the same as in the baseline.
3/ Exports values are assumed to remain permanently at the lower level, but the current account as a share of GDP is assumed to return to its baseline level after the shock (implicitly assuming
an offsetting adjustment in import levels).
4/ Includes official and private transfers and FDI.
5/ Depreciation is defined as percentage decline in dollar/local currency rate, such that it never exceeds 100 percent.
6/ Applies to all stress scenarios except for A2 (less favorable financing) in which the terms on all new financing are as specified in footnote 2.

Assistance committed under the original framework is expressed in net present value (NPV) terms at the completion point, and
assistance committed under the enhanced framework is expressed in NPV terms at the decision point. Hence these two amounts
cannot be added.

The MDRI provides 100 percent debt relief to eligible member countries that qualified for the assistance. Grant assistance from
the MDRI Trust and HIPC resources provide debt relief to cover the full stock of debt owed to the Fund as of end-2004 that
remains outstanding at the time the member qualifies for such debt relief.

Implementation of Post-Catastrophe Debt Relief (PCDR): Not Applicable
Safeguards Assessments:
An update safeguards assessment of the Reserve Bank of Malawi (RBM) with respect to the
2012 ECF has been initiated and will be completed by the first review. The latest safeguards
assessment was completed on June 25, 2010 and concluded that the RBM continued to have
strong financial safeguards in the areas of external audit and financial reporting. The main area

116
of concern was the lack of adequate autonomy for the RBM, which is now being addressed by
the program. Another key recommendation related to the strengthening of the foreign reserves
management oversight.
Exchange Arrangements:
During the second review of the PRGF arrangement in August 2006, a multiple currency
practice (MCP) under Article VIII emerged (manifested by the significant spread between the
commercial bank exchange rates and the rates at foreign exchange bureaus). Staff is in the
process reviewing recent reforms to make an assessment of Malawi’s exchange system. From
mid 2006 to late 2009, the authorities kept the exchange rate stable, at 141 Malawi kwacha to
the U.S. dollar. From November 2009 to mid January 2010, the authorities gradually devalued
the currency about 8 percent relative to the U.S. dollar to 151 kwacha to the U.S. dollar. On
August 2011, the authorities devalued kwacha by another 10 percent bringing the Malawi
kwacha to the U.S. dollar rate to 166. In May 2012, the government liberalized the foreign
exchange regime and devalued the kwacha by about 33 percent. Malawi maintains restrictions
on the capital account. Currently, Malawi’s exchange rate regime is reclassified as “floating”.
Article IV Consultation:
Malawi is on a 24-month Article IV consultation cycle. The current Article IV Consultation is
delayed owing to extended discussions on the second review of the ECF-supported program
followed by the authorities’ request in April 2012 for a new ECF arrangement. The Executive
Board concluded the last Article IV consultation with Malawi on February 10, 2010.
Financial Sector Assessment Program (FSAP), Reports on Observance of Standards and
Codes (ROSCs), and Offshore Financial Center (OFC) Assessments:
A joint team of the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund visited Malawi under the
FSAP program during two missions in July and December 2007. The Financial System Stability
Assessment (FSSA) was issued in June 2008.
Corporate Governance and Accounting and Auditing ROSC missions visited Malawi during
missions in February and June 2007.
An update on the FAD mission on the fiscal transparency module was issued in March 2007. A
ROSC on the data module, based on a September 2003 mission, was published in
October, 2004.

ANNEX III. MALAWI—STATISTICAL ISSUES
Introduction
1.
Although economic data provision has some shortcomings, it is broadly adequate for
surveillance.
2.
The data module of the Report on the Observance of Standards and Codes (data
ROSC), published February 17, 2005, found that, while the institutional framework for the
production of macroeconomic statistics was broadly adequate, there were shortcomings in the
scope, accuracy, and reliability of data. The weakest areas are: national accounts, balance of
payments statistics, government finances statistics, and monetary and financial statistics. A
key STA recommendation was to formally assign the responsibility for the compilation of
government finance statistics to the Ministry of Finance and responsibility for the
compilation of monetary statistics to the RBM.
3.
The authorities are making efforts to improve the quality and timeliness of economic
and financial data through participation in the Fund’s General Data Dissemination System
(GDDS) and the GDDS Project for Anglophone African Countries. Malawi is participating in
the GDDS/PRSP and the monetary and financial statistics modules of the project. GDDS
metadata have been posted on the Fund’s Dissemination Standards Bulletin Board (DSBB)
since February 2007.
National accounts
4.
The accuracy and reliability of the real sector data (including national accounts,
prices, and trade) are affected by inadequate source data and timeliness. STA has
recommended remedial actions, including the need for additional resources for the National
Statistics Office (NSO). A long-term technical assistance program in the area of national
accounts is being provided under a project by Norwegian counterparts. The NSO have
revised the national accounts methodology to implement the SNA93 and to better account for
the activities in the informal sector. New estimates for Real and Nominal GDP based on the
base year 2007 are submitted.
Consumer prices
5.
A consumer price index (CPI) is available on a timely basis. The CPI base is 2000,
drawing on the 1997/98 household survey, and data (on urban and rural price indices) are
collected on a monthly basis by regional price collectors. There are plans to revise the CPI
weights based on the 2010 planned Integrated Household Survey (IHS).
Government finance statistics
6.
The accuracy and reliability of the data are affected by inadequate source data. A key
shortcoming in this area is inadequate system of recording source data. In addition, there are

123
serious quality problems, including data inconsistencies, that complicate program
monitoring:


While tax revenue data are received in a timely fashion, it is not always possible to
reconcile them with deposits in the Malawi Government (MG) Account.



Nontax revenue, including capital revenues collected by line ministries are not
properly accounted for in the fiscal reports prepared by the Ministry of Finance.



Data on recurrent expenditure suffer from serious shortcomings partly related to
insufficient bank reconciliation between expenses records prepared by line ministries
and financing information prepared by the Ministry of Finance. Line ministries
submit spending reports to the Ministry of Finance based on recorded expenses, while
the Ministry of Finances estimates expenses based on funding data (from the Credit
Ceiling Authority). At times, there are sizable discrepancies between these two
sources of data for both wages and other recurrent transactions—to some extent
reflecting the widespread practice of reallocation across budget lines.



Domestically financed development expenditure estimates are based on funding
released to line ministries, and estimates on externally funded expenditure are based
on reported project grants and loans. Owing to differences in timing and financing
modalities (e.g., some donors require prefinancing of expenditure before
reimbursement), there are substantial differences between the flow of expenses and
corresponding financing data. In addition, many donor projects are still not
incorporated in the budget, and hence the corresponding expenditure is not captured
in government finance statistics. Some externally funded development expenditures
are likely recurrent and reported capital expenditure therefore overstated.



Data on expenditure arrears are likely incomplete, as reporting from the Commitment
Control System appears to be only partial, and ministry level data are not consistent
from report to report.



Malawi’s current budget classification includes economic and program classification
and program, but does not include an effective administrative/organizational
classification.11 Expenditure data is loosely mapped to functional classification based
on the CoFoG classification.



The budget classification and chart of accounts may be adequate for some
administrative, economic, functional and program classifications. An output-oriented
activities-based budget classification (ABB) is used for the presentation of the budget.
However, pro-poor expenditures that have been protected in line with the PRSP are
only identified in the ABB classification. As no bridge table exists to map the ABB
classification into the program classification used for expenditure reporting and

11

Economic classifications were upgraded to GFS 2001 compatible framework in FY 2006/07.

124
accounting, pro-poor expenditures cannot be monitored. Under the ECF program, the
government is expected to develop a mechanism for properly monitoring social
expenditures.


The government nomenclature program/subprogram currently used for the functional
classification seems appropriate considering the nature of the items classified under
this group. The items currently classified under this group include functions,
programs and administrative levels. Although substantial elements of the current
output based budget structure appear to be predominately functional in nature, it is
not clear whether they are cleanly linked to classification of functions of government
(CoFoG). As such, the government should review the current budget structure and the
functional classification based on CoFoG (GFSM2001) to verify that they are aligned.



The absence of a financial administrative structure, complete with vertical
hierarchy of responsibilities inhibits the use of Government Finance
Statistics (GFS). Budget funds are directed to organizations generally defined as cost
centers (e.g., headquarters of ministries down to the level of secondary school
principals). As such, there does not appear to be an effective hierarchal financial
system. However, to be clear, over the past two years, sub-votes have been introduced
to a number of Ministries, but not as yet, a system of warrants and sub-warrants have
not been introduced.



Financing estimates are based on monetary and debt data, rather than on government
records of financing. Reporting on treasury bills directly issued to the RBM at times
has been slow.

7.
The authorities have received significant technical assistance from the Fund and other
donors to strengthen expenditure monitoring and reporting, accounting, and statistical
reporting, but results have lagged. The government has pledged to strengthen public financial
management and fiscal reporting, and renewed efforts are being made to establish a work
plan, including utilizing donor technical assistance more effectively. The authorities are
currently working with AFRITAC to modify its chart of accounts and output-based structures
so that they could more easily be realigned to the national strategy and can be readily
understood.
8.
Government finance data are not reported for publication in the Government Finance
Statistics Yearbook (GFSY) or the International Financial Statistics (IFS). An August 2005
and August 2007 STA mission that visited Lilongwe reiterated the importance of continued
efforts to implement the Integrated Financial Management Information System (IFMIS), and
encouraged the authorities to improve the coverage and sectorization of government financial
operations and to correctly classify transactions according to international guidelines. The
mission proposed, and discussed with the authorities, a migration plan and timetable to adopt
the GFSM 2001 methodology.

125
9.
A GFS TA mission visited Lilongwe in June 2011 in the context of the country’s
participation in the GFS Module under the Enhanced Data Dissemination Initiative funded by
DFID. It found that annual and sub-annual data for budgetary central government are
compiled in GFSM 1986 format of the Ministry of Finance, but are not disseminated. A new
chart of accounts aligned with the GFSM 2001 was introduced in the 2011–12 budget cycle,
which applies to all general government units. A number of source data issues were
identified and recommendations made to address them. Bridge tables linking the national
classifications and GFSM 2001 classifications were prepared by the mission, and should be
revised and used to compile GFS in GFSM 2001 format. A follow up mission is included in
the RAP for FY 2013.
Monetary and financial statistics
10.
Despite recent improvements, monetary and financial statistics (MFS) continue to
have shortcomings. These includes irregular reporting to STA, lack of proper legislation to
grant the authority to the RBM to require reporting from other institutions12; the sectorization
of the domestic economy, and classification of financial instruments to ensure that the RBM
adheres fully to the methodology of the Monetary and Financial Statistics Manual. The
2004, 2008, 2009, and 2010 missions noted and made a number of recommendations for
addressing the above shortcomings. In addition to the above tasks, the 2008, 2009, and
2010 STA missions assisted RBM staff in developing the standardized report forms (SRFs)
for the central bank accounts (1SR), other depository corporations (2SR), and monetary
aggregates (5SR).
External sector statistics
11.
The external sector statistics in Malawi exhibit serious deficiencies. Concepts and
definitions used to compile the balance of payments statistics are in broad conformity with
the guidelines presented in the fourth edition of the Balance of Payments Manual (BPM4),
although there has been some progress in the transition to the methodology of BPM5. The
National Statistical Office of Malawi (NSO) should now adopt the BPM6 methodology, on
the basis of which the Malawi balance of payments metadata should also be updated. Balance
of payments data remain weak in a number of key areas. The NSO balance of payments
section remains crucially understaffed, as it has been since March 2008. Moreover, important
data sources for balance of payments compilation ceased to be available during 2006–07, for
example exchange control forms, which could supply information on imports of goods,
services, and current transfers. Procedures for assessing the accuracy of trade data need to be
improved.

12

Some legislation that is designed to address this issue has recently been approved. However, some of the
pending legislation would give and strengthen the authority of the RBM in this regard.

126
12.
The NSO had compiled new balance of payments data and validated the results from
two key surveys: the BOP Survey and the survey on nonprofit institutions serving households
(NPISH), both based on the BPM5 methodology. The NSO also compiled information from
other important sources as well, namely: a) the 2009 Foreign Private Capital and Investor
Perception Survey, b) monetary statistics from the Reserve Bank of Malawi (RBM), and
c) other financial data provided by the Ministry of Finance (MoF). However, much remains
to be done to improve the quality, coverage, and timelines of the balance of payments
statistics.
13.
Data on remittances are non-existent, despite anecdotal evidence that there are high
remittances. As a first step the money transfer services should be required to report monthly
data to the RBM. Data on foreign direct investment and portfolio flows are similarly weak.
Project aid is currently classified as current transfers rather than in the capital account, and
several large in-kind projects are not captured in the balance of payments data properly.
14.
No international investment position statement is prepared. The RBM and Ministry of
Finance’s Debt and Aid Department need to improve reporting of monetary and external debt
data respectively.

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2001 Article IV Consultation with Malawi
On July 23, 2012, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded the
2012 Article IV Consultation with Malawi.1
Background
After averaging over 8 percent a year during 2007–10, real GDP growth in Malawi fell to
4.3 percent in 2011, reflecting the impact of severe foreign exchange shortages. The country’s
long standing foreign exchange problems intensified in 2011 because of lower tobacco export
earnings and cuts in external aid as several donors reduced their financial support to Malawi
when the authorities’ IMF-supported program went off track in the first half of 2011 and because
of human rights and governance concerns. Delays in making payments abroad led to the loss of
credit lines for several businesses, resulting in scaled down operations. A tightening of
restrictions on foreign exchange transactions created distortions which fostered a parallel
market in foreign exchange and boosted activity in the informal sector at the expense of the
formal economy. Fiscal performance deteriorated, with the deficit widening from nearly
3 percent of GDP in FY2010/11 to 7 percent in FY2011/12, with a commensurate increase in
domestic financing. The external current account deficit widened, reflecting slowing exports and
the drop in external grants, and the international reserve position weakened further.

1

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On
return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the
Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the

In May 2012, the new administration which assumed office in April under the leadership of
President Joyce Banda devalued the kwacha, adopted a floating exchange rate regime, and
liberalized current account transactions. The measures are beginning to show positive results
as evidenced by increased sales of tobacco through official channels, a considerable easing of
the private sector’s access to foreign exchange, and the near collapse of the foreign exchange
parallel market. The policy environment has improved markedly, as have the prospects for
reversing the slowdown in economic activity and exports.
Inflation has been on an upswing since early 2011, with the year-on-year rate reaching
17.3 percent in May 2012. Rising import costs have been the main factor behind the upswing,
as a growing share of imports were being priced at the parallel market exchange rate before the
May devaluation. The devaluation triggered large adjustments in the retail prices of petroleum
products, which have had ripple effects to other prices. Inflation is expected to rise for a few
months but with the implementation of restrained fiscal and monetary policies should begin to
fall by early 2013.
Risks to the medium-term outlook from global spillovers are moderate-to-low. Slower euro area
and world growth would adversely affect Malawi’s exports (mainly tobacco), but the overall
impact on Malawi’s growth is expected to be low because of the authorities’ active efforts
diversify exports and export markets. A substantial fall in tobacco prices on the other hand
would adversely affect export proceeds and the income of farmers and dampen growth. The
new government’s strong policy actions have reduced the risk of lower aid flows. Most of
Malawi’s major donors are restoring or scaling up aid in response to the improved policy
environment and the government’s efforts to repair strained relations by addressing concerns
over human rights abuses and governance.
Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors commended the new government for its strong commitment to reform, as
evidenced by the swift implementation of bold measures to address Malawi’s chronic balance of
payments problems and improve the outlook for poverty reduction and growth. The devaluation
of the kwacha, adoption of a floating exchange rate regime, and liberalization of current account
transactions have begun to show positive results, including increased access by the private
sector to foreign exchange. Given Malawi’s vulnerability to external shocks, Directors
considered that boosting international reserves from their current very low levels should be an
immediate policy priority.
Directors agreed that fiscal discipline and tight monetary policy will be required to ensure
that the nominal depreciation of the kwacha translates into a sustained real depreciation,
critical for improving external competitiveness. In this context, they commended the
authorities for the measures already taken to address internal imbalances, including the move

130
toward cost-recovery tariffs for utilities and adoption of an automatic adjustment mechanism to
ensure that the retail prices of petroleum products reflect import costs.
Directors welcomed the announcements of increased financial assistance by Malawi’s
development partners which will allow the government to implement programs to mitigate the
impact of the adjustment measures on the poor. They stressed the role of good economic
management for attracting and sustaining aid inflows.
Directors were encouraged by the prudent stance of the FY2012/13 budget, and welcomed the
scaling up of social protection programs. They advised the authorities to ensure that spending
plans are in line with expected revenues and grants, and that they reflect Malawi’s growth and
development priorities. To make progress toward longer-term fiscal sustainability, Directors
welcomed the authorities’ intention to strengthen domestic revenue mobilization and public
financial management to better control commitments and avoid the accumulation of expenditure
arrears.
Directors agreed that tight monetary policy is needed to contain inflationary pressures following
the devaluation of the kwacha. They looked forward to further steps to strengthen the
operational independence of the RBM, and commended the authorities’ plan to introduce limits
on government borrowing from the RBM. While Malawi’s banking system is sound, close
monitoring to preserve financial stability should continue.
Directors welcomed the approval of the second Malawi Growth and Development Strategy
(MGDS II), on which the new program is based. They supported the objective of promoting
inclusive growth by improving the business climate, addressing key supply-side bottlenecks,
deepening access to finance and strengthening social safety nets. They also recommended
careful prioritization of the many programs and projects in MDGS II, given limited resources
and constraints in institutional capacity.

Press Release No. 12/273
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
July 23, 2012

International Monetary Fund
Washington, D.C. 20431 USA

IMF Executive Board Approves New US$ 156.2 Million Extended Credit Facility
Arrangement for Malawi
The Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) today approved a new three-year
arrangement for Malawi under the Extended Credit Facility (ECF) in an amount equivalent to
SDR 104.1 million (about US$ 156.2 million). The Board’s decision will enable an immediate
disbursement equivalent to SDR 13.02 million (about US$ 19.5 million). The Board also took
note of the authorities’ cancellation of the arrangement under the ECF which was approved on
February 19, 2010 (See Press Release No. 10/52).
The government’s medium-term economic program supported by the ECF arrangement is
based on Malawi’s second Growth and Development Strategy (MGDS II). The program is
aimed at the achievement and maintenance of macroeconomic stability and implementation
of policies and structural reforms to spur growth, diversify the economy and reduce poverty.
Following the Board’s discussion of Malawi, Naoyuki Shinohara, Deputy Managing Director
and Acting Chair, issued the following statement:
“Malawi’s new administration moved swiftly to devalue the kwacha, adopt a flexible
exchange rate regime and liberalize current account transactions to address the country’s
chronic balance of payment problems and improve the outlook for poverty reduction and
growth.
“The new ECF arrangement provides support for the authorities’ medium-term economic
program based on Malawi’s second Growth and Development Strategy (MGDS II). Specific
objectives of the program include macroeconomic stability with low inflation, increasing
international reserves to provide a buffer against external shocks, and reforms to improve the
investment climate and promote sustained inclusive growth.
“The authorities have adopted a prudent fiscal stance in the 2012/13 budget. Higher donor
support and a sizeable domestic revenue effort allow the government to increase total
spending slightly without recourse to domestic borrowing. Tight control over non-priority
spending will be needed to ensure that expenditures are aligned with the government’s
priorities, including scaled up spending on social protection programs to mitigate the impact
of adjustment measures on the poor.

133

“In order to achieve fiscal sustainability, the program includes measures to enhance domestic
revenue mobilization and public financial management reforms to strengthen the budget
process and avoid the accumulation of arrears.
“Monetary policy will be geared to achieving price stability, while providing room for
sufficient credit to the private sector and supporting a build-up of international reserves.
Reforms will include measures to increase the operational independence of the RBM. The
RBM will continue to strengthen its monitoring and surveillance of the financial system.
“The program supports the authorities’ multifaceted approach to promoting growth,
including measures to deepen the financial system and to enhance Malawi’s international
competitiveness by addressing key supply-side bottlenecks in energy and transport
infrastructure,” Mr. Shinohara added.
Annex
Recent economic developments
Malawi faced serious macroeconomic challenges in the last two years, including a severe
shortage of foreign exchange, which translated into shortages of critical imports such as fuel,
inputs for production, and medicines. As a result, real GDP growth slowed to 4.3 percent in
2011, from an average annual rate of 8.3 percent during 2007–10. Inflation has been on an
upswing since early 2011, with the year-on-year headline rate reaching 20.1 percent in
June 2012. The current account balance (including transfers) has fluctuated widely, driven
mainly by aid flows and terms of trade.
The new administration formed in April 2012 moved swiftly to begin addressing the
country’s chronic balance of payments problems. Specific measures implemented include:
devaluation of the exchange rate; adoption of a floating exchange rate regime; liberalization
of the market. The adjustment measures are beginning to show positive results. Sales of
tobacco through official channels have increased and the private sector’s access to foreign
exchange, including for fuel imports, has eased considerably
Program Summary
The specific objectives of the government’s program include:


Achievement and maintenance of a stable macroeconomic environment with low
inflation.



Increasing useable international reserves from the equivalent of about one month of
imports at end-2012 to 3 months of imports by end-2015.



Boosting real GDP growth from 4.3 percent in 2012 to at least 6½ percent per year
from 2015.

134


Scaling up social protection programs to mitigate the adverse impact of adjustment
measures on the most vulnerable segments of the population.

Key elements of the strategy for achieving these objectives include:


Fiscal policy geared to strengthening domestic revenue mobilization, keeping
government spending within available resources (domestic revenues, grants, and
highly concessional external loans) and in line with government priorities, and
reducing domestic debt.



Enhanced operational independence of the Reserve Bank of Malawi to enable it
pursue the objective of achieving low inflation and building up international reserves
from current very low levels.



Structural reforms to deepen the financial system and make it more inclusive, and
measures to enhance the investment climate and international competitiveness,
including improving transport infrastructure and energy supply.

Statement by Mr. Moeketsi Majoro, Executive Director for Malawi
July 23, 2012
My Malawi authorities are appreciative of the Fund Executive Board and Management for
their continued engagement and support. They are grateful for the productive policy dialogue
and advice proffered by the Fund Mission during the 2012 Article IV consultation and
negotiations for a new ECF arrangement. My authorities agree broadly with the staff report
as it presents a generally balanced assessment of recent macroeconomic developments, and
challenges and opportunities. It is in this regard that my authorities solicit the support and
approval of the Executive Board for a new three-year ECF arrangement.
Since taking office in April, President Banda has taken bold decisions setting on a journey of
economic recovery, initiated a number of reforms and made efforts to improve Malawi's
diplomatic relations, which deteriorated sharply in the last few years, costing the country
hundreds of millions of dollars in foreign aid exacerbating the already fragile economy. The
efforts are paying off, as donors such as the United Kingdom and United States have restored
their financial support, and others are in the process of doing so.
Recent Economic Developments
Malawi’s economy slowed considerably in 2011, after recording impressive growth rates
which averaged 8 percent per year during the 2007–10 period. Real GDP grew at 4.3 percent
in 2011 and is projected to grow at the same pace in 2012. The slowdown in growth was
evident in manufacturing, transport, construction, retail and wholesale sectors which were
adversely affected by foreign exchange shortages. Inflation has been rising since early 2011,
with the year-on-year headline rate reaching 17.3 percent in May 2012 owing to rising import
costs as more and more imports were being priced at the parallel market exchange rate in the
run up to the May devaluation. Needless to say, the 49 percent devaluation and the
subsequent pass-through to energy prices are affecting virtually all sectors of the economy.
The authorities have taken a pro-active approach to dealing with the challenges facing the
country. Their commitment to placing the economy on a steady path of recovery is
demonstrated by their recent policy actions aimed at addressing critical foreign exchange
shortages. The buildup of international reserves and the introduction of a more flexible
exchange rate regime and liberalized foreign exchange market are important elements of their
policy framework. They recognize that a responsive exchange rate is essential in aiding the
economy to better respond to external shocks, similar to those experienced last year, while
strengthening their ability to accumulate reserves and contribute to a high sustainable
economic growth.
The immediate impacts of the policy interventions are being observed. The devaluation, the
adoption of a floating exchange rate regime, and the lifting of several restrictions on foreign

136
exchange transactions have virtually eliminated the parallel market. Intervention in the
foreign exchange market by the Reserve Bank of Malawi has helped to clear some of the
backlog of external payments while tightening liquidity conditions in the domestic market.
all the same time, support for the policy changes from the private sector has been positive:
exporters hailed the boost to their incomes in Kwacha terms, importers are optimistic about
the prospects for increased availability of foreign exchange, and commercial banks have
recorded an increase in purchases of foreign exchange from their customers. While
adjustments in exchange rates have had a positive impact on the balance of payments, the
BoP remains under increasing risk and vulnerability, particularly in light of export growth
subsiding with the economic slow-down in major trading partners like the EU.
In addition to the foreign exchange reforms, the Reserve Bank started tightening its monetary
policy stance in April 2012 by removing excess liquidity using some of its holdings of
treasury bills. After the devaluation, foreign exchange sales assisted in mopping up excess
liquidity; Kwacha liquidity conditions tightened significantly. In May, the Bank raised its
policy rate from 13 percent to 16 percent and increased it further to 21 percent on July 11,
2012. The adjustments are part of the measures aimed at strengthening monetary policy in
the context of a liberalized exchange rate regime and are in line with the increasing trends in
non-food inflation.
Policies to Address Imbalances
The authorities are keenly aware of the seriousness of the current macroeconomic imbalances
manifested in rising inflation and low reserves as they are of the need to maintain their progrowth policies and meet the long-term development challenges. They have thus continued to
tackle the effect of the devaluation while simultaneously undertaking a broad range of
concerted fiscal and monetary policies to address the vulnerabilities. They are committed to
attaining and maintaining short term stability as they pursue long range structural
transformation and reform. In this context they are committed to addressing inflationary
pressures and building up of reserves as a matter of priority.
Fiscal Policy
The authorities have made a strong commitment to tighten fiscal policy by passing a budget
for FY2012/13 that is in line with a deficit of 1.1 percent of GDP and consistent with their
objective to reduce domestic borrowing, contain expenditure and strengthen revenue
collection. The budget represents a sharp tightening compared to the 2011/12 budget with a
deficit of 7.3 percent of GDP.
To this end, the authorities have eliminated the fuel subsidy program and are implementing a
policy of monthly adjustment of pump prices. The domestic fuel price mechanism would
build into the pump rice a small margin in order to repay the accrued negative balance in the
Petroleum Stabilization Fund. In this regard, for the month of July 2012, MERA has revised

137
downwards pump prices of three petroleum products by an average of about 7 percent,
effective July 6, 2012, in line with the Automatic Pricing Mechanism (APM) following
trends in the world petroleum products prices.
Taxes that are deemed to be punitive on businesses and regressive in nature would be
removed, the range of items subject to VAT are being expanded and social protection
programs such as FISP, public works, school feeding, and cash transfers have been increased
to mitigate the effect of high prices on the poor in a more effective way while ensuring food
security. The authorities have also resolved to rein in contingent liabilities and operational
losses emanating from public enterprises and intensify monitoring. The authorities have
indicated a willingness to cut lower priority expenditure, and in some instances even
postpone investment spending if these do not compromise their commitment to the poor and
achievement of the MDGs.
To ensure that risks to the budget are minimized, particularly in light of the large domestic
arrears accumulation over the last few years, my authorities will tighten control over
expenditure commitments and accelerate the implementation of the commitment module in
the IFMIS. At the same time, the government has started clearing the accumulated domestic
arrears and is looking into alternatives such as long-term Treasury bonds to settle some of
these arrears.
My authorities will continue to pursue prudent fiscal policy aimed at safeguarding medium to
long-term debt sustainability while, at the same time, creating the required fiscal space for
investment in infrastructure and the social sectors. Their medium-term agenda will be
defined by priorities set out in the MDGS II that emphasize increased budgetary allocations
to the development of basic infrastructure and the efficient provision of social services,
within a stable macroeconomic environment. In this regard, maintenance of prudent fiscal
policies and consolidation of gains in macroeconomic stability will remain at the top of the
authorities’ economic agenda. Furthermore, fiscal policy will be aimed at containing public
debt and related interest payments to sustainable levels.
Monetary and Exchange Rate Policies
To anchor inflationary expectations, monetary policy in 2012/13 will continue to be
consistent with the level of economic activities so as to curb inflation and anchor inflation
expectations. The policy stance will be supported by fiscal consolidation and reduced access
by government to direct credit from the central bank. To this end my authorities intend to
amend the RBM act to place a limit on total borrowing by the Government from RBM.
Going forward, the Reserve Bank will continue to pursue prudent monetary policies to
strengthen the recovery process and consolidate the gains achieved so far. Monetary policy
will be geared towards accumulating foreign exchange reserves and creating an interest rate
structure conducive to economic growth.

138

The central bank will continue to maintain the current floating exchange rate regime and
intervene in the market only to preserve orderly market conditions. While mostly abstaining
from the foreign exchange market, the RBM will, however, continue to carry out limited
foreign exchange interventions to mop up liquidity generated by donor financed spending.
Debt Management Policy
My authorities concur with staff’s assessment that Malawi remains at a moderate risk of debt
distress. They are cognizant of the threat to debt sustainability in the event of shocks to the
economy. It is in this regard that my authorities remain unwaveringly committed to the
careful management of both external and domestic debt to enhance external stability and
increase fiscal savings. They will source new borrowing from highly concessional windows
and create the enabling environment to attract non-debt creating resource inflows. In
addition, my authorities will continue conducting debt sustainability analysis on the basis of
the Fund-Bank framework to ensure that all debt indicators fall and remain within their
corresponding thresholds. Furthermore, to maintain the continued prudent management of
public debt, debt management capacity is being enhanced and will carry on fiscal
consolidation to slow down the growth in the domestic debt stock.
Conclusion
My authorities remain mindful of the importance of prudent fiscal and monetary policies to
ward off inflationary pressures due to devaluation as well as fuel price adjustment and
achieve and maintain macroeconomic stability. The authorities are committed to the
implementation of their MDGS II which is succeeding in generating meaningful growth and
reducing poverty. The growth strategy which focuses on developing agriculture and other
productive sectors, building infrastructure, expanding the service sector and developing
human resources has garnered solid support from Malawi’s development partners. In this
respect, the authorities will take into consideration and address the main risks identified in
the staff advisory note and the recommendations to strengthen the implementation of the
MDGS II as they prepare the first Annual Progress Report. These partners are, in addition to
their support for the MDGS II, also ready to provide and in some instances have already
extended additional assistance to help mitigate the impact of the devaluation.
My authorities recognize that the immediate priority for the coming months is to address the
impact of the devaluation as well as fuel price adjustment and address the associated
vulnerabilities. The new administration inherited an economy on the decline and the needed
policy adjustments while unavoidable have exacerbated existing weaknesses and
vulnerabilities. In this context and with bold actions taken so far and planned policy
initiatives, the Malawi authorities request cancellation of the current ECF program and
request access to Fund resources under an ECF in the amount of SDR 104.1 million
(150 percent of quota) over a three-year period to meet in part the BOP financing needs and

139
to provide a buffer against shocks until the policy adjustments and reform measures take
hold. They also take the opportunity to confirm that they are committed to implement the
policies as outlined in the MEFP. The authorities strongly believe that the various reform
programs meant to revamp economic and financial management will help re-establish
macroeconomic stability and improve growth prospects. During this time, they expect to
secure support from other development partners to meet their overall financing needs. They
believe that their commitments, as outlined in the MEFP and highlighted above, are adequate
to achieve program objectives, but are prepared to take further measures, as appropriate, for
this purpose. To ensure a strong performance under an ECF-supported arrangement, they will
maintain a close policy dialogue with the IMF and pursue technical assistance, as necessary,
from the IMF and other development partners in support of the reform agenda. They expect
the ECF-supported arrangement would put them in a better position to undertake the broad
long-term reforms that they believe necessary to resume and sustain the robust growth in the
face of complex and difficult challenges. They value the Fund’s financial support as well as
the advice and appreciate the encouragement the institution provides to other development
partners in their engagement with Malawi
