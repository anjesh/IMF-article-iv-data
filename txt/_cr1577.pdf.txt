STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2015 ARTICLE IV CONSULTATION

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
Ireland’s recovery has been robust. Growth is estimated at about 5 percent in 2014,
although offshore manufacturing of exports appears to have made a significant
contribution. The unemployment rate has declined to 10½ percent, down from a peak of
15 percent three years ago, with long-term unemployment falling notably though still
unduly high. Private balance sheet health is improving and enterprise profitability has
risen, yet distressed loans remain high and arrears are increasingly prolonged.
Property markets are bouncing back rapidly. Commercial real estate values are up
30.7 percent y/y in 2014, though they still remain about 30 percent below pre-boom
levels. Values were bolstered by record transaction volumes with over one-third reflecting
foreign investment inflows. At the same time, house prices rose 16.3 percent y/y, as fast as
the increases during the boom period, though they are still 38 percent below peak.
The priority is to ensure that solid growth and job creation is sustained. Near-term
growth prospects appear bright at about 3½ percent y/y in 2015. Solid growth needs to
be maintained to further reduce unemployment. To achieve that Ireland should:


Balance its budget over the cycle through a phased and steady adjustment. Fiscal
balance will ensure that growth erodes Ireland’s high public debt burden. An
adjustment phased over three years would limit the drag on recovery.



Implement a policy mix to achieve steady fiscal adjustment that protects growth
potential. Both the expenditure and revenue sides can support adjustment and help
create room to rebuild public investment. Rigorous assessment of the quality of
capital projects is needed to ensure this investment helps to avoid growth bottlenecks.



Facilitate a revival of financing flows in support of investment and recovery.
Cases of prolonged loan arrears need to be tackled more vigorously. Banks should
address capital quality issues early to safeguard lending capacity. Scope to further
develop nonbank financing should be explored, especially risk capital for SMEs.



Strengthen the financial resilience of banks and borrowers to shocks while
tempering Ireland’s property cycles. Recent regulations of mortgage origination are
welcome. Supervision should also ensure bank exposures to commercial property risks
are appropriately contained. Reforms to improve the performance of the construction
sector and the depth of rental property markets would help temper property cycles.

FOCUSING ON THE MEDIUM TERM
1.
Ireland’s recovery has been robust—the priority now is to ensure that solid growth
and job creation is sustained. As discussed below, Ireland’s recovery is off to a good start in
2013–14, with some of the adverse legacies from the crisis beginning to heal. Near-term growth
prospects appear bright and the fiscal deficit is expected to fall below 3 percent of GDP in 2015,
enabling Ireland to exit the EU’s Excessive Deficit Procedure (EDP). But at 10.4 percent in Q4, the
rate of unemployment is still well above its pre-crisis average of 4½ percent. Strong growth and
job creation is therefore needed for a number of years, entailing a significant rise in investment
including construction. In that context, the Article IV focuses on:


Fiscal adjustment after EDP exit. A new post-EDP medium-term fiscal framework is needed
as Budget 2016 will likely be Ireland’s first under the preventative arm of the SGP.



Macro-financial policies for durable recovery. Rising investment requires increased
lending yet vulnerabilities must be contained to protect the durability of recovery.

2.
The discussions took place against some settling in the political situation. Elections
are due no later than early April 2016. Polls in early 2015 show a rise in support for the coalition
parties and the water charges issue appears to becoming less heated after the November 2014
steps to lower fees and set a cap to reduce uncertainty about future charges. Developments in
Greece are being watched closely given Ireland’s large outstanding debt to its European partners.

RECOVERY IS OFF TO A GOOD START
Exports and investment drove a strong recovery in 2014 and indicators suggest solid momentum
into 2015. Property prices are bouncing back sharply despite low credit growth, driven in part by
international investment. Some crisis legacies are beginning to heal, including unemployment,
private balance sheets and bank health, yet substantial nonperforming loans remain to be resolved.
3.
Ireland’s economic recovery is
starting to fire on all cylinders. Real
GDP rose by 4.9 percent y/y in Q1–Q3
2014, with net exports generating
two-thirds of this expansion and
investment being the other main
contributor. The export surge partly
reflects offshore manufacturing under
contract, contributing perhaps as much
as 2 percentage points to growth (Box 1).
Ireland’s export performance was strong
even excluding this factor, benefitting
from U.S. and U.K. trade linkages and
improved competitiveness (Annex I).

Box 1. Contract Manufacturing and Trade Performance in 2014
In 2014, multinational enterprises (MNEs) operating in Ireland made greater use of offshore
manufacturing under contract. As a base for many of the large pharmaceutical and information
technology companies
operating in Europe, Ireland
is highly exposed to the
fragmentation of the global
supply chain. As depicted in
this chart, the booking of
export sales in Ireland
sometimes reflects a more
complex process whereby
products are manufactured
in a country A subsidiary,
packaged in country B and
sold to country C customers,
while generating royalty
payments to country D for
use of intellectual property.
Goods produced through contracted manufacturing
agreements are treated differently in the national
accounts than in customs measures of trade. As these
goods do not cross the Irish border, they are not included
in customs data on exports. If, however, the goods remain
under the ownership of the Irish company, they are
recorded as exports in the national accounts. Payments for
manufacturing services and patent and royalty payments
are service imports in the national accounts, offsetting in
part the positive GDP impact of contracted manufacturing.

difficult to make a precise estimate. Customs data on
goods exports rose by 2.8 percent y/y in volume terms in the first nine months of 2014. In contrast,
national accounts data on exports rose 12 percent in the same period. The gap between these two
export measures can be attributed in part to contracted production, but could also reflect other factors
like warehousing (goods produced in Ireland but stored and sold overseas) and valuation effects.
Assuming conservatively that contract manufacturing accounted for about half of the difference
between customs and national accounts data, the implied gross contribution to GDP growth in the first
three quarters of 2014 from contract manufacturing is 2 percentage points. However, there is a need to
take into account the likelihood that service imports were higher than otherwise, but it is not possible to
identify the volume of additional service imports linked to contract manufacturing.

The pickup in investment and employment that began in H2 2012 is starting to be supported by
consumption, with retail sales excluding autos up 3.6 percent y/y in 2014 (Figure 1).

Property markets are bouncing back rapidly from their lows but valuations do not
yet appear stretched:
Commercial property values and rents are rising rapidly, in part reflecting international
investments. Capital values rose 30.7 percent y/y in Q4 2014, the fastest growth since 1999,
although price levels are still 56 percent below peak and still about 30 percent below
pre-boom levels. Rental growth of 19.7 percent y/y was largely driven by strong demand for
Dublin office space reflected in falling vacancy rates and a 31 percent y/y increase in office
rents. From almost 10 percent in early 2012, initial rental yields on commercial property have
declined substantially to 6 percent in Q4 2014, yet they are still somewhat above the
5.2 percent yield in the U.K., and the premium over the 0.84 percent yield on 10-year
government bonds remains sizable. The volume of turnover in Irish commercial real estate in
2014 was higher than in the mid 2000s, with 37.5 percent from offshore investors.



A recent survey finds household debts concentrated among families with mortgages, having
2 to 3 children, with the reference person aged 35 to 44, and in the two top income quintiles.
Yet, their debt servicing burden is still similar to other groups, reflecting the high share of
long-term “tracker” mortgages, with an average interest rate of 1.05 percent at end 2014.



The share of mortgages on primary dwellings in arrears for over 90 days declined to
14.8 percent in Q4 2014, from a peak of 17.3 percent five quarters earlier (Figure 2). Staff
estimates that some 4.4 percent of households have mortgages in arrears. However,
prolonged arrears (over 720 days) rose to just over half of mortgages in arrears over 90 days,
with arrears outstanding on these mortgages accounting for 78 percent of total arrears over
90 days. In the case of buy-to-let property, mortgages in arrears remain exceptionally high at
29.4 percent of loans. (Box 1 in the Second PPM report provides further details.)

8.
Rising earnings of Irish enterprises appear to be limiting their needs for external
financing at this stage in the recovery. In the year to Q3 2014, Irish private enterprises

reflect a combination of reduced
competition, pricing for higher risk on those SMEs that need to borrow, and a shift from
financing of working capital toward lending for investment. Some 25.4 percent of SME loans are
in default, but 41.2 percent by value given high default rates on larger loans.
9.
Bank health is benefiting from favorable funding conditions and property market
recovery yet challenges remain in loan resolution and the transition to Basel III:


Domestic banks returned to profitability in the first half of 2014 for the first time since
2008 and reports show continued improvements. Operating income growth reflected a
fall in costs on both deposits and market funding. Provisioning expenses fell by two-thirds in
2014 H1 as impaired assets stabilized and increases in property prices also contributed.
These trends continued for the full year based on financial reporting by AIB and BoI.



Though declining, NPLs remain very elevated at one-quarter of outstanding loans. By
Q2 2014 NPLs had fallen 12 percent from their peak in Q3 2013, largely as a result of
write-offs and disposals. The authorities note that headline NPL figures overstate the scale of

8

IRELAND

distress, as even after a workout plan is in place, the portion of impaired loans expected to
be serviced after a workout remains as an NPL until the remaining debt is written off.


Capital adequacy has risen but the transition to Basel III capital rules will require action.
CET1 ratios of domestic banks averaged a strong 13.4 percent in June 2014, although this
partly reflects lower risk weighted assets due to loan repayments. However, Irish banks have
significant balance sheet items—such as deferred tax assets and preference shares—that will,
under CRD IV, be netted out from equity in the calculation of the capital adequacy ratio after
transition periods of some years.

BRIGHT PROSPECTS CLOUDED BY RISKS
Prospects for a self-sustaining recovery appear favorable although euro area developments present
risks in the near and medium term. The ECB’s quantitative easing is of particular benefit given
Ireland’s strong trade outside the euro area and the ongoing need to address debt overhangs.
10.
Growth is projected to moderate to 3½ percent in 2015 and to gradually ease to a
2½ percent pace. With the latest WEO maintaining

growth of about 3½ percent in the medium term
mostly reflects lower import growth, and on the supply side is underpinned by higher
productivity growth than the 1 percent pace staff assumes (based on OECD research placing
Ireland in the “close to frontier” economies) together with faster employment growth.
11.
This growth and investment outlook will increasingly require credit flows in the
medium term, with banks expected to play the main role. Despite the strong growth in 2014,
bank credit to the private sector declined by about 5 percent y/y, similar to the declines in
previous years of weak or negative growth. But rising investment is expected to increase
financing needs over time, with initial signs of such a pick up seen in mortgage approvals
(Figure 2). This outlook is consistent with expectations of major Irish banks for loan balances to
stabilize and for credit to then grow broadly in line with GDP in the medium term. Gross lending
volumes would be larger, and together with continued financing by retained earnings and FDI,
would support investment while avoiding the past high reliance on wholesale funding.

Ireland’s market access is robust and on highly favorable terms, reflecting its
improved economic outlook and euro area developments including quantitative easing.

medium term, the authorities have in the past successfully smoothed amortization humps.
13.
Ireland’s external position is sustainable and the economy remains competitive.
EBA’s three approaches suggest that the current account and the real exchange rate are in line
with economic fundamentals and desired policy setting (Annex I). The Current Account and
External Sustainability approaches suggest a small undervaluation, but this may reflect the
treatment of retained earnings of redomiciled firms. The small overvaluation on an REER basis in
2014 has been unwound by the recent euro depreciation. Competitiveness is strong in the
services export sector, albeit driven by industries with relatively low domestic value added.

14.
Risks to Ireland’s growth prospects are broadly balanced within a wide range, with
key sources being (Box 2):


Financial market volatility could be triggered by a range of factors, yet Ireland’s
vulnerability appears to be contained. Financial conditions are currently exceptionally
favorable for both the sovereign and banks. A reassessment of sovereign risk in Europe or
geopolitical developments could result in renewed volatility and spread widening. But market
developments currently suggest contagion to Ireland would be contained by OMT and PSPP.



Yet continued easy international financial conditions could lead to vulnerabilities in the
medium term. For example, if the international search for yield drove up Irish commercial
property prices, risks of an eventual slump in prices and construction would increase,
weakening economic activity and potentially impacting domestic banks.



Euro area stagnation would impede exports. Export projections are below the average
growth in the past five years of 4¾ percent, implying some upside especially given recent
euro depreciation. Yet Ireland is vulnerable to stagnation of the euro area, which accounts for
40 percent of exports. Over time, international action on corporate taxation could reduce
Ireland’s attractiveness for some export-oriented FDI, but the authorities see limited risks in
practice given other competitive advantages and as the corporate tax rate is not affected.



Domestic demand could sustain its recent momentum, yet concerns remain around
possible weak lending in the medium term. Consumption growth may exceed the pace
projected in coming years given improving property and labor market conditions. However,
domestic demand recovery could in time be hindered by a weak lending revival if Basel III
capital requirements became binding owing to insufficient bank profits, or if slow NPL
resolution were to limit the redeployment of capital to profitable new loans.

15.
Public debt remains high and growth shortfalls are the key risk to the debt outlook.
From 123 percent in 2013, public debt fell notably in 2014 to an estimated 111 percent of GDP
(Annex II accounts for this fall). Under the baseline, gross debt falls below 100 percent of GDP in

POLICIES FOR SUSTAINED RECOVERY
Ireland has an opportunity to achieve the lasting recovery needed to reverse high unemployment
and other crisis legacies. Steady and phased fiscal adjustment to reach budget balance would avoid
undue drag on growth while putting the high public debt burden on a downward path. A coherent
set of financial and property-related policies are needed to help revive lending while protecting the
resilience of banks and borrowers and moderating property cycles to some extent.

A. Fiscal Policy
16.
Strong revenues reduced the fiscal deficit to about 4 percent of GDP in 2014
despite significant primary spending overruns. At 3.9 percent of GDP, the estimated deficit is
0.9 percentage points below the budget target. An upward revision to GDP from the transition to
ESA 2010 contributed 0.3 percentage points to this outperformance. The remaining
0.6 percentage points reflect revenue gains (1.3 percent of GDP) and interest savings (0.4 percent

spending exceeded budget owing to the extra
cost of setting up Irish Water and a frontloading of some spending from 2015.
17.
Budget 2015 entails modest structural adjustment and firm expenditure control will be
critical. Budget 2015 targets an overall deficit of 2.7 percent of GDP, below the EDP ceiling of
3 percent of GDP, a major milestone in Ireland’s fiscal consolidation efforts, which staff estimates
have totaled 13 percent of GDP in structural primary adjustment from 2008 to 2015. Staff projects a
decline in the overall deficit of 1.2 percentage point of GDP in 2015, aided by strong growth
(0.4 percent of GDP), interest bill reductions (0.4 percent of GDP), and one-off revenues (0.1 percent
of GDP), leaving 0.3 percent of GDP in primary structural adjustment. A firmer adjustment would
have been preferable given high debt and strong near-term growth prospects. Avoiding a repetition
of 2014 overruns, especially in healthcare, is needed to achieve this modest adjustment in 2015. In
particular, revenue overperformance or a lower interest bill in 2015 should be used to reduce the
deficit, rather than covering higher primary spending. The proceeds from disposals of stakes in the
banks should be dedicated to debt reduction. In case Eurostat were to classify Irish Water as part of
the government—with a deficit impact of 0.3 percent of GDP—any offsetting measures taken by the
authorities should be high quality and durable.

Framework for Fiscal Adjustment after EDP Exit
18.
As Ireland exits the EDP, it should establish a medium-term fiscal goal of balancing
the budget over the cycle. Fiscal balance will ensure that growth progressively erodes Ireland’s
high public debt burden over time, underpinning confidence to invest and create jobs. Declining
debt will also rebuild the fiscal space needed to allow Ireland to cushion future shocks to growth.
Moreover, maintaining a balanced budget over the cycle will reduce the risk of the fiscal stance
amplifying economic fluctuations, as was historically common in Ireland.
19.
To protect recovery, the pace of fiscal adjustment after 2015 should be phased and
steady. On staff estimates, GDP is still expected to be about 1½ percent below potential in
2015—although output gaps estimates are subject to significant uncertainty. Hence the deficit in
structural terms is estimated at 2¼ percent of GDP in 2015. With the interest bill projected to
decline by 0.3 percentage points of GDP in the medium term, primary adjustment totaling about
1.9 percent of GDP is needed to reach overall balance in structural terms. Phasing that remaining
adjustment over a three year period would limit average structural primary adjustment to some
0.6 percent of GDP annually, with a modest drag on growth. Pacing this adjustment evenly, at no
less than ½ percent of GDP per annum, would enhance economic stability and steady the limited
room available for budgetary initiatives from year to year, making adjustment more manageable.
20.
The rules of the SGP’s preventative arm will in principle support such an approach
to fiscal adjustment. The Expenditure Benchmark and the Structural Adjustment rules provide
intermediate targets consistent with a steady fiscal adjustment toward the Medium-Term
Objective of budget balance in structural terms. Importantly, stronger than budgeted revenues
will no longer permit supplementary spending in the same year, as the Expenditure Benchmark
will put a firm lid on spending while still allowing the automatic stabilizers to operate fully.
21.
Yet, Irish-specific technical issues in applying these fiscal rules should be addressed.
As discussed in Chapter 1 of the Selected Issues Paper, in Ireland’s case, the current EU
methodology understates cyclical swings in unemployment, with implications for estimates of
output gaps and potential growth. Staff therefore welcomes ongoing work by the Irish
authorities to refine some aspects of the EC methodology. Assessments of compliance with the
rules by the EC and IFAC will also need to take into account Ireland’s large MNE sector, which has
activity swings with a sizable impact on GDP, but notably less impact on revenues and fiscal
balances than other GDP shocks. Staff is therefore basing its estimates of the output gap used to
calculate structural balances on a measure of GDP excluding the sectors dominated by MNEs.
22.
Authorities’ views. The authorities recognized that a clear fiscal framework for the period
after Ireland’s forthcoming exit from the EDP is important. They agreed that balancing the budget
in structural terms is a sound fiscal goal for Ireland in the medium term. They found the discussions
on the pace of transition to balance helpful in developing their perspective on this issue, where they
are firmly committed to a structural adjustment of at least ½ percent of GDP annually from 2016
onwards. In that respect, they are working closely with the EC to refine the potential GDP
methodology for Ireland to support sound and reasonable implementation of the fiscal rules.

14

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

IRELAND

Policies to Underpin Fiscal Adjustment
23.
The policy mix to achieve steady fiscal adjustment should protect Ireland’s growth
potential. Under the authorities’ current projections, further fiscal adjustment is primarily driven
by expenditure restraint, as set out in the Comprehensive Expenditure Report 2015–17. Capital
spending remains low in the medium term, at just under 1½ percent of GDP. Staff sees scope for
both the expenditure and revenue sides to support adjustment: revenue measures would help
create room to rebuild capital spending over time and they could also be needed in response to
evolving international tax standards such as the BEPS project.
24.
Expenditure reforms are needed to deliver core public services at manageable cost
in the face of demographic pressures. Demographic pressures—from both young and old age
groups—on education, health, and pension spending total about ¼ percent of GDP per annum
over the medium term. A range of efforts are needed deliver the additional services required
within a manageable overall spending envelope:


Public wage bill. The expiry of the Haddington Road Agreement in 2016 will lead to
pressures for some reversal of past savings that were key to Ireland’s consolidation to date.
There are risks that these pressures impede progress to fiscal balance: any developments on
future public sector wage arrangements must recognize the very tight fiscal constraints in
coming years. Further cost reductions and service delivery improvements through
implementation of the Public Service Reform Plan 2014–16 should also be sought.



Social protection. An expansion in social protection spending was essential in the crisis and
it is important that this spending declines steadily as the economy recovers. There is also
scope to generate savings while protecting those on low incomes through means-testing of
benefits and taxation of universal benefits. For instance, the distribution of medical cards to
persons aged over 70 could be made conditional on income and the universal component of
child benefits could be progressively reduced by treating it as a taxable income.



Healthcare. Despite its relatively young population, Ireland’s health spending (on a real per
capita PPP-adjusted basis) exceeded the OECD average by 12 percent in 2012 while life
expectancy is little above the OECD average. Cost efficiency in healthcare should be further
improved by building on existing initiatives: high use of costly acute care should be reduced
through expanded primary care and further pharmaceutical savings should be sought.



Education. Ireland had the third greatest annual expenditure per student in OECD countries
by public educational institutions in 2011, some 14 percent above the OECD average on a
PPP-adjusted basis. Higher education funding reforms are needed to control growth in public
spending while protecting low income students, by better targeting college fee subsidies.

25.
The amount and quality of capital spending should be reviewed carefully in order
to ensure adequate maintenance and avoid growth bottlenecks. A gradual rise in public
investment may be required once the fiscal position is closer to balance, while ensuring the

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

15

IRELAND

quality of investments through rigorous project assessment. Structural reforms that boost growth
can benefit the fiscal position over time, yet may have up-front costs including investment needs.
It would be appropriate to explore the scope for well specified structural reforms with credible
timelines and growth benefits to qualify for the flexibility available within the EU fiscal rules.
26.
Revenue efforts should build on the base-broadening reforms achieved in recent
years. Ireland’s vulnerability to a crisis was exacerbated by its formerly high reliance on a narrow
tax base, especially real estate transactions. The substantial progress since made in broadening
the tax base needs to be protected going forward. Reforms to broaden the VAT base could
significantly bolster revenues without raising the main VAT rate—even closing one-quarter of the
“policy gap” could generate 1 percent of GDP in additional revenue (see Table 10 of the October
2013 Fiscal Monitor). Moreover, maintaining up to date housing valuations will protect the
property tax base and help lean against housing market cycles. The large drop in oil prices
creates an opportunity to generate revenues by raising environmentally friendly taxes. The recent
report on tax expenditures should guide a review over time of the remaining tax expenditures.
27.
Authorities’ views. Regarding the composition of adjustment toward fiscal balance, the
authorities noted that there could be a role for further broadening of the tax base, but they also
considered it important to address high marginal income tax rates. They agreed on the need to
protect the gains from previous revenue and spending measures and to implement a policy mix
which continues to be supportive of growth and employment. On the spending side, they noted that
demographic pressures had been accounted for in developing expenditure projections, and they
fully recognized the need for ongoing reforms and continued discipline across spending areas. A
review of capital expenditure was in progress. The authorities are actively engaged in the BEPS
project and are closely monitoring the evolution of international tax standards with a view to
ensuring compliance with best international practice.

B. Macro-financial Policies

Policies to revive financing need to be complemented by measures to promote the
resilience of banks and borrowers. A revival of

Facilitating a Revival of Financing Flows
29.
There is a risk that Irish banks will have high NPLs for a lengthy period. Although
substantial mortgage restructuring was implemented during 2013–14 under the CBI’s Mortgage
Arrears Resolution Targets (MART) framework, by September 2014 resolution was yet to
conclude in about half of mortgage arrears cases, with a further one-tenth of cases under
repossession proceedings to be completed. This overall slow resolution progress is reflected in
the rising share of prolonged arrears and very high buy-to-let arrears. Most SMEs with distressed
loans have a workout plan that will trigger a debt restructure when the SME completes steps
such as property disposals, yet this process could take some years. Although SMEs may have
access to working capital in the interim, their capacity to invest and create jobs is constrained.
30.
Reducing nonperforming loans remains important to address private debt
overhangs and to enhance medium-term prospects for bank lending. In the immediate
future Irish bank lending can pick up despite high NPLs given attractive lending margins, ready
access to funding, and adequate capital and provisions. It may also be the case that NPL
resolution adds little to bank profitability in the near-term, as durable restructures may not
significantly increase debt service payments and proceeds from disposals of loans or collateral
would initially add to low yielding liquidity. For borrowers, however, resolution would address
debt overhangs that constrain their economic activity and limit their mobility, in time supporting
broader economic activity. Moreover, as demand for credit grows, banks will need to be able to
shift credit skills from NPL management to loan origination, especially as margins and funding
conditions may not remain so favorable. In the medium-term, banks’ capacity to originate loans
would also benefit from the ability to redeploy capital and funding permitted by NPL resolution.
31.
The authorities should therefore reinvigorate efforts to tackle entrenched NPLs. The
momentum built under the MART framework should be maintained, with banking supervision
continuing to monitor and guide banks’ mortgage resolution efforts carefully. Maintaining a high
level of transparency on the scale and quality of resolution would support progress. But the
problems of prolonged arrears do not appear to be effectively addressed by the current
framework. The authorities should take steps to hasten durable resolution in these cases,
including through timely proceedings for repossession to secure the engagement of borrowers
on lasting restructures where feasible. Further efforts to raise the utilization of the personal
insolvency system, including bankruptcy proceedings, are also needed to motivate timely
resolution. On the SME side, supervision should ensure that banks are proactive in advancing the
completion of workouts, especially as market conditions for property disposal improve.
32.
Supervision should encourage early actions to address bank capital quality issues,
which would also safeguard banks’ lending capacity. Deferred tax assets and preference
shares are set to be phased out as eligible regulatory capital under the new EU rules. Early steps
by banks to restructure their capital base and build high quality loss absorbing capital before the
new capital rules become binding is preferable to relying primarily on the internal capital
generation that is emerging across the sector.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

17

IRELAND

33.
Further development of nonbank financing, especially for SMEs, can complement
bank lending and contain macro-financial risks. Appropriately regulated, nonbank financing
can diversify sources of funding for the economy and reduce overall leverage helping to make
borrowers and banks more resilient to shocks such as property cycles (see Chapter 2 of the
Selected Issues Paper). Real estate investment trusts (REITs), authorized since 2013, have leverage
limited to 50 percent of the market value of their assets. They are bringing in fresh equity into
real estate markets, providing a significant layer of protection for lenders, and moderating
macro-financial risks compared with real estate activity financed primarily with bank lending. The
scope to facilitate the provision of risk capital to SMEs should also be explored, where the legal
and regulatory environment for different modalities of non-bank financing should be assessed,
such as closed-end mutual funds, private equity, and SME securitizations and covered bonds.
34.
State sponsored financing vehicles can play a supportive role but fiscal risks should
continue to be contained. Legislation for the Irish Strategic Investment Fund (ISIF) was enacted
in July 2014. With some 4 percent of GDP in resources, it has the capacity to support economic
activity and employment through commercial investments in Ireland. Two of the ISIF’s SME Funds
have demonstrated solid deal flow since incorporation while the third will not be renewed as
improving conditions have limited opportunities for SME turnaround funding. This
responsiveness to evolving market conditions is welcome and the ISIF should continue to be
carefully managed given its recent entry into a venture capital role. The Strategic Banking
Corporation of Ireland (SBCI) could enhance credit availability for SMEs and help ease lending
rates, yet monitoring of loan portfolio risks is needed given state funding guarantees.
35.
Authorities’ views. The authorities noted that substantial legislative, administrative, and
supervisory efforts had been undertaken in recent years to facilitate resolution of distressed loans,
and that the progress made is greater than evident from solely focusing on headline NPL ratios.
The resolution process would need to continue for a number of years, which they considered
appropriate while employment and property markets were still recovering. Building on the progress
achieved through the imposition of MART in 2013–14, they would continue to monitor resolution
progress and take appropriate measures as needed. On the quality of bank capital, the authorities
are confident that banks’ medium term capital management plans will fully meet the new
regulatory requirements. Regarding SME financing, they favored further developing alternatives to
bank lending, and would continue to carefully manage the risks associated with ISIF and SBCI.
Promoting Resilience and Tempering Cycles
36.
While financial and property cycles will continue, the durability of Ireland’s
recovery should be protected by policies to promote resilience and temper cycles. The CBI
recently published A Macro-Prudential Policy Framework for Ireland, which sets out the range of
instruments at its disposal and its decision making process for the application of those tools. This
framework should be applied proactively as macro-financial risks evolve. Nonetheless, there are
significant uncertainties around the appropriate timing and impact of adjustments in macroprudential instruments, making it important to take steps ex ante to maintain financial resilience
through the cycle.
18

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

IRELAND

37.
Recent CBI steps to strengthen the regulation of residential mortgage lending are
therefore very welcome. The CBI has announced that (i) no more than 15 percent of mortgage
lending to owner-occupiers will be at a loan to value (LTV) ratio of greater than 80 percent, and;
(ii) no more than 20 percent of mortgage lending will be at a loan to income (LTI) ratio of greater
than 3.5 times. In the case of first-time buyers, the LTV limit is 90 percent up to a property value
of €220,000 and 80 percent on amounts above that. Such differential treatment is warranted as
first-time buyers have shown a lower default rate (Box 3), but it should be kept under review
based on default experience. Together the LTV and LTI limits will increase the resilience of
borrowers and banks to shocks, and may help dampen the property cycle, as the past boom was
facilitated by a sharp rise in LTI ratios as well as high LTV ratios. Close supervisory monitoring of
compliance with the new rules is essential. The credit register will eventually provide valuable
information on borrowers’ credit records and total debt, helping to limit circumvention.
38.
Bank resilience to commercial real estate risks must be protected, especially given
the international search for yield. Losses on commercial property accounted for over half of
bank capital needs in the crisis. The current upwards pressure on commercial property prices may
continue for some time given the low yields available on many assets and the ECB’s quantitative
easing, raising the eventual prospect of a renewed price slump. Supervision should therefore
focus closely on banks’ risk management, underwriting standards, and valuations in this sector.
Deployment of macro-prudential tools to contain bank’s commercial property exposures, such as
loan-to-value limits and capital add-ons, should be biased to being ahead of the curve, especially
given the availability of nonbank and international financing sources for this sector.
39.
Addressing the weakness in housing construction will help dampen price increases
over time. While house price rises are beginning to promote a construction supply response, it
has been weaker than in past experience. High construction costs are a key factor, including local
House Completions and the House Price-to-Cost Ratio

A more developed rental market would support labor mobility, help moderate
property cycles, and reduce household exposure to house price fluctuations. Rented
properties are a low share of Irish housing. Although Ireland rates favorably on indicators such as
rent control, indicators related to landlord-tenant relationships suggest room for improvement.

Box 3. Mortgage Regulation and First Time Buyers
The CBI recently established a new regulation on residential mortgage lending. The primary objective
of the regulation is to increase the resilience of the banking and household sectors to financial shocks and,
as a secondary objective, to dampen pro-cyclical dynamics between property lending and housing prices.
The regulation puts caps on loan to value (LTV) and loan to income (LTI) ratios, as summarized in the table.
The caps are “proportionate” with a small share of gross lending allowed to breach the caps, as in New
Zealand.
The calibration of the caps was guided by international norms and judgment, and also reflected the
public consultation process. Analysis of loan level data shows a rise in loan losses at higher LTV and LTI
ratios, and also supports tighter regulation of buy-to-let loans. In the near-term, the LTV cap is more likely to
be binding, as LTVs exceeded 80 percent on 40 percent of primary dwelling mortgages in 2013—over the
15 percent that may exceed an 80 percent LTV—while LTIs exceeded 3.5 on 20 percent of mortgage loans.
Indeed, the main issue arising from the CBI’s consultation on the proposed regulation was the impact of the
80 percent LTV cap, especially on first time buyers (FTBs) who accounted for almost half of new mortgages
in 2014.

difference of 30 percent, implying that FTBs are
nearly 4 percentage points less likely to default
than SSBs. For the average FTB, an increase in LTV
from 80 percent to 90 percent is estimated to
increase the probability of default by just over 1
percentage point. This result supports a higher LTV
cap for FTBs while ensuring default risk comparable

to the remainder of mortgage lending. Nonetheless, the sample for the analysis is dominated by mortgages
originated during a boom with weak underwriting standards, making it appropriate to periodically review
FTB default experience in future and adjust the regulation if needed to protect the financial resilience of FTB
borrowers.

For example, the large role of small scale
buy-to-let investors in providing rental
housing militates against security of tenure
for renters, as this undermines the liquidity of
the investors’ property. The framework for
rental property should be reviewed with the
aim of attracting professional investment and
management into the sector, which could in
time expand the supply and quality of rental
property and moderate rents.

Authorities’ views. The authorities agreed on the need to promote the financial resilience of
borrowers and banks through the cycle, while noting that the new mortgage regulations could be
adjusted to moderate risks if the need arose. The authorities are monitoring commercial real estate
market developments, but they did not consider a similar rules-based regulation appropriate given the
scale and idiosyncratic nature of these transactions, and would instead utilize onsite and offsite
examination of credit underwriting and supervisory powers such as the application of individual capital
add-ons. On housing supply, the authorities emphasized that they were proactive in this area. The
Construction 2020 strategy addresses key issues related to planning, sustainable development financing,
and transparent and sustainable mortgage lending. Legislation on planning will be submitted to
parliament before the summer recess, a conference to bring equity providers and developers together has
been organized, and a public consultation has been launched on taxation measures to encourage
development of zoned and serviced land. Expanded investment in Budget 2015 and the recently launched
Social Housing Strategy aim to address the undersupply of affordable and good quality social housing.

STAFF APPRAISAL
42.
Ireland’s recovery is off to a good start and the priority is to maintain solid growth
and job creation. Export and investment driven growth is beginning to be supported by
consumption. Ireland has the potential for a self-sustaining recovery to reduce high
unemployment, which will entail rising investment with growing needs for financing. Yet risks to
growth widen in the medium term, including from the potential for protracted slow growth in the
euro area. A combination of prudent fiscal and financial policies is needed to support growth
while building policy space and private sector resilience to help manage shocks.
43.
Ireland should seek to balance its budget over the cycle through a phased and
steady adjustment. By ensuring that growth erodes Ireland’s high public debt burden over time,
fiscal balance will underpin confidence to invest and create jobs, even in less favorable economic
and financial conditions. Declining debt will also rebuild the fiscal space needed to allow Ireland
to cushion future shocks to growth. Closing the structural deficit over a three year period, at a
pace of no less than ½ percent of GDP annually, would limit the drag on growth in the near-term
and support economic stability. EU fiscal rules will support such a path toward fiscal balance but
Irish-specific technical issues in applying these rules should be addressed.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

21

IRELAND

44.
The policy mix to achieve steady fiscal adjustment should protect Ireland’s growth
potential and not exclude revenue measures. Public investment has been reduced to low
levels and the amount and quality of spending should be reviewed carefully to ensure adequate
maintenance and avoid growth bottlenecks. Both the expenditure and revenue sides can support
adjustment and help create room to rebuild capital spending over time. Revenue measures could
also be needed if evolving international tax standards impact the tax base in the medium term.
Reforms are needed to deliver core public services within a manageable spending envelop in the
face of demographic pressures, including continued wage restraint after current agreements
expire, better targeting social protection spending, improving the cost efficiency of healthcare
provision, and reforming higher education funding while protecting low income students.
45.
A range of policy efforts are needed to facilitate a lasting revival of financing flows
in support of investment and recovery. Although significant progress has been made with
resolving nonperforming loans in recent years, cases of prolonged arrears are rising and
buy-to-let arrears remain very high. Reinvigorated efforts are needed to hasten resolution of the
most entrenched cases to address private debt overhangs and enhance medium-term prospects
for bank lending. Supervision should also encourage banks to take early actions to address
capital quality issues to safeguard their lending capacity. Scope to further develop nonbank
financing should be explored, especially risk capital for SMEs, to complement bank lending and
moderate macro-financial risks. Fiscal risks from state financing vehicles should be contained.
46.
It is timely to strengthen the financial resilience of banks and borrowers to ensure
recovery is more robust to future shocks including property cycles. Macro-prudential policy
tools should be applied proactively as risks evolve, yet, given uncertainties around the impact of
these tools, policies must also ensure financial resilience through the cycle. The CBI’s recent steps
to strengthen the regulation of residential mortgage lending are therefore welcome. The
differential treatment of first-time borrowers should be kept under review based on default
experience. With commercial property prices rising fast, in part due to international inflows in
search of yield, supervision should ensure bank exposures to these risks are appropriately
contained, with the deployment of macro-prudential tools biased to being ahead of the curve.
47.
Construction and rental market reforms could dampen increases in prices and rents,
and in time temper Ireland’s property cycles and associated macroeconomic instability. The
construction supply response should be strengthened through initiatives to reduce construction
costs and enhance incentives to complete developments. A streamlining of planning procedures,
together with the implementation of other Construction 2020 actions, would also improve the
performance of this sector. The rental property framework should be reformed with the aim of
attracting investment and professional management to expand the supply and quality of rental
property. Over time this would moderate rents, benefitting those on low incomes in particular,
while also facilitating labor mobility in support of sustained growth and low unemployment.
48.
It is recommended to hold the next Article IV consultation with Ireland on the
standard 12-month cycle.

Annex I. External Balance and Competitiveness Assessment
A range of External Balance Assessment methodologies suggest that the external position is broadly
in line with fundamentals and desirable policy settings. Setting aside the slump associated with the
pharmaceutical “patent cliff”, Ireland’s competitiveness has held up well in recent years. Ireland is a
booming hub for service industries, non-pharmaceutical goods exports have managed to reclaim
some market share since 2012, and solid FDI inflows serve as proof of investors’ continued
favorable assessment of the country’s business-friendly environment.

A.

External Balance broadly in Equilibrium

Current Account and Exchange Rates
External Balance Assessment methodologies indicate that the external position is broadly
in line with fundamentals and desirable policy settings. The real exchange rate has fallen
notably since the crisis—especially when

– the REER was 5½ percent lower in January 2015 compared to the 2014 average. In both cases,
policy gaps make a negligible contribution to the overall CA and REER gaps.

Note: A positive CA gap indicates undervaluation, a positive REER gap indicated overvaluatio n.
Estimates are based on data available in October 2014.

Redomiciled firms may explain the bulk of the estimated positive current account gap. The
apparent contradiction between the CA- and REER-based approaches can be reconciled by the
proliferation of “redomiciled firms”, enterprises which only establish their headquarters in Ireland
to consolidate their profits for taxation at the Irish corporate rate. FitzGerald (2013) estimates
that retained earnings contributed 5.3 percent of GDP to the current account balance in 2012.

Updated CSO data put the contribution at 3.9 percent of GDP for 2013 and at least as much in
2014, which represents two-thirds of the estimated current account gap.
Capital Account Flows and International Investment Position
Ireland’s capital account is dominated by the International Financial Services Center (IFSC).
It accounts for 85 percent of overall portfolio and other investment flows and its total
transactions are 33 times larger than Ireland’s GDP. However, IFSC inflows and outflows are
closely matched, as it serves as a hub for international financial transactions. As a result the IFSC’s
IIP is very close to balance, with the overall NIIP dominated by the non-IFSC sector. In this
respect, it should be noted that although Ireland is a large FDI recipient, its net direct investment
position is in fact positive. This is due in part to large positive valuation effects associated with
redomiciled firms’ foreign assets.

Competitiveness—Services up, Pharmaceuticals down

Ireland’s strong export performance has been driven primarily by the services sector.
Exports of goods rose relative to GDP in 2010-11, but have since receded somewhat in relative
importance. On the other hand, exports of services have steadily increased, and have surpassed
goods exports in 2013. This has also translated into a rapidly increasing share in world services
exports, while goods exports have fallen notably in relation to international goods trade, from
1.4 percent of world exports in 2002 to under 0.7 percent by 2012–14.

The assessment of developments in goods exports is complicated by “contract
manufacturing” in the pharmaceutical sector. Goods exports as recorded at the customs
increased 1.5 percent y/y in euro terms in the first ten months of 2014, even as national accounts
report real goods export growth of 15 percent y/y for the first nine months of the year. This
discrepancy can be traced in part to the

2014, but pharmaceutical exports accounted at
customs have dropped 3.6 percent over the same period.1 The growing importance of contracted
manufacturing since early 2014 may pose issues down the road in interpreting results of various
methods for assessing the external balance and competitiveness.

To extend cross-country comparability to 2014, pharmaceutical exports are measured by adding values for
Harmonized System lines 29 (Organic Chemicals) and 30 (Pharmaceutical products). This is a somewhat narrower
definition than used in the Ministry of Finance study of the pharmaceutical patent cliff (SITC codes 51 and 54).

The impact of the pharmaceutical patent cliff conceals a possible emerging revival of
goods exports in other sectors. Ireland has been steadily losing ground on world markets
(figure 6, left panel). This drop cannot be attributed in full to the rise of emerging markets, as
Ireland’s share in EU exports has been decreasing along the same path, i.e. it lost ground within
the EU. However, much of this decrease is due to the patent cliff in the pharmaceutical sector
(middle panel), with the rest of the exports (right panel) registering a tepid recovery of market
share—both in world and EU exports—2012. At the same time, there are early signs that the
impact of the pharmaceutical patent cliff is gradually dissipating.

International Tourism Competitiveness

While IT and business services represents nearly two-thirds of services exports, these are in part
driven by multinationals global operations, which have relatively little domestic value-added and
cloud to some extent the underlying competitiveness of the Irish economy. That is why
evaluating the performance of an export-oriented services industry with higher domestic value
added is useful to gauge the economy’s overall competitiveness in the services sector.
International tourism is a fitting candidate – it accounts for sizeable shares both in GDP
(2 percent) and services exports (4 percent), and cross country comparisons are possible in both
nominal (tourism receipts) and real terms (arrivals or night-stays).

Ireland lost global market share in the aftermath of the crisis. Indirect evidence suggests that this
may be in part due to the fact that tourism figures are affected by temporary migrant workers
(and relatives visiting them) who have left in the wake of the economic crisis. For example,
arrivals from Poland have seen the largest drop among top origin countries between 2007 and
2009: 28 percent vs. an average of 13 percent for other OECD countries. Since 2009, Ireland’s
share in arrivals has declined only marginally, while the share of tourism receipts have flattened
(world) or even improved (compared to other EU destinations).
While looking at market share trends is useful to gauge developments in a country’s
competitiveness, one could also ask how attractive of a tourism destination Ireland is in absolute
terms. Ideally, this should be done after accounting for a range of objective factors (size, distance
to markets, historical and linguistic ties, etc.). One approach for answering this question com es
from the gravity model, which has gained widespread use in the goods trade literature. Culiuc
(2014) applies the gravity model to a large cross-country dataset covering the universe of
bilateral tourism arrivals between 1999 and 2009, and estimates the impact on tourism of a rich
set of gravity variables (economic, geographical, cultural, linguistic, etc.).2 Estimated coefficients

on country dummies from country fixed effects regressions can serve as an index of tourism
attractiveness after accounting for all these factors. When estimated for intra-OECD tourism
arrivals, the model suggests that Ireland was – over the 1999-2009 period – marginally above
average on this particular indicator of tourism competitiveness.

Finally, the same framework can be used to estimate on which markets Ireland is doing better or
worse than the model predicts, effectively measuring the relative market performance. Results for
OECD markets are presented in the figure below. Ireland has been gradually losing its stronghold
in traditional Anglophone markets – primarily the UK and the US, but also Canada, Australia and
New Zealand – while labor migration is the likely driver behind the large over-performance for
Poland.

Annex II. Debt Sustainability Analysis
This Annex presents the public and external debt sustainability analysis (DSA) based on staff’s
medium-term macroeconomic framework and the Irish authorities’ fiscal projections.
Public Debt Sustainability Analysis
1.
Statistical accounting revisions and one-off events had a significant impact on the
historical debt-to-GDP data in 2014. The key change in historical debt data arises from the
consolidation of the Irish Bank Resolution Corporation (IBRC) into general government with the
shift to ESA 2010, which added €12.6 billion to end-2013 public debt, a 6.2 percent increase.
However, the transition to ESA 2010 also resulted in an upward revision to GDP of 6.5 percent in
2013. As a result, the revised debt-to-GDP ratio of 123.3 percent at end 2013 is very close to the
123.7 percent reported to the 1st PPM Report. However, gross public debt is estimated to have
dropped 12 percentage points, to 111 percent of GDP at end-2014 on account of two main
factors:


The liquidation of IBRC has been mostly completed in 2014 on the back of strong investor
interest, with remaining liabilities down to €1.5 billion (expected to be dealt with gradually in
coming years). This liquidation lowers end-2014 debt by 6 percentage points of GDP.



The draw-down of cash deposits and short-term investments from €18.5 to €11 billion over the
course of the year contributed a 4 percentage point drop in the gross debt-to-GDP ratio. This
reduction in the cash buffers built ahead of exiting the EU-IMF supported program was
enabled by an improved outlook and favorable financing conditions.

2.
The baseline debt outlook has
improved since the DSA in the past year. Gross
public debt is 4 percentage points lower in 2014
after accounting for statistical revisions, and is
forecast to remain below the medium-term debt
path from the 1st PPM report owing to:




Better growth prospects. Growth revisions for
2014-15 alone reduce the end-2015 debt
ratio by 3.3 percentage points of GDP.

Early repayments. Early repayments of Fund credit—which began in mid-December 2014—
improve debt sustainability by lowering the interest bill by a cumulative total of 1 percent of
GDP over a number of years and is also expected to extend the debt maturity profile.
Although projected gross financing needs (GFN) for 2015 are raised by financing IMF these
repayments, GFN is forecast to remain below 15 percent of GDP over the medium term,
mitigating the risks associated with the debt level.

Improved financing conditions. The yield on 10 year Irish bonds is around 1.2 percent, with
both the reference German bund rate and spreads lower than previously anticipated. The
ECB’s quantitative easing program lowers risks that these favorable conditions will see a
sudden reversal in coming years. Nonetheless, the baseline is built on conservative
projections, which do not take into account the full extent of recent declines in spreads.3



3.
A heat map and fan charts indicate that Ireland faces high risks to debt
sustainability (Figure 1). The debt burden benchmark for advanced economies of 85 percent of
GDP is exceeded, indicating that Ireland’s debt level is highly vulnerable under all scenarios
regardless of the extent to which a shock increases debt. GFN exceeds 15 percent of GDP under
the contingent liability shock but remains below the vulnerability threshold of 20 percent of GDP.
The debt profile is also subject to high risks from external financing requirements (excluding
debts of the IFSC) and public debt held by non-residents which exceed the upper risk assessment
benchmarks for these indicators.4 The fan charts illustrate the possible evolution of the debt-toGDP ratio over the medium term, based on both a symmetric and an asymmetric distribution of
risks. The asymmetric fan chart (where only negative shocks to the primary balance are
considered) is more relevant given the remaining fiscal adjustment and shows that risks to the
debt outlook are skewed to the upside.
4.
There is no evidence of a systematic projection bias in the baseline assumptions for
key macroeconomic variables (Figure 2). The median forecast errors for real GDP growth and
the primary balance during 2005–13 are below 1 percent and in line with other countries.
Individual large forecast errors for growth, primary balance, and inflation mostly arise during the
crisis period, especially for the primary balance where there were very large unforeseen bank
recapitalization costs.
5.
Reflecting the sizable fiscal effort, Ireland’s fiscal adjustment is projected to
improve its primary balance to above its debt stabilizing threshold (Figure 2). The projected
change in the cyclically-adjusted primary balance is in the top quartile of fiscal adjustments
observed in advanced and emerging market countries with debt greater than 60 percent of GDP.
While sizable, this projected adjustment is consistent with Ireland’s track record of steadfast
efforts during its EU-IMF supported program, and is further underpinned by Ireland’s
commitments under the EDP and fiscal rules entrenched in the Fiscal Responsibility Act.
6.
Under the baseline macroeconomic projection, Ireland’s debt ratio will continue
declining (Figures 3 and 4). After a significant boost from automatic debt dynamics in 2014,
when low interest rates and high growth reduced debt by 1.9 percentage points of GDP, it is
projected that the interest rate-growth differential will remain close to zero in the medium term.
GFN are forecasted to follow a U-shape and peak at 13 percent of GDP in 2020 before dropping
in subsequent years.
3

While incoporating easier financing conditions in the Eurozone, the projections keeps spreads on Irish bonds at
125 bps for 2015 (currently below 90 bps), gradually increasing to 200 bps by 2018.
4

Note that Irish government bonds held by non-residents are considered to be external debt for this analysis.

7.
The projected decline in public debt remains vulnerable to lower growth (Figure 5).
Key risks include:


Growth shock. If projected real GDP growth rates for 2015–16 are lowered by 0.5 standard
deviations (implying annual growth about 2 percentage points lower at 1 percent in 2016
and 0.7 percent in 2017), the debt-to-GDP ratio peaks at 112 percent in 2017 (compared with
104 percent under the baseline) before declining.5



Interest rate shock. In the medium term, Ireland is shielded from a rise in interest rates by its
still-high share of fixed rate and official borrowing and by relatively low financing needs in
coming years. For example, a 200 basis point interest rate increase on new borrowing affects
the debt trajectory only marginally.6



Macro-fiscal shock. If slower growth in 2016–17 were compounded by a primary balance
shock7 and by an increase in interest rates on new borrowing by 2 percentage points, the
debt ratio rises to 113 percent of GDP in 2017 and falls to 103 percent by 2020. In this
scenario, gross financing needs increase by 2.1 percentage points of GDP on average over
the medium term, reaching 15 percent in 2020.



Contingent liability shock. With the recent completion of the 2014 Comprehensive
Assessment and expected completion of IBRC liquidation without budgetary costs,
remaining sources of financial sector contingent liabilities include: (i) risks that bank
provisions are inadequate to cover losses on their large NPLs, although such risks are
currently contained by conservative assumptions on collateral valuation; (ii) shortfalls in the
crystallized value of NAMA assets, although NAMA management is confident of at least
breaking even given the improvement in market conditions; and (iii) costs related to the
restructuring of the credit union sector, although these are contained by the size of the
sector, with net loans being only 2½ percent of GDP. Without estimates of the potential
realization of these contingencies, a scenario assuming a 10 percent of GDP shock is used.8
Such a shock, if combined with the above growth shock, would push gross public debt to
around 117 percent of GDP in 2016-17 before declining to 106 percent by 2020.

5

A one-half standard deviation shock, instead of a default one standard deviation shock, is applied to the growth
rate to adjust for the exceptionally volatile growth rates during the recent boom-bust years.
6

A 200 basis point interest rate shock, instead of a larger shock derived from the difference between average real
interest rate level over the projection period and maximum real historical level (equivalent to 541 basis points),
appears more appropriate given the exceptionally high interest rates during the crisis years (2008–10).
7

A shock equivalent to the full size of the planned fiscal adjustment over the medium term is used, which worsens
primary balances by an average of 1.1 percentage points of GDP. A larger temporary shock derived from baseline
primary balance minus one-half of the 10-year historical standard deviation is not yet appropriate, given the
exceptionally high primary deficits (reflecting bank recap costs) during the crisis years.
8

A 10 percent of GDP shock is used, instead of a default shock of 10 percent of banking sector assets (equivalent
to around 30 percent of GDP), taking into account the 40 percent of GDP of public support to the financial sector
already incurred.

8.
Debt reductions from asset sales present an upside risk. Current baseline assumptions
do not incorporate proceeds from any further state asset disposals of stakes in the banks.
Similarly, no allowance is made for further transactions reducing the cost incurred in supporting
the banking system beyond the sales of interests in BoI and Irish Life in 2013.9 For example, the
NTMA valued state holdings in AIB at €13.3 billion (about 7 percent of GDP) at end 2014.
External debt sustainability analysis
9.
The external debt of the non-IFSC sector continues to decline, though it remains
very high.10 At the end of Q3 2014, it fell to around 254 percent of GDP, from 320 percent of
GDP recorded in 2010. This gross debt figure includes debt of large multinational corporations,
including both intra-company and intra-group

program were disbursed in late 2013/early
2014. External debt is expected to continue falling, but this is subject to some risks, as all shock
scenarios would suggest more gradual reductions in public debt. Including the IFSC, total
external debt remains very high at 910 percent of GDP, although IFSC debt has declined
considerably in recent years (down 23 percentage points of GDP since early 2012).

9

The public sector stakes are 99.9 percent in AIB, 15.2 percent in BoI, and 99.02 for PTSB.

10

The discussion focuses on the non-IFSC sector, as the IFSC principally serves nonresidents.

STATISTICAL ISSUES
A. Assessment of Data Adequacy for Surveillance
General: Data provision is broadly adequate for surveillance.
National accounts and real sector data. Quarterly national accounts are currently published
within three months of its reference period. Other real sector data are relatively timely, with
industrial production and retail sales data published within six weeks and employment data
within 3 months of the reference period, but some non-SDDS series are published one and a half
years later (e.g., household disposable income). Employment and unit labor costs, and national
income and expenditure data are usually available with a three-month lag.
Wages and earnings statistics. The quarterly Earnings, Hours and Employment Costs Survey has
replaced the four-yearly Labor Cost Survey, and also replaces all other existing short-term
earnings surveys. The results are comparable across sectors and include more detail on
components of earnings and labor costs than was available before. However, data are only
available with more than six months lag.
Government finance statistics. The authorities publish Exchequer returns on a monthly and
quarterly basis, but only annual data are available for general government finances. The
authorities are working to strengthen the analytical content of exchequer reporting and
enhancing reporting and forecasting for the general government. However, annual and quarterly
general government statistics on an accrual basis are available as derived from the national
accounts statistics. Ireland reports these data to STA through a conversion of the datasets
reported to Eurostat under the “ESA Transmission Programme”.
Monetary and financial statistics: The ECB reporting framework is used for monetary statistics
and data are reported to the IMF through a “gateway” arrangement with the ECB. The
arrangement provides an efficient transmission of monetary statistics to the IMF and for
publication in the IMF’s International Financial Statistics (IFS).
Financial sector surveillance: Ireland reports FSIs for deposit takers, other financial
corporations, and real estate markets on a regular basis for posting on the IMF’s FSI website.
External sector statistics. Quarterly balance of payments (BOP) and international investment
position (IIP) data are compiled by the Central Statistics Office. The authorities implemented the
sixth edition of the Balance of Payments and International Investment Position Manual (BPM6)
beginning with the data for Q1 2014, although those data have not been reported to STA as of
February 2015. The most recent BOP and IIP data reported to STA and disseminated in the IFS
are for Q4/2013. Ireland reports data for the Coordinated Portfolio Investment Survey (CPIS), the
Coordinated Direct Investment Survey (CDIS), and the Data Template on International Reserves
and Foreign Currency Liquidity.

B. Data Standards and Quality
Ireland is subject to the statistical requirements
and timeliness and reporting standards of
Eurostat and the European Central Bank (ECB).
Ireland subscribes to the Fund’s Special Data
Dissemination Standard and uses SDDS
flexibility options on the timeliness of wages
and earnings, and central government debt
data.

No data ROSC is available.

INFORMATION
Prepared By

European Department

This supplement provides information that has become available since the issuance of
the staff report on March 10, 2015. The information does not alter the thrust of the
staff appraisal.
National accounts data for Q4 confirm
the strong growth in 2014. Preliminary
data for GDP in 2014 indicate growth of
4.8 percent y/y, consistent with staff
projections. Final domestic demand and
net exports made similar contributions to
growth, of just over 2 percentage points.
With net factor income payments to
nonresidents rising by 2.7 percent, Gross
National Product recorded a 5.2 percent
increase on the year.

The Central Statistical Office (CSO) also released a notice in relation to contract
manufacturing, a topic discussed in Box 1 of the staff report. The CSO concludes
that additional products made under contract manufacturing arrangements for Irish
companies were not particularly significant in explaining Irish GDP growth in 2014. The
information released does not permit a precise calculation of the contribution to
growth in 2014 from contract manufacturing, but suggests that the upper estimate
provided in the staff report, of a contribution of perhaps as much as 2 percentage
points, is likely too high.
Strong tax revenues narrowed the budget deficit in early 2015. Tax revenues rose
by 16 percent y/y in the first two months of 2015, exceeding the monthly profile by
5.4 percent. Revenue gains were broad-based, with strong increases in VAT and excises
supported by buoyant post-Christmas retail trading, while solid rises in personal
income taxes and social contributions back up signs of ongoing recovery in the labor

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

International Monetary Fund

Washington, D. C. 20431 USA

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2015 Article IV Consultation with Ireland
On March 23, 2015, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded
the 2015 Article IV consultation with Ireland.1
Ireland enjoyed strong growth in 2014, at about 5 percent y/y, led by exports and investment.
Solid job creation has brought the unemployment rate down to 10½ percent, from a peak of 15
percent three years ago. These positive economic developments drove higher than expected
growth in revenues, helping bring the fiscal deficit down to an estimated 3.9 percent of GDP in
2014 despite some spending overruns.
Property markets are bouncing back rapidly, with commercial real estate values up 30.7 percent
y/y in 2014, boosted in part by international investment. House prices rose 16.3 percent y/y, as
fast as in the boom, helping to improve private balance sheet health. Yet some 14.8 percent of
primary dwelling mortgages remain in arrears, with the majority having been in arrears for over
two years. Overall nonperforming loans still amount to about one-quarter of total bank loans.
Looking to 2015, Ireland’s growth is expected to remain robust, at about 3½ percent, bolstered by the
ECB’s quantitative easing. Consumption is beginning to support activity, aided by the impact of
falling energy prices on real incomes. Bank credit has declined for a number of years, yet rising
mortgage approvals, together with banks’ improving profitability and ready access to low cost
funding, suggest the decline will slow in 2015. The budget is on track for a deficit of 2.7 percent of
GDP in 2015, which would enable Ireland to exit the EU’s Excessive Deficit Procedure.
Executive Board Assessment2
Executive Directors welcomed Ireland’s strong economic recovery, the further decline in
unemployment, and the strengthened fiscal balances. They noted that medium-term growth

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with members, usually every
year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial information, and discusses with officials the country's
economic developments and policies. On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for

prospects appear favorable, though facing headwinds from risks of protracted slow growth in
advanced economies, especially the euro area. Directors agreed that the priority is to maintain
solid growth, which would require continued prudence in fiscal and financial policies to build
policy space, while addressing legacy issues in the banking and housing sectors.
Directors commended the authorities for their steadfast consolidation efforts to reduce the fiscal
deficit and public debt ratios. Going forward, they endorsed the goal of balancing the structural
budget over the cycle through a phased and steady adjustment, allowing a continued build-up of
the fiscal space while supporting the recovery in the near term. This calls for a careful calibration
of revenue and expenditure measures. Given the need to create room for essential capital
expenditure, Directors encouraged efforts to further broaden the tax base, contain the public
wage bill, and improve the targeting of social programs. They also saw merit in saving windfall
revenue for debt reduction and in reviewing public investment to ensure its adequacy and high
quality in support of potential growth. Directors supported expenditure reforms to deliver public
services within a manageable envelope in light of demographic pressures.
Directors recognized the significant progress made in reducing nonperforming loans in recent
years. They recommended that the authorities take further decisive steps to resolve cases of
prolonged arrears in order to address private debt overhangs and promote credit flows to the
economy. Greater utilization of insolvency procedures would be helpful in this regard. Directors
also considered it important that banks take early actions to address capital quality issues ahead
of new rules on eligible regulatory capital becoming effective, thereby safeguarding their lending
capacity. Directors supported exploring nonbank financing options, with appropriate supervision
and regulation put in place, while remaining vigilant to fiscal risks from state-sponsored
financing vehicles.
Directors stressed that sustaining a robust recovery calls for measures to further enhance the
resilience of banks and borrowers to shocks, including property cycles. They welcomed recent
steps to strengthen the regulation of residential mortgage lending. Noting the rapid rise in
commercial property prices, Directors encouraged close supervision, supported by proactive use
of macro-prudential tools, to ensure that bank risk exposures are appropriately contained.
Directors highlighted the medium-term benefits of reforms of the construction sector and
residential rental markets in moderating Ireland’s property cycles. They looked forward to the
timely implementation of the initiatives set out in Construction 2020, particularly a
modernization and streamlining of planning procedures. Directors also supported reforms of the
rental property framework to attract investment and professional management to the sector,
which, by enhancing the supply and quality of rental property, would facilitate labor mobility
and lower unemployment.
