EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
•

Recent economic developments in Botswana have been positive. Growth has picked
up, especially in the non-mineral economy. Inflation has fallen substantially, stabilizing
near the top of the Bank of Botswana (BoB) target range, though inflation risks remain.
Continued high mineral prices are contributing to healthy fiscal and balance of payments
surpluses. Though the incidence of poverty, unemployment, and HIV/AIDS remain high,
all have declined recently.

•

The economy is slowly diversifying but the expected sharp decline in diamond
production after 2020 poses a challenge. Continued and prospective development of
minerals and large-scale investment in electricity generation are projected to support
fiscal and balance of payments surpluses through 2011, but more rapid diversification
away from diamonds is needed to support growth and generate employment.

•

Maintaining fiscal surpluses over the medium term is essential to sustain budgetary
spending when diamond revenues decline. Although the authorities have met their
fiscal goal of keeping public expenditures below 40 percent of GDP, the next National
Development Plan (NDP 10) should have more ambitious goals for maintaining fiscal
savings and boosting non-mineral revenues.

•

The creation of an explicit sovereign wealth fund could strengthen support for fiscal
savings by underscoring the link between fiscal surpluses now and more stable spending
in the future when diamond revenues decline, and also the need to channel the bulk of
returns on public financial assets back to government.

•

Striking an appropriate balance between monetary and exchange rate policy
objectives is critical. Devaluation provided a competitive boost to exports, but the rapid
expansion in BoB certificates (BoBCs) to absorb excess liquidity is imposing a high
interest cost on the bank. Further reduction in the rate of crawl, consistent with inflation
differentials, would facilitate further interest rate reductions. The real effective exchange
rate has stabilized in the past year at close to its equilibrium value.

•

The banking sector is sound and near-term risks are well contained, but the agenda
for financial sector reform is still sizable. The authorities should build on the Financial
Sector Assessment Program (FSAP) to formulate a reform plan that would substantially
strengthen supervision of nonbank financial institutions (NBFIs).

•

Structural reforms are needed to raise productivity. The privatization agenda has
slowed, but large parastatals should still be privatized, with appropriate regulation. The
skills mismatch should be addressed by reforming education and vocational training.
Recent government initiatives on foreign investment and competition policy need to be
completed. Liberalizing administered prices would improve efficiency. Better statistics
would enhance policy analysis.

5
I. OVERVIEW
1.
Sound macroeconomic policies, good governance, and high levels of investment,
supported by diamond and other mineral production, have moved Botswana well into
the ranks of middle-income countries (Figure 1). Real GDP growth has averaged
4½ percent for the past four years, a solid performance, but below the expectations of the
National Development Plan 9 (NDP 9), which ends with fiscal year 2008/09. Inflation has
fallen near the average for the South African rand area and balance of payments and fiscal
surpluses have built reserves and reduced Botswana’s already low external debt.
2.
Despite impressive progress in raising living standards, more needs to be done.
Although the incidence of HIV/AIDS has begun to fall, it continues to exact a heavy toll; and
unemployment and poverty rates, though declining, remain high (Tables 1a and 1b).
Botswana still has a way to go to meet all the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs)
(Table 1c).
A. Background
3.

Recent developments have been favorable.

•

After a temporary slowdown, growth in 2006/07 recovered to an estimated
5¾ percent on increases in both mineral and non-mineral activities, including tourism
and manufacturing (Tables 2 and 3 and Figure 2).

•

Inflation has fallen substantially since peaking in April 2006, but it is still near the
top of the BoB target range. The BoB policy interest rate was lowered half a percent to
14½ percent in June. Real interest rates were rising as inflation declined. A large increase
in administered fuel prices in July pushed inflation up but it is still within the BoB
objective of 4–7 percent. M3 has grown steadily and private sector credit rose 19 percent
in July 2007 year-on-year (Tables 4a, 4b, and 4c).

•

Another large fiscal surplus is expected in 2007/08. High revenues from minerals and
the South African Customs Union (SACU) and slow capital spending contributed to a
fiscal surplus of 12 percent of GDP in 2006/07 (Tables 5a and 5b and Figure 3). Staff
project a surplus of 8 percent of GDP in 2007/08, based on robust non-mineral revenues
and lower-than-budgeted spending, compared to a budgeted surplus of 2 percent of GDP.

•

Exchange rates have stabilized in the past year. The pula depreciated significantly in
nominal and real effective terms after devaluations in 2004 and 2005 and the shift in
2005 to a crawling peg (Figure 4).1 Fiscal restraint, capital account outflows, and tight

1

trading partners. The authorities do not disclose the parameters of the crawl.

6
monetary policy have helped to contain inflationary pressures so that the real effective
exchange rate (REER) is now about 10 percent below its pre-2004 peak. The decision in
July 2007 to slow the rate of the crawl because of narrowing inflation differentials
between Botswana and trading partners will also help contain inflation.
•

Continued high mineral prices and a decline in imports contributed to a current
account surplus of almost 19½ percent of GDP in 2006 (Table 6). Copper and nickel
exports surged on a major uptick in prices. International reserves—which include the
Pula Fund of longer-term assets—increased to 25 months of prospective imports of goods
and services by the end of 2006.2

•

The financial sector is healthy but shallow; high systemic excess liquidity is a
continuing problem. Financial sector prudential indicators are solid and the profitability
of the commercial banking system is among the world’s highest (Table 7 and Figure 5).
However, indicators of financial sector depth are well below those of comparable
countries. The stock of BoBCs, the main instrument for absorbing liquidity, has expanded
rapidly in recent years, to about one-quarter of GDP; commercial banks now hold over
half their assets in BoBCs. The rising interest costs of BoBCs, though offset by other
sources of BoB income, reached 3 percent of GDP in 2006.
B. The Medium Term and Risks to the Outlook

4.
The economy is diversifying slowly but will need to meet the challenges of the
expected sharp decline in diamond production some time after 2020.3 Continued and
prospective development of other minerals, including copper, nickel, and coal; large-scale
investment in electricity generation; and some promising non-mineral projects should
support growth, and maintain fiscal and balance of payments surpluses through 2011
(Tables 8, 9a, 9b, and 10 and Text Table on Medium-Term Economic and Financial
Indicators). Nonetheless, the relatively short horizon to where diamond production is
expected to fall off means that non-diamond growth must accelerate significantly before then
to avoid a contraction of the economy. Even in a growing economy, it will be difficult to
replace the government’s high share of diamond export revenues.

2

The Pula Fund, in which the government has accumulated a two-thirds share through fiscal surpluses, is
managed by the BoB.

3

These estimates may be substantially influenced by technological change or new discoveries.

5.

Despite the positive medium-term view, there are a number of risks:

•

The continued dependence on mineral exports and revenues makes the economy
susceptible to a significant decline in the price of diamonds, copper, or nickel. If
growth declines in industrialized and emerging market economies, diamond prices or
sales could drop, with negative effects on Botswana’s fiscal and current account
balances. In addition, non-mineral growth is needed to generate employment.

•

The financial system faces challenges. The sizable pension and insurance sectors are
only lightly supervised, the NBFI regulatory authority is just gearing up, and the rapid
growth in consumer lending in recent years presents untested risks. The interest burden
from the growing stock of BoBCs is high.

•

There are near-terms risks of inflation. Regional drought, which may further push up
food prices; power shortages, which may increase electricity prices; and additional
administrative price adjustments (with one-off effects) may make it difficult for the BoB
to reach its 3–6 percent medium-term inflation objective.
II. REPORT ON THE DISCUSSIONS

6.
Policy discussions focused on three challenges to sustainable growth: (i) fiscal
policies to support longer-term sustainability; (ii) monetary and exchange rate policies to
control inflation, maintain competitiveness, and respond flexibly to shocks; and (iii) financial
and structural reforms to support growth and stability.
A. Fiscal Policies
7.
To contain inflationary pressures and move toward a sustainable medium-term
position, the staff recommended that the authorities aim for a surplus of at least
9-10 percent of GDP this fiscal year (2007/08) through continued efforts to boost
recurrent revenues and restrain expenditures.4 The authorities said the surplus would
likely be considerably higher than budgeted, noting gains from efforts to improve tax
compliance and continued constraints in implementing budgeted capital spending. They
intend to propose a surplus in 2008/09 that is similar to this year’s legislated budget.
8.
In recent years the authorities have met three of their principal fiscal goals by
maintaining surpluses in the overall and non-investment balances5 and limiting public
expenditures to less than 40 percent of GDP. Staff and authorities agreed that a strong and
4

This surplus, if achieved through stronger recurrent revenues or spending restraint, would bring the overall
balance close to a longer-term sustainable level (discussed later).
5

The non-investment balance equals the difference between non-mineral revenues and current expenditures
excluding those for education and health.

9
stable fiscal position and high-quality capital spending would help produce growth, low
inflation and a stable REER. The non-investment surplus goal emphasizes the importance of
preserving the net wealth of the government by avoiding the use of nonrecurring mineral
revenues for recurring expenses and using them instead for capital spending (here defined to
include investment in human capital via public education and health).6 However, the noninvestment balance has drawbacks. It suggests, for instance, that human and physical capital
expenditures are one-off investments, despite the need to replace and expand infrastructure.
9.
Staff recommended that, in addition to their current fiscal goals, the authorities
in the NDP 10 target a reduction in the non-mineral primary deficit. This balance, which
excludes revenues from nonrenewable resources and also interest spending and receipts, can
provide a measure of longer-term fiscal sustainability. A high non-mineral primary deficit is
not sustainable once mineral resources are exhausted. But like the non-investment balance,
this does not address what level of capital spending is optimal. If spending were sufficiently
productive to eventually yield faster future growth of recurrent revenues, a larger nonmineral deficit would be sustainable.
10.
Staff proposed benchmarking a sustainable level of the primary non-mineral
deficit (and hence spending) based on the notion of “permanent income” (Box 1). Using
staff assumptions about the growth of recurrent spending and mineral availability, the
permanent income calculation indicates that the spending ceiling should be reduced from
40 percent of GDP to 30 percent,7 which is close to the estimated outcome for 2006/07. Any
relaxation of share of spending in GDP relative to last year’s outcome should be justified on
the grounds that these expenditures have a rate of return for the government higher than that
on financial savings. The authorities indicated that in view of their ambitious capital
spending objectives and other social needs, and their confidence in the attendant growth of
recurrent revenues, they would adhere to the spending ceiling of 40 percent of GDP. They
are currently developing the macroframework for NDP 10.

6

A number of countries, including the United Kingdom, have adopted a similar kind of indicator, sometimes
termed the “golden rule.”

7

This assumes that spending is limited to non-mineral revenues (assumed to increase from the current
22 percent of GDP to around 23½ percent in 2010/11) and annuitized mineral revenue of about 6⅓ percent of
GDP.

10
Box 1. Calculating Fiscal Sustainability Benchmarks for Botswana
The permanent income hypothesis suggests that Botswana should not spend more than the
“permanent” part of its mineral revenues, saving the rest. The return on these savings would help
sustain fiscal spending once diamonds are depleted. To compute permanent income, the projected stream of
mineral revenues is transformed into a hypothetical expected annuity. It is assumed that diamond
production sharply declines around 2021 but that an annuity using wealth from diamonds will last until
2050 (a realistic time horizon given uncertainty regarding resource discoveries and the growth of nonmineral revenues); the annuitized mineral revenue is modeled to stay constant in terms of GDP.1 The
permanent income then equals the sum of non-mineral revenues plus the annuity. The benchmarked
balances are the result of setting annual expenditures equal to the permanent income and saving the
difference between actual and the hypothetical annuitized mineral revenues (Text Figure).

The benchmarked balances suggest that continued fiscal restraint is needed to achieve fiscal
sustainability. The benchmarked non-mineral balance derived from permanent income suggests a lower
deficit in 2007 and 2015 (corresponding to a higher overall surplus) compared to the projected balance—
with the exception of scenario (c) (see Table below). The higher the assumed return on savings and the
greater the mineral deposits, the lower the benchmarked fiscal adjustment needed for sustainability.
These illustrative calculations are derived from a social welfare function that assumes that it is
socially optimal to smooth expenditure over time, which seems reasonable for a middle-income
country. However, spending more of the mineral revenues upfront could increase social welfare
(depending on the social welfare function, composition of spending, and rate of return of public
investment). The marginal benefit from spending should be greater than the returns on financial assets.

Revenue projections assume a slow increase in non-mineral revenues and a decrease in mineral
revenues in terms of GDP. Expenditure projections assume that capital expenditure and expenditure on
health and other critical areas increase in terms of GDP.
(a) The conservative interest rate assumption refers to a nominal interest interest rate of around 7¾
percent that corresponds to a real interest rate of 3 percent. The past rates of return on the Pula Fund are
unknown. In comparison, the Norwegian Government Pension Fund has earned an annualized net real
return of 4.6 percent since 1997.
(b) The optimistic interest rate assumption refers to a nominal interest interest rate of around 9¼ percent
that corresponds to a real interest rate of about 4½ percent. Being more optimistic concerning the return
on assets allows for somewhat larger non-mineral deficits and lower overall balances relative to (a).
(c) Programming the annuity to stay constant in real terms (rather than in terms of GDP) yields lower
initial savings as suggested by the benchmarks. Thus, this scenario assumes a more back-loaded
adjustment.
(d) Assuming a slower decline in the path of mineral revenues changes the value of the annuity and
thereby allows for higher non-mineral deficits relative to (b).

12
11.
The authorities agreed that increasing non-mineral revenues is essential. The
creation of the Botswana Unified Revenue Service has unified and reinforced administration
of the value-added tax (VAT) and income taxes. Higher cost recovery in parastatal utilities is
helping consolidate the fiscal position and may spur efficiency in services. The authorities
agreed with staff that if mineral revenues or SACU receipts decline, raising the VAT rate to
the regional norm could be one option for offsetting the revenue losses.8
12.
Continued rationalization of public spending is also a government priority. Staff
agreed with the authorities that the comprehensive review of public sector wages that is
nearing completion should be used to rationalize wage policies. Raising public sector
productivity is a high priority for the government, motivating the recent reorganization of the
Ministry of Finance, and would create room for anticipated increases in investment and
HIV/AIDS-related spending.
13.
Staff noted that the creation of an explicit sovereign wealth fund could have
benefits. It could strengthen support for fiscal savings by underscoring the link between
fiscal surpluses now and more stable spending in the future when diamond revenues decline.9
A fund could also emphasize the importance of formulating a comprehensive plan for
management of sovereign wealth and make more clear the high costs of liquidity control.
However, improvements to transparency and the institutional framework, for instance, by
limiting transfers of Pula Fund assets to the Liquidity Portfolio or the use of income on
assets, could also be achieved with the current arrangements of the Pula Fund as part of the
BoB balance sheet. The authorities indicated that they have elected to preserve the existing
institutional arrangements, noting that current arrangement for Pula Fund management gives
them flexibility to maneuver in case of possible simultaneous large external shocks, an
important consideration given the concentration of export earnings.
B. Monetary and Exchange Rate Policies to Control Inflation, Maintain
Competitiveness, and Respond Flexibly to Shocks
14.
Staff and the authorities agreed that since the devaluations in 2004 and 2005 the
policy mix of fiscal restraint, tight monetary policy and the crawling peg exchange rate
8

The Southern African Development Community Free Trade Act is expected to come into effect in August
2008 but is not expected to have any significant immediate revenue consequences for Botswana.

9

Such funds are being considered by several middle-income countries accumulating financial assets and have
been implemented in Chile and Trinidad and Tobago. The Pula Fund has some features of a sovereign wealth
fund in that it seeks to diversify and increase national wealth. However, it is institutionally part of the BoB
balance sheet and thus its assets can be transferred to the Liquidity Portfolio (a tranche of Botswana's
international reserves) and revenues from the Pula Fund currently offset losses incurred from monetary policy
operations (Botswana: Financial Sector Stability Assessment, 2007, Box 2).

13
regime has stabilized the REER, bringing inflation down. Current monetary policy targets
a specific range for inflation, and exchange rate policy also seeks REER stability. Staff noted
that simultaneous achievement of these objectives will not be easy; in a small, open
economy, it is not possible to set the nominal exchange rate, the inflation rate, and the real
exchange rate independently for long. The choice of a nominal anchor should be guided by
the characteristics of the economy, the nature of likely shocks, and the relative strength of
foreign and domestic determinants of inflation. An inflation objective is a possible anchor for
Botswana but achieving it would require some nominal exchange rate flexibility in case of
external shocks.10 Staff therefore recommended that the authorities consider setting a firmer
legal foundation for the price stability objective, consistent with international and regional
trends, by amending the BoB Act.
15.
The authorities indicated that they consider a stable REER to be critical. In their
view, the REER in the past year reached a level conducive to economic diversification. They
also noted that structural reforms should address obstacles to competitiveness in the nonmining sector. The staff analysis suggests that the exchange rate is at about its equilibrium
value in terms of past trends in its determinants (Box 2 and Table 11). However, a forwardlooking assessment, taking into account the need to accumulate savings to sustain imports
after diamond production falls, suggests that slightly larger current account surpluses would
be needed. Moreover, alternative REER indices and structural competitiveness indicators
point to continued need to improve labor productivity and competitiveness.

10

Botswana’s open economy and reliance on diamonds suggest that both real and monetary shocks are
potentially significant, weighing in favor of and against, respectively, a nominal inflation anchor. In addition,
foreign determinants of inflation are significant, while domestic determinants somewhat mitigated, but further
empirical study is required.

small overvaluation. Projected lower surpluses in 2007–11 reflect imports for infrastructure and mining
projects. Sensitivity analysis indicates that a lower discount rate or lower diamond exports would increase
the gap between the projected and sustainable current account (Box Figure 2).

•

An analysis of economic indicators indicates that the REER overvaluation from 2000–2004 mainly
resulted from a pronounced dip in productivity relative to trading partners (Box Figure 3). The 2004 and
2005 devaluations and move to a crawling peg have more than reversed the overvaluation in the CPI-based
REER and have boosted export profitability, especially in non-mining sectors. However, productivity gains
have been modest, especially relative to trading partners, while export volume growth has slowed and the
share of exports of goods and services in GDP has remained flat. The relative productivity trends and
competitiveness rankings suggest that measures to improve labor productivity and the business
environment are crucial for diversification.

16.
The debt sustainability analysis shows little risk of debt distress. It indicates
Botswana’s external debt would remain below 50 percent of GDP in the stress-test scenarios
(Appendix).
17.
Maintaining an appropriate balance between exchange rate and monetary policy
objectives will be critical for building the non-diamond sectors. The recent combination
of lowering the policy interest rate and slowing the rate of crawl was appropriate, because
containing inflation has come at the cost of high real interest rates that deter lending. Further
slowing of the rate of crawl will help reduce inflationary pressures and facilitate additional
gradual reduction of interest rates, which will support non-mineral activities while relieving
pressures on the BoB balance sheet. The still low ratio of credit to GDP suggests
considerable scope for noninflationary monetary deepening.
18.
Staff noted that systemic excess liquidity is impeding the development of
interbank markets and has weakened the monetary policy transmission mechanism.
While improvements in treasury cash management, the channeling of a significant part of
diamond receipts directly to the BoB, and supporting reforms have reduced liquidity, the
growth of the BoBC stock continues to raise concerns. Staff therefore welcomed the
authorities’ intention to roll over the medium-term government bond due in 2008 and
encouraged them to consider the FSAP recommendations to further streamline liquidity
management within the BoB and build the domestic bond market by regular issuance of
government bonds, which would also help create a meaningful yield curve.
C. Financial and Structural Reforms
19.
Botswana’s generally sound financial sector is seeking to meet international
norms, as the FSAP shows. Short-term risks appear to be contained and banking sector
prudential indicators are sound. Botswana is generally observing international standards in
transparency of monetary and financial policies, banking supervision, and payments systems,
and has begun to strengthen oversight of the NBFIs. The recent growth in unsecured
household credit and in collateralized mortgages, which has outpaced growth in business
lending, represents a significant untested risk, though asset quality measures are currently
satisfactory and banks are improving credit risk analysis.11
20.
Staff believe that Botswana’s macroeconomic policies provide a conducive
environment for building on the strengths of the banking sector and addressing
financial sector weaknesses. Financial sector reform is critical for supporting successful
economic diversification and non-diamond growth. Staff welcomed the authorities’
engagement in the FSAP, and their continuing solid commitment to consider its
recommendations.

17
21.

Staff urged the authorities to give priority to:

•

Drawing up a comprehensive financial sector strategy reform plan using a high-level
committee to guide and monitor the reform process;

•

Getting the NBFI Regulatory Authority running, as planned, by the target of January
2008 (Box 3);

•

Further strengthening the BoB’s powers to supervise statutory banks and banking groups
and improving cooperation between the BoB and domestic and cross-border supervisors
in neighboring countries;

•

Improving access to financial services by reforming the panoply of public financial
institutions through privatization and other means; and

•

Continuing to take steps to implement the Financial Action Task Force (FATF)
recommendations on anti-money-laundering and combating the financing of terrorism
(AML/CFT), and setting up the Financial Intelligence Unit.
Box 3. Botswana: Reform of the Nonbank Financial Institutions—Financial Sector
Assessment Program Findings

The authorities have embarked on a plan to upgrade the regulatory system of the NBFIs. A new NBFI
Regulatory Authority Act establishes a single NBFI regulatory agency and provides a more effective platform
for supervision and regulation of NBFIs.
The FSAP underlines implementation challenges. The legal reform agenda is extensive, and there is a need to
improve basic reporting and regulatory surveillance of the NBFIs. The FSAP has stressed the need to begin the
oversight of pension fund administrators and asset managers and to monitor the foreign asset holdings, which
currently stand at around 65 percent of total pension fund assets. The oversight of the insurance sector also
needs strengthening through analysis of statutory returns and regulations on intermediaries and issuance of
market conduct guidelines
The NBFIs could play an important role in developing local financial markets. Meeting the needs of
pension funds to hedge their offshore investments, for example, would offer opportunities to create futures and
forward markets. Botswana’s potential to develop into a regional financial center where regional governments
and corporates may raise capital to finance growth depends upon establishing a benchmark yield curve.

22.
Staff noted that structural reforms are essential to increase productivity,
promote diversification and job creation, and improve policy analysis. The authorities
are making welcome efforts to facilitate expansion of downstream diamond and copper
activities and investments to address the regional power shortage will promote
diversification. The authorities should move ahead with privatization of the large parastatals
as soon as an appropriate regulatory framework is in place. Improving the skills match
through reform of education and vocational training is an important goal.
23.
Strengthening the investment climate must continue to be a priority. Recent
government initiatives to improve the investment climate, especially the new foreign direct

18
investment strategy and competition policy, are welcome. The authorities commented that
they have implemented a number of Foreign Investment Advisory Service (FIAS), including
sharply reducing the time needed to register a new business, acquire a business license, and
get connected to utilities. They also stressed their commitment to addressing concerns about
access to land and work and residence permits for expatriates.
24.
Administered prices for a range of non-tradables may lead to market distortions
and cloud the monetary transmission mechanism. Staff and the authorities agreed that it
would be useful to liberalize prices by instituting more regular price adjustments linked to
market developments.
25.
Botswana’s economic statistics are generally adequate for surveillance, but the
recent Data Quality Assessment and Data Report on the Observance of Standards and
Codes (ROSC) found weaknesses in all key sectors. The authorities have indicated a
strong interest in upgrading their statistical capacities and currently participate in the General
Data Dissemination System (GDDS). A successful transformation of the Central Statistical
Office into an autonomous agency with more skilled staff will make it easier for government
to formulate good policy.
III. STAFF APPRAISAL
26.
Recent economic developments have been positive, and the medium term looks
bright. Non-diamond growth is expected to remain strong and diamond production seems
likely to continue at roughly its current level. Inflation has fallen substantially, though it is
still at risk. High mineral prices are contributing to solid fiscal and balance of payments
surpluses; continued and prospective development of minerals and significant investment in
electricity generation are projected to sustain fiscal and balance of payments surpluses
through 2011. The most obvious risk is the possibility that diamond prices will drop.
27.
Although diversification is progressing, a faster move away from diamonds is
needed to address the sharp decline in diamond production that may occur after 2020.
A number of promising projects are on the horizon, but the next NDP will need to reinforce
the framework for non-mineral growth.
28.
Maintaining fiscal surpluses over the medium term is essential to accumulate
savings for the period when diamond revenues decline. Maintaining expenditures at about
30 percent of GDP, as in 2006/07, and continuing efforts to build non-diamond revenues will
strengthen fiscal sustainability.
29.
Creation of an explicit sovereign wealth fund could be considered. It could help to
galvanize greater support for running fiscal surpluses to smooth the benefits from diamond
revenues over the longer term. It could also lead to an improved institutional framework for
managing government financial assets, though improvements in transparency and the
institutional framework can be achieved with the Pula Fund remaining within the BoB.

19
30.
Striking an appropriate balance between monetary and exchange rate policy
objectives is critical. Devaluation provided a competitive boost to exports, but the
associated high interest rates have raised the cost of capital. Reducing the nominal interest
rate and slowing the rate of crawl were appropriate, and further slowing of the crawl,
consistent with narrowing inflation differentials, will allow additional scope for interest rate
reductions. The REER has stabilized in the past year at close to its equilibrium value.
31.
The banking sector is sound and near-term risks are well contained, as the FSAP
found, but there is still a sizable agenda for financial sector reform. An important
priority is to initiate the NBFI Regulatory Authority by January 2008 and complete the
legislative agenda for pension and insurance reform.
32.
Continued structural reform and improvements in statistics are also essential.
Privatization, properly regulated; reducing the skills mismatch through education reform; and
further improvements in the business environment, especially completing the drafting of an
effective foreign direct investment strategy and competition policy, will help raise
productivity and attract investment. Stronger growth in the non-mineral economy will also
generate employment. Liberalizing administered prices will enhance efficiency, and further
development of the statistical data base will support sound policy analysis.
33.
Botswana has not enacted any restrictions on the making of payments and transfers
for current international transactions since its last Article IV consultation and in August 2007
it removed its one multiple currency practice.
34.
It is recommended that the next Article IV consultation be held on the standard
12-month cycle.

The exchange rate of the Botswana pula is a crawling peg arrangement against a basket of
currencies. As of September 30, 2007, the exchange rate of the U.S. dollar to the pula was
US$1=P6.06, and that of the South African rand to the pula was R1=P0.88.
Directors noted in the context of the 2006 consultation that Botswana maintains a multiple
currency practice (MCP) relating to exchange rate guarantees on one loan and urged the
authorities to take early action to remove that practice. This MCP was eliminated, on August
8, 2007, with the conversion of the outstanding loan under the Foreign Exchange Risk
Sharing scheme to a pula loan.

II. Relations with the World Bank Group
(As of October 29, 2007)
1.
Botswana became a member of the International Bank for Reconstruction and
Development (IBRD) and the International Development Association (IDA) in 1968.
Cumulative commitments from IDA to Botswana include US$17 million for six development
credits for infrastructural development and the livestock sector. The last credit was extended
in 1974. Cumulative commitments from the IBRD to Botswana amount to US$281 million
for 22 loans, of which US$54 million was canceled. The loans were extended for
infrastructure development, the financial sector, land management, livestock development,
and education and health projects. The last loan was extended in 1987. Since the late 1980s,
the Government has not required external borrowing owing to its strong financial and
international reserve position based on diamond mining receipts. As lending phased out, the
Bank’s involvement in Botswana shifted to limited analytical and advisory services.
2.
Over the past decades, Botswana has demonstrated its capacity to address its
development challenges effectively. However, the increasing sophistication of its
development agenda makes it more critical than ever before to introduce international
development experiences. The Government has therefore expressed interest in a closer
partnership to benefit from the World Bank’s comparative advantage in key development
areas. Specifically, it has requested IBRD loans for two projects: one on HIV/AIDS and one
on integrated transport. The HIV/AIDS project (about US$56 million) is scheduled for
delivery in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2008 and the Transport project (about US$110
million) in the first quarter of fiscal year 2009. Given that its upper middle-income status
excludes Botswana from the World Bank’s highly concessional IDA resources, the
Government requested that the proposed HIV/AIDS operation be financed utilizing a
relatively new instrument referred to as an IBRD “buy-down” which involves utilizing donor
resources to lower the cost of an IBRD loan. The release of these donor funds would be
dependent on project performance, with jointly agreed indicators and targets. The European
Commission (EC) has indicated its strong interest in supporting the buy-down. Although
final amounts still have to be confirmed, the EC has suggested that new funds of
approximately US$20.6 million would be available to support this effort. Given the expected
EC contribution and Government’s indicated preference for a 0 percent interest rate, a project
size of approximately US$56 million is proposed over a five-year period. In addition to the
two IBRD operations under preparation, the Government has requested Bank support in the
energy sector. The Bank is initiating discussions with the Government on an IBRD Partial
Risk Guarantee (PRG) and possibly an IBRD loan. The Bank is also preparing a US$5
million GEF grant–financed project on wildlife management and biodiversity conservation.
A first-ever Interim Strategy for Botswana (24 months, Board in March 2008) will provide
the strategic underpinning for the new lending operations and the growing partnership.
3.
Recent Bank analytical work in Botswana includes an Export Diversification Report
in FY05, ROSC on Accounting and Auditing, Livestock Sector Development Strategy, and
Poverty and Social Impact Analysis in fiscal year 2006. The Bank conducted an Investment

7
Climate Assessment in fiscal year 2007; some follow-up work is planned for fiscal year
2008. Through trust funds the Bank is supporting Botswana in statistical capacity building
and monitoring and evaluation. Carbon Finance Assist, the World Bank’s climate change
capacity building program administered by the World Bank Institute, is launching technical
assistance.
4.
Botswana joined the International Finance Corporation (IFC) in 1979, but there
has been little private sector interest in Botswana in IFC financing because high liquidity has
enabled the private sector to raise funds in the domestic market. Cumulative IFC equity and
loan commitments to Botswana total US$10.72 million in five tourism, financial, and mining
enterprises. In fiscal years 1999 and 2000, the IFC made two loan commitments amounting
to US$1.75 million to Abercombie and Kent (Botswana) for accommodation and tourism
services projects in the Okavango Delta. In fiscal year 2001, the IFC made a quasi-equity
investment of US$3 million in the African Banking Corporation aimed at diversifying its
range of financial services and increasing its geographical coverage. In fiscal year 2003, it
approved a US$2 million equity investment in Kalahari Diamonds Limited for exploration in
the Kalahari desert. At the end of 2004, the IFC took an equity stake of US$3.97 million in
Letshego, a consumer finance company that provides short- to medium-term micro loans to
public and private sector employees. IFC is currently negotiating a US$20 million investment
in African Banking Corporation to further support its regional expansion. It has also signed a
mandate to provide Letshego with additional funding through a US$20 million local currency
loan that will also support Letshego’s regional expansion plans.
5.
The IFC has advised the Government of Botswana on privatization and in fiscal
year 2004 the Public Enterprises Evaluation and Privatization Agency gave the IFC the
privatization mandate for Air Botswana. IFC Advisory Services has been selected as
Transaction Advisor for the structuring of a public-private partnership for the proposed
Botswana International University of Science and Technology. The Corporation is also at the
early stage of engaging on the privatization of Botswana Telecommunications Corporation.
6.
In 2004, the Foreign Investment Advisory Service completed a review of the
commercial law, administrative and registration costs, and barriers to investment in
Botswana.
7.
Botswana joined the Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency (MIGA) in 1988;
MIGA has no exposure and no active applications in Botswana.

III. Statistical Issues
1.
Data provision is adequate to conduct surveillance, but there are some shortcomings.
The accuracy of data, particularly for the national accounts and balance of payments, needs
improvement. In addition, the current arrangements according to which balance of payments
statistics are compiled on a calendar-year basis, the national accounts on a July-June
schedule, and the budget on an April-March schedule, hamper the accuracy and integration
of economic data and the analysis of savings-investment balances.
2.
A ROSC reassessment took place October 31-November 13, 2006 and the report,
along with the authorities’ response, was published on April 6, 2007. Cross-cutting
recommendations were to monitor the consistency of the main macroeconomic datasets and
reconcile differences regularly; establish a list of institutional units consistent with
sectorization in the 1993 System of National Accounts (1993 SNA), to be applied consistently
across all datasets; and support greater use of preliminary data by formalizing revision
policies and implementing regular revision cycles.
3.
As one of 22 countries participating in the Fund’s General Data Dissemination
System (GDDS) Project for Anglophone African Countries, Botswana has undertaken to use
the GDDS as framework for the development of its national statistical system. Botswana is
participating in the monetary and financial statistics modules of the Anglophone Africa
project (funded by the U.K. Department for International Development (DFID)). This project
aims to assist participating countries to implement plans for improvement identified in the
metadata, which were posted on the Fund’s Dissemination Standards Bulletin Board on
October 24, 2002.
National Accounts and Prices
4.
Using the production and expenditure approaches, national accounts are now
principally based on the concepts and definitions recommended by the 1993 SNA, in line
with the strong commitment of the authorities to migrate to the 1993 SNA, but some changes
are needed for full observance. For instance, classification and sector breakdowns are still
broadly in line with 1968 SNA. Differences in the accounting periods and in the timing of
recording between national accounts, balance of payments, and government finance statistics
are still hindering the accuracy of estimates. Staff have encouraged the authorities to expedite
the planned move to harmonize the accounting periods over the medium term. It would be
important to conduct comprehensive enterprise surveys every few years and introduce
estimates for the informal sector. Detailed recommendations are contained in the April 2007
ROSC report.
5.
The consumer price index is comprehensive and provides breakdowns between urban
and rural areas and between tradable (domestic and imported) and nontradables. The
Classification of Individual Consumption by Purpose (COICOP) in the rebased CPI
(September 2006) broadly conforms with the guidelines of 1993 SNA and the CPI Manual,
although there are still deviations with respect to the imputation of rents and owner-occupied
housing. Estimates from the Household Income and Expenditure Survey (HIES) are used for

9
the weights of market expenditure for goods and services. With respect to the wholesale price
index (WPI), the ROSC mission recommended the development of concepts and definitions
to meet the needs of data users. The Central Statistics Office is to decide whether to produce
an output index (PPI), an Intermediate Consumption Index or a Supply Price Index.
Currently, the WPI of industrial output is not representative of industrial production, because
it measures changes in the prices of only six product groups.
Fiscal accounts
6.
The concepts and definitions used in compiling central government finance statistics
generally follow the methodology of the IMF’s Government Finance Statistics Manual
(GFSM 1986) but cover only budgetary central government activities.. No fiscal statistics are
compiled for extrabudgetary institutions and consolidated central government. The
classification used for budgetary central government partially follows the concepts of GFSM
1986. Detail on some components of current spending is lacking. Transactions are recorded
on a cash basis consistent with the GFSM 1986 guidelines. In general, the statistics
disseminated in official publications are presented clearly and are made available to all users
simultaneously. The data ROSC mission recommended at least annual compilation and
dissemination of GFS for extrabudgetary institutions, and the consolidated general
government. The authorities have yet to decide on a suitable “migration path” to adopt the
GFSM 2001 methodology. The authorities regularly report monthly data on budgetary central
government for inclusion in the International Financial Statistics, but no data are reported
for inclusion in the Government Finance Statistics Yearbook.
7.
The periodicity of central government finance statistics meets GDDS standards,
except for timeliness. It should be noted that information is available to permit compilation
and dissemination of government finance statistics within the GDDS recommendations.
Monetary accounts
8.
The Bank of Botswana’s (BoB) compilation of the depository corporations survey is
generally consistent with the methodology recommended in the Fund’s Monetary and
Financial Statistics Manual (MFSM). The survey covers BoB and all other depository
corporations that issue liabilities included in the national definition of broad money as
recommended in the MFSM. Classification and sectorization are largely consistent with
MFSM, except for the classification of financial derivatives. In addition, some nonbudgetary
central government units are classified as nonfinancial public corporations and accrued
interest is not consistently presented together with the underlying instrument.
9.
Monetary data for publication in International Financial Statistics are reported
regularly using Standardized Report Forms. Although reporting is more timely, data
concerning the central bank are still being reported to STA with a longer lag than those for
the other depository corporations.

10
External sector statistics
10.
The concepts, structure and definitions of the balance of payments statistics follow
the fifth edition of the Balance of Payments Statistics Manual (BPM5). Institutional
classifications generally follow BPM5, although data sources raise minor issues, in particular,
administrative sources using definitions and classifications that deviate from BPM5. Source
data are adequate, but International Transaction Reporting System (ITRS) data, used mostly
for services, have become unreliable, and alternative data sources are needed. Data
compilation, estimation, and adjustments mostly employ sound techniques. However, the
methods for estimating missing data and calculating flows from stock data are inadequate.
11.
Balance of payments statistics are compiled and published in the BoB’s monthly
statistical bulletin and the Annual Report, thus meeting GDDS periodicity and timeliness
recommendations, although only annual balance of payments statistics are reported to STA
for publication. There are discrepancies with national accounts statistics concerning imports,
exports, and payments related to settlements within the Southern African Customs Union
(SACU), mainly due to different data sources and valuation methods.

Statement by Peter Gakunu, Executive Director for Botswana and
Ita Mary Mannathoko, Advisor to Executive Director
December 7, 2007
1.

Introduction

The Botswana authorities appreciate the constructive analysis and useful dialogue with staff
during this year’s Article IV consultation, as well as the well-researched inputs they provided
during the Bank of Botswana (BOB) seminar. They thank staff for the well written,
constructive and balanced report and selected issues paper, as well as for the FSAP
assessment. They also thank the Deputy Managing Director Mr. Kato, for his participation in
the concluding meetings of the mission and for his generous comments during his visit.
2.

Background

Effective resource management, good governance and prudent macroeconomic policies have
contributed to Botswana’s sustained growth performance. Standard and Poors, and Moodys
rating agencies have consistently given the country strong ratings. In August 2007, Moody’s
Investors Service retained Botswana’s sovereign credit ratings of A2, Prime-1 and A1, for
government debt, long term foreign currency debt, and short term foreign currency debt,
respectively. It also upgraded the foreign currency outlook from “stable” to “positive”. The
World Economic Forum ratings for global competitiveness, quality of public institutions, and
sustainable development; the World Bank's governance indicators for measures such as
human rights and accountability, political stability, public service delivery, regulatory
quality, rule of law and control of corruption; and the Global Economic Freedom Network,
Freedom House, Carnegie Endowment, and Heritage Foundation ratings for economic
freedom and openness, have consistently placed Botswana among the top in Africa.
Notwithstanding these ratings, the authorities are conscious of the fact that in many areas, the
economy lags behind comparator nations. The expectation of taxpayers is that the
government should enable a quality of life at a level commensurate with its classification as
an upper middle income country.
3.

Recent Economic Developments and Outlook

The Botswana economy remains robust. Over the past year, macroeconomic stability has
been preserved as reflected in the drop in inflation from a high of 14.2 percent in April 2006
to 7.3 percent in October 2007. However, as world prices for petroleum continue to rise and
food shortages caused by drought and new bio-fuel demand emerge, inflationary pressures
will remain. For the external sector, greater real exchange rate stability has now been attained
at a level closer to the long run equilibrium. The past year has also seen a continued
strengthening of the country’s financial position with growing reserves in the wake of
balance of payments and fiscal surpluses. The 2006 current account surplus was over 19
percent of GDP. Meanwhile in 2007/08 another fiscal surplus is likely, given projected

2
SACU revenues and recent gains from improved tax collection. In the real sector, the high
growth rate of 9.2 percent in the year ending June 2005 was followed by a temporary decline
in growth reflecting the dominant influence of cyclical fluctuations in diamond output on
overall GDP growth. Growth is now estimated to have picked up again in 2006/07 to 5.8
percent, with renewed business expansion as new investments come on stream in the mining,
electricity, manufacturing and tourism sectors. Prospects for economic diversification away
from diamond mining have improved.
In recent years, progress in human welfare has also been evident in the sharp reduction in
unemployment and poverty levels, as well as in HIV/AIDS infection rates. Over the decade
ending 2005/06, an annual average employment growth rate of 4.7 percent was achieved,
enabling the unemployment rate to drop from 21.5 percent to 17.6 percent. Poverty levels
declined from 47 percent in 1994 to 30 percent in 2004, while Botswana’s HIV infection
levels at 17.1 percent of the population overall are now lower than those recorded in
neighboring states for the 15 to 49 age cohort. Nevertheless, while these indicators show
improvement, the rates remain high. Consequently the authorities are committed to
implementing policies and projects designed to increase productive employment and help
avert the adverse social effects that would arise from a large young population without
productive occupation.
4.

Performance on the Sustainable Growth and Economic Diversification Program

Botswana’s twenty-year strategy, Vision 2016 has the development of a “prosperous,
productive and innovative nation” as one of its pillars. The Vision targets a diversified
economy in which agriculture, industry, mining and services are all productive and vital
components of economic activity, development is sustainable, and diversification is
structured to substantially raise broad-based incomes. These priorities will require timely
implementation of scheduled reforms, to allow for continued diversification within the
mining sector and the rapid expansion of the private sector. Thus, while macroeconomic
stability continues to be preserved, the acceleration of remaining reforms and the
implementation of productive development projects is needed to place the non-mining
economy on a higher growth trajectory, reduce unemployment especially among the youth,
and raise welfare and household income levels to the Vision’s targeted level, within a
decade.
The economic pillar of Vision 2016 is being implemented through consecutive national
development plans. In recent plans, the authorities have embarked on a program of
sustainable growth and economic diversification. Under the current plan NDP 9, various
structural reforms targeted at supporting private sector-led investment and growth are being
implemented. As a result of ongoing efforts, there are now major new mineral-linked projects
underway in Botswana, including the Diamond Trading Company (Botswana) and associated
down-stream manufacturing activities. Other mineral and energy sector projects include the
coal-based Mmamabula Export Power Station which was fast tracked this year with all
agreements concluded and implementation scheduled to start within the year. Preparatory
work for the expansion of the existing Morupule Power Station is also ongoing, with

3
construction expected to start at year-end. At the same time, a major new refinery is being
built at the Tati Nickel Mine.
As with diamond polishing, it too will process raw material, to add value.
While the mineral sector supports growth, the authorities recognize the importance of
infrastructure necessary for more rapid non-mining sector expansion, economic
diversification and sustainable growth over the long term. In addition, to improve service
delivery, the government has undertaken to construct four dams, speed-up implementation of
the rural electrification and rural telecommunication programmes, and to connect all public
facilities in villages where there is backbone telecommunication infrastructure. Care is being
taken by the authorities to phase these construction activities to ensure cost-effective and
timely completion. While large investments are being financed by both the private sector in
the mineral sector and the public sector in infrastructure, many smaller investments are being
made by the private sector, revealing renewed confidence in the Botswana economy.
5.

Addressing Implementation Constraints

The authorities are well aware of the need to boost implementation capacity in line with the
program for sustainable growth and diversification. In the past, implementation of projects
had been delayed by the need to meet the requirements of Environmental Impact
Assessments, slow land allocation, poor performance of some contractors and service
providers, as well as slow project design and tendering procedures. Consequently, particular
attention is being given to addressing the bottlenecks. With this in mind and in addition to
ongoing capacity development in line Ministries, government is monitoring project
implementation more closely, while also liberalizing project implementation procedures to
enable its agencies to more readily augment government and local contracting capacity by
employing rated international construction companies, along with skilled and experienced
manpower to help in implementing projects.
6.

Fiscal Policy

The authorities expect fiscal surpluses in the near term. Even so, the next national
development plan (NDP 10) will need to give increased attention to the framework for nonmineral growth with the possibility of a reduction in the non-mineral primary deficit. The
Mid-Term Review of NDP 9 reassessed the Fiscal Rule to ensure that it is consistent with
what is required to achieve the country’s vision and in particular the goal of sustainable
economic diversification. Under the Fiscal Rule, expenditure has been smoothed out - set at a
stable level over time that will allow for the achievement of current goals in the growth and
diversification program. The authorities concur nevertheless, that more analysis should be
done for NDP 10 to provide a more detailed analytic framework incorporating updated
projections of future mineral receipts. Once mineral revenues or SACU receipts decline, the
authorities agree that options to off-set these losses will have to be explored, and this may
include another VAT increase. In the mean time, authorities are continuing to work at
improving tax compliance and enhancing non-mineral revenue collection. At the same time,
rationalization of public spending continues and in this respect, there may be opportunity to
rationalize wage policies as part of the current review of public sector wages.

4

On long term savings, the authorities felt that the Pula Fund had served them well so far.
Nevertheless they agree to review current work being done on sovereign wealth funds and in
this respect, one of the Deputy Governors of the Bank of Botswana participated in the recent
IMF seminar on this subject.
7.

Monetary, Exchange Rate and Financial Sector Policies

The real effective exchange rate has stabilized close to its equilibrium value in the past year
as a result of fiscal restraint and tight monetary policy. Nevertheless, the authorities are
cognizant of the importance of ensuring an appropriate balance between monetary and
exchange rate objectives, in order to support competitiveness, and are looking more closely at
this issue. In the monetary sector, the authorities acknowledge that systemic excess liquidity
and the rising stock of Bank of Botswana certificates remain a challenge. They are committed
to finding a solution to this issue, and government’s rolling over of the Pula bond in 2008 is a
step in this direction.
In the financial sector, the banking industry is financially sound, solvent, profitable and
liquid, with banks maintaining prudential ratios in excess of current statutory requirements,
and low ratios of non-performing loans. However, it remains shallow with indicators well
below those of comparator countries. The authorities have also noted the rapidly changing
financial landscape and are aware of the sizable financial sector regulation and development
agenda necessitated by the rapid expansion in the non-bank financial sector. For this reason,
they are beginning to put in place systems and a broad reform plan going forward. They
appreciate the work done by the Fund and the Bank in the recent FSAP assessment and hope
to continue to draw on the Fund’s Technical Assistance where necessary now that an
autonomous Financial Supervisory Authority has been set up to regulate and supervise nonbank financial institutions.
8.

Structural reforms

Raising productivity remains a priority. To this end, the government is committed to reforms
aimed at creating a conducive environment for business. After some initial delays, progress is
now being made in implementing reforms recommended by the foreign investment advisory
services (FIAS) report of the World Bank. Company registration procedures have been
simplified resulting in a reduction in the time taken to register a company. The Industrial
Development Act was amended to reduce the waiting period for licenses to one week. The
Copyright and Neighbouring Rights Act was amended to better protect the copyright of
artists against piracy and infringements. There have been legislative reforms and
computerization in the area of land management and allocation. Market access for Botswana
goods and services is being enhanced through bilateral and multilateral trade negotiations,
while recognizing the challenge of competition this introduces for local producers, where
reciprocity is required.
In addition to the on-going public service reforms, measures adopted to improve efficiency
include the introduction of Public Private Partnership (PPP) approaches to projects, outsourcing of some public services to the private sector, and rationalization of some public

5
enterprises to avoid duplication of roles. While the government remains committed to
privatization and commercialization in line with the Privatization Policy Master Plan, it
believes that the process should be done through proper consultation with concerned
stakeholders, and in a transparent manner.
Other efforts to improve efficiency will require a review of administered prices to assess
where it may be appropriate to introduce a market-linked adjustment mechanism. Some price
increases are a one-off occurrence, such as the recently re-introduced school fees (for those
above a stipulated income level) under the government’s cost-sharing scheme. With respect
to government data systems, consideration would continue to be given to the possibility of
transforming the Central Statistics Office into a more efficient, autonomous agency.
9.

Conclusion

Over the next few years, significant investments will come on stream in the infrastructure,
education and mineral sectors. The infrastructure and higher education investments will help
to release the potential for higher sustainable growth, and for diversification, in line with the
goals of the ninth national development plan. Private sector investments in mining and
manufacturing will also support these goals. The authorities realize, however, that the
stimulus to growth that is expected may not be enough to make up fully for the slower than
targeted growth during the first half of NDP 9. Notwithstanding the scaled up activity, the
authorities remain committed to raising productivity, ensuring efficient investments, and
maintaining macroeconomic stability.
In closing, we welcome the fact that the recent dialogue between the authorities and the staff
has been fruitful. We wish to reiterate the authorities strong commitment to measures needed
to address economic challenges ahead and trust that the Fund will continue to be responsive
in providing the technical assistance requested by the authorities to strengthen their ability to
put in place essential systems and implement necessary measures.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
February 8, 2008

International Monetary Fund
700 19th Street, NW
Washington, D. C. 20431 USA

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2007 Article IV Consultation with
Botswana
On December 7, 2007 the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF)
concluded the Article IV consultation with Botswana.1
Background
Sound macroeconomic policies, good governance, and high investment have moved
Botswana well into the ranks of middle-income countries. Real GDP growth has averaged
4½ percent for the past four years, a solid performance, but below the expectations of the
National Development Plan 9, which ends with fiscal year 2008/09 (April 2008-March
2009). Inflation has fallen close to the average for the South African rand area, and
balance of payments and fiscal surpluses have built reserves and reduced Botswana’s
already low external debt.
Despite impressive progress in raising living standards, the incidence of poverty,
unemployment, and HIV/AIDS are still high, although they have all declined recently.
Botswana has made substantial progress but still has a considerable way to go to meet all
the Millennium Development Goals by 2015.

1

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On
return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the
Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of
the Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to
the country's authorities.

2
After a temporary slowdown, growth recovered in 2006/07 to an estimated 5¾ percent,
thanks to increased non-mineral as well as mineral activity, especially in tourism and
manufacturing. Inflation has fallen substantially since peaking in April 2006 and has
stabilized just around the upper limit of the authorities’ inflation objective of 4–7 percent. In
June, the Bank of Botswana (BoB) lowered its policy interest rate half a percent, to
14½ percent. Money supply (M3) has grown steadily and private sector credit rose 19
percent in July 2007 year-on-year.
The fiscal surplus rose substantially in 2006/07 to 12 percent of GDP, as a result of higher
revenues from minerals and the South African Customs Union (SACU) combined with
slowed capital spending. Another large surplus is expected in 2007/08. Continued high
mineral prices and a decline in imports contributed to a current account surplus of almost
19½ percent of GDP in 2006, and international reserves increased to 25 months of
prospective imports of goods and services.
Exchange rates have stabilized in the past year. The pula depreciated significantly in
nominal and real effective terms after devaluations in 2004 and 2005 and the shift in 2005
to a crawling peg. The rate of crawl of the pula is set at the difference between the inflation
objective and the forecast inflation of Botswana’s trading partners. Fiscal restraint, capital
account outflows, and tight monetary policy have helped to contain inflationary pressures
so that the real effective exchange rate (REER) is now about 10 percent below its peak
before the 2004 devaluation.
Over the medium term, continued and prospective development of diamonds, copper,
nickel, and coal; large-scale investment in electricity generation; and some promising nonmineral projects should support growth and maintain fiscal and balance of payments
surpluses through 2011. But further enhancement of non-mineral growth is necessary to
offset the expected sharp decline in diamond production sometime after 2020. Even in a
growing economy, it will be difficult for the government to replace the high share of
diamond export revenues it currently receives.
Executive Board Assessment
Directors commended Botswana’s continued impressive record of sound macroeconomic
policies and good governance, which has moved the country into the ranks of middleincome countries. Directors welcomed the recent increase in growth and reduction in
inflation, as well as the continued strong balance of payments and fiscal surpluses. They
urged the authorities to sustain their recent success at reducing the incidence of poverty,
unemployment, and HIV/AIDS, and to continue to strive to meet all the Millennium
Development Goals.
Directors observed that, despite this impressive record, Botswana faces the challenges of
diversifying the sources of growth and reducing the economy’s heavy dependence on
diamond production. While a number of promising projects, such as in electricity
generation, will contribute to a broadening of the economic base and to growth prospects

3
in the medium term, Directors called for the next National Development Plan to incorporate
structural reforms aimed at strengthening further the environment for non-mineral-based
activities.
Directors agreed that securing a strong and stable fiscal position and high-quality capital
spending will help support growth, as will a further strengthening of non-mineral revenues.
They commended the authorities for attaining their principal fiscal goals of maintaining
surpluses in the overall and non-investment balances, and limiting public expenditures to
less than 40 percent of GDP. At the same time, many Directors advocated a spending
ceiling of closer to 30 percent of GDP--still leaving room for the growth of HIV/AIDS-related
and capital spending. Many also suggested considering an additional fiscal policy
benchmark, based on permanent mineral income estimations, to set the non-mineral
primary deficit at a sustainable level.
On the other hand, some Directors saw merit in maintaining the present fiscal strategy,
which is working well and would better ensure that resources are available for
infrastructure investments and human capital development. Directors welcomed the sound
management of the Pula Fund, while recommending adjustments to its institutional
framework to strengthen public savings and promote transparency. In this context, a few
Directors referred to the possibility of establishing an explicit sovereign wealth fund
independent of the central bank’s balance sheet.
Turning to monetary and exchange rate policies, Directors observed that the last
devaluation of the pula had provided a boost to exports, but real interest rates had
remained high. They therefore supported the early summer 2007 reduction of the nominal
interest rate and the slowing of the rate of crawl of the pula exchange rate. A further
slowing of the rate of crawl would help reduce inflationary pressures. From a longer-term
perspective, Directors noted the difficulties of striking an appropriate balance between the
authorities’ monetary and exchange rate policy objectives, with most Directors advising the
authorities to focus on price stability going forward. Competitiveness concerns could best
be addressed by advancing structural reforms and improving the business environment.
Directors endorsed the recent measures to reduce excess liquidity, including improving
treasury cash management. They encouraged the authorities to sustain these efforts to
ease the burden on the Bank of Botswana.
Directors welcomed the conclusions of the recent Financial Sector Assessment Program
that the banking sector is sound and near-term risks are well contained. At the same time,
they encouraged the authorities to formulate a comprehensive financial sector reform plan
to address the remaining agenda for financial deepening. They looked forward to the full
implementation of the nonbank financial institutions regulatory authority in January 2008,
the completion of the pension and insurance reform legislation, and the strengthening of
the Anti Monetary Laundering and Combating the Financing of Terrorism (AML/CFT)
framework through the establishment of the Financial Intelligence Unit.

4
Directors encouraged the authorities to lay the groundwork for further structural reforms
going forward, in order to support non-mineral growth. They called for the privatization of
large parastatals within an appropriate regulatory framework, and for further efforts to build
human capital, develop the private sector, and enhance Botswana’s attractiveness to
foreign direct investment.
Directors noted that Botswana’s economic statistics are generally adequate for
surveillance. They supported the continued upgrading of Botswana’s statistical capacity.
Public Information Notices (PINs) form part of the IMF's efforts to promote transparency of the IMF's
views and analysis of economic developments and policies. With the consent of the country
(or countries) concerned, PINs are issued after Executive Board discussions of Article IV consultations
with member countries, of its surveillance of developments at the regional level, of post-program
monitoring, and of ex post assessments of member countries with longer-term program engagements.
PINs are also issued after Executive Board discussions of general policy matters, unless otherwise
decided by the Executive Board in a particular case. The staff report (use the free Adobe Acrobat
