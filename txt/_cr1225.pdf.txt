STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2011 ARTICLE IV CONSULTATION
January 13, 2012

KEY ISSUES
Context: Norway’s economy has experienced steady recovery, aided by supportive
policies, with low unemployment and the output gap nearly closed. Going forward,
moderately paced, domestic demand-led growth is projected to continue. Inflation—
currently low due in part to krone appreciation—is expected to rise gradually to the 2½
percent target by 2013. This relatively benign central scenario is subject to significant
risks, including from possible intensification of the eurozone crisis. The major domestic
risk arises from elevated house prices and high household debt levels.
Financial sector policy: The top near-term macroeconomic priority is to reduce risks
arising from high household debt by tightening macroprudential standards for
mortgage lending while undertaking tax reforms to gradually reduce incentives for
excessive leverage. Creating a stronger institutional framework for macroprudential
policy would also assist risk mitigation going forward.
Fiscal policy: With the output gap closing, fiscal tightening is needed over the medium
term in the central scenario to rebuild precautionary buffers and ensure the fiscal
guidelines are met on average over the cycle. Medium-term tightening will also (i)
reduce long-run fiscal challenges, which should be further addressed through
entitlement reform, and (ii) allow Norges Bank to keep interest rates low for longer,
thus reducing risks of excessive krone appreciation and associated competitiveness
problems. For 2012, however, the budget’s broadly neutral fiscal stance is appropriate,
given heightened global risks and assuming macroprudential tightening.
Monetary policy: With inflation expected to return to target by the end of the policy
horizon, the current monetary stance is appropriate for now. However, monetary policy
should be the first line of defense if risks materialize.

THE MACROECONOMIC SETTING
A. Supportive Policies Have Facilitated Steady Recovery
1.
Norway is experiencing a steady,
domestic demand-led recovery (Figures 1
and 2). Relative to its peers, Norway’s
mainland economy had a relatively mild
downturn during the 2008-09 global financial
crisis. It then grew by 2.1 percent in 2010 and
is estimated to have grown by around 2½
percent in 2011, bringing real mainland GDP
nearly 3 percent above its pre-crisis level and
nearly closing the output gap (Annex I).
Growth has been led by private consumption

activity. Meanwhile, investment in the oil
sector has rebounded following a sharp
contraction in 2010.2

on the back of rising house prices and robust
wage growth, which in turn have been buoyed
by low interest rates and improving terms of
trade.1 The recovery in the housing market has
also spurred a strong increase in construction
1

Of these factors, a fitted consumption function—
following Jansen, E. (2010), “Wealth Effects on
Consumption in Financial Crises: The Case of Norway”,
Discussion Paper No. 616, Statistics Norway—suggests
that consumption growth during the past year was
primarily driven by a rebound in real disposable
income, though wealth effects are also significant in
Norway.

2.
Steady growth has kept the labor
market strong (Figure 3). Norway entered the
recession with its labor market in a robust
position, with the unemployment rate reaching
a low of 2¼ percent in the first quarter of
2008. Given the relatively shallow recession
and high public-sector employment, the
unemployment rate increased by only 1¼
percentage points during the downturn.
Employment growth in the private sector has
since strengthened, with firm surveys pointing
to increasing hiring intentions. The gradual
tightening of the labor market and the
consequent moderation in the unemployment
rate—to a low 3¼ percent as of October
2011—has caused real wage growth to
accelerate from below 1 percent in late 2009
to 2½ percent by mid-2011.

3.
This recovery partly reflects strong
policy stimulus deployed during the crisis,
which the authorities have begun to slowly
withdraw over the last two years:




Fiscal policy: The government deployed
fiscal stimulus (as measured by the change
in the structural non-oil budget deficit) of
2 percent of trend mainland GDP in 2009.
Fiscal policy then turned broadly neutral in
2010 and 2011. Together with strong
returns on Norway’s sovereign wealth
fund—the Government Pension FundGlobal (GPF-G)—this brought the
structural non-oil deficit back below 4
percent of the GPF-G’s capital, the
benchmark target under Norway’s fiscal
guidelines, from which the government
can deviate temporarily for cyclical
reasons.
Monetary policy: The key policy rate was
reduced by a total of 4½ percentage
points from October 2008 to June 2009,
bringing the rate to a historic low of 1¼
percent. As Norway’s cyclical position
started to improve, a tightening stance was
adopted, with quarter-point rate hikes in
October 2009, December 2009, May 2010,
and May 2011. With the global outlook
weakening and the European Central

Banking (ECB) lowering rates, Norges Bank
then cut the policy rate by 50 basis points
in December 2011, bringing it to its current
level of 1¾ percent.



Financial sector policy: The authorities
implemented a series of measures during
the recession to bolster financial stability.
These included easier collateral
requirements for access to central bank
liquidity, a program that allowed banks to
exchange less-liquid covered bonds for
more-liquid government securities,
purchases of corporate bonds, and bank
capital injections. Reliance on these
exceptional measures was gradually
reduced as the economy recovered.

B. A Strong Exchange Rate Has Contributed to Low Inflation
4.
Despite buoyant domestic demand,
inflation remains muted. Headline CPI
inflation is running at 0.2 percent as of
December 2011 (Figure 4). This very low rate is
partly due to transitory effects from volatile
electricity prices. However, inflation excluding
energy products and tax changes (CPI-ATE)—a
key measure of core inflation in Norway—is
also muted at 1 percent. Indeed, this is one of
the lowest rates of core inflation amongst

rates (Figure 5). This appreciation and the
resulting low growth of import prices (which
takes several months to fully pass through)
explains much of Norway’s low core inflation
relative to many advanced economies, as
imported goods constitute 30 percent of
Norway’s consumption basket.

Exchange rate appreciation has been
a major contributor to recent inflation
developments. Following a significant
depreciation during the early part of the global
financial crisis, the Norwegian krone has since
rebounded and is now around its pre-crisis

C. Improved Terms of Trade Have Boosted the External Sector
6.
The impact of strong domestic
demand and an appreciating krone on the
non-oil trade balance has been offset by
improving terms of trade. Following the
recovery in domestic demand, import volumes
have rebounded significantly (Figure 5). Key
non-oil exports—such as aluminum and
nickel—have also rebounded due to higher
demand from rapidly growing emerging
markets, though at a slower pace than imports.
The fall in non-oil net export volumes,
however, has not translated into a
deteriorating non-oil trade balance—which
has been broadly stable at around -7 percent
of mainland GDP—due to improvements in

Standard metrics suggest the krone
is moderately overvalued, though Norway’s
non-oil exports continue to perform well.
Several “rule-of-thumb” measures point to
some krone overvaluation: purchasing power
parity measures, for example, indicate that
Norway’s price level is high relative to
countries with similar income levels. Similarly,
although the CPI-based REER has been
relatively stable, rapid wage growth has
resulted in strong appreciation of the ULCbased REER, leaving it substantially higher than
its historical average. More refined measures

account norms that take into account changes
in the value of oil wealth over time—point to
overvaluation of around 12 percent (Annex II).
Nonetheless, the non-oil sector in Norway
appears to remain internationally competitive.
Market shares for Norway’s main non-oil
exports have remained stable, if not slightly
increasing, over the last decade. Still, further
appreciation of the krone, continued high
wage growth, or a turnaround in the terms of
trade would likely strain the profitability of the
non-oil export and import-competing sectors
going forward.

D. House Prices and Private-Sector Debt Levels Remain High
8.
Despite broadly favorable
macroeconomic performance, imbalances
built up prior to the downturn persist. In the
run-up to the recession, household debt—
mainly mortgage debt—increased rapidly,
reaching 200 percent of disposable income by
early 2008 (Figure 6), twice the euro area
average of 102 percent. During the downturn,
the impact of falling incomes on households’
debt-servicing capacity was mitigated by the
drop in interest rates, given that about 95
percent of mortgages are at variable rates.

Since the recession, households’ debt-toincome ratio has stabilized, reflecting a
somewhat higher saving rate. However, the
debt ratio remains high and masks even more
concerning developments at the high end of
the distribution, where a growing share of
households have debt-to-income ratios in
excess of 500 percent. The ratio of nonfinancial
corporate sector debt to GDP in Norway is also
high relative to peers, but nonfinancial
corporations have a positive net financial asset
position (Figure 6).
9.
Housing valuations continue to
appear on the high side. House prices grew
at an annual rate of 11 percent during the
period 2004–07, much higher than the OECD
average of 5½ percent. Prices dipped briefly
during the recession, but then resumed their

upward trend during the recovery, supported
by sharp interest rate cuts and rebounding
disposable income. House prices are now 20
percent higher than they were at end-2007.
Standard metrics, such as price-to-rent and
price-to-income ratios, indicate a risk of
overvaluation. Indeed, the deviation of
Norway’s price-to-rent ratio from its historical
average is the highest amongst all OECD
economies. Model-based estimates that take
into account a range of indicators suggest that
price overvaluation could be in the range of
15-20 percent, though there is admittedly a
high amount of uncertainty around this
estimate (Annex III).

E. Financial Sector Balance Sheets Improving, but Vulnerabilities Remain
10.
Credit growth has picked up, driven
by demand from both households and
corporates (Figures 7 and 8). Following a
moderation during the recession due to sharp
declines in bank borrowing by the nonfinancial
corporate sector, credit growth has begun to
accelerate and is currently growing at an
annual rate of 6½ percent. Norges Bank’s
survey of banks points to strong demand for
credit, particularly from households, likely

14

driven by the relatively low levels of interest
rates, low unemployment, and increases in
house prices.
11.
The financial sector has made
progress in bolstering its balance sheets as
it moves toward Basel III compliance
(Figures 9 and 10). Tier-1 capital ratios have
increased during the recovery due to higher
retained profits on the back of strong earnings

growth. Although changes to risk weights
through the use of internal models have
helped boost the average tier-1 ratio, the ratio
of bank capital to total assets has also
increased during the recovery. However, the
largest bank, DNB, which accounts for about a
third of lending, will still have to raise its core
tier 1 ratio from 7.9 percent to 9 percent by
June 2012 to meet European Banking
Authority requirements. DNB has said it will

Funding remains a key vulnerability.
Norwegian banks finance almost 20 percent of
their assets with short-term foreign wholesale
funds. This funding structure exposes banks to
disruptions in global interbank markets, as
experienced during the post-Lehman market
freeze and more recently due to the euro area
crisis. The shortage of adequate liquid assets
and the low deposit-to-loan ratio will make it
difficult for Norwegian banks to meet the
proposed Liquidity Coverage Ratio and Net
Stable Funding ratios, as currently tabled by
the Basel Committee.

The growing importance of
mortgage companies continues to affect
the structure of Norway’s financial sector.
Starting in 2007, new legislation allowed
specialized mortgage institutions—many of
which are owned by banks—to raise funds by
issuing covered bonds. This has increased the
importance of these institutions, which now
account for nearly half of new mortgages, and
has been a factor supporting the buoyant
housing market. It has also made the financial
sector as a whole relatively more reliant on
covered bond financing relative to deposits.

OUTLOOK, RISKS, AND SPILLOVERS
14.
In staff’s central scenario, growth is
projected to continue at a moderate pace.
Mainland GDP growth is likely to ease in 2012
to 2.2 percent, reflecting global weakness,
which has caused manufacturing and
consumer confidence indicators in Norway to
recently dip. As this soft patch passes and with
the output gap nearly closed, mainland GDP
growth should plateau over the medium term
near the potential growth rate of 2¾ percent
(Table 2). This estimate for potential growth is
based on the sum of


labor productivity growth of 1.6 percent
per year—the average growth rate over
the last two decades—and



working-age population growth of 1.1
percent per year; this relatively rapid
growth is driven by high rates of net
immigration, which are expected to persist
in the medium term.

Meanwhile, the growth rate of total GDP is
expected to be about ¾ percentage points
below mainland growth over the forecast
horizon due to declining oil and gas
production.

However, this “soft landing” in the
relatively benign central scenario is subject
to large risks, as highlighted in the Risk
Assessment Matrix (Annex IV). Two of the
most notable risks are the following:
Collapse in property markets: With housing
valuations elevated, there is a significant
risk of a large price reversal, which would
depress residential investment and
dampen consumption via wealth effects.

15.
The composition of growth is
expected to gradually rebalance toward less
reliance on domestic demand. In the near
term, growth will remain domestic demandled, given (i) solid wage growth; (ii) continued
near-term momentum in the housing market;
and (iii) sluggish growth in major trading
partners. As a result, the non-oil trade deficit is
expected to deteriorate slightly. Over the
medium term, growth is projected to slowly
rebalance as macroeconomic policies gradually
tighten (see next section), housing valuations
slowly return to more normal levels, and
external demand gradually improves, resulting
in a stabilization of the non-oil trade deficit.

that households do not have a large equity
buffer in the event of a fall in house prices,
which could lead to higher default rates,
placing stress on bank balance sheets.
Overall, econometric evidence suggests
that a 10 percentage point drop in house
prices is associated with lower GDP growth
of roughly 1 percentage point in Norway
(Annex III). Banks are also vulnerable to a
correction in commercial property prices,
as lending to this sector accounts for the
bulk of corporate lending.


Intensification of eurozone crisis: Direct
trade and financial linkages to the most
vulnerable eurozone countries are limited
(Annex V). However, the deceleration in
global growth that would likely accompany
an intensification of the eurozone crisis
would significantly affect Norway’s
economy via lower non-oil exports (60
percent of which are to Europe) and
shaken consumer confidence. Severe
eurozone turmoil could also precipitate
other, interrelated risks flagged in the Risk
Assessment Matrix. For example, it would
likely heighten stress in international
interbank markets, hampering Norwegian
banks’ access to funding and possibly
leading to fire sales that threaten bank
profitability, though such liquidity stresses
could be mitigated by official liquidity
support, as during the Lehman crisis.
Severe eurozone turmoil could also affect
Norway through lower oil prices, especially

2011 ARTICLE IV REPORT

if these fall below US$70/barrel—roughly
the cost of production in Norway’s most
expensive oil fields—for an extended
period, as this would depress oil
investment.

Authorities’ views
17.
The authorities broadly share these
views on the central scenario and key risks.
The proposed government budget projects 3
percent growth for 2012, somewhat higher
than staff’s latest projection. However, the
budget’s forecast was made in early October
and thus was not able to reflect the significant
deterioration in the international growth
outlook since then.

POLICY DISCUSSIONS
A. The Policy Mix
18.
A careful policy mix will help
Norway address its multiple policy
challenges. Macroprudential tightening is
needed to reduce financial stability risks
associated with high household debt and
elevated house prices and to continue moving
to a safer financial system, in line with global
and European reforms. Structural fiscal
adjustment is also necessary to reduce
projected long-run fiscal gaps (see below).
However, macroprudential and fiscal
tightening should be sequenced carefully to
avoid re-opening a negative output gap,
especially in light of heightened global risks.
Of the two, macroprudential tightening is the

more pressing near-term priority. To help
balance this, the neutral stance envisaged in
the 2012 budget is appropriate, though fiscal
tightening should commence starting in 2013
under the central scenario. If macroprudential
and fiscal policies tighten over the medium
term, monetary policy will be able to stay loose
for longer to help ensure that output stays at
potential. Such a policy mix will also reduce
risks of excessive exchange rate appreciation
and associated competitiveness problems.
However, policies should adjust from the paths
envisaged above if shocks cause substantial
deviations from the central scenario.

B. Fiscal Policy
19.
The 2012 budget aims for a broadly
neutral stance. The budget targets a structural
deficit approximately equal to 4 percent of the
GPF-G’s capital—the target under Norway’s
fiscal guidelines. With the GPF-G’s capital
growing, the structural non-oil deficit as a
percent of trend mainland GDP will increase,
but only by 0.3 percent of mainland GDP—
implying a broadly neutral fiscal impulse. No
major discretionary policy changes are
planned.

Norway’s overall fiscal position is
currently strong. The central government is
expected to register an overall surplus of 10½
percent of trend mainland GDP in 2012. Gross
government debt will remain around 60
percent of mainland GDP while the
government’s net asset position (including the
GPF-G) will rise to 225 percent of mainland
GDP.

22.
In this context, there is a good case
for aiming to gradually spend less than 4
percent of GPF-G capital over the medium
term. The following considerations support
this approach:


With the output gap closing, some
overperformance against the 4 percent
rule will be necessary during the expansion
phase of the cycle to re-build a buffer to
use for discretionary stimulus during the
next downturn, thereby ensuring that the 4
percent target is at least met on average
over the cycle;



Real yields on long-term government
bonds in major advanced countries have
fallen sharply over the last decade,
suggesting that maintaining a 4 percent
real return on the GPF-G’s assets may be
challenging for the foreseeable future; this
implies that spending out of GPF-G assets

21.
However, the government faces
large fiscal challenges over the long run.
The GPF-G will eventually start declining as a
share of mainland GDP as new oil revenues
slow and as its real return is spent each year.
Returns on the GPF-G available for budgetary
use will thus also fall as a percent of mainland
GDP, starting in the mid-2020s. At the same
time, spending on age and disability pensions

will rise steadily as a percent of mainland GDP
due to population aging. Healthcare spending
will also rise due both to population aging and
technological change. Non-oil revenue that is
indirectly dependent on the oil sector (e.g.,
VAT on consumption out of oil-related wages
and profits) will also decline with this sector.
The net result is a substantial long-run fiscal
gap.



Given the looming long-run fiscal gap,
gradual tightening now will help smooth
the path of eventual adjustment.

23.
Further entitlement reform is also
key to reducing long-run fiscal pressures.
Options for such reform include the following:
•
Requiring employers to contribute to
longer-term sick leave benefits (currently they
contribute only for the first 16 days) to
improve their incentives to accept returning
workers and to monitor use of longer-term
sick leave, which is very high by international
standards; this would need to be offset by cuts
in employer payroll taxes or a reduction in the
days for which employers pay 100 percent of
benefits in order to keep overall employment
costs unchanged.

3

The fiscal guidelines, which have served Norway well,
call for spending only the real long-run return on the
GPF-G, whatever that return is deemed to be (i.e., the 4
percent assumption should be changed if the
expected real long-run return is deemed to have
fallen).

•
Increasing the use of social security
physicians in assessing eligibility for disability
benefits in order to promote more uniform

•
Reforming public sector pensions in
line with recent reforms of the National
Insurance Scheme in order to increase
incentives to remain in the labor force.
•
Changing the annual increase in
pensions from wage growth minus 0.75
percent to the more internationally common
practice of CPI inflation. This would yield fiscal
savings while preserving the real value of
pensions during retirement.
24.
Tax reform would also help reduce
macroeconomic vulnerabilities.


Reducing tax subsidies for owner-occupied
housing. One structural factor behind high
mortgage debt in Norway is the very
favorable tax treatment provided to
owner-occupied housing: mortgage
interest is tax-deductible, the tax on
imputed rent was abolished in 2005, and
effective rates of property taxation are
amongst the lowest in the OECD. Gradually
reducing the implicit tax subsidy for
owner-occupied housing—perhaps by
introducing a fixed nominal cap on the

NORWAY

amount of a mortgage that is eligible for
interest deduction and by bringing
property tax valuations closer to market
valuations—could free resources for
productivity-enhancing tax cuts, improve
progressivity, and bolster financial stability
by reducing risks associated with excessive
mortgage debt.


Promoting increased use of equity finance.
The corporate tax creates a bias against
equity finance and promotes excessive
leverage because interest on debt is taxdeductible while equity finance is not. This
bias could be reduced by introducing an
Allowance for Corporate Equity (ACE)—an
explicit deduction for the cost of equity
finance, as in Belgium (among other
countries) and as proposed by the IMF
Staff Discussion Note Tax Biases to Debt
Finance: Assessing the Problem, Finding
Solutions. Such a reform could improve
incentives for both financial and
nonfinancial corporates to reduce
leverage, thereby promoting financial
stability. Fiscal space for such a reform
could be created by the housing tax
reforms noted above, other reforms to

2011 ARTICLE IV REPORT

corporate and personal income taxes, or
restraint on spending growth.

Authorities’ views
25.
The authorities reiterated their
commitment to fiscal discipline and to
adhering to the fiscal guidelines. They
concurred with staff’s recommendation for a
somewhat tighter structural deficit over the
medium term to ensure that the guidelines are
met on average over the cycle, though they
considered 4 percent to remain an appropriate
estimate of the likely real return on the GPF-G
over time. The authorities acknowledged the
long-run fiscal challenges, including the need
to address high enrollment rates in sickness
and disability benefits. In this regard, they
noted that recent reforms had been
undertaken to require employers and
physicians to monitor use of sick leave benefits
earlier and more closely (Box 1). Regarding the
introduction of an ACE, the authorities
expressed concerns about possible fiscal losses
and prefer to further observe other countries’
experiences before adopting it.

C. Monetary Policy
26.
Inflation is expected to rise back to
the 2½ percent target only gradually. Solid
wage growth, the closing of the output gap,
and stabilization of exchange rate appreciation
are expected to increase inflation going
forward. On the other hand, the recent
moderation of global commodity prices should
be disinflationary. On balance, headline
inflation (currently 0.2 percent) is expected to
slowly rise to the 2½ percent target by 2013.
Consistent with this view, survey respondents
expect inflation of 2.4 percent two years hence
(Figure 5).

27.
Given this outlook, the current
monetary stance remains appropriate. The
current policy rate is broadly in line with both
calibrated and estimated Taylor rules, as
below-target inflation and a closed output gap
imply that the current policy rate should
remain below its steady state level, which is
estimated to be 4½ percent.4 Moreover, the
4

The calibrated Taylor rule uses standard coefficients
(those used by Taylor) of 1.5 on the deviation of
inflation from target and 0.5 on the output gap.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND 25

2011 ARTICLE IV REPORT

NORWAY

Box 1. Authorities’ Response to Past IMF Policy Recommendations
The authorities’ macroeconomic policies over the last
two years have been broadly in line with past Fund
advice. They have also adopted some structural
reforms recommended by the Fund at the time of the
last Article IV consultation, though deeper reform is
still needed in some areas.
Monetary and financial sector policies
Norges Bank gradually reduced monetary
stimulus during 2010 and early 2011, as
recommended by Directors at the time of the last
Article IV consultation. Given Norway’s relatively
favorable cyclical position, Norges Bank embarked
on a tightening cycle in 2009, raising the policy rate
from a low of 1¼ percent to 2¼ percent by May
2011. The pace of tightening was gradual to avoid
deflation and undermining the nascent recovery
while, at the same time, addressing macrofinancial
risks associated with high house prices and
household debt. Norges Bank appropriately eased
rates by 50 basis points in December 2011, given
heightened global risks and ECB rate cuts.
The government has made efforts to bolster
banks’ capital and liquidity buffers, though
vulnerabilities remain. Capital ratios have generally
improved over the last 2 years (Figures 9 and 10), as
the FSA continues to encourage banks to bolster
capital through retained earnings by limiting
dividends. However, progress on reducing liquidity
risks has been mixed: the average maturity of
wholesale liabilities has been lengthened, but the
financial sector-wide (banks plus mortgage
companies) deposit-to-loan ratio remains low and
falling.
The authorities have adopted targeted prudential
measures, but stronger measures are necessary.
Following the recommendations made in the 2009
Article IV consultation, the FSA introduced
guidelines in March 2010 that introduced
recommended limits on LTV and LTI ratios for
mortgages. The FSA further lowered these limits in
December 2011. However, the recommendations

26

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

are not hard caps, and the percentage of loans
exceeding these limits has actually risen since they
were initially introduced. More binding and strongly
enforced limits are thus necessary to contain risks.
Fiscal and structural policies
The authorities have reduced the structural
nonoil deficit back below the 4 percent target.
The 2009 Article IV consultation recommended that
the deficit be brought back below 4 percent of GPFG capital—the target under Norway’s fiscal
guidelines—by the end of the current parliament
(2013) in order to reverse the stimulus employed
during the recession and ensure the target is met on
average over the cycle, as called for by the
guidelines. Large positive surprises in structural
revenue in 2010 made it possible to return below the
target in 2011.
There has been some progress on
recommendations to reform sickness and
disability benefit schemes, which are critical to
contain expenditure growth in the long run. In
the summer of 2011, reforms were introduced to
enable closer monitoring of sick leave with the aim
of facilitating a more rapid return to work. These
reforms are in line with past Fund and OECD advice.
However, further efforts (as outlined in the Policy
Discussion section) are necessary to reduce the
persistently high enrollment rates in sick leave and
disability benefits.
Gradually reducing tax subsidies for housing—a
long-standing Fund recommendation—remains
challenging. Modest measures were taken in 2010
to move housing valuation assessments closer to
market values. However, the tax code still features a
strong bias toward owner-occupied housing and
accumulation of mortgage debt.

NORWAY

slight gap between the Taylor rule and the
current policy rate can be explained by the
standard Taylor rule’s failure to take into
account financial sector stress conditions,
which are currently elevated and thus justify a
policy rate slightly below the standard Taylor
rule level. Similarly, severe financial stress in
early 2009 justified some loosening relative to
the Taylor rule during this period, while the
buoyant financial conditions (i.e., low risk
aversion and easy credit conditions) during the
2004-07 boom period suggest that the policy
may have been somewhat loose during this
period after taking this factor into account.

not occur or is not sufficiently rapid to arrest
rising risks associated with elevated house
prices and household debt, monetary policy
may need to tighten. Conversely, a sharperthan-expected deterioration in external
conditions (e.g., due to intensified eurozone
turmoil) could necessitate monetary easing.

29.
The authorities agreed that
monetary policy should be the first line of
defense if risks materialize. If conditions
warrant, measures could include not only
policy rate changes, but also liquidity
measures, as during the Lehman crisis.
However, the authorities noted that monetary
policy faces a delicate task of balancing the
need to address risks associated with a
worsening global outlook against the need to
curb robust domestic credit growth. In this
regard, they concurred with staff’s
recommendation for tighter macroprudential
policy, which should allow monetary policy to
stay accommodative longer. However, they
also noted that there is much uncertainty
regarding the effectiveness of macroprudential
policies.

Norges Bank should be prepared to
respond nimbly if the outlook changes. In
particular, if macroprudential tightening does

D. Financial Sector Issues
Institutional Framework
30.
Responsibility for financial stability
and macroprudential policy is somewhat
fragmented in Norway. Norges Bank, the
Ministry of Finance, and the Financial
Supervisory Authority (FSA), which is an
independent agency reporting to the Ministry
of Finance, all produce regular assessments of
financial stability risks. Although cooperation
between these agencies was relatively good
during the 2008-09 global financial crisis,
coordination and accountability could be
enhanced by a clearer assignment of
responsibilities aligned with institutional
strengths.
31.
The Norwegian government
recognizes these issues and—like a number
of other governments—is reviewing its
institutional framework. Specifically, the
Norwegian authorities have set up a working
group that is expected to make
recommendations on a new macroprudential
framework in early 2012.
32.
Recent IMF staff analysis suggests
several guiding principles for strong
macroprudential frameworks.5 These include


promoting operational independence to
shield macroprudential policy from
political cycles, as with monetary policy;



establishing clear lines of accountability;

5
See “Towards Effective Macroprudential Policy
Frameworks: An Assessment of Stylized
Institutional Models” (IMF, Monetary and Capital
Markets Department, 2011).

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND



facilitating information-sharing across
policymaking institutions; and



bolstering the role of the central bank to
harness its macroeconomic expertise and
promote coordination with liquidity
management, payment systems oversight,
and monetary policy.

33.
A recent proposal by the Financial
Crisis Commission (FCC) achieves many of
these objectives. The FCC was set up to
review Norwegian financial sector regulation in
the aftermath of the crisis. The FCC has
recommended that Norges Bank be given the
main responsibility for assessing
macroprudential risks, given its
macroeconomic expertise. Under this proposal,
Norges Bank would have primary responsibility
for assessing macroprudential risks and
recommending changes in macroprudential
policies. The FSA would then be required to
either implement Norges Bank’s
recommendations or publicly explain why it
has chosen not to do so. This proposal does
well in promoting operational independence,
creating clear lines of accountability, and
harnessing central bank expertise. In addition,
the “comply or explain” rule provides a useful
mechanism for institutions to challenge each
other’s views. One drawback with this
approach is that the institutional separation
could inhibit information-sharing and timely
risk identification, though this concern could
be mitigated through the establishment of
appropriate fora and protocols. Proposals for
other institutional frameworks have also been
made, including giving a key role to the
Ministry of Finance. However, this approach
would be less successful in shielding
macroprudential policy from the political cycle.

NORWAY

34.
The authorities are taking steps to
reduce financial stability risks related to
high levels of household debt and house
prices. In March 2010, the Financial
Supervisory Authority (FSA) instituted new
guidelines for residential mortgage lending.
These guidelines recommended that


LTV ratios on mortgages should generally
not exceed 90 percent;



LTVs on home equity loans should
generally not exceed 75 percent; and



loan-to-income (LTI) ratios on mortgages
should generally not exceed 300 percent.

In December 2011, the FSA tightened these
guidelines further, including by lowering the
maximum LTV on mortgages to 85 percent,
lowering the maximum LTV on home equity
loans to 70 percent, and recommending that
banks allow for an interest rate increase of 5
percentage points when assessing a
borrower’s debt-service ability.
35.
These actions are welcome, but need
to be more tightly enforced to be
sufficiently effective. The LTV and LTI
maximums are not hard caps—they can be
exceeded if, for example, banks undertake a
special prudential assessment. Indeed, an FSA
survey in Autumn 2011 found that loans with
LTVs exceeding the recommended 90 percent
accounted for 38 percent of mortgages for
home purchases and 26 percent of all new
mortgages—both higher numbers than before
the FSA issued its guidelines recommending
that LTVs do not exceed 90 percent. More
binding guidelines are thus necessary to
achieve the desired reduction in high-risk
loans.

36.
Regulatory risk weights on
residential mortgages could also be raised,
as these are relatively low. One risk with such
action is that it could be undermined by
increased lending by Norwegian branches of
banks based elsewhere in the European
Economic Area (EEA), since Norwegian
regulation does not apply to these branches
under EEA rules. To prevent such regulatory

arbitrage, the Norwegian authorities may need
to seek agreement from foreign regulators to
apply Norwegian risk weights on mortgage
loans extended by foreign banks to Norwegian
households (i.e., jurisdictional reciprocity). An
alternative approach would be for all Nordic
countries to raise risk weights on mortgages in
a coordinated manner. Such cooperation
should be feasible, given that almost all major
foreign banks operating in Norway are based
in a few nearby Nordic countries. Indeed, the
recently established Nordic-Baltic Stability
Group (see below) should help facilitate such
cooperation.
37.
Continued build-up of liquidity and
capital buffers would further reduce risks.
As noted earlier, meeting the new liquidity
requirements under Basel III will be
challenging for Norwegian banks, given their

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND 29

2011 ARTICLE IV REPORT

NORWAY

dependence on short-term wholesale funding
and the limited amount of Norwegian
sovereign bonds that can serve as liquid
assets. To reduce this challenge, banks should
be encouraged to gradually extend the term of
their wholesale funding. Norwegian banks are
better positioned in regard to capital, with an
average tier 1 capital ratio over 11 percent.
Nonetheless, continued efforts to encourage
banks to restrain dividend payments and
remuneration are appropriate, given the recent
spike in global risks and ongoing risks
associated with elevated real estate prices and
high levels of private-sector debt in Norway.
38.
Progress has been made in
improving mechanisms for cross-border
resolution since the last Article IV
consultation. Norway’s financial system is
closely interlinked with neighboring countries:
the largest bank, DNB, has significant
operations in other Nordic countries while
foreign-owned banks account for about a third
of lending in Norway. Mechanisms to ensure
an orderly resolution of cross-border
institutions in the event of a crisis are thus
critical to promoting financial stability.
Significant progress toward this goal occurred
in August 2010 with the creation of the
Nordic-Baltic Stability Group, which included a
preliminary ex ante burden-sharing formula
and the establishment of a regional forum to
discuss financial stability issues. However, the
formula is not legally binding and therefore
could be re-opened in the heat of a crisis.

30

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

Authorities’ views
39.
The authorities reiterated their
commitment to financial stability, especially
in light of growing external risks. In this
regard, they agreed with staff on the need to
continue efforts to bolster capital levels,
especially for the largest Norwegian banks.
However, the authorities expressed concern
that the upcoming European Union Capital
Requirements Directive could unduly impede
flexibility with regards to exceeding Basel III
regulatory minima. The authorities also agreed
in principle on the need to tighten
macroprudential policies in the current
environment while also indicating a need to
move cautiously, given uncertainties regarding
the appropriate objectives, targets,
institutional structure, and tools for
macroprudential policies. The authorities
concurred with staff on the need to consider
increasing risk weights for mortgages in
coordination with regional partners, but noted
that the transition rules to Basel III, wherein 80
percent of Basel I limits serve as a transitional
floor and which the authorities decided on
December 20, 2011, to keep in force until
further notice, also indirectly raise the risk
weights for mortgages. They also considered
the FSA’s recent establishment and tightening
of recommended limits on LTV and LTI ratios
to be suitable tools for reducing risks
associated with high household debt.

STAFF APPRAISAL
40.
Norway’s economy continues to
perform well amidst considerable global
turbulence. Economic recovery has been
assisted by robust consumer spending,
improving terms of trade, a rebounding
housing market, and supportive policies,
including low interest rates and temporary
fiscal stimulus employed during the recession.
41.
Going forward, moderately paced
growth is expected to continue. Mainland
GDP is projected to grow by around 2¼
percent in 2012. Expansion will be mostly
propelled by domestic demand, given solid
wage growth, continued momentum in the
housing market, and sluggish growth amongst
major trading partners. The closing of the
output gap, solid wage growth, and
stabilization of exchange rate appreciation
should slowly push up inflation from its current
low rates toward the 2½ percent target over
the next two years. Over the medium term,
growth is expected to stay near its potential
rate of 2¾ percent, but gradually become
more balanced as external demand slowly
improves and as domestic demand eases due
to tighter macroeconomic policies and
eventual cooling of the housing market.
42.
This relatively benign central
scenario is subject to significant risks. One
important risk is intensified turmoil in the
eurozone. Although Norway’s economy is
better placed than many in Europe to weather
such stress, Norway would undoubtedly be
affected via shaken consumer confidence,
lower non-oil exports and oil prices, and
strains in international interbank markets. A
key domestic risk is that buoyant house prices
may eventually reverse, with adverse

consequences for consumption, residential
investment, and financial stability, especially
given very high levels of household debt.
43.
A careful policy mix will help reduce
risks while supporting growth. Tighter
macroprudential policies are needed to reduce
risks associated with high household debt and
elevated house prices. Over the medium term,
fiscal adjustment is also necessary (i) to rebuild
precautionary fiscal buffers and ensure that the
fiscal guidelines—which have served Norway
well—are met on average over the cycle and
(ii) given that the real return on the GPF-G may
well fall short of the assumed 4 percent for an
extended period. Fiscal adjustment will also
help reduce the large long-run fiscal gap.
However, macroprudential and fiscal
tightening should be sequenced carefully to
avoid excessively contractionary policy in the
near term, especially given heightened global
risks. Of the two, macroprudential tightening is
the more pressing near-term priority and
should proceed first. Fiscal tightening would
be appropriate starting in 2013 under the
central scenario. The contractionary effects
from macroprudential and medium-term fiscal
tightening can be largely offset by keeping
monetary policy looser than it would be
otherwise. Such a mix of relatively tight fiscal
and loose monetary policy will also reduce
risks of excessive exchange rate appreciation
and associated competitiveness problems.
44.
Monetary policy should be the first
line of defense if shocks cause deviations
from the central scenario. In particular, a
sharper-than-expected deterioration of
external conditions could necessitate monetary
easing. Conversely, if macroprudential

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND 31

2011 ARTICLE IV REPORT

NORWAY

tightening does not occur or is ineffective in
arresting financial stability risks, monetary
tightening may be necessary.
45.
On macroprudential tightening, a
number of specific measures could help
reduce financial stability risks. The
authorities have already taken some welcome
actions in this regard, such as the introduction
of recommended limits on LTV and LTI ratios
for mortgages. Further actions could include
making these limits more binding, with less
scope for banks to exceed them based on
subjective judgment; raising minimum risk
weights on mortgages, in coordination with
other Nordic countries to limit the scope for
cross-border regulatory arbitrage; and
reducing the degree to which the tax code
provides incentives for households and
corporations to leverage themselves. The
phasing in of these measures should be
gradual and take into account their joint effect
to avoid excessive disruptions to housing
markets.

macroprudential policy. Good guiding
principles for such a framework include to
establish clear lines of accountability; to shield
macroprudential policy from the political cycle;
to facilitate information-sharing across
policymaking institutions; and to bolster the
role of the central bank to harness its
macroeconomic expertise and promote
coordination with liquidity management,
payment systems oversight, and monetary
policy. Several institutional arrangements
could achieve these objectives, including the
one recently proposed by Norway’s FCC,
especially if mechanisms are included to
ensure robust collaboration between the FSA
and the central bank in regard to risk
identification and information sharing.

46.
Ongoing efforts to bolster capital
and liquidity buffers are also welcome.
Although capital ratios have strengthened in
recent years, some banks (especially large
banks) need to build further capital to ensure
that Basel III core tier 1 equity requirements
are safely met, given heightened risks both
domestically and abroad. The encouragement
of banks to achieve these goals via restraint of
dividends and remuneration is thus welcome.
It will also be important to lower liquidity
risks—which remain an important
vulnerability—by reducing banks’ reliance on
short-term wholesale funding.

48.
Recent progress on entitlement
reform is welcome, but further efforts are
needed to address Norway’s long-run fiscal
challenges. With oil revenue expected to
decline and pension and healthcare spending
rising, Norway faces a large long-run fiscal
gap. To address it, it will be crucial to build
broad public consensus for further entitlement
reforms aimed at reducing costs, increasing
efficiency, and bolstering employment, while
maintaining a strong safety net for those in
need. In this regard, recent reforms to enhance
monitoring of sick leave benefits are welcome.
However, further entitlement reforms are
needed to reduce the growth of spending on
sick leave and disability benefits, for which
enrollment rates are very high by international
standards; improve incentives for longer
working lives in public-service old-age pension
schemes; and contain the growth of old-age
pensions by indexing them to CPI inflation.

47.
Financial stability may further
benefit from establishing a more formal
framework for countercyclical

49.
It is recommended that the next
Article IV consultation with Norway be held
on the usual 24-month cycle.

2011 ARTICLE IV REPORT

ANNEX I. ESTIMATING THE SIZE OF NORWAY’S OUTPUT GAP
Norway experienced a relatively mild
recession during the recent global financial
crisis, suggesting minimal impact on
potential output. Substantial macroeconomic
stimulus, high public sector employment, and
limited dependence on the hardest-hit
segments of global manufacturing resulted in
a relatively shallow recession compared to its
regional peers. The quick rebound in output,
along with low unemployment, suggests that
the output gap has narrowed substantially.
This annex estimates the size of Norway’s
output gap. Given the uncertainty associated
with any individual approach to estimating the
output gap, several approaches are
considered. These approaches range from
methods that focus only on one key
macroeconomic variable, such as output or
unemployment, to methods that consider the
behavior of a variety of indicators
simultaneously.
All approaches point to an output gap that
has nearly closed. The average across all
measures indicates that the output gap
reached a trough of -1¼ percent in the second
quarter of 2010 and has since returned very
close to zero. There is surprisingly little
variation across the estimates towards the end
of the sample, though there are substantial
differences regarding the gap during the
recession. Several of the measures point to a
substantial boom in the period leading up to
the recent recession, which could potentially
be related to the surge in net immigration
during this period, as discussed later in this
annex.

A. Hodrick-Prescott Filter Approach
The Hodrick-Prescott (HP) filter is a
commonly used approach to estimate
output gaps. The HP filter estimates trend
output by minimizing the variation of the
cyclical component of output, while attaching
a penalty for making the growth rate of trend
output too volatile.1 The filter is
computationally easy to implement and serves
as a good first approximation to decomposing
output into its trend and cyclical components.
However, the approach is not without
shortcomings. In particular, the approach does
not incorporate information from other
macroeconomic variables, such as inflation or
unemployment, which may be informative
regarding the size of the output gap.
Furthermore, the filter runs into estimation
issues at the end-points of samples due to the
two-sided nature of the filter.2
1

The penalty is governed by a single parameter, . In
the exercise carried out in this annex,  is set equal to
1600.

2

End-point problems are mitigated somewhat in this
annex by adding output forecasts to the end of the
sample.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND 39

2011 ARTICLE IV REPORT

NORWAY

The HP-filter approach estimates Norway’s
output gap to be about zero as of 2011Q2.
The output gap during the recent recession is
estimated to be smaller than that experienced
during the previous recession in the early
2000s. The filter also marks the period leading
up to the recent recession as being associated
with a substantial cyclical boom, a point which
will be addressed later in this annex.

B. Estimating the output gap using
Okun’s law
While the HP filter estimates the output
gap using solely data on output, Okun’s law
yields additional insight by looking instead
at the unemployment rate. Okun’s law is a
statistical relationship between unemployment
and output that has received strong empirical
support for a broad cross-section of countries
(see Knotek, 2007; Moosa, 1997; and Okun,
1962). One formulation of Okun’s law is as
follows:
(U-U*) = β(Y-Y*)
where U is the unemployment rate, Y is output,
and U* and Y* are measures of the steadystate levels of unemployment and output,
respectively. The equation above thus relates
the size of the “unemployment gap”—the
distance between the unemployment rate and

40

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

its steady-state level—to the size of the output
gap. Estimates of the coefficient β are typically
negative, indicating that positive
unemployment gaps are associated with
negative output gaps.
One difficulty in employing Okun’s law is
estimating the steady-state level of
unemployment, U*. In the exercise carried out
in this annex, two estimates of U* are used.
The first is the average unemployment rate
over the last 15 years, which covers two
business cycles in the post-crisis period. The
idea behind this measure is that, while
unemployment is typically high during
recessions and low during expansions, on
average, it should be equal to its steady-state
level. This approach yields a U* of 3.5 percent.
The second measure of U* uses the OECD’s
estimate of the NAIRU for Norway. The
advantage of this measure relative to the first
is that it allows the steady-state
unemployment rate to change over time. The
coefficient β is estimated using a dynamic
specification of Okun’s law similar to that used
in Balakrishnan, Das, and Kannan (2010).
Estimates of the output gap based on
Okun’s law indicate that the output gap was
slightly positive in 2011Q2. Given that the
unemployment rate only increased slightly
during the past recession, the Okun’s law
estimates show the output gap reaching a
trough of only -1 percent during the recession
compared to a gap of more than -2 percent
based on the HP filter approach. The level of
output is estimated to be ½ percent above
trend as at 2011Q2. Like the HP-filter
approach, the Okun’s law estimates point to a
substantial boom in the run-up to the last
recession.

as of 2011Q2. While the Okun’s law
relationship embedded in the model places
upward pressure on the estimate of the output
gap (as was shown in the last section), the low
inflation rate points instead to a negative
output gap.

C. Multivariate Filter Approach
To complement the two approaches above,
the output gap is also estimated using a
multivariate filter on a small
macroeconomic model. The model is built
around three “gaps”: an output gap, an
unemployment gap, and a capacity utilization
gap. These gaps are pinned down by three
identifying relationships: a Phillips-curve
relationship that relates the output gap to
inflation; a dynamic version of the Okun’s law
relationship shown in the previous section; and
a capacity utilization equation that links
capacity utilization rates to the output gap.
These identifying equations are supplemented
by laws of motion for the equilibrium values of
the variables (see Appendix for further details).
Bayesian methods are used to estimate the
model while a multivariate Kalman filter is
applied to obtain the paths for the equilibrium
values of the variables. Details on the variables
used, as well as the values chosen for some
key priors, are described in the Appendix.
The multivariate-filter approach yields
output gap estimates that are similar to
that obtained using the HP filter. In
particular, both approaches point to a
significant boom prior to the recent recession
and to an output gap that is essentially closed

D. Production Function Approach
The final approach used to measure the
output gap is based on an aggregate
production function that estimates the
productive capacity of the economy. The
production function that is typically used is a
two-factor Cobb-Douglas production function.
Apart from capital and labor, the production
function also includes a measure of total factor
productivity (TFP), which measures the
efficiency with which existing inputs can be
converted to output. In practice, TFP is
calculated as a residual determinant of output
that is not explained by labor and capital. As
such, any mis-measurement or omission of
inputs will also be captured by this variable.
Another issue with this approach is that the
estimation relies on the total capital stock, not
the flow of services actually provided by the
stock at any point in time. In reality, however,
capacity utilization varies considerably over the
business cycle. Any changes in the flow of
capital services due to changes in demand
conditions are thus captured by the TFP

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND 41

2011 ARTICLE IV REPORT

NORWAY

residual. To better control for the effect of
varying capacity utilization, a modified version
of the production function is used:

ln(Y )    ln( P  PR  (1  u )  H )
 (1   )  ln(cu  K )  
where Y is output, P is the working age
population, PR is labor participation rate, u is
the unemployment rate, H is the number of
hours worked per working, cu is the capacity
utilization rate, K is the capital stock, and ε is
the estimated TFP. The parameter  is the
average labor share over the sample period,
which is assumed to be 55 percent for Norway.
Accounting for varying capacity utilization,
the production function approach indicates
that the output gap was -0.4 percent in
2011Q2. The negative output gap is primarily
due to a less-than-full utilization of the
existing stock of labor. In particular, labor force
participation rates continue to remain below
trend. Total hours are also estimated to be
below trend, though the gap has been
shrinking of late. Meanwhile, the capacity
utilization rate has been increasing since 2009,
but still remains below the pre-recession
average.

E. Impact of immigration on
potential output
In the last decade, Norway has experienced
a surge in net immigration, which could
affect estimates of potential output and the
output gap. The arrival of immigrants has
boosted the labor force, thereby increasing
potential output in Norway.

Of the approaches used to estimate the
output gap, only the production function
approach directly takes changes in the size
of the labor force into account. This may
help explain why the production function
approach (taking into account the variation in
capacity utilization) does not show a large
positive output gap in the run-up to the recent
recession.

F. Appendix3
This appendix briefly summarizes the key
features of the model. A more detailed
description is provided in Benes et al. (2010).
The model is built around three gaps—the
output gap (y), the unemployment gap (u), and
the capacity utilization gap (c)—and three
identifying equations:
The inflation equation relates the level and the
change of the output gap to core inflation:

 t   t 1  yt   yt  yt 1    t
The dynamic Okun’s law defines the
relationship between the current
unemployment rate and the output gap. Based
on Okun’s law, an unemployment equation
links the unemployment gap to the output
gap:

u t  1ut 1  2 yt   tu

Finally, the model also relies on a capacity
utilization equation, on the assumption that
capacity utilization contains important
information that can help improve the
potential output and output gap estimates.
The equation takes the following form:

ct  1ct 1   2 yt   tc
Given the three identifying equations, the
equilibrium variables are assumed to evolve
dynamically as follows. A stochastic process
including transitory (level) shocks and more
persistent shocks guides the evolution of
equilibrium unemployment, U (the NAIRU
equation):

U t  U t 1  GtU   / 100 yt 1

And potential output (Yt) is modeled to be a
function of the underlying trend growth rate of

 GtY / 4   tY
where θ is the labor share in a Cobb-Douglas
production function. This specification allows
for short- and medium-term growth of
potential to differ from trend growth. Note
that GtY is not constant, but follows serially
correlated deviations (long waves) from the
steady-state growth rate GSSY. Similar dynamic
equations are specified for equilibrium
capacity utilization.
The full model is estimated by regularized
maximum likelihood, a Bayesian methodology.
This method requires the user to define prior
distributions of the parameters. While this can
improve the estimation procedure by
preventing parameters from wandering into
nonsensical regions, the choice of priors has
also non-negligible implications for the final
estimates as the data are uninformative about
some parameters.
In addition to the prior distributions of
parameters, the analyst has to provide values
for θ and the steady-state (long-run)
unemployment rate (USS) and potential GDP
growth rates (GSSY ), which were set to 0.55, 4

percent, and 2.7 percent, respectively. While
values especially for USS and GSSY matter
conceptually, as the (endogenous) estimates
converge to these (exogenously given) values
in the long term, from a practical point of view,
the dynamics over the time horizon of interest
are relatively little affected by the choice of the
steady-state values.

ANNEX II. DOES NORWAY HAVE A COMPETITIVENESS PROBLEM?
Strong wage growth has resulted in an
appreciation of Norway’s ULC-based real
effective exchange rate (REER), raising
concerns about competitiveness. Norway’s
ULC-based REER appreciated by 35 percent
over the last decade, leaving it significantly
above its 30-year average. The higher cost of
producing goods raises concerns of Dutch
Disease effects, wherein higher incomes
brought about by the resource boom place
upward pressure on the price of nontradables,
thus threatening the competitiveness of nonoil tradeables.

However, Norway’s non-oil exports have
maintained a relatively constant market
share over the last decade. Norway’s stable
share of global non-oil exports is particularly
striking when compared to the trend decline in
the share of advanced economies in overall
world trade due to the rise of emerging market
economies. The ratio of non-oil exports to GDP
in Norway has also remained constant over the
past decade at roughly 30 percent.

Market shares have held up across a broad
range of products, with a particularly
strong performance of the Norwegian fish
industry. Exports of fish—Norway’s largest
non-oil export—have been especially robust
over the past few years, with global market
shares increasing following the collapse in
Chilean salmon production in 2007–09.
However, gains in market share have also been
experienced in the chemical materials,
industrial equipment, and scientific instrument
industries. Still, there have been a fair number
of industries that have seen falling market
shares over the past decade, though the
magnitudes have not been particularly
alarming, especially in the context of the
general decline in the share of advanced
economies’ exports in world trade.

starkest form, the theory of purchasing power
parity states that a bundle of goods measured
in the same currency should cost the same
across countries. Differences in productivity
and factor endowments, however, can lead to
higher price levels for countries that have
higher income levels. Even after accounting for
this effect, Norway’s price level vis-à-vis the
U.S. is 46 percent higher than what would be
implied by the empirical fit of the relationship
between relative price levels and income per
capita.

Norway’s exports have been supported by
strong global demand, as reflected in the
increase of its non-oil terms of trade. The
improvement in the terms of trade and the
preservation of market shares in the face of
increasing domestic costs point to an increase
in external demand for Norway’s exports.
Much of this increase comes from emerging
economies in East Asia, which have also
contributed to the improvement in Norway’s
terms of trade through lower import prices.

The ES methodology for oil-exporting
countries instead pins down the current
account norm by imposing a preferred path of
consumption of the revenues from oil and gas
extraction. Under a rule that ensures constant
per capita real consumption of oil revenues,
the implied overvaluation is 11.6 percent.

The exchange rate assessment based on the
external sustainability approach is sensitive
to the desired path of consumption of oil
revenues. A first option is to keep a constant
real consumption level of oil revenues that
implies a current account norm of 11.3 percent
and a mild 6 percent overvaluation. Given the
projected population growth, a somewhat
higher current account surplus is required if
Norway wants to maintain a constant per

The ES results are also significantly affected
by assumptions on the real interest rate and
size of oil reserves. Consistent with the fiscal
rule, the calculations presented above are
based on a 4 percent real return on foreign
assets. A reduction in the rate of return by one
percentage point would increase the
overvaluation assessment by about 7 percent.
Conversely, new oil and gas discoveries would
allow for more spending and bring the
exchange rate closer to equilibrium. For every
1 billion increase in standard cubic meters of
oil equivalent, the assessed overvaluation
would be reduced by about 3.5 percent.

ANNEX III. HOUSE PRICES IN NORWAY
Norwegian house prices are in the midst of
a long boom. As in many other OECD
countries, house prices in Norway grew rapidly
between the mid-1990s and late 2000s, before
dipping during the global financial crisis.
Unlike elsewhere, however, house prices in
Norway quickly resumed their upward trend in
2010. Indeed, over the last two years Norway
has seen one of the most rapid paces of real
house price appreciation in the OECD.

Solid income growth explains only part of
this boom: the house price-to-income ratio
has also been rising. This ratio is now 28

The boom has been broad-based. While
there has been some variation in the boom
within Norway—for example, with higher price
appreciation in Stavanger, where the oilrelated boom is most prevalent—house prices
in most major cities have grown broadly in line
with the national average. This suggests that
the boom is driven largely by common
national factors.

This annex examines the main factors
behind this house price boom, as well as
consequences of a possible price reversal.
The annex finds that, while fundamentals
explain part of the boom, signs also point to
risks of overvaluation. A house price bust
would likely be associated with depressed
economic activity and increased financial
sector stress, especially given high levels of
mortgage debt.

2011 ARTICLE IV REPORT

A. Factors Behind the Boom

Supply constraints are a contributing factor
to the boom. Real house price growth has
persistently exceeded the growth of
construction costs over the last decade. This
indicates that land availability and/or
regulatory constraints may limit the degree to
which housing supply can respond quickly and
elastically to rising demand.

Indicators suggest that housing supply has
indeed lagged demand from population
growth, though this gap does not appear
large. Over the last decade, Norway has
experienced solid population growth, in part
due to robust net immigration. As a result, the
total increase in households since 2001 has
exceeded the increase in dwellings, but only
slightly. Moreover, the growth of dwellings
exceeded the growth of households during
2002-2007 when prices grew most rapidly.

The sharp rise in the price-to-rent ratio also
indicates that much of the boom reflects
other factors. If house price appreciation were
purely due to a fundamental mismatch
between population growth and housing
supply, one would expect rents, which are
relatively liberalized in Norway, to also be
rising rapidly. Instead, the ratio of house prices
to rents has risen sharply during the boom and
is now nearly 70 percent above its historical
average—the highest such deviation in any
OECD country. This indicates that factors other
than the mismatch between population
growth and housing supply—such as lower
interest rates, looser credit conditions, and/or
changes in investor sentiment and taxation—
are needed to explain the large increase in the
demand for owner-occupied housing relative
to rental units.

Lower interest rates have allowed
households to carry greater debt. Mortgages
rose from 30 percent of GDP in 2000 to 60
percent in 2010. Meanwhile, total household
mortgage debt as a fraction of disposable
income has increased to 195 percent by end2010, considerably higher than the previous
peak in 1990. Norges Bank estimates that this
ratio will continue to rise over the next four
years.

However, lower interest rates do not
explain the full story. Lower real interest rates
lower the user cost of owner-occupied housing
and hence could explain the rise in Norway’s
price-to-rent ratio. However, lower interest
rates do not explain why Norway’s ratio has
risen so much faster than in other countries, as
interest rates in many other countries have
fallen by as much or more than in Norway over
the last decade.
Another candidate for explaining the boom
is loose credit conditions. Loan-to-value
(LTV) ratios are somewhat high in Norway: as
of Autumn 2011, 38 percent of mortgages for
home purchase and 26 percent of all new
mortgages (including refinancing) have LTVs
exceeding 90 percent. It is difficult to know
how much these credit conditions account for
the boom, since the share of mortgages with
LTVs over 90 percent has been high since data
were first collected in the late 1990s, after the
boom was already underway. However, it is
somewhat worrisome that the share of
mortgages with LTVs over 90 percent has
increased since 2010, despite the issuance of
FSA guidelines recommending against

NORWAY

allowing LTVs to exceed this level, other than
in exceptional circumstances.

Expectations of Price Increases
Expectations of increasing prices may lead
agents to buy for speculative motives.
Optimistic expectations may cause house
prices to deviate from long-run trends,
especially if the supply of housing is inelastic in
the short run.

A considerable increase in mortgage
origination comes also from the role played
by non-bank mortgage lenders. In recent
years, Norwegian banks’ funding has changed.
Market funding has assumed a more
important role, especially since 2007 when new
legislation on covered bonds allowed
specialized mortgage credit institutions to
raise loans by issuing covered bonds. Covered
bonds (backed by high-quality mortgages)
have enabled credit institutions to borrow on
more favorable terms. As a result, the volume
of secured loans issued by mortgage
companies has picked up considerably since
2008. In 2011, loans from mortgage companies
represented nearly 50 percent of new
mortgages.

Survey data indicate that expectations of
future house price increases may indeed
play a role in the current boom. According
to a recent FSA survey, an increasing number
of households believe that property prices will
continue to appreciate. The percent of
households expecting high house price
appreciation was as low as 10 percent in 2008.
Today, 70 percent of the survey respondents
expect prices to increase over the next 12
months.

Taxation
Owner-occupied housing receives quite
generous tax treatment in Norway:


Income tax on imputed rents (the rental
services that owners receive from the
house they live in) was abolished in 2005,
whereas rents paid on rental units continue
to be taxed as income. This discrepancy
creates a large implicit tax subsidy for
owner-occupied housing, which
disproportionately benefits high-income
households and creates excessive demand
for such housing relative to its social costs.



In some countries, this distortion is offset
by limiting the tax deductibility of
mortgage interest payments, but in
Norway mortgage interest payments are
fully tax-deductible.



Property taxes in Norway are also relatively
low (1.2 percent of GDP in 2008 against 1.8
percent of GDP in the average OECD
country), in part because valuations of
dwellings for wealth tax purposes are only
about a quarter of their true market value.
In contrast, both financial assets and
financial debts (including mortgages) are
valued at their true value for wealth tax
purposes, which is a tax on net wealth. This

52

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

This generous tax treatment may have
contributed to the boom in several ways:


The abolition of the tax on imputed rents
in 2005 likely increased substantially the
demand for housing. Although the
authorities have made efforts in recent
years to reduce the implicit tax subsidies
for owner-occupied housing—including by
taking steps in 2010 to raise property
valuations for tax purposes—these
changes are likely swamped by the 2005
change in terms of magnitude.



Though not an original cause of the boom,
the tax system’s promotion of high
household leverage—due to the
deductibility of mortgage interest and the
asymmetric valuation of housing assets
and mortgages for wealth tax purposes—
may have amplified the effect of the boom
on household balance sheets.

Summing up
Overall, fundamentals appear to explain
part, but not all, of the house price boom in
Norway. In particular, fundamentals such as
higher income, population growth, and tax

NORWAY

changes have all boosted demand. Additional
pressures on prices have come from the slow
adjustment of supply. However, nonfundamental factors such as optimistic price
expectations—which are unlikely to be
sustainable and could change quickly—have
also played a role. Low interest rates and
favorable financing conditions may also not be

2011 ARTICLE IV REPORT

sustainable indefinitely. On balance, modelbased estimates from the IMF’s Early Warning
Exercise (EWE), which take into account the key
determinants of house prices, suggest that
Norwegian residential property prices may be
misaligned by 15-20 percent. However, there is
admittedly a high amount of uncertainty
around this estimate in both directions.

B. Consequences of a House Price Decline: How Vulnerable is Norway?
Regardless of whether housing prices are
fundamentally sound or not, there are
concerns that the housing boom and
households’ growing indebtedness make the
Norwegian economy vulnerable to an interest
rates hike, slowing income growth, or a house
price burst.
Experience shows that once a housing
boom develops, fueled by a sustained
expansion in credit, a brisk correction may
have major consequences. The Nordic crisis
of the early 1990s and the recent 2007-09
global crisis are just two examples of how
changes in property prices generate major
disruptions to both the financial sector and the
economy as a whole. During the boom,
homeowners borrow heavily against the rise in
home equity, reduce saving rates, and increase
consumption. During the bust, the house price
decline—in combination with high household
debt levels—has a serious drag on the
economy. There are three main channels
through which the housing market affects the
real economy: residential investment, private
consumption, and the financial sector.

Housing construction is also a labor

markets may thus entail a large reallocation of
labor, with first-order effects on employment.

Private Consumption
Private consumption is affected by the
housing market through wealth and
liquidity effects. A decline in house prices
weakens aggregate consumption through a
negative wealth effect. Falling prices also
impair homeowners’ ability to borrow, and
hence to consume, if housing is used as
collateral to finance consumption. In Norway,
there is a strong correlation between private
consumption and house prices.

Financial Sector
The financial sector is highly exposed to the
housing market. When house prices decline,
households’ equity also declines, impairing
their debt-servicing capacity. Lower house
prices also increase banks’ loss-given-default
in the event of foreclosure. Such effects on
banks’ balance sheets could be significant, as
mortgages account for 40 percent of banks’
assets (including mortgage companies). This in
turn could lead to a vicious circle of tighter
credit and further drops in housing demand
and prices, economic growth, and
employment.
Loan losses on household lending rose
significantly during the last house price
bust in early 1990s. At that time, the NPL

54

ratio on household lending reached 10
percent. Though not as high as levels reached
during crises in some countries, such losses
could nonetheless seriously weaken banks’

In addition, there is no guarantee that loan
losses would not exceed this level in the
future. Mortgages are full recourse in Norway,
giving households a strong incentive to avoid
default. However, this is mitigated somewhat
by the Debt Settlement Act introduced in the
early 90s, which gives persons with serious
debt problems an opportunity to regain
control of their financial affairs. More
generally, the historically high levels of
household debt, the large fraction of loans
with high LTVs, the predominance of mortgage
loans with adjustable interest rates, and the
high percentage of financial assets held in
illiquid forms (e.g., insurance reserves account
for over a third of gross financial wealth) all
suggest that households’ balance sheets are
vulnerable to adverse shocks.

Lower consumption due to a house price
bust would also adversely affect the
financial sector indirectly. During the early
1990s house price bust, households cut back
sharply on consumption to avoid default. This
lower demand in turn caused commercial real
estate and other loans to businesses to go
bad, contributing to the financial crisis. In this
way, high household debt and falling house
prices were an important factor behind the
crisis. Given past experience, this indirect effect
may again be a key channel through which a
house price bust would affect the financial
sector.

2011 ARTICLE IV REPORT

with a larger real and financial exposure to the
housing sector. In the regression, country and
year fixed effects are also included to control
for unobserved country-specific and timevarying factors common to all countries. The
table below reports the results for a sample of
20 OECD countries during the period 19802011.
The estimates suggest that a 10 per cent
drop in real house prices in Norway is
associated with roughly 1 percentage point
lower GDP growth than otherwise. This
effect is comparable in magnitude to that for
the average country in the sample, and it
suggests the Norwegian economy is not better
insulated than other countries from variations
in the housing market, as reduced vulnerability
from Norway’s relatively small residential
investment sector is offset by higher
vulnerability from the high levels of mortgage
debt. 1 A correction of 30 percent in house
prices—as occurred during the crisis in the
90s—would exert a non-negligible effect to
the real economy. Although these estimates
do not establish a causal link, they do provide
correlations for the typical association between
house prices and GDP growth.

Econometric evidence
Econometric estimates can help quantify
the aggregate effect of house prices on
GDP growth. Vulnerability to real estate price
developments is assessed through a panel
regression model (see text table below). For
each country, real GDP growth is modeled as a
function of the change in real house prices and
its interaction with two country-specific
variables: the ratio of residential investment to
GDP and the ratio of mortgage debt to GDP.
Underlying this specification is the assumption
that changes in residential property prices
have more pronounced effects in countries

1

At the end of 2009 (the last available data point for
Norway), the residential investment to GDP ratio is 3
percent and the mortgage debt to GDP ratio is 70
percent. For the mean country in the sample, the same
ratios are 5 and 40 percent, respectively.

ANNEX V. EXPOSURE TO THE EUROZONE AND OTHER INTERNATIONAL LINKAGES
Like other Scandinavian countries, Norway
is considerably integrated internationally.
In 2010, Norway’s gross exports exceeded 40
percent of GDP (oil and natural gas constituted
64 percent of these), and imports were around
25 percent of GDP. Norway is also highly
interconnected financially, with gross foreign
assets and liabilities equal to 284 and 186
percent of GDP, respectively.

Norwegian exporters are unlikely to be
heavily affected by further eurozone
turmoil as long as it is limited mainly to the
periphery. Oil and gas exports are imported
mainly by non-euro countries (Denmark, UK,
and Sweden) or by core eurozone countries,
and oil could anyway be reallocated on the
international market. Regarding the exposure
through non-fuel goods, the export share to
Greece, Ireland, and Portugal is only 2 percent.
Italy and Spain account also for a moderate
share, equal to 4 percent. However, more
generalized distress leading to a broad-based
global downturn would undoubtedly depress
global oil prices as well as demand for
Norway’s non-oil exports.

Regarding international financial linkages,
foreign assets are primarily invested in
securities and are largely owned by the
Government Pension Fund—Global (GPF-G).
Portfolio investment in equity and fixedincome securities accounts for 62 percent of
gross foreign assets. The large majority of
these securities are held within the GPF-G,
which can only invest abroad in publicly traded
stocks, fixed-income securities, and in real
estate but only up to 5 percent of the total
portfolio.

Foreign investment is largely concentrated
in Europe, but the banking sector’s
exposure to the eurozone periphery is very
limited. More than half of Norway’s foreign
securities are issued by European countries,
with the GPF-G having an explicit mandate to
invest between 50 and 60 percent of its
portfolio in the region. Banks’ exposure to
distressed eurozone countries is, however, very
limited, with DNB (the largest Norwegian bank
and the only one included in the European
Banking Authority stress tests) holding no
sovereign bonds of Greece, Ireland, Portugal,
Belgium, Italy, or Spain.

The most significant exposure to
international risks derives from banks’
reliance on foreign wholesale funds.
Norwegian banks finance almost 20 percent of
their assets with short-term foreign wholesale
funds, thereby heavily exposing banks to
international financial conditions. The NIBOR
spread (the difference between Norway’s
interbank rate and treasury bills) is indeed
highly correlated with the TED spreads that
captures funding tensions in the US market.
Econometric analysis suggests that a 1
standard deviation shock to an index of
European financial stress reduces Norway’s
mainland GDP growth by 0.5 percentage
points after three quarters (2009 Norway

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

International Monetary Fund
700 19th Street, NW
Washington, D. C. 20431 USA

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2011 Article IV Consultation with Norway
On January 27, 2012, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded
the Article IV consultation with Norway. 1
Background
Norway’s economy has performed well amidst considerable global turbulence. Over the last two
years, mainland GDP has grown steadily at an annual pace of 2-3 percent, supported by robust
growth in consumer spending, a rebounding housing market, and favorable terms of trade
developments. Output has now surpassed its pre-recession levels, and unemployment remains
low at around 3¼ percent. This solid recovery has been aided by supportive policies, including
low interest rates (the policy rate is currently 1¾ percent) and temporary fiscal stimulus
employed during the recession. Financial sector performance has generally picked up along
with economic activity over the last two years, with credit growing solidly and capital ratios
increasing. However, progress on reducing liquidity risks has been mixed: the average maturity
of wholesale liabilities has been lengthened, but the sector-wide deposit-to-loan ratio remains
somewhat low and falling.
Going forward, moderately paced growth is expected to continue. Mainland GDP is projected to
grow by around 2¼ percent in 2012. Expansion will be mostly propelled by domestic demand,
given solid wage growth, continued near-term momentum in the housing market, and sluggish
Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On
return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the
Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the
Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the
country's authorities. An explanation of any qualifiers used in summings up can be found here:

growth amongst major trading partners. The closing of the output gap, along with upward
pressure on prices from solid wage growth, should slowly push up inflation from its current low
rates (which partly reflect past krone appreciation) toward the 2½ percent target over the next
two years. Over the medium term, growth is expected to stay near its potential rate of 2¾
percent, but gradually become more balanced as external demand slowly improves and as
domestic demand eases due to tighter macroeconomic policies and eventual cooling of the
housing market.
However, this relatively benign central scenario is subject to significant risks. One important risk
is the possibility of intensified turmoil in the eurozone. Although Norway’s economy is better
placed than many in Europe to weather such turmoil—given its low sovereign risk and the
limited direct exposure of Norway’s banks to the most vulnerable eurozone countries—severe
stress would undoubtedly affect Norway via shaken consumer confidence, lower oil prices and
non-oil exports, and strains in international interbank markets, which are an important funding
source for Norway’s largest banks. A key domestic risk is that buoyant house prices (Norway
currently has the highest house price-to-rent ratio relative to its historical average amongst all
OECD economies) may eventually reverse, with adverse consequences for consumption,
residential investment, and financial stability, especially given very high levels of household
debt.
Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors welcomed Norway’s steady economic recovery, which has benefited from
supportive policies. The challenge going forward will be to continue stable growth in the face of
a difficult near-term global outlook while at the same time reducing vulnerabilities arising from
long-run fiscal pressures and high levels of household debt and house prices.
To address the latter risks, Directors agreed on the need to tighten macroprudential policies.
They welcomed efforts to tighten standards for mortgage lending, including through the use of
recommended limits on loan-to-value and loan-to-income ratios. Further actions to reduce
financial stability risks could include making these limits more binding; raising minimum risk
weights on mortgages, in coordination with other Nordic countries to limit the scope for
cross-border regulatory arbitrage; and reducing the degree to which the tax code provides
incentives for households and corporations to leverage themselves. Banks should be
encouraged to bolster their capital and liquidity buffers, including by exercising restraint on
dividends and remuneration, and reducing reliance on short-term foreign wholesale funding.
Directors also called for close monitoring of mortgage companies, which rely heavily on covered
bond financing.
Directors welcomed the ongoing work on strengthening the institutional framework for
macroprudential policy, with an enhanced role for the central bank. Issues to be addressed
would include the coordination of macroprudential policy with liquidity management, payment

3
systems oversight, and monetary policy; the adoption of a framework that encourages
information-sharing across policymaking bodies, while fitting the national context; and the
establishment of clear lines of responsibility.
Directors supported the broadly neutral fiscal stance in the short term. Provided that growth
strengthens, fiscal tightening would be appropriate over the medium term to rebuild
precautionary fiscal buffers and ensure that the fiscal guidelines are met on average over the
cycle. It would also help reduce the long-run fiscal gap stemming from rising healthcare and
pension costs and declining oil revenue. Directors welcomed the progress on entitlement
reform. They encouraged the authorities to build broad public consensus for further reforms
aimed at reducing costs, increasing efficiency, and bolstering employment, while maintaining a
strong safety net for those in need.
Directors noted that the contractionary effects from macroprudential and medium-term fiscal
tightening can be largely offset by keeping monetary policy looser than it would be otherwise.
Such a policy mix will also reduce risks of excessive exchange rate appreciation and associated
competitiveness problems. In this context, Directors generally agreed that the current monetary
policy stance is appropriate and that monetary policy should be the first line of defense to
address downside risks. A number of Directors observed that Norway also has room to delay
fiscal tightening should large external risks materialize.

Statement by Mr. Audun Gronn,
Alternate Executive Director for Norway
January, 27, 2012
On behalf of my Norwegian authorities, I would like to thank staff for a very well-written
report on the Norwegian economy. My authorities broadly agree with staff’s findings and
analysis in the report, and welcome the recommendations.
Economic development and main economic challenges
The description of current economic developments and the outlook for the domestic
economy are mainly in accordance with the views of my authorities. The prospects for a
balanced development in the Norwegian economy over the medium term are indeed
good, but, as staff also notes, there are risk factors present.
The main challenge is the risk related to the competitive situation for manufacturing and
other exposed sectors in the economy. There are signs of a dual development within these
sectors. Firms providing goods and services to the oil sector 1 experience strong demand
due to high oil investments, while other parts of the exposed sector suffer from weak
external demand. High wage cost levels and a strong krone exchange rate constitute a
threat to balanced development in the years to come. These challenges will become even
more pronounced a few years from now when oil investments are expected to decline.
Another challenge is linked to high house prices. This is well described in the staff report.
House prices have steadily increased over the last two decades, only interrupted by a
slight decline starting in mid 2007 and ending in late 2008. The risk of elevated house
prices stresses the need to pursue macro prudential measures and regulations on credit
practice in banks.
Fiscal policy
The Norwegian fiscal framework supports a stable development of the mainland
economy and reduces the risk of “Dutch disease” by keeping spending of oil revenues on
a sustainable path. Furthermore, the framework ensures that also future generations will
benefit from the oil wealth. The Government’s net cash flow from oil activities is set
aside in The Government Pension Fund Global and invested abroad. Oil income is phased
into the economy on par with the expected real return from the Government Pension
Fund Global, estimated at four percent.
This framework has worked well and has broad political support in the parliament.
However, a large Pension fund generates constant pressure from various interest groups
to spend more than what follows from the established guidelines. My authorities would
like to highlight the importance of adhering to the Norwegian comprehensive fiscal
framework.

The term “oil” in this statement refers to both oil and gas.

Staff recommends in the report that fiscal policy should be tightened over the medium
term. My authorities take note of this advice, but would like to emphasize that the present
fiscal guidelines already ensure a careful and gradual phasing in of oil revenues in the
Norwegian economy. Due to the gradually increasing size of the Pension Fund Global,
the calculated four per cent return of the fund increases as well. Based on present
estimates, the fiscal guidelines give room for an annual increase in spending of oil
revenues in the magnitude of ¼ per cent of GDP of Mainland-Norway over the medium
term. This implies that an expansionary fiscal impulse of the same size will be in line
with the fiscal framework for Norway, and, also, that staff’s advice to keep spending of
oil revenue somewhat below the four per cent path may be consistent with a slightly
expansionary or a neutral fiscal stance.
In 2011, spending of oil revenue came in well below the 4 per cent target. The projection
for 2012 is also below. In 2009 and 2010, spending ended above the target, mainly as a
result of the effects of the financial crisis. These examples confirm the purpose and the
validity of the fiscal rule.
Norway faces substantial fiscal challenges over the long run, especially from an ageing
population. Age-related spending will gradually surpass the expected real return on the
Pension Fund. It cannot be financed by putting more money into the Pension Fund alone.
As other countries, Norway will have to structure public expenditure arrangements so
they can be sustained as life expectancy increases.
A major pension reform was implemented from 2011. A life expectancy divisor has been
introduced, implying that one has to work longer to maintain a given benefit level when
life expectancy increases. Retirement age has been made flexible, but individuals bear the
full cost of early retirement and get the full economic gain of working longer. Incentives
to work are also improved by a stronger link between contributions and benefits.
Statistics Norway has calculated the effects of the reform on labor supply to be quite
considerable, and it might well be that the pension reform contributes to a somewhat
better long term fiscal balance than indicated by the IMF staff report. The effective
retirement age has also risen in the recent years. Nevertheless, changing incentives to
increase labor supply should be the main route to long term fiscal sustainability, and the
Norwegian authorities take note of the advice regarding the need for further reforms in
the disability pension scheme and the sickness leave scheme.
Monetary Policy
The Norwegian authorities generally concur with staff’s assessment of monetary policy.
If downside risks materialize, monetary policy should be the first line of defense. If
conditions warrant, measures could include not only policy rate changes, but also
liquidity measures.
In the October 2011 Monetary Policy Report, Norges Bank’s baseline outlook for the
Norwegian economy was for growth to remain robust. Inflation, albeit currently low,
would eventually accelerate. In November and December, the risk of a renewed recession

3
within the euro area increased markedly. The situation in the euro area led to
considerable disturbances in the European banking system and money and credit markets.
Short-term and long-term funding became increasingly costly and less accessible for
European banks. Market funding also became more expensive and less accessible for
Norwegian banks. To dampen the effect of the intensified turbulence in financial markets
and weaker prospects for external growth, Norges Bank cut the key policy rate to 1.75
per cent on December 14, 2011. In its communication, Norges Bank pointed out that “in a
situation with elevated uncertainty, it may be appropriate to take measures to mitigate
effects of a particularly adverse outcome on the economy. The Executive Board is of the
view that it is appropriate to reduce the key policy rate now in order to guard against an
economic setback and even lower inflation.”
There is a risk that a potential further deepening of the euro crisis could erode business
confidence and constrain the otherwise buoyant business investment climate. If oil prices
were to decline significantly during a prolonged international downturn, activity in
Norway could fall. In the medium to long term, imbalances could intensify further due to
high levels of debt in Norwegian households, making them vulnerable to loss of income
and higher interest rates.
The objective of monetary policy in Norway is low and stable inflation. There are limits
to the number of considerations monetary policy can attend to. In this regard, my
authorities agree with staff’s recommendation for more targeted instruments to dampen
the build-up of risk in the financial system.
Financial sector issues
Norwegian financial institutions have improved their capital base somewhat and have
also to a certain extent improved their funding situation over the last years. The strength
of the Norwegian economy is a risk-reducing factor for Norwegian financial institutions’
domestic operations. Norwegian financial institutions’ balance sheets are, however,
vulnerable to a deterioration of international macroeconomic conditions. Increased
turbulence in global financial markets, and weaker demand for goods and services by
Norway’s trading partners, could easily have a negative impact on banks’ credit risk and
funding.
There is a close relationship between household debt and developments in the housing
market. As noted, house prices have increased over a prolonged period, and households’
debt-to-disposable income ratio has reached an all-time high of more than 200 per cent.
My authorities agree with staff that high household debt, combined with high and rising
house prices, pose a significant risk to financial stability. Most Norwegian households are
homeowners, and residential mortgages make up approximately 85 per cent of household
debt. Households are vulnerable to higher interest rates, loss of income and/or a drop in
prices for residential property, while banks are vulnerable to losses stemming from
financial problems in the household sector, be it directly or via lower household demand.
Continued low interest rates may influence expectations of households and contribute to
further increases in house prices and household debt.

4
Regulation and supervision are important contributors to confidence in the financial
system and to financial stability. Supervision of banking and other parts of the financial
sector promotes solid financial institutions with good risk awareness, management and
control. The government is presently preparing the institutional framework for and the
introduction of new macro prudential policies based inter alia on the recommendations in
Basel III and the European Commission proposal for CRD IV. We have duly noted the
advice in the staff report.
As also referred to in the report, the Norwegian Financial Supervisory Authority has
recently adopted amendments strengthening its guidelines for prudent residential
mortgage lending. The limit for what is considered a prudent loan-to-value ratio for
residential mortgages was reduced from 90 to 85 per cent of the property’s market value
in late 2011. This limit applies to all loans secured by the property. Further, if total
lending exceeds 70 per cent of the property’s market value, interest-only loans should be
avoided. Banks and other regulated lenders operating in the Norwegian market are also
recommended to make allowances for at least a 5 percentage point increase in interest
rates when assessing a loan applicant’s debt-servicing capacity. The FSA has indicated
that breach of the guidelines may compel the FSA to impose higher capital requirements
in accordance with the Basel II Pillar 2 process. As a part of the general housing policy a
state agency (Husbanken) manages a designated policy towards specific and vulnerable
groups in the housing market.
The Basel III and the proposed CRD IV frameworks recommend certain standard
regulatory risk weights for residential mortgages, and also allow for lower risk weights in
banks’ own internal rating models. My authorities are concerned that these risk weights
may be too low, and lead to too low capital requirements for banks operating in the
Norwegian market. This issue will be discussed both domestically and with the Nordic
neighbors. Important factors here are the method used for calculating minimum capital
requirements, as well as the required minimum percentages. In December 2011 the
Ministry of Finance decided that the so-called Basel I floor, requiring a minimum level
for the denominator of the capital requirement calculation, should be continued for an
indefinite period for Norwegian banks.
Tax policy
My authorities acknowledge that owner-occupied housing is favored both as regards the
income tax and as regards the wealth tax. Home ownership is deeply rooted in Norway.
This implies that an increased tax burden on people’s homes is a challenging political
issue. Despite this, a new and fairer model for assessing the tax value of homes for the
purpose of wealth taxation was implemented from 2010, implying a roughly 25 per cent
increase in such values.
If a tax on imputed rents is not deemed feasible, limited deductibility of mortgage interest
payments might be seen as a possible second best measure, but with some clear
disadvantages. Most importantly, housing investments would be affected only to the
extent they are debt financed. Moreover, it will be difficult and costly in practice to
distinguish mortgage interest payments from other interest expenses. An inadequate

5
distinction may cause investment distortions. A substantial reduction in the tax value of
mortgage deductions, however, followed the implementation of the dual tax system in
1992 when interest payments became deductible only against the low capital tax (with a
tax rate of 28 percent).
My authorities take note of staff’s recommendation to introduce an allowance for
corporate equity (ACE). So far few countries have introduced a deduction for the cost of
equity in the corporate tax. Most countries seem reluctant to forego their share of the
source-based taxation. My authorities do not rule out a consideration of the ACE-model
sometime in the future, but have no immediate plan to introduce such a substantial
change to the tax system.
