TUVALU
STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2012 ARTICLE IV CONSULTATION

KEY ISSUES
Context and growth prospects. Growth has returned after the financial crisis but
remains slow, as demand for seafarers, Tuvalu’s largest source of private employment
and foreign exchange, has not recovered. The strong Australian dollar, which Tuvalu uses
as its currency, has helped keep inflation under control, but has contributed to a
widening current account deficit. The budget deficit has begun to fall as tax compliance
has improved and the government has taken steps to control spending. But financing
buffers are nearly empty, and global financial uncertainty has kept the country’s asset
holdings below the level at which they can be used to help.
Risks. A renewed shock to global growth would further dent demand for seafarers and
seasonal employment, hurting growth, while financial market turmoil would depress
Tuvalu’s asset holdings. A sudden devaluation of the Australian dollar could also cause
inflation to spike.
Ensuring macroeconomic sustainability. Reining in the fiscal deficit is key to restoring
both fiscal and external sustainability. This will require further trimming of non-priority
spending and improved tax compliance among public enterprises. Improving the
prospects for Tuvaluans to work abroad will be essential to long-term replacement of
seafarer income and stabilizing the current account.
Supporting private sector growth. Continued progress on moving public enterprises to
a commercial orientation will help improve the business climate. Stronger risk
management at the country’s banks will eventually allow balance sheets to be rebuilt and
better support private sector lending.

2012 ARTICLE IV REPORT

BACKGROUND AND OUTLOOK
1.

Tuvalu is the Fund’s smallest member. With a population of only 11,000, the scope for

economic diversification, including for exports, is minimal, and nearly all goods are imported (Figure
1). Tuvalu uses the Australian dollar as its currency and has no central bank. The main sources of
foreign exchange have been the earnings of Tuvaluans working abroad, particularly as seafarers, and
donor assistance. Absolute poverty is rare and access to primary education effectively universal.
Though provision of health services is limited by the country’s small size, Millennium Development
Goals health targets are on track to be reached by 2015. Including its roles in health and education,
the public sector employs around a tenth of the country’s population, and deficits have been
persistent even in good times. These are generally closed via donor support, but also via
disbursements from the country’s budget support fund, the Consolidated Investment Fund (CIF).
2.

Growth has been slow following the global financial crisis. After two consecutive years of

decline, the economy revived in 2011, growing by 1.1 percent. Recovery was led by an increasingly
competitive private retail sector and increased education spending. But seafarer employment, which
has not recovered from the financial crisis, has dragged on growth. Inflation, at 0.5 percent in 2011,
has remained under control as increased retail competition, the strong Australian dollar, and shifting
trade patterns have countered upward commodity price pressures.
3.

A large fiscal expansion during 2009-10, now slowly being unwound, has nearly

exhausted available financing buffers. Between 2005 and 2008, government expenditure
averaged 80 percent of GDP while grants and revenue averaged 71 percent (Figure 3). But by 2010,
expenditure had risen to 104 percent, while revenue remained at 74 percent. The result was that the
CIF fell from 34 to 21 percent of GDP. In 2011, expenditure fell to 93 percent of GDP, lowering the
before-grants budget deficit to A$12.9 million. To bolster revenue, the government has signed two
joint ventures (JVs) with Asian fishing companies. These have yet to produce significant revenue, but
Tuvalu’s share of their A$20 million in market-rate debt could represent a contingent liability of
28 percent of GDP. In all, despite higher donor financing, the CIF fell to only 11 percent of GDP, or
A$3.1 million, by end-year.

TUVALU

The trade and current account deficits are widening, but reserves continue to rise.

Imports have risen strongly in recent years, and the trade deficit in 2011 reached 58 percent of GDP.
Remitted wages fell during most of the 2000s, from around 30 percent of GDP in 2001–2003 to only
8 percent in 2011. Donor grants and income from the country’s large holdings of foreign assets (see
below) are substantial, but the current account deficit (less errors and omissions) in 2011 still
reached 8 percent of GDP1. This was partly financed through the rundown of the CIF, but high
capital grants from donors compensated, allowing reserves to grow to 6.7 months of import
coverage.
5.

Tuvalu’s asset holdings are recovering, but remain below pre-crisis peaks. The Tuvalu

Trust Fund (TTF), originally capitalized by donors in 1988, aims to provide a stable principal from
which income can be used for budget support. The investment strategy aims at a 4½ percent real
return. Holdings are global, but Australian assets are weighted heavily. At end-March 2012 it held
A$122.9 million (345 percent of GDP). The TTF is not fully sovereign: its principal cannot be drawn
down without consent of its Board, upon which donors are represented. When its investment value
exceeds a “maintained value” indexed to Australian CPI, the excess can be transferred into the CIF,
which can be freely drawn upon for budget support. Over its history, returns have averaged
8.4 percent, but during 2008-2011 this fell to 0.5 percent, pulling the TTF well below its maintained
value. However, a recovery in early 2012 has closed this gap to only 3.6 percent. This has come at
the same time as a shift in portfolio strategy, from static benchmark-matching to dynamic targeting
of risk and return, has defensively shifted the portfolio toward low-risk assets.
6.

The government has laid out an agenda to address economic challenges. A Policy

Reform Matrix (PRM) of commitments stemming from Tuvalu’s development strategy Te Kakeega II
(TKII) will serve as disbursement criteria for increased program support from donors. The PRM has
four main areas: governance, social development, education and human resources, and
macroeconomic growth and stability. Implementation should ease fiscal constraints by raising
growth, improving tax collections and reducing non-priority expenditure, and unlocking additional
budget support (Box 1).
1

Before errors and omissions the deficit was around 29 percent of GDP, but the authorities believe this is an
overstatement. The 2010 current account deficit was 3¾ percent of GDP.

7.

2012 ARTICLE IV REPORT

Growth prospects depend on creating conditions for private sector growth and

encouraging work abroad. Exports of goods and services in 2011 totaled only 12 percent of GDP.
Increasing competitiveness thus relies upon developing opportunities, such as seasonal labor
schemes in Australia and New Zealand, and skills so more Tuvaluans can work abroad; broadening
financial intermediation to allow for greater accumulation of savings, particularly for returning and
retired workers; and macroeconomic policies that buffer the economy as much as possible against
external shocks.
8.

Short-term risks are on the downside. With minimal exports and the slow recovery of

seafarer employment, upside growth risks are small. On the other hand, linkages to global growth
trends and imported commodity price shocks are a serious concern (Box 2). In addition, the
country’s large asset holdings constitute a significant channel by which financial market shocks can
feed into the domestic economy (Box 3). Finally, the volatile Australian dollar swings imports and
government revenue in ways difficult to accommodate, and natural disasters such as drought are
always a concern. With fiscal buffers still weak and no other significant levers, additional donor
support would be the only potential source of funds to respond to a shock of almost any nature.
9.

Long run risks are significant. In the long run, internet and telephone licensing revenue

may decline as these technologies age, and fishing resources could be depleted unless stocks are
better studied and managed. Most overseas employment opportunities are for unskilled labor.
Higher productivity migrants are less likely to return, raising prospects for remittances but possibly
hurting long-run skills development in such a small country. Most crucially, climate change is a
fundamental risk to the world’s second lowest-lying country. Rising sea temperatures and irregular
rainfall are already cited as reasons for declining income from fish and crops, and higher sea levels
could render much of the country uninhabitable.
10.

Authorities’ Views. The authorities share the mission’s views on economic conditions. They

note that the PRM aims at both near-term macroeconomic management to address fiscal and
external challenges, as well as supporting health, education, and private sector growth, to enhance
Tuvalu’s long-term prospects.

POLICY DISCUSSIONS
Macroeconomic Stability
11.

Fiscal policy is the only macroeconomic policy lever and buffer against external

shocks. With no monetary policy independence, a highly mobile labor force, reliance on imported
goods, and minimal financial diversification, Tuvalu’s only policy instrument for dealing with external
shocks is fiscal policy, particularly the buffer of the CIF. The real exchange rate has also appreciated
in recent years, largely due to the strength of the Australian dollar, which may at the margin be
discouraging Tuvalu’s main external adjustment mechanism, labor migration (Appendix I).

A.

Fiscal Policy

12.

The government has taken important measures, though difficult choices remain. Much

of the 2009/10 jump in spending went to approval of new scholarships for Tuvaluans studying
abroad and payments for medical services in Fiji conducted under the Tuvalu Medical Treatment
Scheme (TMTS). Despite large unspent balances in the Falekaupule Trust Fund (FTF), which pools
funds for such projects, central government spending on Outer Islands capital programs also grew.
Some reforms to the TMTS have been made, such as eliminating free travel for caretakers, reducing
housing costs, and the hiring of a surgeon in Tuvalu. A committee of doctors has also been
established to approve referrals, a crucial step both for reducing costs and for securing donor
support for severe cases. The government will also approve no new scholarships this year, but
ongoing costs for current recipients remain high. Capital expenditure is budgeted to fall from
13.3 percent of GDP in 2011 to 5.9 percent of GDP in 2012, close to pre-crisis levels, and is expected
to remain low.
13.

Revenue reforms may support long-run consolidation, but will not provide much

support this year. Licensing revenues for the .tv domain will rise under a new regime. But with all
telecommunications and most fishing revenue denominated in U.S. dollars, continued Australian
dollar strength depresses proceeds. Compliance with Tuvalu’s new VAT is rising among private
companies but remains poor among public enterprises (PEs). A rise in rates from 4 to 7 percent,
though postponed from 2012 to 2013, will help. Going forward, the PRM aims to improve VAT

6

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

TUVALU

2012 ARTICLE IV REPORT

compliance to 75 percent of eligible taxpayers, including all PEs, and the government has
recommended a further rate increase, to 10 percent, in 2015. A new obejctive-based investment
strategy for the TTF is intended to allow more flexibility in achieving target returns with less
volatility, with additional oversight to ensure investments do not present undue risks.
14.

Authorities’ Views. The government remains strongly committed to improving Tuvalu’s

fiscal outlook. They emphasize that the agenda for reforms is ambitious: large tax increases,
reductions to popular programs, and tougher penalties for tax evasion; and that significant steps
have already been taken. They further note that while donors have in some areas taken up the slack
from declining government support, here too, more work will be necessary.

B.

External Sustainability

15.

The risk in Tuvalu is not an immediate balance of payments crisis but a liquidation of

the country’s asset holdings. Freely usable foreign reserves are comprised of the CIF and the
foreign assets (mostly Australian time deposits) of the National Bank of Tuvalu (NBT). This stock
peaked in 2008 at 8.6 months of import coverage. Government financing needs have nearly drained
the CIF, while a sustained period of low seafarer employment could eventually force the NBT to run
down its own holdings as deposits are liquidated. Nominal and real appreciation have also widened
the current account deficit and reduced the domestic currency value of seafarers’ U.S. dollar wages
and government licensing revenue, but the authorities have few levers beyond the CIF and seeking
additional donor support for managing these risks.
16.

Authorities’ views. The authorities also remain concerned about the effect of the strong

Australian dollar on public and private earnings, and agree that income sources need to be
diversified. To mitigate risks, they note that the new investment strategy of the TTF has reduced the
allocation to risky assets, fiscal consolidation will help rebuild the CIF, and that rising uptake by
workers on seasonal schemes should raise incomes, while replacing U.S. dollar-denominated
seafarer wages with wages denominated in Australian dollars.

Creating the Conditions for Private Sector Growth
17.

TKII sets a goal that the private sector will constitute half of GDP by 2015. As of 2010,

private sector activity – that is, GDP less government services and PEs - accounted for only around a
quarter of GDP, and has not risen significantly in the past ten years. Stronger private growth will be
predicated on a more sustainable macroeconomic, especially fiscal, framework, as discussed above,
but will also require addressing various drags on growth. Improving the ability of the financial
sector, comprised of the state-owned Development Bank of Tuvalu (DBT) and NBT, to lend will
require sustained reforms that, in turn, are part of a broader agenda to reform Tuvalu’s PEs.
18.

Government intervention is widespread. Public enterprises dominate the economy.

Management has historically been poor, and the introduction of a VAT has raised the stakes for
weak tax compliance2. A broad reform agenda has had mixed results (Box 4). On the other hand, the
government also runs the Tuvalu National Provident Fund (TNPF), which invests a share of all
workers’ earnings. TNPF holdings are collectible upon retirement, but before maturity can be
borrowed against up to a third of total holdings. Recently, delinquencies have been rising for these
small loans. In addition, almost all retirees take lump-sum withdrawals, reducing the TNPF’s
usefulness for retirement savings.
19.

Financial sector lending capacity is limited. Around half the assets at the NBT, the

country’s sole deposit-taking bank, are nonperforming. Around one-third of this is PE lending, but
the largest share is now related to a rental housing-construction scheme, initiated by the
government but financed by the NBT, which has now been ended. Interest rates are set by fiat, with
deposit rates fixed for more than four years and lending rates fixed since they were cut in 2010 by
an across-the-board government directive. Nevertheless, high spreads have kept lending profitable.
The NBT also has a monopoly over foreign exchange transaction fees, and these are its main source
of income. Small businesses in Tuvalu are more likely to borrow from the smaller DBT, though here
too, around half the lending portfolio is nonperforming. Both banks have now tightened lending
standards, but the process began earlier at the DBT, which has now begun to write off its
nonperforming portfolio.

However, given large arrears by the government to PEs, the net fiscal gain from enforcement could be small.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

20.

2012 ARTICLE IV REPORT

Authorities’ views. The government remains committed to PE reform, and while

acknowledging that progress has been mixed, notes improved collections and compensation
practices. They agree with the staff’s views on the financial system, but emphasize the need to
ensure financial system inclusiveness.

Other Issues
21.

Article XIV/VIII. At the time of joining the Fund, Tuvalu availed itself of the transitory

provisions of Article XIV, Section 2. While the exchange control regulations are quite restrictive and
prescribe approval requirements from the NBT or the Finance Minister for most payments or
transfers, in practice, no approval is required and payments and transfers for current international
transactions are administered liberally. Staff recommended that the regulations be updated in line
with current practice so that Tuvalu can accept the obligations of Article VIII, Sections 2, 3 and 4.
Spreads charged on NBT wire transactions also differ by currency, which is a long-standing practice,
but has little commercial basis and may even constitute a multiple currency practice.
22.

Anti-Money Laundering and Combating the Financing of Terrorism (AML/CFT). While a

law on AML/CFT was drafted in consultation with Australia and approved in 2006, Tuvalu should
consider applying for membership in a Financial Action Task Force (FATF)-style regional body.
23.

The authorities are working closely with PFTAC in a range of areas. Capacity at Tuvalu’s

statistics office has grown as regular PFTAC missions have assisted in the compilation of balance of
payments and national accounts data, but given the small size of the office, further support from
donors will be necessary to produce a better picture of the country’s economic situation. The
authorities have also expressed a willingness to move fiscal data to GFS 2001 format, and an initial
mission visited Tuvalu in early May. Revenue administration has benefitted strongly from on the job
training from a PFTAC-funded long-term consultant in Funafuti. PFTAC will also support the
development of a reform plan for public financial management, a key element of the PRM.
24.

Authorities’ view. The authorities agree that payment restrictions on current transactions

are unlikely to be necessary and have expressed a willingness to introduce eliminating legislation.
The authorities indicated their openness to participate in the Asia/Pacific Group on Money
Laundering (APG). They look forward to further cooperation with PFTAC on various areas, noting

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

9

2012 ARTICLE IV REPORT

TUVALU

that in areas such as public financial management, tax collection and statistical capacity, further
donor support for long-term advisors would be helpful.

STAFF APPRAISAL
25.

Now is the time to build on last year’s successful measures to bring the budget under

control. Steps taken to bring down TMTS costs, and the decision to approve no new scholarships
this year were difficult and commendable. Thanks to these steps, improved tax compliance by the
private sector, and a large one-off Australian grant, the fiscal position has improved in the past year.
But budget support next year will be tied to implementing the PRM. Raising VAT rates is important,
but raising compliance among PEs – currently none of which pay VAT– will be crucial both to bring
deficits down in the future and for securing budget support from donors. The next step for direct
taxes is to follow through with penalties for noncompliance, including nonfinancial ones. On
subsidies, returning TMTS referrals to a committee of doctors should begin to bring costs down. The
authorities should also continue to coordinate with donors to ensure scholarships remain at a
sustainable level and bring subsidies to PEs transparently on budget. Public wage increases should
also be tied more closely to inflation. Finally, new JVs should be signed with care, and only after
verifying that any borrowing does not endanger concessional assistance from donors.
26.

Going forward, expenditure should be reoriented toward supporting social goals and

growth. The PRM rightly focuses on primary education and streamlining health expenditure. More
support for training, particularly for women and in nontraditional areas, and by determining priority
areas for scholarships, will improve Tuvalu’s ability to send productive workers abroad, as will taking
more advantage of seasonal labor schemes in Australia and New Zealand. Cuts to capital
expenditure should not postpone needed infrastructure improvements, and Outer Islands projects
should be clearly prioritized and financed by the FTF’s unspent balances rather than relatively scarce
government resources.
27.

These and other ongoing efforts will make Tuvalu’s external position more

sustainable. Given labor, donor and trade flows, the use of the Australian dollar remains
appropriate, but buffers should be rebuilt to restore resilience. Smaller budget deficits will allow the
government’s assets to be rebuilt while better training and more opportunities for Tuvaluan workers,

10

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

TUVALU

2012 ARTICLE IV REPORT

in New Zealand and increasingly in Australia, will help cushion the blow of declining seafarer
demand. The new objective-based asset allocation of the TTF should be implemented with a strong
bias toward protecting Tuvalu’s asset holdings, both of the TTF and the TNPF, from risky conditions
in global financial markets.
28.

Continuing to implement the PE reform agenda is key to supporting growth.

Addressing tax arrears and poor customer payment culture is especially challenging in small
countries. Improved accounting procedures should help sort out the net position of unpaid
government supplier payments to PEs and PE tax arrears, but more important in the long run will be
ensuring both parties make all payments on time and transparently. The effort to commercialize PE
operations is paying off with improved risk management at the NBT and higher utilities collections.
In the long run, this will increase the flow of dividends to the government, easing fiscal pressures
and freeing capital for lending.
29.

The financial system has made significant strides, and progress seems likely to

continue. The improved focus on credit quality and financial position of the DBT and NBT are
encouraging. In particular, the DBT has begun to clean its balance sheets by writing down
uncollectible loans. As the NBT’s risk monitoring capabilities improve, it should begin to do the
same. To ensure the continued financial health of the TNPF, the authorities should seek to have its
actuarial viability assessed, and also amend the law to encourage retirees to take annuities rather
than lump-sum withdrawals.
30.

Government intervention in the economy should also be reduced. As they return to

health, the DBT and NBT should gradually be allowed to set their own rates, at least in areas, such as
lending to businesses, where they are already effectively in competition. Installing a new and fully
professional board at the electric company to ensure the company’s independence will show that
Tuvalu is serious about improved PE management.
31.

Data shortcomings, particularly in the national accounts and balance of payments,

hamper surveillance. Additional resources will need to be provided to compile data necessary for
surveillance and to support policymaking.
32.

Staff recommends that the next Article IV consultation take place on a 24-month

cycle.

TUVALU

Box 1. Tuvalu’s Policy Reform Matrix
A new Policy Reform Matrix (PRM) aims to strengthen the policy framework and coordinate
budget support. With the assistance of key donors, the exercise aims to tie future budget support
to a common list of measures focused on preserving fiscal sustainability, rebuilding the
government’s reserves in the Consolidated Investment Fund (CIF), and improving the
macroeconomic environment.
Fiscal sustainability is the overriding goal.
Keeping the deficit below 10 percent of GDP will
return the CIF to a sustainable level. Key measures
include tying wages more closely to inflation,
reducing travel costs and nonpriority transfers and
subsidies, while Community Service Obligations
(CSOs) would be contained below 5 percent of
GDP (See Box 4). Concurrently, priority health and
education spending would rise. Higher VAT rates
and better enforcement will further increase fiscal
space.
Without implementation, financing constraints
will force spending cuts. Revenues would stall at
around A$24 million, recurring grants at around
A$4½ million, and additional World Bank
financing of around A$1¾ million. With
expenditure expected at around A$33 million, the
government would have to make unpalatable cuts
or exhaust the CIF.

that a better business climate and additional

revenue collection, implementation would also unlock donor support: commitments from the ADB,
Australia, and New Zealand would rise from A$4.5 million to A$9 million. Staff calculates that full
implementation would allow higher and more focused public spending, rising to around A$40
million by 2017. The implications of PRM implementation for Tuvalu’s debt sustainability are
discussed in the accompanying Debt Sustainability Analysis.

2012 ARTICLE IV REPORT

Box 2. Tuvalu and Global Shocks
Tuvalu’s economy is small and open. Work
on merchant ships is traditionally the largest
source of foreign exchange and is tied to
volatile global trade, while the shift to seasonal
employment in Australia and New Zealand will
expose Tuvaluans to those countries’ labor
markets. Nearly everything, including skilled
services, is imported, with fuel and food
constituting about half of total goods imports.
The recent shift to Asian suppliers has helped
contain inflation, but a sudden depreciation of
the Australian dollar, as in 2008, could lead to a
spike in prices of consumer goods.
Growth is tied to global and regional cycles,
and exposed to commodity price shocks.
Growth is linked to Australian GDP (correlation
of 0. 36) but not with New Zealand (-0.01).
Recent IMF analytical work assesses linkages
between Pacific Island countries and broader
economies, finding an elasticity of Tuvaluan
GDP growth to global growth of 0.5.1 The paper
further finds under a 2012-13 shock to global
growth of 1.5 percent emanating from the Euro
Area, the effect on Tuvalu would be relatively
strong but short-lived. A 50 percent rise in oil
prices would also affect Tuvalu similarly to the
median Pacific Island country.
Pass-through of global price shocks is not
complete. Price controls on staple foods
dampen the effect of global food price shocks,
though these do follow global trends. The
correlation of domestic energy prices with
global fuel prices is 0.36, reduced by
government subsidies for inter-island freight2.
However, these measures drag on private
retailers and the budget, respectively.

Box 3. Links to Global Financial Markets
The government has extensive foreign asset
holdings, though these funds are not fully
sovereign. The TTF, jointly controlled with
Australia and New Zealand, is by far the largest.
The Tuvalu National Provident Fund (TNPF) invests
social contributions from slightly more than half
the country’s population, and the Falekaupule
Trust Fund (FTF) is a pool to finance investment
projects in the Outer Islands. All three funds are
invested along TTF guidelines, exposing not only
the government but also local governments and
the retirement holdings of individuals to global

While an important source of funds for the

2012 ARTICLE IV REPORT

Box 4. Public Enterprises in Tuvalu
Most public enterprises (PEs) are financially weak. Low tariff structures, arrears on payments by
the government, and structural inefficiencies, many aggravated by Tuvalu’s small size, are the major
impediments. Limited availability of experienced managers and boards chaired by civil servants
hinder the prospects of PEs to operate on a commercial basis. But PE losses strain government
finances, lead to overdrafts at the NBT, and worsen the country’s business climate.

An ambitious reform plan was launched in 2008. A Public Enterprise Act (PEA) was passed in
2010 establishing a unit tasked with monitoring and managing the performance of all PEs. The act
requires operation of PEs on a commercial basis
Return on Assets of Public Enterprises in Tuvalu: 2007-10
(Percent)
and removal of civil servants from boards. It also
40
aims to regularize government financial relations
30
20
with PEs, which are undermined by disagreement
10
over the net size of tax arrears and unpaid
0
government bills. The government is also now
-10
obliged to compensate PEs on-budget for
-20
necessary but uneconomical services, such as

negotiated with the PEs.
The process has been slow and success has been mixed. Beyond the NBT and TEC, prospects for
profitability are poor without improved management. When profitable, few PEs pay corporate
income tax, none pay VAT, and some do not make social contribution payments for employees. In
2011, the independent board of TEC was suspended following a billing dispute, reversing one of the
PEA’s main successes. CSOs were also dropped from the 2012 budget. On the other hand, TTC and
TEC tariffs were reviewed in 2010 and the government is considering privatization of the Vaiaku Lagi
Hotel. Beyond this, government departments responsible for public works such as roads and ports
are being considered for corporatization.

Tuvalu’s legal tender is the Australian dollar. There is no central monetary institution. Tuvalu
avails itself of transitional arrangements under Section 2 of Article XIV and has not yet accepted
the obligations under Article VIII, Sections 2, 3, and 4. The legal framework for the exchange
and trade system is the Exchange Control Law of 1981 and the Exchange Control Regulations of
1983, as amended. Staff continue to conduct a comprehensive review of the exchange system
to assess jurisdictional implications. While the Exchange Control Regulations are quite restrictive
and prescribe approval requirements from the National Bank of Tuvalu (NBT) or the Minister of
Finance for most payments or transfers, in practice, no approval is required and transactions are
administered liberally.
The NBT is the only bank in Tuvalu handling foreign exchange transactions. The NBT buys and
sells foreign exchange at rates determined daily by the NBT’s board on the basis of rates
quoted in the international markets plus specific spreads dependent on the specific foreign
currency.

ANNEX II. TUVALU: WORLD BANK–IMF COLLABORATION
The Bank and Fund country teams, currently led by Mr. James P. Walsh (Fund mission chief
for Tuvalu) and Mr. Piers Merrick (country officer, EACNQ), have maintained a close working
relationship since Tuvalu’s decision to pursue membership of the Bretton Woods institutions
in 2009. The Bank team has joined all IMF missions to Tuvalu since the country’s membership
mission, including both Article IV missions and the 2011 IMF staff visit.
The teams agree that Tuvalu’s main macroeconomic challenges are to put revenues and
expenditure on a more sustainable footing, strengthening public service delivery, and
creating a more supportive environment for development. Based on this shared assessment, the
teams identified the following structural reform areas, all of which are also addressed in the
authorities’ Policy Reform Matrix (PRM), as macro-critical:
i.

Strengthening public financial management. In the absence of its own currency and
monetary policy, sound fiscal policy is key to maintaining macroeconomic stability. However,
the large run-up in spending in recent years has almost exhausted the country’s fiscal
buffers. While those buffers are rebuilt, asset income needs to be saved, and the mediumterm budget framework used to highlight the longer-term impact of current fiscal stance
and new spending initiatives. Moreover, budget reporting and monitoring need to be
improved and economic and policy analysis capacity should be strengthened.

ii.

Reforming public enterprises. The government, with ADB support, has begun a
comprehensive public enterprise reform program to improve current weak performance and
profitability. Ensuring public enterprises are independently and professionally run, address
issues of tax arrears and payment delinquency, and are transparently subsidized for
provision of essential but noneconomic activities will strengthen Tuvalu’s business climate
and lessen the drain on public resources.

iii.

Exploring opportunities for poverty reduction, job creation, and private sector
development. Tuvalu’s geographic isolation, small size, and poor land quality have made it
challenging to generate domestic private sector employment. Demand for Tuvaluan
seafarers on the international maritime employment market is declining, due to rising
competition from other countries, and existing labor migration schemes have not been well

TUVALU 2012 ARTICLE IV REPORT—INFORMATIONAL ANNEX

utilized. Adequate education and training need to be provided for Tuvaluans to better utilize
overseas job opportunities and to reduce rising poverty.
iv.

Strengthening public service delivery. The Government of Tuvalu in the TKII and the
medium term reform agenda identified improving service delivery in the health and
education sectors as key objectives. Based on analysis from the Health and Education
Medium Term Expenditure Framework and other analytical work, the Government has begun
to consider reforms to ensure appropriate allocation between primary and tertiary service
delivery, and maximizing returns on scare resources.

The teams expect to sustain the close cooperation going forward. Attachment 1 details

ANNEX III. TUVALU: RELATIONS WITH THE ASIAN
DEVELOPMENT BANK
Partnerships
The Asian Development Bank (ADB) has partnered with the Government of Tuvalu since 1993, and
has provided US$7.82 million for three loan projects, one program grant of US$3.24 million, and 20
technical assistance projects amounting to US$5.91 million.
The country partnership strategy, 2009–2012, was prepared in collaboration with the Australian
Agency for International Development, the New Zealand Aid Programme, and other major
development partners. ADB’s operational strategy complements Te Kakeega II by focusing on
improving governance and economic management, in particular public financial management and
public enterprise reforms.
ADB participates as a team member of the International Monetary Fund Article IV Mission to Tuvalu,
and liaises closely with the Pacific Financial Technical Assistance Centre—particularly on
macroeconomic management and fiscal conditions.
ADB is an active member of the Tuvalu donor group network, disseminating information and
participating in meetings, including the development partners meetings held in December 2011 and
March 2012. Following the request from government for budget financing, the government has
prepared, in collaboration with development partners, a Policy Reform Matrix (PRM) containing a set
of agreed policy actions, which when implemented would trigger the release of budget support.
ADB has also committed to undertake joint missions with development partners to improve
coordination and lessen demands on country capacity. A joint donor mission to Tuvalu was
undertaken in April 2012 to further discuss the PRM.
ADB observes the biannual meetings of the Tuvalu Trust Fund (TTF) Board and cooperates with civil
society organizations in Tuvalu to strengthen the effectiveness, quality, and sustainability of its
services.
ADB Supported Projects and Programs
From November 1999 to July 2001, ADB worked closely with the government to implement the
Island Development Program loan and technical assistance program. This focused on improving

7

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

2012 ARTICLE IV REPORT—INFORMATIONAL ANNEX

TUVALU

governance and economic management, enhancing employment opportunities through skills
development, and improving services on the outer islands. The loan was closed in 2001 and rated
successful. ADB also completed the upgrade of the Tuvalu Maritime Training Institute in 2010. Rated
partly successful, the new structures and training facilities enable the institute to remain accredited
with the International Maritime Organization, and will improve the education and skills of Tuvaluan
seafarers so that they can compete for jobs overseas.
ADB supports programs under the Pacific Plan for Strengthening Regional Cooperation and
Integration, approved by heads of government at the Pacific Islands Forum in 2005, which
emphasizes regional public goods and services. Collective management of increased aviation safety
and security requirements under the ADB-financed Pacific Aviation Safety Office is a good example
of its potential.
The Improved Financial Management Program grant for US$3.24 million was approved in December
2008. In early 2009, the first tranche of US$1.24 million was disbursed after agreed conditions were
met. A public enterprise reform and monitoring unit was formed to monitor public enterprise
performance. Early in 2011, a public expenditure and financial accountability assessment was
undertaken, which will help the government identify weaknesses in public financial management
systems. The second tranche of US$2 million was disbursed in 2011.
Supportive technical assistance helped build the government’s capacity to meet commitments under
the program. Overall, the performance of public enterprises is encouraging, collectively showing a
positive return on equity, instead of the historical break even or loss.
Future Directions
ADB’s operational strategy will focus on improving public financial management, and supporting the
process of public enterprise reform, with specific objectives to improve their governance,
administration, and profitability.
A second program grant and supporting technical assistance is planned to help Tuvalu build on the
previous program, and ensure that the reform momentum is sustained.
Tuvalu will continue to benefit from regional projects in the areas of economic management and
governance, climate change, solid waste management, and support from the Pacific Infrastructure
Advisory Center in the energy and utilities sectors.

TUVALU 2012 ARTICLE IV REPORT—INFORMATIONAL ANNEX

ANNEX IV. TUVALU: PFTAC COUNTRY STRATEGY
2012 –2014
Background
Tuvalu has faced a difficult macroeconomic environment in recent times which has resulted in
pressures on fiscal sustainability. Following the global economic crisis growth stagnated and the
resources available for budget financing from the Tuvalu Trust Fund (TTF) declined due to its fall in
value. With domestic revenues under performing and weakened expenditure control fiscal pressures
became overbearing. This was exacerbated by drought conditions in 2011. Development partner
budget support has enabled operations to continue while the authorities work with partners to
develop a joint policy matrix to underpin future budget support. Tuvalu became an IMF and World
Bank member in 2009.
PFTAC TA has been moderate and concentrated in the revenue and statistics sectors. Recent
PFTAC TA has been focused on assisting the authorities achieve the gains planned from revenue
reforms through on-the-job assistance in revenue administration following the completion of an
ADB project that supported the PFTAC-designed reforms. There has also been significant assistance
in developing national accounts and balance of payments statistics, in part to allow Tuvalu to meet
the requirements of IMF membership.
Strategy 2012-2014
PFTAC’s TA strategy is guided by the APD regional strategy note and is planned within the results
framework for the current PFTAC funding cycle.1
PFTAC TA aims to support the authorities sustain progress on improving fiscal sustainability.
PFTAC will continue to work closely with the broader development partner group to ensure
coherence and will aim to support implementation of actions in the authorities’ shared policy matrix.
Development of a PFM Roadmap and enhancement of national accounts statistics are expected to
be the main focus.

The specific result in the framework that activities target is identified in italics in the section, for example
cash management is referred to as (1.6), where 1.6 is the code in the result framework in the program
document.

TUVALU

In the Public Financial Management area, PFTAC will be ready to provide support to the
development of a PFM roadmap based on the 2011 PEFA (1.2). Support to implementation of
specific elements will also be available, in coordination with other development partners and in
particular the AusAID-supported budget and treasury advisors. PFTAC would look to assist the
authorities implement a follow-up PEFA assessment, probably in 2015 (1.1).
In the revenue area, the main focus will be on providing support to the proposed AusAID-financed
resident advisor to the revenue administration. Maintenance of appropriate IT solutions will be a
critical element of this advisor’s work (2.3) and PFTAC will look to support this by integrating Tuvalu
officials in regional and sub-regional support groups being developed under PITAA. In 2013 and
beyond, PFTAC will provide assistance to enable the administration to adopt risk management and
compliance improvement strategies and to enhance corporate planning (2.5 and 2.3).
In statistics, PFTAC will continue to provide regular assistance on national accounts compilation
(4.1) and training to increase capacity in the statistics office so that ultimately broader measures of
national income and saving (4.3) can be regularly produced. IMF HQ will provide resources to
produce better current and capital accounts of the balance of payments (4.6-4.8), however, PFTAC
will continue its program of support to BoP compilation with a mission in mid-2012.
In financial sector supervision, PFTAC will be available to provide strategic support should the
authorities begin implementing the financial institutions act passed in 2010. Given the lack of incountry capacity, establishing a basic on and off site supervision program (3.1 and 3.4) will require
TA resources well in excess of PFTAC’s availability. As in other sectors though, PFTAC would be able
to provide strategic oversight to the process if other partners were able to provide resources for on
the job support.
No direct macroeconomic support is currently envisaged, with the TTFAC and ADB’s PEM TA
currently taking the lead in these areas. Planned regional training in longer-term budget planning
and financial programming will provide skills transfer though and PFTAC could provide follow-up TA
if requested.

ANNEX V. TUVALU: STATISTICAL ISSUES
(as of June 13, 2012)
I. Assessment of Data Adequacy for Surveillance
General: Data have shortcomings that hamper surveillance. Shortcomings are most serious in the national
accounts and balance of payments. The Pacific Financial Technical Assistance Centre (PFTAC) has provided
technical assistance to the Central Statistics Division (CSD) of the Ministry of Finance to help start
compiling those statistics for surveillance and the authorities’ own policy analysis and formulation. The
CSD will require additional staff to improve data provisioning.
National accounts: With PFTAC assistance since 2009, the compilation methodology for the national
accounts was improved. Attention needs to be paid to improving source data for national accounts.
Price statistics: The consumer price index (CPI) is the only price index compiled in Tuvalu. The CSD
produces a quarterly CPI, which is timely and of reasonable quality. The CPI weights were revised in 2011,
based on the 2010 Household Income and Expenditure Survey.
Government finance statistics: The MOF compiles the central government data for budget analysis and
control. However, the classifications of some accounts, particularly on capital spending, need to be
improved to be in line with international standards.
Monetary and financial statistics: Tuvalu uses the Australian dollar as its legal tender and does not have
a central bank. Monetary and financial statistics are currently not produced in Tuvalu. The National Bank
of Tuvalu and the Development Bank of Tuvalu provided the Article IV mission with their balance sheets
and income statements, which were used to produce the monetary data on the two banks.
Balance of payments: Balance of payments statistics have been compiled by visiting PFTAC experts.
PFTAC is assisting the authorities in developing a balance of payments compilation system to enable CSD
staff to compile the balance of payments data. They have noted that many of the underlying data have
inconsistencies and errors, resulting in poor quality of the balance of payments statistics. In addition, the
mission noted that the CSD needs better trained staff to produce quality balance of payments statistics.

STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2012 ARTICLE IV
CONSULTATION—DEBT SUSTAINABILITY ANALYSIS

July 6, 2012

Approved By

Masato Miyazaki and
Thomas Dorsey (IMF),
and Jeffrey D. Lewis
and Sudhir Shetty
(World Bank)

Prepared by staffs of the International Monetary Fund and
The World Bank

The conclusion of the first joint IMF/World Bank Debt Sustainability Analysis is that Tuvalu
is at high risk of debt distress. Under baseline assumptions debt ratios are broadly stable in
the long run, but are sensitive to changes in underlying assumptions. Ensuring debt risks
remain contained while the country’s development needs are addressed will require donors
to continue to provide assistance only in the form of grants. 1

This DSA has been produced in consultation with the Asian Development Bank (ADB). It is based on the
common standard LIC DSA framework. Under the Country Policy and Institutional Assessment (CPIA) Tuvalu
has been provisionally rated a weak performer, and the DSA uses the indicative threshold indicators on the
external public debt for countries in this category: 30 percent for the ratio of the present value (PV) of debt to
GDP; 100 percent for the ratio of PV of debt to exports; 200 percent for the ratio of PV of debt to revenue; 15
percent for the ratio of debt service to exports; and 18 percent for the ratio of debt service to revenue.

2012 ARTICLE IV REPORT—DEBT SUSTAINABILITY ANALYSIS TUVALU

BACKGROUND
1.

This is the first Joint IMF/World Bank DSA for Tuvalu. Tuvalu joined the Bank and Fund

in 2010; an Article IV consultation concluded in February 2011 did not incorporate a DSA due to
data limitations. The analysis below is based on the most updated data available to Bank and Fund
staff as of June 2012. Underlying macroeconomic data and debt data were updated during the
2012 Article IV mission to Funafuti, based on discussions with the authorities, donors and the Pacific
Financial Technical Assistance Center (PFTAC).
2.

A preliminary assessment tied to the 2010 IMF Article IV consultation concluded that

Tuvalu was at high risk of debt distress. External debt and debt service ratios breached many
indicative thresholds under the baseline scenarios. Stress tests confirmed that Tuvalu's debt burden
was highly vulnerable to deteriorating macroeconomic conditions or a weaker financing outlook.
Overall, the DSA concluded that greater access to grants would be essential for Tuvalu to meet its
development needs. Since 2010, the fiscal situation has improved somewhat as tax compliance has
improved and spending has begun to be reined in, though the still-strong Australian dollar has
widened trade imbalances.
3.

Tuvalu’s small economy is highly dependent on external flows and vulnerable to

shocks. The smallest member of the Bank and Fund, Tuvalu’s GDP in 2011 was only US$36 million.
Almost all goods, and even many services, are imported; the country’s main sources of foreign
currency are donor assistance and earnings from Tuvaluans working abroad as seafarers; and the
government budget is generally in deficit even in good times. The economy shrank after the global
financial crisis and returned to growth only in 2011, while the strong Australian dollar has boosted
imports.
4.

There are large external holdings of public assets, though these are not freely usable

by the government. The Tuvalu Trust Fund (TTF) was capitalized by donors in 1988 and by endMarch 2012 had grown to 345 percent of GDP (A$122.9 million) through reinvestment of its own
earnings and contributions by the government during surplus periods. The TTF is not fully sovereign:
it can only be drawn down either with approval of its Board (where donors are represented) or when
its market value exceeds a “maintained value” linked to Australian CPI. When it exceeds this value,

2

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

TUVALU 2012 ARTICLE IV REPORT—DEBT SUSTAINABILITY ANALYSIS

additional funds are deposited into the Consolidated Investment Fund (CIF), which the authorities
may freely draw upon. As of mid-2012, the TTF remains around 3.6 percent below its maintained
value, and the CIF holds A$6.1 million, including a A$4.0 million injection from Australia in 2012.
5.

With official borrowing halted since 2008, the main issue is Tuvalu’s outstanding debt

and new borrowings from unofficial sources. Bilateral donors provide only grant assistance.
Tuvalu’s public and publicly guaranteed (PPG) debt stock has declined in the past two years, and
amounted to A$17.3 million (50 percent of GDP) at end-2011. External PPG debt was A$14.9 million
(36.7 percent of GDP in PV terms) at end-2011.The Asian Development Bank (accounting for
42 percent of the stock in PV terms) provided concessional loans until 2008; subsequent
disbursements have been on a grant basis, as – on a provisional basis – was an initial World Bank
disbursement in 2012. However, loans contracted at market rates by joint ventures -(JVs) signed in
2008 and 2010 with companies from Korea and Taiwan Province of China (TPOC) constitute a
possible substantial contingent liability, and guarantees of domestic borrowing by both public and
private enterprises have been made at market rates2. These loans account for half the debt stock in
NPV terms, with the remainder owed to the European Investment Bank3.

MACROECONOMIC FRAMEWORK
6.

Growth is expected to be close to historical averages. Throughout the scenario, growth is

estimated to average 1.2 percent, slightly below the average of the past ten years. Depressed
seafarer employment, at levels that are likely to remain significantly below pre-crisis levels, is
expected to have a negative impact on growth. With little scope for import substitution or export
diversification, the trade balance will remain close to historic norms.
7.

The fiscal outlook is based on a continuation of current trends. Taxes will stabilize at

slightly above current levels, based on continued levels of compliance but with higher tax rates.
2

An effectively defunct and wholly government-owned public enterprise called the National Fishing Corporation of
Tuvalu (NAFICOT), is party to both JVs. NAFICOT owns 50 percent of the TPOC venture and 40 percent of the Korean
one, and pays dividends to the government. Loans taken out by both JVs are on market terms. Tuvalu’s share of the
debts amounts to 28 percent of GDP.
3

The EIB loan is a credit line to the Development Bank of Tuvalu, which is fully owned by the government. Overdrafts
at the National Bank of Tuvalu, which the government uses for cash management but also for short-term financing,
are not included in the debt stock.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND 3

2012 ARTICLE IV REPORT—DEBT SUSTAINABILITY ANALYSIS TUVALU

License revenue will be boosted in 2012 in line with the new .tv domain and fishing license
agreements as well as the depressed U.S. dollar, but will stabilize at this level thereafter. Recurrent
grants are expected to average 14 percent of GDP over the medium and long term. Under the
assumption that other assistance will be provided in the form of grants and no new joint ventures
will be signed, the only new stream of borrowing assumed in the DSA is term IDA borrowing of
A$1¾ million annually. Annual financing needs will thus be covered by concessional financing and
use of half the available CIF balance, with the rest of the CIF, along the lines of previous practice,
being reinvested.
8.

The limited financing envelope forces a consolidation, but expenditure will eventually

expand again. With CIF financing limited and no scope for domestic borrowing, expenditure is
projected to fall by 13 percent of GDP to around 80 percent of GDP in the next few years, with
capital expenditure bearing some of the burden. This will bring the deficit to around A$3½ million
(around 10 percent of GDP). But as the TTF recovers fully and disbursements into the CIF rise,
additional financing will eventually permit the government to raise spending4. For this reason,
beginning around 2016, expenditure will rise modestly, to around 85 percent of GDP.
9.

The current account deficit is expected to improve somewhat. Tuvalu has only eleven

years of balance of payments data, three years of which have been affected by the global financial
crisis. During this time the country’s external assets have grown strongly. Income from these assets
should continue to rise, while employment from seasonal schemes replaces some seafarer income.
Imports are expected to normalize in 2012, post one-off construction projects, and return to their
historical average in the medium term. The current account is projected to settle at around a
4 percent surplus, slightly above its eleven-year average of 2 percent. Reserves rise gradually over
time.
10.

Risks to the baseline are largely on the downside. A slowdown in global growth,

particularly if accompanied by a sudden financing stop that damages global trade, would severely
affect Tuvalu. On the fiscal side, weak revenue performance, from poor tax compliance or from a
decline in fishing or telecommunications licensing proceeds, is a serious risk to the baseline outlook.
4

The scenario assumes TTF nominal returns of 7 percent, slightly below historical levels and in line with the
authorities’ targeted asset returns.

4

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

TUVALU 2012 ARTICLE IV REPORT—DEBT SUSTAINABILITY ANALYSIS

Finally, continued low demand for seafarers or an inability to place workers in seasonal employment
schemes would depress earnings from abroad, weakening the current account.

EXTERNAL AND PUBLIC DEBT SUSTAINABILITY
ANALYSIS
A. External Debt
11.

External debt breaches stock thresholds under the baseline scenario. The ratios of the

present value (PV) of debt to GDP and of debt to exports both begin at high levels due to recently
contracted JV debt. Levels than fall as new concessional lending comes online and older ADB debt is
paid off. As grace periods for concessional loans come to a close, both ratios rise (Figure 1). The
export ratio remains above thresholds throughout the simulation period, while the GDP ratio rises
above only as repayments come into view. The debt service to exports ratio similarly falls from its
current high level to a more sustainable level, but then rises back toward unsustainable levels as
loan repayments come online.
12.

Stress tests show the debt burden is particularly sensitive to growth and exchange rate

assumptions. The PV of public sector external debt closes the simulation at 36 percent of GDP, but
a one-time 30 percent nominal depreciation raises this ratio to 51 percent. Under the historical

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND 5

2012 ARTICLE IV REPORT—DEBT SUSTAINABILITY ANALYSIS TUVALU

scenario, in which the current account deficit does not recover in the medium term and financing
needs remain large, all stock ratios rise throughout the simulation period, with the PV of public
external debt reaching 108 percent of GDP around 2027.

B. Public Debt
13.

Public debt ratios are relatively stable under the baseline. As concessional lending

comes online, the ratios of debt PV to GDP and to revenue both remain close to current levels even
as grace periods come to a close (Figure 2). The ratio of debt service to revenue mostly falls for the
first half of the simulation period, but then rises gradually in the second half as more payments
come due. Historical scenarios for public debt are generally more benign than the baseline.
14.

These ratios are also fragile to shifts in underlying assumptions. GDP growth below

baseline assumptions would raise the public debt burden well above sustainable levels: under the
baseline the PV of public debt in 2032 reaches only 38 percent of GDP, but scenario with
permanently lower GDP growth pushes this ratio to 113 percent. Similar dynamics are observed for
the ratio of PV of debt to revenue, By contrast, given that all long-run debt is on IDA terms, debt
service indicators are not as strongly affected under these scenarios.

IMPLEMENTATION OF THE POLICY REFORM MATRIX
15.

The authorities have presented to donors a Policy Reform Matrix (PRM) which aims,

inter alia, at strengthening macroeconomic management. The PRM is intended to be a reform
roadmap as well as a streamlined list of potential triggers for budget support disbursements by
donors. Its main targets in the areas of macroeconomic management are better tax compliance,
reorientation of expenditure toward priority areas in health and education, and improving the
business environment to strengthen growth. IMF staff estimates that full implementation would
raise growth and investment in Tuvalu modestly, while allowing for some expansion of spending as
the fiscal envelope is widened by better tax collection and additional donor support. Overall, the
deficit is contained below 15 percent of GDP, and the current account surplus stabilizes at around
6 percent of GDP. Significantly, neither under the baseline nor under the alternative scenario is there
any borrowing beyond new IDA disbursements, as there are no additional prospective lenders.

6

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

TUVALU 2012 ARTICLE IV REPORT—DEBT SUSTAINABILITY ANALYSIS

16.

Debt dynamics under the reform scenario are somewhat more benign. Faster GDP

growth would bring the ratio of the PV of external public debt to GDP below sustainability
thresholds and keep it on a gradual downward trend; the relationship with exports is similar
(Figure 3). Debt service ratios display similar dynamics to the baseline, but levels are lower. Public
debt, which remained almost stable under the baseline, displays a gradual downward trend under
the reform scenario.

CONCLUSIONS
17.

Tuvalu’s weak capacity to service debt means renewed loan disbursements are unlikely

to lead to a sustainable outcome. Even when the only new disbursements are those provided by
the development partners on IDA terms, indicators of public and publicly guaranteed external debt
stocks remain well above indicative thresholds, indicating high levels of debt distress. Tuvalu’s
revenue base (including licensing income) is relatively high, but its small export base and GDP mean
that even small disbursements result in a long-term reduction in sustainability. While stock
indicators do not rise strongly under the baseline scenario, Tuvalu’s current fiscal situation is
unsustainable, and maintaining its current level of debt service is unlikely to improve it even as it is
able later in the simulation period to take advantage of its external asset holdings.
18.

Implementation of the PRM would bring debt sustainability somewhat closer. While

debt ratios remain fragile even under the PRM scenario, a stronger fiscal position and modestly
faster GDP growth would make the current debt position more sustainable, and improve debt
dynamics.
19.

Moreover, the most damaging risks – a slowdown in GDP and a nominal depreciation–

are not low-probability events. GDP growth in Tuvalu is highly volatile and may not return to
historical levels without a significant effort to improve macroeconomic management, the business
climate and human capital. Donor assistance can help growth and resilience, by building
policymaking capacity and by supporting infrastructure investment. But a slowdown of the
magnitude presented in this scenario, while not a baseline event, cannot be ruled out. Similarly, the
current strength of the Australian dollar cannot be guaranteed: a return of the Australian dollar to
levels seen only eight years ago would cause a dangerous increase in Tuvalu’s debt ratios.

1/ Includes both public and private sector external debt.
2/ Derived as [r - g - ρ(1+g)]/(1+g+ρ+gρ) times previous period debt ratio, with r = nominal interest rate; g = real GDP growth rate, and ρ = growth rate of GDP deflator in U.S. dollar terms.
3/ Includes changes in gross foreign assets; and valuation adjustments. For projections also includes contribution from price and exchange rate changes (the hight voltility of the AUD)
4/ Assumes that PV of private sector debt is equivalent to its face value.
5/ Current-year interest payments divided by previous period debt stock.
6/ Historical averages and standard deviations are generally derived over the past 10 years, subject to data availability. Median used for current account.
7/ Defined as grants, concessional loans, and debt relief.
8/ Grant-equivalent financing includes grants provided directly to the government and through new borrowing (difference between the face value and the PV of new debt).

2/ Assumes that the interest rate on new borrowing is by 2 percentage points higher than in the baseline., while grace and maturity periods are the same as in the baseline.
3/ Exports values are assumed to remain permanently at the lower level, but the current account
as a share of GDP is assumed to return to its baseline level after the shock
(implicitly assuming an offsetting adjustment in import levels).
4/ Includes official and private transfers and FDI.
5/ Depreciation is defined as percentage decline in dollar/local currency rate, such that it never exceeds 100 percent.
6/ Applies to all stress scenarios except for A2 (less favorable financing) in which the terms on all new financing are as specified in footnote 2.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
September 4, 2012

International Monetary Fund
700 19th Street, NW
Washington, D. C. 20431 USA

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2012 Article IV Consultation with Tuvalu
On August, 5 2012, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded
the Article IV consultation with Tuvalu. 1
Background
A slow recovery is underway in Tuvalu, but there are important risks. GDP grew in 2011 for the
first time since the global financial crisis, led by the private retail sector and education spending.
We expect growth to rise slowly from 1.1 percent last year to 1.2 percent this year as the
services sector continues to grow. Falling prices for imported goods such as clothing pulled
inflation down to 0.5 percent in 2011, but the prices of domestically produced goods and
services are also broadly stable. However, falling numbers of Tuvaluan seafarers, and the
corresponding drop in their remittances, are hurting household incomes at a time when a strong
Australian dollar is increasing imports. The possibility that seafarer income both does not
recover and is not replaced by opportunities such as seasonal employment schemes is the
biggest risk to long-term sustainable growth.
Even beyond employment, Tuvalu remains exposed to the difficult global environment. Strong
performance at the Tuvalu Trust Fund (TTF) has brought closer the point where it will begin to
recapitalize the Consolidated Investment Fund (CIF). But a reversal could hurt the TTF,
depriving the government of necessary support. Proceeds from licensing and joint ventures
Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On
return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the
Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the
Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the
country's authorities. An explanation of any qualifiers used in summings up can be found here:

have improved the government’s revenue prospects, but further strengthening of the Australian
dollar could negate these gains. On the other hand, a rapid weakening of the dollar could cause
prices of imported goods to rise quickly. In the current fragile environment, this would present
serious difficulties for Tuvaluan households.
A large fiscal expansion in 2009-10 is now slowly being unwound. Expenditure rose quickly
during and after the Global Financial Crisis, nearly exhausting Tuvalu’s financing buffer, the
CIF. The deficit before grants rose to around half of GDP in 2010, but in 2012 is expected to fall
to only 10 percent, as tax compliance among private companies has improved and costs related
to various educational and medical programs have been trimmed.
The current account deficit is widening, though reserves are also rising. In 2011, the trade
deficit reached 58 percent of GDP, while remitted wages, the largest source of foreign
exchange, fell to only 8 percent of GDP. Income from Tuvalu’s large asset holdings abroad has
so far cushioned the blow, as has donor support, and the rising level of reserves.
A program to improve the management of public enterprises has shown some successes, with
improved payment culture in utilities and improved risk management at the country’s two banks.
But more work needs to be done, particularly in compliance with taxes and employee social
contributions.
Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors welcomed the resumption of economic growth in Tuvalu, but noted
downside risks stemming from continued exposure to external shocks and debt distress, in the
context of limited availability of policy levers. Against this background, Directors encouraged the
authorities to re-build fiscal buffers and accelerate structural reforms to boost medium-term
growth prospects.
Directors commended the authorities for taking measures to lower the 2012 budget deficit, but
urged further fiscal adjustment within a multi-year budget framework. They supported an
increase in the value-added tax next year, while stressing the importance of improving tax
compliance and ensuring that the new investment strategy of the Tuvalu Trust Fund does not
add undue risk. Directors also encouraged the authorities to reduce subsidies and contain
non-essential spending without compromising development goals.
Directors welcomed the adoption of a Policy Reform Matrix with focus on governance, social
programs, and macroeconomic stability. They commended plans to increase the participation of
the private sector in economic activity, and urged faster progress in operating public enterprises
on commercial terms. Directors called for policies to improve labor skills and seasonal
employment overseas. Directors also stressed the financial sector’s crucial role in fostering
growth. They noted the high level of non-performing loans in the banking system, and

3
welcomed efforts by the National Bank of Tuvalu and the Development Bank of Tuvalu to
improve credit quality.
Directors encouraged the authorities to improve the availability and quality of economic
statistics, and welcomed IMF technical assistance provided for this purpose.

Public Information Notices (PINs) form part of the IMF's efforts to promote transparency of the IMF's
views and analysis of economic developments and policies. With the consent of the country
(or countries) concerned, PINs are issued after Executive Board discussions of Article IV consultations
with member countries, of its surveillance of developments at the regional level, of post-program
monitoring, and of ex post assessments of member countries with longer-term program engagements.
PINs are also issued after Executive Board discussions of general policy matters, unless otherwise
decided by the Executive Board in a particular case. The staff report (use the free Adobe Acrobat
Reader to view this pdf file) for the 2012 Article IV Consultation with Tuvalu is also available.

Statement by Christopher Legg, Executive Director for Tuvalu
and Christopher Becker, Advisor to Executive Director
August 3, 2012
th

Tuvalu became the 187 member of the Fund in 2010 and this is the second Article IV consultation
between Staff and the authorities since that time. The authorities found the frank, constructive
discussions and the commitment of the mission team very helpful, and look forward to enduring
engagements with the Fund and other International Financial Institutions.
The main challenges facing Tuvalu concern the development needs of the country while ensuring the
sustainability of both its natural and donor-provided resources. Fund surveillance and technical
assistance play a key role in maximizing the benefits from limited endowments, and also help to catalyze
contribution to the country’s development goals by other International Financial Institutions (World
Bank, Asian Development Bank) and the broader donor community.
With a population of only around 11,000 people and annual Gross National Income of just US$50
million, this small atoll group of islands is particularly vulnerable due to its geographic isolation, lack of
fertile land, susceptibility to the impacts of climate change, and inability to reap economies of scale in
the provision of public goods and services.
1. Macroeconomic conditions
The global financial crisis spilled over into Tuvalu as slower economic activity and trade in goods
translated into less demand for Tuvaluan seafarers. The associated slowdown in remittances and economic
activity resulted in a worsening fiscal position which is now being addressed by the austerity actions of
the incumbent authorities. Financial contagion manifested itself through the adverse impact on the
principal and income from the sovereign wealth fund and is forcing the authorities to forego much needed
investment in human capital and social projects. Exchange rate appreciation has allowed inflation to
remain low and steady but has also eroded the local currency value of US dollar denominated receipts
from the sale of fishing rights and remittances. There is little capacity for Tuvalu to build policy buffers to
absorb future economic shocks given the extremity of its economic situation on a number of measures. As
a result, in the foreseeable future the country is likely to remain almost completely reliant on support from
the international community and its major donors for funds to respond to either real (including
environmental), or financial shocks.
2. Monetary and exchange rate policy
Tuvalu uses the Australian dollar as legal tender and has no central bank. As a result, it has no
independent monetary policy flexibility, no exchange rate flexibility separate from the Australian dollar,
and domestic interest rates are set based on social and development objectives by the only two banks that
operate in Tuvalu. Both of these banks are government-owned. Scope to absorb external shocks or
decouple from developments in Australia are therefore limited on the monetary side.

2
For example, while the boom in commodity prices has seen Australia’s terms of trade rise to 140 year
highs and led to significant exchange rate appreciation, the net benefit for the Tuvaluan economy, with no
mineral resources, is clearly questionable. While imports have become significantly cheaper (and there is
no export sector to speak of), the local currency value of US dollar-denominated remittances from seafarers
and proceeds from fishing licenses is also commensurately lower. The recent strength in the exchange rate
has helped keep inflation low but this positive influence could reverse quickly if the outlook for commodity
prices were to deteriorate substantially. Furthermore, the fall in the price of imports has translated into a
widening of the current account deficit and the associated depletion of foreign currency assets.
However, while noting these disadvantages, the use of the Australian dollar remains the most appropriate
exchange rate arrangement. The issue of extremely small scale (in all aspects) makes the establishment of a
modern banking system, financial markets, a central bank, let alone an independent currency, prohibitively
expensive and therefore implausible. Given that Australia is one of the largest countries in the region, its
leading role as a donor, and the lack of viable alternatives, dollarization is the least-cost option for Tuvalu.
3. Fiscal policy
Macroeconomic management and the absorption of shocks therefore largely rely on fiscal policy.
In 1988, donors capitalized an investment fund from which the income in excess of a stable real principal
is used to supplement donor assistance to fund persistent budget deficits. Following a number of years of
below-average returns and larger than usual deficits, these resources (over and above the principal) are
almost exhausted. An important policy therefore involves broadening the tax base and improving
compliance in order to finance spending on social projects. The progress made to consolidate in the most
recent budget has been difficult and unpopular but clearly highlights the authorities’ commitment to
setting the fiscal stance on a more sustainable footing. Budget support from Australia has also helped to
alleviate the pressure.
The high risk of debt distress is a particular concern considering the multifaceted vulnerabilities
confronted by the country. Grants are the only viable form of financing projects at the current juncture,
as even joint ventures with foreign private sector firms in fishing could quickly become unsustainable
if financed at commercial loan rates.
4. Structural policies
The government has an explicitly formulated development strategy to address governance, social
development, education, human resources, macroeconomic growth and stability, natural resources and
infrastructure. This plan is a useful tool for coordinating the prioritization of projects and engaging
effectively with donors. An example of difficult choices that have to be made is the recent elimination of
government-funded scholarships. Short-term budget pressures have led to the elimination of such
subsidies but this comes at the obvious longer-term cost to the development of human capital.

3
The government’s involvement in the economy is extensive and the private sector remains small,
accounting for only around ¼ of economic activity. Reform of public enterprises is therefore recognized by
the authorities as an area where efficiency gains would be beneficial. Sound governance and professional,
independent management of enterprises such as the electricity provider could limit the amount of leakage
from the public balance sheet and thus reduce the need for cuts in important spending on social projects.
Nonetheless, in a country this small almost all major service providers fulfill key social functions and are
therefore part of the policy mechanisms through which the government is able to manage economic
outcomes. The prospects for full commercialization of these enterprises are therefore limited.
An important policy to assist with the absorption of adverse shocks has been to diversify the sources of
income for Tuvaluans working abroad. Aside from the natural endowment of resources that can be
extracted from the country’s extensive maritime zone, income from Tuvaluan seafarers on international
vessels has been the other major ‘industry’ and source of income. The local currency value of this US
dollar-denominated income has been negatively impacted by the appreciation of the exchange rate and the
slowdown in international shipping. Efforts to create new and more diverse work opportunities abroad are
therefore important. Increasingly workers are branching out to take up seasonal harvesting work
opportunities in New Zealand, and more recently Australia. This diversification has helped to offset part of
the decline in remittances from seafarers and is expected to expand further in the future.
5. Other issues
Capacity problems are a major issue in almost all aspects of the economy in a microstate such as Tuvalu.
For example, there is a need to improve the quality of statistics to better inform the policy making process.
The authorities have ambitions to expand the statistics department by 30 percent (or one more person) to
deliver better quality data but the funds and skills are lacking. Currently, a single person compiles both the
National Accounts and the Balance of Payments, while the other two people in the department compile the
remaining statistics and deal with administration. PFTAC and the large donor countries have been
important in assisting capacity building, but there is scope for further development.
The government is facing major constraints in terms of the economies of scale in the provision of public
goods and services across such a small population and commensurately limited tax base. While the most
basic health services are provided domestically, most of the more complicated procedures are carried out in
Fiji. Containing the costs of these services to the government has been addressed through several measures.
The system by which patients are referred to hospitals abroad has become more closely scrutinized, patient
accommodation while abroad has been reconsidered, the entitlement for relatives to accompany patients is
now more restrictive, and patients bear part of the costs that are incurred.

4
These changes not only make a positive contribution to the sustainability of the budget, but they also
highlight the complications of interpreting income per capita in an extremely small state such as Tuvalu.
The country generates sufficient income from the sale of fishing licenses, remittances, and the donor
provided wealth fund to rank relatively highly in terms of annual income per capita (US$4,760) because
the total income numerator is shared across a very small population denominator. Nonetheless, it finds
itself in a situation where total income is so small that it proves prohibitively expensive for the government
to provide adequate health services domestically. If a substantial part of that higher income per capita
therefore has to be allocated toward expensive medical services in another country, the remaining
disposable per capita amount available for consumption and saving is significantly lower. The return
airfare from Funafuti to Suva alone is almost ¼ of the average Tuvaluan’s annual income. In this simple
illustration it is easy to recognize that assessment of welfare based on income per capita alone can be
misleading. This is especially the case in countries where vulnerabilities are relatively pronounced.
