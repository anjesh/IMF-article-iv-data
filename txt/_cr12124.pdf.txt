STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2012 ARTICLE IV CONSULTATION
April 12, 2012

KEY ISSUES
Context. Thailand is recovering from historic floods that inundated a large portion of
the country, cost lives, destroyed physical capital, and halted production in the last
quarter of 2011. Despite uncertainty about the evolution of the global economy, the
Thai economy is expected to rebound sharply. The key challenge now is to rebuild the
country, while maintaining macroeconomic stability and sowing the seeds for stronger
and more wide-spread growth.
Outlook and risks. As reconstruction picks up and investment recovers, staff projects a
V-shaped recovery with GDP growing by 5.5 percent in 2012 and 7.5 percent in 2013.
Downside risks to the outlook are significant. The Thai economy remains vulnerable to
weak growth in its trading partners. Domestically, political tensions and
underperformance of government spending on reconstruction could adversely affect
private investment.
The policy mix of monetary easing and fiscal stimulus will provide welcome support to
domestic demand in the near term, but a gradual unwinding is called for over the
medium term. The effectiveness and cost of fiscal measures should be carefully
monitored to ensure that their income redistribution objectives are achieved in an
efficient manner. Revenue-enhancing measures might be necessary to achieve these
objectives while maintaining fiscal sustainability.
The financial sector remains sound but the governance of Specialized Financial
Institutions needs to be improved.
Making growth more inclusive is a key priority of the authorities. Higher wages need
to be accompanied by increases in productivity to avoid hurting competitiveness.

2012 ARTICLE IV REPORT

THAILAND

INTRODUCTION
1.
Thailand is recovering from a very
challenging year marked by natural
disasters of historic magnitude. First, the
Japanese earthquake and tsunami affected
manufacturing output via supply chain
disruptions in 2011:Q1. Shortly after the
economy recovered, massive floods brought
the manufacturing sector to a standstill. Total
losses are estimated at about 3 percent of
GDP. On a yearly basis, GDP growth shrank
from 7.8 percent in 2010 to a barely positive
0.1 percent in 2011. However, the Thai
economy is expected to rebound sharply in
2012. Positive signs of a recovery are already
under way with sharp improvements seen in
high frequency indicators since December
2011. However, amidst uncertainty about the
evolution of the global economy and the
success of flood-prevention measures,
downside risks to the outlook are significant.
2.
Public policies are targeting income
redistribution and flood prevention. A new
government took office in August 2011 with
policy priorities geared toward making
income distribution more equal and
rebalancing growth toward domestic
consumption. In response to the devastating
floods in 2011:Q4, the government added
plans to invest in flood prevention and boost
reconstruction-led recovery. In response to
the floods and the weak external
environment, the Bank of Thailand (BOT)
halted its gradual normalization policy and
lowered the policy rate twice by a cumulative

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

50 basis points in November 2011 and
January 2012.
3.
Against this backdrop and amidst
heightened uncertainty about the global
outlook, the discussions focused on the
challenge of rebuilding the economy in the
near term, and restoring confidence while
maintaining macroeconomic and fiscal
stability and promoting inclusive growth.
The authorities and staff agreed that
expansionary fiscal policies came at an
opportune time to help offset weak world
demand. However, beyond FY 2012, the
authorities should gradually unwind the
supportive policy stance and move to a
medium-term consolidation path that is
consistent with their commitment to fiscal
sustainability. Staff advised that their
commitment to maintain sound public
finances could be usefully underpinned by
formalizing the current operational mediumterm fiscal guidelines. In addition, the
effectiveness and fiscal cost of income
redistribution policies, in particular the price
interventions in the rice market, need to be
carefully monitored while increases in labor
productivity will be necessary to maintain
competitiveness as the authorities gradually
increase minimum wages. Similarly, the BOT’s
accommodative stance is appropriately
supporting the economy but normalization
should resume once the recovery is under
way.

2012 ARTICLE IV REPORT

ECONOMIC CONTEXT
A. Macroeconomic Developments: Recovering from Negative Shocks
4.
Thailand faced unprecedented
adverse shocks in 2011. In tandem with the
region, Thailand promptly recovered from the
global financial crisis and its growth
performance remained robust till 2011:Q1.
However, natural disasters pummeled the
economy thereafter. First, the earthquake in
Japan in March disrupted supply chains and
slowed down production, albeit temporarily.
Then, the country was inundated by massive
floods that began in August and worsened in
October–November, slowing the economy to a
near halt (Figure 1). In the last quarter of 2011,
output contracted by 10.75 percent (quarteron-quarter), a larger contraction than ever
recorded, bringing annual growth down to
0.1 percent. Manufacturing industries such as
the automobile and electronics sectors were
particularly badly affected (Box 1) but
agriculture and tourism also suffered. Given
the tightness of the labor market,
unemployment remained subdued in spite of a
drop in capacity utilization as enterprises kept
employees on the payroll to avoid labor
shortages in the recovery period. For the
economy as a whole, the output gap which
had closed earlier in 2011 turned negative
again in 2011:Q4.
5.
The balance of payments surplus
narrowed. Flood-related supply-side
bottlenecks and weaker external demand
slowed exports down while the second half of
2011 saw some volatility in financial markets
prompted by the global financial turmoil.
Accordingly, the current account surplus
declined to 3.4 percent of GDP compared to
4.1 percent in 2010 and the financial account

moved to a deficit of 2 percent from a surplus
of 7.5 percent of GDP leading to a modest
increase in international reserves to 206 billion
as of the end of 2011.
6.
The relatively high inflation in 2011
has slowed down. Energy price hikes, floodrelated food shortages and accommodative
macroeconomic policy stances all played a role
in keeping prices relatively high. Headline
inflation was above 4 percent year on year
(y/y) from April through November 2011, until
falling in December to 3.5 percent as the
flood-related supply shortages abated.
Similarly, core inflation doubled from the
previous year to almost 3 percent (y/y) over
the same period, remaining close to the upper
band of the BOT’s inflation target until falling
to 2.75 percent in December.
7.
The recovery is already under way
with sharp improvements seen in high
frequency indicators since December 2011.
Manufacturing output surged in December
even though there are variations in the pace of
recovery across industries. Confidence
indicators almost reached their pre-flood
levels even though concerns of renewed floods
when the rainy season begins in June weigh on
investor sentiment.
8.
Fiscal policy is supporting recovery.
In FY2011, general government revenue
slightly increased by 0.3 percent of GDP from
FY2010 (October–September), with increases in
income and consumption taxes from the
economic recovery more than offsetting the
revenue loss from the diesel fuel excise tax cut
that was in effect since April 2011. General

will depend on how rapidly the private sector can
return to full capacity production and whether some businesses decide to relocate.

Jan-2012

As Japan is a key source of sophisticated intermediate and capital goods for Thailand (up to 92 percent
for some components), Thailand was particularly affected by the March 2011 earthquake in Japan. The
specialization and concentration of upstream manufacturers made substitution away from Japanese suppliers
difficult in the short run and most Thai firms needed to temporarily scale back production. However, the
bottle-neck impact was short-lived and production started catching up in June 2011.

boosting growth through higher consumption
and income redistribution (see Paragraph 13).
In addition, in response to the devastating
floods, the government plans to invest in
flood-prevention and provide soft loans to
help households and firms in flood-affected
areas.

B. Outlook: A V-shaped Recovery, Amidst Global Uncertainty
9.
Thailand’s near-term economic
outlook is promising. Staff projects a Vshaped recovery with full recovery of the preflood production levels in the manufacturing
and export sectors in the second half of 2012
with underlying growth expected to return to
estimated potential thereafter. GDP is
therefore projected to grow by 5.5 percent in
2012 and a further 7.5 percent in 2013 due to
a large carryover effect from the strong
recovery in the second half of 2012. Domestic

demand is expected to be the driving force of
growth in 2012 with investment increasing by
7 percent (y/y) partly due to reconstruction
and flood-prevention efforts as well as
consumption increasing by 5 percent, fuelled
by the rise in the minimum wage. The trade
balance is expected to show a deficit in
2012:H1, reflecting strong investment imports
and soft world demand. Inflation should
remain within the BOT’s target band. With the
output gap not projected to close until the

second half of the year, the large investment
projects should not add excessive inflationary
pressures. However, despite a reduction in
global commodity prices (excluding oil),
significant nominal wage increases, support for
domestic rice prices, and the impact of higher
oil prices, all represent upside risks for
inflation.

However, downside risks to the
outlook are significant. On the external front,
the Thai economy remains vulnerable to
contagion from the turmoil in the euro area,
and weak growth in its trading partners. As
Thai banks are mostly domestically funded, the
direct impact on the financial sector from a
worsening of the euro-area sovereign crisis
would be relatively limited. However, an
increase in the global aversion to risk could
lead to a sharp decline in stock markets. More
importantly, a global downturn and an abrupt
slowdown in China would hurt Thailand via

Over the medium term, potential
growth remains constrained by supply side
factors. Staff projects that potential output
could rise from around 3.5 percent in 2011 to
5 percent over the medium term if
infrastructure is improved and development
potential in lagging regions can be tapped.
While the fiscal stimulus plans may help jump
start recovery and boost domestic
consumption, these plans do not generally add
to productive capacity, underscoring the
importance of addressing supply-side factors
going forward to support medium-term
growth prospects.

lower export prospects. Domestically, political
tensions and underperformance of public
spending (in particular related to water
management) could adversely affect business
and consumer confidence, private investment,
and economic growth (for more details, see
Appendix I). If the minimum wage hike leads to
a wage increase and labor productivity does not
rise sufficiently, labor costs could rise to levels
that erode competitiveness and weaken export
growth. However, there are upside risks to the
outlook as well: if the economic performance
of advanced economies and key trading
partners is better than expected, growth would
be higher than under the baseline and
inflationary pressures would return sooner
than projected.

The authorities broadly agreed with
staff‘s outlook but were somewhat more
optimistic about domestic investment. The
authorities shared staff’s views on the global
economic environment but were less worried
about other downside risks as they expect
flood-related investment would boost
investors’ confidence and prompt a strong
recovery in private investment.

THAILAND

2012 ARTICLE IV REPORT

POLICY CHALLENGES
A. Optimizing Fiscal Policy for Growth
13.
The authorities’ near-term fiscal
policy comprises both tax reductions and
expenditure increases. On the revenue side,
measures include introducing a tax break on
first-time home and car buyers, and cutting
the corporate income tax (CIT) rate over the
next two years (from 30 percent to 23 percent
in 2012, then to 20 percent in 2013) to help
private companies deal with higher labor costs
from increases in minimum wages of about
40 percent implemented on April 2, 2012. A
previously adopted temporary reduction of the
fuel excise tax has also been extended multiple
times. On the expenditure side, the authorities
increased the starting wage of civil servants,
and granted a debt moratorium for some
low-income households (see text table below).
More recently, the flood-prevention
investments include a B 350 billion (3 percent
of GDP) off-budget package for infrastructure
investments to be implemented over three
years.
14.
Staff estimates that the combined
fiscal cost will be sizeable. On the revenue
side, staff estimates that, at current compliance
levels, the reduction in the CIT rate would
reduce revenue by about 1.2 percent of GDP in
2012 and 1.8 percent of GDP in 2013 and
thereafter. The fuel excise tax cut, if kept for a
full year, would reduce revenue by another
1 percent of GDP. The tax refund for first time
home and car buyers will erode income tax
revenue by a further 0.2 percent of GDP
beginning in FY2013. On the expenditure side,
budgeted public investment is projected to
increase in FY2012 to 3 percent of GDP (from
2.4 in the previous years) and is expected to be
maintained in FY2013. This will be augmented

with off-budget water management projects of
B 350 billion (about 3 percent of GDP), to be
carried out over FY2012–14. In addition, the
rice price guarantee scheme could increase the
public debt by 1 percent of GDP per year
through government guarantees of stateowned enterprise (SOE) borrowing (see Box 2
for details on the rice price guarantee scheme).
Under these assumptions and after taking into
account expected efforts to rationalize
spending, staff expects the general
government deficit to widen from 1.6 percent
of GDP in FY2011 to 3 percent of GDP in
FY2012. The public sector deficit, which reflects
the costs of the rice price guarantee scheme, is
expected to widen from 2.4 percent to
4.4 percent of GDP over the same period. As
the public debt level is still at a manageable
40 percent of GDP, the authorities are not
expected to face any financing difficulties

Implementation of expansionary
measures requires careful management of
fiscal space. Staff supports the authorities’
plans to improve revenue collection and boost
compliance through better use of information
technology. However, more concrete measures
may be needed to offset the impact of the tax
cuts on revenues. To keep fiscal policy on a
sustainable path, and given the pressing need
to upgrade infrastructure to support future
growth, fiscal space should be secured
through containing current expenditures and
enhancing revenue, rather than through
reducing public investment. In particular,
revenue-enhancing measures such as restoring
fuel taxes, eliminating income tax credits, and
reviewing the rate structure of excises and the
VAT should be considered. In this light, staff
welcomes the government’s intention to
reconsider cutting the CIT rate to 20 percent in
2013 if revenue underperforms in FY2012.
16.
The cost, effectiveness, and
composition of public expenditures should
be carefully monitored. The fiscal stimulus
comes at an opportune time to offset the
impact of the weaker global outlook and help
the reconstruction efforts. However, the
effectiveness of the income redistribution
policies, especially the rice price guarantee
scheme (see Box 2), needs to be carefully
monitored and changes implemented, if
necessary, to contain fiscal costs. In addition,
as growth ultimately hinges on the production
capacity of the economy, spending should be
more focused on growth-enhancing areas such
as public investment. Expediting priority public
investment will help restore market confidence
and attract private investment. It will be
particularly important to ensure that water
management projects are implemented
successfully to avoid a repetition of large-scale
flooding in the future.

2012 ARTICLE IV REPORT

17.
Moving away from fuel subsidies
will be a very positive step, when
implemented. While some energy prices are
now gradually allowed to adjust to market
prices, the diesel fuel excise tax cut has been
extended repeatedly, most recently to endApril 2012. Such tax incentives should be
allowed to expire as they are neither fiscally
sustainable, nor efficient to cope with elevated
global fuel prices. Because higher-income
households consume a disproportionate share
of energy, such untargeted measures are not
efficient in terms of income distribution
objectives either. The mission advised that the
increase in minimum wages provides a good
opportunity to fully restore the diesel excise
tax.
18.
Looking ahead, the medium-term
fiscal outlook needs to be supported by
specific policy plans. Though the cabinet
approved a budget deficit for FY2013 of
B 300 billion (2.7 percent of GDP), down from
B 400 billion in FY2012, details are yet to be
worked out. Assuming no major policy
changes, staff projects that the general
government deficit would decrease only in
FY2015 as water management projects would
be finished. The projected improvements in
the budget balance over FY2015–17 are largely
from projected improvements in revenue
administration but are not sufficient to reverse
the upward trend of public debt. While the
debt level is still well below the authorities’
official guideline of 60 percent of GDP, the
perpetuation of current policies would
gradually push the debt toward that ceiling.
The debt sustainability analysis (DSA) shows
that Thailand’s public debt has switched from
a downward trend to a modest upward one
reaching 51 percent of GDP in 2017 (see
Appendix II).

Box 2. Thailand: The Cost of Subsidizing Diesel and Guaranteeing the Rice Price
Diesel price subsidy and excise tax cut
Thailand established the Oil Fund after the first global oil shock in 1973 to protect domestic oil prices from
swings in international prices. During low oil price periods, the Fund collects a levy and accumulates reserves
that are then used to subsidize the retail price when the oil price rises above a certain level. In April 2011, after
several months of high oil prices, the Fund’s reserves were depleted and the government replaced the fuel
subsidy provided by the Oil Fund with a temporary reduction in the excise tax so as to keep retail prices under
B 30/liter. This excise tax reduction was meant to expire after a few months but has been prolonged several
times. If this excise cut is maintained for an entire year, the revenue loss from the excise tax cut would be
around 1 percent of GDP.
Rice price guarantee scheme
In October 2011, the government committed to buy rice from farmers at a price above the current market
price, with the objective of improving farmers’ income.
Mechanics of the program. The government guarantees to purchase rice at a set price. Farmers pre-register
with the Ministry of Commerce to be allowed to deliver their rice to certified millers and public warehouses.
Upon delivery of the rice, farmers obtain warehouse receipts specifying the rice quality and quantity. Farmers
then use warehouse receipts as collateral to obtain a loan from the BAAC (the Bank for Agriculture and
Agricultural Cooperatives, a specialized financial institution (SFI)). At the end of the rice season, farmers can
either sell their crop on the market or to the government. In the latter case, the repayment of the loan
becomes the responsibility of the government.

Fiscal cost. The fiscal cost of the program depends on developments in the world rice market. For the 2011–12
rice season, the government pledged to buy rice at B 15,000 per metric ton, which is 20 percent above the
current international market price. If the pledge price remains 20 percent above the market and, assuming the
amount of rice production is comparable to previous

Structural issues and incentives. In addition to fiscal sustainability issues, there is a question as to what extent
the program is effective as an income distribution policy. As the program is administratively cumbersome
(e.g., farmers need to get certificates, and bring their paddy to mills) and involves a delay between rice
delivery and loan disbursement , the smallest farmers tend to keep away from the program and sell their rice
directly to millers at a lower price or keep it for subsistence purposes. Hence the program could end up
mainly benefitting large-scale producers and middlemen. In addition, the complexity of the scheme can open
arbitrage opportunities and create governance issues.

The credibility of fiscal policy would
benefit from being set in a strengthened
institutional framework. Currently, the
government operates under a self-imposed
(but not legally binding) medium-term fiscal
target, which comprises ceilings on public debt
and debt service.1 A fiscal rule, comprising a
public debt ceiling and a medium-term fiscal
balance path consistent with those ceilings, as
prescribed in the draft Public Finance Act,
would add credibility to the government’s
commitment. A multi-year perspective would
help establish a credible fiscal path that avoids
unsustainable debt dynamics. For the fiscal
rule to be practical, it should include an escape
clause that would provide flexibility at times of
exceptional shocks. Equally important is that
the fiscal rule does not focus only on the
narrowly defined central government budget,
so that when extra spending is justified it can
be fully reflected in the budget, without
resorting to extra-budgetary expenditures,
thus increasing both transparency and
accountability. Recommendations of the 2009
fiscal Request on the Observation of Standards
and Codes (ROSC), including comparison of
budget figures to actual outturns in budget
documents, more comprehensive coverage of
extra-budgetary funds and public enterprises
in public accounts, and including a statement
of fiscal risks in budget documents, would help
improve fiscal operations and accountability. It
is also important to avoid recourse to the
central bank for financing quasi-fiscal
operations that could diminish its
independence and impair its ability to achieve
its inflation objectives.

2012 ARTICLE IV REPORT

20.
In the discussions, staff argued that
the authorities should plan on gradually
unwinding the supportive policy stance.
Acknowledging that the highly uncertain
global outlook and the need to support
domestic demand fully justify the stimulus
stance now, staff recommended that demandpromoting policies should be phased out as
the output gap closes, to allow the private
sector to adapt and avoid inflationary
pressures that would require a tighter
monetary policy stance than otherwise. If the
global economy were to deteriorate further,
automatic stabilizers, plus additional stimulus
measures, could be considered provided that a
well-defined medium-term consolidation path
is in place.
21.
Over the longer term, public
finances also are facing pressures from a
rapidly aging population. The old-age
dependency ratio of Thailand is already high
among ASEAN˗5 countries, and Thailand is
expected to face a higher speed of aging
compared to many other countries in the
region. Health care spending is expected to
rise by 1.1 percent of GDP in the next two
decades, and public pension spending is
projected to increase by 0.7 percent of GDP
over the same period.2 While the level of these
age-related expenditures in Thailand is not
particularly high by international standards,
there is likely to be pressure for improving the
coverage and quality of social protection as
income per capita increases. It is thus
important to ensure that health care and
pension programs are resilient to the
forthcoming demographic changes (Box 3).

1

The government’s medium-term fiscal target requires
that the public debt does not exceed 60 percent of
GDP and the debt service (principal and interest
payment) does not exceed 15 percent of total
expenditure.

2

The slower pace of pension spending growth reflects
the narrow coverage of the public pension plan.

Box 3. Thailand: Economic and Fiscal Implications of Demographic Change
Thailand’s population is aging relatively quickly—its old age dependency ratio is only second to
Singapore within ASEAN˗5 countries and expected to remain so for the decades to come. Within agerelated spending, increases in healthcare spending are generally the most prominent due to cost
increases from upgrades in available health services and lower productivity growth of services relative to
other sectors of the economy.
Thailand has been successful in achieving universal coverage of healthcare without an excessive increase
in public spending, partly due to relatively high economic growth during the period of coverage
expansion. Based on the age distribution projected by the United Nations and the age profile of health
spending consistent with the average for Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development
(OECD) countries, public health spending in Thailand is estimated to increase from 2.8 percent of GDP
in 2010 to 3.9 percent of GDP in 2030 (further details are provided in Appendix III).
There are multiple ways of mitigating increases in public health expenditure, including through greater
control over the range of publicly funded health services, more involvement of local governments in the
program, and greater use of market mechanisms.1 If savings from these reforms are not sufficient to
contain the increase in health spending, deeper cuts in other spending areas or additional revenue
sources may be needed. Potential source of additional revenue with a relatively low burden on the
working age population include consumption taxes (VAT), property taxes, and excise taxes.

According to a recent IMF paper, a one-unit increase in the index measuring involvement of local and regional governments in
key health care decisions reduces growth in public health spending by about 0.30 percentage points of GDP (see “Macro-Fiscal

Authorities’ views
22.
The authorities were more
optimistic about the fiscal costs of their
policies but pledged to adopt
countervailing measures if needed.
Regarding the rice price guarantee scheme,
the authorities indicated that they expect the
international rice price to increase, thereby
minimizing the fiscal costs of the policy. With
respect to the CIT, they believe that a lower CIT
rate will boost overall tax compliance,
generating enough revenue to offset the loss
from the lower tax rate. At the same time, the
authorities showed their willingness to
reconsider a further cut in the CIT rate to
20 percent in FY2013 if revenue
underperforms. They also noted that it is
desirable for an open economy like Thailand to
have its corporate tax rates competitive with
other countries, and to bring its energy price
back in line with the international market price
over the medium term.

2012 ARTICLE IV REPORT

23.
The authorities reiterated their
commitment to fiscal discipline,
underpinned by the existing medium-term
framework of ceilings on public debt and debt
service. They also stressed the importance of
maintaining public investment at a sufficient
level to support private sector activities. They
renewed their commitment to balancing the
budget over the medium term.
24.
The authorities agreed with the
need to enhance fiscal discipline and
transparency, along the lines of the 2009
fiscal ROSC recommendations. They
informed staff that the draft Public Finance
Act, which is expected to include provisions on
the medium-term fiscal framework and fiscal
transparency, is under preparation and is
expected to be submitted to parliament in the
future.

B. Supporting Stable Noninflationary Growth
25.
The current monetary policy stance
is accommodative. Monetary policy had been
on a steady normalization path since July 2010
with the policy rate having been raised by a
cumulative 225 bps. However, before a neutral
stance could be reached, the weakening
external environment and widespread floods
led the BOT to first pause in October, and then
lower the rate by a cumulative 50 bps in
November 2011 and January 2012. Real rates
are currently still negative and among the
lowest in the region.
26.
Even so, inflationary pressures
appear muted. Inflationary pressures have
been abating over the last few months due to
both domestic and external factors, including

low demand during the floods, and declining
global commodity prices (see Figure 3). Going
forward, base effects will keep inflation in the
next year relatively low, and global food prices
are expected to keep declining. The rice price
guarantee scheme does not appear to be
pushing up local rice prices yet. The planned
infrastructure spending is large, but likely to be
spread over the next two–three years and
thereby will not add much to domestic
demand pressures.
27.
If upside risks materialize,
inflationary pressures could return. While
many commodity prices are subdued, the oil
price has been rising and may rise further in
the future. As for public policies, higher

minimum wages may have limited direct pass
through to prices as the impact on companies
would be offset by lower income tax rates, but
could still boost consumption and lead to a
stronger-than-anticipated wage-price spiral.
The change in the rice price policy could also
boost food prices and farm income more than
in the baseline. A stronger-than-expected
global economy would also add to inflationary
pressures, both through higher export demand
and through higher commodity prices.
28.
Staff agreed that the BOT’s
accommodative monetary stance is
appropriate at this juncture but underlined
that once the recovery takes hold, resuming
policy normalization would be warranted.
With the output gap projected to close in the
second half of the year, resuming normalizing
policies will be needed to keep inflationary
pressures in check. Monetary policy may need
to adjust to inflationary pressures that could
stem from fiscal policy, while continually
gauging downside risks from a weaker global
economy. If energy prices are allowed to
gradually adjust to market levels, it will be
crucial to maintain policy coordination to keep

2012 ARTICLE IV REPORT

inflationary expectations well-anchored and
contain second-round effects. Should
downside risks to the central scenario
materialize, the BOT could still support the
economy by further reducing the policy rate
and letting the exchange rate adjust.
Authorities’ views
29.
The BOT agreed with staff’s
recommendation to resume the
normalization once recovery takes hold.
Even though inflationary pressures have
receded with the floods and declining
commodity prices, they recognize that the
wage and rice policies could pose inflationary
risks, particularly if the economic recovery is
stronger than expected. The BOT is
determined to remain vigilant in setting its
policy interest rate, aiming to offset excessive
demand pressures if the government’s deficit
increases further or inflation expectations
begin to rise. On the other hand, given the
uncertainty of the global environment, the BOT
is also ready to keep supporting the economy
if domestic or global conditions warrant it.

C. Managing Capital Flows
30.
In line with other emerging markets,
capital flows became markedly more
volatile and are likely to remain so in the
near future. Equity inflows were mostly flat
over 2011, owing to the tightening monetary
policy and the heightened risk aversion. Bond
inflows, on the other hand, have been very
large and volatile, reaching historic peaks at
times and reversing during periods of
heightened domestic or external uncertainty.
Looking ahead, the relatively better outlook
compared to advanced countries and
attractive yield differentials are likely to keep
channeling global liquidity toward emerging

markets. At the same time, heightened global
uncertainty is adding to the volatility in risk
perceptions and is expected to cause
intermittent stops in capital flows.
31.
The BOT has been smoothing the
exchange rate movements but the main
challenge is to prepare economic agents to
deal with higher volatility (Figure 4). The
baht exchange rate remained largely
unchanged against the dollar over 2011 as the
BOT managed external flows in both directions
but a relatively higher domestic inflation has
appreciated the baht in real effective terms by
4 percent. With capital flows turning inward

resumed, growing by $3 billion in the first two
months. Staff argued that the main challenge
is preparing economic agents as capital flow
surges and volatility are structural in nature
and smoothing measures may not have lasting
effects. Given that large and volatile inflows
may continue for a while, a sustainable
strategy would include keeping a flexible
exchange rate while encouraging wider use of
hedging instruments and preventing large
exchange rate risks from building up.
32.
Staff estimates that the exchange
rate remains broadly in line with mediumterm fundamentals. Staff underlined that
exports seem to have become more resilient to
exchange rate flexibility (see Appendix IV).
While point estimates range from a 9 percent
undervaluation to a 7 percent overvaluation,
some of these estimates are not statistically
significant and the average of the estimates is
a 3 percent undervaluation. In addition, the
strengthening of regional supply chains has
allowed the key export-oriented industries to
become less sensitive to exchange rate
movements. Hence, despite the steady
appreciation of the Thai baht in real effective
terms since 2005 (barring the global financial
crisis), Thailand’s world export share has
increased during this period.
33.
Building higher foreign currency
reserves is costly and has diminishing
benefits. At $210 billion (including the net
forward position) as of end-March 2012,
foreign currency reserves cover over
400 percent of short-term external debt,
11 months of future imports, 50 percent of
broad money supply, and are above the level
suggested by the IMF’s new risk-weighted
approach. Staff estimates that the monetary
cost of the intervention and sterilization

operations are not large at this time,
amounting to about 0.1 percent of GDP in
2011 but these costs would accumulate over
time.3
34.
With official reserves above all
standard benchmarks and the exchange
rate not overvalued, there is room for
greater two-way flexibility of the baht.
Declining terms of trade, higher imports
needed for building infrastructure and
increasing outward investment by Thai
residents are expected to diminish the balance
of payments and current account surplus over
time.4 The balance is expected to remain
positive, which will continue to exert
appreciation pressures on the baht. Continued
productivity gains in line with historical trends
would also imply a stronger baht over the
medium term.
Authorities’ views
35.
The BOT intends to continue to
allow flexibility in the exchange rate. The
authorities remain committed to keeping the
baht in line with macroeconomic fundamentals
and continue to encourage the private sector
to enhance their risk management capabilities.
They noted that they are committed to
market-based liquidity management and view

As the reserve currencies lose value against the baht,
valuation losses are incurred on these reserves.
Moreover, the instruments issued to sterilize the
monetary impact of foreign exchange purchases cost
more to the BOT than what is earned on international
reserves.

After relaxing restrictions on outward direct
investment in 2010, the authorities introduced the
Capital Account Liberalization Masterplan (CALM) in
late 2011 to further liberalize outflows reducing the
financial account surplus. Inward FDI has been very
weak, likely reflecting investors’ concerns of domestic
political risks and the adequacy of infrastructure.

sterilization costs as limited in magnitude and
offset by the benefits from smoothing
excessive volatility.
36.
Capital account liberalization will
continue. With outward direct investment
nearly fully liberalized, the authorities plan to
move on to liberalizing portfolio flows,
including by amending regulations to facilitate
portfolio investments abroad. With these

steps, the authorities aim to encourage
investment by Thai residents abroad, going
beyond the investment opportunities in the
country and balancing the pressure on the
baht from capital inflows. The authorities see
capital account liberalization also as a
necessary step toward the formation of
stronger financial ties in line with the ASEAN
Economic Community (AEC) integration
agenda.

D. Maintaining and Strengthening Financial Sector Resilience
37.
The banking sector was relatively
unaffected by the stress events of 2011 and
remains sound (Figure 5). The BOT
appropriately issued guidelines to deal with
flood-affected customers, granting grace
periods, and staff agrees that if the recovery
unfolds as planned, underlying asset quality is
expected to be relatively unaffected.5 In
general, asset performance has been steadily
improving over recent years as banks keep
healthy balance sheets including by selling
their nonperforming loans (NPLs) to asset
management companies. The BOT is
encouraging banks to be forward-looking in
determining their provisioning levels, so as to
create a countercyclical buffer against shocks
and those new requirements will further boost
banks’ resilience. Capital adequacy has been
increasing in line with global initiatives. Given
their low reliance on wholesale funding and
few off-balance sheet commitments, banks are
expected to easily meet Basel III’s capital and
liquidity requirements.
5

In October 2011, the BOT issued guidelines
temporarily allowing less stringent loan classifications
thereby allowing banks to maintain the existing credit
status of customers in flood-affected areas for 6 to 12
months. Measures banks could adopt included a grace
period on principal and interest payments, a reduction
in interest rates, and debt rescheduling.

20

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

38.
Recent initiatives related to
financial sector and capital market
development are encouraging. The
authorities have made good progress in
implementing their financial sector and capital
markets development master plans, including
by introducing a number of hedging
instruments. The BOT issued guidelines for
microfinance lending and have allowed the
presence of foreign banks to gradually
increase, with the goal of better financial
access and injecting more competition into the
system that would deepen markets. The
reforms planned toward further liberalizing
financial flows is a step toward regional
integration and will help Thai investors expand
their investment base beyond domestic
opportunities. Some areas, however, could
benefit from faster reform implementation. For
example, innovations such as currency-futures
would further deepen capital markets and
allow for easier access to hedging instruments.
In addition, Thailand got downgraded in
February 2012 by the Financial Action Task
Force (FATF) for not taking enough action to
address deficiencies in its AML/CFT regime.

While commercial banks are
financially sound and stable, the
performance of Specialized Financial
Institutions (SFIs) is more problematic
(Box 4). These institutions are involved in
government lending operations and enjoy
preferential treatment in terms of tax,
accounting, auditing and regulatory
requirements. SFIs are both owned and
supervised by the Ministry of Finance (MOF).
Having a different regulatory regime and
according SFIs special privileges contribute to
an unlevel playing field when SFIs activities
overlap with those of commercial banks.
Moreover, SFIs compare poorly with
commercial banks in terms of banking
soundness. They have higher levels of NPLs;
they are less liquid and have significantly lower
levels of capital. If standard prudential rules
were applied to SFIs, some would need to be
recapitalized. The recent World Bank Financial
Sector Assessment Program (FSAP) module
estimates such recapitalization needs at about
2 percent of GDP, mostly due to capital
requirements for the BAAC. Since the SFIs are
subject to different supervisory standards, the
financial strength of these institutions could be
weaker than suggested by the data, and the
corresponding need for capital could be
somewhat higher. In addition to past liabilities,
some government plans, such as the rice price
guarantee scheme and the debt moratorium
for farmers, are to be implemented through
SFIs and could deteriorate their balance sheets
further.

institutions. An external audit in line with best
international accounting practices is an
essential step to be able to assess and curtail
potential fiscal contingent liabilities as well as
financial risks. Payment of implicit or explicit
subsidies out of the government’s budget
would also increase the transparency of public
expenditures. The recent FSAP modular update
on the SFIs conducted by the World Bank
provides a comprehensive set of
recommendations for improving their
operations.

40.
Decisive progress should be made in
reforming the SFIs. As SFIs are a growing part
of the Thai financial system, it is crucial to
continue the reform effort by clearly
refocusing the SFIs’ activity on their core
mandate, and by applying bank supervision
standards to those that are deposit-taking

41.
Continuing to develop strong
financial safety nets is important. Starting
July 2012, the fees banks used to pay to the
Deposit Protection Agency (DPA) will be
collected by the BOT and allocated to servicing
the Financial Institutions Development Fund
(FIDF) debt (public debt deriving from the
settlement of the financial crisis in 1990s). 6 The
reallocation of banks’ contributions from the
deposit guarantee system to the servicing of
FIDF debt frees fiscal space in the near term,
even though this does not reduce the overall
interest burden for the public sector, but
curtails the DPA’s funding. Staff underlined
that the authorities should ensure that the
DPA has adequate resources, in line with best
international practice.

Under the new system, banks will start paying a levy
both on their deposits and on their non-deposit
liabilities such as bills of exchange (B/E). The fee will
also be raised from 0.4 percent to 0.47 percent for
deposits and 0.46 percent for non-deposit liabilities.
The DPA will receive 0.01 percent in contributions (as
opposed to 0.4 percent previously); the remaining 0.46
will be allocated to repaying FIDF debt.

Box 4. Thailand: Specialized Financial Institutions
Thailand has eight specialized financial institutions (SFIs).1 SFIs are government-owned, in most cases deposit-taking,
financial institutions intended to implement the government’s social and economic projects. They operate in various
sectors of the economy ranging from agriculture to housing, SMEs, and trade financing. The three largest SFIs
(Government Saving Bank (GSB), BAAC, and Government Housing Bank (GHB)) are deposit-taking institutions and
account for more than 90 percent of the total assets of the SFI sector. Their share of financial sector assets has
risen since the global crisis from 18 percent in 2008 to 22 percent in 2010, reflecting their proactive lending
activity during the crisis period when revenues were scarce and commercial banks tightened their lending standards.

While the MOF has delegated the authority to examine SFIs on an annual basis to the BOT, the overall supervision
remains with the MOF. The BOT performs on- and off-site inspections of SFIs and reports its findings to the SFIs’

Loan performance at SFIs is weak, but their portfolio is
growing. The government has indicated that major flood relief
and reconstruction help could be channeled via SFIs, in
particular the BAAC. Nonperforming loans are already
significantly larger than for the average commercial bank and
likely to rise. When bad loans are generated, SFIs lack the
experience to manage and resolve the bad loan portfolio and
are restricted in their ability to negotiate settlements.

Authorities’ views
42.
The authorities are satisfied with the
stability of the financial system. They
pledged to move forward with the financial
and capital market development master plans.
The BOT expressed confidence that Thai banks
are sufficiently capitalized and will overall not
face any difficulties in complying with Basel III
capital and liquidity requirements. The
authorities expressed some concern about the
impact of the FATF’s downgrade on financial
or trade flows, and concurred with the need to
expedite the work on the existing draft
AML/CFT legislation.
43.
They emphasized that there are
ample resources in the deposit protection
agency. They underlined that the DPA has
rapidly built resources since it was established
in 2008 and consider its current size to be
sufficient to fulfill likely needs, especially since
the deposit insurance coverage will be reduced
from B 50 million to B 1 million (per institution

per depositor) in August 2012. In addition they
underlined that full support from the
government would be available, if necessary,
to underpin the credibility of the deposit
insurance system.
44.
The need to reform the governance
of the SFIs was acknowledged. They
emphasized the usefulness of development
banks in reaching low-income groups and
minimized competition concerns in view of the
fact that that SFIs operate in specific niche
markets. However, they acknowledged the
rapid growth of some SFIs and intend to
refocus them on their core mandate. While
noting that the quasi-fiscal liabilities remain
relatively small, they will study the possibility
to enhance the supervision of the deposit
taking ones. They noted also that SFIs, which
used to be exempt from the DPA levy, will now
be subject to the same fee as commercial
banks, a measure which should contribute to
level the playing field.

E. Structural Issues: Raising Potential Growth and Reducing Income
Inequalities across Regions
45.
Discrepancies in regional income are
large and growing. Average per capita GDP
differs widely across regions; one-third of the
population (located in Bangkok and in the
Central and Eastern regions) contributes to
two-thirds of national GDP. In addition, while
there is a certain amount of income
convergence within the core regions (Bangkok
and the Central and Western regions), the
poorer regions are staying behind. Per capita
GDP is not only lower but is also growing
slower than in core regions, thereby widening
the income gap (see Appendix V). Lagging per

24

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

capita output levels are associated with lower
productivity, lower human capital, and less
investments in physical capital (Figure 6).
46.
Alleviating income inequality is at
the heart of the government’s policy. The
authorities emphasized their objective of
income redistribution through measures such
as increases in the minimum wage and support
for the rice price aiming at boosting income
among poorer segments of the population.

In the discussions, staff welcomed
the objective of making growth inclusive
and underlined that tapping
underdeveloped regions could be an
appropriate option to increase potential
growth. Staff recommends deepening capital
through technology transfers, and improving
the quality of the labor force to boost both
growth rates and living standards in the
peripheral regions. Enhanced public
infrastructure combined with better conditions
for the private sector could promote private
investments while public expenditure could
focus on developing labor skills.
48.
Labor productivity needs to rise in
tandem with wage increases to maintain
competitiveness. Large increases in the
minimum wages, if not matched by
productivity increases, could worsen the
competitiveness of the periphery regions,
affect their attractiveness, and hamper private
investment. Past country experiences show
that labor productivity needs to rise

significantly to keep regions competitive. As
low-wage regions in the periphery are also
regions with the lowest human capital, a
comprehensive growth strategy would need to
build capacity and reduce the stark differences
in human and physical capital across regions.
Authorities’ views
49.
The government argued that
increases in the minimum wage and a
higher rice price can start a virtuous growth
cycle and boost domestic demand and
growth as well as reduce social inequalities.
The authorities believe that firms will try
boosting productivity through capital
investments if labor is more expensive, and do
not expect this policy to cause unemployment
given the overall shortage of labor. They
indicated that they will adopt a gradual
approach in implementing the minimum wage
policy, to allow firms to adjust to the higher
costs over time and reduce the risk of a surge
in inflation.

STAFF APPRAISAL
50.
Amidst uncertainty about the
evolution of the global economy, the Thai
economy is expected to rebound sharply
from the impact of severe flooding in 2011.
Staff expects GDP growth to rise from
0.1 percent in 2011 to 5.5 percent in 2012 and
7.5 percent in 2013 driven by a recovery in
domestic demand and helped by supportive
monetary conditions. Over the medium term,
the estimated potential growth rate could
increase from 3.5 to 5 percent if policies can
successfully reduce supply-side constraints.
Inflation is expected to remain within the
target bands of the BOT.

26

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

51.
Risks to the outlook remain
significantly tilted to the downside and
stem from both the global economy and
domestic conditions. In line with other open
economies in the region, Thailand is being
affected by the sluggishness of the world
economy and remains vulnerable to further
shocks in its partner countries. At home, if
there were renewed political tensions or
underperformance of water management
projects, this could adversely affect private
investment and economic recovery.

THAILAND

52.
In light of the anemic global
outlook, the policy mix of monetary easing
and fiscal stimulus will be providing
welcome support to domestic demand in
the near term but a gradual unwinding is
called for over the medium term. The BOT’s
accommodative monetary stance is
appropriate at this juncture, but the
normalization policy should resume once
recovery is achieved to keep inflationary
expectations well anchored and contain credit
growth. The fiscal stimulus is equally coming at
an opportune time as the global outlook is
highly uncertain and domestic demand needs
to be supported. Beyond FY 2012, however,
the authorities should gradually unwind the
supportive policy stance and move to a
medium-term consolidation path that is
consistent with their commitment to fiscal
sustainability.
53.
In addition to flood-prevention
investment and recovery-related
expenditures, the new government strives
to promote inclusive growth. The
government’s program aims at rebalancing
income distribution through higher minimum
wages and rice prices. Narrowing the income
gap is a laudable objective, but it needs to be
accompanied by higher labor productivity to
maintain competitiveness. Hence, the gradual
approach to implementing the minimum wage
policy is appropriate. The rice price guarantee
scheme may not benefit the farmers that are
most in need and may impose potentially
sizable costs, both explicit and implicit, to the
budget. The cost and effectiveness of this
policy should be carefully monitored.
54.
The government’s commitment to
fiscal prudence is welcome but should be
augmented with concrete measures. Given
the pressing need to upgrade the

2012 ARTICLE IV REPORT

infrastructure that are crucial for boosting
trend growth, fiscal space should be secured
through containing current expenditures and
enhancing revenue, rather than through
reducing public investment. Strengthening
revenue administration through better use of
information technology is appropriate to
improve revenue collection and boost
compliance. Revenue-enhancing measures
such as eliminating income tax credits and
reviewing the rate structure of excise taxes and
VAT may also need to be added to the policy
arsenal to maintain adequate public services
and investment.
55.
The resilience of fiscal policy would
benefit from being set in a strengthened
institutional framework. A fiscal rule, based
on a public debt ceiling and a medium-term
fiscal path consistent with that ceiling such as
envisaged in the authorities’ draft Public
Finance Act, would add credibility to the
government’s commitment. A multi-year
perspective would help establish a credible
fiscal path that avoids unsustainable debt
dynamics. The sustainability of fiscal policy
would also be improved by more transparency
and accountability of fiscal operations in line
with the recommendations of the 2009 fiscal
ROSC, including through comparison of
budget figures to actual outturns in budget
documents as well as more comprehensive
coverage of extra-budgetary funds and public
enterprises.
56.
The banking sector remains sound
and the measures to strengthen its
resilience are commendable. Banks have
weathered well the stress events in 2011 and
the slowdown in economic activity. Looking
ahead, the banking sector’s activity is expected
to pick up with the recovery, and banks’ profit
margins are likely to remain comfortable. The

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

27

2012 ARTICLE IV REPORT

THAILAND

BOT’s guidelines for commercial banks to deal
with flood-affected borrowers are appropriate
and if the recovery unfolds as planned, asset
quality is expected to be relatively unaffected.
In addition, the new enhanced provisioning
requirements will further boost the banks’
resilience. The authorities should ensure that
the deposit guarantee scheme has adequate
resources, in line with best international
practice.
57.
Reforms to nonbank SFIs need to be
pursued to limit fiscal risks. The decision to
subject SFIs to a levy on their deposit base
equivalent to what commercial banks pay is a
welcome step toward leveling the playing field.
As SFIs are a growing part of the Thai financial
system, it is crucial to continue the reform
effort by clearly refocusing their activity to
their core mandate, and by applying more
comprehensive bank supervision standards to
deposit-taking ones. An external audit in line
with best international accounting practices
would help to assess and curtail potential fiscal
contingent liabilities as well as financial risks.

Reforms planned for the financial
sector, capital markets, and capital account
liberalization are encouraging and
welcome. The authorities have made good
progress on their financial sector and capital

markets development master plans, injecting
more competition in the banking system,
introducing a number of hedging instruments
and deepening markets. The reforms planned
toward further liberalizing financial flows is a
step toward regional integration and will help
Thai investors expand their investment base
beyond domestic opportunities.
59.
Addressing deficiencies identified by
the FATF has gained urgency. The authorities
need to amend the legislation to address the
financing of terrorism issues identified in the
action plan and to improve AML/CFT
supervision of regulated entities as early as
possible.
60.
With trend growth expected to stay
around 5 percent over the medium term,
strong efforts to increase productivity
would be needed to boost growth. Tapping
underdeveloped regions, thereby spreading
growth geographically across the nation would
raise productive capacity. Staff recommends a
comprehensive growth strategy that would
build capacity including by investing in human
and physical capital particularly in regions that
do not have a direct access to trade routes.
61.
It is recommended that the next Article
IV consultation take place on the standard 12month cycle.

Appendix II: Thailand––Public and External Debt Sustainability

A. Public Debt Sustainability
1.
Thailand’s public debt is at a turning
point from a downward trend to an upward
one. In percent of GDP it has been on a
downward trend except for a sharp increase in
FY2009, but is expected to increase to
44 percent in FY2012. It is pushed up by
2 percentage points due to low GDP growth,
lower government revenue from corporate
income tax rate reduction and a fuel excise tax
cut, as well as additional borrowing for water
management projects and government
guarantees for SOE borrowing to implement
the rice price guarantee scheme. Announced
revenue policy will further reduce government
revenue until FY2014, and current expenditure
will stay at around the level of FY2012. While
public investment is expected to fall as water
management projects come to completion in
FY2014, the saving from this is not enough to
offset the revenue loss. Under these
assumptions, the public debt path would be
on upward trend, with the ratio reaching
51 percent at the end of the projection period.
Within the overall public debt, direct
government debt would increase by
3 percentage points from FY2012 to FY2017,
while the public enterprise debt would
increase by 4 percentage points during the
same period.
2.
This profile is relatively resilient to
interest rate shocks and exchange rate
shocks. With the stable interest rates in the
past and very little debt owed externally,
shocks to interest and exchange rates make
only modest differences to the medium-term
forecast.

combination shock. If the primary balance
records an average deficit of 3 percent of GDP
over the forecast horizon, instead of averaging
1.5 percent as assumed, then by 2017 the
debt/GDP ratio would be 7 percentage points
higher than in the baseline. A combined shock,
in which the real interest rate, growth rate, and
primary balance are permanently worse than
under the baseline by one-quarter standard
deviation, would also increase the debt/GDP
ratio by 6 percentage points.
4.
A contingent liabilities shock would
generate a large deviation from the
baseline. That is, if 10 percent of GDP in
contingent liabilities are brought on budget in
2013, then even by 2017 the debt to GDP ratio
would still remain 9 percentage points higher
than in the baseline.
5.
The most significant risk to the debt
outlook comes from a potential slowdown
in growth. Under the baseline scenario,
growth is forecast to average around
5.5 percent over the medium term,
1 percentage point above the historical
average. But the standard deviation of growth
in Thailand is reasonably high. So, if growth
proved lower than assumed by one-half a
standard deviation, then the growth rate
would average just 3.5 percent, and this in turn
would push up the debt/GDP ratio by
10 percentage points.

3.
A more sizeable impact would come
from shocks to the primary balance, or a

6.
While public debt levels are still
modest and generally contained, these
scenarios suggest proactive actions are

needed for Thailand’s public debt path to
remain sustainable and resilient to shocks.

B. External Debt Sustainability
7.
Thailand’s external debt is projected
to remain low and stable over the medium
term. External debt amounted to $107 billion
at the end of 2011 (28 percent of GDP), up by
$6 billion (3.5 percent of GDP) from the
previous year. The small increase over 2011
came from long-term general government
borrowing, and the nonbank corporate and
financial sectors. The increase also represented
a lengthening of maturities, as short-term debt
outstanding fell marginally and long-term debt
rose. Going forward, Thailand’s external debt is
expected to first rise in 2012 to 32 percent of
GDP, reflecting the financing needs of the
government for the large scale infrastructure
projects. Beyond 2012, external debt is
projected to continue to rise, albeit at a slower
pace than national income, thus declining from
32 percent back to 28 percent by 2017.
8.
External debt trajectories appear
broadly stable under macroeconomic
shocks based on historical levels. The shock
levels in the stress tests are based on 10-year
historical standard deviations, and thus
represent “plausible,” rather than
“extraordinary” permanent shocks (see
Figure A2 for the shock values). Under such
plausible scenarios, a slowdown in the
economic growth rate or a rise in the external
interest rate does not cause a large deviation

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

in the external debt outlook for Thailand. A
permanent one-half standard deviation shock
to the non-interest current account balance
has a relatively larger impact, raising external
debt by 9 percentage points above the
baseline by 2017 to 37 percent of GDP.
Similarly, a combination of shocks such that
the external interest rate, the non-interest
current account balance, and economic growth
all deviate from the baseline by a one-quarter
standard deviation; external debt would rise by
6 percentage points from the baseline by the
end of the medium term to 37 percent of GDP.
9.
A large depreciation of the real
exchange rate would have a larger impact
on external debt. A real depreciation of
30 percent in 2012, which is equivalent to
about a 34 percent nominal depreciation,
would simultaneously raise the debt ratio by
about 20 percentage points. However, this
analysis excludes the adjustment that trade
flows would have if such a depreciation were
to occur, such as a sharp improvement in the
current account that would––after the initial
rise––bring the debt ratio back down
significantly over the medium term.
10.
Overall, Thailand’s external debt
remains stable under all reasonable stress
scenarios.

Appendix III: Thailand––Health Care Spending – Implications of Demographic Change1

A. Why Demographic change matters for Thailand?
Thailand has a rapidly aging population –
among ASEAN-5 countries, its old age
dependency ratio is the second highest only
after Singapore, and will remain so in 2050
(Figure 1). While the high dependency ratio
reflects longer life expectancy thanks to
improved nutrition and health conditions, an

aging population generally means a higher
fiscal burden to support the elderly with
revenues from less dynamic economic
activities. It is thus highly advisable for
Thailand to prepare for the future increase
in age-related spending.

B. Why Focus on Health Care Spending?
Two major items of age-related spending
are pension benefits and health care
spending. Increases in public expenditure on
pensions are in general modest relative to
that in health care spending, partly
reflecting significant reforms that have
already been accomplished in many
countries. In the case of Thailand, pensions
cover only 10 million members in the formal
sector and 2 million civil servants, out of
60 million people. Though it was proposed
to set up a national saving fund to extend
persion benefits to those who are not
covered by the current scheme, details of
the scheme are still under consideration.
Allowances for old age people, which could
be characterised as pension benefits, are
also at a low level (B 500 per month). Health

care spending, in contrast, is subject to cost
increase due to upgrades in available health
services and lower productivity growth of
services relative to other sectors of the
economy.

C. Overview of the Public Health Care System in Thailand
There are four main health care options in
Thailand: i) the Universal Coverage Scheme
(UCS); ii) the Civil Servants Medical Benefits
Scheme (CSMBS); iii) the Social Security
Scheme (SSS); and iv) private insurance. UCS
and CSMBS are mainly financed by tax, and
SSS is financed through compulsory
1.5 percent payroll contributions
respectively by employers, employees, and
the government. Private insurance is
voluntary and entirely financed through

private and employer contributions. By
2007, 98 percent of the population is
estimated to be covered by formal
insurance, completing the near universal
coverage.
The experience of Thailand in achieving the
universal coverage of health care is widely
seen as a success. The proportion of people

facing catastrophic health expenditures has
decreased from 5.4 percent in 2000 to
2.0 percent in 2006, which is estimated to
have brought at least 1 million Thais out of
poverty. And this was achieved without an

excessive increase in public health spending
(which increased from 1.9 percent of GDP in
2000 to 2.7 percent in 2007), partly due to
relatively stable economic growth during
this period.

Thailand: Age Distribution of the Population
(Ratio of total)

<5

Generally, health care spending tends to rise
as a share of GDP as countries develop. In
addition, elderly people consume on
average more health services than their
younger counterparts. Non age-related
increase in health spending as a share of
GDP is known as excess cost growth (ECG).
ECG is attributable to factors such as rising
incomes, technological advances, and the
relatively low productivity growth of services
relative to other sectors of the economy (the
Baumol effect). For Thailand, limited
historical data on health care spending
makes it difficult to estimate a country
specific ECG. In this note, projections of
future health care spending will be based on
a common ECG of 1.0 percent, which is
consistent with the average ECG observed
for emerging economies (IMF, 2010). The
projections incorporate spending profile by
age group as well as expected changes in
the age structure of the population.

2030. The age profile of per capita public
health spending in 2010 is assumed to be
the same as the average for OECD countries,
and to shift to the right by half a year every
10 years to reflect gains in longevity being
spent in good health.

To illustrate the impact of aging, public
health spending in 2030 (=PHE(2030)) can
be described in the following formula:
PHE(2030) = PHE(2010) * [P(0-5,
2030)*W(0-5, 2030) + P(6-10,
2030)*W(6-10, 2030) + … + P(95+,
2030)*W(95+, 2030)] / [P(0-5,
2010)*W(0-5, 2010) + P(6-10,
2010)*W(6-10, 2010) + … + P(95+,
2010)*W(95+, 2010)]
where P(i, t) stands for the share of
population of age i at time t, and W(i, t)
stands for the ratio of per capita health
spending of the population of age I to the
per capita spending of the population age
30–35.
By using age profile of health spending and
age distribution in the table above,
PHE(2030) = 2.8*(6*1.3 + 6.6*1.4 + … +
0*4.5)/(7.1*1.3 + 6.7*1.5 + … + 0*4.4) =
3.2
That is, demographic changes are expected
to increase public health spending by
0.4 percentage points of GDP by 2030.
For non age-related increase in health care
spending, we assume ECG of 1.0 percent
per year, which reflects the average of

emerging economies. Then, the public
health care spending in 2030 can be
depicted as:
PHE(2030) =
PHE(2010)*((1+ECG)^(2030-2010)) = 3.4
The combined impact of demographic and
nondemographic factors is larger than the
sum of their individual effects due to the
interaction between each of them. To take
into account this combined impact,
demographic effect (=0.6 percentage point
of GDP increase in 20 years) needs to be
annualized at 0.73 percent a year. Then the
combined impact can be derived by the
equation below:
PHE(2030) = PHE(2010)*((1 + annualized
demographic impact + ECG)^(20302010))
= 2.8*(1+0.0073+0.01) ^20
= 3.9
Put in another way, public health spending
in Thailand is estimated to increase by
1.1 percentage points of GDP by 2030. Out
of this increase, 0.4 (38 percent) is due to
pure demographic changes, 0.6 (54 percent)
is due to excess cost growth
(nondemographic changes), and the residual

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

45

2012 ARTICLE IV REPORT

THAILAND

(8 percent) is due to the interaction between
the two factors.
(3) Calibration of projection results
The results of the above projection should
be naturally interpreted with some margins.
Here are some calibrations.
i)

Different scenario of demographic
changes
The baseline projections assume
that the fertility rate will converge
eventually toward a level of 1.85
children per woman. If we assume
instead a fertility rate that is
0.5 children below the baseline,
increase in health care spending in
2030 will be higher by
0.1 percentage points of GDP.

ii) Differences in ECG
If ECG turns out to be higher than
the assumption in the baseline
projection (1.5 instead of 1.0), public
health spending in 2030 will be

4.3 percent of GDP. On the other
hand, if ECG is lower at 0.5, public
health spending in 2030 will remain
relatively benign at 3.5 percent of
GDP.
iii) Expansion of public health benefits
The baseline projections are based
on the initial health care spending in
2010 taking into account gradual
improvements in medical services
provided over the period. If, instead
of such gradual changes, the
government decides to adopt a
large expansion of the social health
benefits, which could have a
significant impact on the end result.
For example, if the initial level of
health spending is higher by
0.5 percent of GDP (as might result
from the recent efforts by the
government to scale up social
welfare programs), the projected
public health spending in 2030 will
reach 4.7 percent of GDP.

E. Policy implication
(1) Measures to mitigate increase in
health spending
How can policymakers prepare for the
possible increase in health care spending?
There are very limited, if any, policy tools to
affect demographic changes. The types of
reforms that would help improve
performance of the health care system
include the following:
i)

46

Greater control over the range of
publicly funded services
Greater control over physician
numbers and hospital activities can
be exerted, or more emphasis can
be put on affordability when

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

deciding on the publicly funded
benefit package.
ii) More involvement of local
governments in policy decisions
Local governments can be involved
in a number of health policy
decisions to exert more down-tothe-earth scrutiny.
iii) Use of market mechanisms
Greater freedom can be allowed for
insurers to vary the scope, premium
etc. for basic insurance packages
and in negotiating with health
providers. The degree of user choice
over insurers can also be increased.

THAILAND

iv) Budget caps
Ultimately, budget caps can be
introduced on spending for the
entire health sector or specific health
services.
(2) Possible source of financing for
additional health spending
The level of government revenue and its
structure varies a lot across countries, and
theory provides little practical guidance on
how best to finance increases in health
spending. Empirical studies suggest,
however, that broad-based consumption
taxes and property taxes are less harmful to
growth than income taxes.

2012 ARTICLE IV REPORT

Consumption taxes and property taxes are
important potential sources of financing,
especially in view of the relatively low rate of
VAT and ongoing discussions over
introduction of land taxes in Thailand.
Relying on income taxes for financing the
need would put a further burden on the
working-age population as the old-age
dependency ratio increases, holding back
growth potential of the economy. Excise
taxes and social contributions are less
distortionary to growth, and could be
explored as alternative sources of financing.

Appendix IV: Thailand––External Sustainability and Competitiveness Assessment1

A. External Sector Assessment
There is no sign of any major external imbalances for Thailand. The current account (CA) has
room to decline from its current level given the large investment needs of the country, and
projections based on current policy plans are in line with this assessment. Continuing to
liberalize investment abroad would balance foreign capital inflows, and international reserves
are more than adequate for supporting two-way flexibility of the baht while still providing
scope for smoothing excessive volatility. External debt and net foreign asset (NFA) positions
are stable (see Appendix 2 for a detailed assessment of external debt sustainability).
Thailand – Summary External Sector Assessment
Current account(CA)
Thailand’s CA has been
quite volatile over the last
decade, ranging from a
4¼ percent deficit to a
8¼ percent surplus,
against the backdrop of a
relatively stable trend real
appreciation and volatile
economic fundamentals.
The CA surplus came
down sharply from its
peak in 2009 at
8¼ percent to
3 ½ percent in 2011 and
is expected to decline
further to about 1 percent
over the medium term, as
large investment projects
raise imports and the
baht continues to
appreciate in real terms.

Real exchange rate
(RER)
A number of
methodologies suggest
that the Thai baht is
modestly (0–9 percent)
below the equilibrium
level (see Section B for
details).

Capital account: flows
and measures

FX Intervention and
Reserves

Foreign Asset/liability
Position

While capital flows to
banks reflect mostly
hedging activities of the
trade sector and therefore
follow the trade balance,
portfolio flows are driven
by global push factors as
well as the relatively
better fundamentals of
the Thai economy
compared to advanced
economies.

At 60 percent of GDP,
over three times the IMF’s
composite metric and
four times short-term
external debt, Thailand’s
gross reserves are more
than adequate. Thailand
also has a large forward
FX position (almost
10 percent of GDP at end2011), which increased
through 2011.
Intervention has
smoothed volatility but
sterilization costs have
increased.

NFA had been rising
steadily (in percent of
GDP) from the large
deficit it hit following the
Asian crisis until 2010,
when large inflows of
direct and portfolio
investment raised foreign
liabilities and reversed
NFA back down to -11
percent.

Portfolio inflows are
expected to continue,
though will increasingly
be offset by outward
investment as the
authorities push forward
with their financial
account liberalization
plans.

There is room for twoway flexibility, and no
need for building higher
reserves for precautionary
purposes.

Given Thailand’s need for
higher investment, a
decline in the CA balance
from its long-run average
of 2½ percent by
3-5 percentage points is
appropriate.

remain broadly stable as
foreign assets rise in line
with further liberalization
and foreign liabilities rise
with continued capital
inflows.

2012 ARTICLE IV REPORT

B. Real Exchange Rate Assessment
A combination of methodologies suggests that the Thai baht is between 0 to 9 percent below
the equilibrium level. While point estimates range from a 9 percent undervalution to a
7 percent overvaluation, some of these estimates are not statistically significant. The average
of point estimates is a 3 percent undervaluation.
Estimating an equilibrium real
exchange rate: Compared with an
equilibrium level of the real exchange
rate (RER) that is estimated from a set of
economic fundamentals that include the
terms of trade, relative productivity in
the tradable versus nontradable sectors
compared to trading partners, and
government consumption relative to
trading partners, Thailand’s RER
assessment has remained sufficiently
close to equilibrium. The actual RER is
within a 95 percent confidence interval
of the estimated equilibrium RER in the
past, and going forward, a change
between -5 percent to 19 percent, with a
mean of 7 percent, is estimated to be
sufficient to maintain a path in line with
economic fundamentals.



fundamentals such as dependency ratio,
income growth relative to trading
partners, fiscal positions vis-à-vis trading
partners and net foreign assets.
According to this estimate, the CA has
been above the equilibrium level since
2006. Going forward, the CA is expected
to decline mainly due to the large
infrastructure investment projects that
will require higher imports. Given this
declining path, the CA is expected to
approach the norm by the end of the
medium term, though there is room for
RER appreciation by ¼ to 18 percent,
with a mean of 9 percent, to bring the
CA within the confidence interval to
equilibrium.

Maintaining stable NFA: Another way
to assess external sustainability is to
compute the level of the current account

nearly turning positive in 2009, the NFA
position declined back to -11½ percent
in 2010 as large inflows of direct and
portfolio investment raised foreign
liabilities. Over the medium term, if the
authorities push forward with their
capital account liberalization plans,
foreign assets may rise along with
foreign liabilities as capital inflows to
Thailand continue, which would also
stabilize the NFA position. If the NFA
level were to stabilize at the 2010 level
of -11½ percent, the CA would need to
be about -1 percent and a RER
appreciation of about 5 could attain that
range over the medium term.

Thailand’s external competitiveness relative to the region remains broadly unchanged.
Labor productivity is relatively unchanged.
Labor productivity has steadily increased over
the past decade until the global financial
crisis. The drop in productivity experienced
over 2009 because of the crisis was fully
reversed in 2010. These changes have left
Thailand’s labor productivity relatively
unchanged compared to other regional
economies, although it fares poorly in an
international comparison.

Thailand’s exports have steadily gained market
share during this time.
Thailand’s exports have continued to steadily
gain market share over the last decade, driven
mainly by the vertical trade integration across
Asian economies. (See IMF Regional Economic
Outlook: Asia and Pacific, April 2011.) That this
occurred in spite of the baht’s considerable
appreciation during the same period is not
surprising: the forming of supply chains has
meant that exports of these sectors are less
sensitive to real exchange rate changes and
depend more on foreign demand. Therefore
one would expect a real appreciation to not
necessarily lead to a loss of export shares.

Even though unit labor costs have risen,
wages in Thailand are among the lowest in
the region nonetheless, both in absolute and
in purchasing power terms. While direct
comparison of unit labor costs across
countries is constrained by data limitations,
this suggests that Thailand is still competitive.

Appendix V: Regional Disparities in Thailand––When Average National Growth is not
Enough
This analytical note examines income disparities and growth performances across regions in
Thailand. It shows that the income gap between rich and poor regions is large by international
standards and widening at the national level. However, while some regions are lagging behind,
there are also successful convergence stories. Differences in labor quality and productivity as well as
lower capital investment partly explain the disparities in terms of economic growth. Policies that
boost the quality of labor and the level of investment would help boost the country’s potential.

A. Introduction
1.
Over the past three decades,
Thailand has enjoyed remarkable growth
rates, making it one of the fastest growing
economies. While trend growth has slowed
down since the Asian crisis, the Thai economy
remains resilient as illustrated by its rapid
bounce-back after the 2008 global financial
crisis. Yet, regional income disparities remain
substantial. The benefits of growth have been
concentrated in Thailand’s richer regions
leaving some of the poorer ones lagging
behind. As Thailand’s poorest regions are also

the most populous, the concern is that unless
these regions catch up in terms of growth and
income, a large proportion of the population
will be left in poverty and that rising inequality
could bring social, political, and economic
difficulties. Moreover, boosting output growth
in lagging regions could help raising trend
growth at the national level. Some regions
from the periphery have shown promising
above-the-national-average growth rates
which, if the patterns could be reproduced,
would help promote more balanced growth.

B. Mixed Record in Terms of Economic Convergence
2.
Thailand’s economy has been
expanding at a robust pace over the last
three decades. In the pre-1997 period, the
economy grew by an impressive average
annual rate of GDP per capita of 7.5 percent. It
slowed down in the aftermath of the crisis but
remained roughly in line with other fastgrowing emerging market economies.
3.
The disparity in economic conditions
across Thai regions is large. Thailand can be
subdivided in seven administrative regions1

Thailand is variably divided into different sets of
regions, the most notable of which are the six-region
grouping used in geographic studies (Northern,
Northeastern, Western, Central, Eastern and Southern),

(including Bangkok) with large differences in
economic activity, income, and population. The
three richest regions accounts for 70 percent
of total output but only 30 percent of the
population while the most populous region
(Northeastern) accounts also for a third of the
country’s population but its inhabitants share
less than 10 percent of the country’s income
(see text table). The export-oriented
manufacturing sector is concentrated in
Bangkok and the central region, while the
North and Northeastern regions are
predominantly agricultural. The income
disparities between regions are large by
international standards. The ratio of per capita
GDP between Bangkok and the Northeastern
region was 9.6 on average over the 2000–09
period. By comparison, the ratio of the highest
to the lowest regional per capita GDP was
8.65 in China (Fleisher, Li and Zhao, 2010),
4.5 in India (Purfield, 2006) and only 1.3 in the
United States (Bureau of Statistics, current
website).

Regional inequality is also
associated with poverty. According to
Thailand’s household surveys,2 poverty has
continuously declined from around
33.8 percent in 1988 to 9.0 percent in 2008.
(Bird and al., 2011). However, the aggregate

2012 ARTICLE IV REPORT

poverty figure masks considerable differences
in the incidence of poverty across regions.
Poorer regions are unsurprisingly also the ones
with the largest poverty incidence.3 Very low
rates of poverty are recorded in regions with
high per capita incomes such as Bangkok and
the Central region. The highest rates of
poverty are recorded in the Northeast, and to
a lesser extent in the Northern and Southern
regions.

Evidence on economic convergence
is mixed. At the national level, the gap in per
capita income between the richer and the
poorer states has widened over the past three
decades. Except during the Asian crisis and the
2009 global financial crisis, the coefficient of
variation4 of regional GDP is increasing.5 Per
capita income in richer regions has grown
almost three times faster than in the poorest
3

Household surveys consistently show that the poor
are overrepresented in the agriculture sector. Lowincome families and poor families are heavily
concentrated in agriculture, with almost 90 percent of
the poor residing in rural areas.
4

The coefficient of variation is calculated as the
standard deviation of regional per capita GDP to the
mean. An increase in the coefficient indicates a
divergence between incomes.
5

2

Household surveys are conducted in Thailand every
two years since 1988.

The income convergence during crisis times is just
the result of a larger but temporary income loss in
Bangkok during the crisis as the region is more
affected by international conditions.

regions indicating a divergence across regions
at the national level. However, while there is no
income convergence at the national level, we
can see convergence among relatively more
central regions. The central and eastern
regions have grown faster than Bangkok since
the beginning of the 1990’s and their income
is therefore catching up. Conversely, the four
poorest regions not only have a lower GDP per
capita but their growth rates are also lower
than the national average thereby widening
the gap.

C. Inequalities in Growth Factors
6.
Lagging GDP per capita levels in the
poorer regions are associated with lower
productivity. While labor utilization rates are
almost identical across the whole kingdom
with full employment in all regions, there are
stark differences in labor productivity. Labor
productivity is markedly higher in Bangkok
than in the rest of the country and the poorest
regions have the lowest productivity rates.
While differences in hourly productivity levels
could reflect difference in the industry
structures across regions, this discrepancy
remains within each sector if we look at
disaggregated sectoral data. For example,
hourly manufacturing output is almost
54

The differences in productivity are
mirrored by disparities in labor quality. The
share of skilled workers in the labor force as
defined by the share of workers with an
education level of high school or higher
follows a familiar regional pattern.

Large disparities of skills…

8.
Lagging regions receive less
investment. Private capital accumulation
(proxied by data on new investment permits
delivered by the board of investment) is very
unequal and reveals a strong preference for
Bangkok. Over the 1995–2010 period, the
Northeastern region has received about 10
times less private investment than Bangkok.
This disparity is mirrored in the allocation of
public infrastructure expenditure Bank of
Thailand (BOT, 2011).

9.
Geography and infrastructure are
key factors explaining economic
convergence. The central and eastern regions
that are catching up with Bangkok benefit
from the relative proximity to the capital and
the strategic location on trade and export
routes. Regions in the periphery are more
difficult to access and benefit from less
performing logistics and infrastructure.

D. Policies
10.
Economic growth alone has been
insufficient to promote economic
convergence across all regions. Regions in
the periphery are lagging behind in terms of
growth rates and income. They don’t benefit
from the proximity to the capital and to trade
and export routs, and infrastructure
development is also lagging. Policies aiming to
boost both growth rates and living standards
in the peripheral regions need to supplement
economic growth. Policies should target
deepening capital through technology

56

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

transfer, and improving the quality of the labor
force. As poorer regions in the periphery are
also regions with the lowest human capital and
less physical investment, a comprehensive
growth strategy would need to build capacity
and reduce the stark differences in human and
physical capital across regions. Enhanced
public infrastructure combined with better
conditions for the private sector could
promote private investment while public
expenditure could focus on developing labor
skills.

Last Article IV Consultation:

At the conclusion of the 2010 Article IV
consultations, Executive Directors observed
that Thailand has made a remarkable
comeback from the effects of the global crisis
and the period of domestic political turmoil.
They welcomed the authorities’ forceful policy
response that enabled the export recovery to
feed through into renewed domestic demand.
They discussed the challenge of normalizing
the policy stance, while ensuring that the
recovery takes firm hold despite an uncertain
global environment. They supported the
government’s plan to gradually scale back the
fiscal stimulus and welcomed the Bank of
Thailand’s decision to start raising interest
rates. Directors noted that, with the economy
recovering rapidly, capital inflows could

THAILAND

complicate policymaking. They broadly agreed
that, in such circumstances, the exchange rate
should be allowed to serve as a buffer. For the
medium term, Directors supported the
authorities’ ambitious reform agenda aimed at
strengthening infrastructure and developing
the financial sector to help restore economic
dynamism and raise growth potential. At the
same time, they called for swift action to
mitigate risks from government-owned
specialized financial institutions by improving
their risk assessment standards, strengthening
supervision, and defining their role more
clearly.

A country partnership strategy (CPS), 2007–11
between the government and the AsDB was
approved in 2007, and the government
resumed borrowing from the AsDB in 2009,

partnership in the existing CPS remain to
promote long-term, sustainable economic
growth and social development.
In 2010, AsDB supported government efforts
to improve the environment for public–private

ANNEX IV. THAILAND—STATISTICAL ISSUES
(As of March 2012)
I. Assessment of Data Adequacy for Surveillance
General: Data provision is broadly adequate for surveillance. The authorities have continued to
improve the quality and coverage of data, but dissemination of additional data would enhance
the basis for macroeconomic policy analysis, particularly in the fiscal sector.
National accounts: The national accounts are broadly in line with the 1968 SNA, but are in the
process of being updated to the 1993 SNA. While data coverage and methodology have
improved, statistical discrepancies can be reduced further.
Price statistics: The Bank of Thailand (BOT) publishes monthly price statistics and quarterly
inflation reports with sufficient coverage for surveillance.
Government finance statistics: The authorities provide data to the Fund consistent with the
Government Finance Statistics Manual, 2001 (GFSM 2001). Data are contributed to both the
Government Finance Statistics Yearbook and the International Finance Statistics. However,
general government fiscal data are only provided annually and more timely publication is
desirable. In addition, GFSM 2001-based data are not available for the state enterprises, so the
public sector balance is imperfectly calculated in GFSM 2001-basis. Given the growing
importance of state enterprises having timely data on their operations is desirable for more
effective surveillance. General government debt, including an amortization schedule, is not
available either, and is desirable for more effective surveillance.
Monetary statistics: The authorities submit the Standardized Reporting Forms (SRFs) for
monetary statistics on a timely basis.
Balance of payments: The authorities started publishing balance of payments statistics under
BPM6 in February 2012. The historical data goes back to 2005, and a longer historical time
series is desirable for analysis. The methodology for compiling balance of payments data
remains adequate, but the large errors and omissions, both under BPM5 and BPM6, point to
weaknesses in data collection, including incomplete coverage of nonbank transactions in
services trade. There is a long lag in the dissemination of IIP data, which is available only on an
annual basis. The last observation available is 2010. Data on external debt and debt service have
significantly improved since the introduction of a quarterly survey of private nonbank external
debt. However, the breakdown of debt service along the lines of external debt stocks and an
amortization schedule of external debt would allow for more effective surveillance.

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2012 Article IV Consultation with
Thailand
On April 27, 2012, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded
the Article IV consultation with Thailand.1
Background
Thailand is recovering from a very challenging year marked by natural disasters of historic
magnitude. First, the earthquake in Japan in March disrupted supply chains and slowed
down production, albeit temporarily. Then, the country was inundated by massive floods
that began in August and worsened in October–November, slowing the economy to a near
halt. In the last quarter of 2011 output contracted by 10¾ percent (quarter-on-quarter), the
largest quarterly contraction ever recorded, bringing annual growth down to 0.1 percent.
Manufacturing industries such as the automobile and electronics sectors were particularly
badly affected, but agriculture and tourism also suffered. Total losses are estimated at

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with

members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On
return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the
Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of
the Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the
country's authorities. An explanation of any qualifiers used in summing up can be found here:

about 3 percent of GDP. On a yearly basis, GDP growth shrank from 7.8 percent in 2010 to
a barely positive 0.1 percent in 2011.
However, the Thai economy is expected to rebound sharply in 2012, partly owing to
monetary easing and a large fiscal package. Positive signs of a recovery are already under
way with sharp improvements seen in high frequency indicators since December 2011.
Manufacturing output surged in December 2011 even though there are variations in the
pace of recovery across industries. Confidence indicators have almost reached their
pre-flood levels. As a result, GDP should grow by 5½ percent in 2012 and a further
7½ percent in 2013 due to a large carryover effect from the strong recovery in the second
half of 2012. Domestic demand is expected to be the driving force of growth in 2012, partly
due to reconstruction and flood-prevention efforts.
However, amidst uncertainty about the evolution of the global economy and the success of
flood-prevention measures, downside risks to the outlook are significant. The Thai
economy remains vulnerable to contagion from the turmoil in the euro area, and weak
growth in its trading partners as well as to domestic political tensions, if they were to be
renewed. If water management projects are not successful, that could also affect business
and consumer confidence.
The policy response is targeting income redistribution and flood prevention. The
government took office in August 2011 with policy priorities geared toward making income
distribution more equal and rebalancing growth toward domestic consumption.
Expansionary fiscal policies came at an opportune time to help offset weak world demand.
In addition, in response to the 2011 devastating floods the government added plans to
invest in flood-prevention and boost reconstruction-led recovery. Similarly, the Bank of
Thailand halted its gradual normalization policy and lowered the policy rate twice by a
cumulative 50 basis points in November 2011 and January 2012.
Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors commended the Thai authorities for their policy response to last year’s
floods, which propelled the strong recovery underway. They noted that the short-term
outlook is favorable, but significant downside risks stem from the unsettled global scenario,
internal political uncertainties, and capacity constraints in the execution of public works.

3

Directors concurred that the main challenge for the period ahead is to complete
reconstruction while maintaining macroeconomic stability and promoting inclusive growth.
Directors agreed that the current expansionary fiscal and monetary stances are appropriate
in the context of weak world demand and muted inflationary pressures. Against this
background, they supported the government’s fiscal package and welcomed the Bank of
Thailand’s recent decisions to lower interest rates. Directors noted, however, that the
authorities should unwind the supportive policy stance as the recovery takes hold and
move to a medium-term consolidation path consistent with low inflation and fiscal
sustainability. In particular, the authorities should stand ready to tighten monetary policy as
the output gap closes.
Directors agreed that the authorities’ commitment to fiscal prudence could be usefully
underpinned by a formalization of current budgetary practices and targets, and looked
forward to the adoption of the Public Finance Act. They also recommended improving
transparency and accountability of fiscal operations in line with the recommendations of
the 2009 review of fiscal standards and codes.
Directors supported the authorities’ ambitious reform agenda aimed at promoting more
inclusive growth. They observed that recent income redistribution policies, including the
rice price support mechanism, need to be monitored and assessed with a view to
containing fiscal costs and improve efficiency. In addition, minimum wage increases should
be accompanied by measures boosting labor productivity to preserve competitiveness. In
this context, Directors considered that technology transfers and investment in human
capital and infrastructure, particularly in less developed regions, are needed to raise
long-term growth. To create the fiscal space necessary to support these reforms, Directors
saw scope for scaling back subsidies, eliminating income tax credits, and reviewing the
rate structure for excise and value added taxes, while strengthening tax administration.
Directors noted that capital inflows have continued to be volatile and are likely to remain so
in the near term. With high international reserves, more risk-aware economic agents, and
increased availability of financial instruments to protect against volatility, Directors
considered that there is room to increase exchange rate flexibility in both directions. They
supported the authorities’ plans to further relax gradually restrictions on capital outflow
while ensuring that adequate safeguards are in place to protect against sudden reversals.

4

Directors welcomed the progress made in developing financial markets, which should
facilitate private investment. They called for swift action to mitigate risks from
government-owned specialized financial institutions by refocusing them on their core
mandate, improving risk assessment standards and strengthening supervision, as
suggested in the latest module of the Financial Sector Assessment Program. Directors also
recommended continuing to develop strong financial safety nets and to address remaining
weaknesses in the regulatory framework to combat money laundering and the financing of
terrorism.

Statement by Der Jiun Chia, Executive Director for Thailand
and Chaipat Poonpatpibul, Senior Advisor
April 27, 2012
1. On behalf of the Thai authorities, we would like to thank the IMF mission team for the 2012
Article IV Consultations following the unprecedented and devastating flood incident. The
discussions during the Consultation, which focused on challenges in securing the recovery
from the flood, enhancing macroeconomic stability amidst the elevated external risks and
promoting inclusive growth, were timely and constructive. The authorities broadly concur
with staff’s assessment on the economic outlook and major thrusts of policy
recommendations and would like to provide an update on the latest developments in Thailand
as well as clarifications on some policy issues as follows:
Updates on the recovery and near-term economic outlook
2. Thailand was hit by a perfect storm in 2011. First came the supply disruption from the
natural disaster in Japan in Q2, then the historic flood in Q4, and the global economic
slowdown which led to substantial output loss and a near-zero growth in 2011.
Notwithstanding these, the first quarter of 2012 Q1 saw a sharp rebound and the economy is
expected to grow by slightly above 8 percent qoq.
3. Latest economic indicators including the private consumption index, the private investment
index and farm income point to on-track recovery and activity is expected to normalize by
Q3 2012 in all key areas of the economy. With sustained recovery in manufacturing
production, particularly for automobile and electronics parts, exports have gradually resumed
their pre-flood trend. Meanwhile, swift recovery in private consumption has been due to
pent-up demand held back during the flood, favorable employment prospects, farm income
and well as conducive monetary conditions. With continued improvement in confidence, a
pickup in manufacturing production, and absence of significant delay in implementation of
the fiscal stimulus measures, private investment, led by reconstruction and replacement
spending is expected to sustain the growth momentum. Growth is projected to rebound to 5.7
percent in 2012 and resume a normal pace in 2013.
4. Notwithstanding these positive prospects, our authorities remain cautious. They are mindful
of the pace and effectiveness of implementation of the fiscal stimulus measures and
downside risks associated with weak demand from the advanced economies. The slowing
demand from China could also weigh down on the prospects of Thai exports.
5. Inflation remained stable and well-anchored in 2012 Q1. Headline inflation stood at 3.4
percent in 2012 Q1 compared to 4.0 percent in 2011 Q4, driven mainly by the deceleration of
fresh food price and core inflation amidst the acceleration of energy prices. Core inflation
trended down slightly from 2.8 percent in the previous quarter to 2.7 percent in 2012 Q1 due
to declining food and beverage prices. For the whole of 2012 and 2013, inflationary pressure
is expected to pick up from sustained improvement in global growth prospect, cost passthrough from rising oil prices and the minimum wage increase. Private demand is also

expected to pick up from the return of production to its potential level in the latter half of
2012. The Thai authorities will closely monitor any price development and will act to ensure
that inflation expectation is well anchored and inflation is within the target range.
Fiscal policy
6. On the fiscal policy front, our authorities welcome the detailed staff assessments and policy
recommendations which stress the importance of maintaining fiscal discipline. With fiscal
space, several revenue and expenditure measures as discussed in the Staff Report have been
employed to lift the economy from a deep contraction and also helped enhance growth
potential going forward. In this regard, positive progress has been made on several fronts.
The 2012 fiscal year budget has recently been approved in February allowing for necessary
spending plans to ensure on-track economic recovery. The water resource management
decree has also been passed in March. The decree does not stipulate time constraint for
spending but ensures prudence by mandating disbursement in accordance with specific
approved projects. Meanwhile, given the near-term acceleration in oil prices, the diesel tax
reduction scheme may be extended, subject to monthly assessment of the global oil price, so
as not to forestall the economic recovery.
7. The draft Public Finance Act is in progress and notwithstanding the projected lower
revenues, the fiscal sustainability framework is expected to remain intact. Nonetheless, the
government continues to strive for medium-term fiscal balance through such initiatives as the
establishment of infrastructure fund and the continuation of Public Private Partnership (PPP)
investment scheme. The authorities recognize that the credibility of the fiscal policy
framework could be strengthened further by making these rules legally binding. They also
share the Fund’s view that in addition to maintaining fiscal discipline and transparency,
timeliness and effectiveness of spending should be closely monitored.
Monetary policy
8. The authorities view that the current monetary policy stance is appropriate for supporting a
firm recovery as well as ensuring that inflation expectation is well-anchored. It is expected
that core inflation this year would still be within the official target band of 0.5 to 3 percent
notwithstanding potentially major upward risks such as the increase in minimum wage as
well as demand pressure from infrastructure spending. However, once the economic situation
returns to normalcy and the output gap closes, the policy rate would need to be gradually
adjusted to its normal path to anchor inflation expectation. Decision on the policy rate would
remain flexible and will be based on vigilant monitoring of the development of the
aforementioned risks to inflation.

Capital flows and exchange rate
9. Thailand has witnessed volatile capital flows with periods of capital influx and bouts of rapid
outflows during risk aversion periods in line with other regional emerging economies. To
ensure more balanced two-way flows the authorities are pressing ahead with the Capital
Account Liberalization Master Plan to gradually relax restrictions while maintaining
flexibility and safeguards against excessive speculation.
10. The Thai baht has been gradually strengthening since the beginning of 2012 on perceptions
of a strong recovery. Under the current managed float setting, the Thai baht is left to be
determined by economic fundamentals whilst intervention would be made only to dampen
excessive volatility. To date, the need for intervention has lessened as the private sector has
been more prepared and capable of coping with exchange rate risks. They also have better
understanding and greater experience in using hedging instruments. The Bank of Thailand
(BOT), in partnership with commercial banks, will continue to promote awareness of SMEs
on the importance of financial risk management.
11. Foreign reserves standing at 179.3 billion US dollars at the end of March 2012 are adequate
to cushion against external shocks. The authorities are mindful of the cost of the intervention
as well as the attendant reluctance of the private sector to adapt as they become more
accustomed to a stable environment. In this regard, they maintain that foreign reserves are
not a policy target and view that, with capital flows becoming more balanced in both
directions, the pace of foreign reserve accumulation would likely ebb going forward.
Financial Sector
12. The banking sector recorded strong capital and profitability despite significant challenges
from both the domestic front and the global financial crisis. The on-track implementation of
the plan under the Financial Sector Master Plan II will continue to strengthen the financial
system with an emphasis towards enhancing competition in response to changing financial
and regulatory environments.
13. Significant part of financial inclusion is pursued through Specialized Financial Institutions
(SFIs). These institutions are also used as instruments of the Government in implementing
social and economic policies. The authorities are mindful that extensive recourse to SFIs
could incur fiscal cost and will be closely monitoring their activities to ensure prudence and
transparency as well as prevent the build-up of risks to the financial system. They have also
instructed the SFIs to refocus on their core mandate and subjected them to the same levy as
commercial banks in order to foster a more level playing field.
14. As for the capital market, the investor base has grown significantly under the Capital Market
Development Master Plan partly due to increasing financial products in the market. Going
forward, the introduction of new products, the liberalization for cross-border sales of capital
market products in ASEAN and brokerage commission fee later this year will provide further

investment alternatives and greater tools for risk management as well as increase market
depth.
15. The authorities have made progress in improving the AML/CFT compliance. While the
necessary draft legislations are undergoing parliamentary approval process, AMLO itself is
enhancing its efficiency and organizational structure to implement the new legislation when
passed. Although the impact of the FATF’s downgrade so far has been limited, the
authorities will closely monitor the situation until completion of the legislative process.
Structural Policies
16. Our authorities are committed to strengthening medium- and long-term growth potentials and
concurrently ensure that growth benefits are widely and more evenly distributed. In addition
to the mega water management projects, large infrastructure projects funded by PPP such as
mass-transit system expansion as well as transportation linkages with neighboring countries
are proceeding on track. To foster progress on this front, the authorities are planning to
streamline a PPP process and set up a one-stop service agency for PPP projects.
17. The authorities appreciate the study on discrepancies of income across regions in Thailand
which underscored the need to alleviate income inequality during the next stages of
economic development. The recent policies including the minimum wage increases across
different regions and the rice price guarantee scheme have been adopted with income
redistribution as one of the main objectives.
Final Remarks
18. The Thai authorities are committed to ensure normalization of economic activity from the

severe flood period. They are mindful of key domestic and external risks and would therefore
closely monitor these developments. At the same time, the authorities emphasize that a key
priority for the medium- and long-term social and economic development is to pursue
inclusive growth.
19. Finally, our authorities would like to thank the IMF mission team for their efforts in

producing this comprehensive and thorough work on the recent economic and financial
developments in Thailand. In addition, they would like to convey their appreciation for the
topical analyses which are useful for near- and long-term policy making.
