•

The 2003 Article IV discussions took place in Washington, D.C., during May and June. The staff team
comprised C. Collyns (Head), C. Towe, M. Mühleisen, R. Cardarelli, C. Faulkner-MacDonagh,
I. Ivaschenko, and A. Kose (all WHD); A. Hilaire (PDR); C. Schnure (ICM); and D. Simard (FAD).
Ms. Jacklin and Ms. Lundsager, U.S. Executive Director and Alternate U.S. Executive Director,
respectively, and Mr. Baukol (Advisor), also attended the meetings.

•

The Managing Director, the First Deputy Managing Director, Mr. Rogoff (RES), and Mr. Singh
(WHD) took part in the concluding discussions with Treasury Secretary Snow and Federal Reserve
Chairman Greenspan. The mission met with officials from the U.S. Treasury, the Federal Reserve, the
Department of Energy, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, the Council of Economic
Advisers, the Office of Management and Budget, the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative, the
Congressional Budget Office, the National Governors Association, the Office of Federal Housing
Enterprise Oversight, and the Securities and Exchange Commission. The team also met with financial
market participants and the Federal Reserve Bank of New York during March.

•

The 2002 consultation was concluded in July 2002 (Appendix I). At the time, Executive Directors
noted the remarkable resilience of the U.S. economy but stressed the downside risks to the outlook and
the importance of policies to support an orderly correction of the large U.S. current account deficit.
Accordingly, they encouraged the adoption of a fiscal framework that included the clear goal of
balancing the budget excluding Social Security, as well as early steps to place the Social Security and
Medicare systems on a sound financial footing. They supported the Federal Reserve’s accommodative
policy stance, but noted the room for further easing if conditions warranted. Finally, Executive Directors
expressed concern regarding agricultural subsidies and safeguard duties on steel imports and urged
U.S. leadership in promoting trade liberalization.

•

The United States has accepted the obligations of Article VIII, and it maintains an exchange system free
of restrictions on payments and transfers for current international transactions (Appendix I).
Comprehensive economic data are available for the United States on a timely basis, the United States
subscribes to the Fund’s Special Data Dissemination Standard, and its metadata are posted on the
Fund’s Data Standards Bulletin Board (Appendix II).

I. INTRODUCTION AND OVERVIEW
1.
The 2003 consultation took place against the backdrop of heightened uncertainty
about the strength of the recovery. After experiencing one of the largest stock market
declines in the post-war period and then falling into recession in early 2001, the economy was
buffeted by a series of further shocks, including the September 11th attacks, major corporate
failures, additional stock price declines, and the war in Iraq. Remarkably, productivity growth
has remained robust; the rise in the unemployment rate has been relatively modest; and large
corporate bankruptcies were absorbed without a systemic impact on financial intermediaries.
Nevertheless, the recovery has been uneven and sluggish.
2.
The weak economy and security concerns have overshadowed policy making and
significantly undermined the fiscal position. Despite an aggressive easing of monetary
policy, economic slack has increased and deflation has now become a concern. On the fiscal
front, the policy focus has been on tax cuts, fiscal stimulus, and—since the September 11th
attacks—boosting security-related spending. As a result, the fiscal surpluses that were
achieved over the course of the 1990s have given way to large deficits, complicating the task
of dealing with impending demographic pressures.
3.

Against this background, discussions centered on:

•

Managing short-term risks. With the substantial deterioration in the fiscal outlook,
and inflation low, monetary policy should bear the principal responsibility to respond if
the recovery does not regain momentum.

•

Re-establishing a sustainable fiscal framework. The additional stimulus introduced
this year leaves the fiscal position even less well prepared to cope with impending
demographic pressures. The priority remains to establish a credible framework for
delivering a balanced budget, excluding Social Security, over the medium-term and to
place retirement and health care systems on a sound financial footing.

•

International perspectives. The U.S. economy has helped support global growth in
recent years, but the eventual correction of imbalances related to large fiscal and
current account deficits could impose costs on the rest of the world. On trade issues,
strong U.S. leadership is needed toward forging deep and broad-based liberalization in
the Doha Round.

4.
U.S. officials remarked that U.S. policies had been broadly consistent with Fund
advice over the years, which mainly reflected a shared philosophy about the importance of
sound and market-oriented policies. Differences of view remained, however. While the
authorities had broadly agreed last year with the staff on the need for medium-term fiscal
consolidation, the weak economy and national security had been seen as more immediate
priorities. The authorities did not share the staff’s long-standing concern regarding the U.S.
current account deficit, which they considered mainly a reflection of weak growth abroad and,
therefore, not a U.S. policy matter. Although staff has expressed some specific concerns in
recent years regarding U.S. trade actions, officials emphasized the overall U.S. commitment
to multilateral trade liberalization.

II. RECENT ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS
5.
Following a relatively shallow downturn in 2001, the economy has staged an
uneven recovery (Tables 1, 2, and 3). Despite a massive collapse of equity prices and
business investment, the 2001 recession was mild and short-lived, with output dropping by
only ½ percent in the first three quarters. Thereafter, a series of shocks began to weigh on
activity, including: the

6.
As a result of slow
growth, employment has stagnated,
economic slack has continued to rise,
and inflation has fallen to near postwar lows. Private nonfarm payrolls
remained 2¾ percent below their early
2001 peak in June 2003. The
unemployment rate rose sharply from a
30-year low of just under 4 percent in
early 2000, but remained in the 5½–
6 percent range during most of 2002 and
early 2003. However, the unemployment
rate jumped to 6¼ percent in June.
(Figure 2). Although strong productivity
growth in recent years has left measures
of potential output subject to
considerable uncertainty, most estimates
suggest the output gap widened to
around 2½ percent in early 2003
(Figure 3). With slack increasing, the
core CPI inflation rate has trended
downward to under 1½ percent, a level
not seen since the mid–1960s.

7.
The economy’s recent loss of momentum occurred despite exceptional support
from monetary and fiscal policies. Although the dollar’s strength and the drop in stock
prices have weighed on indicators of financial conditions, monetary easing has been
unprecedented. The federal funds rate target was reduced by a cumulative 475 basis points
during 2001, a further 50 basis points in November 2002, and an additional 25 basis points in
June 2003. As a result, long-term bond yields have fallen close to post-war lows (Figure 4).
On the fiscal front, substantial reductions in income tax rates were legislated in June 2001;
March 2002 legislation increased investment incentives and extended unemployment benefits;
defense and security-related spending

8.
Private consumption has remained remarkably resilient, owing to income gains,
low interest rates, and the housing market boom. During the two years ending May 2003,
real disposable income rose by 7¼ percent, over half of which reflected tax cuts and higher
unemployment benefits. In addition, productivity gains facilitated strong growth of labor
incomes, as hourly wage increases more than offset employment declines. Lower mortgage
rates and higher home prices prompted record refinancing, which reduced interest payments
and freed up home equity for consumption and debt repayment.1 Discounting by auto and
other manufacturers also mitigated the effects of higher energy prices. As a result, households
managed to maintain consumption, spur strong growth in residential investment, and still
boost their saving rate from 2 percent in mid-1999 to around 3½ percent in early 2003.
9.
By contrast, the recovery in business fixed investment has been tentative. Purchases
of equipment and software plummeted from historical highs relative to GDP during 2000-01,
but began to recover in the last three quarters of 2002, supported by a rebound in profits and
the replacement of IT equipment purchased ahead of Y2K. Through much of 2002, inventory
restocking also provided a substantial boost to activity. However, confidence in the underlying
strength of investment demand was dampened by a renewed drop in business equipment and
software purchases in the first quarter of 2003, and a sharp increase in industrial vacancy rates
continued to weigh on nonresidential structures investment.
1

The Federal Reserve estimates that mortgage refinancing allowed homeowners to “cash out” approximately
$200 billion (2 percent of GDP), around one half of which was used to pay down other forms of debt.

-7-

10.
Weak investment has reflected the uncertain strength of corporate profits and
balance sheets. Profits began to recover in early 2002, spurred by a 4¾ percent surge in
productivity—the fastest annual rate in over 50 years—and a concomitant 2 percent decline
in unit labor costs (Figure 5). Cash flows

Some sectors suffer
particularly severely from high debt
loads, long-standing structural
problems, and declining output
prices. Cash flows in the auto,
industrial machinery, and steel-using
(fabricated metals) industries remain
particularly weak, and significant losses
have been registered in the
transportation and communications
sectors. In many of these industries,
employee defined-benefit pension plans
are also severely underfunded, and
increased employer contributions have
further dampened profit growth.

recover modestly in 2002 from their

again toward the end of the year and in early 2003. Capital goods exports were particularly
weak owing to sluggish investment abroad. By contrast, import volumes rebounded strongly
in 2002, reflecting purchases of consumer goods and industrial supplies, before dipping in
2003Q1. With higher world oil prices, the current account deficit reached a record 5¼ percent
of GDP in 2003Q1 (Figure 7 and Table 4).

-8-

13.
Investor concerns regarding
the U.S. trade imbalance and interest
rate differentials have weighed on the
dollar since early 2002 (Figure 8).
After appreciating by 30 percent in real
effective terms during 1999–2001, the
dollar has weakened sharply against the
euro and Japanese yen from February
2002 (Figure 8). In real effective terms,
the decline was more moderate—around
10 percent to early June 2003—since
the dollar remained strong vis-à-vis
Latin American and Asian currencies.
As a result, staff estimates suggest that
the dollar is still some 20 percent above
levels consistent with medium-term
fundamentals.2
14.
The dollar’s decline has been
associated with a drop in private
capital inflows for purchases of
corporate securities and direct
investment. However, increased
purchases of dollar reserves by foreign
central banks and lower U.S.
investments abroad helped finance the
large current account deficit (Figure 9).
The U.S. net foreign liability position
reached 23 percent of GDP by
end-2002, from under 5 percent of GDP
in the early 1990s.

The increased risk aversion that

CGER assessments in early 2003 suggested that a real effective depreciation of the U.S. dollar of well over
20 percent would be required to reduce the U.S. current account deficit to 2 percent of GDP, a level consistent with
the equilibrium saving-investment balance. Purchasing power parity-based estimates yielded similar levels of misalignment. However, the dollar’s depreciation in recent months, and the significant decrease in public saving that is
now projected, have narrowed the degree of overvaluation.

Enron and WorldCom and a scaling back of profit forecasts, and corporate bond spreads
widened. Market sentiment remained weak in the run-up to the Iraq war, but has since
improved considerably. The S&P 500 index rose by nearly 15 percent during April–May, and
spreads have narrowed significantly since the beginning of 2003. With U.S. stock prices
roughly 35 percent below their early 2000 peak, valuations now appear broadly in line with
historical norms.
III. POLICY DISCUSSIONS
A. Economic Conditions and Prospects
16.
The staff projects activity to gather momentum in the latter half of 2003, with GDP
growth rising from around 2¼ percent in 2003 to 3½ percent in 2004. Consumer sentiment
has improved with the quick end to the Iraq war, and household demand would also be
supported by additional tax cuts, the rebound in stock prices, low interest rates, and the easing
of oil prices. These same factors, as well as strong productivity growth, are also expected to
allow profits and business fixed investment to gather momentum into 2004. The drag from net
exports would wane into 2004, reflecting a gradual strengthening in partner countries and the
lagged effects of the dollar’s depreciation, and the current account deficit would start to
narrow somewhat from around 5 percent of GDP in 2003. With economic slack remaining
significant, CPI inflation is projected to fall to around 1¼ percent in 2004, before rebounding
somewhat as the output gap
closes.

provided ample evidence that
the efficiency gains of the 1990s were not illusory. In their view, consensus estimates of U.S.
long-term productivity potential of 2–2½ percent could be conservative.
18.
Discussions focused on the tenuous nature of the short-term recovery. Treasury
officials agreed that 2003 growth was likely to be less than the 3 percent rate assumed in the
FY 2004 Budget and closer to the staff’s projection. The weaker outlook reflected the
economy’s difficulty in working off the combined effect of the collapse of equity prices and
the shock to confidence from the corporate scandals of 2001–2002. Although low interest

- 10 -

rates, the drop in oil prices, higher defense spending, and recent tax cuts were expected to
provide a substantial lift to activity, more subdued scenarios could not be ruled out.3
19.
Treasury and Federal Reserve officials agreed that business fixed investment
represented the principal risk to the outlook. Most studies suggested that only a modest
capital overhang had emerged at the beginning of the downturn, but other factors appeared to
have weighed on investment including: high levels of excess capacity, geopolitical
uncertainties and its impact on risk-taking, rising health care and energy costs, and the need to
fund defined benefit plans (Box 1). Although credit conditions and corporate balance sheet
restructuring favored a strong rebound of investment, a sustained improvement in business
confidence and profits was also needed.
20.
Officials viewed the risks to household demand as more modest. The strength of
consumption through the downturn was broadly consistent with low interest rates, strong
wage growth, the surge in housing prices, and tax cuts. Household balance sheets did not
exhibit signs of stress—delinquency rates were modest and debt service burdens were not
excessive. The personal saving rate had already responded to the decline in household net
wealth, and further adjustments were likely to be gradual (Box 2).
21.
While recognizing that housing prices were showing signs of overheating, officials
discounted the possibility of a collapse. Some urban areas had seen rapid growth in market
values, and prices were at the upper end—or even somewhat above—of ranges consistent
with underlying fundamentals (Figure 11).4 However, the housing market was considered to
be relatively insulated from speculative excess; loan-to-value ratios remained comfortable;
households were locking in mortgages at low, long-term rates; and market turnover appeared
orderly. While the rate of price increase

See the forthcoming Selected Issues paper for an analysis of the impact of energy price shocks.

Although some recent research—surveyed in the forthcoming Selected Issues paper—suggests that housing
prices could be as much as 10–15 percent higher than justified by market fundamentals, most analysts suggest
that prices are more likely to slow rather than decline outright.

- 11 Box 1. Capacity Utilization and Investment
The U.S. capacity utilization rate declined sharply during 2001 and has yet to show convincing signs of a
turn-around. Moreover, while some other measures of economic slack—such as the unemployment rate—have
fared better than in previous cyclical downturns, capacity utilization in the current recession remains
considerably lower than in many past recessions, with the exception of the early 1980s.
The dispersion of capacity utilization rates across
industries has also been high. Presently, the rate
ranges from the low 60s in the high-tech industries
to the high 80s in the petroleum and coal industries.
Measured in terms of a weighted standard deviation,
the dispersion across industries has reached levels
not seen since the early 1980s.
These developments have raised the question
whether the low level of capacity utilization will
weigh on investment going forward. In particular, a
number of analysts have argued that firms are
unlikely to invest in plant and equipment until
capacity constraints become more pressing.
Simple statistical analysis does suggest that
capacity utilization influences future investment.
The correlation between investment and the capacity
utilization rate (with lags of up to four quarters) is in
the range of 0.4, and simple bivariate tests also
suggest that capacity utilization does “Grangercause” growth in investment but not the reverse.

the absence of a significant capital overhang. The

1990s, and at just over 120 percent at the end of

Staff estimates indicate that while a modest

relatively quickly, given the recent drop in

type of equipment. Moreover, the average age of
equipment in the manufacturing sector, remains
relatively high—at 8.3 years for equipment and software. Finally, the industrial sector only accounts for about
17 percent of GDP, so that industrial capacity utilization rates do not necessarily reflect developments in the
broader U.S. economy.

Box 2. Is the U.S. Saving Rate Too Low?
U.S. household wealth has fallen significantly since 2000, raising concerns that household demand may be
withdrawn in order to restore savings. Household net worth has fallen sharply between 2000 and 2003—by
approximately $4 trillion, or 9 percent. Casual inspection of the relationship between the saving rate and
household net worth suggests that a decline in wealth of this magnitude would lead to an increase in personal
saving of around 4 percentage points. The actual rise in the saving rate has been much more modest,
however—less than 2 percentage points, from 2 percent in 2000Q1 to around 3½ percent in 2003Q1.
The slow pickup in saving so far can be
partly explained by a different response of
saving to the accumulation of different types
of wealth. A long-run model of consumption,
income, and wealth was estimated—where
wealth was measured in three categories:
housing, equity, and non-equity financial
wealth (demand deposits, bonds, and other
forms of liquid wealth).1 The results suggest
that saving is about 3-4 times more responsive
to changes in non-equity financial wealth than
to changes in either residential or equity
wealth. This higher responsiveness may be due
to the more liquid nature of non-equity wealth,
which means that it can be drawn down
quickly, if needed.

money market mutual funds accounted for
much of the growth in non-equity financial
wealth, as the stock market decline led households to redirect savings into less risky assets and to attempt to
lock in capital gains. As a result, the long-run equilibrium saving rate was estimated to be about 4½ percent
in 2003Q1, only modestly above the actual saving rate of 3½ percent.
However, more abrupt adjustments to the saving rate cannot be ruled out. For example, if the economy
were to falter, asset classes that have, to date, dampened losses in the equity market—especially residential
housing—could come under pressure. Moreover, the model partly explains the decline in the U.S. saving
rate over the past decade in terms of a trend decline, likely reflecting financial innovation, and it remains to
be seen whether this trend will be sustained.2

22.
Officials acknowledged that state and local governments were under significant
fiscal stress, which was likely to act as a further drag on activity.5 Most states were facing a
third consecutive year of budget difficulties—mainly the result of a sharp drop in tax receipts.
State governments were expecting financing gaps of around ¾ percent of GDP in FY 2004,
with state employee pension plans also being significantly underfunded. States had largely
exhausted the scope for using extra-budgetary funds to meet their balanced budget
requirements and had already taken steps to boost fees, freeze salaries and hiring, reduce
services, and curb payments to health care providers. Even with the federal aid recently
legislated by Congress, more painful cuts in services and tax increases would be required.
23.
Officials viewed the weak global environment as a key risk to the domestic outlook.
They noted that partner country growth projections had been marked down much more
significantly than for the United States and that net exports would likely act as a drag on U.S.
demand. Moreover, the dollar’s depreciation had been relatively modest in real effective
terms, and the U.S. current account deficit would likely remain high in the near term.
24.
Federal Reserve officials highlighted that deflation was a small but important risk.6
Core inflation indices measured on an annualized 3-month basis had fallen to around
1 percent in recent months, already close to zero, after subtracting measurement biases of around
½ percentage point (Figure 12). The recent decline—which partly reflected shocks to the
relative price of durables and imports—was larger than could be explained by the Fed’s
statistical models—and with an output gap presently in the range of 2 percent or higher—
inflation could fall further. However, outright deflation seemed unlikely in view of the
monetary and fiscal stimulus in the pipeline, the fact that inflation expectations seemed well
anchored, and the support to prices that would come from the dollar’s weakness and recent
increases in commodity prices and employment costs.
B. Monetary and Exchange Rate Policies
25.
Recent policy statements by monetary policymakers have signaled increased
concern regarding the outlook. The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) took the
unusual step in its May 2003 statement of suggesting that while the risks to growth were
balanced in the near term, “the probability of an unwelcome substantial fall in inflation, though
minor, exceeds that of a pickup.” The statement was perceived by markets as reflecting a
heightened concern regarding deflation and suggesting that further easing was in store. As a
result, longer-dated yields fell and markets started pricing in at least a further quarter point cut
in the federal funds rate target. Indeed, at its late June meeting, the FOMC re-affirmed its
concern regarding a possible further decline in inflation and lowered its target for the federal
funds rate 25 basis points.

See the forthcoming Selected Issues paper for a more detailed discussion.

The IMF’s April 2003 Task Force report—Deflation: Determinants, Risks, and Policy Options—concluded
that the risk of U.S. deflation was low, especially in view of the responsiveness of U.S. policymaking.

26.
The Federal Reserve officials explained that the FOMC’s recent statements
reflected a view that a deflationary spiral was a low-probability, but high-cost, event.
Although relatively benign periods of price declines could occur in the face of favorable
productivity or other supply shocks, policy makers were very mindful of the corrosive effects
that sustained deflation could have on balance sheets and the effectiveness of conventional
monetary policy instruments. With inflation already at a very low level and the output gap
likely to remain wide for some time, the economy would be exposed to significant
cumulative risk of a large demand shock pushing inflation into negative territory.
27.
In discussing the possible merits of further easing, the mission asked whether the
sluggish recovery suggested that the interest rate channel for monetary policy had
weakened. Officials agreed that activity had been disappointing, especially given the
significant monetary and fiscal stimulus that had been injected, but they did not view this as
evidence that conventional monetary policy instruments had lost traction. Indeed, the strength
of housing investment and durable goods purchases confirmed that the usual transmission
mechanism remained effective. However, overall financial conditions had not been as
supportive of business investment and external demand, especially given the dollar’s earlier
strength, heightened risk aversion, and the level of stock prices (Figure 13).
28.
Federal Reserve officials
expressed confidence that policy
instruments would still be available even
if short-term interest rates approached
zero. If necessary, the Fed would inject
liquidity, to expand the size of its balance
sheet, and would also operate at different
points on the yield curve. The
expectations channel also represented a
potent instrument, as illustrated by the
drop in long-term bond yields following
the May FOMC meeting.

29.
Nonetheless, Federal Reserve officials stressed that there were good reasons to
avoid having to test these unconventional instruments. Most importantly, there was no U.S.
experience regarding the quantitative impact of monetary policy close to the zero interest rate
bound. Moreover, even moving close to the zero bound could have potentially important
adverse microeconomic effects. In a low interest rate environment, money market spreads
would become compressed and make it difficult for intermediaries to cover their costs.
30.
Staff and Federal Reserve officials agreed that these factors argued for pre-emptive
action to avoid deflation. The Japanese experience, in particular, illustrated the importance
of demonstrating at an early stage a commitment to avoiding deflation. To this end, U.S.
policymakers had actively sought to re-assure markets that the FOMC recognized the
potential risks and was prepared to act.

- 16 -

31.
The authorities saw little advantage to stating a quantified medium-term inflation
objective, since the FOMC’s inflation objectives were well understood. The FOMC’s May
statement had set a lower bound to its definition of reasonable price stability by signaling a
preference to avoid seeing inflation fall further from its present level of around 1 percent.
Moreover, surveys and spreads on inflation-indexed bonds showed that expectations were
already well anchored. A more specific statement of the Fed’s objectives would risk eroding
credibility, since the Fed did not have the instruments to hit a particular numerical inflation
target exactly and—at times—might wish to give priority to stabilizing economic activity.
They acknowledged, however, that opinions varied among the FOMC’s members on this
issue, and if deflation pressures intensified, interest in this approach might increase.
Moreover, the recent experience may have persuaded FOMC members to consider a
somewhat higher rate of inflation as consistent with the definition of price stability.
32.
The team noted the recent weakening of the U.S. dollar and expressed concern that
the large U.S. current account deficit created risks of disorderly adjustments. Especially
given the weakening of public saving, the U.S. current account deficit seemed likely to remain
at a high level and take the U.S. net foreign liability position to over 40 percent of GDP
by 2008. Against this background, the dollar still seemed over-valued relative to medium-term
fundamentals, and a correction—especially if it were triggered by weaker confidence in
U.S. productivity rather than stronger growth abroad—could adversely affect both the United
States and partner countries. Key channels would be: a significant increase in borrowing costs
for U.S. firms; an erosion of competitiveness for foreign producers; and substantial capital
losses on foreign holdings of U.S. assets.7
33.
U.S. Treasury officials stressed that recent exchange rate movements had been
orderly and that there had been no change in the authorities’ policy approaches. The fact
that the dollar’s depreciation had been accompanied by rallies in bond and stock markets
demonstrated continued confidence in the U.S. economy. Moreover, the dollar’s buoyancy
since the mid-1990s mainly reflected a market response to the strength of U.S.
macroeconomic performance. Thus, in their view, as long as the exchange rate did not reflect
policy missteps, the current account deficit was not a cause for concern. The authorities also
dismissed the possible need for foreign exchange market intervention, since even coordinated
intervention tended to have little sustained effect.
34.
Federal Reserve officials also saw little risk of disorderly adjustment, while
acknowledging that the present current account deficit would be difficult to sustain.
Deficits of this magnitude would imply rapid increases in U.S. net foreign liabilities, requiring
7

See Appendix III, as well as the 2002 Staff Report and Selected Issues paper, for debt sustainability analyses.
U.S. assets abroad reached around 60 percent of GDP in 2001 and were mostly denominated in foreign currency,
while foreign assets in the United States totaled around 80 percent of GDP and were largely denominated in U.S.
dollars, implying that a depreciation of the dollar would impose significant capital losses on foreigners and help to
erase the net U.S. liability.

- 17 -

a willingness by foreigners to continue to increase their share of U.S. assets. As investment
income outflows increased, an ever-larger correction in the trade balance and exchange rates
would eventually be necessary to service external debt and stabilize the net liability position.
C. Fiscal Policy
35.
Fiscal policy discussions took place against the backdrop of the Congressional
debate over the Administration’s February 2003 Budget and tax cut proposals. Following
two years of unprecedented fiscal stimulus, the Administration’s FY 2004 Budget called for
further increases in the fiscal deficits reflecting:
•

Tax cuts—Proposals included the elimination of the double taxation of dividends, the
acceleration of earlier-scheduled reductions in marginal tax rates, and an expansion of
tax preferences for savings.

•

Spending increases—Proposed
increases in outlays for Medicaid,
income security, and a
prescription drug benefit under
the Medicare program would be
only partly offset by assumed
cost savings from improvements
in the administration of Social
Security (Figure 14).
Discretionary spending—
spending requiring annual
Congressional appropriations—
would grow 1¼ percent faster
than in the current services baseline
over FY 2004–FY 2008, driven by
increases for defense and homeland
security, while other discretionary
spending would decline in real
terms.

supplemental spending bill was approved,
aimed mostly at covering the cost of the

extended unemployment insurance benefits and aid for the states. Although the ten-year cost
of the package was placed at only$350 billion, this reflected the inclusion of “sunset”

Box 3. Recent U.S. Tax Initiatives
Significant tax cuts were legislated in April 2001. The measures included: an immediate 1 percentage point
reduction in personal income tax rates for most brackets, and further 1 percentage point cuts in 2004 and 2006; a
gradual elimination of the estate tax by 2010; phased increases in the child tax credit; and tax relief for married
couples phased in over 2005–2009. The ten-year cost of the measures was held to $1.35 trillion by phasing them
in gradually and allowing them to expire after 2010.
Further tax cuts were proposed in February 2003 as a part of the Administration’s FY 2004 Budget. The
measures were estimated to cost a cumulative $1.3 trillion over FY 2004–2013, and included:
•

An economic growth package that would bring forward to 2003 the previously-scheduled reductions in
marginal tax rates, increases in the child tax credit, and marriage penalty relief; eliminate the double taxation
of dividends; and provide temporary tax incentives for businesses investment. Cost: $726 billion over
FY 2004–FY 2013.

•

Other tax incentives, including measures to encourage saving, charitable giving, and health care;
unemployment insurance reform; and tax simplification. Cost: $114 billion.

•

Permanent extension of expiring tax provisions, including the 2001 cuts. Cost: $588 billion.

The Jobs and Growth Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of May 2003 contained most of the Administration’s
growth package. However, dividends were not fully excluded from personal income tax, and the measures were
made subject to sunsets in order to contain the total cost to $350 billion through FY 2013. The package included:
•

•

•

•

Dividends and capital gains—The tax rate on
capital gains was lowered to 15 percent and was
applied to dividends. A 10 percent rate for lowincome households was to be reduced in phases
to zero percent for low-income brackets by
2008. These measures would expire after 2008.
Personal income tax rates—The tax rate
reductions scheduled for 2004 and 2006 were
brought forward to 2003, lowering brackets
from 27, 30, 35, and 38.6 percent to 25, 28, 33,
and 35 percent, respectively. However, the rates
would revert to pre-2001 levels after 2010. The
expansion of the 10 percent income bracket
scheduled for 2008 was also brought forward to
2003 but would expire after 2007.
Marriage penalty—The standard tax deduction
for married taxpayers filing joint returns was
increased to 200 percent of that for single
taxpayers beginning in 2003 but would expire
after 2004.
Child tax credit—The child tax credit was
increased from $600 to $1,000 in 2003 and
2004, reverting to $500 in 2011.

37.
The mission expressed concern
that these measures significantly
worsened the fiscal outlook (Table 5).8
Staff projects the budget deficit to reach
around 4 percent of GDP in both
FY 2003 and FY 2004, roughly
2½ percentage points above the
FY 2004 current-services baseline
published in February. The deficit is
projected to decline gradually to around
1¾ percent of GDP in FY 2008, around
2¼ percent of GDP higher than under
the baseline, and the debt ratio would be
roughly 15 percentage points higher as a
result by FY 2012 (Figures 15 and 16).
The risks to these projections also
appear substantial, since they are
predicated on a rebound in revenue
buoyancies, which have been depressed
as a result of the stock market collapse,
and since the policies necessary to hold
nondefense outlays roughly constant in
real terms have not been defined
(Figure 17).9 Less optimistic
assumptions could add a further
1½ percent of GDP to the deficit
forecast for FY 2008. (Appendix III
illustrates the range of uncertainty that
attaches to the fiscal projections.)

Staff budget projections are based on the Budget projections adjusted to take into account: (i) recent supplemental
spending appropriations and the May 2003 tax package; (ii) differences between macroeconomic assumptions;
(iii) the likelihood that additional Alternative Minimum Tax (AMT) relief would be provided, costing ½ percent of
GDP annually; and (iv) higher growth of discretionary and Medicare spending, in line with Congressional Budget
Office (CBO) projections. The 2001 and 2003 tax cuts are assumed to be made permanent, in line with
Administration policy statements.

Proposals to further expand the child tax credit to lower income households could add an additional $10-80 billion

The staff’s concerns are heightened by the projected impact of demographic trends
on the longer-term fiscal position. Although the expected increase in the old-age dependency
ratio is less severe than for many other industrial countries, outlays for Social Security and
Medicare are projected to surge, owing to the retirement of the baby-boom generation
beginning later this decade and the

U.S. officials considered that the fiscal position remained manageable and stressed
that the Administration’s initiatives would yield both short-term and long-term benefits. In
the short term, the tax cuts and spending increases would provide important insurance for the
recovery, especially given the weakening of activity since late 2002 and the limited room for
further interest rate cuts. Since much of the package involved bringing forward tax cuts that
were already scheduled for 2004 and 2006, the long-run impact on the fiscal position was
relatively modest, and the deficit and federal debt as a share of GDP would remain relatively
low into the medium term. Moreover, the tax cuts would lower the cost of capital, move the
tax system closer to a consumption basis, and yield important supply-side benefits, which
would also help offset the fiscal costs.
40.
The U.S. officials expressed confidence in the budget projections. They
acknowledged that revenue receipts still remained depressed, but the Administration’s
revenue forecast was in line with that of the CBO, which also assumed a rebound in the
revenue ratio once capital gains realizations normalized. Although the Budget had not
specified explicit policies to achieve the projected compression of discretionary spending,
there was little purpose to such an exercise beyond the next fiscal year, given that these
expenditures were subject to annual appropriations by Congress.

10

The Social Security system is funded by a 12.4 percent payroll tax and has accrued financial assets—
government securities—totaling around 14 percent of GDP. The Medicare system—which includes Hospital
Insurance (HI) and Supplemental Medical Insurance (SMI)—is only partly funded by a dedicated payroll tax of
2.9 percent and premium payments by the elderly, and it has accrued assets of only around 2 percent of GDP. See
the 2002 Selected Issues paper for details and long-term projections.

- 21 -

41.
The staff representatives questioned whether the tax cuts would have significant
demand- and supply-side benefits. Since the benefits seemed to accrue largely to higherincome households, and the sunsets meant that the cuts would be viewed at least partially as
temporary, the effect on demand could be muted. The longer-term, efficiency gains might also
be modest since Congress had backed away from the measures with the greatest structural
benefits—including the elimination of the double taxation of dividends and the reform of tax
deferred savings plans—while leaving the permanence of the remaining measures uncertain. In
addition, the higher deficits now projected would eventually tend to crowd out investment,
thus offsetting any efficiency gains that might result (Box 4). The Treasury officials responded
that, in their view, budget deficits typically had only a small effect on interest rates, and
crowding out seemed unlikely given how low bond yields were presently and given the modest
deficits that were projected in the period ahead.
42.
The mission expressed concern regarding the apparent weakening of fiscal
discipline and fiscal transparency in recent years. The staff’s Fiscal ROSC recognized that
the U.S. fiscal system set a high standard in many respects, but noted the absence of an
effective medium- and long-term fiscal framework (Box 5). Budget Enforcement Act (BEA)
rules had been circumvented in recent years and had been allowed to expire altogether in 2002;
phasing and sunsets had been used to understate the longer-run cost of the 2001 and 2003 tax
cuts; and the Administration had opted to forgo ten-year budget projections.
43.
The U.S. officials agreed with the need for greater spending discipline. In their view,
the principal cause for the widening of the fiscal deficit in recent years was the rapid growth of
discretionary spending, which implied that tighter control of expenditures was essential to
narrow the deficit. The Administration supported the re-authorization and strengthening of the
BEA’s discretionary spending caps

commitment to balancing the budget, excluding Social Security, and for measures to place
the Social Security and Medicare systems on a sound financial footing (Figure 19).

Box 4. The Macroeconomic and Multilateral Effects of Budget Deficits
The U.S. federal budget outlook has deteriorated considerably in recent years. In 2000, Congressional Budget
Office (CBO) projections were for surpluses to remain in the range of 3 percent of GDP for the next 10 years
and for the federal debt to be nearly eliminated by 2010. However, with the introduction of tax cuts in 2001,
considerably weaker-than-expected revenue performance, and the tax cuts enacted in May this year, substantial
federal deficits are likely to persist for the next decade. CBO estimates that the federal deficit would average
around 1¾ percent of GDP and that publicly held debt would remain in the range of 35 percent of GDP over
2004-2013, before beginning to rise sharply in the face of adverse demographic trends.
The sharp turnaround in the budget outlook has revived
the long-standing debate about the impact of fiscal deficits
on interest rates and economic growth. Some economists
have argued that any impact of budget deficits on interest
rates would be small and outweighed by the favorable
supply-side effects of Administration policies. Others,
however, have stressed the risk that large deficits would
boost interest rates, lower investment, and reduce the
economy’s long-run potential.

budget deficits raise interest rates. Although a number of
Projected cumulative federal deficit/GDP
past studies suggest that deficits would have only a
ratios over five years
negligible impact on interest rates, Gale and Orszag (2002)
argue that most of these studies have not adequately taken
into account that financial markets are forward-looking and that interest rates respond to expectations of future
government deficits and debt. They illustrate that there is a positive correlation between the five-year
cumulative deficits projected by the CBO and spreads on longer and short-term bonds. Moreover, Gale and
Orszag survey a range of standard macroeconomic forecasting models and show that such models typically
would predict a 50 basis point increase in bond yields for a 1 percentage point of GDP (tax-cut induced)
increase in the federal deficit.

Simulations of the 2003 Administration’s original tax cut proposal using macroeconomic models also
illustrate its long-term costs. Macroeconomic Advisors and Global Insight report simulations showing that the
Administration’s plan would provide a sizeable short-term boost to activity, raising GDP by up to 1½ percent
above baseline by 2004, but output would fall back to its baseline by around 2007–2008. Thereafter, fiscal
deficits and higher long-term interest rates would cause a decrease in output. Similarly, a recent CBO (2003)
report shows that, unless the tax cuts are reversed at some point in the future, they would reduce output over the
long run (by around ½–1½ percent), owing to slower capital accumulation.
The international implications of higher U.S. fiscal deficits may also be important. Given the increased
integration of financial markets, the U.S. fiscal policy could have a significant influence on the U.S. current
account deficits and on real interest rates in other countries. Simulations of the Oxford Economic Forecasting
model show that a 1 percent of GDP increase in the U.S. fiscal deficit results in a ½ percent of GDP increase in
the current account deficit. Moreover, the large share of U.S. public debt in global markets suggests that higher
levels of U.S. public debt might spill over to the rest of the world and cause higher global interest rates. Staff
estimates show that the Administration’s tax cuts could lead to a ½–1 percentage point increase in world real
interest rates over the next decade.

Box 5. Fiscal Transparency in the United States
During November 2002–February 2003, a staff team conducted a review of fiscal transparency in
the United States in relation to the IMF’s Code of Good Practices on Fiscal Transparency.1 The
principal conclusions of that review are as follows:
•

The United States is fully compliant with most elements of the Fund’s Code of Good Practices
on Fiscal Transparency and sets best practice standards in many areas. The U.S. constitution
provides a strong and well-tested framework that clearly defines the roles of the executive and
legislative branches in fiscal management. The Congress plays a central role in shaping the
budget, which ensures a highly open process. State and local governments also have clearly
defined fiscal responsibilities, operating independently from the federal government, and they are
subject to market discipline. Budget documentation is easily accessible to the public, timely,
comprehensive, and reliable, and it excels in its scope and quality of analysis.

•

Nevertheless, there remains a lack of clarity about the longer-term direction of fiscal policy.
This partly reflects the sheer size of the federal government and the complexity of the
Congressional budget process. Major efforts have been made over the past three decades to put in
place a legal framework to strengthen this aspect of the budget process. However, with the
expiration of the Budget Enforcement Act (BEA), the failure of Congress to pass a budget
resolution for FY 2003, and the recent uncertainty regarding the permanence of tax cuts and the
costs of the war in Iraq, budget decisions do not seem presently guided by clear medium- and
long-term fiscal policy objectives.

•

Budget responsibility legislation to replace the BEA could help provide a basis for a more
systematic incorporation of longer-term considerations into the budget process. Building on
existing budget requirements and practices, such a budget framework could require: the
specification and justification of medium-term fiscal targets as part of the President’s budget; a
budget report on long-term fiscal policy; discretionary spending caps and pay-as-you-go
(PAYGO) requirements for mandatory spending and revenue; and clearer procedures for
specifying and disclosing key budget assumptions (e.g., with respect to expiring legislation).

•

Fiscal transparency could be strengthened in a number of additional ways. These include:
reporting an internationally comparable measure of the budget balance to supplement the unified
budget presentation; providing an overview of state and local government finances as part of the
federal budget presentation; an annual assessment of the costs and risks associated with the quasifiscal activities; including a comprehensive statement on fiscal risks in budget documents;
reconsidering the legal basis for tax expenditure reporting; ensuring that audit reports of agencies
by the General Accounting Office (GAO) are followed up, possibly by a standing public accounts
committee that reports to Congress; an increased emphasis on program performance; and greater
attention to the full cost of providing government services.

stated goal two years ago—over the next five to ten years would significantly lower total
federal debt (including obligations to the Social Security and Medicare trust funds) ahead of
the coming demographic shift. Such an adjustment would provide the time that would likely
be needed to design and phase in the measures to address the longer-term insolvency of the
entitlement programs. Although spending cuts could represent an important component of the
consolidation strategy, it was difficult to see how significant savings could be achieved, given
the absence of well-defined supporting policies and pressures to boost outlays on defense and
other Administration priorities. These considerations and the sizable adjustment that would be
needed—over 3 percent of GDP—suggested that revenue enhancements also would be needed,
preferably by broadening the tax base.11
45.
The authorities were not convinced of the need for a more stringent medium-term
fiscal objective. They noted that the Budget had already indicated the preference for a balanced
budget, including Social Security, and the Budget’s projections were consistent with the deficit
approaching zero in five to ten years if the favorable supply-side effects of the tax cuts were
factored in. In their view, the size of the unfunded liabilities of the retirement and health care
were far too large to solve by simply paying down debt, and the problem needed to be
addressed directly by reforming these programs over time. In the meantime, they observed that
budget deficits in the 2–3 percent of GDP range were still consistent with a stable debt ratio,
and the Administration was committed to making the May 2003 tax cuts permanent and to
introducing further reductions in tax rates.
46.
The mission stressed that early action was needed to reform the Social Security
system. A range of options could be considered, including increases in contribution rates,
hikes in retirement ages, amendments to indexation formulas, and other programmatic
changes. However, measures typically had to be phased in slowly—in order to allow
participants to adjust their saving behavior—and delays would only make the necessary
adjustments more painful.12 U.S. officials acknowledged that little progress had been made
toward building a consensus for reform since the report of the President’s reform commission
had reported in late 2001, but the Administration still strongly favored approaches that
provided a role for personal retirement accounts, avoided hikes in contribution rates, and did
not disadvantage current and near retirees. They expected that the 2004 elections might
provide a useful forum for debating these politically difficult issues.

11

OECD estimates put corporate and personal income tax expenditures at almost 8 percent of GDP and also
suggest significant gains from further increasing taxes on energy consumption.

12

Staff calculations suggest that an immediate 3.9 percentage point increase in contribution rates would cover the
unfunded liability of the trust funds, but a 4.9 percentage point increase would be required if the measures were
delayed by 10 years.

- 25 -

47.
The authorities recognized the need to reform Medicare and Medicaid and placed a
priority on expanding the role of the private sector in administering benefits in order to
contain costs. For this reason, they had proposed that prescription drug benefits be provided
by private plans. The Administration had

48.
Discussions with officials suggested that structural reforms would be needed to
resolve the fiscal crisis among the states. Officials stressed that federal policies—including
recent tax cuts and reforms to transfer programs—had not significantly disadvantaged the
states. The underlying problem was that the states’ balanced budget rules had led them to
respond to the boom in revenues during the late 1990s by cutting taxes and boosting
outlays on social programs. As a consequence, they had been unprepared for the sharp drop
in income tax receipts that followed the collapse of the equity price bubble. The mission
cautioned, however, that the proposal to shift the funding of state Medicaid programs from
a cost-sharing to a block-grant basis could leave the states even more ill-prepared to cope
with demographic pressures and suggested that it would be important to coordinate Medicare
and Medicaid reform proposals with the states.
D. Financial Sector Issues
49.
U.S. officials observed that the banking system had remained resilient in the face of
the economic slowdown (Table 6). In their view, although a weaker macroeconomic
environment or other shocks could adversely affect earnings, the safety and soundness of the
system were not at risk. They were mindful of the potential for an eventual return of interest
rates to more neutral levels to have adverse balance sheet effects, especially in the case of
smaller and mid-sized banks that were less active in hedging exposures. However, bank risk
management was sound; the recent growth of core, low interest rate deposits provided a
natural hedge; and rate increases would likely only occur in the context of an improved
economic setting. The increased use of credit derivatives, syndications, and loan sales had
also helped contain credit risks. Officials discounted the possibility of significant
deterioration in mortgage portfolios, but acknowledged that the recent growth of home
equity lines of credit, as well as the commercial real estate sector, could pose risks.

- 26 -

50.
U.S. officials expressed confidence that the two large government sponsored
enterprises (GSEs) did not currently pose significant systemic risks. In addition to their
more traditional role in securitizing mortgages for purchase by other investors, since the mid1990s Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac have issued significant amounts of debt to fund
purchases of mortgage-backed securities, raising concern that the enterprises could exercise
undue market power or pose systemic risks.13 Officials emphasized, however, that the GSEs
were subject to stress tests, and most markets for interest rate derivatives were deep and
liquid enough to meet their hedging needs, at least for the present time. They acknowledged
that the enterprises’ rapid growth at least partly reflected the low cost of borrowing that their
special status provided, as well as the perception that they were implicitly backed by the
government or were “too big to fail.” However, it was not clear that simply limiting their size
would reduce systemic risks.
51.
Officials suggested that the Basel II capital accord would yield both opportunities
and challenges. The internal ratings based (IRB) approach was expected to improve risk
management and to make capital requirements more risk sensitive, but implementation would
be resource-intensive for both banks and supervisors. Since care would be needed to avoid an
over-reliance on statistical models in managing risk, Basel II also incorporates enhanced
supervisory review and increased disclosure. In order to avoid undue cost and complexity, the
United States had opted for a somewhat limited application of Basel II; the new system
would be required only of large, internationally active banks, and only the advanced IRB
approach would be used. At least initially, this would mean that the new system would be
required of around ten banks, although a similar number of other large banks would likely
find it advantageous to adopt the new system voluntarily. Nonetheless, questions also had
been raised—including in Congress— about whether the system’s calibration would
disadvantage some institutions.
52.
Progress has been made in strengthening corporate governance and auditor
oversight. The officials suggested that important factors explaining the corporate malfeasance
of recent years seemed to have been weak corporate governance structures, compounded by
questionable accounting practices and executive compensation schemes that provided undue
incentives to boost short-term share prices, even at the expense of longer-term value. The
Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 had responded to these and other concerns by calling for
measures, among other things, to increase penalties for fraud and by establishing the Public
Company Accounting Oversight Board (PCAOB) to regulate the audit profession. The selfregulatory organizations (e.g., NYSE and NASD) had also introduced new rules to strengthen
corporate governance and transparency, including by stiffening the rules governing the
independence of company directors, equity-based compensation schemes, and the role and
responsibility of audit committees.
13

Although GSE debt is explicitly not backed by the government, the GSEs benefit from a $2.5 billion credit line
with the U.S. Treasury; their debt is exempt from restrictions on banks that limit the amount of securities issued by
any single issuer that they may hold; their securities are exempt from SEC registration requirements; and GSE
earnings are exempt from state and local income taxes. In addition, these agencies are overseen by a separate
federal regulator and are subject to Congressionally mandated capital requirements.

53.
Officials agreed, however, that important issues still needed to be addressed. The
Chairman of the PCAOB was appointed in April 2003, and the process of registering
accounting firms and establishing the rules that would govern their work was still in train. In
addition, the Financial Accounting Standards Board has issued new accounting guidance on
special purpose entities and guarantees and is pursuing projects related to the accounting for
stock compensation and enhancing the disclosure of pension liabilities. Officials emphasized
that they were mindful of the international implications of these efforts and that regulators
were making efforts to be flexible in the application of new requirements to foreign firms.
54.
The mission observed that the underfunding of defined-benefit (DB) corporate
pension plans posed important financial, regulatory, and accounting issues.14 Severe
underfunding had compounded the financial difficulties of a number of firms, particularly
within the automotive, steel, and airline industries. The failure of several steel firms with
large pension obligations had also put a strain on the financial position of the Pension Benefit
Guarantee Corporation (PBGC). The officials indicated that current accounting rules allowed
firms to smooth pension plan gains and losses to limit the impact of short-term asset price
movements, which could obscure firms’ underlying financial position, and there was scope
for improving the transparency of pension plan results and required contributions. The PBGC
was also exploring options for improving its financial position, but officials noted that its
shortfall was modest and likely would be erased once the economy strengthened.
E. Energy, Trade, and Other Policy Issues
55.
The Administration’s 2001 National Energy Policy has triggered important debate
in Congress. Different versions of an Energy Bill currently before the House and Senate are
principally aimed at reducing U.S. energy dependence by boosting supply. Measures include:
tax incentives for new technologies, increased funding for research into alternative fuels and
technologies, deregulation of wholesale electricity markets, and easing restrictions on oil and
gas exploration in ecologically sensitive areas. The mission suggested that demand-side
measures, including energy-related taxes, might also assist in supporting environmental and
fiscal objectives.15 U.S. officials stressed that it was important to strike an appropriate
balance between long-term growth and environmental concerns. For this reason, the emphasis
was not simply on curbing energy consumption, which would dampen growth, but on marketoriented policies that would balance supply and demand and help meet environmental
objectives. They noted, in particular, the Administration’s commitment to reduce greenhouse
gas emissions by 18 percent by 2012, which they hoped to achieve through voluntary
measures, to develop a tradable permit system for emissions, and to provide tax incentives for
the production of energy from renewable sources.

See the forthcoming Selected Issues paper for details.

The forthcoming Selected Issues paper compares U.S. energy taxation with that in other countries, and
illustrates that a 10 percentage point increase in energy taxes would lower real GDP by less than 0.1 percent.

- 28 -

56.
The mission stressed the importance of U.S. commitment to the multilateral process
and its leadership in fostering progress toward a successful completion of the Doha
Round. The mission noted, in particular, the need to find common ground with partner
countries in areas such as the public health exemption on TRIPs and also called for early
action to comply with recent WTO rulings on the safeguard duties on steel imports, rebates of
anti-dumping duties and the tax treatment of Foreign Sales Corporations. The USTR
representatives responded that the authorities remained committed to trade liberalization and
moving the Round forward. In this regard, they noted the Administration’s success in gaining
Congressional support for Trade Promotion Authority and, in the context of the Doha Round,
far-reaching proposals had been made for liberalization in most areas.
57.
The mission asked about the prospects for resolving difficult sector-specific issues,
especially in light of last year’s Farm Bill and the safeguard duties imposed on steel
imports and their impact on developing countries.16 The USTR representatives agreed that
agricultural subsidies represented a potential stumbling block for the WTO negotiations but
underlined that the Farm Bill would not be an obstacle to liberalization. The U.S. proposal
would cut the global average tariff on agricultural products from 62 percent to 15 percent and
reduce global trade distorting support by over $100 billion. As for the steel sector, the
domestic industry was in the process of restructuring, and discussions were under way within
the OECD on how to reduce global excess capacity. Although many of the most sensitive
textiles quotas were still in place, the U.S. textiles sector had also made considerable
adjustment in advance of their expiration at end-2004. Responding to the mission’s concern
about the continued use of anti-dumping and countervailing duty remedies, they argued that
U.S. practice was transparent and WTO compliant; more worrisome was the increasing resort
to such remedies in other countries where the process was nontransparent.
58.
The mission asked about the implications of the U.S. emphasis on regional and
bilateral free trade arrangements (FTAs) for the multilateral trading system (Box 6). In
particular, while such arrangements could bring substantial benefits to the countries involved,
it was important to ensure that they were designed in a manner that limited trade diversion
and avoided administrative complexity, and that they did not undermine the momentum
toward multilateral liberalization, including by diverting scarce negotiating capacity in other
countries. The mission also cautioned that the investment provisions of recent FTAs could
limit the flexibility of countries in controlling the pace of capital flows in the event of crises.
59.
The USTR representatives responded that they viewed bilateral and regional FTAs
as an important complement to their multilateral strategy of “competitive liberalization.”
Negotiating trade arrangements with a smaller number of partners meant that there was scope
for deeper liberalization, including in services, investment, and regulatory matters, which
helped set a higher standard for subsequent agreements and the multilateral negotiations.
16

The 2002 Selected Issues paper contained detailed analysis of the multilateral implications of the U.S. Farm
Bill and steel tariffs.

Box 6. U.S. Macroeconomic Developments and Trade Policies—Multilateral
Implications1
•

Global linkages between the United States and the rest of the world have grown rapidly in recent
decades. International trade—the sum of exports and imports—has grown at roughly three times the rate of
GDP in the United States since 1960, and gross cross-border financial flows have risen from less than
3 percent to more than 18 percent of GDP since the early 1980s.

•

Stronger trade and financial linkages have increased the extent of macroeconomic spillovers. For
example, staff estimates show that the comovement of business cycles in the United States and in other G-7
countries has increased in recent decades, and the role of global factors in explaining individual country
business cycles has become more pronounced. The United States has also been an important driver of these
global factors, with the correlation between U.S. output growth and the median global factor at 0.62.2

•

The important role played by trade arrangements for cross-border trade, financial flows, and growth is
illustrated by the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA). Since the inception of NAFTA in
1994, U.S. exports to its NAFTA partners have climbed nearly 90 percent, and Mexico’s exports to the
United States and Canada have tripled. FDI flows to Mexico increased from $12 billion over 1991–1993 to
roughly $54 billion in 2000–2002. Recent estimates indicate that NAFTA membership helped boost annual
FDI inflows to Mexico by roughly 40 percent, and that NAFTA has contributed significantly to
employment and productivity growth in Mexico.3

•

Staff analysis suggests that free trade arrangements (FTAs) such as NAFTA have important
implications for business cycle dynamics. Since the advent of NAFTA, the co-movement of real GDP and
other important macroeconomic aggregates of the member countries has increased markedly. Estimates
from a dynamic factor model suggest that the proportion of GDP variability in Mexico explained by
regional (versus country-specific) shocks has increased from 1 percent in the period 1980-1993 to more
than 19 percent during 1994-2002.

•

These issues have become increasingly important with the greater emphasis that has been placed by the
United States on regional and bilateral FTAs. A Free Trade Area of the Americas is planned for the
United States and 33 other countries in the Western Hemisphere by the end of 2005. The United States
signed FTAs with Chile and Singapore in 2003 and has also begun FTA negotiations with Morocco,
Central America, the Southern African Customs Union, and Australia. Work has begun on a broad-based
trade initiative in the Middle East, and preferential market access has been provided through the Andean
Trade Preferences Act and the African Growth and Opportunity Act.

•

Model simulations illustrate the potential benefits of regional and bilateral FTAs. Stylized
representations of the U.S.-Chile, U.S.-Australia, and U.S.-Central America arrangements suggest that
export performance improves for partner countries in areas of comparative advantage but that welfare
losses can result owing to trade diversion (unambiguously so for non-members). The results suggest that
the maximum benefits from participation in FTAs occur if they are used as a stepping stone to lowering
trade barriers with other partners. In addition, FTAs are likely to have benefits in areas such as services
trade and investment that are not captured by conventional trade models.

Bilateral arrangements also were viewed as helpful in supporting overseas development. The
USTR representatives agreed, however, that bilateral arrangements could create coordination
problems, and technical assistance was being provided to assist in negotiations.
60.
Despite recent increases, U.S. official development assistance (ODA) remains at
only 0.12 percent of GNP, the lowest ratio among industrial countries. The staff
representatives welcomed the Administration’s recent commitment to boost ODA, including
for the Millennium Challenge Account (MCA) and the Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief.17
The U.S. representatives noted that the MCA, in particular, was geared toward improving the
effectiveness of ODA by disbursing funds to countries on the basis of clearly defined criteria
that demonstrated their institutional capacity as well as effective management of social and
economic policies. Although the number of countries that would meet this test would be
limited, concentrating ODA on good performers was likely to improve its overall
effectiveness. At the same time, however, the traditional ODA budget would remain available
for those countries unable to meet the MCA criteria.
61.
The U.S. officials noted that efforts had intensified in the area of anti-money
laundering (AML) enforcement and combating the financing of terrorism (CFT).
Substantial progress has been made to implement the USA PATRIOT Act during the past
year, and guidelines were being established to help quantify progress in the AML/CFT area.18
A priority was also being placed on collaboration with other countries and international
institutions to encourage greater harmonization of AML/CFT regulations. The U.S. officials
acknowledged that the United States was still not in full compliance with some of the
Financial Action Task Force recommendations, but they were confident that this would be
achieved in two years.
IV. STAFF APPRAISAL
62.
Despite repeated shocks in recent years, the U.S. economy has provided valuable
support for global growth. The relative strength of the U.S. economy has reflected the
exceptional stimulus provided by monetary and fiscal policies, as well as the economy’s
remarkable resilience and flexibility, which has contributed to continued productivity growth.
63.
However, the recovery has been uneven, and short-term prospects remain
uncertain. Growth is expected to rise above its potential rate in the latter half of 2003 and
into 2004, with the relatively quick resolution of the Iraq war, lower oil prices, and further
17

The MCA—which is expected to receive funding rising from $1.3 billion in FY 2004 to $5 billion by
FY 2006—would provide grants targeted to a limited set of countries meeting well-defined performance criteria.
The Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief would commit $2 billion in FY 2004 and $15 billion over the next five
years for large-scale AIDS/HIV prevention and treatment efforts in developing countries.
18

In June 2002, the Administration released its second National Money Laundering Strategy, which provided a
detailed account of the progress made and described a comprehensive framework to combat money laundering.

- 31 -

support from monetary and fiscal policies. However, it remains to be seen whether the
adjustments associated with the unwinding of the equity price bubble have fully run their
course, and downside risks remain a concern given the continued weakness of industrial
activity, employment, and the proximity of the zero bound on interest rates.
64.
Recent tax cuts have reduced the room for further fiscal policy maneuver and
heightened concern regarding long-term sustainability. While fiscal policies have helped
support the recovery so far, tax cuts have left the fiscal position even less prepared to cope
with the retirement of the baby-boom generation later this decade. Sustained fiscal deficits
would eventually crowd out investment and erode U.S. productivity growth. They would also
tend to boost the already large U.S. current account deficit, imposing a further drain on global
saving and increasing the risk of disorderly exchange market conditions.
65.
Against this background, the key task is to manage short-term risks to the outlook,
while establishing a credible approach to dealing with the longer-term fiscal problem.
Responding effectively to this challenge will help promote growth as well as domestic and
external sustainability, in line with the G-7 finance ministers’ commitment to cooperate to
promote global economic growth.
66.
While monetary policy has responded aggressively to the economic slowdown,
further easing may still be required if the recovery does not regain momentum. The FOMC
has appropriately signaled its readiness to act further, if necessary, and its willingness to use a
broader range of policy instruments should deflationary pressures intensify. A quantified
statement of the Federal Reserve’s inflation objective could further anchor inflation
expectations, which might be especially helpful now that interest rates have moved close to
zero and deflation is a concern.
67.
The dollar’s recent weakness has added to uncertainty. The authorities have
correctly emphasized that exchange rates have responded to market forces and that foreign
exchange market intervention has little enduring influence. Indeed, the dollar’s depreciation
represents a step toward bringing the U.S. current account deficit to a more sustainable
position. However, an abrupt weakening of investor sentiment and turbulent exchange market
conditions would have adverse consequences, both domestically and abroad. A firm
commitment to reducing the U.S. fiscal deficit over the medium term, as well as strong
growth among partner countries, would help to ensure that the eventual adjustment of the
U.S. current account deficit is orderly and rests on a strengthening of national saving rather
than weaker U.S. investment and growth.
68.
The priority for fiscal policy should be to establish a credible framework for
returning the budget to balance, excluding Social Security, over the medium term and to
place retirement and health care systems on a sound financial footing. Although the
deficit/GDP ratio is projected to narrow somewhat in coming years, these projections are
based on assumptions—including a sharp improvement in tax receipts and strict limits on
discretionary outlays, excluding defense and homeland security—that may prove optimistic,

- 32 -

especially since supporting policies to ensure strict limits on discretionary spending have yet
to be defined. Moreover, the retirement of the baby-boom generation will place increasing
pressure on the Social Security and Medicare systems in coming decades, and the unfunded
actuarial liability of these programs is substantial. Balancing the budget, excluding Social
Security, over the next five to ten years would enable a substantial reduction in the debt ratio
ahead of this demographic shift and provide greater room to implement the needed reform of
entitlement programs.
69.
Tax and expenditure policies will need to be geared toward ensuring a sustainable
fiscal position. In this context, the recent tax package has added to uncertainty about the
future paths of tax rates and is unlikely to boost output in a sustained manner unless its
adverse budgetary impact is offset over the medium term. Meeting the fiscal costs of
population aging will eventually require revenue increases—preferably through base
broadening measures—and sustained spending restraints.
70.
Re-introducing the Budget Enforcement Act (BEA) disciplines would help ensure
that these medium-term trade-offs are faced squarely and that policies are consistent with
fiscal sustainability. The federal budget is highly transparent and represents best practice in
many areas. However, the sharp increase in discretionary spending in recent years, and the
use of sunsets and other devices to obscure the longer-term budgetary consequences of tax
cuts, have raised questions about the adequacy of fiscal discipline. The BEA disciplines, if
restored and strengthened further, could usefully support the fiscal adjustment that is needed
in the period ahead, particularly if accompanied by broader efforts to re-establish a political
consensus for budget balance.
71.
Steps should be initiated soon to strengthen the financial position of the Social
Security and Medicare systems. In the case of the Social Security system, relatively modest
changes in the system—including amendments to indexation formulas, increases in the
retirement age, or hikes in contributions rates—would be sufficient to close projected
shortfalls. However, such measures take considerable time to phase in, and the longer
decisions are delayed, the larger and more painful the adjustments will be required. The
financial position of the Medicare system is considerably worse, given the rapid growth of
health care costs and the modest share of benefits that are covered by individual
contributions. In these circumstances, any measures to enrich benefits, including for
prescription drugs, should be accompanied by credible measures to address the system’s
longer-term financial problems. Especially in view of the fiscal pressures faced by state and
local governments, proposed reforms to Medicaid funding will need to take into account the
growing pressures on the system from population aging and its impact on Medicare.
72.
Energy policies that operate on the demand-side—as well as the supply-side—
would help support both environmental and fiscal objectives. Current proposals embodied
in the Energy Bill aim to boost U.S. energy production and reduce emissions intensity,
principally through tax and other incentives for businesses. Measures that directly target
consumers—including energy-related taxes—also could be effective in aligning energy

- 33 -

demand and supply and achieving emissions goals, while contributing to longer-term
budgetary objectives.
73.
Financial sector balance sheets have held up well, and corporate profitability seems
to be recovering. However, care will be needed to ensure that banks are well-positioned to
absorb the effect on balance sheets of an eventual turnaround in interest rates or a possible
cooling of conditions in the real estate market. In view of the rapid growth and systemic
importance of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, the authorities will need to monitor closely risk
management and accounting practices by these agencies and ensure that disclosure is
adequate. There would also seem merit in taking action to further limit these agencies’
special status and discourage the market perception of an implicit government guarantee of
their liabilities.
74.
Considerable progress has been made toward strengthening accounting standards
and corporate governance. The remaining challenge is to ensure that the responsible
agencies are provided with sufficient resources and support to complete the reform agenda.
Key tasks include: pressing ahead with improvements in the accounting of stock options;
ensuring the independence of corporate boards; and achieving greater harmony between
U.S. and international accounting standards. The significant underfunding of defined-benefit
corporate pension plans that has emerged in recent years also points to the need to strengthen
the accounting, transparency, and funding of these plans, as well as the finances of the
Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation.
75.
The United States should continue to play an important leadership role in
promoting trade liberalization. A more open and liberal trade system has enormous potential
for fostering growth in all countries, and the United States has already made useful proposals
for moving the Doha Round forward. However, concerted efforts will still be needed to find
common ground with partner countries in a range of difficult areas, and the authorities are
also encouraged to take early action to comply with recent WTO rulings. Ongoing
negotiations of bilateral and regional free-trade agreements have the potential to bring
substantial benefits to the partner countries involved. At the same time, it is essential that
such initiatives complement broader multilateral efforts toward liberalization and are
designed in a manner that limits trade diversion and administrative complexities.
76.
There are important opportunities to better align U.S. trade and other domestic
policies with the broader commitment to development. U.S. development assistance as a
share of GNP still remains among the lowest among the industrial countries, and larger
increases in foreign assistance would still be desirable. There also remains scope for
improving the complementarities between development and trade policies, including by
reducing subsidies to U.S. agricultural producers and by more ambitious efforts to eliminate
remaining non-tariff barriers to imports from developing countries.
77.
It is recommended that the next Article IV consultation take place within the standard
12-month cycle.

APPENDIX III

United States—Debt Sustainability
1.
This appendix subjects projections for U.S. public debt and net external liabilities
to a series of macroeconomic stress tests.1 Following the methodology prescribed in
“Assessing Sustainability,” SM/02/166 (May 28, 2002), a baseline trajectory for these two
debt variables is determined by setting key macroeconomic variables, including the primary
fiscal deficit and the non-interest current account balance, at their average rates for the last
ten years. The fiscal baseline is then subjected to two-standard deviation shocks in domestic
interest rates, real growth and the primary fiscal deficit, each lasting two years before the
variable returns to normal. For external debt, similar shocks are assumed for real growth,
domestic prices, the foreign interest rate, and the non-interest current account balance.
2.
The exercise focuses on short- to medium-term vulnerabilities for the general
government. Accordingly, net general government debt is defined by combining the net
financial liabilities of federal, state, and local government debt to the public (that is,
excluding government debt held by the social insurance trust funds). Under the baseline, the
general government primary fiscal deficit is set at 2.2 percent of GDP—i.e., the average of
almost a decade of fiscal consolidation and considerably more optimistic than the staff’s
actual fiscal forecast.2 Correspondingly, net general government debt is projected to decline
to below 50 percent of GDP by 2008 (Figure 1a).
3.
Shocks to the fiscal baseline do not lead to a reversal in the downward path of
public debt. Under each shock, the debt-to-GDP ratio returns to a downward trajectory after
an initial jump in the first two years. The greatest vulnerability is with regard to interest rates
and real GDP growth—both shocks induce a temporary increase in the debt ratio in 2003 and
2004 and leave the 2008 ratio more than 10 percent of GDP above the baseline.
4.
Shocks to the external baseline all imply a faster accumulation of foreign debt by
2008 (Figure 1b). In the baseline scenario, the ratio of net external liabilities to GDP
increases from 22 percent in 2002 to 32 percent in 2008. Interest rates would again have the
largest influence on debt accumulation, but external debt would reach above 40 percent of
GDP in all simulated cases. These simulations reflect the higher historical volatility of the
external variables, which increases the magnitude of the two standard deviation shocks.
5.
In addition to these stress tests, a vector autoregression (VAR) model was also
considered, which broadly confirmed the results of the standard stress tests above.3 The
VAR approach has the advantage of providing a statistically-driven forecast of the debt ratios
1

Net external liabilities equal the U.S. net international investment position.

2

The baseline also projects real GDP growth of 3.3 percent through 2008; inflation would average 2 percent;
and the real interest rate on general government debt is projected at 4½ percent.

3

The VAR model for public debt includes the ratio of primary government deficit-to-GDP, real GDP, inflation,
real effective exchange rate, three-month, and 10-year interest rates. The model for external debt has the same
variables, except that it replaces the primary deficit with the current account balance.

APPENDIX III

along with an explicit confidence interval for the outcome. The projections confirm the
underlying trends in public and external debt, especially the upward trend in net external
liabilities. The results also illustrate the considerable uncertainty that attaches to such
projections—for the government debt projections the two standard deviation range was
roughly plus or minus 15 percent of GDP by 2008, and for external debt the confidence
interval was roughly plus or minus 10 percent of GDP.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND
UNITED STATES OF AMERICA
Staff Report for the 2003 Article IV Consultation
Supplementary Information
Prepared by the Western Hemisphere Department
Approved by Charles Collyns
July 29, 2003
1.
This supplement reports on information that has become available since the staff
report (SM/03/239) was issued. Topics covered include recent economic and financial
developments, the Federal Reserve’s Monetary Policy Report to Congress, and the
Administration’s Mid-Session Review of the Budget. These developments do not affect the
staff appraisal.
Recent economic and financial market developments
2.
Recent indicators are broadly consistent with the staff and consensus projections
for the economy to gather momentum in the second half of 2003. Manufacturing
production rose by 0.4 percent in June, following a 0.1 percent increase in May, reflecting
strength in the output of both consumer goods and business equipment. Retail sales rose in
June by 0.5 percent, and by 0.7 percent excluding automobiles. A 5.3 percent increase in
housing starts in June suggests that residential investment will strengthen in the third quarter.
Durable goods orders also rose by 2.1 percent, albeit partly reflecting the effects of a large
order for passenger airplanes. The drop in initial jobless claims in early July, as well as recent
diffusion indices of employment intentions, indicate that employment conditions are
beginning to turn around. However, consumer confidence fell sharply in July and net external
demand still appears weak, with the May trade deficit rising further to $41.8 billion, as export
volumes remain at a low level (especially of capital goods) and import volumes have
continued to strengthen.
3.
Inflation remains subdued. Although the consumer price index rose 0.2 percent in
June, this increase largely reflected the effects of higher gasoline and food prices. The core
index was unchanged, however, and increased by only 0.9 percent (annual rate) during the
first half of the year.
4.
Financial markets developments have reflected improved confidence in the U.S.
recovery. Yields on the 10-year Treasury bonds, which had fallen to 3.1 percent in mid-June,
have since rebounded to over 4¼ percent, reflecting market perceptions that deflation risks,

-2-

and the possibility that the Federal Reserve might intervene to lower longer-term yields, had
diminished. Stock prices have been mixed in recent weeks.
Monetary Policy Report to Congress
5.
The Federal Reserve Board’s semi-annual Monetary Policy Report was presented
to the Congress on July 15. The macroeconomic projections contained in the report showed
real GDP growth rebounding strongly from 2¼–2¾ percent in 2003 (fourth quarter to fourth
quarter) to 3¾–4¾ percent in 2004, although the unemployment rate would remain in the
range of 6–6¼ percent in both years.1 Inflation—as measured by the price index for personal
consumption expenditure (PCE)—was projected to remain at 1¼–1½ percent in 2003 and
1–1½ percent in 2004.
6.
In his testimony, Chairman Greenspan signaled that policy would remain
accommodative as long as needed. He noted that there were several reasons to suggest that
economic activity would pick up in coming quarters, including the support to demand
provided by low interest rates and the housing market; the lift to disposable incomes expected
from the recent tax cuts; and signs that investment was beginning to rebound. However, he
also flagged that downside risks remained, highlighting the surge in natural gas prices and
lethargic growth among partner countries. Although deflation risks were characterized as
remote, he stressed the importance of preventing too low an inflation rate and that “the
FOMC stood ready to maintain a highly accommodative stance of policy for as long as it
takes to achieve a return to satisfactory economic performance.”
Mid-Session Review of the Budget
7.
The Administration’s Mid-Session Review (MSR) of the Budget was released on
July 15 and showed a marked further deterioration in the budget position (Table 1).
Mainly reflecting a further weakening of revenue buoyancies, increased military spending,
and greater-than-expected front-loading of the Jobs and Growth Act, the deficits expected in
FY 2003 and FY 2004 were raised to 4¼ percent of GDP, roughly 1¼ percentage points
higher than the projections released in February. The deficit is still forecast to fall sharply in
subsequent years, based on the assumption of strict limits on non-defense spending and a
rebound in revenues. Nonetheless, the deficit is expected to remain at 1¾ percent of GDP in
FY 2008, roughly ½ percentage point higher than previously anticipated.
8.
The MSR continued to characterize the fiscal situation as manageable. While
acknowledging that the deficit was large and a legitimate cause for concern, the MSR noted
that the deficits projected were “well below the postwar peak of 6.0 percent of GDP.”

1

The mid-point of the FOMC’s growth projection for 2004 is roughly ½ percentage point higher than the staff’s
projection.

-3-

Government-sponsored enterprises
9.
An internal investigation of accounting irregularities at Freddie Mac—which had
been commissioned by the enterprise’s Board—was released in July, following the removal
in June of several senior officers of the company. The report raised concerns regarding
accounting policy and the reporting of specific derivatives transactions, the adequacy of
internal control, governance practices, and disclosure policies. While the report suggested
that there had been an inappropriate emphasis on transactions geared toward “income
smoothing,” it did not suggest that this had adversely affected risk management. A House
subcommittee, as well as the Securities and Exchange Commission, are investigating these
issues, which have also prompted legislative proposals to replace the Office of Federal
Housing Enterprise Oversight with a new agency under the Treasury Department.

IMF Concludes 2003 Article IV Consultation with the United States
On July 30, 2003, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded the
Article IV consultation with the United States.1
Background
After experiencing one of the largest stock market declines in the post-war period and then
falling into recession in March 2001, the U.S. economy was buffeted by a series of further
shocks, including the September 11th attacks, major corporate failures, additional stock price
declines, and the war in Iraq. Remarkably, the recession was mild and short-lived, with output
declining only ½ percent in the first three quarters of 2001.
The recovery, however, has been uneven and sluggish. Growth slowed markedly at the end of
2002 and early 2003, the unemployment rate jumped to just over 6¼ percent in June 2003, and
the output gap has widened. Reflecting these developments, the core CPI inflation rate has
drifted downward to under 1½ percent, a level not seen since the mid-1960s—prompting
concern in early 2003 of the risk of deflation.
Both monetary and fiscal policies have provided unprecedented support to the recovery. The
target for the federal funds rate was reduced by a cumulative 475 basis points during 2001, a
further 50 basis points in November 2002, and an additional 25 basis points in June 2003. The
dollar’s depreciation since early 2002, the decline in long-term interest rates, and the more
recent firming of stock prices have also helped ease financial conditions.

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On
return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the
Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the
Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the
country's authorities.

-2On the fiscal front, substantial reductions in income tax rates were legislated in June 2001;
March 2002 legislation increased investment incentives and extended unemployment benefits;
defense and security-related spending was increased significantly in 2002 and 2003; and
substantial additional tax cuts were legislated in May 2003. These measures contributed to a
massive shift in the federal government’s unified budget balance, from a surplus of 2½ percent
of GDP in FY 2000 (October–September) to a deficit likely to exceed 4 percent of GDP in
FY 2003. With the economic slowdown also weighing heavily on revenues at the state and local
level, the combined balance of the general government could reach a deficit of 6 percent of
GDP in 2003.
Against this background, household demand has remained resilient. Reflecting the effects of
low interest rates, the boom in home prices, and strong growth in disposable incomes, both
consumption and residential investment have provided valuable support to domestic demand.
At the same time, households were able to boost their saving rate—which had fallen to around
2 percent prior to the recession—to around 3½ percent in early 2003.
By contrast, business fixed investment, which had plummeted from historical highs relative to
GDP during 2000-01, has been much weaker than in past recoveries. Business equipment and
software purchases had begun to rebound somewhat in the last three quarters of 2002, but
have since softened, while a sharp increase in industrial vacancy rates has continued to weigh
on nonresidential structures investment.
Nonetheless, productivity growth has remained robust and financial market confidence has
improved. This partly reflected aggressive labor shedding in 2002, which helped yield a
2 percent decline in unit labor costs and a 4¾ percent surge in productivity—the fastest annual
rate in over 50 years. As a result, profits have begun to recover and the increased risk aversion
triggered by accounting scandals and the uncertainty during the buildup to the Iraq war appears
to have eased considerably. Reflecting improved confidence, equity markets have rallied since
April and bond spreads have narrowed.
However, weak demand abroad and the earlier strength of the U.S. dollar have weighed heavily
on the economy. Export volumes began to recover modestly in 2002, but fell again toward the
end of the year and in early 2003 and remain at a low ebb. By contrast, import volumes
rebounded strongly in 2002, reflecting purchases of consumer goods and industrial supplies.
These factors, as well as higher world oil prices, helped to push the current account deficit to a
record 5¼ percent of GDP in 2003Q1. With less favorable interest rate differentials and weaker
global sentiment toward U.S. equities, private capital inflows fell. Although this was offset by
slower investment abroad by U.S. residents and increased purchases of U.S. dollar assets by
foreign central banks, the dollar depreciated in nominal effective terms by around 15 percent
between February 2002 and June 2003.
The staff projects activity to gather momentum in the latter half of 2003, with GDP growth rising
from around 2¼ percent in 2003 to 3½ percent in 2004. Consumer sentiment has improved with
the quick end to the Iraq war, and household demand would be further supported by additional
tax cuts, the rebound in stock prices, low interest rates, and the easing of oil prices. These
same factors, as well as strong productivity growth, are also expected to allow profits and
business fixed investment to gather strength into 2004. The drag from net exports would wane
into 2004, reflecting gradual recoveries abroad and the lagged effects of the dollar’s

-3depreciation, and the current account deficit would start to narrow somewhat from around
5 percent of GDP in 2003. With economic slack remaining significant, headline CPI inflation is
projected to fall to around 1¼ percent in 2004, before rebounding somewhat as the output gap
closes.
Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors highlighted the valuable support that the U.S. economy has given to global
growth, reflecting the economy’s remarkable resilience and flexibility in the face of severe
shocks, and the exceptional stimulus provided by U.S. monetary and fiscal policies. Directors
welcomed the recent signs that the recovery appears to be gathering momentum, with improved
prospects for stronger growth in the second half of 2003 and into 2004. At the same time,
however, they noted that the recovery has thus far been uneven, and that downside risks
remain. These risks reflect uncertainties regarding the strength of business investment, the
extent to which adjustments associated with the unwinding of the equity price bubble have fully
run their course, and the support that can be expected from the global environment. Many
Directors also pointed to possible developments, especially in the housing market, that might
affect the strength of household demand.
Looking ahead, Directors agreed that the long-term growth prospects for the U.S. economy
remain strong, supported by its flexibility, which has contributed to high productivity growth in
recent years. They stressed, however, that for the economy’s full potential to be realized,
decisive action will need to be taken over the coming years to re-establish a strong U.S. fiscal
position. In particular, they expressed concern that the worsening of the longer-term fiscal
position, including as a result of the recent tax cuts, will make it even more difficult to cope with
the aging of the baby-boom generation, and will eventually crowd out investment and erode
U.S. productivity growth.
Against this backdrop, Directors saw as priority for the U.S. authorities to manage carefully the
risks to the recovery, while establishing a credible approach for dealing with the longer-term
fiscal problem. They underscored that an effective response to these challenges will also help
ensure that the U.S. economy continues to play a key role in supporting sustainable global
growth, and avoid placing undue pressure on global saving and interest rates.
Directors commended the Federal Reserve for its strong and proactive response to the
economic slowdown. Most Directors saw scope for further easing if disinflationary pressures are
not arrested, and welcomed, in this regard, the authorities’ readiness to take further action if
needed, including by using a broader range of policy instruments. A number of Directors
considered that a quantified statement by the Federal Reserve of its medium-term inflation
objective could help anchor inflation expectations even more firmly and strengthen policy
transparency, especially in the present situation of very low interest rates and concerns about
possible, albeit remote, deflation risks. A few other Directors, however, observed that a more
specific statement of inflation objectives is unnecessary as a practical matter, given the clear
statement of intentions by Federal Reserve officials, and cautioned that a more specific
statement of an inflation objective might erode the authorities’ credibility in the absence of
instruments to achieve with precision a particular inflation target.

-4Directors considered the depreciation of the dollar during the past year to be consistent with
monetary easing and with the longer-term need to bring the U.S. current account deficit to a
more sustainable position. Some Directors noted, however, that the impact on the current
account could be relatively modest since the dollar had depreciated against the currencies of
only a limited set of U.S. trading partners. Directors underscored the importance of continuing to
ensure a cooperative approach toward the orderly adjustment of the U.S. current account
deficit. This would need to involve disciplined fiscal policies in the United States to help
strengthen national saving, as well as strong efforts among U.S. partner countries to promote
sustained growth.
Directors considered that the authorities face significant challenges in ensuring the long-term
sustainability of the fiscal position. Although the deficit-to-GDP ratio is projected to narrow in
coming years, the projections assume a substantial improvement in tax receipts and strict limits
on discretionary outlays, both of which would mark a sharp turnaround from recent
developments. The risks to the fiscal outlook appear especially worrisome given the significant
actuarial deficit arising from the longer-term demographic pressures on the Social Security and
Medicare systems.
Against this background, Directors again urged the authorities to establish a credible fiscal
framework, with the clear objective of returning the budget to balance, excluding Social
Security, over the next five to 10 years. By helping to reduce the debt ratio ahead of impending
demographic pressures, this framework would provide room to phase in the reforms that are
needed to place retirement and health care systems on a sound financial footing. To help
ensure the sizable fiscal adjustment over the medium term, Directors stressed the need to
contain spending growth, and they welcomed the authorities’ intentions in this regard. They also
underscored the importance of carefully reviewing tax priorities, given the considerable
uncertainty surrounding the future revenue outlook and path of tax rates. In this context, some
Directors specifically recommended measures to increase the tax effort to support the fiscal
adjustment. A few Directors encouraged the authorities to consider energy-related taxes, which,
in addition to helping to align energy supply and demand and curb emissions, could contribute
to strengthening the fiscal position.
Directors welcomed the assessment of the fiscal transparency Reports on Observance of
Standards and Codes that the United States sets high-level or best practice standards in most
areas of fiscal transparency. However, in some respects—in particular, the extensive use of
sunset clauses on tax cuts and the omission of some significant costs from recent budget
projections—most Directors noted that fiscal transparency appears to have weakened in recent
years. Directors welcomed recent plans to strengthen expenditure discipline and encouraged
the authorities to consider further steps toward new fiscal responsibility legislation that would
replace and strengthen the Budget Enforcement Act. Moves in this direction would serve to
catalyze and sustain political support for the needed fiscal adjustment by providing a suitable
framework for disciplining policies, and placing tax and expenditure decisions in the appropriate
medium-term context.
Directors urged the authorities to take early steps to strengthen the financial position of the
Social Security and Medicare systems. Relatively modest changes, if taken in a timely fashion,
could be sufficient to close projected shortfalls in the Social Security system. However, the
financial position of the Medicare system is particularly difficult. In light of this, some Directors
emphasized that any measures to enrich benefits should be placed in the context of a broad

-5strategy to deal with the system’s longer-term financial problems. A number of Directors also
stressed the need to consider the difficult financial situation of the state and local budgets.
Directors welcomed the resilience of the U.S. banking system in the face of the economic
slowdown, and noted that banks’ balance sheets appear to have held up well. Vigilance will,
nevertheless, be needed to ensure that banks are well-positioned to absorb the effects of an
eventual turnaround in interest rates or a possible cooling of real estate markets. Although
Directors noted that the government-sponsored enterprises do not appear to pose a systemic
risk, they urged the authorities to continue to monitor closely their risk management and
accounting practices, and to ensure that their disclosure was adequate. A number of Directors
saw merit in steps that would further limit these agencies’ special status. Some Directors
reiterated their encouragement to the United States to undertake a Financial Sector
Assessment Program. Directors welcomed the authorities’ intensified efforts to combat money
laundering and the financing of terrorism, and looked forward to early full compliance with
Financial Action Task Force recommendations.
Directors welcomed the considerable progress that has been made toward strengthening the
oversight of accounting and corporate governance during the past year. The priority now is to
ensure that the responsible agencies are provided with sufficient resources and support to
complete the reform agenda, in particular on improving accounting standards, ensuring the
independence of corporate boards, and harmonizing U.S. and international accounting
standards. Many Directors expressed concern about the significant underfunding of definedbenefit corporate pension plans that has emerged in recent years. They called for a
strengthening of the accounting, transparency, and funding of these plans. In the latter case,
some Directors particularly pointed to the merit of relaxing tax penalties against contributions to
fully funded plans. Some Directors also underscored the importance of carefully reviewing
options for strengthening the finances of the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation.
Directors called upon the United States to continue to play a leadership role in promoting an
open multilateral trade system. They acknowledged that the U.S. authorities have already made
useful proposals for moving the Doha Round forward, and looked forward to further concerted
efforts to find common ground with partner countries. Going forward, it will also be important to
continue to ensure that U.S. efforts to promote bilateral and regional free-trade agreements are
complementary to the multilateral approach to liberalization, and designed in a manner that
limits trade diversion and administrative complexities. Some Directors also encouraged the
authorities to take early action to comply with recent World Trade Organization rulings.
Directors welcomed the U.S. authorities’ commitment to boost development assistance, and
looked forward to further increases from its still very low level in relation to GNP. Many Directors
also saw scope for improving the complementarities between development and trade policies,
including by reducing U.S. agricultural subsidies further and lowering non-tariff barriers to
imports from developing countries.
