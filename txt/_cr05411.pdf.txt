PEOPLE’S REPUBLIC OF CHINA
Staff Report for the 2005 Article IV Consultation
Prepared by the Staff Representatives for
the 2005 Consultation with the People’s Republic of China
Approved by David Burton and Carlos Muñiz
July 8, 2005
•

The 2005 Article IV discussions with China were held in Beijing, Shanghai, and Shenyang
during May 11–25, 2005.

•

The staff team comprised Mr. Dunaway (Head), Messrs. Aziz, Aitken, Feyzioğlu, and Wang
(all APD), Ms. Fedelino (FAD), Mr. Bannister (ICM), Ms. Li (PDR), and Mr. Podpiera
(MFD). The team was assisted by Mr. Brooks (Senior Resident Representative) and
Mr. Barnett (Resident Representative). Mr. Xiaoyi Wang, Mr. Huarong Ge, and
Mr.Wufu Zheng (OED) participated in the discussions. Mr. Kato joined the mission on
May 23-24.

•

China has accepted the obligations of Article VIII, Sections 2, 3, and 4 of the Articles of
Agreement. Exchange controls continue to apply to most financial account transactions.

•

While progress continues to be made in upgrading China’s economic statistics, weaknesses
remain in key areas. These include the national accounts, fiscal and labor statistics, the
balance of payments, and the international investment position. The authorities are making
improvements in all of these areas. China has participated in the GDDS, with its metadata
posted on the official website (Dissemination Standards Bulletin Board) since April 2002.

•

At the time of circulation, the Chinese authorities have not indicated whether they consent to
the publication of the paper.

•

The last Article IV consultation was concluded on July 28, 2004. At that time, Executive
Directors noted that despite moderation in investment, a soft landing of the economy was not
yet assured. They cautioned against a premature relaxation of monetary policy and stressed
the need for fiscal policy to play a supportive role in achieving a soft landing. Directors
reiterated that greater exchange rate flexibility was in China's best interest and noted that the
initial move toward this objective was best made from a position of strength. They
emphasized that continued structural reforms would be crucial for China to sustain strong
growth over the medium term. Since the Article IV consultation, China has concentrated its
efforts on reining in credit and investment growth, conducting monetary and fiscal policies
broadly in line with the Board’s recommendations.

-3EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
Economic Setting:
Economic activity remained strong in 2004 and the first four months of 2005. GDP growth
stood at 9.5 percent in 2004 and 9.4 percent in Q1 2005, but its composition shifted as investment
growth moderated somewhat and the contribution from net exports increased. Inflation declined,
running at 1.8 percent in May, largely due to a reversal of food price increases. The external
current account surplus rose to 4¼ percent of GDP in 2004, and the trade balance strengthened
further in the first five months of 2005. This, together with strong capital inflows, has led to a
further large increase in foreign official reserves, which amounted to nearly $700 billion at endMay.
During the course of 2004, the authorities tightened macroeconomic policies. The People’s
Bank of China (PBC) took several steps to tighten monetary conditions and slow lending growth.
These measures have helped to slow the growth of broad monetary aggregates, but considerable
liquidity remains in the banking system. The government also tightened administrative controls
directed toward curbing investment growth in certain sectors. Strong revenue overperformance
helped to bring down the fiscal deficit by 1 percentage point to 1½ percent of GDP.
Policy Discussions:
With the substantial liquidity in the banking system, the staff advised that open market
operations should be intensified. The authorities also need to be prepared to tighten monetary
conditions further using market-based instruments if investment and lending growth appears to be
rebounding. The authorities agree about the need for containing investment growth, but consider
administrative measures to be still needed for this purpose.
Greater exchange rate flexibility continues to be in China’s best interest, and an early move
would be desirable. It would give China more control over its monetary policy, and increase the
economy’s resilience to external and domestic shocks. Conditions at present are favorable for
making an initial move, with further delay entailing additional costs to China’s economy, which
will grow over time. While agreeing with the need for more flexibility, the authorities are still
considering the appropriate timing for making a first step in this direction.
The likely outturn for the 2005 budget is generally appropriate and in line with the
objective of steadily bringing down the fiscal deficit over the medium term. Revenues should
overperform once again this year, and any overperformance that accrues to the central
government should be saved. The authorities regard the staff’s revenue estimate to be optimistic,
but are confident that at least the budgeted deficit target will be met.

On the structural reform agenda, bank reform should focus on strengthening the balance
sheets of the state banks and improving their internal control systems, governance, and credit
risk management. Reform of the state-owned enterprises, further development of financial
markets, and improvements in economic statistics need to be carried forward.

-4I. ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS AND OUTLOOK
A. Background

existing NPLs, much of which was created in the early 1990s. While a series of tightening
measures have helped to slow the pace of investment growth, it remains high, and substantial
liquidity remains in the banking system
2.
Since mid-2004, China’s external position has strengthened further with
continued strong reserve accumulation. This has been perceived as pointing to increasing
currency undervaluation and has focused international attention on China’s contribution to
global imbalances. Against this background, a sharp increase in textile exports to industrial
countries after the expiration of MFA quotas at end-December 2004 has sparked increased
protectionist pressures in some trading partner countries.
B. Recent Developments
3.
At 9½ percent, GDP growth in 2004 was broadly the same as in 2003, but its
composition shifted modestly away from investment in the course of the year (Table 1).
Investment growth moderated somewhat in response to stricter enforcement of administrative
controls and tightening of monetary conditions directed at restraining its pace. Net exports
increased its contribution to output growth, while consumption remained strong. Private
consumption grew by nearly 8 percent, a faster pace than in 2003, supported to a large extent
by rising rural income. Despite lay-offs of nearly 1½ million, due to the continued
restructuring of state-owned enterprises, the urban unemployment rate edged down by
0.1 percentage point to 4.2 percent in 2004, as job creation remained strong.

-5-

4.
Economic activity has maintained its momentum in the first five months of 2005.
GDP in the first quarter grew at 9.4 percent rate (year-on-year), with the contribution from
net exports increasing, as export growth remained strong and import growth moderated. Real
fixed asset investment grew by around 23 percent, similar to the average level in 2004. Retail
sales growth remained robust, suggesting continued strong consumer demand.

Despite continued strong output
growth, inflation has come down. After
peaking at 5¼ percent (year-on-year) in
Q3 2004, headline CPI inflation fell
sharply in late 2004, largely due to a
reversal of food price increases as
agricultural production rose. Supply-side
factors—such as increased capacity from
strong investment, persistent productivity
gains, and reduction in tariffs—also
served to kept non-food prices rises in
check. Headline inflation remained

-6relatively subdued during the first five months of 2005, running at 1¾ percent (y/y) in May.
After rising rapidly in the first part of 2004, PPI inflation has declined in recent months,
reflecting some easing in world commodity prices and raw materials demand in China.
6.
The external current account surplus rose by 1 percentage point to 4¼ percent
of GDP in 2004. On the trade front, export growth remained strong throughout the year, but
import growth slowed, particularly imports of raw materials and machinery and equipment,
due to the moderation in investment growth and an increase in the supply of some domestic
import substitutes. As a result, the trade surplus rose by 0.4 percentage point of GDP
(Table 2). Private transfers also rose, probably reflecting speculative inflows in anticipation
of a renminbi appreciation.
7.
China’s trade balance strengthened further in the first five months of 2005. In
particular, the trade balance during January-May shifted to a sizeable surplus in contrast to
the deficit registered in the same period of 2004. Exports during this period rose by
33 percent (y/y) while imports increased by only 13¾ percent, mainly reflecting continued
weak demand for raw materials and machinery and equipment. Chinese customs data suggest
that total textiles exports grew at roughly the same rate as in 2004 (at an annual rate of
around 20 percent), but importing country data indicate that the United States and the
European Union registered a surge in textiles from China. The United States has imposed
safeguards against textile imports from China, while the European Union has come to an
agreement with the Chinese authorities to limit the growth of textile exports.1 National
income accounts data suggest that the increase in the external current account surplus
reflected rising domestic savings that exceeded investment. China’s already high overall
savings rate rose further to around 49 percent of GDP in 2004 fueled by strong corporate
profits, with the contribution of retained earnings rising to close to half of the total. In
contrast, household savings, although still high, are estimated to have declined relative to
GDP in the last few years.2

1

Textiles account for about 14 percent of Chinese exports. In the first four months of 2005,
textile exports from China to the United States (based on importing country data) jumped by
53 percent and to the EU by 71 percent. In response, the U.S. Department of Commerce
re-imposed quotas on 7 categories of textile imports from China in May. In reaction, China
revoked export taxes on about half of the textile items subject to this tax, which was
originally introduced January 1, 2005. On June 10, the EU and China agreed to limit export
growth of ten categories of textile exports from China to 8-12½ percent per year up to
end-2007. Members of the U.S. Senate have proposed imposing a 27½ percent import tariff
on Chinese imports if the renminbi is not revalued by early October 2005.
2

This decline is unlikely to be caused by the increase in corporate savings, as only a small
part of the total enterprise equity is traded publicly in the stock market, and these shares are
not widely held by individuals, directly or through institutional investors.

The larger external current account surplus, together with strong capital
inflows, led to a further sizable increase in foreign official reserves (Tables 3 and 4).
International reserves increased by $206 billion in 2004 and by a further $81 billion in the
first five months of 2005, bringing the level at end-May to nearly $700 billion.3 While FDI
inflows (mainly from Hong Kong SAR, Korea, and Japan) remained strong, a substantial
portion of the reserve accumulation was accounted for by net non-FDI capital inflows
(including errors and omissions) largely attracted by the prospects of a renminbi
appreciation. The renminbi has depreciated in both real and nominal effective terms since
mid-2004, and by end-April 2005, it was about 18 percent below its previous peak in
February 2002.
9.
Real estate prices have continued to rise, with particularly large increases in
certain areas of fast-growing cities such as Shanghai. Some of the rise in housing prices is
due to the cumulative impact of liberalization steps in land markets undertaken since 1998,
but anecdotal evidence suggests that speculators are also quite active in the market.
3

In late-April, $15 billion of international reserves were used for the capital injection into
the Industrial and Commercial bank of China (ICBC), reducing the end-April reserve level
by that amount.

-8Concerned with speculative pressures, the People’s Bank of China (PBC) raised mortgage
interest rates in March 2005. In May, the authorities also announced a new set of propertyrelated measures aimed at curbing speculation in residential and commercial markets.4
Despite the rise in real estate values, affordability indices have generally improved as
household incomes have outpaced price increases.

10.
During the course of 2004, the PBC took several steps to reduce liquidity in the
banking sector and slow lending growth. The steps taken included intensifying open
market operations, raising the reserve requirement ratio and short-term re-lending and
rediscount rates, increasing bank deposit and lending interest rates (for the first time in
9 years), and eliminating the ceiling on lending rates. These were supplemented with credit
allocation guidance provided by the PBC and the China Bank Regulatory Commission
(CBRC) to influence banks’ lending decisions. These measures helped reduce broad money
growth to 14 percent and loan growth to 12½ percent by April 2005, down by about 5½ and
8½ percentage points, respectively, from their growth rates in 2003 (Table 5).

4

Some key elements of these measures are: (i) residential flats sold within two years of the
initial purchase will be subject to a sales tax; (ii) developers who do not develop land within
a year of purchase will face a tax penalty; (iii) land still idle after two years will be reclaimed
by the government; (iv) resale of unfinished flats will be banned; and (v) commercial banks
are required to tighten controls on lending to the property sector.

Nevertheless, considerable liquidity remains in the system at present, as
evidenced by a still high excess reserve ratio and low interbank interest rates. In
March 2005, the PBC cut the interest rate it pays on excess reserves held at the central bank,
adding to downward pressures on interbank rates and reducing interest rates on central bank
bills. The build-up in official reserves also continues to add substantially to liquidity. While
the PBC stepped up its open market operations to sterilize most of the inflows beginning in
late 2004, for the year as a whole only about half of the liquidity arising from the increase in
international reserves was sterilized (as the trade surplus and capital inflows remained high).
Overall, despite the liquidity in the banking system and some loosening of administrative
controls,5 credit growth remains relatively constrained owing to continued lending guidance
to banks provided by the PBC and the CBRC and restrained lending by the large state-owned
banks (SCBs) that are undergoing restructuring.

A key administrative measure, a six-month moratorium on converting agricultural land for
property development, expired in October 2004. The authorities replaced this with other
measures regulating land use, including encouraging land use rights auctions and tightening
environmental protection standards.

- 10 12.
Strong revenue overperformance allowed for a further decline in the fiscal
deficit in 2004. The deficit fell to 1½ percent of GDP (official definition; 1¾ percent
according to the IMF definition; Tables 6 and 7), about one percentage point of GDP below
its targeted level in the 2004 budget and the 2003 outcome. Once again, revenue was
substantially above its budget projection by 1¾ percentage points of GDP, reflecting strong
activity and continued improvements in tax administration. About half of this revenue
overperformance was used to finance increases in social expenditures and subsidies and to
clear up old government liabilities, including arrears on VAT refunds to exporters.6 The
remainder was unspent, partly because some transfers to local governments were made late
in the year. During the first four months of 2005, gross revenue (excluding VAT refunds)
grew by about 21 percent relative to the same period last year, compared with a budget
forecast for 2005 of an 11 percent rise, while expenditure growth was broadly in line with the
budget.
C. Macroeconomic Outlook and Risks
13.
Staff projects GDP growth to slow slightly during the year and to average
around 9 percent in 2005. This forecast assumes that appropriate macroeconomic policies
will be in place to further slow investment growth. Export growth will remain strong, but
slow from its current pace, with the growth in textile exports depending on the extent of
safeguard measures imposed by China’s trading partners. Import growth should pick up in
the remainder of the year—with orders that were temporarily put on hold in anticipation of a
currency appreciation brought on stream as inventories are depleted—but will remain below
its 2004 level, reflecting slower investment growth. Consumption growth is expected to
remain relatively strong as household credit facilities continue to expand and rural incomes
rise further, reflecting cuts in rural taxes and government efforts to stabilize domestic grain
prices. The external current account surplus would increase by nearly 2 percentage points to
6 percent of GDP, mainly reflecting a higher trade surplus. Inflation should average around
3 percent in 2005. Slower food price increases are likely to be only partially offset by a rise
in non-food prices as some of last year’s rapid producer price increases is passed through to
consumer prices and certain administered prices are raised.7
14.
A significant risk remains that macroeconomic policies will not be sufficiently
tight to curb investment growth. In particular, there is a need for monetary policy to
prevent a surge in credit growth as large capital inflows add liquidity to the banking system,
increasing the odds of tipping off a boom-bust cycle and igniting inflationary pressures.
Given the continuing volatility in world oil markets, a further sharp increase in oil prices
would adversely affect growth both directly and indirectly if this leads to a more pronounced
slowdown in global demand. Growing protectionist sentiments in China’s major markets,

Prices of utilities and other public services are slated to rise this year, after increases were

- 11 presents another key risk. Moreover, a disorderly unwinding of global imbalances would
threaten China’s growth, as economic activity in all countries would likely suffer lingering
adverse effects.
15.
China’s medium-term prospects are generally favorable provided near-term
risks are well managed and further structural reforms are implemented. The illustrative
medium-term scenario presented in Table 8 suggests that GDP growth could average
7-8 percent annually, if structural reforms are advanced in the financial sector to improve
intermediation of savings and in the state-owned enterprises and the labor market to maintain
strong productivity growth. Fiscal reforms could also contribute to promote a more effective
use of China’s high domestic savings. Better financial intermediation and reforms to China’s
pension and health care systems would help to raise private consumption by further
improving credit facilities and reducing the need for large precautionary savings. However,
unless enterprise profits fall sharply or SOEs pay substantially more dividends to their
shareholders (particularly the government), corporate retained earnings would remain high.
Modest fiscal consolidation over the medium term, which is needed to ensure sustainability
of public finances, will add to overall savings. With investment growth projected to decline,
which is desirable and intended by current government policies, China’s current account
surplus would not be expected to narrow substantially in the medium term in the absence of a
change in the real exchange rate. In particular, real appreciation would help raise
consumption as households’ purchasing power strengthened and renminbi prices of foreign
goods declined. However, following convention, the real exchange rate is assumed to remain
unchanged in the illustrative scenario presented here. In general, the extent of any change in
the real exchange rate, the form that it might take (the relative contribution of changes in
China’s inflation rate versus changes in its nominal exchange rate), and the consequent
impact on China’s external balance are uncertain, depending to a large degree on the
structural reforms that would be adopted in the medium term.
16.
Medium-term prospects are subject to significant risks. Growth could be
threatened in the years to come if China were to continue to rely heavily on investment as a
primary source, especially if inefficient investment in some sectors leads to overcapacity and
falling prices and profitability—as is already evident in the automobile industry, for
example—burdening banks with additional NPLs in the coming years (Box 1). If reform of
the domestic financial sector is not advanced substantially, vulnerabilities will continue to
increase as China further integrates into the global economy, and capital account
liberalization would expose the economy to potentially large swings in the direction of
capital flows as household and corporations diversify their portfolios. If the expected change
in the real exchange rate occurs through nominal exchange rate adjustment, inflation would
remain modest. In the absence of adjustment in the nominal exchange rate, not only would
the real exchange rate adjustment eventually take place through possibly much higher
inflation, the economy would also need to unwind the likely large build-up of imbalances in
resource allocation. Together these could have serious adverse effect on output. A rise in
social stresses within China (if, for example, income gaps between the rural and urban areas
increase substantially further) could also present a significant risk over the medium term.

- 12 Box 1. Changing Sources of Growth
Investment in China has soared since the mid-1990s, while GDP growth—although still relatively high—
has moderated from its pace in the late 1980s and early 1990s. At that time, investment was a lower share
of GDP, so that productivity and employment growth contributed more to economic activity.

A simple growth accounting exercise reveals a significant shift over time in the factors driving China’s
GDP growth away from total factor productivity (TFP) and employment growth to capital
accumulation. As the charts illustrate, investment took over in the late 1990s and early 2000s as a dominant
driver of growth. Over

Overall, the rise in
capital-intensive production and the low contribution of employment to growth in recent years is striking,
given China’s large number of underemployed workers. At the same time, the sustained fall in the marginal
productivity of capital suggests that the efficiency of investment is increasingly declining.

A standard growth accounting framework is used for this analysis. Aggregate output is assumed to be
α 1−α
produced using a Cobb-Douglas production function: Y = AK N , where Y is aggregate output, A is total
factor productivity, K is the capital stock, and N is total hours worked. Aggregate output is measured by GDP.
The capital stock is constructed using a perpetual inventory method, assuming an initial (1965) stock and a
physical depreciation rate of 0.06 that is based on the structure of fixed asset investment and industry surveys
of depreciation costs. N is approximated by the total number of employed workers. The elasticity of capital, α,
is set at 0.36, as is standard in the literature. A is derived as a residual. While the relative contributions to GDP
growth of the three principal factors affecting production may change somewhat with small changes in feasible
ranges in assumptions for key parameters, the basic trends in the data over time remain the same.

II. POLICY DISCUSSIONS
17.
The authorities agreed with the general economic outlook presented by the staff.
They noted that inflation remained moderate and economic measures already taken had
slowed investment growth significantly from its peak in the first half of 2004, and they
pointed to the risk that excess liquidity in the banking system and strong local government
incentives to invest could lead to a rebound in investment and bank lending growth. On the
external front, the authorities recognized the risks of a more pronounced slowdown in global
demand, and they were especially concerned by a rise in protectionist pressures in some
major trading partners. Against this background, the discussions focused on: further steps
that may need to be taken to constrain investment growth and keep inflationary pressures in
check; the likelihood that speculative inflows will continue to complicate monetary policy;
the need for an early move toward greater exchange rate flexibility; the scope for further
budget consolidation given an expectation of continued strong revenue overperformance; and
the structural reform agenda, including in particular financial market reform to substantially
improve the intermediation of China’s large domestic savings.
A. Monetary Policy
18.
The authorities recognize the need to contain investment and credit growth.
Monetary and credit aggregates have grown roughly in line with their annual targets, but the
restrained growth of the monetary aggregates—despite the abundant liquidity held by
banks—appears largely due to administrative measures and more cautious lending by the
state-owned banks undergoing restructuring. The staff cautioned that the substantial liquidity
in the banking system carried with it a risk of triggering a rebound in lending growth, and
thus, it suggested that the PBC should intensify open market operations to drain more of this
liquidity.
19.
Beyond more intense open market operations, the authorities need to be
prepared to tighten monetary policy further. If investment and lending growth appeared
to be rebounding, the staff recommended that stepped-up open market operations be
supplemented with increases in interest rates and reserve requirements. Staff also argued that
monetary tightening measures could be complemented, if needed, by further strengthening of
prudential rules relating to bank asset quality, such as guidance on bank lending standards,
provisioning requirements, and concentration limits. In addition to enhancing overall
financial stability, these steps would help curb near-term credit growth. The authorities
acknowledged that further policy tightening might be needed if investment and credit growth
were to rebound. While they favored making use of market-based monetary policy
instruments, the authorities pointed out that administrative measures would still be needed, as
these were better suited to restrain growth in the specific sectors where overinvestment was a
particular concern. Staff agreed that some administrative measures might be needed, but
favored measures that would enhance supervision of bank lending to vulnerable sectors.

- 14 -

20.
The staff discussed ways to improve the effectiveness of indirect monetary policy
instruments to manage the economy better. The effectiveness of monetary instruments
depends on the timeliness of policy actions. Accordingly, the staff urged the authorities to
consider granting the PBC more discretion to independently set interest rates. While
recognizing that interest rate changes are a national concern and that consultations within the
government could be beneficial in building support for a change, staff cautioned that policy
action could be unduly delayed. Moreover, reliance on administrative means of control,
while necessary at present, will have to diminish as the increasing sophistication of the
economy reduces their effectiveness and raises the cost of the distortions that they create. As
a transitional arrangement, staff suggested that consideration be given to granting the PBC
the authority to set benchmark interest rates at least within a specified range.
B. Exchange Rate Regime
21.
The staff reiterated the arguments for greater exchange rate flexibility in China,
emphasizing that an early move is warranted. Staff noted that greater flexibility is in
China’s best interest, as it would help in strengthening macroeconomic control by increasing
the scope for pursuing an independent monetary policy and the ability of the economy to
adjust to shocks. A phased approach in moving to full flexibility was recommended to limit
disruption to the domestic economy, especially since currency risk management instruments
are underdeveloped. While recognizing that the authorities are best positioned to decide on
the precise timing of a change, the staff stressed that conditions at present were favorable for
making an initial move, given that the economy is currently quite strong and that there are no
major impediments in foreign exchange and financial markets to doing so. The economic
costs of maintaining the current regime have been evident over the past year, and continue to
mount, suggesting an early move is warranted. Although it is difficult to reach firm
conclusions about its extent, the continued strengthening of the external balance points to
increased undervaluation of the renminbi, adding to the urgency of making a move.
22.
Further delay in moving toward greater exchange rate flexibility would entail
additional costs to China’s economy. The staff pointed out that under the current fixed
exchange rate, adjustment in China’s economy to growing external surpluses was taking
place, but in ways that may be creating serious distortions and potential vulnerabilities for
the economy. In particular, delay in making a change in the exchange rate regime would
likely continue to create visible problems in the form of a further large build-up in reserves
and growing difficulties in sterilizing capital inflows. This situation also runs the risk that the
PBC’s ability to conduct monetary policy could be compromised, particularly if concerns
about the impact on the central bank’s income position constrained decisions on interest rate
increases. Less visible would be a likely build-up of short-term foreign currency liabilities, as
Chinese firms find it increasingly attractive over time to borrow funds offshore, substantially
raising the economy’s external vulnerability. Investment decisions across the economy
would also continue to be distorted, with resources allocated to projects in the traded goods
sector than may not be viable over the medium term. Consequentially, the economic costs of
delaying a move might be growing faster than is currently evident. The staff also raised
concerns about rising protectionist pressures and the growing possibility of a disorderly

- 15 -

resolution of global external imbalances, which would have lingering adverse effects on all
countries.
23.
The authorities broadly shared the staff’s views on the advantages of increased
exchange rate flexibility over the medium term, but noted that a consensus on the
timing of a move had not yet been reached.8 They underscored that significant progress
has been made in preparing for a move to greater exchange rate flexibility. The authorities,
however, stressed that their key concern continues to be the potential adverse impact of a
change in the exchange rate on macroeconomic and financial sector stability. Some officials
also felt that China should not move on the exchange rate until the banking system was
reformed. In addition, the authorities considered the current regime and the level of the
exchange rate to have served regional and global economies well, and that there was no
convincing evidence pointing to the undervaluation of the renminbi—a view supported by
some international analysts. Concerns were also expressed that growth and employment—
particularly in the agricultural sector—could falter if a large and unwarranted appreciation
follows the exchange rate regime change, with potentially serious implications for social
stability. At the same time, the authorities stated that a resolution to the problem of global
imbalances required a concerted effort by all major countries, led first by credible action in
the United States to reduce its fiscal deficit and increase national savings. While
acknowledging that China had a role to play, they stressed that China alone could not solve
this problem. They noted that growing protectionism against Chinese exports and stepped-up
international pressures for an exchange rate change have complicated the decision-making
process.
24.
Responding to the authorities’ concerns about the impact on China’s economy,
the staff argued that the effects on growth and employment of an initial change in the
exchange rate were likely to be moderate. The impact would vary across sectors of the
economy and across regions, but the overall impact of an initial move would not be large,9
and could be managed—especially in an economy that has considerable underlying strength
in activity—with some easing of macroeconomic policies or other policy adjustments. In this
regard, if rural income were a particular area of concern, the staff noted that it would be
better to address any difficulties caused by an exchange rate change—which were likely to
be limited—through fiscal transfers to affected households than by delaying a move in the
rate. In the commercial banking sector, the direct effects of a likely exchange rate change
should be small, with exposure to foreign currency risk relatively low. Indirect effects
8

Subsequent to the consultation discussions, Premier Wen Jiabao in a public speech on June
26, 2005 stressed that, the authorities' objective was to “gradually establish a market-based
and well-managed floating exchange rate system.” To meet this objective, steps would be
taken based on “the principles of independent initiative, controllability, and gradual progress
to independently determine the modality, content, and timing of the reform in accordance
with China's needs for reform and development.”
9

The staff’s analysis is presented in the Selected Issues paper.

- 16 -

through the impact on bank customers also should not be significant. The net impact on the
corporate sector would likely be positive, as the value of foreign currency debt would decline
and balance sheets would improve, although customers in the export sector may suffer
somewhat. Staff also noted that greater exchange rate flexibility has preceded capital account
liberalization in many advanced and developing countries, and that, in fact, experience
suggests that it is advantageous to have increased exchange rate flexibility for a period of
time prior to the liberalization of capital flows to allow the exchange market and hedging
instruments to more fully develop.
25.
The staff agreed with the authorities that dealing with global imbalances
required a concerted effort on the part of all countries to take policy actions that were
in each country’s own interest. Staff acknowledged that on its own China’s direct
contribution to reducing the global imbalances would not be large, as suggested by the staff’s
analysis of the impact of a change in the renminbi’s value, but stressed that it is the combined
effect of adjustment in all countries that would make a major difference. This is why the
Fund was calling for decisive policy actions by all major countries, including meaningful
fiscal consolidation in the United States and structural reforms in Europe and Japan, to help
deal with the problem. The staff also noted that greater renminbi flexibility should facilitate
further flexibility in the exchange rates in some other currencies in Asia, thereby indirectly
contributing to the orderly adjustment of global imbalances.
26.
Staff and the authorities agreed that greater flexibility, not simply a revaluation,
remains a key objective in any change in the exchange rate regime. While there are
substantial pressures for appreciation in the near term and expected developments in the
economy point to real exchange appreciation over the medium run, its extent is uncertain and
the exchange rate may be subject to considerable short-term volatility. For example,
continued increases in China’s relative labor productivity and improved access to foreign
markets would exert upward pressures, while the further opening of China’s domestic market
and the eventual liberalization of the capital account would generate depreciation pressures.
How these factors play out over short time horizons is unclear. Increased flexibility would
greatly facilitate the economy’s ability to adjust to these pressures. In addition, increased
flexibility would help to deepen spot and futures foreign exchange markets, which will not
develop meaningfully until there is a perceived risk of two-way movements in the exchange
rate. In terms of the monetary policy framework, the PBC would have greater policy
independence, and accordingly, there would be a need for a new nominal anchor. Money and
credit targeting for at least a while could continue to be used to set policy. Over time, China
should consider moving toward inflation targeting for setting monetary policy, as adopted by
many countries following moves to more flexible exchange rate regimes. In China, it will
take some time before inflation targeting can be fully operationalized, given the lack of
adequate and timely short-term indicators of demand and the need for institutional changes.

- 17 -

27.
The mission discussed with the authorities various options in choosing the initial
step to introducing flexibility. Staff argued that this step should be significant enough to
improve monetary policy independence and help curb speculative capital inflows by
convincing market participants that no further changes were likely very soon. At the same
time, there was a desire to avoid undue volatility in the exchange rate, particularly in the
early stages of increasing flexibility when options for hedging are underdeveloped. To
achieve these objectives, the authorities could widen the trading band around the U.S.
dollar—at its present or at a revalued rate—or linked to a basket of currencies. The choice of
approach involved trade-offs. A large widening of the band introduces greater flexibility, but
it could entail the risk of potentially greater volatility. A smaller widening of the band
combined with a revaluation and/or a shift to a basket link could result in less volatility, but
it would only yield a limited increase in flexibility. Alternatively, a step revaluation alone, if
large enough, could help to slow speculative inflows, but would not provide any flexibility.
C. Fiscal Policy
28.
The likely outturn for the 2005 budget is broadly appropriate and in line with
the objective of steadily bringing down the fiscal deficit over the medium term. This
year’s target for the nominal deficit was lowered from its level in the 2004 budget, despite
including one-off payments for tax arrears. Based on the staff’s growth forecast, the budget
deficit in 2005 amounts to roughly 2 percent of GDP (official definition). Revenue is
conservatively projected to increase by 11 percent, and expenditure is budgeted to rise by
14 percent. Part of the expenditure increase (and the rise in the budget deficit, relative to
GDP, compared to last year’s outturn) reflects a further and final clearance of outstanding
VAT arrears (amounting to roughly 1 percentage point of GDP) and includes local
government spending of the unspent revenues from 2004. The staff welcomed the shift, albeit
relatively gradual, in the composition of spending in the 2005 budget away more from
investment toward social spending, and encouraged the authorities to consider further
reallocation in this direction to help constrain investment growth while increasing much
needed spending on health and education.
29.
Given relatively conservative official estimates, the staff expected that the
revenue outturn for 2005 could once again exceed the budget projection by a
substantial amount (Tables 6 and 7). The staff urged the authorities to save any
overperformance on revenues that accrues to the central government, and by so doing,
provide in effect an “automatic stabilizer” to help restrain domestic demand.10 The
authorities regarded the staff’s estimate of revenue as overly optimistic, highlighting in
particular the risk that restraints on China’s exports by trading partners could reduce budget
revenue and give rise to increased social spending to compensate adversely affected
households. Nevertheless, they were confident that at a minimum the budget targets would be
met.
10

A Selected Issue paper explores the effectiveness of fiscal policy as a tool for
macroeconomic management.

- 18 -

30.
Over the medium term, continued fiscal consolidation will be needed to meet
likely large demands on public funds without jeopardizing debt sustainability. While
explicit debt is relatively small (around 23½ percent of GDP at end-2004) this substantially
underestimates the likely extent of overall government liabilities. Contingent liabilities are
large, arising from such sources as NPLs of state-owned banks built up largely as a result of
lending to SOEs, “unrecorded” debt at the local level, and unfunded pension obligations.11
Their ultimate impact on the fiscal position will depend on how these liabilities are resolved,
and comprehensive estimates of such fiscal costs are difficult to make at this juncture. The
costs of SOE closures and social obligations transferred from SOEs to the government will
add to these liabilities, as could rising health care costs as the population ages. In light of the
government’s likely large liabilities, the staff suggested that it would be appropriate to
continue to reduce the fiscal deficit by at least ¼ to ½ percent of GDP per year over the next
few years, which was roughly consistent with the authorities’ target of a constant nominal
deficit. The staff also encouraged the authorities to make additional downward adjustments
in their nominal deficit target when favorable conditions permit, as was the case in 2005. In
particular, with another possible overperformance of revenue relative to budget and all
outstanding arrears on VAT refunds to be settled in 2005, there would be scope for a further
significant reduction in the nominal deficit target in the 2006 budget. The authorities
responded that they would continue to follow a prudent fiscal policy in the medium term, and
the deficit would be consolidated depending on the evolution of the economy.
31.
Fiscal consolidation should be accompanied by strengthening the structure of
the public finances.12 In this regard, the staff urged further progress in a number of areas
including shifting from a production- to a consumption-based VAT (now being successfully
piloted in the North-East), adding services to the VAT tax net, and unifying the income tax
rate for domestic and foreign-funded enterprises. Central and local fiscal relations are in need
of reform, as income disparities across regions continue to widen, with some provinces
facing difficulties funding some expenditure mandates. In this reform, consideration also
needs to be given to the impact of population migration on local government finances.
Structural imbalances in subnational finances need to be addressed, including by assessing
the possibility of reforming tax assignments across levels of government, clarifying
expenditure responsibilities, and reforming the transfer system to move toward a more rulebased equalization system. The staff also called for adequate transfers to local governments
to fund existing pension and other social security liabilities.
32.
Strengthening fiscal management, including through better formulation and
execution of spending, would help to increase fiscal transparency and ensure that funds
are spent for their intended purpose. The key to this is reforming the budget process,
including by putting in place a revised budget classification system, better recording and
11

NPLs in the banking system are reported to be around 19½ percent of GDP as of end2004.

12

The Fund has provided extensive technical advice in this area (Annex I).

reporting of spending, and further progress in implementing the treasury single account.
There is also a need to strengthen revenue forecasting and cash management, to improve
coordination with monetary policy. The authorities indicated that the revised budget
classification system would be used to prepare the 2007 budget.
III. STRUCTURAL REFORMS
A. Banking and Capital Market Reforms
33.
The authorities have placed banking reform at the center of the overall agenda
to improve intermediation of China’s large private savings. Progress has been made in
strengthening supervision and in improving bank operations, especially in the three large
state-owned commercial banks, which have been recapitalized. (Box 2).13 Financial
restructuring of the Bank of China (BOC) and the China Construction Bank (CCB) has been
completed, and the banks are on track to meet the first full set of quantitative performance
benchmarks at end-2005, as specified in their restructuring plans. Preparations for IPOs have
advanced and the sale of a 9 percent stake in the CCB to Bank of America corporation was
announced in June 2005. In addition, the authorities have recently approved a restructuring
plan for the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China (ICBC), the largest commercial bank
in China, which involves significant public financial support and follows benchmarks similar
to those set for the BOC and CCB. While under present circumstances financing bank
recapitalization from central bank resources may be a pragmatic approach to speed up
reform, the staff stressed that the quasi-fiscal liabilities acquired by the PBC in this process
needed eventually to be transferred to the budget.
34.
The authorities and staff agreed that banks’ balance sheets needed to be further
strengthened, and internal control systems, governance, and credit risk management in
the state banks needed to be further improved. In addition, compliance with performance
benchmarks had to be closely monitored and enforced. While the authorities pointed to the
slowdown in lending by the three SCBs as an indication that their commercial orientation
had improved, the staff was less certain, noting that establishing a credit culture and
increasing the commercial orientation of these banks is a major undertaking, and it will
inevitably take time before improvements in lending decisions become broad based. The staff
acknowledged the progress made in reducing government involvement in management and
business operations of banks. However, more needs to be done, particularly with regard to
local governments, to remove this serious impediment to fully commercializing banks.

13

A Selected Issues paper discusses progress in banking sector reform.

- 20 -

Box 2. Progress in Banking Reform
Progress has been made in banking reforms, but considerable work remains to be done to improve the
efficiency of banking intermediation. The two reform pilot banks, the newly incorporated Bank of China Ltd.
(BOC) and China Construction Bank Corporation (CCB), have made steps to change their corporate governance
structure and adjust operations.1 As a result of recapitalization, sales of nonperforming loans (NPLs), and other
reform efforts, the banks’ capital strength, asset quality and operating results improved. In 2004, operating profits of
the BOC and CCB increased by approximately 15 percent, reported NPL ratios declined to 5 percent and
3.9 percent, respectively, and capital adequacy with full provisioning for NPLs exceeded the required minimum of
8 percent of risk-weighted assets. Both banks are on track to meeting the first full set of quantitative performance
benchmarks at end-2005. Preparations for IPOs have advanced and the sale of a 9 percent stake in the CCB to Bank
of America corporation was announced in June 2005. However, recent scandals—high-level corruption at the CCB
and embezzlement at the BOC—call into question the effectiveness of existing internal control and corporate
governance systems in the two banks. In April 2005, the government approved a reform plan for the Industrial and
Commercial Bank of China (ICBC), the largest commercial bank in China. By mid-2005, the government is to
provide financial support large enough to bring the ICBC’s capital adequacy (with full provisioning for NPLs) to
8 percent and the bank is planning to raise additional capital in the market. The ICBC will follow the same reform
process and performance benchmarks as the BOC and CCB.
Aggregate capital adequacy improved and
reported NPLs were reduced, but it remains to

to total loans, by 4½ percentage points to
13¼ percent and further to 12¾ percent at endMarch 2005. However, the decline of NPLs was mainly due to transfers of bad assets to the AMCs, recapitalization,
and write offs, and it remains unclear whether bank credit risk evaluation systems substantially improved. The
AMCs have been slow to resolve bad assets, disposing of only 55 percent of their original NPLs as of endMarch 2005 (taking into account debt-equity swaps, about 70 percent of the original NPLs have been disposed).
Foreign ownership of banks has increased, which has the potential to improve governance and accelerate the
transfer of technology and management practices. In 2004, the number of Chinese banks with foreign strategic
investors doubled and reached 10. The entry of HSBC into the Bank of Communications, the fifth largest bank, was
the most important transaction, and it may be viewed as a “pilot” for entry of strategic investors into the four stateowned banks. In banking supervision, regulations were issued or revised to strengthen credit authorization, risk
management, and capital adequacy. The CBRC took steps to strengthen on-site examinations, monitoring of large
exposures and connected lending.

The staff emphasized that particular attention should be given to activities of the
Agricultural Bank (ABC), which has neither been restructured nor recapitalized. Relatively
rapid expansion of the ABC’s lending may be creating new problems for itself and for other
banks through the impact of its competition in certain segments of the credit market. Given
this, the mission stressed the urgency of putting in place a restructuring plan, and the need to
monitor very closely the bank’s lending behavior. Although the authorities shared the staff’s
view that a restructuring plan for the ABC was imperative, they also pointed to the
significant challenges that could arise given the scale of the bank’s operations and the role it
plays in the agricultural sector.
36.
Along with the attention placed on the large state banks, reform efforts have also
focused on the smaller banking institutions. In particular, the authorities aim to make the
rural credit cooperatives (RCCs) more efficient vehicles of financial services to rural areas.
A pilot program, launched in 2003 to improve the operations of the RCCs and to strengthen
balance sheets through capital injections, was extended nationwide in 2004. Most aspects of
RCC reform are expected to be completed by end-2007. The staff welcomed this initiative as
potentially playing a significant role in helping to develop the rural sector. As in the case of
the SCBs, establishing and supervising carefully the implementation of time-bound plans for
improving the commercial orientation, risk management, internal controls, and governance
arrangements for these institutions is essential for this reform to be successful. In addition,
the availability of sufficient financing to properly recapitalize the RCCs is very important. In
this regard, staff expressed some concerns, particularly regarding the possible sources of
financing.
37.
The staff welcomed the progress made in improving bank supervision. The
CBRC has taken steps to strengthen on-site examinations and monitoring of large exposures
and connected lending. The critical task for the CBRC will be to see that all banks are taking
the necessary steps to ensure that they can comply with capital adequacy requirements with
full provisioning by 2007, as required by existing guidelines. The PBC and the CBRC have
been preparing an introduction of a deposit insurance scheme, which the staff cautioned
should be designed and implemented with great care, particularly given the existing
weaknesses in the banking sector. Staff also welcomed the PBC’s plan to publish its first
financial stability report this year.
38.
Progress has been made in reducing NPLs, but more efforts are needed to
accelerate the resolution of distressed assets and restrain the rate of new NPL creation.
Although the recorded rate of new NPL creation has slowed, staff cautioned that this could
be a misleading indicator of bank performance, as NPLs often surface only over time.
Indeed, with banks heavily involved in lending to sectors facing future overcapacity, such as
automobiles, steel, cement, and aluminum, credit risk in the banking sector is likely to
remain high. Staff urged that steps be taken to accelerate the slow rate of disposal by AMCs
of NPLs originally transferred to them from the banks. Staff also stressed that the adoption of
a new bankruptcy law that provides sufficient protection for creditors will be important for
addressing existing and future NPLs, and urged the authorities to ensure the law provides an
adequate market mechanism to facilitate liquidation. The legal framework for creditor rights

- 22 -

and foreclosure also needs to be improved, and bank and AMC incentives to resolve
distressed debt would be enhanced by allowing full tax deductibility for specific loan loss
provisions.
39.
The staff emphasized the benefits of participating in an FSAP, which would help
in formulating next steps in financial sector reform. The authorities indicated that a decision
has been made to participate in a FSAP. The authorities still need to decide on the
appropriate time to launch the process.
40.
The staff discussed steps needed to accelerate the development of China’s capital
markets. The limited role of capital markets in China at present reflects the dominance of
the state banks in intermediation, but these markets are also plagued with regulatory and
governance problems.14 Increasing the role of bond and equity markets would improve
intermediation, allow for more efficient pricing of credit risk, and strengthen management of
financial risk.
41.
Despite China’s strong economic growth, equity markets have performed
poorly. Only relatively small portions of state-owned enterprises have been floated, and
uncertainty regarding how the government will shed its holdings of nontraded shares
overhangs the market, depressing share prices. Aborted attempts to sell these shares in the
past have added to this uncertainty. To deal with the situation and begin the process of
converting state-owned shares to tradable shares in listed companies, a new pilot program
has been launched. This program provides for some compensation to existing shareholders
by providing them additional shares in exchange for their consent to the floating of the
remaining nontraded shares . The staff welcomed this approach to reducing the overhang and
reviving the equity market, but it cautioned that the authorities’ plan could give a small group
of existing shareholders too much leverage in approving the public sale of remaining
nontraded shares. This could lead to excess compensation and also slow the process of
disposing of state-owned shares. The authorities responded that their approach of conducting
these sales on a pilot basis would provide guidance for addressing the concerns raised by the
staff when the scheme is ultimately expanded. In addition, the authorities have taken steps to
clean up problems in a number of brokerage firms, and in the process, some limited measures
have been adopted to compensate investors for the default of these firms. The staff cautioned
against increased investor protection using public resources. The staff emphasized that the
authorities’ plans for a planned investor protection fund should carefully limit and define
precisely what protection it should provide to investors to avoid creating substantial moral
hazard.
42.
The staff discussed reforms to improve the functioning of the domestic bond
market. Several government agencies currently play regulatory roles in the bond market,
often with some overlap of responsibilities. As a result, the bond market is over-regulated,
14

Impediments to the development of local corporate bond markets are explored in a
Selected Issues paper.

- 23 -

with state control inhibiting development. Streamlining the regulatory process is a priority.
As a key first step, the current “merit-based” system requiring government selection of each
individual corporate bond issue needs to be replaced with a system based on requiring firms
to disclose operational and financial information, allowing the market to determine whether
these firms can raise capital. At the same time, the current cap on corporate bond interest
rates has to be removed to allow proper pricing. The authorities are considering changes
along the lines the staff was proposing, but emphasized that, given the past problems with
issuing bonds, a cautious approach would have to be followed. In addition, the staff
suggested that steps be taken to unify the bond market, which was segmented with
government bonds being traded on the interbank market and corporate bonds being listed on
the stock exchange. Recently, the authorities took an important step in this direction by
allowing some corporate bonds to trade on the interbank market.
B. Reform of the State-Owned Enterprises
43.
State-owned enterprises have become more market oriented, although further
reforms are needed. The state sector has shrunk over time (concentrating on key industries)
with progress in corporate and management restructuring and increased foreign ownership.
Many state enterprises are now profitable on a flow basis, as legacy debts and social
responsibilities have been taken off their balance sheets. The improved cash position has
resulted in higher enterprise profits, which have been largely reinvested rather than being
returned to shareholders, especially to the government.15 This has been a major contributor to
the rise in investment in recent years—with about half of total investment financed from
retained earnings in 2004 (Box 3)—and has made demand management difficult by
generating procyclical investment cycles.
44.
The staff encouraged the government to exercise stronger governance over
SOEs, in particular by strengthening the ownership role of the State Asset Supervision and
Administration Commission (SASAC) and requiring profitable enterprises to pay dividends
to the government. This will help improve public finances (for example, by using these
resources to partially fund existing pension and social liabilities), focus enterprises on
increasing their net worth, and help to stem the pace of investment. The staff also urged
further progress in SOE restructuring, including the closing of unviable SOEs (enterprises
that are not viable, but deemed to be socially important, should be supported directly through
the budget), and improvement in accounting and auditing practice.
C. Rural-Urban Income Disparity
45.
Rising urban-rural income disparity is a major concern of the authorities and
they are taking a number of steps to address it. Plans are in place to extend reductions in
local taxes on agricultural production—which were initiated in selected provinces in 2004—
15

High world commodity prices and monopoly positions in many sectors have also
contributed to higher SOE profits in recent years.

- 24 -

to more regions in 2005, with the aim of eliminating these taxes by 2006. Implementation of
the Rural Land Contracting Law also is important in strengthening the agricultural sector.
The law will improve the security of property rights and allow for the transfer and leasing of
land, which will enhance the ability for farming to be done on a more efficient scale. In
addition, the staff suggested that considerations should be given to allowing farmers to raise
funds by using their land for loan collateral. This, together with the reform, restructuring, and
recapitalization of the rural credit cooperatives, would expand the availability of rural
financing, which will open up new opportunities to improve agricultural production and raise
rural income over time. The authorities indicated that this issue would be addressed in the
context of amending other key relevant legislation. The staff also suggested that further
efforts to allow greater access to health and education for rural-urban migrants would also be
helpful in encouraging the rural workforce to seek new employment opportunities, while the
reorientation of government spending on basic services, such as health and education, at the
local government level would help to improve worker skills. However, staff cautioned that
unless appropriate accountability systems are put in place, any increase in spending might
not fully deliver the desired benefits.
D. Other Issues
46.
The authorities maintained that implementation of China’s WTO commitments
remains on track. The unweighted average tariff rate was reduced by another half
percentage point to 10 percent in 2005, and key commitments with respect to banking
services and trade and distribution rights have also moved forward. Except for a few
products, tariff reductions required under WTO commitments beginning in 2005 have all
taken effect, and quotas—except on agricultural products, which are in compliance with the
WTO agreement—have been removed. The authorities see regional and bilateral free trade
agreements as supplementary to multilateral agreements and are fully committed to further
multilateral trade liberalization. They expressed, however, strong disappointment in the
recent re-imposition of quotas by the United States and the EU on some textile products
following the liberalization of textiles trade beginning this year. China has provided debt
relief to low income countries under the enhanced HIPC Initiative.
47.
The staff welcomes the commitment of the authorities to curb money laundering
and combat the financing of terrorism (AML/CFT). Efforts are underway to put in place a
framework consistent with the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) standards. China has
recently become an observer to the FATF; however, there is work ahead in order to meet the
requirements of full FATF membership, including the enactment of a comprehensive
AML/CFT legislation.

Box 3. Who is Financing China’s Investment?
In the last 15 years, investment in China has been very strong, averaging 39 percent of GDP.
Two large cycles dominate this period. The first peaked in 1993, when the investment-to-GDP ratio
reached 43¼ percent. The second is ongoing, and the investment-to-GDP ratio is projected to remain
around 45 percent this year. Over the whole period, enterprises have invested on average about
30 percent of GDP, while households and government contributed 6 and 3 percent of GDP,
respectively.
Most of this investment has been funded from domestic sources. Gross national saving over this
period averaged 41 percent of GDP and is estimated to have reached 50 percent of GDP in 2004. Net
foreign savings have been negative throughout this period (except in 1993), but this masks the small
but increasing role of foreign direct investment in financing enterprise investment.
Close to half of total fixed asset investment
is financed from internal funds of
enterprises. Total internal funds used
annually for investment purposes amounted
to an average 15 percent of GDP, and
reached 23½ percent of GDP in 2004. One
key reason for this large reliance on internal
funds is that the majority of enterprises,
which are fully or partially state-owned, do
not distribute dividends to the state; instead,
the state allows them to use these funds for
investment. The shift toward more self-raised
funds as source of financing in 2003–04 may
also reflect tightening of monetary policy.

Banks also have been an important source of investment financing (in the table, bank financing
is categorized as domestic loans as well as “other” sources of funds, which include loans to
individuals). In the last six years, domestic bank financing of enterprise investment averaged around
15 percent of GDP (measured by the net change in total loans to enterprises); however, this figure
may overstate the extent of bank financing, as enterprise deposits have also grown strongly during
this period.
The government and external funds have played a smaller, but still significant, role in financing
investment in China. Government funding has been mostly in the form of transfers from the budget
(mostly for infrastructure), averaging around 6–7 percent of GDP. Foreign funding of enterprise
investment has been mostly limited to FDI, which has averaged around 4 percent of GDP in the last
six years (based on balance of payments figures). These inflows have mainly come from other Asian
economies (including Hong Kong SAR, Taiwan Province of China, Japan, and Korea), rather than
from the United States and Europe. External debt and non-FDI private capital inflows have increased
somewhat in the last three years, albeit from a very low base.

- 26 -

48.
The staff encouraged the authorities to continue to improve China’s economic
statistics. While China’s data are adequate for surveillance purposes, weaknesses remain in
key areas, including the national accounts, fiscal and labor statistics, and the balance of
payments and international investment position.16 The staff suggested that efforts be focused
in particular on publication of annual and quarterly real GDP on an expenditure basis;
improving labor statistics; providing data that would facilitate on-going monitoring of the
financial sector; measuring investment better, especially reforming the current practice of
including land sales in fixed investment; and addressing the lack of reliable data on the
change in business inventories.
IV. STAFF APPRAISAL
49.
China has continued to maintain a high rate of growth, while further
transforming the economy towards greater market orientation. Prospects for the future
remain favorable, but risks are significant and need to be well managed through appropriate
policy responses. Continued implementation of structural reforms in the financial sector, in
SOEs, the labor market, and public finances are needed over the medium term. However, to
establish a stable economic environment in which to implement further structural reform,
macroeconomic policies have to deal with a number of significant near-term risks. In
particular, policies need to ensure that the pace of investment and loan growth remains in
check. Large capital inflows continue to add to the considerable liquidity already in the
banking system, raising the risk that a resurgence in credit growth could tip off a sudden
boom, fuel inflationary pressures, and lead to a further build-up in banks’ NPLs. On the
external front, growing protectionist sentiment in China’s major markets could curb growth.
In addition, a disorderly unwinding of global imbalances would have serious adverse effects
on China’s economy, as activity in the rest of the world would be adversely affected.
50.
The authorities recognize the need to ensure that investment growth slows down
sufficiently in the remainder of 2005. To this end, steps should be taken now to drain more
of the existing liquidity out of the banking system through open market operations. If
investment and lending growth appear to be rebounding, open market operations would need
to be supplemented with increases in interest rates and reserve requirements. Such measures
could be complemented, if needed, by further significant strengthening of prudential rules
which would enhance overall financial stability and contribute to curbing near-term credit
growth.

(Dissemination Standards Bulletin Board) since April 2002.

51.
The effectiveness of monetary instruments depends on the timeliness of policy
actions. Accordingly, the PBC needs to be given more discretion to independently set
interest rates. While consultation within the government may be beneficial in building
support for an interest rate change, policy actions can be unduly delayed. Moreover, reliance
on administrative means of control will have to diminish over time, as the increasing
sophistication of the economy reduces their effectiveness and substantially raises the cost of
the distortions that they create. As a step toward improving monetary policy effectiveness,
consideration should be given to granting the PBC authority to set benchmark interest rates at
least within a specified range as a transitional arrangement.
52.
Greater exchange rate flexibility continues to be in China’s best interest, with an
early move desirable. It would help to strengthen macroeconomic control by increasing the
independence of monetary policy and the ability of the economy to adjust to shocks. Given
the desire to limit disruption to the domestic economy and with currency risk management
instruments underdeveloped, a phased approach to full flexibility would be appropriate.
While the authorities are best positioned to decide on the precise timing of an initial move, it
would be best to make such a move from a position of economic strength, and an early move
is warranted. This step would need to be significant enough to improve monetary policy
independence and help curb speculative capital inflows by convincing market participants
that no further immediate changes were likely. There are no impediments in the exchange
and financial markets that would prevent taking such a step, and the continued strengthening
of China’s external position has added to the urgency of making this move.
53.
The costs associated with a continued delay in moving toward greater exchange
rate flexibility are growing. Over the near to medium term, delay in changing the current
regime is likely to create continuing visible problems in the form of a further large build-up
in reserves and growing difficulties in trying to sterilize the impact of these inflows on
liquidity in the banking system. Less visible are the distortions in resource allocations that
are being created and the likely build-up of short-term foreign currency liabilities, as Chinese
firms would find it increasingly attractive over time to borrow funds offshore. The
effectiveness of capital controls will also diminish in time. In such an environment, a
negative shock to China’s external position could put significant stress on the financial
system. Although the costs of delay are not immediately apparent, they are present and
growing.
54.
In addition to serving China’s own interest, greater flexibility would play a role in
contributing to an orderly process for resolving global current account imbalances. A change
in China’s exchange rate regime on its own cannot be expected to have a major impact on
global imbalances. Decisive policy actions are also required by all major countries, including
a meaningful reduction in the United States’ fiscal deficit and structural reforms in Europe
and Japan. Greater renminbi flexibility would be expected to facilitate increased flexibility in
the exchange rates of some of the other Asian economies, which would also contribute to an
orderly global adjustment.

- 28 -

55.
The likely outturn of the 2005 budget is broadly appropriate. The shift in
expenditure from investment to social areas is welcome, but further reallocation in this
direction would help constrain investment growth while increasing much needed spending on
health and education. In the current environment, the revenue outturn could once again
significantly exceed the budget target. The authorities should save any overperformance on
revenues that accrues to the central government, thereby helping to restrain domestic
demand.
56.
Over the medium term, further fiscal consolidation will be needed to meet likely
large demands on public funds, including those associated with contingent liabilities,
without jeopardizing debt sustainability. The staff continues to recommend that reducing
the deficit by ¼ -½ percent of GDP per year should be the medium-term goal. Moreover, the
authorities should make additional downward adjustments in their nominal deficit target, as
undertaken this year, when similar favorable conditions permit. With another
overperformance of revenue relative to budget likely and all outstanding arrears on VAT
refunds to be settled in 2005, there would be scope for a further significant cut in the nominal
deficit target in the 2006 budget.
57.
Fiscal consolidation should be accompanied by strengthening the structure of
the public finances. In this regard, the staff urges further progress in shifting from a
production- to a consumption-based VAT, extending the VAT to cover services, and
unifying the income tax rate for domestic and foreign-funded enterprises. Structural
imbalances in subnational finances should be addressed, including by assessing the
possibility of reforming tax assignments across levels of government, clarifying expenditure
responsibilities, and reforming the transfer system to move toward a more rule-based
equalization system. The central government should also make adequate resources available
to local governments to fund existing pension and other social liabilities.
58.
Strengthening fiscal management would help to ensure that funds are spent for
their intended purpose. In particular, better formulation and execution of spending is
required. The key to this is reforming the budget process, including by putting in place a
revised budget classification system, better recording and reporting of spending, and further
progress in implementing the treasury single account.
59.
Improving intermediation of China’s large private savings is critical to
medium-term prospects for rapid and stable growth. Bank restructuring is a key element
in this reform. The authorities are making progress, especially in three of the four large
commercial banks, but much remains to be done. Particular attention needs to be given to the
activities of the ABC, where expansion of lending operations may be creating new problems
for the ABC itself and other banks. All of the state banks require strengthening their balance
sheets, and additional improvements in their commercial orientation, risk management,
internal controls, and governance. The banks have to learn to price risk appropriately, and
accordingly, they should make full use of the latitude given to them by last year’s
liberalization of lending rates, which was an important step taken by the PBC to help develop
the banking sector. The involvement of all levels of government in bank management and

- 29 -

business operations needs to be eliminated. Diversifying bank ownership, for example by
allowing qualified foreign financial institutions to take strategic stakes, also could bring
much needed technical expertise and better governance. Continued close monitoring of
progress in meeting the benchmarks set out in the restructuring plans for the three large stateowned commercial banks that have been recapitalized remains particularly important. So far,
the central bank has provided the bulk of the resources needed for the restructuring of the
banking system. While this reflects current circumstances and a pragmatic approach taken in
order to speed up the reform process, these quasi-fiscal liabilities need eventually to be
transferred to the budget.
60.
The CBRC continues to make progress in improving bank supervision. Further
strengthening of supervision will aid the bank reform process. It is essential to ensure that all
banks can achieve capital adequacy requirements with full provisioning by 2007, as required
by existing guidelines. The adoption of a new bankruptcy law that provides sufficient
protection to creditors will be important for resolving existing and future NPLs in an orderly
manner, and it is critical that the law allows for an adequate market mechanism to facilitate
liquidation. Incentives to resolve distressed debt would be enhanced by allowing full tax
deductibility for specific loan loss provisions.
61.
Increasing the role of bond and equity markets would also improve financial
intermediation. To reduce the overhang of existing nontraded shares in the equity markets,
the authorities have introduced a pilot program to allow them to be tradable. They have also
taken some limited measures to compensate investors for the default of brokerage firms.
However, care needs to be taken to ensure that public resources are not used to protect
investors, just as the authorities need to be careful in limiting and defining precisely what
protection it provides to investors to avoid creating moral hazard. In the bond market, a key
first step would be to eliminate the current system of government approval for firms to issue
corporate bonds, and replace it with a more market-oriented system based on disclosure of
operational and financial information for issuing firms. The cap on corporate bond interest
rates also needs to be removed to allow proper pricing of such bonds.
62.
China’s decision to participate in an FSAP is welcome. This could help in drawing
up a blueprint for further reform and development of the entire financial sector. It would be
useful to quickly reach agreement on the timing of the FSAP.
63.
Staff welcomes progress in making SOEs more market oriented, although
additional reforms are still needed. Some enterprises have been able to substantially
expand their operations in recent years by reinvesting the large profits they have enjoyed. To
ensure that these funds are well invested, a priority is for the government to exercise stronger
governance over these SOEs, including by strengthening SASAC’s ownership role and
requiring profitable SOEs to pay dividends to the government. This could help improve
public finances, focus enterprises more on increasing their net worth, and could significantly
help stem the pace of investment growth.

- 30 -

64.
Continued trade reform is important for China to expand its market access in
industrial countries and sustain its integration with the global economy. The IMF staff
welcomes the authorities’ intention to implement remaining WTO commitments as scheduled
and China’s ongoing support for the completion of the Doha Development Round.
65.
The IMF staff welcomes improvements in the quality of economic statistics,
although incomplete data in several areas still affects the monitoring of macroeconomic
developments. A continuing major priority for further improvement is the compilation and
timely publication of annual and quarterly real GDP data on an expenditure basis. Balance of
payments statistics are another area that needs attention, and the authorities are utilizing
Fund technical assistance to improve these data and ensure that the reporting of data on the
international investment position is done as soon as feasible. Other efforts should be focused
on improving labor statistics and providing data that would facilitate on-going monitoring of
the financial sector.
66.
It is proposed that the next Article IV consultation with China take place on the
standard 12-month cycle.

ANNEX I

CHINA—DEBT SUSTAINABILITY ANALYSIS
1.
An analysis of the sustainability of China’s government debt based on the standard
Fund framework does not suggest major difficulties over the next few years; however, over
the longer term, large quasi-fiscal liabilities and rising expenditure pressures are key sources
of potential fiscal vulnerability. The standard Fund framework cannot be easily extended to
longer horizons because data limitations preclude precise estimates of quasi-fiscal liabilities;
there are also considerable uncertainties in trying to gauge the magnitude of potential
expenditure pressures over the longer term.
2.
China’s official government debt is low, but would be significantly larger if
quasi-fiscal liabilities were included. Official data show that the stock of explicit
government debt stood at about 24 percent of GDP at end-2004.1 Contingent liabilities
include nonperforming loans (NPLs) in the banking system, unfunded pension obligations,
and external borrowings by state-owned enterprises (SOEs). Owing to lack of data, this debt
sustainability analysis only includes estimated losses from reported NPLs and the minimum
transition costs of shifting to a viable pension system.2 However, potential data weaknesses
and inevitable problems in implementing new prudential regimes suggest that the scale of
problem loans may be higher. Transition costs of the pension reform could also be
substantially higher, depending on the magnitude of changes to the pension parameters.
Liabilities, direct and contingent, of local governments are not included, as no information is
available. On the other hand, China could potentially use its substantial stock of state assets
to finance government debt obligations. Moreover, potential pressures on spending are
expected to intensify over time, especially due to an ageing population; however, their fiscal
impact would mainly fall outside of the medium-term horizon covered here.

1

This estimated stock includes regular issues of bonds to finance the central government’s
budget deficits, as well as the bonds issued to recapitalize the four state-owned commercial
banks in 1998 and bonds used for on-lending to local governments.
2

Based on authorities’ data, the stock of NPLs is estimated to amount to about 30 percent of
GDP at end-2004 (also including the stock of NPLs originally transferred to AMCs,
amounting to about 10 percent of 2004 GDP). In the DSA exercise shown in Table I.1, it is
assumed that NPLs have a recovery rate of about 20 percent; for the projections of future
NPLs, it is assumed that 16 percent of new loans will eventually become nonperforming.
Unfunded pension liabilities are assumed to be about 7 percent of GDP and covered by the
budget in 2006; interest will also be paid on these and the bonds issued to cover NPLs as of
2007.

- 40 -

ANNEX I

3.
The debt sustainability analysis is based on the staff’s macroeconomic
projections and on the authorities’ medium-term fiscal framework. Key assumptions
include:
•

GDP growth is projected to gradually decelerate and stabilize at 7 percent a year from
2009.

•

The nominal value of the deficit will be held constant at its projected 2005 level,
implying a decline in the primary deficit of about ¼ percent of GDP a year.

•

The average domestic real interest rate increases gradually to 3 percent within five
years, reflecting gradual liberalization of the financial sector.3

4.
Under these assumptions, the debt-to-GDP ratio would have a step increase in
2006 (to about 52 percent of GDP), but then would resume a declining path over the
projection period (Table I.1). The sensitivity analysis suggests that fiscal sustainability may
not be a major concern over the next few years, provided that structural reforms continue to
be implemented. To take into account the uncertainties about the future macroeconomic
conditions, spending needs, and the actual level of contingent liabilities, the effects of a
higher real interest rate, lower growth, wider primary deficit, and a higher stock of
contingent liabilities were simulated. Isolated or combined temporary adverse shocks on
these key variables would only increase the debt-to-GDP ratio in the short run.
•

Individual temporary shocks. A temporarily lower GDP growth rate would increase the
debt-to-GDP ratio to about 54 percent in 2006 (scenario A3), and a higher real interest
rate would increase the ratio to above 58 percent in 2007 (scenario B1), but these ratios
would then resume a declining path as in the baseline scenario.4

3

Given the existing interest rates and maturity structure of public debt, the projected return
of modest inflation produces a decline in the aggregate effective real interest rate during the
projection period.
4

The standard deviations and means for all variables have been calculated on the basis of the
last 10 years.

- 41 -

ANNEX I

•

Combined temporary shocks. Should GDP growth be slower, the real interest rate higher,
and public spending more expansionary all at the same time (by one standard deviation),
the debt-to-GDP ratio would increase to about 60 percent in 2007 and then decline
(scenario B4).

•

Higher initial public debt stock. If debt-creating flows were to be 10 percentage points of
GDP higher in 2006, the debt-to-GDP ratio would reach 63 percent in 2006, but would
fall to below 58 percent of GDP by 2010 (scenario B5).

ANNEX II

CHINA’S FISCAL REFORMS AND TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE
In recent years, technical assistance has focused on statistical development, banking
supervision, economic training, and a comprehensive fiscal program. The attached table lists
recent technical assistance missions to China. This annex focuses on the main staff
recommendations in the fiscal area and summarizes recent fiscal reforms.
Fiscal Technical Assistance Program
FAD has largely provided advice on tax policy, tax administration, and budget and treasury
reforms in the context of joint UNDP/IMF program (2000-04) recently concluded. The
UNDP’s final evaluation of the project provided a positive assessment of the Fund’s role.
A successor project (2005-08) on capacity building to support pro-poor fiscal reform in
China was recently signed. The role of the Fund under the new program has been discussed
but not yet agreed upon; in the meantime, there is scope for providing TA in a few priority
areas, as explained below.
Tax policy
The scope of the Fund TA work in this area has been quite comprehensive, covering every
major tax: the value-added tax (VAT), the business tax, the enterprise income tax (EIT), and
the personal income tax (PIT). Some of the TA has also targeted the tax treatment of specific
sectors, including the financial sector.
The VAT is currently the most important tax in China from a revenue standpoint. However,
it has two unique features: (1) it is a production-type VAT, i.e., credits are not given for the
VAT on capital goods; and (2) it excludes most services, which are taxed under a separate
business tax. The focus of the Fund’s TA advice on the VAT has been on transforming it into
a consumption-type VAT (which is now being piloted in three North-East provinces), and
bringing the service sector into the VAT net. As there are important revenue and centralprovince intergovernmental implications of the VAT reform, the Fund has paid particular
attention to alternative transition strategies.
With respect to income tax, the Fund’s TA advice has focused on improving the structure of
the enterprise income tax (EIT), including the unification of the regimes applying separately
to domestic and foreign enterprises, and rationalizing and reducing the scope of EIT
incentives. Steps are underway for EIT unification, to be implemented in 2007. For the
personal income tax (PIT), while the present revenue yield is still relatively insignificant, it is
important for its distributive implications and revenue consequences over time. Its structure
should be streamlined and its rates simplified. The PIT income exemption threshold should
also be increased in conjunction with the rate restructuring.

- 44 -

ANNEX II

The liberalization of the financial sector under the WTO commitments has important tax
implications, in particular as the financial sector opens up to foreign competition. The Fund’s
TA advice has covered topics of taxing banks, insurance companies, investment and pension
funds, derivatives, and security transactions, allowing tax deductibility of specific loan
provisions, and shifting business tax from a gross interest base to a net interest base.
The authorities also intend to streamline and reduce the tax burden on farmers. In this regard,
the 2005 budget announced the elimination of the agricultural by 2006, ahead of the original
schedule. This reform will have implications for local governments, which collect this tax.
Reflecting priorities in this area, the Fund will be initially involved in the extension of VAT
to financial services.1
Tax administration
The authorities have been putting in place the basic building blocks of a modern national tax
administration. In this regard, the Fund TA program has aimed at assisting the State
Administration of Taxation (SAT) to develop the strategic capacity required for it to manage
a national tax system, with assistance provided to both the central and provincial
governments. Information technology development has been satisfactorily completed and
risk management techniques have been introduced to SAT and to its provincial managers.
The SAT currently operates under an organizational structure based around tax type. This has
been found almost universally to be an inefficient way to organize resources, as it leads to
duplication of efforts, costly and complex computerization, poor communications, taxpayer
service inefficiencies and difficulties in developing technical specialization. The clear trend
has been to move away from tax-type structures toward the development of organizations
based around common administrative functions, or around taxpayer types in a few cases.
The SAT should adopt a nationally consistent organizational structure. As an initial step,
Fund TA would advice on an appropriate structure, its implications and needed changes.
There is also a need to strengthen other aspects of SAT operational effectiveness, for
example by improving compliance management and developing self-assessment practices.
Public expenditure management
In order to improve the efficiency of public spending, a number of budget and treasury
reforms are being implemented. In the budget area, the budget coverage is being expanded to
include extra-budgetary revenue and spending, the budget preparation cycle has been brought
forward and extended, and departmental budgets are being implemented. On the treasury

1

Other related areas where technical assistance could be provided, including on revenue
forecasting, are covered below.

- 45 -

ANNEX II

reform side, a treasury single account (TSA) has been broadly established at the central level
and is being rolled out to the provincial level.2 Some progress has also been made on macrofiscal policy coordination.
These efforts have been supported by Fund’s extensive technical assistance, covering
diagnostic missions on budget execution (including on the development of a treasury within
the MOF and a TSA), budget preparation, macro-fiscal policy coordination, and budget
classification and the underlying accounting framework.
The authorities have also announced their intention to reform the Budget Law, in line with
recent Fund TA. Areas of improvements include the clarification of the roles and rights of
the legislative and executive in the budget process; restriction on the use of extrabudgetary
funds; improvements in the sequencing and timetable for budget preparation; stronger
medium-term focus of the budget; and the joint consideration of current and capital budgets.
Work is, however, still needed in the treasury and accounting area, where there are three
main concerns. First, while there are valid arguments for using the pilot testing approach
favored by the authorities for rolling out a computerized General Financial Management
Information System (GFMIS), these pilots should best be developed after the decision is
taken on the underlying process reforms and the appropriate IT strategy. Otherwise, there is a
risk that communication (and particularly data transfer) between different parts of the system
will be compromised. Second, insufficient progress has been made on the chart of accounts,
which represents a key requirement for the GFMIS conceptual design. Finally, and more
generally, treasury reforms have advanced faster than those in the budget area. For this
reason, it is crucial that the adoption of budget classification system in line with international
standards—currently on hold—be resumed expeditiously, as this is a key prerequisite for
developing an appropriate reporting system.
More recently, the authorities have identified a need to improve macro-fiscal forecasting
(both on the revenue and expenditure side) and cash management. The Fund stands ready to
assist in both areas.
Intergovernmental fiscal relations
In recent years, the authorities have become increasingly aware of the need to reform the
system of intergovernmental fiscal relations, as imbalances between the center and
subnational levels are growing and regional disparities are widening. There is a need to
clarify expenditure mandates, including by centralizing some spending responsibilities such
as pensions. Revenue sharing and the design of the transfer system also need to be looked at.

2

A standard Treasury Single Account (TSA) is a bank account or a set of linked bank
accounts through which the government, including its entities and spending units, transacts
all receipts and payments, and consolidates its cash balances. Cash balances held by a
government are efficiently centralized through a TSA.

- 46 -

ANNEX II

Key considerations should include giving more control over tax rates to local governments,
while transfers should be tailored to the delivery of minimum standards of public services.
The Fund stands ready to provide TA on the reform of revenue sharing.
There is also growing concern about the fiscal risks building up at the local government
level. Local governments, faced with a legal prohibition to borrow, resort to creative
financing to fund their expenditures. In line with Fund TA recommendations, at a minimum a
fiscal risk register should be established in the treasury to keep track of these liabilities. The
possible relaxation of the legal constraints on local government borrowing will need to be
preceded by a number of structural reforms, including strengthening the recording and
reporting of local government operations and enhancing the accountability and transparency
of local government financial management.

VII. Exchange Arrangements:
1.
China’s exchange rate arrangements were most recently notified to the IMF in 1994,
when they authorities introduced a unified exchange rate system. In their formal notification
the authorities described the new exchange rate system as a unified, market-based, and
managed floating regime. Under this regime, the exchange rate of the renminbi is determined
in the interbank foreign exchange market. The State Administration of Foreign Exchange
(SAFE) of the People’s Bank of China (PBC) announces a basic rate for the renminbi against
the Hong Kong dollar, the U.S. dollar, the euro, and the yen, based on the weighted average

- 50 -

ANNEX III

exchange rate that prevailed in foreign exchange transactions on the previous day. In the
interbank foreign exchange market, daily changes in the value of the renminbi against the
U.S. dollar are limited to 0.3 percent on either side of the basic rate, as announced by the
PBC. The daily movement of the renminbi against the Hong Kong dollar and the yen is
limited to 1 percent on either side of the basic rate (daily movements beyond this limit must
be reported). On February 28, 2005, the exchange rate was Y 8.28 per U.S. dollar.
2.
China accepted the obligations of Article VIII, Sections 2, 3, and 4 of the Fund’s
Articles of Agreement on December 1, 1996. There are repatriation and surrender
requirements on proceeds from exports and from invisible transactions and current transfers.
All enterprises authorized to conduct current account transactions may retain foreign
exchange equivalent to 50 percent of their current account foreign exchange earnings in the
previous year (effective May 1, 2004, up from 20 percent), except for special purpose
transactions, such as donations and international postal remittances, for which the ceiling is
100 percent. They must sell the rest of their foreign exchange earnings to authorized banks.
Importers must provide valid proof and commercial bills to obtain foreign exchange. In 1998,
new requirements expanded the scope of documentation required for most forms of current
transactions and required prior verification of the underlying transactions in some instances
(e.g., the customs service must certify the value of imports before banks can provide foreign
exchange for payment). There are no measures currently in force that have been determined
to be exchange restrictions subject to Fund jurisdiction.
3.
Exchange controls continue to apply to many capital transactions. In general, capital
account transactions require the approval of government departments who are in charge of
foreign exchange flows (including NDRC, MOC, CSRC, and SAFE), however there has been
some relaxation of controls in recent years. Effective December 1, 2002, qualified foreign
institutional investors (QFIIs) are allowed to invest domestically in A shares, subject to the
following restrictions: (i) QFIIs must have minimum experience in the industry (5 years for
fund managers; 30 years for insurance companies) and at least US$10 billion in assets under
management in the latest financial year, and be cleared of any major irregularities in their
home market over the past three years; (ii) a QFII that is a bank must be among the top
100 international banks by assets in the latest financial year; (iii) a QFII that is an insurance
or a securities company must have a minimum paid-up capital of US$1 billion; and (iv) for
each QFII, ownership of any Chinese company listed on the Shanghai or Shenzhen stock
exchange is limited to 10 percent, and the total shares owned by QFIIs in a single Chinese
company cannot exceed 20 percent. QFIIs must set up a special renminbi account with
domestic banks and use the services of domestic securities companies. Close-ended QFIIs
can only remit capital after three years, in installments of no more than 20 percent of the total
each time, and at intervals of one month or more. Other QFIIs can only remit capital after
one year, in installments of no more than 20 percent of the total, and at intervals of three
months or more. Regarding portfolio investment abroad, foreign exchange funds of insurance
companies were allowed to invest in overseas securities markets. This policy has been put
into effect and investments have taken place. In addition, as of December 1, 2002,
nonresidents are allowed to purchase B shares, which are denominated in U.S. dollars or
Hong Kong dollars, using new or existing foreign currency deposits. In 2004, development
international financial institutions were approved to raise funds domestically in renminbi for

- 51 -

ANNEX III

domestic use only, while other nonresidents are still not permitted to issue capital or money
market securities in the domestic market. The transfer of personal assets abroad by Chinese
citizens emigrating overseas or by nonresidents receiving inheritances is also now permitted.
Purchases of capital and money market instruments abroad by residents are restricted to
banks who can do foreign exchange business and some approved multinational companies. In
2001, measures were introduced to ease restrictions on the purchase of foreign exchange with
RMB for the advance repayment of foreign debts, foreign exchange on-lending and domestic
foreign exchange loans. Prior approval from the SAFE is needed for licensed commercial
banks to convert foreign exchange into yuan for capital investment purposes, except in some
provinces where it was eliminated under a 2001 pilot program. Also, since December 2001,
FFEs no longer need SAFE approval to convert foreign currency into yuan for capital
investments, and commercial banks are now responsible for verifying the related documents.
4.
An annual foreign borrowing plan sets mandatory ceilings for all borrowing by
government departments and enterprises (except FFEs which are subject to individual limits
negotiated in the investment approval process). The National Development and Reform
Commission determines the medium- and long-term external debt quotas, while the SAFE is
responsible for short-term external debt quotas. Financial institutions can do business
without approval in advance under the quotas, but regular reporting to SAFE of external
debts are obligatory. The pre-approval investigation for other institutions covers the financial
situation of the enterprise, the need for the loan, and whether the terms of the loan are
consistent with the use of the proceeds. For short-term borrowing by financial institutions
(less than a year), the amount of borrowing is subject to an overall limit determined by the
SAFE on an annual basis (there are also enterprise-specific limits); financial institutions can
conduct business within this limit without explicit approval, but must register the borrowing
with the SAFE.
5.
Regulations on guarantees by residents to nonresidents have the following key
features. First, guarantees consist of collateral and pledges in addition to what are commonly
known as assurances. Second, prior SAFE approval is required for financing guarantees
provided by banks and all guarantees provided by other institutions (with the exception of
solely foreign funded enterprises). Prior approval is not required for nonfinancing guarantees
provided by banks. Third, both domestic and foreign-currency-denominated guarantees are
covered by the regulations. Fourth, the approval process for guarantees is based on
prospective guarantors’ profits, assets to liabilities, and foreign exchange revenues, etc.
6.
China maintains controls on FDI, although it has generally pursued an “open door”
policy toward inward FDI. In the case of overseas direct investment, foreign exchange is
provided after a SAFE review of sources of foreign exchange funds and an assessment of the
investment risk involved, approval by the Ministry of Commerce (MOC), and registration
with SAFE. From May, 2005, a pilot program of the reform of overseas investment foreign
exchange regulation was expanded country-wide, and the annual quota of total foreign
exchange for overseas investment of each province or municipality was increased to
$5 billion. In the case of inward direct investment, nonresidents can invest in China subject
to meeting certain regulations and MOC approval. On April 1, 2002, a new four-tier
classification system for foreign investment was introduced, defining activities where foreign

- 52 -

ANNEX III

investment is encouraged, permitted, restricted or banned. In effect, this resulted in the
opening up of many industries previously closed to foreign investment, particularly in the
services sectors, consistent with China’s WTO-related commitments.
7.
Domestic financial institutions and firms cannot engage in such derivative
transactions for purposes of speculation. However, transactions designed to hedge interest
rate or exchange rate risk are possible. All transactions involving derivative instruments
under foreign debt items must be registered with SAFE. With respect to the development of a
forward foreign exchange market for the renminbi, all banks have been permitted to offer
forward transactions involving the renminbi, but the market remains small and proof of an
underlying current transaction is required for access to forward cover.

ANNEX IV

CHINA: STATISTICAL ISSUES
1.
While China’s economic statistics are adequate for surveillance purposes, weakness
remain in key areas. China has made significant strides in bringing its economic and
financial statistics into line with international good practice. In April 2002, China began
participation in the Fund’s GDDS and its metadata were posted on the Fund’s DSBB (the
most comprehensive documentation of Chinese economic and financial statistics available in
English). The most recent metadata updates were received from the authorities in April 2005.
While China’s economic statistics are adequate for surveillance purposes, weaknesses remain
in the quality of the data, including coverage, frequency and timeliness. The main statistical
issues are noted below.
Real sector
2.
Data on the expenditure components of GDP are not available on a quarterly basis.
Annual GDP by expenditure is compiled at current and constant 2000 prices, but the constant
price estimates are not published. Quarterly data are produced in cumulative form, with
minimal revisions of previous data, making it difficult to assess quarterly developments
accurately or to make seasonal adjustments. Constant price measures of GDP are also suspect
because of deficiencies with the price indices and techniques used to derive the estimates.
Nevertheless, the National Bureau of Statistics has made a number of improvements to the
range and quality of national accounts data, including quarterly estimates of GDP by industry
and estimates of GDP by type of expenditure. Further improvements are intended, including
the adoption of the 1993 System of National Accounts, further development of income and
expenditure data, and improvements to quarterly GDP estimates. However, no target dates
have been set. As in other countries, rapid economic change, including the expansion of the
nonstate sector, presents new problems for data compilation. The ability to change the
collection of data is restricted by the decentralized nature of the statistical system. Extensive
technical assistance has been provided from multilateral and bilateral institutions.
3.
Monthly industrial production, retail sales, and fixed investment data also have a
shifting base that does not permit the production of a consistent time series. Data revisions
tend to be made without publishing the entire revised series. Retail sales and fixed
investment data are published only in nominal, not real, terms.
4.
Labor market statistics—including employment and wage data—are not
comprehensive, and are only available on an annual basis, with considerable lag.
5.
Prior to December 2000, the consumer price index was not produced in a time series
format, as there were only comparisons between the current month and the previous month,
and the current month with the same month of the previous year. For most items, the weights
were for the previous year’s expenditures with the other weights being updated each month.
Technical assistance missions in September 1991, April 1995, and June 1997 dealt with the
concepts and methodology of internationally used index formulae. The authorities have
received technical assistance and training on price index methodology under a cooperative

- 54 -

ANNEX IV

program with Statistics Canada. A technical assistance mission in August 1999 reviewed the
methodology to compile fixed-base price indices in test projects in four provinces and found
that only in one province the index was adequate. In January 2001, the NBS began to publish
an annually-chained Laspeyres price index, which more accurately reflects consumer
spending patterns (e.g., the weight of services increased, while the weight of food declined).
The number of survey items has been expanded to more than 550 from the previous 325. The
weights of the major CPI components were provided to the staff during the 2001 Article IV
mission.
Government finance
6.
Serious data shortcomings continue to hamper fiscal analysis. Budgetary data exclude
spending associated with domestic bond proceeds on-lent to local governments and official
external borrowing. Also, data on the social and extra budgetary funds are only provided
annually and with a long lag. Expenditure classification remains very poor, mainly because
data are not classified by economic type. However, the situation should improve with the
introduction of a revised budget classification system, starting with the 2007 budget.
7.
China has not reported central government and local government budget data for
publication in the GFS Yearbook since 2001. No data are provided on government debt or the
operations of extrabudgetary funds. The revenue classification does not fully distinguish
between revenue and grants, tax and nontax revenue, and current and capital revenue. The
presentation of expenditure is by function only and does not comply with international best
practice. Following a government finance statistics technical assistance mission earlier this
year, the authorities recently—and for the first time—submitted data on general government
for 2002 and 2003 for publication in the 2005 edition of the GFS Yearbook.
Monetary accounts
8.
In recent years, improvements have been made in the classification of accounts of the
monetary authorities and banking institutions. From 2002, compilation and reporting of
monetary data include foreign-currency-denominated accounts of residents and accounts of
the branches of foreign banks.
9.
The monetary and banking surveys lack sufficient detail with regard to bank claims
on the government, hampering the estimation of the fiscal deficit from the financing side.
A recent development is that the PBC has ceased to report separate data on central
government deposits in its balance sheet beginning with data of April 2005 because the MOF
no longer distinguishes between central and other government deposit accounts. In addition,
detailed breakdowns of bank credit extended by industry, and by borrower (including by the
various elements of the state and nonstate sectors), are not publicly available. The staff
continues to encourage the authorities to report information of this nature for analytical
purposes.

- 55 -

ANNEX IV

10.
Due to the restructuring of the banking sector, new statistical issues have arisen, such
as how to record the transfer of non-performing loans to asset management companies, and
how to classify these companies in the banking survey. The monetary and financial statistics
mission that visited Beijing in early 2005 made recommendations for addressing these issues.
11.
The reported net foreign assets position of PBC does not include exchange rate
valuation effects nor interest earnings on foreign reserves.
Balance of payments
12.
The State Administration of Foreign Exchange (SAFE) relies on an International
Transactions Reporting System” (ITRS) which produces data derived from information on
foreign exchange transactions conducted by banks. To supplement the ITRS, SAFE conducts
periodic sample surveys to collect data on travel and trade credits, while additional data are
collected from reports on balance sheet information from financial institutions and data on
portfolio investment and direct investment.
13.
The data are compiled (in U.S. dollars) largely in accordance with the fifth edition of
the Balance of Payments Manual (BPM5). Semi-annual (January-June) data are compiled
and disseminated within four to five months after the end of the reference period while data
on an annual basis are disseminated within six months of the end of the reference period. It
appears that the authorities may be close to being able to publish quarterly estimates of the
balance of payments. Within the current account, component detail is available on goods,
services, income, and transfers. Data on the financial account are also available with
significant component detail for functional categories, but with limited sectoral breakdown.
14.
The Fund has provided extensive technical assistance for China to improve balance of
payments and IIP statistics. In August 2002 a seminar was held on Balance of Payments and
IIP statistics in Chengdu, China. The coverage of direct investment transactions remains a
problematic issue in the Chinese balance of payments and IIP statistics. Data on these
transactions, received mainly from the Ministry of Commerce (formerly Ministry of Foreign
Trade and Cooperation), apparently do not cover all required elements such as
disinvestments, while the direct investment survey developed by SAFE has not provided
reliable data. Another issue that has to be addressed by the authorities is to extend
verification and auditing programs to reduce measurement errors and ensure the long-term
performance of the ITRS. For this purpose regular training programs for staff in the
provincial offices of SAFE were recommended. In addition, in January 2003 a legislative
guarantee for the improvement of the quality of ITRS reporting entitled “The Checking
System on Balance of Payments Reporting Data (experimental)” was promulgated by the
SAFE.

- 56 -

ANNEX IV

15.
The authorities reported that they have been compiling international investment
position (IIP) statements for five years (1999-2003) on a trial basis and they are in the
process of soliciting comments from experts, including the IMF. Some data categories still
need to be improved; therefore, no IIP data have been published so far.
16.
The Fund has also provided technical assistance on the coverage, timeliness, and
periodicity of China’s data on official reserves, reserves-related liabilities, as well as on other
external assets and liabilities, financial derivative activities, and other contingent and
potential liabilities. In the December 2003 GDDS progress review, the authorities indicated
that they had completed the preparatory work for completing the template on international
reserves and foreign currency liquidity in accordance with the SDDS and that there were no
technical problems remaining. The authorities also noted that the definition and coverage of
China’s external debt data follow closely the recently-published External Debt Statistics:
Guide for Compilers and Users. Such data are compiled monthly but published on a
quarterly basis (monthly data have not been provided to Fund staff on a regular basis).
Despite an ostensibly modest level of external vulnerability, there remains a need to
strengthen external debt monitoring and compilation, while introducing additional
transparency in data dissemination. STA will conduct a seminar on external debt statistics in
August 2005 as part of the China Training Program for 2005.
17.
In April 2004, STA conducted a seminar in Xianyang, Xi An China on the
Coordinated Portfolio Investment Survey (CPIS) to explain the concepts and practical issues
involved in undertaking the survey. There was active participation in the seminar although no
commitment was made at that time to participate in the CPIS.
18.
STA held a workshop and a high-level seminar on the use of macroeconomic
statistics for policy analysis and decision making in China in January 2005. A STA technical
assistance mission on IIP statistics visited Shanghai during April 2005. The tasks of the
mission were to conduct a two-day seminar focusing on the importance and usefulness of the
IIP and to meet with compilers to provide detailed technical advice on specific issues related
to China’s IIP.
Data reporting to STA for publications
19.
In June 1999, the PBC resumed reporting monthly monetary data and has agreed to
their publication in IFS. These improvements in reporting notwithstanding, a number of
breaks remain in the series, and comparable historical data are not available. Balance of
payments data are reported on an annual basis for publication in the Balance of Payments
Statistics Yearbook and the IFS.

- 57 -

ANNEX IV

20.
Since 1994, China’s Ministry of Finance (MOF) has regularly reported annual GFS
data for publication in the GFS Yearbook. The GFS database currently includes data on the
central government budget for 1990–2001, and on provincial and local governments for
1995–2001. The MOF also reports annual GFS data for publication in IFS although with
substantial delays. Data through 1998, relate to revenue, expenditure, and the deficit/surplus
of the central, provincial, county-level, and municipal governments' budgets.
21.
Reporting of data to STA for IFS has, in the past, tended to be sporadic and with a
considerable time lag. Following the introduction of new reporting arrangements, the
timeliness of consumer price, industrial production, trade value, and total GDP data in IFS
has improved substantially. However, the range of information is relatively limited, with no
data published on producer prices, wages, trade volumes or prices/unit values.
Data dissemination to the public
22.
The publication of a quarterly statistical bulletin by the PBC has significantly
improved the timing and coverage of publicly available data on the monetary accounts and
the main real sector indicators. However, the monthly statistical publications do not contain
many time series (e.g. unemployment) or the disaggregation necessary for analysis.
Moreover, several important time series, particularly on the main fiscal variables, are not
released in a systematic and timely manner. Extensive annual economic data are available in
various statistical yearbooks, but these are published nine months or more after the end of the
year.

CHINA—RELATIONS WITH THE WORLD BANK1
1.
The World Bank has been active in China since 1980. World Bank commitments to China
as of June 30, 2005 totaled about $38.9 billion for 263 projects. About 90 of these projects are still
under implementation, making China's portfolio the largest in the Bank. World Bank-supported
projects are found in almost all parts of China and in many sectors of the economy, with
infrastructure (transport, energy, industry, urban development) accounting for more than half of
the total portfolio, and agriculture, social sectors (health, education, social protection),
environment, and water supply and sanitation comprising the remainder.
2.
In FY2005, lending is projected to total about $1.0 billion in IBRD loans for nine projects.
Given the increased availability of domestic financing—as a result of China's fiscal stimulus
policy—and a shift of the government's development program to the central and western areas, the
focus of the World Bank's assistance program is now on the poorer and institutionally weaker
inland provinces. As a consequence, the amount of lending per project has been scaled back to
suit the absorptive capacity of those provinces, leading to a lower lending level compared with the
mid-1990s. By sector, the projects to be approved in FY2005 include two for agricultural
development in poor rural areas, four for urban environmental improvements in Chongqing,
Hunan, Liuzhou and Ningbo, one for transport and trade facilitation in Inner Mongolia, one for
renewable energy, and one for managing the Tai Basin. A summary of Bank commitments and
disbursement to China is given in Table V.1. Details of the sectoral breakdown of past lending can
be found in Table V.2.
3.
Over the next two years, lending is expected to range from $2.0-3.0 billion, with support
provided to economic reform, the development of health, agriculture and infrastructure in the
interior provinces and in the provinces of NE China, and urban management and the environment
principally in these areas. Since China is no longer borrowing IDA funds, the Bank, in
collaboration with the government and the United Kingdom’s Department for International
Development (DFID), has developed a mechanism to blend grant resources with IBRD loans,
resulting in more concessional loans (at an interest rate of about 2 percent) for selected projects in
the social and rural sectors. The FY2004 Basic Education Project and FY2005 Poor Rural
Communities Development Project were supported by this mechanism. In FY2006 a rural water
supply and sanitation project is also expected to benefit from this mechanism.
4.
The current World Bank Group Country Assistance Strategy (CAS), covering both lending
and non-lending activities, is designed to help China: (i) improve the business environment and
accelerate the transition to a market economy, mostly through an array of knowledge transfer
activities; (ii) address the needs of the poorer and disadvantaged people and lagging regions,
through investment lending in rural development, infrastructure, and the social sectors, as well as
analytical and advisory services and training; and (iii) facilitate an environmentally sustainable

1

- 60 -

ANNEX V

development process, through investment lending in natural resource management, watershed
rehabilitation and wastewater treatment, energy, global environment projects supported by the
Global Environment Facility and Montreal Protocol, and policy work. A new CAS is under
preparation.
5.
In addition to financial assistance, the provision of non-financial services in the form of
technical assistance, policy advice, seminars and training is an essential part of the cooperation
program. The government has strongly endorsed Bank efforts to make its non-lending activities
more responsive to the country's evolving needs, by having a better balance between detailed
studies of issues requiring lengthy technical analysis and quick delivery of briefer policy notes,
supplemented by other forms of collaboration such as senior-level workshops. Some recent or
upcoming outputs include: support to formulation of the 11th Five-Year Plan; an economic
memorandum on managing scarce resources; issues in the management of economic crises
(building on previous work on public expenditures, including at the sub-national level, and on the
management of fiscal and financial risks); studies of public service unit reforms, national market
integration, maximizing rural health contributions to growth and employment, rural social
protection, and labor reform; and a financial sector program focused on capital market
development, banking reform, infrastructure finance and rural finance. In FY2005, besides
continuing support on the 11th Plan, the World Bank has been assisting on, among other things,
intergovernmental fiscal and regional development issues (focused particularly on the Northeast),
a study of public finance reform for rural development, a poverty assessment as well as major
programs of work on the financial sector and rural health.
Representation:

The People’s Republic of China assumed China’s representation in
the World Bank on May 15, 1980.

Capital Subscription:

China holds 4,480 million shares or 2.85 percent of the total
authorized capital of the IBRD. Currently, China is fully subscribed.

Technical Assistance:

A technical assistance loan to the People's Bank of China to
enhance the central bank’s supervision, research, and clearing
capabilities was approved in FY1993. A second technical assistance
project, approved in the same year, is financing reform-supportive
studies and economic research, the strengthening of core agencies
responsible for macroeconomic management and local training
institutions, and preinvestment support. Technical assistance for
economic law reform was approved in FY1995. Fiscal technical
assistance, also approved in FY1995, supported the

- 61 -

ANNEX V

implementation of a broad range of public sector reforms.
Assistance in bond market development has also been provided. In
FY1999, technical assistance projects were approved for reform of
accounting, pension and enterprise systems. Further technical
assistance support for economic research and preinvestment was
also provided in FY1999. A supplemental loan for financial sector
technical assistance was approved in FY2001. A large program of
technical assistance is currently financed by trust funds from within
and outside the Bank, covering economic and financial sector
reform, statistical reform, poverty issues, social sectors, debt
management, and social security.
Resident Mission:

International Finance
Corporation (IFC):

A resident IBRD office in Beijing has been in operation since
October 1985. In October 1997, responsibility for managing the
Bank’s total program for China was decentralized to the Beijing
office.

As of March 31, 2005, IFC has committed financing for 83 projects
in China. For these projects IFC has provided US$673 million:
US$589 million for IFC’s own account, and US$84 million for the
account of participating banks. A resident IFC office in Beijing has
been in operation since 1992. In July 2000, a joint IFC/World Bank
regional office for private sector development was established in
Hong Kong SAR, with management of this program decentralized
to that office.
IFC's priorities in China include: supporting private sector
development in interior provinces; expanding the presence of
private enterprises in infrastructure, social services, and
environmental technology sectors; and improving the business
environment, particularly as it relates to financial markets, private
participation in infrastructure, and small and medium enterprises.

ANNEX VI

CHINA—RELATIONS WITH THE ASIAN DEVELOPMENT BANK
1.
The Asian Development Bank’s operation in the PRC focuses on a set of four
interrelated challenges: (i) promoting pro-poor inclusive economic growth; (ii) building an
enabling environment for the private sector and strengthening public sector governance;
(iii) fostering regional cooperation to help integrate the PRC into the global economy; and
(iv) promoting environmental sustainability.
2.
Since China became a member of ADB in 1986, 107 public sector loans totaling
$14.7 billion and 449 technical assistance projects amounting to $239.3 million have been
approved as of end-December 2004. In addition, ADB has 11 private sector loans totaling
$171.5 million in loan and $134.3 million in equity as of 31 December 2004.
3.
Infrastructure, urban development, environmental improvement and rural and
agriculture development will remain Government’s priority sectors identified for ADB
assistance. ADB lending will continue to focus on the central, western and northeastern
provinces.
4.
The Country Strategy and Program Update (2005 –2007) has programmed a total loan
assistance of $4.6 billion for the period 2005-2007, amounting to an annual average lending
of about $1.5 billion. Of this, 59 percent is for the transport sector, 13 percent for the
agriculture and natural resources sector, 16 percent for the social infrastructure sector,
9 percent in the energy sector and 3 percent for multi-sectors. More than 80 percent of the
loan projects are located in the central and western provinces compared to about 59 percent
during 1986-2004.
5.
The ADB’s lending program will continue to be supported by technical assistance. The
annual nonlending program amounts to around $11 million for the period 2005-2007. TAs
for operational support cover: (a) transport, (b) energy, (c) land management, (d) water
supply and wastewater treatment, (e) urban development, (f) education and health, and
(g) environment. TAs for policy impacts and knowledge-based products fall into the
following areas: (a) poverty reduction for policy reform and deepening the impact of ADB
lending projects, (b) financial sector reform, (c) law and development, (d) social security
reform, and (e) fiscal reform.
6.
Overall, China has demonstrated strong project implementation capability. The good
performance reflects the strong sense of project ownership among agencies involved in the
design, implementation, and management of projects, as well as the rigorous screening
process for development projects, particularly those proposed for external assistance. Loan
disbursement and contract award performance is good.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND
PEOPLE’S REPUBLIC OF CHINA
Staff Report for the 2005 Article IV Consultation
Supplementary Information
Prepared by the Staff Representatives for the 2005 Consultation with the
People’s Republic of China
Approved by David Burton and Carlos Muñiz
August 1, 2005
1.
This supplement updates recent economic and policy developments since the staff
report for the 2005 Article IV consultation (7/8/05) was issued. These developments
support the thrust of the staff appraisal. In particular, macroeconomic developments
reinforce the need to ensure that investment growth slows sufficiently in the remainder of
2005, and underscore the importance of fully utilizing the flexibility in the new exchange
rate regime to provide more room for monetary policy independence and enhance the
government's ability to manage the economy.
Recent economic developments
2.
Recent data indicate that the growth momentum in the economy remains
strong. GDP grew by 9½ percent in the first half of 2005, with the contribution of net
exports remaining large. Growth in real fixed asset investment remains high, and there
appears to be continuing strength in consumption, as suggested by retail sales figures.
Inflation remains subdued, with the increase in the CPI falling slightly to 1.6 percent
(year-on-year) in June, reflecting a further decline in the pace of food price growth.
3.
China’s strong trade performance through June contributed to a further
increase in reserves. The trend of strong export growth and weaker import growth
continued, resulting in a trade surplus for the first half of 2005 of $40 billion, compared to
a $7 billion deficit for the same period in 2004. These figures point to the possibility that
the current account surplus for the year could exceed the staff’s forecast of 6 percent of
GDP. The strong trade performance in June, together with continued capital inflows,
contributed to a further increase in international reserves, which reached $711 billion by
the end of the month (an increase of $101 billion in the first half of the year, excluding the
$15 billion capital injection to the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China in April).
4.
Recent monetary and fiscal developments are in line with staff projections.
Credit growth in June increased slightly to 13¼ percent (year-on-year), but remains below
the 2004 rate of 14½ percent. Budget revenue through end-June has grown by
13½ percent (year-on-year), higher than the budgeted annual growth target of 11 percent.

- 68 -

ANNEX VI

Underlying revenue growth has been even stronger. Excluding the clearance of arrears and
current VAT tax rebates to exporters (which were more than three times the cumulative
amount paid in the first half of 2004), tax revenue grew by more than 20 percent. These
developments are in line with the staff’s expectation that the revenue outturn for 2005
could once again exceed the budgeted projection by a substantial amount.
5.
International rating agencies have recently upgraded their assessment of
China. Standard and Poor’s recently upgraded China’s sovereign credit rating to A- from
BBB+, citing the government's aggressive restructuring of its financial sector combined
with improved profitability of the state-owned enterprises. Likewise, Moody's raised their
ratings for major Chinese banks, including BOC, CCB, ICBC, and Bank of
Communications, reflecting in part efforts to restructure these banks.
Exchange rate policy developments
6.
The authorities have made an important move toward greater flexibility of
the exchange rate. On July 21, the People’s Bank of China (PBC) announced that the
exchange rate of the renminbi against the U.S. dollar would be revalued upward by about
2 percent (from RMB 8.28/US$ to RMB 8.11/US$) and the exchange rate regime would
be changed to set the renminbi’s value with reference to a basket of currencies. The
authorities indicated that they will not publish the currencies in the reference basket and
their relative weights, and many of the operational details regarding the new arrangement
remain unclear at this time. Daily fluctuations in the renminbi-U.S. dollar exchange rate
will remain limited, as before, to ±0.3 percent around a central rate set by the PBC based
on the rate at the market closing on the previous day. Daily fluctuations of the renminbi
against non-U.S. currencies will be limited to ±1.5 percent. The PBC indicated that it
would adjust the exchange rate trading band as necessary to reflect market developments
and financial and economic conditions. At the same time, the official announcement
underscored the PBC’s responsibility for fostering “macroeconomic and financial
stability” and “for maintaining the RMB exchange rate basically stable at an adaptive and
equilibrium level.” Since July 21, the renminbi has traded in a very narrow range, and
remains largely unchanged in relation to its revalued rate against the U.S. dollar. At the
market close on August 1, the renminbi-U.S. dollar rate was at RMB 8.1046/US$.
7.
The staff welcomes this change in the exchange rate regime and encourages
the authorities to fully utilize the scope for flexibility afforded by the new
arrangement. The authorities have stressed that the currency basket is simply a reference
and that the value of the renminbi is not being pegged to it. There is room built into the
new arrangement that can be used to impart a fair degree of flexibility in the exchange
rate, albeit gradually. While it is understandable that the authorities may want to limit
volatility in the initial weeks after the adoption of the new arrangement to help domestic
market participants adapt to the new regime and to influence market expectations, greater
exchange rate flexibility remains in China’s best interest. It is key in providing scope for
monetary policy independence and enhancing the authorities’ ability to manage the
economy.

Public Information Notice (PIN) No. 05/122
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
September 12, 2005

Washington, D. C. 20431 USA

IMF Concludes 2005 Article IV Consultation with
the People's Republic of China
On August 3, 2005, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF)
concluded the Article IV consultation with the People's Republic of China.1
Background
China’s rapid economic growth and integration into the global economy continued apace.
GDP grew by 9½ percent in 2004 and in the first half of 2005, while its composition shifted
as investment growth moderated somewhat and the contribution from net exports increased.
Retail sales growth remained robust, suggesting continued strong consumer demand. After
peaking at 5.3 percent (year-on-year) in the third quarter of 2004, inflation declined to
1.8 percent in July 2005, largely due to a reversal of food price increases as agricultural
production rose.
The external current account surplus rose to $69 billion (4¼ percent of GDP) in 2004, as
export growth remained strong throughout the year, while import growth slowed, reflecting
some moderation in investment and an increase in the supply of some domestic import
substitutes. China’s trade balance strengthened further in the first seven months of 2005,
with exports increasing by 32 percent (year-on-year), while imports grew by 14 percent.
A larger external current account surplus, together with strong capital inflows, led to a further
sizable increase in gross official reserves. Reserves increased by $207 billion in 2004 and
1

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies.
On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion
by the Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as
Chairman of the Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is
transmitted to the country's authorities. This PIN summarizes the views of the Executive
Board as expressed during the August 3, 2005 Executive Board discussion based on the
staff report.

- 70 by a further $101 billion in the first half of 2005 (excluding $15 billion in reserves used for
bank recapitalization), bringing the level at end-June to $719 billion. While FDI inflows
(mainly from Hong Kong SAR, Korea, and Japan) remained strong, a substantial part of the
reserve accumulation over this period was accounted for by net non-FDI capital inflows
(including errors and omissions) largely attracted by the prospects of a renminbi
appreciation.
During 2004, the authorities took a number of steps to tighten macroeconomic policies. The
People’s Bank of China (PBC) raised the reserve requirement ratio and short-term relending and rediscount rates, increased bank deposit and lending interest rates, and
eliminated the ceiling on lending rates. These measures were supplemented with guidance
provided by the PBC and the China Bank Regulatory Commission to influence banks’
lending decisions. As a result of these measures, and restrained lending by the three large
state-owned banks that have been recapitalized, broad money growth declined to
15.7 percent and loan growth to 13.2 percent by June 2005, down by around 4 and
7¾ percentage points, respectively, from their growth rates in 2003. Nevertheless,
considerable liquidity remains in the banking system, reflected in the still high excess
reserve ratio and low interbank interest rates. On the fiscal side, the deficit fell to 1½ percent
of GDP, about one percentage point of GDP below its targeted level in the 2004 budget and
the actual outcome for the deficit in 2003. This was helped by strong revenue
overperformance, about half of which was used to finance increases in social expenditure
and subsidies and to clear up old government liabilities, including arrears on VAT refunds to
exporters.
Real GDP growth is projected to slow slightly during the year and to average around
9 percent in 2005, assuming that appropriate macroeconomic policies will be in place to
further slow investment growth. The external current account surplus is expected to increase
2 percentage points to 6 percent of GDP, mainly reflecting strong export growth and lower
import growth. Inflation should average around 3 percent in 2005, as slower food price
increases will likely be partially offset by a rise in non-food prices as some of last year’s
rapid producer price increases is passed through to consumer prices and certain
administered prices are raised. A significant risk remains that, as large capital inflows add
liquidity to the banking system, macroeconomic policies would need to be tightened further if
investment growth rebounded. Protectionist sentiments in some of China’s trading partner
countries have increased in recent months, particularly after textile exports from China to
these countries grew sharply with the end of the quota system. A further intensification of
such sentiments could adversely affect exports. Moreover, a disorderly unwinding of global
current account imbalances would also threaten China’s growth, as economic activity in all
countries would likely suffer lingering adverse effects.

- 71 China has continued to implement a broad range of structural reforms. In the banking
sector, progress has been made in strengthening supervision and improving bank
operations, especially in the three large state-owned commercial banks, which have been
recapitalized. State-owned enterprises have become more market oriented and corporate
and management restructuring has continued. A number of steps also have been taken in
line with China’s WTO commitments, including further tariff reductions that lowered the
unweighted average tariff rate by half a percentage point to 10 percent in 2005.
Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors commended the authorities for the success in sustaining high economic
growth rates and for their efforts over the past year to guide the economy toward a soft
landing. While recent data suggest that growth has shifted away from investment toward
consumption and exports, and inflation has come down, the risk of a rebound in credit
growth and investment calls for continued vigilance, given the considerable liquidity already
in the banking system. Directors noted that medium-term prospects are generally favorable,
although oil price volatility, a disorderly resolution of global imbalances, and trade
restrictions against China could pose potential challenges for the authorities. They stressed
that appropriate policy responses and continued implementation of structural reform,
particularly in the financial sector, public finances, and the labor market, will help establish a
solid foundation for China’s further integration into the global economy and improve living
standards and income distribution across regions.
In view of the need to ensure that the pace of investment and credit growth remains in
check, Directors generally considered that steps should be taken to drain more of the
excess liquidity out of the banking system through open market operations. Moreover, the
authorities should stand ready to take other policy actions, including increases in interest
rates and reserve requirements, if investment and lending show signs of resurgence. A few
Directors recommended a cautious approach to further tightening, particularly given
evidence of excess capacity in certain sectors. Directors also noted that the effectiveness of
monetary policy would be greatly enhanced by granting the People’s Bank of China (PBC)
more discretion over interest rate policy. They recognized that administrative measures
remain necessary and effective for curbing credit growth in certain sectors, given the stage
of China’s financial sector development. Nevertheless, Directors called on the authorities to
gradually increase reliance on market-based instruments. Enhanced supervision of bank
lending and strengthened prudential rules should also help keep near-term credit growth in
check and enhance overall financial stability.
Directors noted that the widening current account surplus over the past two years, combined
with continued strong capital inflows, has led to a large build-up in international reserves and
has complicated the conduct of monetary policy. Against this background, Directors
welcomed the change in the exchange rate regime—an important move toward greater
exchange rate flexibility—and encouraged the authorities to utilize the flexibility afforded by
the new arrangement. Noting the difficulty in assessing with a reasonable degree of
confidence the “equilibrium” exchange rate for China, they agreed that a more flexible
exchange rate, not simply a revaluation, is key to providing scope for monetary policy
independence and enhancing the economy’s resilience to external shocks. Going forward,
many Directors supported a gradual, cautious approach to further increasing exchange rate
flexibility, in order to coordinate such steps with financial sector reforms and capital account

- 72 liberalization, and to allow time for the economy to adjust and for market-based instruments
to be developed further. However, a number of other Directors recommended that the
authorities allow the exchange rate to move more quickly toward a level that better reflects
underlying market forces.
Directors emphasized that greater exchange rate flexibility is in China’s best interest. They
also considered that, as correcting global imbalances is a responsibility of all the major
countries, China’s move toward greater exchange rate flexibility would contribute directly to
that process, as well as indirectly by facilitating greater exchange rate adjustments in other
Asian countries.
Directors agreed that the likely outturn of the 2005 budget is broadly appropriate. They
welcomed in particular the shift in expenditure from investment to social spending, and
urged further reallocation in this direction to help constrain investment growth while
increasing much needed spending on health and education. Directors encouraged the
authorities to save any revenue overperformance that accrues to the central government,
thereby helping to restrain domestic demand.
Directors supported the authorities’ aim to continue fiscal consolidation over the medium
term in order to keep debt at sustainable levels while meeting growing demands on public
funds, including potentially large contingent liabilities. Most Directors encouraged further
significant cuts in the nominal deficit target when conditions permit, and saw scope for such
a reduction in the 2006 budget, on the expectation that revenue would continue to
overperform relative to the budget projection and that all outstanding arrears on VAT
refunds would be cleared in 2005. A few Directors cautioned that the need for further fiscal
consolidation should be weighed against China’s large infrastructure and social spending
needs.
Directors emphasized that fiscal consolidation should be accompanied by strengthening the
structure of the public finances, reforming the tax system, and addressing structural
imbalances in subnational finances, including by clarifying expenditure responsibilities and
reforming the transfer system to move toward a more rule-based equalization system. The
central government should also make adequate resources available to local governments to
fund existing pension and other social liabilities. Fiscal management should be strengthened
further, particularly by adopting a revised budget classification system and expanding the
coverage of the treasury single account.
Directors welcomed the focus being placed on financial sector restructuring to improve
intermediation of China’s large private savings. They welcomed in particular the progress
made in three of the four large state-owned commercial banks, and urged that a
restructuring plan be formulated for the Agricultural Bank to ensure the health of the banking
system. Directors emphasized the need for all banks to strengthen their balance sheets, and
improve their commercial orientation, risk management, internal controls, and governance.
They welcomed the liberalization of lending rates, which was an important step taken by the
PBC to help develop the banking sector and encourage banks to improve the pricing of risk.
Further efforts are needed to eliminate the involvement of government in bank management
and business operations. Diversifying bank ownership could bring much needed technical
expertise and enhance governance.

- 73 Directors commended the China Bank Regulatory Commission for the progress in improving
bank supervision. Further efforts will be needed to ensure that all banks can comply with
capital adequacy requirements with full provisioning as required by existing guidelines.
Directors stressed that the adoption of a new bankruptcy law that provides sufficient
protection to creditors and allows for an adequate market mechanism to facilitate liquidation
will be important for resolving existing and future non-performing loans in an orderly manner.
Directors welcomed China’s decision to participate in an FSAP and looked forward to an
early assessment. They welcomed the authorities’ commitment to curb money laundering
and combat the financing of terrorism, and looked forward to the enactment of
comprehensive legislation that is consistent with the core recommendations of the Financial
Action Task Force.
Directors supported the plans to accelerate the development of bond and equity markets.
They noted that a key first step would be to eliminate the current system of government
approval for corporate bond issuance, and replace it with a more market-oriented system
based on disclosure of operational and financial information for issuing firms. In addition,
removing the cap on corporate bond interest rates would allow proper pricing of such bonds.
It is also important to limit the use of public resources to protect investors, which could lead
to moral hazard.
Directors observed that state-owned enterprises (SOEs) have become more market
oriented, with corporate and management restructuring and increased foreign ownership.
Nevertheless, additional reforms are still needed to ensure their long-term viability. Directors
urged the government to exercise stronger governance over the SOEs. Strengthening the
ownership role of the State Asset Supervision and Administration Commission and requiring
profitable SOEs to pay dividends to the government are essential to focus enterprises more
on increasing their net worth.
Directors welcomed improvements in the quality of economic statistics, but noted that
incomplete data in several areas still hamper the monitoring of macroeconomic
developments. A continuing priority for further improvement is the compilation and timely
publication of annual and quarterly real GDP data on an expenditure basis. Directors
encouraged the authorities to make full use of Fund technical assistance to improve balance
of payments statistics and ensure that the reporting of data on the international investment
position is completed as soon as feasible.
