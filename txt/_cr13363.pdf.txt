STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2013 ARTICLE IV CONSULTATION
November 1, 2013

KEY ISSUES
Context: Economic activity has accelerated, in part thanks to pro-cyclical
macroeconomic policies. With domestic demand stronger, the current account deficit is
widening again from a high level, and inflation remains well above target.
Challenges: On current policies, Turkey can only sustain high growth at the expense of
growing external imbalances. Short- and medium-run policies should focus on reducing
external vulnerabilities, so Turkey can break free of its boom and bust cycles.
Key policy recommendations:
 Re-establish a nominal anchor. Despite higher interest rates, monetary policy
remains too loose given the inflation target. The policy framework should be normalized
with a clearer focus on inflation.
 Tighten the fiscal stance. Expenditures should be reined in and higher-than-expected
revenues saved. The 2014 budget should target a primary balance consistent with a
0.7 percent of GDP structural improvement.
 There is room for policy action in case of downside risks, but discretionary stimulus
should be applied only if growth is expected to turn negative.
 Increasing national savings and improving competitiveness are central to addressing
vulnerabilities. Ambitious medium-term fiscal targets (consistent with a 2 percent of GDP
consolidation over the next five years) and deepened structural reforms are needed.
Traction of past Fund advice: The authorities share staff’s view on the need to raise
savings, as reflected in the 2014 Medium-Term Plan and their 10th development plan. In
addition, they introduced macro-prudential measures to address growing leverage by
households in line with Fund advice, and more is under consideration. However, they
have a more benign view of external vulnerabilities, therefore monetary and fiscal
policies are looser than what staff recommends. The authorities also concur that
lowering inflation is a key objective, but believe their monetary framework serves them
well and intend to continue with the normalization of the policy framework.

CONTEXT
1.
Turkey achieved a welcome reduction of imbalances in 2012. The economy had grown
by an average of 9 percent over 2010–11, opening up a positive output gap and bringing the
current account deficit to 9.7 percent of GDP. However, monetary tightening starting in the second
half of 2011 slowed growth in 2012 to 2.2 percent on the back of a 1.8 percent contraction in
domestic demand. Exports were a bright spot however, thanks to successful diversification away
from traditional European Union markets and towards MENA as well as one-off factors (see below).
The combination of weak imports and strong exports helped narrow the current account deficit to
6.1 percent of GDP. Inflation also decelerated to 6.2 percent at end-2012 versus 10.4 percent a year
earlier. Reflecting the reduced imbalances and improved outlook, Turkey has been upgraded by two
credit rating agencies to investment grade since the last Article IV consultation.
2.
However, much of the rebalancing was cyclical. In 2012, staff estimates that about three
quarters of the current account adjustment was due to a cyclical compression in imports,1 as well as
exceptionally high net gold exports.2 Moreover, the adjustment came from a decline in (not
particularly high) investment rather than from a needed increase in savings. Staff believes the
current account deficit remains 1½−3 percent of GDP higher than warranted by fundamentals and
optimal policy settings. Thus, the estimated exchange rate misalignment is 10–20 percent, even after
the recent depreciation.
3.
Reducing the still-high vulnerabilities should be the focus of short and medium-term
policies. Notwithstanding the recent adjustment, inflation remains high, and staff projects that the
current account deficit will remain in the 7−8½ percent of GDP range on current policies, implying
gross external financing requirements exceeding 25 percent of GDP per year. As a result, the net
foreign asset position, which has already deteriorated by about 25 percentage points of GDP since
2008, will continue to worsen. These trends are not sustainable, and Turkey could sooner or later
suffer a sharp adjustment if they are not redressed.
4.
Turkey is entering a long electoral cycle. Local elections are currently planned for spring
2014, presidential elections for summer 2014, and parliamentary elections for 2015, with a possible
constitutional referendum in between. The Justice and Development Party of Prime Minister
Erdoğan has been in power since 2002.

Most of the gold exported was obtained by drawing down inventories rather than via imports of gold. This led to a
gold surplus in excess of US$10 billion, a one-off occurrence.

BACKGROUND
A. Recent Developments
5.
Growth accelerated significantly in the first half of this year. In the first two quarters,
GDP grew by 1.5 and 2.1 percent q-o-q (seasonally adjusted, non-annualized) respectively, after
stagnating in the second half of 2012. The acceleration in activity was led by private consumption
and public investment. Despite the impressive pace in sequential terms, GDP in the first half of the
year was only 3.7 percent higher than over the same period last year, purely due to weak growth in
the second half of last year. More recently, high frequency data suggest that growth slowed down in
the third quarter, likely due to the impact of tighter financial conditions, although it remained in
positive territory.
6.
Policy stimulus has played a big part in the rebound. Starting in the third quarter of last
year, the central bank lowered the top end of the corridor by more than 500 basis points and the
policy rate by 125 bps. The latter was about 2 percent negative in real terms at the end of the easing
cycle. As a result of the monetary policy loosening, credit growth accelerated sharply over the last
year, reaching peaks of close to 40 percent in annualized terms in mid year. Loose fiscal policy also
contributed to aggregate demand, with nominal primary spending growing at more than 15 percent
y-o-y for most of the last twelve months. Capital expenditure was the main driver, but other items
such as personnel spending are also growing at double digits.
7.
With the rotation back to domestic demand-led growth, external and internal
imbalances are widening again. Last year was unusual for Turkey, as growth was entirely driven by
net exports and the positive output gap was reduced significantly without a contraction in overall
GDP. But the first half of 2013 saw a more standard growth pattern with domestic demand leading
the way, pushing imports up by 10 percent y-o-y. In addition, and despite relatively resilient exports,
the current account deficit has been gradually widening, in part due to the normalization in the net
gold balance after last year’s exceptional surplus. In the year-to-date, the current account deficit has
reached US$44.3 billion, compared with US$35.4 billion over the same period last year. The deficit is
financed mostly by short term flows, with very little contribution of FDI flows so far in 2013, and a
significant increase in portfolio inflows despite some recent pullback. Inflation is also accelerating,
reaching 7.9 percent y-o-y in September compared with 6.2 percent at the end of last year. Core
inflation measures also accelerated to about 7½ percent.
8.
The emerging market risk episode hit Turkish assets hard and forced some policy
tightening on the central bank. Lower global appetite for emerging market assets following
expectations of tapering by the U.S. Federal Reserve exposed Turkey’s Achilles heel: its large external
financing needs and short term funding composition. Since May, the government benchmark bond
rate has increased by some 300 basis points, the exchange rate has depreciated by more than
10 percent against the euro-dollar basket, and stock prices have fallen by close to 20 percent.
Concurrent political demonstrations in Turkey added to uncertainty. Pressure on the lira led the
central bank to hike the top end of the corridor by 125 basis points, and suspend liquidity provision
INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

5

TURKEY

at the policy rate (which it has not hiked) during designated exceptional days. This resulted in an
average increase of about 200 basis points in interbank rates. In addition, the CBRT intervened in FX
markets via auctions by about US$11.5 billion (more than 15 percent of net international reserves) to
slow down depreciation. Despite the tightening, the central bank continues to provide liquidity at
negative real rates, and fiscal policy has remained expansionary.

B. Outlook and Risks
9.
Staff expects growth to reach 3.8 percent this year and 3.5 percent next. Relative to the
strong pace of growth in the first half of the year, the current baseline assumes a significant
deceleration in the second half, a result of lower confidence due to the recent volatility as well as
tighter financing conditions. However, with financial conditions and confidence expected to
normalize, and on current policies, growth should re-accelerate into 2014, with the lower annual
number purely a matter of base effects. In terms of GDP composition, both 2013 and 2014 are
expected to be led by domestic demand. In 2013, domestic demand growth is projected at
4.8 percent, as a result of strong private consumption and public investment, while the net export
contribution will swing to -1 percentage points from last year’s exceptional 4.1.
10.
In this context, imbalances are set to widen. With the strong import pick-up relative to
2012, and with one-off factors that led to large net gold exports last year waning, the current
account deficit is forecasted to increase from 6.1 percent of GDP in 2012 to 7.4 percent this year and
7.2 next. This, combined with the short-term nature of the foreign financing, will imply gross external
financing needs in excess of 25 percent of GDP annually. Also, with the pick-up in domestic demand
and pass-through from the lira depreciation, staff expects inflation of 8 percent at year end
(7.7 percent average inflation), well above the central bank’s 5 percent target. On current policies,
inflation is not expected to return to target next year either.
11.
The medium term baseline requires a continued willingness of investors to finance
large and growing external deficits, which carries significant risks (see Box 1). On current
policies, the baseline projects a gradual convergence towards 4½ percent growth rates in line with
the historical trend growth. However, given present levels of savings, such growth would entail a
widening of the current account deficit from its already high level, reaching 8¼ percent of GDP in
2018. As such, the medium-term baseline is associated with an increasing vulnerability to capital
flow weakening or even a sharp reversal.
12.
A sudden stop in capital flows would trigger a significant economic adjustment. The
combination of expected monetary policy normalization in the United States and a growth
slowdown in emerging economies could result in a sharp and sustained reversal of inflows. Given
the size of Turkey’s current account deficit, a sudden stop in inflows (one sharper and more
sustained than the one seen in recent months) would require a large compression in absorption to
close the external deficit, leading to negative GDP growth. The growth path then would look much
less benign than in the staff’s baseline.

13.
Given buffers in the system and the state of balance sheets, a plausible growth and
exchange rate shock in line with 2008–09 is unlikely to lead at this stage to a systemic event:


Households: Their net financial asset position is positive at about 20 percent of GDP. Leverage in
this sector has increased considerably in recent years, with household debt rising from less than
30 percent of disposable income in 2006 to 50 percent now−still not large by international and
peer standards. In addition, debt servicing risks are mitigated by the fact that most loans are at
fixed interest rates, although the relatively short maturity of household debt (4.1 years on
average) implies principal payments of about 20 percent of disposable income. Crucially,
households do not carry foreign exchange (FX) risk, as banks are not allowed to lend to them in
foreign currency.



Public sector: government debt remains low at 35 percent of GDP, and in recent years the profile
of this debt has improved considerably, both in terms of longer maturities and lower foreign
exchange exposure (only a third of public debt carries FX risk). As noted in Annex I, debt
sustainability does not represent a risk on current policies and debt is resilient to standard
shocks. External financing risk is the most notable public debt vulnerability.



Non-financial corporates: as with households, leverage has increased considerably in recent
years. Yet the debt service remains within their capacity to repay at least in the corporates for
which data exist: earnings before interest, taxes and depreciation are more than twice debt
service payments, considerably higher than only a few years ago. The most concerning aspect is
the widening short FX position of the non-financial corporates. This has jumped from
US$78 billion in 2008 to US$165 billion now. However: (i) the vast majority of this short FX
position is accounted for by long term debt, reducing rollover risks; (ii) only slightly more than
half of the corporates’ FX liabilities are vis-à-vis the domestic banking system; (iii) by regulation,
FX loans can only be granted to large corporates (and only at maturity of more than one year) or
to companies with FX receipts; and (iv) the floating exchange regime reduces the probability of a
very large and abrupt adjustment in the exchange rate..



Banks: the evolution of banks’ balance sheets mirrors that in other sectors, with a significant
increase in leverage but not yet reaching alarming levels. The loan-to-deposit ratio has
increased sharply from 76 percent in 2009 to around 110 percent now. Capital buffers remain
strong, with the capital adequacy ratio at 16 percent. Although there is an FX maturity mismatch,
liquid FX assets cover more than 100 percent of the banks’ short term FX liabilities. While banks
have only a small on-balance sheet FX exposure (about US$20 billion) fully closed via swaps,
they do carry indirect FX risk via their lending to corporates. A large devaluation could convey
these risks onto banks as increased NPLs. Nevertheless, stress stemming from this channel
should be manageable given existing buffers and low levels of NPLs.



Foreign reserve buffers: gross reserves have increased significantly over the last 18 months to
reach US$130 billion. They now account for about 115 percent of the Fund’s metric versus
98 percent at end 2011. Thus, by this metric, reserves appear reasonable, even if not as ample as
those of other emerging markets. However, the reassuring signal of reserve adequacy provided
by the Fund metric is largely a result of the interplay between the reserve option mechanism

(ROM) and gross international reserves (see below)3. In practice, the increase in gross reserves
has not been matched by a corresponding increase in net reserves, which at US$50 billion
remain small given Turkey’s external financing needs.

Box 2. Medium-Term Program, 2014–16
1

The macroeconomic assumptions underlying the medium-term program (MTP) are more
conservative than last year’s. In particular, the growth trajectory has been shifted downwards by
1 percentage point in 2014 and inflation has been revised up for 2013–14. The MTP has placed the
emphasis on reducing the current account deficit. The authorities expect that with the policies underlying
the MTP, the current account deficit will decline to 5½ percent of GDP by 2016. In particular, the MTP
cites higher domestic savings, stimulated through structural and macro-prudential measures, as well as
increasing energy efficiency and lower gold imports as the key factors behind the reduction in the current
account.
These assumptions are more upbeat than those of staff. Notably: (i) the economy is assumed to grow
by 4–5 percent in 2014–16 versus 3½–4½ percent in the staff’s scenario; (ii) inflation is projected to fall
rapidly and converge close to the central bank’s 5 percent target, whereas staff do not expect the target
to be reached; (iii) most importantly, the authorities see the current account deficit narrowing despite an
acceleration in growth, whereas staff expect the deficit to widen.
The new MTP envisages a slightly more ambitious path for the public sector primary surplus than
its predecessor. However, it again allows spending pressures to move in line with higher expected
revenues. Relative to the last year’s MTP, primary spending will increase by ½ percent of GDP, on account
of higher capital spending. For 2014, the new MTP envisages a decline in primary spending of 0.4 percent
explained by the unwinding of the previous year’s increase in capital expenditures, whereas current
spending continues its upward trend.
Staff projects a much less favorable medium-term fiscal outlook. While the authorities expect the
central government’s primary surplus to reach 1.0 percent of GDP by 2016, staff forecast a primary deficit
of 0.1 percent of GDP. About two thirds of the discrepancy between staff’s projections and the new MTP
are on the spending side, with revenues accounting for the rest. In particular, staff assumes a more
modest decline in current spending as a share of GDP and sees risks to the assumed compression in
capital spending in 2014.

14.
However, external imbalances still need to be addressed quickly. Each year that
imbalances (excessive credit growth and large current account deficit) go un-addressed, stock
imbalances get worse and balance sheets become more stretched. Over the last three years FX
lending of banks to non-financial corporates has grown much faster than exports, representing a
growing vulnerability4. Turkey’s net foreign asset position of close to -50 percent of GDP has also
deteriorated noticeably in recent years. This increases the probability that any future sharp economic
adjustment could lead to systemic distress. Alternatively, if capital flows simply weaken, and the risk
premium demanded by markets rises, investment and GDP could slow significantly.

Authorities’ views
15.
The authorities broadly share the staff’s views on the outlook for 2013 and 2014.
However, there is significant disagreement on the medium term forecasts. The authorities are
confident that Turkey can grow at 4−5 percent in the medium term and yet achieve a meaningful
reduction in the current account deficit, as reflected in their medium-term plan (see Box 2). In their
view, Fund staff underestimates the cyclical component of the current account deficit stemming
from the impact of slow growth in Europe, Turkey’s main trading partner. Excluding gold, they
expect the current account deficit to decline this year despite close to 4 percent growth and view
the exchange rate as close to equilibrium. Thus, in their opinion, Turkey’s external deficit will start
closing as Europe recovers even if Turkey’s economy grows at close to potential. Regarding risks, the
authorities noted that the odds of a market-led adjustment due to weak external financing had
receded considerably after the Federal Reserve announced a delay in tapering. Still, they recognize
that, sooner or later, monetary policy in advanced economies will be normalized, and that Turkey
remains exposed to a reversal in flows. Should one occur, they see the private sector as fully capable
of absorbing the shock and recovering quickly as happened in 2008–09, and don’t believe such a
scenario will lead to any systemic distress. They emphasized that the banks are very well capitalized
and have no open FX position. Although acknowledging that non-financial corporate FX liabilities
have increased, they take comfort in the long maturity, and that the corporates carrying them either
have natural or financial hedges and/or very strong balance sheets. Finally, they pointed out that,
even at the peak of the global financial crisis, rollover rates never dipped much below 100 percent,
particularly for the banks.

POLICY DISCUSSIONS
The policy priority is clear: large imbalances in a less forgiving global environment call for a more
credible monetary anchor and tighter fiscal policy. In the medium term, there is a need to reduce
imbalances and gradually break the link between growth, capital inflows and a large and widening
current account deficit, which has in the past contributed to economic volatility. This will require a
concerted effort to increase national savings and make the economy more competitive.

C. Short Term Policies
C.1 Monetary Policy
16.
Staff argued that the monetary policy stance is not consistent with the inflation target
and needed to be tightened. The top end of the corridor is at 7.75 percent, the main policy rate
(the one-week repo) at 4.5 percent, and the de facto average rate at which the central bank is
providing liquidity at about 6−6½ percent. The recent tightening has translated into some
slowdown in credit growth. Nonetheless, with inflation close to 8 percent, and inflation expectations
for end year above 7 percent, this means that policy rates remain negative in real terms (sharply
negative in the case of the one-week repo). This is hard to justify in an economy that grew at more
than 7 percent annualized in the first half of the year, where credit growth is still running at about
25 percent, and where the 5 percent inflation target is likely to be missed again. Thus, staff called for
a significant tightening above and beyond the recent one, specifically: a one step increase of 250bps
in the main policy rate (the one-week repo) to reach positive real levels, and a systematic provision
of liquidity at this policy rate. In addition, staff argued that the interest rate corridor should be
narrowed. While such a move would be equivalent to about 100–150 bps tightening relative to
current levels, there would be an important signaling effect coming from increasing the actual policy
rate, as opposed to tightening by stealth as is the current practice. Finally, staff argued that foreign
exchange intervention cannot substitute for the right monetary stance, and that it should be limited
to addressing excessive exchange rate volatility.
17.
In addition, staff called for a normalization of the monetary policy framework, which
is too complex and has not delivered targeted inflation.5 The central bank continues to rely on
its unorthodox framework, the key elements of which are: (i) a wide interest rate corridor, 425 basis
points at present; (ii) a highly variable cost of liquidity within this corridor, as the central bank can
suspend its main policy rate (the one week repo) on ad-hoc tightening days and instead provide
liquidity at the higher overnight repo rate; and (iii) the reserve option mechanism (ROM, see Box 3),6
which allows banks to substitute gold and FX for their reserve requirements on TL-denominated
liabilities. In addition, the central bank targets de facto several concurrent objectives on top of its
inflation target, such as financial stability and growth. While the unorthodox policy framework has
been praised by some as highly innovative, in the view of staff the combination of multiple
instruments and objectives has brought about several adverse consequences:


The inflation target has been repeatedly missed: over the last three years, inflation has been
below target in only a few months. Although ignoring financial stability and growth may not be
See Annex III for a summary of the current monetary policy framework.

The ROM gives banks the option to release some of their lira required reserves by depositing foreign exchange or
gold instead. The key is that, if E is the exchange rate, banks have to deposit more than one dollar to release E lira.
Using a conversion rate higher than E allows the central bank to automatically sterilize a proportionally greater part
of the inflows.

the best option for a country constantly buffeted by large capital flows, the Central Bank of the
Republic of Turkey (CBRT) has erred on the side of an insufficient focus on delivering the
inflation target.


Communications with market participants have been hampered: the instruments are complex and
too numerous, and the interaction of these tools makes the framework hard to grasp for market
participants. To its credit, the central bank has significantly ramped up its communication efforts.



The monetary transmission mechanism has been weakened. While the framework gives the
central bank flexibility to adjust rates quickly, the cost of this flexibility is a lower signaled
commitment, a critical aspect to manage expectations. Because of this, changes in effective
lending rates by the central bank are affecting the short end of the yield curve but less so the
long end, where many investment decisions are made. Communication issues only compound
the problem.



The framework has not prevented a significant increase in private sector leverage. One of the
stated goals of having many instruments is to maintain financial stability in addition to price
stability. Yet credit growth in the last three years has exceeded 30 percent on average, and
leverage among households, banks, and non-financial corporates has risen significantly. Finally,
the framework does not seem to have tamed capital inflows (see Box 4).

With this in mind, staff called for a move towards a more orthodox framework, characterized by a
narrower corridor, a consistent provision of liquidity at the main policy rate, and a clearer focus on
inflation. This normalized framework should not ignore financial stability concerns, with interest rate
policy properly complemented with macro and micro-prudential measures.
18.
Staff expressed concerns about whether the reserves accumulated through ROM
provide adequate defense against balance of payments pressures. Since early 2012, the central
bank has accumulated some US$35 billion in gross reserves through ROM. The central bank has
argued that ROM has several distinct advantages over sterilized intervention and indeed in 2012 and
through May 2013, ROM proved useful to partially absorb steady inflows. Moreover, swapping the
FX with the central bank rather than with private banks lowers counterparty risk. However, during
the recent risk episode, the first real test of ROM under stress, the central bank had to resort to
straight interventions using scarce net reserves to alleviate BOP pressures. While ROM reserves
cover banks’ external borrowings, it is clear they do not cover other gaps such as a shortfall of
funding for the current account and hence cannot substitute for net reserves. Hence, should inflows
resume, staff recommended that the central bank boost net reserves through sterilized intervention.

Box 3. CBRT’s Reserve Option Mechanism (ROM)1
In late 2011 the CBRT introduced a new tool, the ROM, into its continuously evolving monetary
framework. The ROM allows commercial banks to meet their reserve requirements on lira-denominated
liabilities by using foreign exchange and gold. Conversion happens at the market exchange rate multiplied
by an increasing penalty parameter, the Reserve Option Coefficient (ROC). Currently, banks can convert up
to 60 percent of their reserve requirements into FX with ROCs ranging from 1.4 to 2.8 and up to 30 percent
into gold with ROCs ranging from 1.4 to 2.5.
The ROM was to help increase the resilience of the economy against external finance shocks and
achieve financial stability by (i) limiting fluctuations in the exchange rate; (ii) limiting conversion of FX
inflows into bank lending; and (iii) incentivizing banks to accumulate FX for “a rainy day.” Existence of the
ROM also helped banks reduce costs of fulfilling regulatory obligations. And being a market-driven facility, it
was to help the CBRT avoid perceptions of the CBRT targeting the exchange rate.
The ROM was designed so that with strong inflows and costs of FX liquidity declining, banks would
voluntarily increase use of the ROM facility, redirecting inflows into the facility while releasing lira and
countering appreciation pressures, while the opposite would happen during outflows. With the effective
ROC greater than 1, the ROM is a more powerful analog to interventions, yet, reflecting decisions of market
participants. Finally, while the ROM has no impact on net international reserves, it does boost gross reserves
even though the ROM-part of reserves is not under the CBRT’s full control.
The ROM indeed worked as expected during inflows, but its existence did not help sufficiently when
inflows weakened in summer of 2013. Release of FX held by the banks in the ROM was limited and did
not prevent exchange rate depreciation, forcing the CBRT to re-introduce the FX sale auctions and to tighten
TL liquidity. This happened because outflows were not driven by banks’ repayments of their outstanding
loans, but by outflows from money, government debt, and equity markets. Under these circumstances, it
would not have been rational for banks to sell FX stored in the ROM, as expectations for increases in the
costs of TL liquidity and/or nominal depreciation must have been in place, indeed vindicated by subsequent
developments. Additionally, sales of FX stored in the ROM, would have opened a short FX position for banks,
something restricted by regulations.
Overall, the ROM has certain limitations. Most importantly, as noted above, it is not a perfect substitute
for net international reserves when it comes to the economy’s BOP needs. Also, in times of heightened
pressures, an increase in the costs of TL liquidity is likely to limit release of FX. Finally, communicating the
purpose and mechanics of the ROM to market participants has proved challenging.

Box 4. Capital Flows and the Exchange Market Pressure Index1
The issue of push and pull factors behind volatile capital flows has been a source of debate in Turkey.
The CBRT adopted in late 2010 a new monetary framework, in part to mitigate the impact of these flows.
Examining the Turkish experience using the Exchange Market Pressure Index (EMP)—which identifies the
factors driving the flows and allows a cross-country comparison with other emerging economies—helps
assess the impact the new framework may have had on the flows.

Empirical analysis suggests that factors that affect the EMP are: 1) changes in the Turkey-specific risk
perceptions, measured by lagged changes in Turkey’s CDS spreads, and 2) global conditions measured either
by the global volatility index (VIX) or the monetary policy stance of the advanced economies. Specifications
with these factors can explain 30–40 percent of movements in the EMP. Surprisingly, there was no statistical
evidence of a direct impact of unconventional global monetary policies on Turkey, only of an indirect channel,
via global volatility.
More importantly, no evidence of an impact of the CBRT’s unorthodox framework was found.
Estimations using rolling samples suggest no
statistically significant changes in the parameters,
raising the question of whether the new framework
adopted by the CBRT is more effective than a
conventional framework at mitigating inflows.
Comparisons with other emerging economies
suggest that exchange market pressures in Turkey
are to a degree larger than in other countries
linked to global and country-specific risk factors,
including a noticeably stronger link to interest rates
in advanced economies.

Authorities’ views
19.
The central bank believes the current monetary stance is appropriate. They noted that,
although domestic demand grew rapidly in the first two quarters, this came after six quarters of
close to zero cumulative growth. Thus, the underlying pace of activity should not be exaggerated,
especially given that they still believe there is a negative output gap. In this context, they see their
recent interest rate increases as sufficient to bring inflation down to target, pointing to slowing
credit growth on a sequential basis, and that financial conditions show a significant tightening.
Regarding its framework, the central bank firmly believes that it is superior to a more orthodox
inflation targeting one, since in a global economy characterized by large and volatile capital flows,
rigid adherence to an inflation target could come into conflict with financial stability. Therefore, they
see their framework as consistent with a “flexible inflation targeting” regime that balances other
objectives. Moreover, the authorities place great value in the interest rate flexibility afforded by the
combination of a wide corridor and the ability to shift within the corridor. In their view, the standard
frameworks suffer from significant rate inertia that is not adapted to a volatile world. They agreed
with staff that fundamentals should set the level of the exchange rate, but believe the Turkish lira is
close to equilibrium. Finally, they concur that ROM cannot cover all balance of payment shortfalls,
and agreed that regular interventions had been needed to provide liquidity to the market as a result
of weaker BOP financing. Still, they believe the benefits of ROM should not be underplayed, notably
its role in ensuring that banks have sufficient liquid FX buffers should roll-over pressures materialize.
They added that they are accumulating net reserves via the export/import bank.

C.2 Fiscal Policy
20.
The authorities are on track to meet their 2013 budget targets, despite rapid spending
growth. The budget contemplates a central government primary surplus of 0.5 percent of GDP, very
close to last year’s outturn, and the performance to August is consistent with this target. This,
however, masks an expansionary fiscal stance as expenditures are growing well above nominal GDP
on the back of revenues boosted by one-off factors. Nominal central government revenues grew
17 percent y-o-y in the year to August, compared with 9 percent growth last year. Privatization
revenues and repayments of tax arrears by public companies have already exceeded the full year
targets.7 The government has then made use of these windfalls to increase capital spending beyond
the budget ceiling. As a result, primary spending grew by 15 percent in the year to August, versus a
full year target of 11 percent in the budget.
21.
Thus, staff argued that fiscal policy is too loose. The ½ percent of GDP deterioration of
the structural primary balance expected for this year, together with high nominal spending growth,

7

Privatization revenues are below the line and not accounted in the fiscal balances quoted above. However, in
Turkey the law allows for excess privatization revenues to be spent freely and hence they are financing sources for
additional spending.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

15

TURKEY

is indicative of an expansionary stance.8 Current levels of spending growth are too high for an
economy that expanded at more than 7 percent annualized in the first half of the year, where
inflation is at 8 percent, and where the current account deficit is high. Hence, staff advised that, the
authorities contain expenditure in the last four months of the year to avoid any further overruns,
and that any additional one-off revenues be saved rather than used to add to primary spending.
22.
Looking into 2014, staff recommended a significant fiscal tightening. Specifically, staff
recommended that next year’s central government budget target a 22 percent of GDP expenditure
ratio as contemplated in the 2013–15 medium-term plan, and that any revenue over-performance
be saved. Such actions would be consistent with a structural tightening of ¾ percent of GDP
compared to the baseline. This is appropriate given the very high current account deficit, associated
vulnerabilities, and would relieve pressure from monetary policy. However, even this modest
structural improvement will be challenging given rapidly growing non-discretionary primary
spending, whose share in total spending has increased from 47 percent before the crisis to almost
60 percent now. Thus, staff recommended that the fiscal effort focus on containing primary
discretionary expenditure growth, notably current spending.9
23.
Discretionary fiscal stimulus should be reserved for scenarios where growth is
expected to turn negative. In the view of staff, given the large current account deficit, and with
inflation well above target, there would be little justification to respond with more than the
automatic stabilizers to a moderate slowdown in growth. Thus, staff advised that discretionary fiscal
policy should not be used to ensure a high “floor” for growth. However, given low public deficits and
debt (see debt sustainability analysis), there would be room for discretionary stimulus if growth were
projected to turn negative. This policy was adopted by the authorities during 2008–09.

Authorities’ views
24.
The authorities believe that the 2013 budget headline targets will be met or exceeded,
but recognize that there will be expenditure over-runs. Regarding next year, they agreed with
the need to respect the primary surplus target set out in the 2013–15 medium term plan. They also
share the view that this needs to be achieved primarily via expenditure restraint. Although they see
less scope for adjustment at the central government than recommended by staff, they expect some
room for gains outside of the central government. Regarding the increase of non-discretionary
primary spending, they believe staff should acknowledge that this was allowed for by a permanent
decline in debt service costs, thanks to the significant fiscal efforts of the past decade. In addition,
some of the large increase in the wage bill reflects the hiring of additional
8

Staff’s measures of the structural fiscal balance suggest a positive fiscal impulse in 2013. However, due to
uncertainty over the output gap and structural revenues, this measure is complemented with a spending growth
indicator.
9

Given potential growth of around 4 percent and the central bank’s inflation target of 5 percent, nominal spending
growth of around 9 percent would be about “neutral” in the sense of being in line with nominal potential growth and
would be consistent with the primary surplus target advocated by staff.

teachers, in line with their objectives to reform the education system and increase educational
attainment.
C.3 Financial and Macro-prudential Policies
25.
Banks continue to perform well. Non-performing loan ratios remain low at about
3 percent, although NPLs are slightly higher in more recent loan vintages. Including loans that were
restructured before becoming non-performing, the ratio of “problem” loans reaches around
2.84 percent of total loans. With asset quality good, bank profitability was strong in the first half of
the year. Even with the recent tightening of monetary policy net interest margins remain at
4 percent, and return on equity close to 17 percent.
26.
Banks’ indirect exposure to FX risk has risen rapidly, but prudential regulations provide
some comfort. The banks’ own on-balance sheet open FX position is not very large, at slightly below
US$20 billion or 2½ percent of GDP, and is hedged off-balance sheet through swaps. However, the
indirect FX risk is a growing concern, as lending in foreign exchange to non-financial corporates has
increased to some US$130 billion from about US$40 billion in mid-2008 (see Box 5). However,
regulations stipulate that FX loans can only be given to companies that can show export receipts, or
else be of a minimum US$5 million and at least 1–year maturity. These regulations are aimed to
minimize rollover risks, to benefit larger corporates with greater access to financial hedging, and to
increase incentives for banks to do proper risk assessment. At present, large corporations account for
84 percent of total FX loans by banks, and the loans are not unduly concentrated in any one sector:
the energy sector accounts for 15 percent of the total, and no other sector accounts for more than
10 percent. Still, some US$25 billion in FX indexed loans is not subject to the same regulations, even
though it carries similar risks.
27.
In addition, capital and liquidity ratios appear sufficient to cope with shocks. The capital
adequacy ratio of the system is now at 16 percent (Basel 2.5 definition), still high despite recent
marked-to-market losses on the banks’ securities portfolios and the impact of a weaker lira on
risk-weighted assets. Moreover, capital is almost entirely tier 1. Similarly, the banks’ liquidity
adequacy ratios (either at one week or one month maturity, total or FX only) show liquid assets cover
more than 100 percent of short term liabilities despite conservative assumptions on the amount of
deposits “at risk of flight.” Recent stress tests by the regulators show that, even under large GDP
shocks, the system’s CAR would remain above 12 percent, with no bank falling under 8 percent. The
models used by the regulator could be further elaborated, in particular focusing on the transmission
from GDP shocks into unemployment, credit growth, and the exchange rate, and from there to NPLs.
Staff recommended additional calibration of the macro and satellite models regarding
unemployment and exchange rate movements.

Box 5. Foreign Exchange Exposure in the Non-Financial Corporate Sector
Recently, attention has focused on the foreign exchange position of Turkey’s non-financial corporate
sector. Non-financial corporations have substantial foreign exchange (FX) liabilities. As of June 2013, these
liabilities stand at US$251 billion, compared to US$87 billion of FX assets, and hence a US$164 billion net
position. Since mid 2008, when the net position was US$78 billion, corporate FX liabilities have increased by
some 50 percent, while FX assets decreased slightly (Figure). Exports, which are often mentioned in relation
to FX liabilities, increased by 17 percent in US dollar terms over the same time period.

shift can be noted in corporate FX assets: While total corporate FX deposits have remained almost flat at
around US$60 billion, the share of these deposits held in the domestic banking system has increased to
two-thirds of this total, up from some 42 percent in 2008.
This way, risks have transferred to the domestic banking system, and careful monitoring seems
warranted. While some of these corporate are hedged – indirectly through export earnings potential or
directly using financial hedges,—aggregate data on such hedges is not readily available. Similarly, aggregate
information on corporates’ FX collateral is not on hand. These data gaps need to be filled to ensure proper
regulatory insight into the risks associated with corporate FX exposure at the aggregate level.

28.
Staff is of the view that the macro-prudential tool kit could be used in a more targeted
and clear manner for financial stability.10 Given that the short FX position of the non-financial
corporates constitutes an important vulnerability for the banks, the authorities should consider
raising risk weights and provisioning on such loans as was also recommended in the 2012 Financial
System Stability Assessment (FSSA). Also, while supervisors have access to data on export receipts,
financial hedges, or FX collateral underpinning any single FX loan, the data on these hedges and
collateral should be at a minimum aggregated and ideally be made public. Moreover, staff
recommended that FX indexed lending be subject to the same prudential measures as FX lending.
Separately, while households are not very leveraged relative to peers, debt-to-income ratios have
grown rapidly in recent years, and are set to increase even further given the current pace of credit
growth. In that context, staff welcomed the measure to link clients’ income to credit card limits in line
10

See Annex IV for a summary of recent macro-prudential measures.

18

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

TURKEY

with recommendations from the FSSA. This could be extended to general purpose loans too. Beyond
this, a more general consumer debt-to-income limit would be a welcome step. While currently banks
use such limits for their internal risk management, the limits are not uniform across banks and
cannot be enforced until they are made into a prudential requirement.
29.
Staff argued that macro-prudential policies should not be used to stimulate specific
credit segments, absent microeconomic distortions. The authorities have recently eliminated
loan-to-value ratios for commercial real estate loans. They are also considering changes in
micro- prudential regulation for export loans and SMEs. In staff’s view, the main role of
macro-prudential instruments should be to guarantee financial stability. Thus, absent microeconomic
distortions that affect the supply of credit to specific sectors, their use to redirect credit in the
economy is not warranted. More generally, staff cautioned that macro-prudential policies should not
be a substitute for the proper monetary and fiscal stance.
30.
The mission reiterated the importance of addressing deficiencies identified by the
Financial Action Task Force (FATF) and the FSSA in Turkey’s combating the financing of
terrorism (CFT) framework. Turkey is still included on the FATF list of jurisdictions that have not
made sufficient progress to address strategic deficiencies in their AML/CFT frameworks, which is
leading to heightened due diligence from foreign financial institutions regarding transactions with
Turkey. Turkey strengthened its CFT legal framework earlier this year, but the FATF considers that
certain concerns nevertheless remain, and these concerns need to be addressed in order to protect
Turkey’s financial sector.

Authorities’ views
31.
The authorities believe the regulatory framework is adequate to contain risks. Although
they agree that indirect FX risk has increased in recent years, they emphasized prudential regulations
that place limits on banks’ FX lending. In addition, they are monitoring FX mismatches closely, not
least through on site supervisions and a more comprehensive collection of data. Regarding macro
and micro prudential measures, they stated that the new regulation linking income to credit card
limits is another significant step to contain excessive leverage, and that they will consider extending
these limits to other kinds of consumer loans. Unlike staff, they believe that prudential regulation is
an important tool to rebalance the economy while not endangering financial stability. In that context,
they see scope for some modest changes in prudential regulation to incentivize export and SME
loans.

D. Medium Term Policies
32.
Turkey needs to raise its savings rate to escape boom-bust cycles. The national saving
rate has fallen dramatically over the last fifteen years as improved macroeconomic conditions
reduced the need for precautionary savings, while a cleaned up banking system was able to rapidly
expand credit. With the savings rate at a low of 15 percent of GDP, the investment rate is determined
INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

19

TURKEY

by the availability of volatile external flows. When these are ample, investment, and consumption
expand rapidly. When capital flows contract, they drag the economy down with them. The correlation
between GDP growth and capital flows in Turkey is about 80 percent, much higher than in peer
countries. With capital flows so volatile, particularly the short term flows that Turkey attracts, output
volatility has been high.
33.
Without higher savings, Turkey will find it hard to sustain historical trend growth in the
future. Turkey’s trend growth rate has been remarkably stable at around 4 percent, despite
significant output volatility around this trend. Yet this growth rate has not necessarily been
consistent with external stability. In fact, staff estimates show that, given current savings and the
structure of the economy, the rate of growth consistent with a stable current account is around
2¾−3½ percent (see Box 6).11 Therefore, Turkey can grow sustainably at 4 percent or above only if it
manages to raise domestic savings. Otherwise, such growth rates would come at the cost of
widening current account deficits (from an already high level), with all the risks attached to them.12
34.
Staff argued that fiscal policy has a major role to play in raising national savings. The
authorities have commendably undertaken a reform of the private pension system, which is proving
effective in bringing new people into the savings net. Yet these gains will not be enough given the
large savings gap, hence fiscal policy should also play a role.13 In addition, a tighter fiscal policy
would relieve pressure on monetary policy, and contribute to a needed depreciation of the real
exchange rate. Thus, staff recommended that the government target a primary surplus of around
2 percent of GDP in the medium term, which would be akin to targeting a 1 percent of GDP
structural primary surplus by 2018, about 2 percent more than under the current policies baseline. To
initiate the adjustment, staff proposed that the 2014 MTP (which covers the period 2014–16) target a
central government primary balance of 1.2 percent of GDP by 2016 (consistent with an increase in
the structural primary balance relative to baseline of 1.1 of GDP over three years). Staff welcomed the
recently adopted development plan for 2014–18 which contemplates a 1 percent of GDP primary
balance in the medium term, although more is needed.

11

Average growth of 4 percent over the last fifteen years has been associated with a trend deterioration in the current
account of about 7 percentage points of GDP.

12

Turkey was able to grow at 4 percent per year on average in the past because it started with a low current account
deficit and a low stock of external liabilities. Now, with much higher external liabilities and current account deficit, the
external financing constraint is more likely to become binding.
13

The Ricardian offset coefficient is estimated to be around 0.5 in Turkey. The government has recently undertaken
other measures to boost savings, such as the reform of the private pension system. See the 2012 Article IV Staff
Report for details on this reform.

Low domestic savings, and policy pro-cyclicality, are key reasons behind this volatility. Turkey has a
low national savings rate, hence at the margin investment is financed by foreign flows: when these are
ample, investment and the current account deficit expand, and when flows recede so does investment,
dragging the economy with it. The correlation between GDP growth and capital flows in Turkey is 0.8, much
higher than in peer countries. In addition, flows into Turkey have been more volatile than elsewhere, because
Turkey attracts relatively little FDI and more short-term flows. Beyond the low savings-volatile flows nexus,
fiscal policy has been pro-cyclical in Turkey, exacerbating the effect of capital flows.

Given the high current account deficit, it is important to estimate the highest rate of growth
consistent with no deterioration in this deficit. Formal regressions show that: (i) growth is the main
correlate of the current account, more so than other variables like oil prices; (ii) the highest growth rate
consistent with no deterioration in the current account deficit is in the 2¾−3½ percent range; and (iii) every
year that growth exceeds this ± 3 percent speed limit by one percentage point, the current account
deteriorates by 0.3−0.4 percent of GDP. Thus, were the economy to grow consistently at the consensus
potential rate, the current account deficit would gradually deteriorate from its already high level.

35.
Tighter monetary and fiscal policies, as recommended by staff, would deliver a
reduction in imbalances. While a tighter monetary stance and fiscal adjustment as recommended
above could have costs in terms of growth, the current account deficit and associated external
financing needs would also be lower and on a declining trend (see text table for details). In the active
scenario, the current account deficit could be reduced by 2¾ percent of GDP by the end of the
projection period relative to the baseline; gross financing needs could be some 6 percent of GDP
lower, too. In turn, the reduction in the external imbalance, coupled with a commitment to strong
policies, could materially reduce the probability of an abrupt, market-led adjustment. Staff argued
that the gains from slightly slower growth but with less risk of a sudden stop (which would produce a
sharp growth slowdown) would far outweigh the costs. Structural reforms could complement macro
policies, helping to boost growth in the outer years.

1/ The active scenario is predicated on a 2 percent of GDP structural fiscal adjustment spread over five years, and an immediate (i.e., Jan 2014
for the purpose of the scenario) monetary tightening equivalent to 150 basis points. The fundamental assumptions are: (i) the fiscal multiplier
is 1; (ii) the impact of a 100 basis points monetary tightening is a contraction of 0.6 percent of GDP at peak, dissipating after two years;
(iii) a 1 percentage point reduction in growth is associated with a reduction in the current account deficit of 0.4 percent of GDP; (iv) the

To increase public savings, budget rigidities must be addressed (see Box 7). Even
though interest spending has declined by more than 2 percent of GDP relative to the 2005–07
average, total spending has increased by some ¾ percentage points of GDP because of
non-discretionary primary spending items such as salaries and pensions. The rising spending,
however, has not led to deterioration in the fiscal balance as revenues, largely dependent on
consumption and import taxes, have compensated spending increases. Nevertheless,
non-discretionary primary spending items now account for close to 60 percent of total spending
compared to 47 percent five years ago. In staff’s view, the creep up of non-discretionary primary
spending has brought about several undesirable consequences: (i) it has squeezed investment
spending, which at least until this year has remained below 3 percent of GDP, not enough given the
country’s infrastructure needs; (ii) it will render even a 2 percent consolidation spread over five years
difficult (though not unrealistically so), as such a consolidation would require very low nominal
growth in discretionary spending, and in particular personnel costs; and (iii) it will limit the room for
fiscal policy to respond quickly to shocks, exacerbated by the fact that 75 percent of central
government revenues are directly linked to domestic demand and import growth.
37.
Beyond low savings, Turkey has a broader competitiveness challenge (see Box 8) that
requires action on the structural front. In addition to the estimated current account gap and real
effective exchange rate overvaluation, low inward FDI flows relative to peers, limited export
sophistication (about 75 percent of exports are concentrated in agriculture and low- and
medium-tech manufacturing), and fast wage growth are among the indicators that point to a
competitiveness challenge. The government has put in place various measures to address this gap,
such as last year’s package of investment incentives to help companies move into advanced
technology sectors and lower the import content of production. It is too early to gauge the success
of the plan, but whatever its success more will be needed on various fronts to address Turkey’s
competitiveness gap:


Attracting FDI: Turkey’s FDI stock, at slightly more than 20 percent of GDP, is one of the
lowest among emerging market peers. This is disappointing considering the potential offered
by the country’s location, as well as its large and growing domestic market and favorable
demographics. Low FDI not only limits transfer of know-how, it also means that external
imbalances are financed with less stable sources of funds contributing to the boom-bust
pattern of growth. While the new commercial code introduced in 2012 is widely thought to
represent major progress, foreign investors often complain of a slow and inconsistent
judiciary, cumbersome licensing and regulations, and a costly tax policy and administration.
High wage costs also are a problem.



Reducing energy dependence: historically, more than two thirds of the country’s current
account deficit has been accounted for by the net energy import bill. The authorities’ have
undertaken large-scale privatizations of the energy distribution system, are encouraging
expansions of renewables, and have signed a tender for a second nuclear plant as part of an
ambitious agenda to limit energy dependence. However, these gains will only be felt in the
medium-term.

Box 7. Budget Rigidities in Turkey1
Turkey’s fiscal effort over the last ten years brought about an impressive reduction in debt and
interest costs. However, in recent years the share of non-discretional primary spending has grown too
rapidly. Unaddressed, it could become a source of concern from a macroeconomic and budgetary
perspective. In the medium-term, fiscal policy should play a significant role in aggregate demand
management and contribute to higher and
stable national savings. For such purposes, the
budget should remain flexible to be able to
accommodate potential shocks.

the share of interest payments in total spending was cut by half, non-discretional spending quickly

similar path.

observed in recent years, spending ceilings have been systematically exceeded during the whole
period.
Key features of the MTP do not facilitate compliance with spending ceilings. The MTP remains
focused on the annual budget process, with little emphasis given to its medium-term component. In
particular, spending ceilings for the outer years are not binding and are updated every year,
systematically allowing for spending levels to accommodate past deviations. This practice creates a
built-in bias towards

higher spending and therefore reduces the government’s capacity to comply with spending ceilings,
ultimately putting at risk fiscal discipline.
Given current budget rigidities, achieving spending priorities set in the MTP may prove
challenging. While overall Turkey has managed to meet overall balance targets in the past, the
consequences of spending rigidities for fiscal discipline are far reaching. A comprehensive solution
would require a combination of spending rationalization and improvement in current public financial
management practices. Based on international best practice, options regarding the latter include:
(i) gradually move to a more binding medium-term spending ceilings; (ii) introduce mechanism to
adjust for past deviations; (iii) save over-performance in revenues; and (iv) report a detailed
reconciliation between budget realizations and MTP spending.



Efforts to address the large informal sector have had some success in recent years and
need to be sustained. According to some estimates, the informal sector now accounts for a
quarter of GDP, some 7 percentage points lower than ten years ago. This is good progress,
but the informal sector remains large and there is evidence that firms in this sector are more
liquidity constrained, invest less, and have a harder time growing. Current plans to double
the number of tax inspectors are welcome. In this context, the proposed PIT/CIT reform is a
step in the right direction, although further rationalization of the tax structure could increase
incentives for formal labor market participation14.



The labor market needs to become more attuned to economic conditions: the national
employment strategy aims to address obstacles to the use of part-time and temporary labor
in the formal market (which will also help increase female participation rates), in particular
the high cost of pension and severance premia relative to part time wages. These reforms go
in the right direction.

Authorities’ views
38.
The authorities are well aware of the competitiveness challenge. Nonetheless, they
believe that staff underestimates Turkey’s capacity to adjust and maintain high growth rates while
reducing external imbalances. In their view, staff’s estimates of the growth rate consistent with no
deterioration of the external balance over-emphasize the role of growth in the trend deterioration of
the current account over the last ten years. Related to this, they gauge Turkey’s competitiveness gap
to be smaller than in the staff’s estimates, with the current account deficit about 1 percent above its
sustainable norm, and the real exchange rate close to equilibrium. Nonetheless, they remain
14

The proposed CIT/PIT reform aims at simplifying and harmonizing income taxation. The purpose is to ensure that
different types of income are subjected to similar tax rates, while improving the progressivity of the system. The
income tax base will be broadened by reducing exceptions. Overall, the authorities expect that the reform will have a
positive fiscal impact on revenue collections.

committed to tackling Turkey’s low savings problem, pointing to the fact that the reform of the
private pension scheme had attracted a considerable number of new entrants. In addition, the 10th
National Development Plan provides tangible proof of their commitment to reducing energy
dependence, increasing labor force participation and labor market flexibility, and reducing
informality.
Box 8. Turkey’s External Competitiveness1
In 2012, Turkey achieved a welcome reduction in external imbalances, thanks in large part to
export diversification to the MENA region and strong gold exports. The trade diversification
resulted in a growth of Turkey’s export share to the MENA region of 37 percent. Penetration into
traditional EU markets has remained constant, allowing for an overall growth in world market share of
12 percent. At 6.1 percent of GDP however, the current account deficit remained high, and is now
expected to widen again to 7.4 percent of GDP in 2013 due to stronger domestic demand and gold
re-stocking. On trend, Turkey has been running a current account deficit since 2002, with an average
deficit of 4.7 percent of GDP.
Real effective exchange rates, based on consumer and producer prices, rose by 8 and 5 percent,
respectively, in 2012 and have remained relatively constant in the first half of 2013. The nominal
exchange rate against the euro-dollar basket was relatively flat in 2012, and has been on a depreciating
trend since the second quarter of 2013.
The IMF’s 2013 External Balance Assessment (EBA), which relies on end-2012 outturns, shows that
Turkey’s current account deficit is 4 percentage points of GDP higher than levels suggested by
fundamentals (e.g., demographic factors and level of economic development) and desirable policy
settings. On this basis, assessments of the real effective exchange rate (REER) show an overvaluation of
20-30 percent. However, the EBA model in which only 0.7 percentage point of the current account gap
is explained by the specified policy variables, delivers a poor fit for Turkey.
A 10-20 percent overvaluation of the REER— based on a current account gap in the range of
1½– 3 percentage points of GDP —is likely a more appropriate estimate. This gap reflects the
improvement in the 2012 current account balance vis-à-vis the 2011 outturn, and is in line with the
assessment contained in the 2011 Article IV Consultation Staff Report. Moreover, in the context of
strong capital inflows up until the first half of 2013, an improving share of exports in GDP, and a stable
share of FDI into the tradable industrial sector, it is possible that standard REER assessments may
overstate the extent of the overvaluation. Still, Turkey’s current account deficit continues to be weaker
than the estimated norm, and the trend thus far in 2013 does not point to any improvement.
The real exchange rate overvaluation is driven by positive inflation differentials with trading
partners and trade competitors. In particular, the recent nominal exchange rate depreciation has not
been enough to offset domestic price increases. This has encouraged imports while hurting the
competitiveness of Turkish exports, around 1/3 of which are price-sensitive primary and low-technology
products. The high relative
______________________________________

TURKEY

Box 8. Turkey’s External Competitiveness (concluded)
inflation also feeds into the country’s wage dynamics, creating nominal and real wage rigidities, which in turn
feed back into broader price developments.
FDI continues to make up only a small part of total capital flows into Turkey, and presents another view
on Turkey’s competitiveness challenges. In 2012, an FDI flow of 1.6 percent of GDP was below the average of
2.2 percent of GDP for G-20 emerging-market peers. There has been an improvement in the composition of
FDI, with the share in tradable sectors increasing to 55 percent of total in 2012 from 50 percent in the previous
year. Still, greater effort is needed to attract more FDI, and firmly tilt it towards the tradable sector. The
country’s volatile economy, dependence on imports, and overvalued exchange rate likely weigh on its
attractiveness as an investment destination. But cross-country comparisons suggest that other structural
bottlenecks may also be at play. According to the 2013 Global Competitiveness Report, Turkey continues to
rank poorly in terms of labor market efficiency and quality of education. The World Bank’s Doing Business
Report also point to the high cost of starting a business as a potential constraint.
Shifts in global conditions highlight the importance of reforms to raise Turkey’s competitiveness. The
large capital flows into emerging markets in recent years may slow significantly in the period ahead. At the
same time, improving economic conditions in Turkey’s trading partners also point to better prospects for
exports. These conditions underscore the need to raise domestic savings while boosting exports’ short-term
price competitiveness. Public savings must contribute as much as possible. Over the medium term, steady rises
in real per capita income will hinge on sustained productivity gains, notably by increasing the technical capacity
of its workforce, encouraging investment, and improving the functioning of labor markets. The recent
investment incentive scheme and education reform show that the Turkish authorities are aware of these issues.
Such policies will help close the competitiveness gap by improving the overall productivity of the country,
moving Turkish products up the value chain, and reducing the reliance on imports.

STAFF APPRAISAL
39.
The authorities’ policies delivered a welcome rebalancing in 2012 while maintaining
low unemployment. This set the stage for the acceleration of economic activity in 2013. The
rebound, led by private consumption and public investment, was driven by the policy stimuli since
the second half of 2012. Unemployment stayed low, while household balance sheets remained
relatively healthy, as leverage increased from a low base. With domestic demand gathering strength,
full year growth is expected to come in at 3.8 percent. Under current macroeconomic policies, next
year’s growth is forecast at 3½ percent.
40.
The domestic demand-led recovery is exerting upward pressures on the current
account deficit and inflation. The current account deficit is projected to widen to above 7 percent
of GDP this year, in part on account of an increase in gold imports, and is likely to stay close to that
level next year. Inflation trends and the currency depreciation are likely to result in inflation again
above the central bank’s target of 5 percent both this and next year.
41.
The authorities’ immediate priority should be to reduce imbalances. The market
reappraisal of advanced economies’ monetary policies has exposed Turkey’s main vulnerability—its
sizable external imbalance. While the timing and magnitude of the normalization of interest rates is
uncertain, the recent portfolio rebalancing has led to a re-pricing of Turkish assets and caused lira
depreciation. In this context and with gross external financing needs projected to remain high over
the next few years, a weakening or a reversal of capital flows presents a major challenge for the
Turkish economy. Therefore, policies need to focus on mitigation of these risks.
42.
The monetary stance needs to be tightened to be consistent with the inflation target.
High credit growth, inflation (both headline and core) well above the end-year target of 5 percent,
and the high and widening current account deficit, all warrant positive real policy rates, in particular
the one week repo rate. Without this, it would be hard to bring inflation and expectations in line with
the authorities’ target, and to establish a strong nominal anchor.
43.
The CBRT should re-consider its monetary policy framework. Ultimately the success of a
monetary policy framework is tied to its ability to achieve the inflation target and anchor
expectations. The current framework might not be helping to deliver the authorities’ inflation target
and may have weakened the monetary transmission mechanism. It is complex and has too many
objectives. With a more unforgiving external environment, the framework is increasingly questioned
by markets and complicates the communication of policies. Normalizing the framework would boost
policy credibility and simplify communication.
44.
The authorities should use sales of foreign exchange reserves only to address excessive
volatility, as foreign exchange rate interventions cannot substitute for the right monetary stance.
This would preserve limited net foreign exchange reserves, which should be increased through
sterilized intervention if inflows resume.

28

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

TURKEY

45.
The authorities are on track to meet the fiscal targets for 2013, but the fiscal stance is
expansionary and should be reined in. Revenue performance year-to-date has been strong, with
some help from one-off effects. As a result, the authorities are broadly on track to meet their 2013
budget deficit target, further reducing public debt from already modest levels. However, buoyant
revenues have allowed large nominal expenditure increases. Therefore, the government will exceed
the approved 2013 budget expenditure ceilings, notably due to investment spending.
46.
Fiscal policy has a critical role to play in reducing external vulnerabilities. Thus, the 2014
budget should target the primary spending levels set by the government in the 2013–15
medium-term fiscal plan and save any revenue over-performance. Such a policy objective—which
implies a 0.7 percent of GDP improvement of the structural deficit—would make a critical
contribution to the envisaged gradual reduction of Turkey’s macroeconomic imbalances and
reassure markets that fiscal discipline is intact.
47.
It will also be important to revisit the structure of the budget to prevent it from
becoming more rigid. Non-discretionary primary spending has been allowed to grow to more than
half of total expenditure, which limits the ability of the authorities to target spending to priority
areas, especially as this change over time. In particular, containing current expenditure would
increase room for public investment. At the same time, it would increase flexibility and buffers in the
budget, enabling fiscal policy to better respond if unexpected adverse shocks were to occur. The
welcome ongoing efforts to broaden the tax base and improve tax administration will further
enhance the structure and resilience of the budget.
48.
The Turkish financial system continues to perform well, although risks remain. Banks’
leverage and the level of non-performing loans are low relative to peers; the capital adequacy ratios
remain high; loans are largely funded by deposits; and their open FX positions are not large.
Still, risks are being taken in this period of rapid credit expansion, and so continued careful
monitoring is needed. In particular, more attention to FX credit to corporate clients is warranted, as
FX-induced liquidity or solvency problems in the corporate sector can quickly lead to rising
non_performing loans. On the other side of the banks’ balance sheets, keeping an eye on the
amounts and structure of FX funding of the sector remains important, especially given the current
external environment.
49.
Prudential policies should be targeted at the household credit and corporate FX
lending segments. Data gaps with respect to all aspects of FX lending to the non-financial
corporate sector need to be addressed. Increasing risk weights or reserve requirements for such
loans could be considered. Prudential regulations on FX-indexed lending should be brought in line
with regulation of FX loans. In the rapidly growing household credit segment, the authorities’
measure to link clients’ credit cards exposure limits to income is welcome and could be helpfully
extended to general purpose consumer loans. Meanwhile, in the absence of microeconomic
distortions, use of prudential policies to stimulate credit to specific sectors is not warranted.
INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

TURKEY

50.
In the medium-term, the challenge is to boost growth without increasing imbalances.
Turkey’s demographic structure, strategic geographical location, and dynamic economy present
many opportunities. However, it will be difficult for Turkey to sustain an average growth of 4 to
5 percent per year while continuing to accumulate large external liabilities year after year. The
present low level of domestic savings implies that investment is determined by the availability of
volatile external inflows. Without structural reforms, growth would have to be below the historical
trend to avoid increases in external imbalances and accompanying bouts of instability.
51.
The authorities have correctly identified the need to increase domestic savings. Last
year’s private sector pension reform has started to bear some results and is a positive initial step.
However, the public sector must also lead the way with a sizeable contribution to raise savings. In
that sense, the 1¼ percent of GDP increase in public savings envisioned in the 10th development
plan is commendable. Nevertheless, the authorities are encouraged to target over the medium-term
a more ambitious primary surplus in line with the levels observed before the onset of the global
financial crisis.
52.
Structural reform should further boost competitiveness and growth. The Turkish private
sector has demonstrated an ability to adapt to shocks. Further improvements in the business climate
could enhance this resilience further and would attract more foreign direct investment—a stable
source of external funding. Increasing educational outcomes to boost productivity should be
another priority. Reducing energy dependence further—in line with government policies and recent
reforms—would help decrease the energy import bill, which represents a significant part of Turkey’s
trade deficit. Efforts to address the large informal sector have met with some success and need to be
sustained. Lastly, reforms to improve the functioning of the labor market could boost productivity
and employment.
53.
It is recommended that the next Article IV Consultation with Turkey be held on the
standard 12-month cycle.

ANNEX I: PUBLIC DEBT SUSTAINABILITYANNEX I:
PUBLIC DEBT SUSTAINABILITY
At close to 35 percent of GDP, Turkey’s public debt ratio is well below its historical ten-year average.
Gross financing needs are slightly above 10 percent of GDP, and are expected to rise to around 11
percent of GDP over the medium term. The DSA suggests that Turkey’s government debt is sustainable
even under different shock scenarios. Given the debt structure (average maturity of 5 years and
60 percent of total debt at fixed interest rates) the direct interest pass-through to the budget is
relatively slow. Only the impact of lower GDP growth rates represents a significant threat to debt
dynamic. While all public debt profile indicators are below early warning benchmarks, the high external
financing requirements point to risks arising from the external debt position.
Baseline and Realism of Projections15


Debt-levels. Turkey’s favorable debt dynamics are underpinned by a primary surplus and trend
GDP growth above the real interest rate. A higher fiscal effort in 2012 than projected a year ago,
along with higher privatization proceeds and the impact of higher growth, are forecast to push
down the debt-to-GDP ratio relative to previous estimates. Staff forecast that the former will
continue its declining path from already moderate levels reaching 31.6 percent in 2018—down
by 8.4pp since end-2008. Staff projects that gross financing needs will be 10.4 percent of GDP
in 2013—down from 19.7 percent on average for 2002–2010—and will reach 11.4 percent at the
end of the projection period.



Growth. Past projections of growth outcomes show high forecast errors, possibly due to high
volatility of GDP in Turkey, but don’t seem to have a systematic bias that undermine the
assessment of sustainability. The current growth projections are slightly above those of one year
ago, yielding a positive impact in reducing the level of debt. In the medium term, the output gap
is expected to close after a being slightly negative in the next two years. Nonetheless, Turkey’s
debt is highly sensitive to big swings in GDP growth, highlighting the relevance of growth shocks
in the stress tests.



Sovereign yields. Despite the volatility observed in recent months, Turkey’ yields on public
sector debt have returned to historical values at around 9.0 percent. The spreads against the US
bonds in the last three months remained on average at 213 bps, close to trend but higher than
its lowest value of 118 bps observed in May 2013. The effective interest rate is forecast to rise
from 9.8 percent in 2012 to 10.3 percent in 2013, returning to 2012 values at the end of the
forecast period.

15

The new DSA framework is described in (http://www.imf.org/external/np/pp/eng/2013/050913.pdf).

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

TURKEY



Fiscal adjustment. In the baseline the structural primary balance deteriorates due to lower
structural revenues and the primary spending drift linked to increasing budget rigidities. The
maximum projected 3-year adjustment of the cyclically-adjusted primary balance is close to zero.



Maturity and rollover. Given current debt structure (average maturity just under 5 years,
60 percent share of fixed interest debt to total debt, and only 30 percent denominated in foreign
currency), the direct interest pass-through to the budget is very slow. A 100 basis points shock
to the yield curve is estimated to raise the interest bill by just 0.1 percent of GDP. Similarly, a
5 percent shock in real exchange rate impacts gross public debt stock by just 0.5 pp. During the
whole period, only 30 percent of marketable debt is held by non-residents, which keeps the
rollover risks at a reasonable level.

Shocks and Stress Tests


Primary balance shock. A deterioration of 1.0pp of GDP in the primary balance delays by
2 years the downward trend of debt-to-GDP ratio relative to the baseline. Sovereign borrowing
costs are pushed up (25 bps for each 1 percent of GDP worsening in the primary balance). The
debt-to-GDP ratio and gross financing needs end up at similar levels compared to the baseline
by 2018.



Growth shock. Real output growth rates are lowered by 1 standard deviation, or 4.6 percentage
points, for 2 years starting in 2014. The decline in growth leads to lower inflation
(0.25 percentage points per 1 percentage point decrease in GDP growth). The nominal primary
balance deteriorates significantly compared to the baseline as nominal revenues fall against
unchanged expenditure plans, reaching -3.9 percent of GDP by 2015. The deterioration in
primary balance leads to higher sovereign borrowing costs (see above). The debt-to-GDP ratio
increases to about 43 percent during the growth shock and then stabilizes around 39 percent at
the end of the projection period. Gross financing needs climb toward 15 percent of GDP at the
end of period.



Interest rate shock. Market concerns about medium-term debt sustainability intensify increasing
spreads by 525 bps. The government’s interest bill climbs reaching an implicit average interest
rate of almost 11.1 percent by 2018. The debt-to-GDP ratio remains at low levels reaching just
32.3 percent in 2018, and gross financing needs reach around 12 percent of GDP by 2018.



Contingent liability shock. A one-time bail out of the financial sector increases non-interest
expenditures by 10 percent of banking sector assets. This is combined with real GDP growth
shock (1 standard deviation for 2 years). Sovereign borrowing costs are pushed up (25 bps for
each 1 percent of GDP worsening in the primary balance) while inflation declines
(0.25 percentage points per 1 percentage point decrease in GDP growth). Debt rises to
44 percent of GDP in 2015 and stabilizes at 39 by 2018. Gross financing needs jump to about
17 percent of GDP in 2014 and come down to 14 percent by the end of the period.



Combined shock. A combined shock incorporates the largest effect of individual shocks on all
relevant variables (real GDP growth, inflation, primary balance, exchange rate and interest rate).

44

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

TURKEY

In the case of Turkey, a combined shock would increase debt to around 45 percent of GDP, still
below Turkey’s average debt of 52.1 percent of GDP between 2002 and 2010.

1/ Public sector is defined as non-financial public sector.
2/ Based on available data.
3/ Bond Spread over U.S. Bonds.
4/ Defined as interest payments divided by debt stock at the end of previous year.
5/ Derived as [(r - p(1+g) - g + ae(1+r)]/(1+g+p+gp)) times previous period debt ratio, with r = interest rate; p = growth rate of GDP deflator; g = real GDP growth rate;
a = share of foreign-currency denominated debt; and e = nominal exchange rate depreciation (measured by increase in local currency value of U.S. dollar).
6/ The real interest rate contribution is derived from the denominator in footnote 4 as r - π (1+g) and the real growth contribution as -g.
7/ The exchange rate contribution is derived from the numerator in footnote 2/ as ae(1+r).
8/ For projections, this line includes exchange rate changes during the projection period.
9/ Assumes that key variables (real GDP growth, real interest rate, and other identified debt-creating flows) remain at the level of the last projection year.

ANNEX II: EXTERNAL DEBT SUSTAINABILITY
Turkey’s gross external debt is sustainable under the baseline scenario, but the rising path points
to increased vulnerabilities (see external DSA table). External debt is projected to rise to 50 percent of
GDP by 2018 reflecting the large and widening current account deficit and reliance on debt-creating
inflows. In 2012, despite improvements in the current account balance, external debt-to-GDP ratio
deteriorated on account of slower growth and a continued buildup of external liabilities. These liabilities
continued to grow in the first half of 2013, but the pace has since moderated due to changing external
funding conditions.
Most of the external debt is long term although the share of short-term debt has been rising. At
34 percent of total, the share of short-term debt has almost doubled since end-2009. Financial
institutions account for roughly 70 percent of short-term borrowings. In terms of sector exposure, two
thirds of the total external debt are held by the private sector, with an even split between financial and
non-financial institutions.
The external debt is relatively robust to interest rate, growth, and current account shocks. To be
conservative, the standardized growth shock of one-half standard deviation was replaced with a one
standard deviation shock equivalent to a 4.6 percentage-point reduction in growth. In the same vein, the
interest rate shock was customized to mirror the large increase in spreads experienced in 2008. Under
these scenarios, the standardized current account balance shock, or a combination of the three shocks,
external debt would remain below 60 percent of GDP (see external DSA figure). Turkey’s external debt
sustainability, however, is vulnerable to large exchange rate depreciations. A one-time depreciation of
30 percent would cause the external debt stock to rise above 70 percent of GDP. It should be noted that
individual shock scenarios assume that all other variables follow their baseline paths. In practice, a real
exchange rate shock of this magnitude would precipitate adjustment in the current account that would
help mitigate the impact on external debt.
Given the large external financing requirements, liquidity and rollover risks are the most pertinent
concerns for debt sustainability. Annual gross external financing needs are large at 25 percent of GDP
and are forecast to remain elevated over the medium term. The high current account deficit and the reliance
on short-term financing are the main culprits behind the persistently large external financing needs. Turkey’s
debt sustainability therefore remains susceptible to sudden and sustained shifts in international investors’ risk
appetite, which could trigger a simultaneous increase in both borrowing cost and exchange rate pressure.
Turkey made its last repurchase to the Fund in May 2013.

ANNEX III: THE CBRT'S NEW MONETARY FRAMEWORK
Adoption Date

Description

October 2010–

The interest rate corridor is opened downwards.

August 2011

The CBRT varies volumes of TL-liquidity provided via quantity-based repo auctions.
Volatility of the overnight interbank rates is increased but, on average, they are
kept close to the policy rate.
The CBRT purchases FX via regular auctions.
Reserve Requirement Ratios are differentiated and gradually tightened.

August 2011–

The interest rate corridor is narrowed from below.

October 2011

The CBRT initiates FX selling auctions.
ROM is introduced in September.

October 2011–

The interest rate corridor is opened upwards.

January 2012

The CBRT starts additionally providing TL liquidity via price-based repo auctions.
Effective cost of TL liquidity provided by the CBRT and the interbank rate
decouple from the policy rate and from each other.
FX selling auctions continue and the CBRT conducts several direct interventions
in December-January.
RRRs are lowered, put on hold, and, effectively, dropped from the toolbox.

January 2012–

The interest rate corridor remains wide.

June 2012

The CBRT provides TL liquidity via various repo-facilities with highly-variable
effective cost, which depends on local and global circumstances.
The CBRT conducts no FX auctions or interventions.
Reserve Option Coefficients (ROCs) are introduced in March and are gradually
increased. So is the Reserve Option Ratio.

June 2012–

The CBRT sharply lowers the effective cost of liquidity it provides to the markets.

September 2012
September 2012–

The CBRT in several steps narrows the interest rate corridor from above.

May 2013

The CBRT shifts the whole corridor down.
The cost of liquidity is now close to the policy rate and the interbank rates.

May 2013

The CBRT increases cost of TL liquidity it provides.

onward

Effective cost of TL liquidity provided by the CBRT and the interbank rate again
decouple from the policy rate.
The CBRT reintroduces FX selling auctions.
The CBRT increases reserve requirements (RRR) on ST FX but suggests ROCs and
FX-RRRs could be decreased.

Loan-to-value (LTV) ceilings

Implements loan-to-value ceilings on
housing loans to consumer (at 75 percent)
and on purchases of commercial real estate
(at 50 percent).

December 2010

Implicit Nominal Credit
Growth Target

The authorities provided guidance to banks
that credit growth (adjusted for FX
movements) in 2011 should not exceed
25 percent.

Spring 2011

High risk weights for
consumer loans

Higher risk weights introduced for fast
growing consumer loans. For new general
purpose loans with maturities below two

consumer loans

For new (performing) general purpose
loans, general provisions were increased
from 1 percent to 4 percent. Specific
provisions for (pre-nonperforming) loans
increased from 2 percent to 8 percent. The
higher provisioning requirements are
conditional on banks having a consumer
loan portfolio exceeding 20 percent of total
loans or having a general purpose loan NPL
greater than 8 percent.

WORLD BANK RELATIONS
1.
Turkey and the World Bank Group have a strong partnership, which continuously
deepened over the last twelve years. Country Partnership Strategies (CPSs) form the basis of the
partnership between Turkey and the World Bank. The Country Partnership Strategy FY12–15
envisages financing levels of around US$4.5 billion; the increased provision of analytical and
advisory services as well as new services and instruments—including fee-based services. The CPS has
three main strategic objectives and pillars: (i) enhance competitiveness and employment; (ii) improve
equity and public services; and, (iii) deepen sustainable development. Turkey’s development success
and a number of its economic and social reforms have attracted international interest and
recognition. Together, Turkey and the World Bank are exploring avenues to collaborate in sharing
Turkey’s experience abroad.
2.
Turkey is the IBRD’s second largest borrower in terms of debt outstanding. The active
portfolio of investment projects with World Bank financing includes 11 projects with total net
commitments of US$4.6 billion. The investment portfolio supports financial and private sector
development, urban development, the energy sector, transport, and health and education.
3.
Turkey is the IFC’s second largest exposure in terms of committed portfolio with more
than US$3 billion. Fiscal year 2013 was a record year for the IFC in Turkey with US$985 million of
investments in 20 projects. During the FY12–15, IFC is expected to invest US$1.7–2 billion in Turkey.
So far, it is ahead of this plan and has invested about US$1.8 billion. The IFC is helping Turkey to
address the increasing demand for energy in the country, is contributing to the development of its
domestic capital markets, and is supporting under-served sectors of the economy such as SMEs and
the agribusiness sector. The IFC is also helping Turkey to become a regional leader. It has invested
$580 million in 23 private sector projects with Turkish companies investing outside Turkey. The
establishment of the IFC's Istanbul Operations Center (IOC) has been a successful development for
IFC and supports the government’s goal of establishing Istanbul as an international finance center.
Today, IOC has about 200 staff serving 52 countries in Europe, the Middle East, and North Africa
region (EMENA).
4.
The World Bank Group is engaged in Turkey with its full range of financing as well as
analytic, knowledge, and advisory services. Recent analytic, knowledge, and advisory activities
have included (i) a Programmatic Jobs Series covering the labor market through the economic cycle,
activation of low-skilled youth and women, and the creation of good jobs; (ii) a Country Economic
Memorandum on foreign trade following the previous on savings and sustainable growth; (iii) a
Programmatic Education Series covering quality and basic education, improving early childhood
education and efficiency of delivery of education; (iv) a Programmatic Health Series covering family
medicine, pharmaceuticals and universal health coverage; (v) an investment climate assessment;
(vi) a roadmap for the development of a corporate bond market; (vii) a Transport Public Expenditure
Review; and (viii) technical assistance on food safety, sustainable development, watershed
management and promoting gender equity in the private sector and entrepreneurship. Much
analytic and advisory work is carried out together with the Turkish authorities, the private sector,

academia, or civil society stakeholders. The World Bank Group engages with civil society in the
preparation and implementation of projects and collaborates closely with other development
partners such as the IMF, the EU, UN organizations, and other key bilateral partners.

STATISTICAL ISSUES
1.
Data provision to the Fund is broadly adequate for surveillance purposes, despite
certain shortcomings. Turkey subscribes to the Special Data Dissemination Standard (SDDS).
Real Sector Statistics
2.
Data on producer and consumer prices are published monthly, with a short lag.
Monthly data on industrial production are published with a lag of five to six weeks. The CPI
and the PPI generally conform to international standards. The methodology of the CPI was improved
with the introduction of a 2003-based index, and this new CPI has been in effect since 2005. The
methodology of the CPI was further improved in 2009 regarding the collection of
telecommunication services prices. The new CPI does not cover owner-occupied housing,
commodities produced by households for own consumption, and expenditures on commodities
obtained through in-kind payments. The PPI is compiled according to NACE Rev. 1.
3.
Quarterly national accounts are published with a 2–3 month lag. The Turkish Statistical
Institute (Turkstat) publishes national accounts in current and constant prices for the production and
expenditure approaches to gross domestic product (GDP). Only quarterly GDP data are presented
on a seasonally adjusted basis.
4.
In March 2008, revised annual and quarterly estimates were released for 1998 onwards
following the introduction of ESA 1995 in Turkish National Accounts. However, GDP time series
have not been constructed for years prior to 1998. Work is underway aiming at incorporation of
data from annual collections, the development of independent estimates of household
consumption, and further enhancement of estimates for the non-observed economy. A project
recently initiated aims at extending the scope of the accounts to a full sequence of accounts for the
total economy, annual supply and use tables, and institutional sector accounts.
5.
There is a wide range of data on labor market developments, with the biannual
Household Labor Force Survey (HLFS) replaced with a monthly survey at the beginning
of 2000. These data have been published annually until 2005 and from 2005 are published quarterly
with a three months lag. Coverage of wage developments in the private sector has improved
through the use of quarterly surveys of the manufacturing sector.

6

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

TURKEY

Government Finance Statistics
6.
Budgetary data are published monthly, with a lag of 15 days. Coverage of the budget is
incomplete, with some fiscal operations conducted through extra budgetary funds, for which data
are available only with long lags. Fiscal analysis is further complicated by the omission of certain
transactions from the fiscal accounts, some quasi-fiscal operations carried out by state banks, state
economic enterprises (SEEs), and other public entities; and technical problems associated with
consolidating the cash-based accounts of governmental entities with the accrual-based accounting
of SEEs. It is difficult to reconcile fiscal data with monetary and BOP data, especially in the
accounting of external debt flows and central government deposits. The authorities have requested
technical assistance to improve these and other statistical issues.
7.
Turkey reports fiscal data for publication in the Government Finance Statistics
Yearbook. The latest data available are for 2012 and cover the general government sector and its
subsectors. Monthly data are reported on an irregular basis for publication in International Financial
Statistics, starting from September 2009.
Monetary and Financial Statistics
8.
Data on the central bank balance sheet, and provisional data on the main monetary
aggregates and total domestic credit, are published weekly, with a one- and two-week lag,
respectively. Data on the monetary survey and deposit interest rates are published monthly, with a
one month lag, except for year-end data, where the lag is two months. The CBRT reports to STA the
Standardized Report Form (SRF) 1SR for the Central Bank on a monthly basis with a one month lag
and SRF 2SR for the Other Depository Corporations with a one month lag, except for year-end data,
where the lag is two months.
9.
Public data on banks’ external funding could be improved. The CBRT reports data on
banks foreign assets and liabilities. However, this includes data on transactions with banks’ branches
abroad that are classified as non-residents from the BOP perspective. The BRSA maintains data on
the consolidated banking sector with more accurate information on the true foreign assets and
liabilities; however, this data is not currently disseminated in a public report.
External Sector Statistics
10.
The central bank reports quarterly BOP data to STA with about two months lag; in
May 2012, it started reporting quarterly IIP data from 2006 onwards. The CBRT participates in
the Coordinated Portfolio Investment Survey (CPIS) and Coordinated Direct investment Survey
(CDIS). External sector statistics are compiled in broad conformity with the conceptual framework of
the fifth edition of the Balance of Payments Manual (BPM5).

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
November 27, 2013

International Monetary Fund
700 19th Street, NW
Washington, D. C. 20431 USA

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2013 Article IV Consultation with
Turkey
On November 20, 2013, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF)
concluded the Article IV consultation with Turkey.1
The Turkish economy achieved a welcome reduction of imbalances in 2012. In 2013, growth has
accelerated significantly on the back of a monetary and fiscal policy stimulus. The economy is
projected to expand by 3.8 percent this year with private consumption and public investment as
the main contributors. With this rotation back to domestic demand-led growth, the current
account deficit is widening again, while inflation remains above target.
The authorities are on track to meet their 2013 budget targets, despite rapid spending growth. As
one-off factors boosted revenues beyond projection, the government made use of these windfalls
to increase capital expenditure significantly beyond the budget ceiling, while maintaining its
overall deficit targets. The banking system remains well capitalized, with capital ratios well
above regulatory minima and non-performing loans (NPLs) remaining subdued, despite some
uptick over the last year.
Executive Board Assessment2
Executive Directors noted the faster growth of the Turkish economy this year, due in part to
policy stimulus. Nonetheless, they observed that the domestic demand-led growth is leading to a
renewed deterioration in inflation and the current account deficit. In the period ahead, Directors
encouraged the authorities to tighten their macroeconomic policies and step up structural reforms
to strengthen external performance and bolster economic growth.

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with members, usually
every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial information, and discusses with officials
the country's economic developments and policies. On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which
forms the basis for discussion by the Executive Board.

At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the Board, summarizes the views of
Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the country's authorities. An explanation of any qualifiers

Directors considered a less accommodative monetary stance to be more appropriate in light of
still-high inflation. Most Directors agreed that normalizing the monetary policy framework
would help improve communications and strengthen monetary transmission. Some Directors
noted the challenge faced by the monetary authorities in dealing with volatile capital flows and
noted the improvements in inflation relative to the past. Directors suggested building up net
foreign reserves through sterilized intervention when capital inflows resume.
Directors generally agreed that a tighter fiscal policy would help reduce external vulnerabilities
and relieve pressure on monetary policy. They encouraged the authorities to contain current
spending and save any revenue overperformance. They cautioned that discretionary stimulus
should be reserved for a scenario of potential negative economic outturn. Over the medium term,
fiscal consolidation would raise public saving and contribute to real exchange rate depreciation.
Greater budgetary flexibility would be needed to allow greater spending on priority areas such as
education and infrastructure.
Directors expressed satisfaction that the Turkish financial system is generally sound. They noted,
however, that banks’ indirect exposure to foreign exchange risk requires careful monitoring.
They considered that macroprudential measures should be targeted at household credit and
corporate foreign exchange lending. Directors encouraged further efforts to address the
deficiencies in the regime for anti-money laundering and combating the financing of terrorism
identified by the Financial Action Task Force.
Directors noted the Turkish economy’s low saving rate and reliance on external financing. They
underscored the importance of raising both private and public saving and stepping up structural
reforms to raise competitiveness, attract foreign direct investment, and enhance growth while
reducing external imbalances. The authorities’ efforts to decrease energy dependence, increase
labor market flexibility, reduce the informal sector, and reform private pension are in the right
direction. Further efforts to improve the business climate will also be important.

Statement by Mr. Omer Yalvac, Alternate Executive Director for Turkey and
Mr. Cem Gokcen, Advisor to Executive Director
November 20, 2013
We thank staff for a very productive Article IV mission and comprehensive set of papers.
Although there were several points where the authorities and staff held differing opinions, the
meetings were very fruitful for exchanging views. My authorities appreciated the candid
interaction with staff.
Economic Outlook
Following the policy-induced slowdown in 2012 in an effort to rebalance the economy, growth
gained momentum in the first half of 2013. Figures for the third quarter suggest that the economy
grew more moderately compared to the second quarter. The latest PMI indicators also confirm
this trend. However, the main confidence indicators provide mixed signals regarding the
economic outlook for the remainder of 2013. Bearing in mind the policy-induced slowdown to
2.2 percent in 2012, which was more effective than the initial plan of a slowdown to 3.2, the
authorities are closely monitoring the upside and downside risks.
In order to further strengthen the economy’s resilience and break the vicious cycle of growing
external weaknesses, the authorities have focused on a comprehensive plan. The 10th
Development Plan has specified the underlying factors of the Turkish economy’s structural
weaknesses. The Plan has put forward medium- and long-term policy targets for improving
domestic savings and transforming the economy into one that is more productive and
competitive. The authorities have prepared the Medium-Term Program in line with the priorities
listed in the 10th Development Plan. The Program’s main goals are: (1) putting the current
account on a sustainable path; (2) lowering the inflation rate; (3) maintaining a strong fiscal
stance; and (4) boosting growth potential and creating jobs.
Focusing on the root causes of the problem, the Medium-Term Program provides a multi-faceted
response to external imbalances with the support of well-calibrated monetary, fiscal, as well as
macroprudential and structural policies. First and foremost, measures that promote domestic
private and public savings will be at the core. As a consequence of targeted policies coupled with
the introduction of new measures in the private pension system, the domestic savings rate is
projected to reach 16 percent in 2016, implying an increase of 3.4 percentage points in the
following 3 years.
Fiscal Policy
The authorities have continued to maintain a cautious fiscal stance. In order to contribute to
domestic savings, the central government’s budget deficit target in 2013 was revised down from
2.2 percent to 1.2 percent in the Medium-Term Program. This has been one of the lowest central
government budget deficit figures in the last three decades. The over-performance in revenues
stemming from acceleration of growth, one-off revenues from energy state-owned enterprises
(SOEs), and last year’s administered price hikes were partially saved.

The 2014 budget was also formulated with the same cautious approach. Budget revenues were
assumed to increase by approximately 7.1 percent in parallel with the nominal increase in the
domestic demand. Budget expenditures were expected to increase by about 7.3 percent, which is
in line with the nominal growth rate. As a result, the central government budget deficit is
projected to be around 1.9 percent in 2014.
The strong budget performance has helped to further lower the EU-defined public debt-to-GDP
ratio to around 35 percent in 2013 and this downward trend is expected to continue in the coming
years. The low level of public debt, coupled with improvements in its composition, has
established an important buffer for the coming period.
While formulating fiscal policies, the authorities have taken into consideration both global
uncertainties and the economy’s domestic needs. They have tried to strike the right balance
between saving and spending prudently to improve the current account deficit. In parallel with
the priorities listed in the 10th Development Plan, the expenditure policy in the Medium-Term
Program has been geared towards improving structural deficiencies. In this vein, the largest share
has been allocated to education, which has been a very important bottleneck for improving
competitiveness. The ratio of education expenditures to GDP has been increased to 4.6 percent in
2014. In order to improve infrastructure, the investment allocation has been raised to 2.6 percent
of GDP. Although the increase in current expenditures via recruiting more teachers, social
security, and tax inspectors could lead to higher budget rigidities, the benefit from improving the
educational system and reining in the unregistered economy would be higher than the costs
incurred in the short term.
Financial and Corporate Sector
The Turkish banking sector has gone through another significant stress test during the latest
market turmoil. Despite the recent mark-to market losses on banks’ balance sheets, the system’s
capital adequacy level is approximately 16 percent, according to the Basel 2.5 definition.
Non-performing loan ratios remain low and bank profitability has been strong. The corporate
sector’s FX loans have increased the banking system’s indirect exposure to FX risk. However,
the authorities have taken several measures to reduce risks. These loans are extended mostly to
large corporations, which have FX income. Additionally, they are not concentrated in a few
sectors. Nevertheless, the authorities are closely following the developments.
Despite the banking sector’s strength, the authorities are working proactively on additional
macroprudential measures that target credit cards as well as SME and export loans. In line with
staff’s recommendation, they are keen on not creating any distortions. These measures are also
expected to support the economy’s resilience and improve the current account balance in line
with the Medium-Term Program targets. In particular, the measures associated with credit cards
could maintain the household sector’s strength and rein in private consumption.
The corporate sector’s FX borrowing from Turkish banks and abroad has been striking.
Nevertheless, the rollover ratio of the corporate sector has been very high, even in the wake of
the Lehman Brothers crisis. The latest figures also show that despite higher costs, the rollover

ratio has exceeded over 120 percent. The high level of rollover ratios is due to strong collaterals.
As discussed during the mission, more data and information are needed to ensure proper
regulatory insight regarding the risks stemming from this area.
Monetary Policy
The Central Bank has continued to implement the new policy framework with additional
adjustments. Similar to what many central banks around the world did, the main aim was to
adapt the monetary policy to the ever-changing and unconventional global liquidity conditions
and to serve the needs of the economy.
The developments in 2012 have illustrated that the new policy framework has contributed
positively to the achievements in inflation and financial stability. The consumer price index has
reached 6.2 percent, the lowest year-end figure in 44 years. With regard to financial stability, the
annual rate of credit growth has declined from around 35 percent at the end of 2010 to around
18 percent at the end of 2012. The current account balance has also improved. The current
account deficit-to-GDP ratio has come down from 9.7 percent in 2011 to 6.1 percent at the end
of 2012. Overall, growth slowed down to 2.2 percent despite the high level of liquidity in the
global markets.
2013 was a critical year as the resilience of many emerging market countries was tested.
Financial market volatility was mostly a result of repricing of risks and reallocation of funds. In
response to heightened global risks, the authorities started to implement a cautious monetary
policy taking into consideration inflation indicators and macro-financial risks. Liquidity policy,
macroprudential policy and, to a more measured extent, fiscal policy were tightened. Regarding
inflation dynamics, a weaker Turkish lira led to a limited rise in the annual consumer price
inflation. The inflation forecast for 2013 was revised upwards by 0.6 percent. The 0.4 percentage
points of revision was due to exchange rate developments, and 0.1 percent was coming from the
change in the average oil price assumption.
In terms of financial stability, the cautious monetary policy and rising loan rates under the
current monetary framework have helped rein in strong credit growth which was observed in the
first half of 2013. Regarding the external balance, the current account deficit has started to
deteriorate to some extent since January. Nevertheless, this deterioration stemmed mainly from
gold trade, which was a temporary but sizable factor (about 1 percent of GDP). The
improvement in the non-gold current account balance, which started in 2012, has continued in
2013. The authorities also expect the real exchange rate and credit developments to support the
continuation of the improvement in the current account balance in the coming period as well.
So far, the new policy framework has positively contributed to the efforts in rebalancing the
economy and in preserving financial stability. The historically low inflation level in 2012 and the
resilience shown in the second half of 2013 also prove that the macroprudential measures in the
new policy framework have been helpful. The authorities are closely following global and
domestic developments and are adjusting the policies accordingly. We should bear in mind that
all central banks are strengthening their toolkits and policy strategies to cope with the new global
challenges due to high volatility in capital flows.

The new three-year Medium-Term Program, which was published recently, relies mainly on
structural and macroprudential measures in order to boost the private savings rate in Turkey.
This will contribute to a more balanced and sustainable growth prospect, while enabling the
Central Bank to focus fully on the price stability objective.
Structural Policy
The Medium-Term Program puts forward priority areas that will be closely followed to improve
domestic savings and reduce the current account deficit. In particular, energy imports are an
important drag on the current account deficit. With an import dependency rate of over 70 percent
in the energy area, Turkey needs to diversify its energy sources and lower energy intensity so as
to contain the energy import bill. To this end, the authorities have put strong emphasis on
utilizing domestic sources, resorting to renewable and nuclear energy, improving energy
efficiency and stepping up exploration efforts both in Turkey and overseas.
Last but not least, the authorities are aware of the need for more efforts to improve the business
and investment environment, and to boost competitiveness in order to increase Turkey’s share in
Foreign Direct Investment. This could also positively contribute to the financing of the current
account deficit. Nevertheless, the ongoing economic and financial problems in European
countries (which have been an important source of FDI) are not supporting the current initiatives.
