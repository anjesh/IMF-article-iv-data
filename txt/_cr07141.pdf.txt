Staff Report for the 2006 Article IV Consultation
Prepared by the Staff Representatives for the
2006 Consultation with St. Kitts and Nevis
Approved by Christopher Towe and Matthew Fisher
December 20, 2006
Economic background and focus of discussions. St. Kitts and Nevis is a small, very open,
middle-income economy with a population of about 46,000 and per capita income of over
US$9,500. The sugar industry—historically the mainstay of the economy—was closed in July
2005 and discussions focused on the transition strategy, particularly on the measures needed
to bring down the very high public debt burden, realize the economy’s growth potential, and
to reduce vulnerabilities.
Political situation. St. Kitts and Nevis form a twin-island federation with a unicameral
Parliament consisting of 14 representatives—8 elected in St. Kitts, 3 elected in Nevis, and
3 appointees. In the National Assembly elections held in October 2004, the incumbent Labor
Party was re-elected with a large majority. Premier Parry’s Nevis Reformation Party (NRP)
assumed office in Nevis following elections on July 10, 2006, after 14 years in opposition.
The NRP campaign emphasized improved health care, better social programs, and a lower
cost of living. The new government on Nevis has taken a conciliatory approach to interisland relations.
Discussions: The consultation took place during October 3–17, 2006. The team comprised
D. O. Robinson (Head), M. Mlachila, N. Mwase, and E. Tsounta (all WHD), and was joined
by staff of the ECCB and the Caribbean Development Bank (CDB). J. Fried (OED)
participated in the final meetings. The team met with Prime Minister Douglas, Deputy Prime
Minister Condor, Nevis Premier Parry, other senior officials in the federal government and the
Nevis Island Administration, and representatives of the Opposition, trade unions, and the
private sector.
Fund relations and statistics. The last Article IV consultation was concluded on
December 21, 2005. St. Kitts and Nevis has no outstanding Fund resources. A summary of
Executive Board discussions is found at:
http://www.imf.org/external/np/sec/pn/2006/pn0611.htm.
Improvements are needed in several key areas to facilitate more effective surveillance,
including national accounts, debt statistics, and general government statistics.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
Background
Economic activity has strengthened. Growth accelerated to 4½ percent in 2006 driven by
construction and tourism. The closure of the sugar industry in 2005 has had a limited impact on
growth and the balance of payments, but has increased government debt and debt service costs.
Large adjustments in petroleum and electricity prices created a temporary spike in inflation.
Fiscal balances have improved significantly, but debt remains very high. The central
government primary surplus is projected to reach 6 percent of GDP in 2006, an adjustment of
more than 6 percent of GDP since 2004. Gross public sector debt declined only modestly to
190 percent of GDP at end-2005, due to significant borrowing by public enterprises.
The government has reiterated its commitment to debt reduction. A comprehensive
post-sugar adaptation strategy is being developed, supported by public outreach. The strategy is
based on sustained fiscal adjustment, asset sales, and structural reform.
Policy discussions
Discussions focused on increasing growth and restoring fiscal and debt sustainability. This
will require continued efforts to strengthen the business environment, improve fiscal balances,
accelerate the scope and pace of government asset sales, and reduce vulnerabilities.
Raising growth potential will require additional efforts in a number of areas, including
putting former sugar lands to more productive use, strengthening the investment climate,
improving the tax incentive regime, and enhancing the efficiency of labor and financial markets.
The authorities have announced an ambitious, but feasible, program of fiscal consolidation.
The fiscal strategy includes the introduction of a VAT and the corporatization of the loss-making
electricity sector, as well as improved prioritization of the capital budget, and refinancing of
high-cost debt. The authorities are also taking steps to enhance the institutional setting for fiscal
policy.
There is need to significantly improve the transparency and accountability of public
enterprises. Without proper monitoring of their financial operations, there is a risk that fiscal
consolidation undertaken by the central government could be undone.
Vulnerabilities to exogenous shocks are high, but the greatest risks may stem from delays in
domestic policy reforms. Even with a large fiscal adjustment and robust growth, public debt is
likely to remain very high for a number of years, constraining the ability to address social
priorities and pointing to the need for exploring options for a more rapid debt reduction and
strengthened financial sector supervision.

4
I. CONTEXT
1.
In July 2005, the sugar industry—the historical mainstay of the economy—
closed after more than 300 years. The industry had incurred substantial losses—on
the order of 3–4 percent of GDP annually in the last several years—even before the
announced further cut in preferential access to the EU market. The sugar industry had
occupied about 9,300 acres of land (about a quarter of the land surface of St. Kitts) and
employed about 1,400 workers (6 percent of the labor force). The closure has required
the government to service the debt of the sugar company (29 percent of GDP).
2.
St. Kitts and Nevis faces the challenge of absorbing the labor and land
released from the sugar sector and of coping with a substantial public debt burden.
In consultation with the EU, a comprehensive medium-term strategy has been prepared
to guide the transition of resources from sugar to more productive uses. Gross public
debt—accumulated as a result of a series of exogenous shocks (including three
hurricanes in the second half of the 1990s) and an accommodative policy stance—
reached 190 percent of GDP at end-2005, creating a significant vulnerability and
limiting the scope for fiscal policy to ease the transition (Figure 1). Encouragingly, the
2006 Budget Speech emphasized the need for fiscal consolidation, and announced
medium-term fiscal and public debt targets supported by an ambitious tax reform.
3.
Ensuring strong social outcomes has been a high priority. The policy
response to the large exogenous shocks during the 1990s focused on government-led
investment to spur growth, sustain employment, and maintain living standards. Partly

4.
Discussions focused on the authorities’ transition strategy, the prioritization
of reforms, and options for reducing risks. The discussions were complemented by
the 2006 Eastern Caribbean Currency Union Regional Discussions.
5.
The authorities generally agreed with the staff’s analysis and
recommendations, but, as in the past, were more sanguine about the risks
stemming from the debt stock. In discussions on both St Kitts and on Nevis, there was
a clear consensus on the need to reduce debt to a more manageable level, based on
sustained fiscal consolidation and strong growth. The authorities emphasized that risks
implied by the high debt level were mitigated by the government’s substantial assets,
particularly land. Key components of the authorities’ transition strategy—such as the tax
reform—have been discussed in previous consultations, but implementation has been
held back by the desire to build broad public consensus for the reforms.

excises on alcohol and tobacco. However, noninterest expenditures were also curbed,
despite the severance payments to sugar workers (2 percent of GDP in 2005 and
½ percent of GDP in 2006).
Box 1. St. Kitts and Nevis: Macroeconomic Impact of Closing the Sugar Industry
Considerable long-term economic benefits are anticipated, but there will be significant transitional costs.
Key benefits are likely to stem from the release of land and labor resources to more productive uses, thereby
raising growth potential, as well as halting the incurrence of quasi-fiscal losses that were aggravating an already
difficult debt situation. Transitional costs include:
•

The severance package for the 1,406 sugar workers of EC$27.4 million (2.3 percent of 2005 GDP).
EC$22.5 million was paid during 2005 and the remainder in March 2006. The government provided
eligible workers with a package of up to 104 weeks’ pay, consistent with the 1961 Severance Agreement
Act.

•

The government is servicing the debt of the St. Kitts Sugar Manufacturing Company (SSMC),
increasing the central government interest bill by 1½ percent of GDP a year. The debt is in the form
of a 30-year bond at 5.2 percent interest rate—about 80 percent of the debt is held by the majority stateowned National Bank, with the remainder currently held by the Development Bank (the debt is to be
consolidated with that at the former institution). The debt is secured by approximately 4,700 acres of land.
Principal repayments are scheduled at EC$57 million every five years, but the National Bank retains the
option of requesting prepayment if it faces any liquidity problems.

•

Transfers to former sugar workers are set to increase over the medium term. Under the severance
agreement, the sugar workers will receive medical care under the National Health Program, and the
SSMC pensioners will be transferred to the Social Security Scheme with the guarantee that their pensions
will not be reduced. In addition, land has been allocated to workers who wanted to become farmers, and a
housing scheme is to be implemented for workers with long tenure (20 years or more) who do not own
homes and have income levels below the poverty line.

•

Near-term impacts on growth and foreign exchange earnings are estimated to be modest. Sugar
export proceeds had declined to an average of 2½ percent of GDP a year during 2000–04 with a limited
contribution to value added in the economy.

Transition costs may be offset by two factors:
•

The booming economy and initial low level of unemployment has enabled the quick reabsorption of
most workers into the labor force. A survey conducted by the Sugar Transition office in May–June
2006 found that only 317 former workers were unemployed.

•

The European Union has pledged grant support to African Caribbean Pacific (ACP) sugar
producers affected by the erosion of trade preferences. Precise amounts and modalities for receipt are
still to be finalized, but the authorities sugar transition strategy document has been reviewed and approved
by the EU.

8.
Nonetheless, substantial borrowing by public entities resulted in the public
debt/GDP ratio falling only modestly during 2005 (Figure 3). Public entities—such as
the Port Authority and various land development companies—contracted an estimated
11 percent of GDP in new loans during 2004–05. The gross financing needs of the

8
government have been met by increased reliance on domestic financing—the overdraft
facility at the state-owned National Bank surged to almost 20 percent of GDP by
mid-2006.
9.
The current account deficit remains very large (25 percent of GDP in 2005),
but has been mainly financed by foreign direct investment, and competitiveness
appears to be improving. The pickup in tourism receipts was offset by the higher cost of
oil imports, a strong rebound in non-oil imports reflecting the construction boom, and the
cessation of sugar exports.
10.
Available data point to a strong improvement in competitiveness in recent
years (Figure 4). The real exchange rate has depreciated sharply with the depreciation of
the U.S. dollar and is now at its lowest level in more than 15 years. Tourism receipts have
increased and St. Kitts and Nevis’s share in both the ECCU and Caribbean tourism
markets has risen. While tourism prospects are sensitive to both price and nonprice
factors, the strong interest from investors in a number of new projects suggests the
absence of a competitiveness concern.
11.
Consistent with growth in economic activity, private credit has rebounded.
During 2004–05, private credit grew by 8 percent a year, and is projected to increase by
more than 10 percent in 2006, with the largest increases in real estate, household, and
agricultural sectors.
12.
Prudential indicators point to a strengthening of the banking sector, with
risks concentrated in locally-incorporated banks. Locally-incorporated banks have
substantial exposures to the government—particularly at the National Bank which holds
about 60 percent of deposits in the banking system and is the largest indigenous bank in
the ECCU. System-wide NPLs declined, though largely due to the acceleration in credit
growth. Capital adequacy ratios are well above prudential guidelines, but have to be
interpreted with care due to the low levels of provisions (Figure 5).
13.
Progress on structural reforms has been slow. The authorities have developed a
comprehensive strategy for dealing with the transition from sugar, that may help to
unlock grants from the EU, but this first required extensive consultations with
stakeholders. Privatization of public entities has been particularly sluggish, with little
achieved in the last ten years.

III. THE TRANSITION STRATEGY
14.
The authorities have formulated a comprehensive strategy to transition from
sugar to a sustainable growth path, while ensuring fiscal and debt sustainability.
The strategy was the focal point for National Consultations held in October 2006. There
are two key pillars:
•

Growth driven by structural reforms to enhance productivity, supported by public
sector interventions to develop high-end tourism projects (Box 2); and

•

Fiscal consolidation to provide the fiscal space for public investments to meet
social objectives, and to reduce debt in order to weather the economy’s
vulnerabilities to exogenous shocks.
A. Realizing Growth Potential

15.
Medium-term growth prospects appear favorable. The authorities noted that
tourism would continue to be the main driver of the economy, but other sectors such as
agriculture and information and communications technology were also expected to
become more dynamic. A number of very large private sector tourism projects—some
with planned investments of over 50 percent of GDP—are in the pipeline and could
significantly enhance growth prospects.
16.
Staff noted that the pace and modalities for transferring government assets
to the private sector will be key to realizing growth. The experience with the
privatization program, which has been subject to substantial delays, underscores the need
for an effective mechanism for transferring assets to the private sector. In particular, staff
urged the formal adoption of a transparent land management strategy to clearly establish
the procedures for land sales and land use. The authorities acknowledged the importance
of putting assets to more productive uses, but stressed the need to ensure that land sales
did not result in the disenfranchisement of the local population. Similarly, a key goal of
the privatization program was to empower the local populace, and the modalities for
achieving this were still under debate.
17.
The investment climate needs to be strengthened. The World Bank’s Doing
Business Indicators survey highlighted numerous administrative obstacles that constrain
the development of small- and medium-sized enterprises and associated employment
opportunities (Figure 6). Staff also suggested that the withdrawal of the public sector
from commercial activities—including through outsourcing select government services—
could make greater room for the private sector.

14

Box 2. The Authorities’ Growth Strategy
The strategy was articulated in the Adaptation Strategy for St. Kitts and Nevis in Response to the New EU Sugar
Regime. It covers a broad range of economic, social and environmental measures that aim to diversify and improve
the competitiveness of the economy, including:
Tourism
•

Developing high-end facilities, such as villas, marinas and golf courses, with the public sector playing a key
role in developing infrastructure and marketing the new developments.

•

Strengthening land development agencies. Public entities involved in land development are to be
consolidated with professional management and enhanced financial expertise.

•

Upgrading the international airport to increase carrying capacity for wide-bodied jets, and constructing a
separate terminal for private jets through a private-public partnership.

•

Restructuring the Port Authority to make it more commercially oriented.

Agriculture
•

About 1,500 acres of sugar lands are to be reserved for agricultural use.

•

Enhancing linkages to the tourism sector by expanding the production of locally-grown fruits and vegetables
through the development of surface water sources and a comprehensive marketing program to encourage the
supply of local produce to the hospitality sector.

•

Subsidies to farmers. New tax exemptions on import duty and consumption tax on agricultural inputs.

Empowerment of vulnerable groups
•

Retraining opportunities for ex-sugar workers in new skills such as agriculture, carpentry, craft production,
and landscaping.

•

Small business loans through the recently-established Empowerment Fund that has seed money amounting to
EC$10 million. Loans of up to EC$100,000 are available at an interest rate of 6 percent, and a maturity of up to
seven years.

actual investment.

of the opportunities afforded by membership in the CARICOM Single Market (CSM).
The authorities expressed their commitment to the CSM, but argued that labor migration
had to be handled carefully in a small economy, especially given the risk that migrants
could overwhelm social safety nets.

17

B. Achieving Fiscal and Debt Sustainability
20.
The authorities have announced an ambitious medium-term fiscal strategy
aimed at boosting the primary budget surplus to 8 percent of GDP and reducing
public debt to around 117 percent of GDP by 2010 (Box 3). The strategy, laid out in
the 2006 budget, is based on a broad tax reform, efforts to strengthen capital budgeting
and the operations of public enterprises, and improved debt management. The staff
welcomed the elaboration of a fiscal strategy but noted that achieving the targeted
reduction in debt will depend critically on the magnitude and timing of asset sales, in
addition to the growth outcome and the absence of exogenous shocks.

Box 3. The Authorities’ Fiscal Strategy
The 2006 budget stated a target for the primary surplus of 8 percent of GDP over the medium-term, and a
reduction in public debt to about 117 percent of GDP by 2010. Key components are:
Tax reform
•

Introducing a VAT, to replace the current consumption tax, as well as a raft of “nuisance” taxes.

•

Reforming the social security levy, to make it more progressive and capture a wider range of incomes
beyond salaries.

•

Moving to market-based property tax.

•

Further improvements in tax administration.

Expenditure reform
•

Improving prioritization of the capital budget, through greater reliance on the public sector
investment program (PSIP).

•

Pension reform, to contain the costs of civil service pensions and ensure the long-term viability of the
Social Security Scheme.

•

Commercializing the Electricity Department to enhance efficiency and reduce losses.

•

Public enterprise reform to enhance the quality of service provision and ensure greater accountability
through the provision of regular audited financial statements.

•

Revising the Finance and Administration Act to strengthen expenditure management.

Debt management

•

Refinancing the most costly debt obligations.

authorities supported staff’s suggestion
that an OECS body be charged with developing a regional approach to setting
expenditure policies—as was done previously for tax policy. A few options for reducing
expenditure were identified:
•

Electricity Department: The department has long been beset by high technical
losses, nonpayment of bills, and low regulated rates—in 2005, the estimated
revenue shortfall compared to expenditures amounted to EC$31 million
(2½ percent of GDP). At the same time, increased investment is needed to prevent
electricity shortages from constraining growth. The authorities noted that a reform
plan is being developed to limit the losses, and that the introduction of a fuelsurcharge has helped improve revenues. The government is working with the
CDB to corporatize the electricity department within the next 18 months.
•

Public sector wage bill: The
government’s wage bill is
the second highest in the
ECCU, in part due to the
operation of parallel
administrations on each of
the islands. The authorities
argued that avenues for
streamlining were largely
limited to containing annual
wage increments. Staff noted

19
that policy coordination between the two islands appeared to have improved
following the change in regime on Nevis—indeed, a program of regular meetings
of the two cabinets had been initiated—and urged consideration of the elimination
of duplication in government service provision.
•

Capital expenditure: It was agreed that better prioritization of capital
expenditures—including by formalizing the PSIP mechanism—could enhance the
effectiveness of expenditures.

•

Pension reforms: Civil service pension payments will increase sharply as more
civil servants retire. Staff endorsed the government’s plan to establish a more
financially-sustainable and more equitable system, notably by eliminating or
capping the double pension for civil servants, and moving to a contribution-based
pension plan for new civil servants.3

23.
The authorities’ tax reform agenda appropriately focuses on broadening the
tax base, rather than raising tax rates. The proposals—which involve a broad-based
consumption tax (VAT), a personal income tax (PIT), and a modernized property tax—
are in line with the recommendations of the 2003 report by the OECS Tax Reform and
Administration Commission that is being adopted throughout the region.
•

VAT: The government intends to introduce a VAT during 2008. In addition to
harmonizing legislation with the rest of the region and improving the efficiency of
the tax system, the VAT would help replace revenues likely to be lost as the
obligations to bring tariffs in line with Phase IV of the CARICOM Common
External Tariff (CET) are met. Staff emphasized the need to ensure adequate
preparation, and encouraged establishing a single rate with limited exemptions in
order to minimize administrative costs and leakages.

•

Personal income tax: The existing social services levy is an inefficient and
regressive tax. While some degree of progressivity was introduced in 2006, the
focus on wage income creates an incentive for nonwage compensation. Given
constraints on implementation capacity, staff recommended broadening the
definition of income in the existing social services levy instead of introducing
new PIT legislation at the present time.

•

Market-based property tax: The strong performance of the real estate sector has
not translated into higher property tax collections. The authorities noted that
legislation to introduce a market-based valuation system had been enacted and
that a cadastral survey was underway.

24.
There was broad agreement on the need for strengthened control over the
operations of public enterprises. The absence of information on the operations of the
public enterprise sector—which control substantial assets of the government and have

20
contracted significant amounts of new debt in recent years—is a problem that needs to be
addressed by enforcing existing requirements for reporting of audited financial statements
for all public enterprises to Parliament. Additional steps include:
•

Enacting the draft Finance and Administration Act (FAA). Staff recommended
that the revised FAA provide explicit means for ensuring the provision of timely
information by public enterprises to the Ministry of Finance and Parliament, as
well as penalties for noncompliance. Staff encouraged the authorities to ensure
that debt contracted by these entities is carefully monitored and controlled, for
example, by requiring that such borrowing be countersigned by the Ministry of
Finance and subject to annual limits approved in the budget.

•

Strengthening the legal and institutional framework for public debt guarantees.
Current procedures for guaranteeing debt are ad hoc and offer few safeguards on
the financial soundness of the underlying borrowing. Staff advised that borrowing
by public enterprises using land as collateral rather than an explicit government
guarantee should also be reviewed. The authorities agreed that contingent
liabilities relating to public enterprises and infrastructure projects should be
closely monitored, and requested Fund assistance in this regard.

25.
For 2007, the fiscal position is expected to be largely unchanged relative to
2006. The revenue reforms will take time to come into effect and, given the likely
significant increase in capital expenditures—in part related to road construction in Nevis
that is already under way—staff recommended that the year 2007 should be used to lock
in gains made in 2006. The increase in capital expenditures is likely to offset continued
improvements in revenue mobilization supported by buoyant economic activity, as well
as discipline over spending on both wages and goods and services.
26.
A cornerstone of the authorities’ strategy is the refinancing of expensive
debt. In October 2006 the CDB approved a policy-based guarantee on a proposed tenyear bond to be floated by the government in early 2007.4 The staff emphasized that any
new borrowing from capital markets should be undertaken as part of a coherent debt
management strategy focused on repaying high-cost debt and not lead to a relaxation in
the fiscal stance. In addition, staff noted the importance of establishing a debt
management unit to monitor existing debt, help avoid bunching of future debt payments,
reduce debt service costs, and formulate a strategy for retiring high-cost debt.

4

The guarantee would cover one year of debt service payments, and would be renewed annually.

well above 100 percent of GDP
throughout the medium term. Moreover, the fiscal position will remain vulnerable given
the economy’s dependence on tourism, susceptibility to natural disasters, emerging fiscal
pressures from population aging, and the difficulty of sustaining such a large surplus for a
long period of time. Debt service costs, as a share of GDP, are now the highest in the
region and significantly exceed expenditures on health or education and, if unaddressed,
will constrain the ability to address priority concerns.
29.
While acknowledging the risks, the authorities reiterated their determination
to honor their debt obligations, emphasizing that government’s asset holdings
exceed the value of the debt. The authorities noted that the value of their land holdings
as well as the assets slated for privatization provided a clear indication of the solvency of
the government. In this regard, they noted that about 1,200 acres of land would be sold to
retire the sugar debt.

Active: Real GDP growth averages 4 percent over the medium term, the primary surplus reaches
8 percent of GDP, asset sales generate net proceeds of 3 percent of GDP a year, and no new net borrowing
by public enterprises.
Passive: Growth slows to 2½ percent of GDP a year. Fiscal expenditures revert to historical levels,
ultimately pushing the primary balance into deficit.
Natural disaster: reflecting historical incidence, a hurricane is assumed every fourth year (2007, 2011),
with damage at average historical impact.
Lower growth: Fiscal path as in active scenario but no progress in structural reform so that growth
declines as in passive scenario.

Against this background, staff emphasized the importance of exploring
options for a more rapid reduction in the debt stock:

•

Accelerating the scope and pace of asset sales. Staff encouraged the
authorities to view land sales (and privatization more generally) in the
broader context of the government’s asset-liability management strategy and
not to tie land sales to the amount needed to repay the sugar debt.

•

Strenuous efforts to tap concessional financing. Staff stressed, in particular,
the importance of working closely with the EU to ensure the timely
disbursement of grant funds earmarked for the transition from sugar.5

The EU has announced that €1.3 billion will be made available to ACP sugar producers during 2007–13,
but neither country allocations nor disbursement modalities have been finalized.

Financial sector risks need to be monitored carefully. Like most countries in
the region, bank credit to the private sector has increased sharply in the last year. While

carefully. While the government has
maintained a strong payments record, any disruption to the government’s payment
capacity—for example, due to an exogenous shock such as a hurricane—could seriously
impact the domestic banking system.
32.
Efforts are also underway to improve the supervision and regulation of the
financial sector, but enforcement remains weak. The authorities have introduced riskweighting on nonperforming government assets, and enacted a new Banking Act that
enhances the supervisory powers of the ECCB. A Single Regulatory Unit is being formed
to oversee nonbank financial institutions—credit unions, insurance companies, finance
companies, mortgage institutions, offshore and money remittance businesses. They are
also working with the ECCB to harmonize and improve domestic insurance legislation as
well as prepare specific legislation for the supervision of offshore businesses. Staff
welcomed these efforts and emphasized that while currently small, the nonbank financial
institutions appeared to be growing rapidly, including into some areas that closely
resembled banking activity but absent the supervision. Thus prompt enactment and
implementation of needed legislation was a high priority. Progress has been made in
AML/CFT to improve the supervisory powers and the regulatory framework to reflect
ongoing changes in the financial system.6
33.
Population aging will create
additional fiscal pressures. The number of
retirees is projected to rise rapidly over the
next several years in the context of a broadly
stable population. Pressures for increased
health and other age-related spending are
likely to emerge and the staff encouraged the
authorities to clearly define the role of the
government and private sector in health care
provision. The social security system is
projected to see a significant tightening in its
financial position and the staff advised the
authorities to initiate parametric reforms,

of social security.
V. STAFF APPRAISAL
34.
Economic outcomes and prospects have improved considerably over the last
few years. Growth has re-emerged, new investment is being undertaken, and the bold
decision to close the sugar industry has released both labor and land for more productive
uses. Indeed, the current strength of the economy appears to have facilitated a relatively
smooth absorption of former sugar workers within the economy.
35.
Commendable progress has been made in reducing fiscal imbalances, but
these efforts could be undermined by the public enterprise sector. The primary
balance of the central government has moved into strong surplus, driven by increased
revenue effort. However, these efforts could be undone absent strengthened control over
the operations of the public enterprise sector. Enforcing existing requirements for
reporting audited financial statements for all public enterprises to Parliament and
requiring contracting of debt to be subject to effective Ministry of Finance review are key
priorities.
36.
The very high public debt stock remains a source of concern. While the
government has continued to service its obligations in a timely manner, the debt service
burden is rising and the government’s payments capacity could be stretched in the event
of a shock or a downturn in the economy that, given high government exposures, could
significantly impact the domestic banking system.
37.
The authorities’ strategy going forward appropriately targets growth and
debt reduction. The transition strategy document contains a broad structural reform
agenda and a comprehensive tax reform. Given institutional capacity constraints, a
careful prioritization of reforms is essential to ensure timely and effective implementation
of key measures. Sustaining the reforms, including the strong primary surplus for many
years, represents a considerable policy challenge pointing to a need for increased
outreach efforts and policy transparency to foster the required public consensus.
38.
A solid foundation is being laid for public finances, but more focus could be
given to establishing expenditure priorities and strengthening expenditure controls.
The proposed tax reform appropriately involves the introduction of VAT, refinement of a
personal income tax, and a modernized property tax, that would broaden the tax base and
improve its structure and efficiency. Given the fairly compressed timetable for
introduction of the VAT, it is imperative that this be a focus of capacity building efforts
on both St. Kitts and Nevis. Sustaining the envisaged large primary surpluses will require
sustained expenditure restraint. Thus efforts are needed to ensure the efficacy of
expenditures—particularly capital projects through a strengthened PSIP process—and
that actual expenditures are in line with government priorities. The wage bill remains
very high and opportunities for streamlining public sector employment, including the
collective provision of government services at both the federal and regional level, could
be explored. Impending fiscal challenges related to population aging should be explicitly
addressed to ensure clarity of expectations on the role to be played by the government in
areas such as health.

25
39.
A strengthened investment climate would help sustain growth and
competitiveness over the medium term. Recent growth has been driven by construction
and it is vital to ensure a transition to more sustainable growth sources. In this context, a
clear and transparent land management strategy will be key to attracting investment and
facilitating asset sales. Additional efforts could also be made to foster domestic
investment, for example through addressing identified weaknesses in business licensing
and regulation, and in the legal system. Labor market constraints could be relieved
through enhanced labor mobility under the CSM to broaden the available skills mix and
offer new opportunities for the unemployed. Efforts to increase the efficiency and
reliability of public utilities, as currently underway at the Electricity Department, are also
a high priority. The combination of these reforms should serve to lower the cost of doing
business and therefore strengthen competitiveness.
40.
However, even with the full implementation of the authorities’ strategy and
with a benign external environment, significant risks remain. The public debt stock
will remain very high for many years. Key downside risks stem from natural disasters, a
disruption to global tourism, or undue delays in the completion of the major new
investment projects. Thus efforts to achieve a more rapid reduction in debt, including by
accelerating the pace of asset sales and improved debt management, should be
considered. It will also be important for the authorities to work closely with the European
Union to ensure the timely disbursal of available grants.
41.
Emerging financial sector risks need to be monitored carefully. The
authorities have passed the Amendments to the Uniform Banking Act enabling an
improvement in the effectiveness of bank supervision. Additional steps are underway to
strengthen the supervision of the nonbank sector, and rapid progress in making effective
the single regulatory unit and supporting legislation is a priority.
42.
While the statistical database has improved in recent years, weaknesses
remain that adversely affect the quality of economic analyses and policy
implementation. Improvements in the reliability and timeliness of key data including of
tourism indicators, debt, and public enterprise activities, are urgently needed.
43.
It is proposed that the next Article IV consultation be conducted on the
standard 12-month cycle.

ANNEX I. SUMMARY OF INFORMATIONAL ANNEXES

Fund relations. St. Kitts and Nevis has no outstanding Fund resources. It is a member of the
Eastern Caribbean Currency Union (ECCU), which has a common central bank, the Eastern
Caribbean Central Bank (ECCB). The common currency, the EC dollar, has been pegged to
the U.S. dollar at the rate of EC$2.70 since July 1976. St. Kitts and Nevis has accepted the
obligations of Article VIII, Sections 2, 3, and 4 of the Articles of Agreement. The exchange
system is free of restrictions on the making of payments and transfers for current
international transactions, apart from an indicative limit on travel allowances for which bona
fide requests continue to be approved.
Relations with the World Bank Group. The country assistance strategy (CAS) for
FY06−09 supports the region’s development through: (1) stimulating growth and improving
competitiveness; and (2) reducing vulnerability. The current CAS does not include any
lending to St. Kitts and Nevis under the base case scenario. There are three active projects in
St. Kitts and Nevis with a commitment of US$9.6 million of which US$1.6 million has been
disbursed: (i) Telecommunications and ICT Development Project, approved on May 12,
2005, to improve the access, quality, and use of telecommunications and ICT services;
(ii) Education Development Project approved in June 2003, to increase equitable access to
secondary education and improve the quality of the teaching and learning processes; and
(iii) HIV/AIDS Prevention and Control Program, approved in Jan 2003.
Relations with the Caribbean Development Bank. The CDB has approved loans of
US$146.1 million, of which US$114.2 million has bee disbursed. Major projects under
implementation include: a basic education project; road projects; loans to NEVLEC (Nevis
Electricity Company),and for natural disaster management. Discussions are at an advanced
stage on a policy based loan and a project for the commercialization of the electricity
department.
Statistical issues. St. Kitts and Nevis has participated in the General Data Dissemination
System since October 2000 and its metadata are posted on the Fund’s Dissemination
Standards Bulletin Board. There are significant weaknesses in real, fiscal, and balance of
payments data. Data on GDP by type of expenditure are not available at constant prices,
while the data at current prices are not reliable due to weaknesses in estimating gross capital
formation. A new CPI with weights from the 2000 household survey has been introduced.
There are no data on labor market developments. Fiscal data are not reported for publication
in IFS. The latest data published in the GFS Yearbook are for 2003 (only). No data are
available on the nonfinancial public sector. Data on external trade (especially exports) are not
comprehensive, as they omit important categories of goods. Most components of the
financial account also need improvement. There are no data on private external debt.

N/A

St. Kitts and Nevis is a member of the Eastern Caribbean Central Bank (ECCB), which
manages monetary policy and the exchange system for its eight members. The common
currency, the Eastern Caribbean dollar, has been pegged to the U.S. dollar at the rate of
EC$2.70 per U.S. dollar since July 1976. In practice the ECCB has operated like a quasicurrency board, maintaining foreign exchange backing of its currency and demand liabilities
of close to 100 percent. St. Kitts and Nevis accepted the obligations of Article VIII,
Sections 2, 3, and 4 in December 1984. The exchange system is free of restrictions on the
making of payments and transfers for current international transactions, apart from an
indicative limit on travel allowances for which bona fide requests continue to be approved.

X.

Safeguards Assessment:

Under the Fund's safeguards assessment policy, the Eastern Caribbean Central Bank (ECCB),
of which St. Kitts and Nevis is a participating government, is subject to a full safeguards
assessment. The onsite safeguards assessment was completed on February 20, 2003, and
concluded that the ECCB has in place appropriate mechanisms to manage resources,
including Fund disbursements and that the vulnerabilities that remain do not present an
undue risk. The safeguards assessment proposed specific measures to address these
vulnerabilities, which have been substantially implemented by the ECCB.
XI.

Last Article IV Consultation:

St. Kitts and Nevis is on the standard 12-month consultation cycle. The last Article IV
consultation was concluded by the Executive Board on December 21, 2005.
XII.

FSAP Participation, ROSCs, and OFC Assessment

St. Kitts and Nevis participated in the regional ECCU FSAP conducted in September and
October 2003. The Financial System Stability Assessment is IMF Country Report No.
04/293. A review of St. Kitts and Nevis AML/CFT Assessment was conducted by a team of
assessors representing the Caribbean Financial Action Taskforce (CFATF) in September
2003.
XIII. Technical Assistance: (2005–Present)
During 2005 and 2006, St. Kitts and Nevis has benefited from technical assistance in the
areas of tax policy, tax administration, economic statistics, financial supervision and
macroeconomic management, both from IMF headquarters and the Caribbean Regional
Technical Assistance Center (CARTAC).
•

Experts from CARTAC and the IMF’s Statistics Department (STA) advised the
Central Statistics Office on improving the national accounts, and developing exportimport price indices.

•

Experts from CARTAC, the IMF’s Monetary and Capital Markets Department
(MCD), and the IMF’s Legal Department (LEG) advised the authorities on
strengthening financial regulation and supervision, including risk-based supervision.

•

In 2005 and 2006, CARTAC and MCM advised the authorities on developing a
consistent debt management framework.

41
•

CARTAC, the IMF’s Fiscal Affairs Department (FAD) and LEG provided
assistance to improve cash management and tax administration—including
collection enforcement. Assistance has also been provided in Property Tax Reform,
in preparing to move the property tax base from rental value to market value.

•

CARTAC and FAD provided extensive assistance, through frequent expert visits, to
sensitize politicians and technicians from the Ministry of Finance on the Value
Added Tax (VAT). This provided a general explanation on VAT, and the main steps
in its introduction.

•

As part of the Stabilization and Adjustment Technical Assistance Program
(SATAP), St. Kitts and Nevis have benefited from capacity building in the area of
developing and monitoring stabilization programs.

•

CARTAC has provided seminars to develop capacity in macroeconomic analysis
including a course for technicians in the Ministry of Finance on “The
Macroeconomic Impact of the Budget.” In addition, CARTAC provided assistance
in updating macroeconomic projections and the monitoring of performance.

42
Appendix II. St. Kitts and Nevis: Relations with the World Bank Group
(As of September 18, 2006)
The World Bank’s Management presented to its Board the Eastern Caribbean Sub-Region
Country Assistance Strategy (CAS), on September 13, 2005. The World Bank Group’s
strategy for the four years covered by this CAS (FY06–09) supports the sub-region’s
development agenda through two main pillars: (1) stimulating growth and improving
competitiveness; and (2) reducing vulnerability, by promoting greater social inclusion and
strengthening disaster risk management. Recognizing the OECS countries’ weakened
creditworthiness due to high debt ratios, Bank activities will focus on leveraging available
donor grant financing. Following the recommendations of the recently completed growth and
competitiveness study for the OECS, IBRD and IDA support would focus on providing
technical and financial assistance for interventions to support the two main pillars. The CAS
proposes new commitments of US$103.4 million for six borrowing member states of the
Organization of the Eastern Caribbean States (OECS), including St. Kitts and Nevis. Planned
IBRD lending to St. Kitts and Nevis amounts to US$10 million under the high Case lending
scenario.
Projects
There are three active World Bank projects in St. Kitts and Nevis for commitment of
approximately US$9.6 million of which US$1.6 million has been disbursed.
The St. Kitts and Nevis Telecommunications and ICT Development Project, approved on
May 12, 2005, aims at improving the access, quality, and use of telecommunications and ICT
services to achieve socio-economic development in the Organization of Eastern Caribbean
States (OECS). The project has the following four components: Component (1) will
strengthen the national and regional regulatory frameworks and promote additional
competition in the telecommunications sector. Emphasis will be given to capacity building of
Eastern Caribbean Telecommunications Authority (ECTEL) and the National
Telecommunications Regulatory Commissions (NTRCs) by providing them with assistance
to revise the regional and national sector legislation, and develop a modem interconnection
regime. Component (2) will review current universal access policy, create related guidelines,
and provide financial support to establish a Universal Service Fund (USF). Component (3)
will improve growth and competitiveness in ICT-enabled services through utilization of
broadband infrastructure. Component (4) will ensure management and administration of the
overall project.
The St. Kitts and Nevis Education Development Project was approved in June 2003 for
US$5.0 million. The overall objective of this project is to build human capital which, in turn,
will contribute to the diversification of the economy and more sustainable growth. This
objective will be achieved by: (i) increasing equitable access to secondary education;
(ii) improving the quality of the teaching and learning process, with more direct interventions

43
at the school level and a focus on student-centered learning, and (iii) strengthening
management of the sector and governance of schools.
The HIV/AIDS Prevention and Control Program, which was approved in Jan 2003 for
US$4.0 million, is funded under the Multi-Country APL for the Caribbean Region, with the
following objectives: (i) curbing the spread of HIV/AIDS epidemic; (ii) reducing the
morbidity and mortality attributed to HIV/AIDS; (iii) improving the quality of life for
persons living with HIV/AIDS (PLWAs); and (iv) developing a sustainable organizational
and institutional framework for managing the HIV/AIDS epidemic over the longer term.
Economic and Sector Work
Economic and Sector Work: The Bank has, over the past three years, completed a series of
analytical work relating to public expenditure, fiscal and debt sustainability, growth and
competitiveness, the financial sector, public sector management and social protection. The
ongoing dissemination of these reports represents a key instrument for policy dialogue with
the OECS Governments including St. Kitts and Nevis.
In addition, the OECS countries will benefit from ongoing and planned regional studies
including: A Caribbean regional study on Crime and Violence would focus on the impact of
crime on poverty, social cohesion, tourism, investment and migration; a planned pension
reform study will take an in-depth look at social insurance programs in the Caribbean,
focusing in particular on reforms to address the challenges of limited coverage, increasing
dependency ratios and fiscal sustainability; a study on Air Transport Rationalization which
would inter alia, analyze regional air transport route and classify their commercial viability,
evaluate the current air service arrangements, examine the feasibility of entering into “open
skies” arrangements, and assess the impact of direct and indirect taxation on competition and
service; and a study on access to finance which will examine the issues related to access to
finance, particularly for small and medium enterprises in the OECS. The Bank is also
finalizing a Policy Note on Project Fiduciary Management which is aimed at increasing the
efficiency of project implementation in the OECS.

Appendix III. St. Kitts and Nevis—Relations with the
Caribbean Development Bank
(As of October 31, 2006)
The Caribbean Development Bank (CDB) has approved loans totalling US$146.1 million, of which
US$31.9 million are undisbursed.
Major Projects:
1.

Basic Education Project—to assist GOSKN in the provision and maintenance of a more
appropriate learning environment for a greater number of students in the system (including
those with learning disabilities) who are pursuing basic education at primary and secondary
schools; and enhancement of the education system in the areas of management, in particular,
planning, data collection and analysis, student assessment, school management, curriculum
development and pedagogy.

2.

West Basseterre By-Pass Road—to construct approximately 3.8 kilometres of road to relieve
traffic congestion in the city of Basseterre. The proposed road runs to the north of Basseterre
and along the boundary fence of the Robert L. Bradshaw International Airport.

3.

Second Power Project—consists of the installation of a generator of approximate size 2.5MW
and ancillary switchgear and the establishment of an operations facility at the Nevis
Electricity Company Limited (NEVLEC). The project will provide additional generating
capacity to satisfy projected electricity demand and to replace existing engines that are past
their useful life.

4.

Student Loan Scheme (Fifth Loan)—to assist the Development Bank of St Kitts and Nevis
(DBSKN) in financing loans to students attending local, regional and extra-regional
institutions for programmes in technical, vocational and academic studies.

5.

Child Development Project—to provide a comprehensive framework for addressing the care
and protection of children and the reform of juvenile offenders. The project will enhance the
life chances of children in St. Kitts and Nevis by improving their connectedness with the
school system and providing rehabilitative care for those at risk and those who have
committed offences.

6.

Seventh Consolidated Line of Credit—to provide a loan to DBSKN for on-lending for various
objectives including: to promote home ownership and improve existing housing stock; to
develop human resources through the provision of student loans; and to satisfy the needs of
individuals and entities in the productive sectors of the economy.

7.

Natural Disaster Management Project—to contribute to the rehabilitation of economic
infrastructure caused by hurricane Lenny. The project consists of rehabilitating 8.66 metres of
sea defence structures with rock armouring and stone on geo-textile sheeting; reconstruction
of a reinforced concrete ramp; and repairs to other infrastructure and public buildings. The

46
project promotes the reduction of vulnerability to natural disasters through support for the
development and adoption of mitigation policies, standards and practices.

Appendix IV. St. Kitts and Nevis: Statistical Issues
St. Kitts and Nevis has been participating in the General Data Dissemination System (GDDS)
since October 2000 and its metadata are posted on the Fund’s Dissemination Standards
Bulletin Board (DSBB).
1.

Real sector

There are a number of deficiencies in the real sector statistics. Data on GDP broken down by
type of expenditure are not available at constant prices, while the data at current prices are
not reliable due to weaknesses in estimating gross capital formation. Private final
consumption expenditure is estimated as a residual. A new CPI with weights from the 2000
household survey has now been introduced. Monthly CPI data are reported regularly but with
a long lag. Detailed data on tourism arrivals and expenditure have not been forthcoming
since end-2001. No data are currently available on labor market developments. Results of
the 2001 population census are still being analyzed.
2.

Public finances

Data on revenue, expenditure, and financing of the consolidated central government (St. Kitts
and Nevis) are made available to Fund staff on request. There are a number of technical
problems that need to be addressed, including a discrepancy between the overall balance (the
difference between revenues and expenditures) and available financing. Previous missions
have identified this discrepancy as arising from the inability to capture all expenditures, such
as appropriation-in-aid loans and the so-called “below the line” expenditures. The authorities
could benefit from technical assistance in resolving this serious discrepancy and in producing
on a regular basis a set of fully integrated accounts for the central government. Also, it would
be very useful to institute a mechanism for the regular reporting of financial data of the rest
of the public sector and to compile the consolidated accounts of the nonfinancial public
sector. The authorities do not report fiscal data for publication in IFS. The latest data
published in the GFS Yearbook are for 2003 (only).
3.

Balance of payments and external debt

Estimates for St. Kitts and Nevis are currently provided on an annual basis by the Eastern
Caribbean Central Bank (ECCB). The latest data published in IFS are for 2005. Data on
external trade (especially exports) are not comprehensive, as they omit important categories
of goods. Most components of the financial account also need improvement. It would be
useful to reconcile the data on the public sector investment plan for external loans with the
public external debt database. There are no data on private external debt.

48

4.

Money and financial statistics

The monetary and financial statistics based on standardized report forms for St. Kitts and
Nevis are compiled and submitted to the IMF by the ECCB. The 2005 monetary and
financial statistics mission indicated that enhanced institutional coverage, classification of
financial instruments, and sectorization of economic units will have a positive impact on the
identification of credit flows to different sectors of the economy and on the compilation of
monetary aggregates in monetary policy design and implementation. It recommended that the
institutional coverage for other depository corporations be expanded to include credit unions,
finance companies, and building societies, which also accept demand and other deposits.
Further, the mission recommended broadening the coverage to include insurance companies,
pension funds, development banks, offshore institutions and foundations.

Statement by the IMF Staff Representative
January 17, 2007

Subsequent to the issuance of the staff report on 12/21/06, the 2007 budgets have been
presented in both St Kitts and Nevis. The new information does not alter the thrust of the staff
appraisal.
1.
The staff estimates that the 2007 budgets for St. Kitts and Nevis would imply a
primary surplus of the central government of about 5 percent of GDP. Assuming a
historical implementation rate for capital expenditure and receipt of grants, the primary
surplus is estimated to be about 1 percent of GDP below the staff’s “active scenario”
(Table 1). Key components of the budgets include:
•

Current expenditures are expected to continue to decline relative to GDP. The
composition of expenditures has shifted to provide increased allocations for security
and to provide new training opportunities to enable the local population to benefit
from the Caribbean Single Market. A new Finance Administration Act will be
implemented to strengthen budget control.

•

Debt management operations—including floating a new bond in the first half of 2007
to retire more expensive loans—are anticipated to generate interest savings.

•

Capital expenditure—planned at more than 10 percent of GDP, but estimated by staff
based on historical implementation rates at 6¼ percent of GDP—reflect ongoing
projects to improve roads on both St. Kitts and on Nevis, additional investments in
the electricity sector, an Information and Communication Technology center, and
projects to facilitate development of new agricultural opportunities.

•

Modernization of the tax system is underway, including moving the Property Tax to a
market valuation basis, amending the corporate income tax, and preparation for the
introduction of the value-added tax.

•

The deficit is to be financed, in part, by a new policy-based loan from the Caribbean
Development Bank as well as land sales.

2.

The budgets also addressed the broader reform agenda:

•

1,200 acres of land are to be sold in order to assist in retiring the sugar debt. Sales
will be consistent with the new Physical Development Plan, with priority to be given
to nationals. Modalities for the land sales are under development.

•

A contributory pension scheme for civil servants has been introduced. Established
civil servants who are not yet vested in the current scheme (those with less than
ten years of service) will not be provided with a noncontributory pension.

2

•

The new Finance Administration Act will enhance oversight over public corporations
and statutory bodies.

•

To improve the investment climate, an Investment Promotion Agency (IPA) focused
on small- and medium-sized businesses will become operational in early 2007. The
IPA will function as a one-stop shop for investors, providing a single transparent
source of information on regulations and licensing.

Public Information Notice (PIN) No. 07/42
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
March 27, 2007

International Monetary Fund
700 19th Street, NW
Washington, D. C. 20431 USA

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2006 Article IV Consultation with
St. Kitts and Nevis
On January 17, 2007, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded
the Article IV consultation with St. Kitts and Nevis.1
Background
In July 2005, the sugar industry—the historical mainstay of the economy—closed after more
than 300 years. The industry had incurred substantial losses—on the order of 3–4 percent of
GDP annually in the last several years—even before the announced further cut in preferential
access to the EU market. The closure has required the government to service the debt of the
sugar company (about 29 percent of GDP). Public debt, accumulated as a result of exogenous
shocks (including three hurricanes in the second half of the 1990s) and an accommodative
policy stance, reached 190 percent of GDP at end-2005.
Despite the closure of the sugar industry, economic growth has accelerated. In 2006, the
economy is estimated to have recorded its third consecutive year of strong growth, projected
at 4½ percent in 2006, with good prospects for 2007 due to the combination of ongoing
construction projects and activity related to the Cricket World Cup. While the current account
deficit remains large (at 25 percent of GDP in 2005), it has been mainly financed by foreign
direct investment, and competitiveness appears to be improving—partly owing to the
depreciation of the U.S. dollar against major currencies. Large adjustments in the regulated
prices for petroleum and electricity prices in response to the higher global prices for petroleum,
created a temporary spike in inflation during 2005–06.
1

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On
return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the
Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the
Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the
country's authorities.

2

Fiscal imbalances have improved significantly, reflecting both policy adjustments and
continued growth. The central government primary surplus is estimated at 6 percent of GDP in
2006, a significant turnaround from the small primary deficit recorded in 2004. Policy
adjustments include increasing revenue effort based on administrative reforms that enhanced
compliance and containing noninterest expenditures.
Despite the fiscal adjustment, public sector debt remains at a very high level. While the central
government accounts have strengthened significantly, public enterprises are contracting
significant debt. The large gross financing needs of the government have been met by
increased reliance on domestic financing sources.
Monetary aggregates have continued to grow in line with economic growth. Private credit has
rebounded, rising by about 8 percent in 2005, and is projected to increase by more than
10 percent in 2006. The approval of the revisions to the uniform Banking Act has strengthened
the regulatory basis for the banking system. Further progress has also been made in
improving the supervision and the regulation of the Anti-Money Laundering/Combating the
Financing of Terrorism framework to reflect ongoing changes in the financial system.
Executive Board Assessment
Directors welcomed the improvement in economic outcomes and prospects achieved over the
last few years, with recent growth driven largely by tourism and construction. To develop more
sustainable sources of growth, Directors recommended strengthening the business and
investment climate and improving competitiveness, including by enhancing the efficiency and
reliability of public utilities.
The authorities’ ambitious fiscal consolidation program has already resulted in the central
government achieving a strong primary surplus. Nevertheless, greater efforts to prioritize and
control government expenditure are needed to sustain the fiscal adjustment.
The transparency, accountability, monitoring, and oversight of public enterprises need to be
improved, to ensure that the central government’s fiscal consolidation is not undermined by the
poor financial performance of public entities. Directors welcomed the authorities’ commitment
to reform the tax system to improve its efficiency, but emphasized that for the reform to be
successful it will need to be supported by improvements in administrative capacity.
Even with full implementation of the authorities’ consolidation strategy, the public debt stock
will remain very high for many years. Directors emphasized the importance of exploring
options for a more rapid reduction of the debt-to-GDP ratio, including by accelerating the pace
of asset sales and strengthening debt management. They stressed that a social consensus in
favor of fiscal consolidation needs to be nurtured and strengthened, even as expenditure
pressures related to population aging grow.

3
Reducing financial sector risks, including in nonbank financial institutions, needs to be given
high priority. Directors called for additional progress in making effective the single regulatory
unit and in approving supporting legislation.
Directors observed that St. Kitts and Nevis’s high vulnerability to natural disasters and shocks
to tourism highlights the importance of precautionary measures and contingency planning.
Directors welcomed the recent enhancements in the statistical database, but called for further
efforts to improve the reliability and timeliness of key data, including on tourism, debt, and
public enterprises.

Public Information Notices (PINs) form part of the IMF's efforts to promote transparency of the IMF's
views and analysis of economic developments and policies. With the consent of the country
(or countries) concerned, PINs are issued after Executive Board discussions of Article IV consultations
with member countries, of its surveillance of developments at the regional level, of post-program
monitoring, and of ex post assessments of member countries with longer-term program engagements.
PINs are also issued after Executive Board discussions of general policy matters, unless otherwise
decided by the Executive Board in a particular case.
