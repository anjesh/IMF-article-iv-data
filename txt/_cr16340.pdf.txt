IMF Executive Board Concludes Article IV Consultation with Cambodia
On October 19, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded the
2016 Article IV consultation with Cambodia.1
Cambodia is a fast-growing, highly open economy, and attained lower-middle income status this
year. The Cambodian economy grew at around 7 percent in 2015, supported by strong garments
exports, real estate and construction activity as well as the reduction in oil prices. Inflation
unexpectedly picked up at end-2015 to 2.8 percent due to higher food prices resulting from
extreme weather, but it remains well contained. Private sector credit growth has averaged nearly
30 percent (year-on-year) over the past three years, doubling the credit-to-GDP ratio to
62 percent by end-2015, which exceeds the median emerging market level and is double the
median low-income country level.
The current account deficit (CAD) narrowed to 10.6 percent of GDP in 2015, and is largely
financed by FDI and official flows. Gross official reserves rose to US$ 5.3 billion at end-2015,
more than 4 months of prospective imports. The fiscal deficit narrowed to 1.6 percent of GDP in
2015, below the budget target, as the result of stronger-than-expected revenue growth, owing to
improved revenue administration.
The near-term outlook remains broadly favorable. Growth is projected to remain robust at around
7 percent for 2016–17, supported by strong garments exports, real estate and construction
activity, notwithstanding weaker agricultural and tourism growth. Medium-term growth is
projected to decline to around 6.3 percent by 2021, due to a moderation in the credit cycle and
challenges in economic diversification. The current account deficit (CAD) is projected to narrow
to 9.7 percent of GDP in 2016, due to reduced imports following the completion of major hydro
projects, low commodity prices and growing remittances. Over the medium-term, the CAD is
forecast to decline to around 8.5 percent of GDP.

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with members, usually
every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial information, and discusses with officials
the country's economic developments and policies. On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which
forms the basis for discussion by the Executive Board.

2

The outlook is subject to substantial downside risks. Rapid credit growth, along with growing
concentration in real estate, poses heightened risks to financial and macroeconomic stability.
External risks include a significant slowdown in China, U.S. dollar appreciation, structurally
weaker growth in Europe coupled with increased uncertainty from the Brexit referendum result,
and a sharper-than-anticipated tightening in global financial conditions.
Executive Board Assessment2
Directors welcomed Cambodia’s robust economic growth over the last two decades, which has
resulted in an impressive decline in poverty and the country’s successful transition to a
lower-middle income status. Directors noted that while the growth outlook remains strong, the
economy faces downside risks stemming from rapid credit growth, fiscal pressures, and possible
spillovers from an uncertain external environment. They recommended that policies ahead
should focus on securing sustained growth and mitigating financial sector vulnerabilities,
including by enhancing resilience and building buffers.
Directors considered the current fiscal stance to be appropriate and commended the
improvements in tax administration, which helped increase revenue and accumulate government
deposits in the banking system. To sustain these gains, they encouraged modernization of tax
policy and further efforts to strengthen revenue administration. Directors also advised that future
increases in public wages should be fiscally sustainable and accompanied by continued civil
service reform. They recommended curtailing non-development current spending and saving
excess revenues in the event of overperformance. In addition, Directors encouraged the
authorities to develop a medium-term fiscal framework, improve expenditure allocation
efficiency, as well as strengthen the monitoring of contingent liabilities, particularly from
public-private partnerships.
Directors welcomed the steps being taken to bolster financial stability, noting the recent
institution of the liquidity coverage ratio and minimum capital requirements. They highlighted
that stronger efforts will be needed to achieve a soft landing of the credit cycle and safeguard
macro-financial stability. Directors underscored that well-coordinated policy measures, including
raising reserve requirements, putting in place macroprudential measures, and strengthening
micro-prudential regulations will help moderate the pace of credit growth and bolster financial
stability. In addition, they encouraged upgrading and tightening of prudential regulations on
large deposit-taking micro-finance institutions to match those of banks. Developing a crisis
management framework will also be important going forward.

At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the Board, summarizes the views of
Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the country's authorities. An explanation of any qualifiers
used in summings up can be found here: http://www.imf.org/external/np/sec/misc/qualifiers.htm.

Directors welcomed the policies to promote financial market development, particularly
improvements in the negotiable certificates of deposits market. They considered that further
progress in developing an interbank market is important for laying the groundwork for
market-based monetary policy operations. They also recommended policies to promote
de-dollarization and accelerate broader financial market development.
Directors encouraged the authorities to step up their efforts to boost competitiveness and
promote economic diversification. Reducing the cost of doing business will help enhance
competitiveness and foster diversification and inclusiveness. Directors highlighted that lowering
energy costs, upgrading infrastructure, addressing skills bottlenecks, as well as strengthening
transparency will also contribute to fostering inclusive and sustained growth.

STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2016 ARTICLE IV CONSULTATION
September 28, 2016

KEY ISSUES
Context. Growth remains strong supported by robust garments exports, real estate
and construction activity. Inflation has increased slightly due to higher food prices.
Rapid credit growth, along with growing concentration in real estate, poses
heightened risks to financial and macroeconomic stability. External risks include a
significant slowdown in China, U.S. dollar appreciation, structurally-weaker growth in
Europe coupled with increased uncertainty from the Brexit referendum result, and a
sharper-than-anticipated tightening in global financial conditions.
Main Policy Recommendations
Policies should focus on securing sustained growth and mitigating growing financial
sector vulnerabilities, including by enhancing resilience and building buffers
preemptively. Key elements of the policy strategy should include:


Monetary and financial sector: Mitigating macro-financial risks by engineering a
soft landing of the credit cycle and building capital and liquidity buffers using a
well-sequenced set of micro- and macro-prudential policy tools, developing a
crisis management framework, and continued upgrading of regulation and
supervision.



Fiscal policy: Maintaining fiscal sustainability and supporting development by
further boosting revenues (by modernizing revenue administration and tax
policy), while developing a medium-term fiscal framework to facilitate more
strategic allocation of resources.



Structural policy: Increasing competitiveness and encouraging diversification
through lowering energy costs, improving human capital and infrastructure, and
strengthening the rule of law and transparency to reduce business costs and
uncertainty.



Exchange rate policy and market development: Develop money and foreign
exchange markets to promote de-dollarization and support implementation of an
effective monetary framework. This would allow gradually increasing exchange
rate flexibility, which would help respond to external shocks.

CONTEXT
1.
Context. Cambodia is a fast-growing, highly open economy, and attained lower-middle
income status this year. Over the last two decades, Cambodia grew rapidly (average real GDP
growth of around 8 percent) and its integration with the global economy increased sharply,
accompanied by an impressive decline in poverty. Going forward, Cambodia’s strategic location,
China’s changing trade patterns, and ongoing regional integration provide further opportunities.1
Important steps have been taken by the government that will help Cambodia capitalize on these
opportunities, including energy-related investments to help reduce the cost of doing business and
measures to facilitate trade, payments and business registration. Nonetheless, further measures are
needed to support sustained growth, including reforms to improve the business climate and policies
to mitigate rising financial sector vulnerabilities.
2.
Past Fund advice. Policies have generally been in line with past Fund advice, but
implementation should be accelerated in key areas. Consistent with past Fund recommendations,
the authorities are implementing the Revenue Mobilization Strategy (RMS) and improving revenue
administration, and strengthening public financial management. The National Bank of Cambodia
(NBC) recently introduced the Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR) to improve liquidity regulation, and
raised minimum capital requirements to build capital buffers. Going forward, the key policy focus
should be to secure sustained growth and mitigate growing financial sector vulnerabilities, along
with continuing efforts to meet the sustainable development goals and promote inclusion.

DEVELOPMENTS, OUTLOOK, AND RISKS
3.
Growth and inflation. The economy grew at 7 percent in 2015, supported by strong
garments exports, real estate and construction activity, as well as the reduction in oil prices,
notwithstanding weaker agricultural and tourism growth.2 Growth is projected to remain robust at
7 percent for 2016–17. Medium-term growth is projected to decline to around 6¼ percent by 2021,
due to a moderation in the credit cycle and challenges in economic diversification. To sustain
growth at around 7 percent and above (through 2021), expeditious implementation of business
climate reforms coupled with targeted investments, particularly in agriculture and transportation
infrastructure, as well as measures to protect financial stability are needed (Box 1). Inflation
unexpectedly picked up at end-2015 to 2.8 percent due to higher food prices resulting from
extreme weather, and is projected to rise modestly to 3.2 percent by end 2016.

2 Garment exports, accounting for 74 percent of exports, grew at around 15 percent (y/y) in 2015, which was above
expectations, despite exchange rate appreciation and weak trading partner growth (particularly in the EU).

Credit cycle. Credit growth has been rapid,
leading to one of the fastest financial deepening
episodes by historical cross-country standards.
Private sector credit growth has averaged nearly
30 percent (year-on-year) over the past three years,
doubling the credit-to-GDP ratio to 62 percent by
end-2015, which exceeds the median emerging
market level and is double the median low-income
country (LIC) level. While credit to the manufacturing
and agricultural sectors slowed, real estate and
mortgage lending continue to grow rapidly,
averaging 50 percent in 2015 and H1 2016. Broad
money growth slowed as deposit growth fell to
19 percent in the first half of 2016, from 25 percent
in the first half of 2015. Banks are relying more on
foreign borrowing to maintain credit growth, and
the average loan-to-deposit (LTD) ratio reached
108.5 percent in June 2016, from 79 percent in 2010.
The financial system remains highly dollarized, with
foreign currency deposits constituting 95 percent of
total deposits.

5.
External sector outlook. The current
account deficit (CAD) is projected to narrow to 10.2 percent of GDP in 2016, from 10.6 percent in
2015, due to reduced imports following the completion of major hydro projects, low commodity
prices and growing remittances. Over the medium-term, the CAD is forecast to decline to around
8½ percent of GDP, as major power projects are completed (and related imports decline), exports
and tourism grow (aided by an expansion of US GSP access for specific travel-related items) with
some product diversification amid ASEAN Economic Community integration. Indeed, recent FDI
trends point to early signs of diversification into other manufacturing products as regional
producers attempt to diversify their supply chains. FDI and official sector flows are expected to
continue financing the CAD over the medium-term. Gross official reserves are projected to increase
to US$6.3 billion as of end-2016 (around 4½ months of total imports) and to continue rising over
the medium term.
6.
External sector assessment and policies. Based on the IMF’s External Balance Assessmentlite methodology, the external position is assessed to be moderately weaker than suggested by
fundamentals and desirable policies (Box 2). The moderate overvaluation of the real effective
exchange rate (REER), in the absence of an independent exchange rate regime, calls for policies to
improve productivity and competitiveness.3 Measured against traditional metrics, reserves appear to

managed” arrangement.

be adequate; however, there are benefits to building reserves further given high dollarization and
elevated financial vulnerabilities. The current exchange rate regime, based on keeping the riel
broadly stable against the U.S. dollar, is appropriate given high dollarization and a concentration in
U.S. dollar-invoiced exports (primarily garments). Over time, as dollarization declines, capacity
improves, and the economy diversifies, gradually introducing greater exchange rate flexibility is
recommended to better absorb external shocks and enable implementation of an independent
monetary policy.
7.

Risks. The outlook is subject to downside risks:


External risks: A significant slowdown in China would spill over through the FDI, banking
and tourism channels (Box 3). A surge in the US dollar and/or weaker growth in Europe
could constrain garments exports, particularly amid stiff competition from other low-cost
producers (see Appendix I, Risk Assessment Matrix). In the near term, the Brexit referendum
result is not expected to have a large direct impact on Cambodian exports (despite
Cambodia's trade export exposure to the UK being the highest in the ASEAN at close to
6 percent of GDP) due to UK-bound Cambodian exports being relatively income inelastic. A
more important headwind for Cambodian exports could be the increasing redirection of new
garment orders to Vietnam as a result of the TPP agreement, which would lead to declining
FDI growth in the Cambodian garment sector. Also, sharper-than-anticipated tightening in
global financial conditions could raise funding costs and heighten liquidity risks for
Cambodian banks and MFIs, which have become increasingly reliant on foreign funding.



Macro-financial risks. Rising financial sector vulnerabilities amid a credit boom pose
significant risks to macro-financial stability.


Several macroeconomic shocks may adversely affect the financial system.
 Macroeconomic shocks could potentially lead to a funding squeeze and result in
a credit crunch. Possible shocks include a sharper-than-anticipated global
liquidity tightening, and a significant slowdown in China.
 A sharp slowdown in economic growth could lead to an increase in bad loans in
specific sectors (e.g. slower-than-expected growth in the EU and China can affect
garments exports and construction).



Vulnerabilities in certain banks or MFIs and in the real estate market may lead to a
financial system-wide shock, which could spill over to the macro economy.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

CAMBODIA

 Growing oversupply in the real-estate sector could trigger a disorderly price
correction.4 This in turn could lead to rising defaults (as collateral values fall) and a
spike in NPLs, which would pose a drag on credit growth and economic activity.


Other domestic risks include fiscal pressures and the erosion of competitiveness from wage
hikes potentially outstripping productivity increases.



Upside risks. Faster structural reforms and efforts to slow credit and channel it to more
productive sectors will lead to faster and more durable growth over the medium term
(Box 1).



Policy response. Policy options in case financial sector risks materialize are limited in view of
high dollarization and a lack of monetary instruments, as well as the projected lack of fiscal
space over the medium term. There is a need to build up the crisis management framework
by bolstering the financial safety net, including instituting deposit insurance, putting in place
a robust bank resolution framework, and strengthening the lender of last resort function of
the NBC.

Authorities’ views. The authorities broadly shared staff’s assessment of the outlook and
risks. Over the medium term, they also project growth to fall absent further diversification. They had
a similar assessment of macro-financial risks and emphasized their plans to mitigate them, while
closely monitoring the impact on growth. They expressed concerns regarding spillovers from EU
growth on garment exports, while noting that Brexit and Vietnam’s inclusion in the TPP agreement
were unlikely to hurt exports (and FDI) significantly over the next few years, but could weigh on
medium-term prospects. To support exports, a short-term priority for the government is to expand
US GSP access to other garments. The authorities considered minimum wage negotiations, rather
than further appreciation of the U.S. dollar, as the biggest near-term risk to competitiveness. Reserve
accumulation in 2016 thus far has exceeded the authorities’ expectations, and is projected to remain
strong for the rest of the year.

KEY POLICY ISSUES
9.
The key policy challenges are to secure sustained growth and mitigate growing
financial sector vulnerabilities. Along with building resilience, efforts are needed to meet the
sustainable development goals and promote inclusion. Policy efforts should focus on: (i) containing
growing macro-financial risks, (ii) maintaining fiscal sustainability, (iii) boosting competitiveness and
diversification, and (iv) expediting financial market development.
10.
Policy strategy. In view of rising financial sector vulnerabilities and elevated external risks,
macroeconomic policies should be tightened to secure buffers, notwithstanding low debt levels.
Fiscal policy should continue focusing on boosting revenues and rationalizing expenditure to
maintain fiscal sustainability, amid rising wage pressures and needed capital and development
spending, and to ensure sufficient fiscal buffers. Financial sector policies should focus on securing a
soft landing of the credit cycle and building capital and liquidity buffers, using a well-coordinated
and sequenced set of micro- and macroprudential policy tools, as well as upgrading regulation and
supervision. Finally, structural reforms should be geared towards promoting diversification,
enhancing competitiveness, and improving the business climate, to secure inclusive and sustained
growth.

A. Containing Growing Macro-Financial Risks
11.
Excessive credit growth. The duration of the current credit boom, which began at around
end-2011, significantly exceeds the average length of past
credit booms, leading to the buildup of financial stability
risks. Credit growth is projected to remain high at around
25 percent over 2016–17, moderating only slightly due to
tightening global financial conditions and the imposition
of tighter liquidity regulations and higher capital
requirements. This would result in an already-high
credit/GDP ratio to continue rising sharply (to over
80 percent by 2017). The credit-to-GDP gap (a widely used

cross-country indicator of potential crises/banking stress), which by end 2015 had already exceeded
the pre-crisis peak reached in 2008, is projected to breach the 10-percent threshold by end 2017.5
Credit intensity of growth has trended up to 3.8 in 2015 from 3 in 2011–14 (average), implying that
credit is becoming less efficient in generating growth and investment.6 Over the medium term,
sustaining high economic growth and avoiding financial instability will require decisively moderating
the pace of credit growth.7

Intensifying credit risk in real estate. Real
estate market expansion has continued unabated,
with new construction permits continuing to rise.
While credit growth has been broad-based, there is
growing concentration in the real estate sector,
leading to rising credit risk linked to asset prices.
Rapid construction could eventually lead to an oversupply in the real estate market (especially for
condominiums), which risks precipitating a large
disorderly adjustment in real estate prices, adversely
impacting the banking sector and economic
activity.8

Credit-to-GDP gap is considered a leading indicator for financial sector stress or crises or a sharp growth slowdown.
Following the BIS methodology, a threshold of 10 percent is considered a strong signal of an impending crisis
(Drehman and others, 2010). The credit gap discussed here is based on the HP filter, and is at the lower bound of the
range of estimates.

Credit intensity is defined as nominal credit growth divided by nominal GDP growth.

Dell’Ariccia and others (2012) found that while it is difficult to tell “bad” from “good” credit booms, bad booms tend to
be larger and last longer. Roughly half of the booms lasting longer than six years ended in a severe financial downturn.
7

There is currently no official housing data, which poses serious challenges to analyzing the link between housing
boom and credit boom. There is also limited data on household balance sheets and leverage. Data from a real estate
agency suggests that Phnom Penh’s land price for residential and office space increased 26 percent and 19 percent,
respectively, year-on-year in 2015; the highest growth among Asian cities. Since 95 percent of loans in Cambodia are
collateralized against land, a negative shock in the real estate sector could put more debtors in negative equity,
which in turn could prompt rising defaults and fire sales.

13.
Increasing reliance on foreign funding.
The banking sector has increased its reliance on
foreign borrowing, further raising structurally high
liquidity risks. The average LTD ratio reached
108.5 percent in June 2016 (20 banks with LTD ratios
over 100 percent, and 14 banks over 200 percent).
14.
Rising risks from the nonbank sector.
Microfinance institutions (MFIs) are now playing a
systemic role, with credit stock and flows from MFIs
at 20 and 25 percent, respectively, of those in the
banking system. A number of MFIs are now larger than some mid-sized commercial banks and accept
deposits, thereby competing for the same client base while being subject to looser regulations.9
Moreover, large deposit-taking MFIs are heavily reliant on foreign funding, even more so than banks.

rendering many banks vulnerable to liquidity risks.
16.
Containing growing financial risks. Cognizant of growing financial risks, the NBC has
recently taken a number of pre-emptive steps to enhance the resilience of the financial system.
Liquidity regulations have been strengthened by introducing a Basel-III compliant Liquidity
Coverage Ratio (to be met by September 2016), and while it is too early to assess the impact, this
regulation is expected to dent credit momentum and help build buffers against liquidity shocks. The
MFIs are expanding loans at a faster pace to maintain growth targets and average loan size has risen sharply. Also,
more than 20 percent of MFI customers have multiple loans, which is partly due to the highly-saturated MFI industry
and the ensuing competition.

NBC has also raised minimum capital requirements in March 2016 (to be in full effect in two years).10
The NBC’s plans to impose bank-specific prudential measures on institutions deemed to be
engaged in excessive risk-taking is welcome. While these efforts are to be commended, further
measures are needed to ensure financial stability. Therefore, the NBC should follow through on their
plans to adopt a liquidity risk management framework in 2016, improve regulations on asset
classification and provisioning, and refine the solvency ratio during 2017. Also, while supervisory
capacity has improved, further efforts are required to close gaps in financial supervision.11 The
government has recently tightened licensing and supervision on real estate developers, and
improved the efficiency and expanded the coverage of stamp duty on real estate transactions. These
measures are welcome and should be used more actively going forward as an additional countercyclical policy tool to help manage the real estate cycle.
17.
Policy recommendations. The following policy measures are recommended to encourage
financial institutions to build resilience and engineer a soft landing of the credit cycle. To this end, a
range of tools should be implemented and coordinated among multiple government agencies in a
well-designed and sequenced way. The recommended sequencing of specific measures is contained
in the table on page 12.


Raise reserve requirements (RR). RR should be raised, particularly on short-term foreign
currency deposits and foreign borrowing. This would also increase the size of NBC’s liquidity
buffer that can be promptly released should liquidity conditions unexpectedly tighten.



Strengthen microprudential policies. The NBC should revisit loan classification, align
provisioning rules with international best practices, improve asset classification regulation, and
ensure that rules are consistently enforced by banks, particularly focusing on sound
underwriting standards and prudent valuations.12 Capital adequacy regulations, which are based
on Basel I, need to be upgraded to ensure financial institutions have adequate buffers
commensurate with their risk profiles.



Put in place a comprehensive crisis management framework. First, the NBC should strengthen
the existing prompt corrective action framework to enable it to take early action.13 Second, building
on the memorandum of understanding (MOU) signed by the NBC, the Ministry of Economy and
Finance (MEF), and the Securities and Exchange Commission of Cambodia (SECC) in 2014, the crisis

Minimum capital requirements for commercial banks were raised from $37.5 million to $75 million, and for
deposit-taking MFIs from $2.5 million to $30 million.
10

11 The discrepancies are attributable to both the limited number and technical capabilities of supervisors. Capacity
building efforts are thus crucial, and the NBC has requested IMF assistance in a number of areas.

The regulations should provide more detailed guidance on the treatment of restructured loans. For instance, a
bank should be required to limit the number of times an individual loan may be restructured, formally agree on new
terms of agreement with borrowers, and have in place policies and procedures approved by the Board. Restructured
loans should also attract a higher risk weight under the capital adequacy framework reflecting a higher probability of
default. Many of these minimum standards did not appear to be in place or observed by the banks.
12

As a first step, the NBC should consider introducing triggers for domestic systematically important banks with
regard to asset quality and liquidity position, in addition to existing legal triggers on the regulatory minimum for
solvency ratio, for prompt corrective action.
13

10

management framework should provide a sound institutional arrangement with more explicit interagency coordination mechanisms, including the exchange of information, contingency planning,
and reforms to the legal framework in line with 2010 FSAP recommendations.


Introduce macroprudential policies. (i) Sectoral tools: imposing sectoral concentration limits
and/or higher risk weights for real-estate loans should be considered. Collection of real-estate
data and household balance sheets should be expedited to enable the introduction of limits on
debt-to-income ratio and loan-to-value ratios; (ii) Liquidity tools: funding requirements such as
limits on LTD ratios would ensure that banks hold more internal and stable liabilities, and can
also serve as an effective brake on excessive credit growth; (iii) Capital tools: counter cyclical
capital requirements (tailored to Cambodia) could be implemented to build buffers in the
financial system, which can be drawn upon in a downturn.



Strengthen non-bank regulation. The growing systemic relevance of large MFIs calls for
strengthening regulation to prevent regulatory arbitrage (Box 4). Specifically, (i) revising the
capital adequacy regulations, (ii) standardizing asset classification in line with banks, (iii) raising
RR, and (iv) better monitoring of systemic linkages between MFIs and banks.



Implement complementary prudential measures. A coordinated policy response across
government agencies, complementing actions taken by the NBC, is recommended to moderate
rapid credit growth and contain rising financial stability risks. Well-designed and targeted fiscal
measures, such as stamp duties and a capital gains tax, to augment the monetary prudential
measures taken by the NBC, could be deployed to more decisively dampen excessive real estate
price inflation. Such measures are especially useful when the real estate cycle is being driven by
capital inflows that bypass the domestic banking system.

18.
Authorities’ views. The authorities broadly agreed with staff’s assessment and highlighted
their efforts to incorporate staff’s previous recommendations. They agreed that there is a need to
engineer a soft landing of the credit cycle, including by focusing on strengthening regulation and
improving institutional capacity. They noted that in addition to the speed of credit growth, they are
closely monitoring the quality of credit and the sectoral allocation of credit with the objective of
increasing credit to productive sectors. The authorities also broadly agreed with staff’s proposed
sequencing of financial sector policy recommendations, though they noted that the exact timing of
additional measures would be contingent upon the assessment of past measures and the impact on
credit growth and economic activity. The NBC has implemented microprudential and macroprudential
measures such as reserve requirements on non-resident borrowings, liquidity coverage ratio and
increase in minimum registered capital. The NBC has already started working on revising regulations
on asset classification and provisioning, as well as on the prompt corrective action framework, and
plans to upgrade solvency regulation. To curb credit, it is considering introducing targeted bank-bybank level regulation. The NBC has launched a Financial Literacy Program to help support financial
stability. Finally, the authorities highlighted progress in strengthening crisis preparedness, as the MEF
and SECC have recently established financial stability working groups to improve information sharing,
and have committed to set up, together with the NBC, a national financial stability committee that will
establish a crisis management framework and strengthen financial stability oversight.

B. Maintaining Fiscal Sustainability
19.
Fiscal outlook in 2016. The fiscal deficit is projected to widen to 2.6 percent of GDP (but
remain below the budget target) from 1.6 percent of GDP in 2015 as rising current expenditure is
expected to more than offset revenue mobilization efforts.14 Strong revenue performance, following
the 2014 adoption of the government’s RMS, is

Government deposits are projected to be

adequate. In view of impending spending pressures over the medium term, any revenue overperformance should be saved and non-development current expenditure curtailed, by continuing to
enhance spending efficiency.
20.
2017 Preliminary budget. In the preliminary 2017 budget, the government plans to target
a budget deficit of 2.6 percent of GDP. On the revenue side, the budget envisages a 0.5 percent of
GDP increase in tax revenues owing to improvements in tax administration and compliance. On the
spending side, the budget includes a 0.4 percent of GDP increase in the wage bill to 7.4 percent of
GDP. Spending on social protection and pensions will also rise (by about 1 percent of GDP). Plans to
increase social spending and growth-enhancing capital spending are welcome. However, revenue
projections appear optimistic, and staff projects lower revenue growth and a higher fiscal deficit.
21.
Medium-term fiscal pressures. Over the medium term, strong revenue administration
efforts (based on RMS implementation) are expected to continue to boost revenues, but the pace of

The 2015 fiscal deficit (-1.6 percent of GDP) was much smaller than the budget target of -4.2 percent of GDP, due
to robust revenue growth, following the implementation of the RMS.
14

Initiated in late 2012, the RMS focuses on strengthening revenue administration, revenue policy and the institutional
framework in order to continue raising domestic revenue by at least ½ percent of GDP annually over the medium term.
Improved tax administration includes enhanced taxpayer registration, filing support, auditing, and arrears management.
For customs, the focus is on strengthening clearance processes (customs declaration, risk management, and audit) and
cross border control (smuggling, valuation). On revenue policy, the RMS focuses on excises, VAT, widening the tax base,
rationalizing tax incentives and holidays, and imposing property taxes.
15

In late 2014, the government pledged to raise the civil servants’ minimum monthly wage to US$250 by 2018 from
about US$100 in 2013/14, matching the opposition’s campaign promise.

revenue gains is expected to moderate.17 Recent revenue increases relied heavily on strengthened
auditing, which while welcome, should be accompanied by institutional improvements to sustain
revenue performance.18 Furthermore, revenue performance could disappoint if there are delays in
deeper and broader tax reforms, or if the economy weakens. At the same time, public wages are
projected to continue rising, while the government is facing mounting social spending pressures
(Cambodia’s development spending remains lower than that of peers). Reflecting these trends, the
fiscal deficit is projected to widen to around 3½-4 percent of GDP and government deposits are
projected to fall to 3.7 percent of GDP by 2021, below comfortable levels.19 In the absence of a
government debt market, maintaining adequate government deposits (the main source of financing
to conduct countercyclical fiscal policy) will be essential for maintaining macroeconomic stability as
they act as a buffer in the event of shocks. Staff analysis suggests that a government deposit level of
about 5.5 percent of GDP is adequate to withstand a major shock. This will necessitate consolidation
over the medium term, even though the Debt Sustainability Analysis (DSA) indicates a low risk of
debt distress (see DSA).20

Staff has estimated the revenue to GDP norm for Cambodia, and the results indicate that Cambodia has scope to
increase revenues by about 2-2.5 percent of GDP. However, between 2013-2015, the revenue-to-GDP ratio increased
by 2.8 pp of GDP. Given the higher base and the authorities’ plans to focus only on strengthening revenue
administration (in line with the RMS) without introducing any new taxes until 2018, the pace of revenue gains in the
near term is likely to moderate.
17

In particular, progress in other key areas of the RMS, such as return filing management, arrears collection,
transparent and simplified tax accounting and performance monitoring, is needed.
18

Relative to the last Article IV Consultation, medium-term projections assume higher concessional project loans
which finance increased development (education) and capital expenditures. Project loans are below the line, and the
commensurate increases in expenditures have widened the fiscal deficit modestly over the medium term.

19

Notwithstanding the low risk of debt distress, debt sustainability continues to be vulnerable to the materialization
of contingent liabilities related to financial sector risks and PPPs.

20

The average level of government deposits for 2000–15 was 4.6 percent of GDP. In the baseline (including gains
from RMS reforms), their level is projected to decline below 4 percent of GDP by 2021. Furthermore, if the revenueto-GDP ratio remains flat and concessional borrowing does not materialize, the fiscal deficit will widen while
government deposits will be depleted. Thus, continued revenue efforts are needed to maintain adequate
government deposits (estimated at about 5.5 percent of GDP).

incentives and excise taxes, and over the medium term aim at reforming VAT and personal
income taxes, and increasing property taxes.


Development spending should be prioritized as revenue gains are secured. Recent plans to
boost social protection spending are welcome. However, public expenditure on education and
health will still remain below low-income and emerging Asia country averages.



of public sector operations. In particular, balancing the goals of fiscal sustainability and
competitive civil service salaries will require careful targeting of incentives and higher pay
increases to priority functions and good performers.



Domestically-financed public investment should be increased, while raising its efficiency
and limiting contingent liabilities from Public Private Partnerships (PPPs). Specific
recommendations include: (i) increasing domestically-financed public investment to maintain
public investment at about 8.5 percent of GDP financed by boosting revenues (to prepare for an
eventual decline in external concessional financing as Cambodia’s per capita income rises
further); (ii) improving efficiency in all stages of the public investment process including
planning, allocation and implementation, and (iii) developing an appropriately structured
institutional framework for PPPs to reduce risks from contingent liabilities. In June 2016, the MEF
adopted a policy on PPPs outlining legal, regulatory and institutional frameworks. In addition, a
central PPP unit for risk management is being established in the MEF. Going forward, the
preparation and selection of PPPs should be integrated with the overall investment strategy and
the budget cycle, with clear procedures in place for budgeting, reporting, and accounting.



A Medium Term Fiscal Framework (MTFF) should be developed to systematically allocate
expenditure and improve efficiency. A MTFF will also integrate capital expenditure into the
budgetary process, and allow for a better assessment of the trade-offs between various types of
expenditures and their medium-term impact.

23.
Authorities’ views. The authorities broadly agreed with staff’s assessment and key policy
recommendations. On the revenue side, they agreed with the need to continue to boost revenues to
maintain fiscal sustainability, but noted the need to strike a balance and meet other objectives such
as promoting job creation and efficiency. They remained committed to continue implementing the
RMS, along with improving the institutional framework for revenue administration. They plan to
implement tax policy reforms over the medium term. On expenditures, they agreed on the
importance of developing a MTFF to improve expenditure allocation efficiency and are currently
reviewing the public expenditure framework. They are also planning to continue with civil service
reforms to improve public services, but noted constraints to speedy implementation. They
highlighted significant progress in increasing development spending, especially in health, primary
education, and social assistance. They plan to use PPPs to enhance infrastructure and social
spending, and acknowledged the need to develop a well-designed PPP framework.

C. Structural and Financial Sector Reforms to Enhance Sustainable and
Inclusive Growth
24.
Structural Constraints. Rapid growth over
the past two decades has significantly reduced the
poverty rate, which has fallen from 50 percent in
2005 to 18 percent in 2012, helping to reduce
income inequality.22 However, a large share of the
population remains vulnerable at just above the
poverty line. Also, despite rapid credit growth,
financial access remains limited, which indicates that
financial deepening has not been broad based.23
Cambodia also faces structural constraints and
vulnerabilities, including a narrow economic base,
weak business climate, and high dollarization coupled with underdeveloped financial markets. These
structural features constrain growth potential and render the economy and financial system
vulnerable to shocks, while limiting the scope for responding to such shocks.


Narrow Economic Base. Despite some early signs of diversification, Cambodia’s export base
remains narrow and reliant on low value-added garments. Garments production is highly
substitutable between countries, and can migrate quickly to those with better price
competitiveness. The government launched the Industrial Development Policy (IDP) in 2015
to attract FDI into non-garments labor-intensive manufacturing, and while recent FDI trends
point to early signs of diversification, progress has been slow.

Recent rapid growth has been associated with a reduction of inequality in Cambodia, with Gini coefficient falling
from 0.41 in 2007 to 0.31 in 2012 (World Bank’s World Development Indicators).

22

23 According to the World Bank’s Global Findex, the percentage of population having accounts increased (from
3.7 percent in 2011 to 22.2 percent in 2014), but remains low.

16

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

CAMBODIA



Weak Business Climate and Eroding Competitiveness. Rising minimum wages and stalled
productivity improvements, along with heightened uncertainty from labor disputes, have
been eroding competitiveness. The cost of doing business remains high due to inadequate
transportation links, elevated energy costs, nontransparent and onerous government
procedures.



Dollarization. High dollarization increases banks’ vulnerability to solvency and liquidity risks,
and limits the scope for exchange rate and monetary policies.



Underdeveloped Financial Markets. There is no government bond market despite the
need to channel domestic savings to finance growth-enhancing expenditure. The foreign
exchange market remains thin and transactions center on small retail money changers.
Limited financial markets impede the efficient allocation of resources and risk sharing, and
constrain monetary policy implementation and the efficacy of fiscal policy, given the
absence of financing instruments.

25.
Business Climate Reforms. Efforts should focus on lowering the costs of doing business to
boost competitiveness and create more employment opportunities in higher value-added industries.
Priorities would include reducing energy costs, improving its reliability, enhancing transportation
links, and addressing skills gaps via improving the quality of education and promoting technical and
vocational training. Efforts should be made to accelerate the implementation of the IDP, which was
formulated to improve the business climate. Additionally, strengthening the rule of law, and
increasing the transparency of business regulation and tax compliance requirements will help create
a more conducive business environment and encourage long-term investment.
26.
Financial Market Development. Reforms should be geared towards increasing usage of the
local currency and accelerating financial market development. While success in de-dollarization will
be gradual, the development of interbank, government bond, and foreign exchange markets is
needed to promote de-dollarization and allow for the eventual implementation of an effective
monetary policy framework. Specifically, (i) expedite issuing shorter-term Negotiable Certificates of
Deposits (NCD) to make the interbank market more liquid and move towards auction pricing,
(ii) restructure the FX market and encourage banks (instead of money changers) to play a greater
role, (iii) develop government bond markets in line with the authorities’ Financial Sector
Development Strategy (2011–2020), (iv) ensure proper supervision and regulation, (vi) adopt
measures to encourage de-dollarization, potentially based on the draft national strategy to promote
increased usage of local currency (see below).24

Authorities’ views. The authorities remain committed to implementing the IDP and agreed
with staff on the need to accelerate implementation. Both the Law on Investment and the Law on
Special Economic Zones are under revision and aim to improve the business environment and
support diversification, in line with IDP. The government has implemented various measures to

promote securities market development, and has also prepared rules and regulations for a
government bond market (to be finalized by 2018). The NBC highlighted their efforts to develop the
interbank market by supporting greater usage of NCDs. In line with government policy, the NBC
remains committed to promoting the usage of local currency and has recently launched a new
electronic payments and FAST system (Fast and Secure Transfer) system to better facilitate riel
transactions. The national strategy to increase local currency usage, drafted by the NBC, is currently
at the Economic and Financial Policy Committee for consideration.

STAFF APPRAISAL
28.
Economic setting. Growth is projected to remain strong, driven by strong garments exports,
real estate and construction activity as well as the reduction in oil prices, and notwithstanding
weaker contributions from agriculture and tourism sectors. Inflation has increased slightly but is
expected to remain well contained. Private sector credit growth has been and is projected to remain
high, and is increasingly concentrated in the real estate and construction sectors. Medium-term
growth is projected to moderate somewhat due to a gradual reduction in FDI, challenges in
diversification, and a moderation in the credit cycle. The external position is assessed to be
moderately weaker than suggested by fundamentals and desirable policies.
29.
Risks. The outlook is subject to downside risks. On the external side, a significant slowdown
in China would spill over through the FDI, banking and tourism channels. A surge in the US dollar
and/or weaker growth in Europe could weigh on garments exports. Also, a sharper-than-anticipated
tightening in global financial conditions could raise funding costs and heighten liquidity risks in the
financial system. On the domestic side, the ongoing credit boom poses significant risks to macrofinancial stability and growth. Other domestic risks include fiscal pressures and erosion of
competitiveness from wage hikes potentially outstripping productivity gains.
30.
Financial sector policies. Securing a soft landing of the credit cycle and continuing to build
capital and liquidity buffers through well-coordinated and sequenced prudential policy tools will be
key to containing rising macro-financial risks. On the micro-prudential side, regulations on asset
classification, provisioning, and sectoral loan classification need to be strengthened. Well-designed
macro-prudential tools should be gradually introduced, including implementing countercyclical
capital buffers and provisions, imposing concentration limits and higher risk weights for real-estate
loans, and instituting limits on LTD ratios. The prompt corrective action framework should be
strengthened and a crisis management framework should be put in place with more explicit interagency coordination mechanisms.
31.
Monetary policy and other prudential tools need to be used to further contain rapid
credit growth. Reserve requirements should be raised, particularly on short-term foreign currency
deposits and foreign borrowing. Well-designed and targeted fiscal measures, such as stamp duties,
a capital gains tax, and tightening the issuance of new construction permits should be used to
manage the real estate cycle.

18

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

CAMBODIA

32.
Supervision and financial market development. Strong supervision is essential to ensure
proper risk identification and enforce micro and macro prudential policies. In this respect, the
implementation of FSAP recommendations should be expedited including continued supervisory
capacity building. With the growing systemic relevance of large MFIs, strengthening regulation to
prevent regulatory arbitrage is warranted. Reforms to reduce dollarization and to develop the
interbank, government bond, and foreign exchange markets are needed to build an effective
monetary policy framework.
33.
Fiscal Policy. To ensure that the recent revenue gains are sustained over the medium-term,
reforms should focus on modernizing tax policy and further improving revenue administration. Tax
policy reforms should center on improving the productivity, efficiency and transparency of most
taxes, and rationalize tax incentives, improve business taxation, and reform excise and property
taxes. Tax administration reforms should focus on building a strong institutional framework to
entrench recent administrative improvements and implement future reforms. On the expenditure
side, developing a medium-term budget framework to systematically allocate expenditures and
improve spending efficiency would be key going forward. An appropriately structured institutional
framework for PPPs is also needed to limit contingent liabilities. Wage increases should be fiscally
sustainable and be accompanied by continued efforts to enhance civil service reforms.
34.
Structural reforms are needed to secure inclusive and sustained growth. These should
include promoting diversification, enhancing competitiveness, and improving the business climate
and inclusiveness. A focus should be on accelerating the implementation of the Industrial
Development Policy to boost investor confidence, implementing key infrastructure projects (in
energy and transportation), strengthening the rule of law and transparency/predictability of business
regulation, and further investing in education and skills building.
35.
It is recommended that the next Article IV consultation takes place on the standard 12month cycle.

Box 1. Cambodia: Proactive Policy Reform and Weak Reform Scenarios1
This box illustrates projections of medium-term GDP growth in a proactive policy reform scenario,
compared with a weak-reform scenario. The scenarios suggest that (1) decisively moderating the pace of
credit growth and boosting potential growth through supply-side reforms will yield substantial benefits,
after an initial adjustment period, in terms of higher and safer growth. Conversely (2) in the weak-reform
scenario, growth may initially be somewhat higher but at the cost of significantly weaker growth down the
road and, most importantly, and increasing risk of a ‘hard landing” (sharply reduced growth and/or
financial crisis).

Proactive policy reform scenario. This assumes implementation of key structural reforms,
including the investment law, which would boost investor confidence, timely management of
planned infrastructure projects, and investments in education and skills building. These policies
are projected to boost the country’s growth potential. At the same time, policies that mitigate
rising financial sector vulnerabilities and engineer a soft landing of the real estate and credit
cycle will reduce risk of a ‘hard landing’ and boost confidence in the government’s policy
framework. These measures together are predicted to generate economic growth that averages
7 percent or above. Thus, by 2021, GDP would be about 8 percent higher than in the weak
reform scenario, and—most importantly—the risk of a hard landing/financial crisis would be
much reduced.

Weak reform scenario.2 This scenario assumes no significant supply-side reforms and
continuing rapid credit growth. In particular, the ‘credit-to-GDP ratio’ would continue to grow

Box 2. Cambodia: External Sector Assessment1
The external position is assessed to be moderately weaker than implied by fundamentals and desirable policy
settings. The real effective exchange rate is assessed to be moderately overvalued by around 5–10 percent.
There is room to build reserves given high dollarization and elevated financial vulnerabilities.

balance approach of the Fund’s EBA-lite exercise,
which translates into a REER overvaluation of around 5.7 percent). Much of the misalignment in the external
sector can be explained by the current calibration of credit and monetary (and to a lesser extent fiscal)
policies away from the most desirable policy settings, which are looser than would be optimal given the
economic cycle.
Exchange Rate Assessment. Since end-2015, the REER has appreciated by around 8 percent (year-on-year).
The appreciation reflects the nominal rise in the US dollar against major trading partner countries (EU and
China), buoyant economic growth, and inflows of foreign banking flows. The REER is assessed to be
overvalued by around 5–10 percent, which implies that a 5–10 percent real effective depreciation would be
necessary to close the gap between the underlying current account and the level that can be explained by
fundamentals and desirable policies. The overvaluation, in the absence of an independent exchange rate
regime, calls for policies to slow credit growth in

like Cambodia to be around 4 months of

imports. However, foreign currency deposits are still more than two times gross official reserves, which
severely limits the central bank’s lender of last resort capacity, and is lower than regional comparators.
Customizing the Jeanne and Ranciere (2006) model, which incorporates high dollarization and financial
fragilities when assessing reserve adequacy, suggests that the optimal level of reserves ranges from 28 to
30 percent of GDP, which is equivalent to additional reserves of US$250 to US$480 million. The authorities
should continue to accumulate reserves beyond the level suggested by traditional reserve adequacy metrics
to enhance resilience against financial sector vulnerabilities and rapid capital flow reversals.

Box 3. Cambodia: Real and Financial Spillovers from China to Cambodia1
Increased economic integration over the last 15 years has resulted in larger real and financial spillovers from
China to Cambodia. To preserve macro stability in the face of rising vulnerability to regional shocks, policy
frameworks, including moving towards greater monetary flexibility, need to be strengthened.
A high degree of openness suggests that Cambodia
is vulnerable to spillover effects from China via a
number of potential transmission channels:
-

-

FDI and official flows: Chinese companies invest
in the garment sector to take advantage of
Cambodia’s preferential tariffs with the EU.
China is the largest provider of official flows to
Cambodia.
Banking sector flows: Chinese banks, reliant on
wholesale funding, have sizeable market share
in Cambodia.
Tourism: Chinese citizens have contributed
most to Cambodia tourism growth in recent
years.

Trade and financial linkages between Cambodia and China have grown. To assess the spillovers from
Chinese economic shocks to Cambodia (real and financial effects), a time-varying structural dynamic factor
model is estimated.2 The main results are:
-

Cambodia’s growth elasticity to China’s growth
is around 0.2 percent. This is double the
magnitude compared to 10 years ago, which is
consistent with Cambodia’s strengthening regional
trade and financial integration.

-

A slowdown in Chinese growth tightens credit
conditions in Cambodia and leads to declining
credit growth. This effect has strengthened since
the global financial crisis. The findings imply that
stronger growth in China, through a compression
in risk premia, could contribute to the procyclicality of credit flows into Cambodia.

As trade and financial linkages grow, Cambodia is
increasingly likely to be buffeted by external shocks, including from China. To preserve financial
stability, policy frameworks need to be strengthened, including reforms to allow for greater monetary
flexibility to cope with regional shocks, and financial safety nets need to be widened and deepened to build
resilience. The findings also call for enhancing surveillance of cross-border financial flows to derive a more
comprehensive picture of the deeper network of interconnections and spillovers to Cambodia, as well as
identification of associated data gaps and working toward their closure.

Box 4. Cambodia: Upgrading Nonbank Regulations1
Rapid growth of deposit-taking micro-finance institutions (MFIs) have rendered them systemically important.
Regulations need to be tightened and be brought in line with banks to adequately contain potential risks and
prevent regulatory arbitrage.
Regulators face the twin challenges of closing regulation gaps between banks and MFIs and
mitigating stability risks from rapidly growing MFI lending.
The bank assets-to-GDP ratio has grown from 55 percent in 2010
to 110 percent as of 2015, while MFI assets-to-GDP ratio has
grown rapidly from 4 percent to 20 percent. The largest deposittaking MFI (MDI) is equivalent in terms of total assets to the 7th
largest bank. MDIs are competing with banks for the same funding
base while being subject to different regulations, creating room
for regulatory arbitrage. There are four possible financial stability
risks that could result: (1) credit risk (risk of highly-indebted
households rolling over debt), (2) liquidity risk (sudden withdrawals of deposits and/or squeeze in foreign
borrowing), (3) FX risk (currency mismatch between deposits in U.S. dollars and lending in local currency),
and (4) systemic risks due to increased interconnectedness between MFIs and banks.
In general, regulations on deposit-taking MFIs should be broadly in line with those of commercial
banks though some principles require tailoring. As with other forms of financial regulation, the primary
aim is to ensure the stability of the financial system and to protect depositors without imposing undue
compliance burdens or stifling lending. MFIs pose an additional layer of complexity in that the industry’s
need for flexibility to innovate and grow must be balanced with rules and restrictions to protect low-income
and vulnerable clients (CGAP, 2012). Thus, regulations should aim to (i) reduce risk of regulatory arbitrage
and (ii) minimize costs created by additional regulation for MFIs. Supervision should be proportionate to the
risks involved, while keeping in mind stretched supervisory capacity.
Recommendations.
(1) The CAR should be aligned with Basel II and III principles. While current regulations apply equally to MDIs
and banks, actual CARs are, on average, lower than that of banks. If MDIs’ ability to raise additional capital is
limited compared to banks, or they exhibit a more pronounced risk profile, the minimum CAR should be set
higher than that for banks.
(2) Asset classification should be standardized for all banks and MFIs.
(3) Reserve requirements (RR), including on foreign currency deposits, for MDIs should be adjusted to be in
line with banks. Since MFIs are more reliant on foreign financing, RR on foreign borrowings should be
instituted to all MFIs and applied based on the maturity profile of borrowings (short term borrowings). To
limit the impact on the financial system and financial inclusion, implementation should be gradual.
(4) The NBC must constantly evaluate how effectively MFIs are managing potential currency mismatches,
including cross-border financing arrangements with international lenders, and consider further restricting
MDI’s net open position should risks abruptly rise.
(5) Clear identification of systemically important MDIs is needed and routine monitoring of interbank, interMFIs, inter-financial institutions linkages should be strengthened.

Box 5. Cambodia: Domestic Resource Mobilization1
An ambitious set of tax reforms are needed to provide adequate resources to meet Cambodia’s development and
infrastructure needs. The strategy should be two-pronged via strengthening tax policy and continuing
improvements in revenue administration.
Tax Policy. There is room for improvement in productivity, efficiency and transparency. Significant reforms are
needed across all tax categories with immediate emphasis on improving the productivity of business profits
taxes. A priority is to eliminate the “tax notches” between small and medium enterprises by applying a flat tax
rate structure to profits.


Tax incentives. The framework needs to be rationalized and streamlined, including for withholding
taxes on interest, dividends and other payments to foreign investors.



Property taxes should be raised gradually.



Patent and business tax The patent tax should be eliminated, and the current system of minimum
turnover tax should be replaced with a modern advanced payment system.



Excise taxes should be rationalized and all ad valorem rates should be replaced with specific rates.



VAT exemptions on utility sales (electricity and water) should eliminated.



Personal income tax. A comprehensive PIT scheme including on pensions and capital income should
be developed, once a well-designed administrative framework is in place.

Tax Administration. Reforms on tax policy should move alongside the development of a strong institutional
framework for revenue administration. The General Department of Taxation (GDT) needs to be strengthened to
be able to implement the major tax policy reforms while increasing taxpayer compliance levels in an ever-more
sophisticated economic environment. Thus, the GDT needs to establish an effective tax headquarters with the
capacity to drive the ongoing reforms under the RMS and implement any proposed policy changes. This will
involve:


Improving core functional areas such as taxpayer education to increase awareness of tax compliance
laws, and return filing management and tax arrears collection that ensure equitable tax enforcement
across businesses and sectors;



Implementing the simplified accounting format to replace the estimated regime and enhancing large
and medium taxpayer compliance.



Strengthening performance monitoring including on RMS progress would require developing a set of
broader performance indicators for the GDT that would also enhance transparency.

On the customs, the emphasis should be on effective implementation of the strategic plan adopted by General
Department of Customs and Excise (GDCE) and program development capacities in customs valuation and
post-clearance audit. GDCE’s customs enforcement and compliance strategy should also include an antismuggling policy and action plan. Opportunities also exist for increased cooperation and sharing of
information between GDCE and GDT.

Box 6. Cambodia: Public Investment, Efficiency, and Growth1, 2
Infrastructure gaps are large and the public investment management process is inefficient. Continuing to
mobilize revenues and channeling them to public investment, while improving its efficiency, will boost growth.
Large infrastructure gaps exist in Cambodia,
despite increasing public investment.
Cambodia compares unfavorably on
infrastructure outcomes relative to Emerging
and Developing Asia (EDA). Lagging areas
include electricity, public education, and public
health outcomes. The last two decades have
seen public investment (as percent of GDP)
increase and converge to the EDA average.
However, Cambodia’s public capital stock and
private investment still lag the EDA average.
Low public investment efficiency has
hampered public capital accumulation.
Improvement is needed across all areas of the
Public Investment Management Assessment
(PIMA) framework including: (i) moving to multiyear budgeting, (ii) protection of investment and monitoring of assets, (iii) budget comprehensiveness and
fiscal rules and (vi) the management of PPPs. Strengthening the PPP framework requires better managing
and monitoring fiscal risks related to PPPs, while fully integrating PPPs into the government’s overall
investment strategy, medium-term fiscal framework, and budget cycle.
Limited domestic financing sources constrains any attempt to boost public capital spending. A
projected decline in donor support with the attainment of LMIC status and limited progress in developing
local debt markets, means options for increasing public investment going forward is tied to success in
boosting revenues, and implementing well-structured PPPs.
Public investment is estimated to have a strong positive effect on growth in Cambodia. A gradual
scaling up of public investment by around 2 p.p. of GDP over 8 years, in which investment is financed by
improved revenue collection and learning-by-doing productivity improvements, would increase Cambodia’s
real GDP growth by around 2 percentage points with little risk to long-term public debt sustainability.3

Recommendation
General Stability
I. Improve the quality of data to enable an appropriate assessment of risks, and to enhance the reliability of
stress tests, including through strengthening supervision; and collecting additional credit-related
information.
II. Ensure that banks retain an appropriate level of liquid assets to be able to meet short-term obligations by
enforcing existing regulations.
III. Upgrade law to formalize delineation of responsibilities among supervisors, and establish procedures,
through MOUs, for practical information exchange, coordination and accountability among domestic
supervisors (NBC, MEF, SECC), and with foreign supervisors.
IV. Upgrade both the number and capacity of staff in the areas of banking, insurance, securities and payment
system supervision; develop training programs for financial institutions on accounting, corporate
governance, risk management, and for the external audit profession.
V. Develop and implement a strategic plan to address the conflicts and overlaps in the financial sector legal
and regulatory framework.

STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2016 ARTICLE IV
CONSULTATION—DEBT SUSTAINABILITY ANALYSIS
Approved By
Markus Rodlauer and
Steve Barnett (IMF), and
Paloma Anós Casero (WB)

Prepared by Staff of the International Monetary Fund and
the World Bank

This Debt Sustainability Analysis (DSA) shows that Cambodia is at low risk of debt distress
with all debt burden indicators projected to remain below the respective indicative
thresholds. The results also indicate that debt sustainability continues to be vulnerable to
growth, exports, and adverse revenue shocks, and the materialization of contingent
liabilities. The findings reinforce the need for continued structural reforms to increase the
economy’s resilience to external shocks, and to mobilize fiscal revenues.

CAMBODIA

1.
This DSA continues to assess Cambodia at a low risk of debt distress. The indicative debt
distress thresholds remain unchanged from the 2015 Article IV DSA. Under the baseline scenario, the
external and the public debt burden indicators never breach the policy-dependent indicative
thresholds, and the PV of external debt follows a downward trend in the medium term. Downside
risks to the baseline scenario include external arrears, and the materialization of contingent liabilities.
The macroeconomic assumptions underlying the baseline scenario remain similar to the 2015 DSA.
Cambodia’s Country Policy and Institutional Assessment (CPIA) rating remained unchanged at
“medium performer.”

CAMBODIA’S PUBLIC DEBT
2.
Cambodia’s stock of external public debt, including arrears, stood at around
US$5.6 billion or 32 percent of GDP (22 percent of GDP in present value terms) as of end2015. The debt-to-GDP ratio has been steadily increasing since 2008, when it was 27 percent of GDP.
The increase in external debt since then has been driven largely by disbursement of bilateral loans.
The corresponding present value (PV) of the external debt was 22.1 percent of GDP at end 2015.

3.
Bilateral debt has been increasing over time, and the share of multilateral debt has
continued to decline. China remains the largest bilateral creditor, contributing to around 80 percent
of the total bilateral debt stock, including arrears. Cambodia remains in arrears to the Russian
Federation and the United States (nearly 16 percent of total debt or 4 percent of GDP), and the status
of negotiations of these arrears has remained unchanged since the last DSA. Cambodia is not
servicing its debt with these two creditors. The Cambodian authorities have been in contact with the
Russian and the U.S. authorities at least on an annual basis, but further efforts are needed to
conclude agreements under the Paris Club framework. Since prospects for resolution remain unclear,
this DSA continues to assume no debt restructuring, with arrears continuing to build up over the
projection period.
4.
Public domestic debt remains negligible. There is a small amount of bonds
(US$3.2 million) issued in the early 2000s and some old claims on the government (the total equal to
half percent of GDP, with no interest) that were carried over from the 1990s and remain to be
recorded in the monetary survey.
2

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

CAMBODIA

5.
The authorities have made considerable progress in monitoring contingent liabilities
from PPPs through strengthening the institutional framework, but further efforts are needed
to enhance fiscal transparency and capacity. In line with past Fund recommendations, reinforced
by contingent liability management technical assistance provided by the Bank, the authorities
adopted an annual ceiling on PPP guarantees at 4 percent of GDP. On the institutional side, in June
2016, the Ministry of Economy and Finance (MEF) has adopted a policy on PPPs outlining legal,
regulatory and institutional frameworks. In addition, a central PPP unit for risk management is being
established in the MEF. To enhance fiscal transparency, the authorities should also list all contingent
liabilities in the annual budget law. Even with debt remaining sustainable with a low risk of distress,
continued close monitoring and analysis of fiscal risks through further strengthening of capacity is
needed to safeguard fiscal space.

MACROECONOMIC FRAMEWORK
6.
The macroeconomic framework underlying the baseline scenario remains broadly in
line with the previous DSA.


Growth and inflation: Economic activity remains strong driven by robust exports, real
estate, and construction. GDP growth is expected at 7.0 percent in 2016 and is projected to
slow to around 6.3–7.0 percent until 2021, assuming some product diversification and
supportive policies. Inflation (CPI average) remained low in 2015 at 1.2 percent due to low
energy and commodity prices, and is expected to rise slightly to 3.2 percent at end-2016.
In the medium-term, inflation is expected to average 3 percent.



External sector stability: Higher-than-expected garment exports and tourism arrivals
helped narrow the current account deficit, including official transfers, in 2015 to
10.6 percent of GDP. Continued strong export growth and low commodity prices are
expected to narrow the non-interest current account deficit to around 10.2 percent of GDP
in 2016. The completion of large power projects should help lower import growth, while
improved competitiveness and diversification spurred by the participation in the ASEAN
Economic Community (AEC) should help lower the current account deficit over the
medium-term to around 8½ percent of GDP, which is expected to remain fully financed by
FDI and official loans. Gross official reserves are projected to rise to around 5.7 months of
prospective imports through to 2021. External bilateral debt disbursement is projected to
average about US$700 million annually during 2015‒21 (about 4 percent of GDP on
average), resulting in a debt to GDP ratio of just over 35 percent by 2021, after which the
debt ratio is projected to decline.



Fiscal sustainability: Revenue performance, supported by the implementation of the
Revenue Mobilization Strategy (RMS), saw tax revenues rise by 0.5 percent of GDP to
14.6 percent of GDP in 2015 from 13.7 in 2014. However, the expenditure mix worsened in
2015 as pressure to raise public wages led to a 0.9 percent of GDP increase in the wage
bill, while capital spending was compressed by 0.7 percent of GDP. As a result, the 2015
INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

3

CAMBODIA

fiscal deficit widened slightly from 1.3 percent of GDP in 2014 to 1.6 percent of GDP in
2015 (but remained well below the budget target). The level of government deposits (as a
share of GDP) rose to 9.1 percent of GDP by end-2015. The fiscal deficit is projected to
widen to 2.6 percent of GDP (but remain below the budget target) in 2016 as rising current
expenditure (the wage bill by 0.2 percent of GDP and non-wage current expenditures by
1 percent of GDP) more than offsets gains from revenue mobilization. Government
deposits are projected to stay at around 9.3 percent of GDP in 2016, which are assessed to
be adequate. Over the medium-term, fiscal pressures are expected to emerge due to wage
pressures even though strong revenue performance is projected to continue as the tax
administration measures contained in the RMS generate revenue gains. Medium-term
fiscal policy should be anchored to safeguarding government deposits and long-term
fiscal debt sustainability, while striking a balance between providing resources for
Cambodia’s vast development needs and rising wage and social spending pressures.


Domestic debt: As Cambodia’s financial sector continues to develop, it is expected that
the government will start issuing domestic government bonds to provide additional fiscal
financing. By issuing debt starting from ¼ ppt of GDP annually in 2021 and gradually
increasing to about ½ ppt of GDP in 2035, the total stock of domestic debt would reach
about 3.7 percent of GDP by 2035. This remains low compared to the average domestic
debt in low-income countries (LICs) of about 15 percent of GDP. However, this
conservative estimate is in line with the authorities’ intention of not issuing domestic debt
over the medium term and to focus more on mobilizing domestic revenue and raising
government deposits (i.e., saving, not borrowing).

EXTERNAL AND PUBLIC DEBT SUSTAINABILITY
7.
Under the baseline scenario, the external DSA shows that Cambodia’s risk of debt
distress is low (Figure 1, Tables 1a and 1b). The PV of debt-to-GDP, debt-to-exports, and debt-torevenue ratios never breach their respective policy-dependent indicative thresholds and are
projected to decline over the projection period. Moreover, the debt service-to-exports and debt
service-to-revenue ratios remain well below the thresholds throughout the projection period, partly
due to the concessional nature of the debt.
8.
Standard stress tests do not indicate any major vulnerability, but highlight that large
exchange rate or export shocks could potentially have a major impact on external debt
dynamics. A decline in export growth remains an important risk to debt sustainability. As shown in
Figure 1, this shock would bring the PV of debt-to-GDP to 39 percent in 2018 (just below the
indicative threshold of 40 percent), declining to 18 percent in the long-term. Similarly, a large one-off
depreciation would bring the PV of debt-to-GDP to about 35 percent in 2018, and subsequently
declining to 21 percent in the long-term. While this highlights the importance of continuous
monitoring of debt dynamics, the PV of external debt declines over the projection period and does
not currently indicate any major vulnerability.

4

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

CAMBODIA

9.
Public debt is vulnerable to a large exchange rate depreciation shock and to weak
revenue growth. Under a one-off real depreciation shock, the PV of public debt-to-GDP would
reach 33 percent in 2018, and then decline over time. If the primary balance remains unchanged at
the 2015 level, the PV of public debt-to-GDP would increase to about 27 percent by 2020, with debt
projected to continue modestly rising over the long-term. This implies that efforts to mobilize
revenues to guarantee long-term debt sustainability should continue. Public debt is projected to
decline over the medium-term in the baseline and extreme shock scenario, and do not present any
major vulnerability at present.
10.
Public debt sustainability is at risk from a rise in contingent liabilities related to PPPs
and potential financial stress.1 PPP investments in power generation and distribution projects are
large, and in case of adverse scenarios, associated fiscal risks could arise and potentially add
substantial liabilities to the debt stock. Other potential contingent liabilities include the fiscal costs to
support the financial sector during a banking crisis.
11.
The authorities broadly agree with the findings from the DSA exercise. The debt
management unit at the Ministry of Economy and Finance (MEF) conducts its own internal DSA
analysis, and has reached the same conclusion of low risk of debt distress. They use the results of
these analyses to propose annual ceilings of new net debt disbursements. The authorities assume a
similar loan disbursement profile and current account deficits, but are slightly more optimistic than
staff on the medium-term real GDP growth assumption. The MEF expressed concern about the
accumulation of contingent liabilities from PPPs and have imposed annual ceilings on PPP
guarantees.

CONCLUSION
12.
Cambodia remains at low risk of debt distress. The baseline projections and the standard
stress tests show limited risk to external debt given that none of the indicators breach their
thresholds. Downside risks to the baseline scenario include the materialization of contingent liabilities
and issues arising from external arrears. The most extreme stress tests indicate that Cambodia’s debt
sustainability remains vulnerable to shocks in the exchange rate, economic growth, exports, and the
fiscal position. This reinforces the importance of preserving macroeconomic stability and diversifying
the economy and exports to increase resilience to external shocks, and the successful
implementation of the revenue mobilization strategy.

1

The authorities have requested IMF technical assistance on PPPs using the Fiscal Risk Assessment Model (PFRAM), which will (i) evaluate the PPP management framework; (ii) provide capacity building in assessing fiscal
risks and contingent liabilities arising from PPPs; and (iii) identify mitigating measures among other priorities
currently under discussion. There is also an on-going technical assistance by development partners, with the
ADB supporting Cambodia in establishing a legal and institutional framework for development of PPPs and the
World Bank providing technical assistance to determine the size of contingent liabilities related to PPPs.

Includes both public and private sector external debt.
Derived as [r - g - ρ(1+g)]/(1+g+ρ+gρ) times previous period debt ratio, with r = nominal interest rate; g = real GDP growth rate, and ρ = growth rate of GDP deflator in U.S. dollar terms.
Includes exceptional financing (i.e., changes in arrears and debt relief); changes in gross foreign assets; and valuation adjustments. For projections also includes contribution from price and exchange rate changes.
Assumes that PV of private sector debt is equivalent to its face value.
Current-year interest payments divided by previous period debt stock.
Historical averages and standard deviations are generally derived over the past 10 years, subject to data availability.
Defined as grants, concessional loans, and debt relief.
Grant-equivalent financing includes grants provided directly to the government and through new borrowing (difference between the face value and the PV of new debt).

2/ Assumes that the interest rate on new borrowing is by 2 percentage points higher than in the baseline., while grace and maturity periods are the same as in the baseline.
3/ Exports values are assumed to remain permanently at the lower level, but the current account as a share of GDP is assumed to return to its baseline level after the shock (implicitly
assuming an offsetting adjustment in import levels).
4/ Includes official and private transfers and FDI.
5/ Depreciation is defined as percentage decline in dollar/local currency rate, such that it never exceeds 100 percent.
6/ Applies to all stress scenarios except for A2 (less favorable financing) in which the terms on all new financing are as specified in footnote 2.

Multilateral Debt Relief Initiative
As part of the Multilateral Debt Relief Initiative (MDRI), the IMF Executive Board on January 5, 2006,
approved relief on 100 percent of debt incurred by Cambodia to the IMF before January 1, 2005. This
resulted in the forgiving of all of Cambodia’s outstanding debt to the IMF, a total of SDR 56.8 million
(about US$82 million). The authorities intend to spend the resources over a number of years, initially on

rural irrigation projects. The National Bank of Cambodia (NBC) transferred the full MDRI proceeds to the
Ministry of Economy and Finance effective March 2006.
Safeguards Assessment
A voluntary safeguards assessment of the NBC was completed in January 2010 at the request of the
authorities, which updated the previous March 2004 voluntary assessment. The update assessment
found that the NBC had taken steps to strengthen aspects of its safeguards framework; however,
important recommendations proposed in 2004 were still outstanding, and some new risks had emerged
in the area of external audit.
Exchange Rate Arrangement and Payments System
Cambodia’s exchange regime is classified as other-managed arrangement. The de jure regime is a
managed float. The official exchange rate, which is expressed in riels per U.S. dollar, applies to all official
external transactions conducted by the central government and state enterprises, and is used for
accounting purposes by the NBC. It is determined by the foreign exchange market, with the official rate
adjusted to be within 1 percent of the market rate on a daily basis.
Cambodia accepted the obligations of Article VIII, Sections 2, 3, and 4 on January 1, 2002. Cambodia
maintains an exchange system that is free of restrictions on the making of payments and transfers
for current international transactions.
Article IV Consultation
Cambodia is on the standard 12-month Article IV consultation cycle. The last Article IV consultation
discussions were held in Phnom Penh during June 22–July 3, 2015. The Executive Board considered
the staff report (IMF Country Report 15/307) on October 26, 2015.
Financial Sector Assessment Program (FSAP)
The joint IMF-World Bank FSAP mission took place in March 2010 and the assessment was
completed in October 2010.
Technical Assistance
Technical assistance is currently focused on bank supervision, monetary operations, tax policy, and
administration including customs administration, macro-fiscal and revenue forecasting, financial
sector supervision, and macro-financial statistics. Delivery is through a resident advisor at the NBC,
peripatetic experts, and short-term visits from headquarters.
Resident Representative
The IMF Resident Representative in Phnom Penh (Ms. Yong Sarah Zhou) was appointed in July 2015.
Mr. Faisal Ahmed, former Resident Representative, assumed the post for the Cambodian IMF office
from July 2011 to July 2015.

IMF-WORLD BANK COLLABORATION
(July 2016)
The Bank and the IMF teams for Cambodia, led by Mr. Mathew Verghis (Practice Manager
GMFDR) and Ms. Jain-Chandra (IMF Mission Chief for Cambodia), maintain a close working
relationship and have an active dialogue on a range of macroeconomic and structural issues.
Recent key areas of cooperation and coordination include:
 Macroeconomic policy advice to the authorities. The IMF and the World Bank staffs have
consulted each other on key macroeconomic policy messages to the authorities to avoid sending
conflicting messages. Bank staff share and discuss the bi-annual Country and East-Asia and Pacific
Economic Updates. IMF staff share policy notes and analytical background notes related to
Article IV consultation missions. The World Bank and IMF staff regularly meet with policymakers
from the Ministry of Economy and Finance and the National Bank of Cambodia to timely address
emerging issues related to macroeconomic performance and management.
 Financial sector reform and FSAP. The World Bank and the IMF teams have worked closely
together while undertaking the 2010 FSAP. In line with the FSAP recommendations, technical
assistance missions supporting financial sector resilience are now ongoing and close coordination
between the IMF and the World Bank continues. The IMF and the World Bank Group (WBG) jointly
co-organized the Macro-Prudential and Financial Stability Workshop for all Cambodian financial
regulators. The World Bank and the IMF teams currently are working together to support capacity
building through knowledge sharing and south-south exchanges on monetary statistics, monetary
policy, and financial stability for the Ministry of Economy and Finance and the National Bank of
Cambodia.
 Public financial management and tax and customs administration reform. Both institutions
are working closely together under the Public Financial Management Reform Program (PFMRP)
including 2014–18 revenue mobilization strategy as well as tax and customs administration
reform. Both teams are members of the Development Partner Committee (DPC) of the PFMRP, a
coordination mechanism for all Development Partners’ support for the PFMRP under a Sector
Wide Approach, and share information on the work done in this area. The Phase 1 launch of the
FMIS on July 20, 2015 marks a major milestone toward the full implementation of a
comprehensive transaction processing, improved financial control, and an improved and more
transparent financial report generation facility. In addition, the IMF and the World Bank are closely
communicating in the context of the preparation of a tax policy review (IMF) and an assessment of
tax incentives (World Bank, under an ongoing Public Expenditure Review).
 Trade facilitation and private sector development. Both institutions are providing technical
support to GDCE/MEF on customs and border reform, regulatory reform, and streamlined import
and export procedures. The WBG Trade Related-Assistance in Cambodia program (TRAC) has
contributed to enhanced information/improvements in the areas of nontariff measures (NTM),

phytosanitary standards, improved trade logistics, trade repository, investment incentive policy,
and integration into regional production networks. The WBG Trade Facilitation Facility (TFF)
supported the GDCE/MEF to develop Cambodia National Single Window (CNSW) blueprint.
 The Trade Development Support Program (TDSP) continues to support the implementation of a
trade sector wide approach (Trade SWAp) expansion of ASYCUDA to 58 customs checkpoints
across the geography, covering 95 percent of imports and exports transactions; support to MAFF
on SPS automation system; and technical assistance to MOC on certification of country origin
automation, trade-marks registration system, business registration automation system, and trade
training research institution (TTRI). TSDP also supports the private sector development on export
training, value chain study, labor and commercial dispute resolution through the arbitration
council foundation (ACF) and the national council arbitration of Cambodia (NCAC). Cambodia
gained ranking 56 places in the Logistics Performance Indicators (LPI) in 2010–16, and abolished
unnecessary certificates of origin (CO) required by the importing countries.
 Article IV consultations. IMF Article IV consultations regularly share their macroeconomic data
with the World Bank and hold working sessions to try and reconcile macroeconomic data sets. The
collaboration is closest on the debt sustainability analysis, a joint product, but extends more
broadly into other areas of the consultation as well. World Bank staff are also invited to attend key
meetings. The IMF also joined in some of the WB capacity building TA missions on contingent
liabilities. Both institutions are considering using the TA mission findings to further strengthen the
DSA analysis.
 Structural reforms. The IMF staff and the World Bank teams have worked together to share views
on a range of other issues, including structural reforms for improving investment climate,
economic diversification, customs modernization, and rural development. The World Bank and IMF
staff have worked together to encourage the authorities to speed up civil service reforms to
improve public sector performance on public service delivery as well as to boost competiveness.
Based on the above partnership, the World Bank and the IMF share a common view about
Cambodia’s macroeconomic and structural reform priorities. These include:
 Sustaining growth. Growth remains robust although there are signs of deceleration. While
decelerating, the garment sector together with construction, and services, in particular finance and
real estate, continues to propel growth. Overall macroeconomic management remains appropriate
but there are emerging challenges to external competitiveness, partly derived from U.S. dollar
appreciation and rising wages. Improving the business climate, reducing infrastructure, energy,
and skills bottlenecks, promoting private sector development and economic diversification,
improving governance and the delivery of public services and supporting rural development
continue to be essential to promote self-sustaining and inclusive growth.
 Managing public finances and debt. Fiscal policy remains the main instrument for
macroeconomic management given high dollarization. Prudent fiscal management is, therefore,

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

5

CAMBODIA

critical and needs to be underpinned by continued improvements in revenue collection, prioritized
spending, and better monitoring of contingent liabilities, including through the budgetary and
public debt management framework and further progress in budgetary transparency.
 Safeguarding financial system stability and improving the effectiveness of monetary policy.
Implementing the key recommendations of the 2010 FSAP remains critical to safeguarding
financial stability. These include implementing a moratorium on new bank licenses, strengthening
coordinated supervision, developing the foreign exchange market, improving the supervisory
capacity, enhancing efficient and stable payment system, improving quality of financial data, and
encouraging a close coordination among financial regulators. Financial stability risks from the
buoyant real estate markets need to be managed through strengthened supervision and
improved data collection. Developing an interbank market remains a necessary step for a
transition to more effective and market-based monetary policy operations.
 Improving governance. Both the World Bank and IMF have stressed the critical role of
governance in improving the quality of service delivery and fostering private sector development,
which is the engine of growth.
 The teams are committed to continue the close cooperation going forward. The table below
details the specific activities planned by the two country teams over the next 12-month period
along with their expected deliveries.

RELATIONS WITH THE ASIAN DEVELOPMENT BANK
(August 2016)
As of June 30, 2016, Cambodia has received $2.38 billion in Asian Development Bank (AsDB) lending,
grants, and technical assistance, including: (i) 80 Asian Development Fund (ADF) loan projects and
programs for $1,928.3 million with low interest; (ii) 2 Ordinary Capital Resources (OCR) loans for
$83.0 million; (iii) 21 ADF grants for $255.71 million; and (iv) 2 special fund grants for $6.0 million.
Cumulative disbursements to Cambodia for sovereign and non-sovereign lending and grants are
$1,670.0 million.
The sector composition of active lending, grants, and technical assistances totaling $1,071.1 million
comprises: (i) Agriculture, Natural Resources and Rural Development $284.2 million (27 percent);
(ii) Transport and Communications $197.8 million (18 percent); (iii) Water Supply and Urban
Infrastructure $181.5 million (17 percent); (iv) Multisector $137.0 million (13 percent); (v) Education
$101.4 million (9 percent); (vi) Industry and Trade $83.0 million (8 percent); (vii) Energy $45.0 million
(4 percent); (viii) Public Sector Management (PSM) $30.1 million (3 percent); and (ix) Health,
Nutrition and Social Protection $10.0 million (1 percent).
The AsDB Cambodia Country Partnership Strategy (CPS), 2014–2018, endorsed by the Board on
November 28, 2014, aligns with Cambodia’s strategic planning cycle and the priorities reflected in
the Rectangular Strategy for Growth, Employment, Equity and Efficiency, Phase III (RSIII) and the
National Strategic Development Plan (NSDP, 2014–2018). Consistent with the Royal Government of
Cambodia’s economic reform priorities, the impact of the CPS will be reduction in poverty and
vulnerability. The CPS embeds the three strategic agendas of the Midterm Review of Strategy 2020
into all AsDB operations: (i) inclusive economic growth; (ii) environmentally sustainable growth; and
(iii) regional cooperation and integration (RCI).
The 2014–18 CPS builds on two strategic pillars for AsDB’s activities in Cambodia: (i) rural-urbanregional links, and (ii) human and social development, and one facilitating pillar: PSM. Expanding
rural-urban-regional connectivity is an integrated approach to developing those areas where most
poor people live and focuses on transport and economic corridor development to link national value
chains with the region and the world. This pillar develops rural-urban-regional infrastructure
(including irrigation and water management, rural electrification, rural roads, rural water supply,
urban infrastructure, road maintenance, and trade facilitation) and supports the commercialization
of farms and competitiveness of agribusiness through improved connectivity. The second pillar,
targeted human and social development, supports access to, and the quality of, secondary
education, and targeted skills development through technical and vocational education and training
linked to evolving demands of the labor market. PSM covers decentralization and deconcentration
and public financial management reforms and acts as facilitating pillar to improve country and
sector governance and mitigate project-level fiduciary risks.
AsDB has been a leading development partner of the finance sector in Cambodia since 1999. A
comprehensive approach was required to rebuild the financial system in a devastated economy that

8

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

CAMBODIA

had no finance sector. The Third Financial Sector Program (FSP) (2011–2014) supported
implementation of recommendations of the 2010 Financial Sector Assessment Program (FSAP) and
initial stages of the government’s Financial Sector Development Strategy (FSDS), 2011–2020. After
successfully rebuilding the basic foundation of the banking industry under the First and Second FSP,
the Third FSP supported the sector’s expansion to cover the important subsectors of nonbanking
services and capital markets, and to boost investor’s and beneficiaries’ confidence in the system with
a stronger legal and regulatory framework, necessary infrastructure, and better quality of services,
including consumer protection. The Inclusive Financial Sector Development Program (2014-2020)
consists of three subprograms as part of implementation of the FSDP 2016–2025 and combined
with substantial TA, will support capacity development for several relevant government institutions.
First, the program is supporting the completion of a draft national strategy for financial inclusion for
rural areas, agriculture, and SME development. The program is also enhancing financial stability and
confidence, which represents a key prerequisite for financial inclusion. Finally, the program is
supporting finalization of draft laws and lay the foundation for strengthening financial system
infrastructure.
Under the CPS 2014–2018, AsDB’s private sector operations focus on finance sector development,
including private equity, transport, agribusiness, water supply and sanitation, and trade and supply
chain finance for SMEs. Investments in synergy with AsDB's public sector assistance is supported,
and TA is facilitating project development, reducing entry barriers, improving governance, and
develop capacity.
AsDB has assisted the government to review existing policies, laws, regulations, and institutional
arrangements for Public Private Partnerships (PPPs) and supported development of the Policy Paper
on PPPs For Public Investment Project Management. Under a capacity development technical
assistance project, AsDB is currently helping to build the institutional capacity of government
agencies which will be involved in developing future PPPs. Through a project preparatory technical
assistance, AsDB has in early 2016 started to support the government in establishing a legal and
institutional framework for development of PPPs, and will help to develop a pathfinder PPP project
pipeline and pilot project.

STATISTICAL ISSUES
(September 2016)
Assessment of Data Adequacy for Surveillance
General. Data provision is broadly adequate for surveillance. Extensive technical assistance (TA) has
been provided by the IMF, United Nations Development Programme, Asian Development Bank
(AsDB), and World Bank, as well as by bilateral partners, leading to substantial capacity
improvements. Despite the progress made in improving data statistics, several shortcomings in
macroeconomic data still hamper timely and comprehensive analysis.
National accounts. Despite improvements in recent years, weaknesses remain in the quality and
timeliness of national accounts data. The quality of GDP estimates remains hampered by the lack of
comprehensive and reliable source data on a production and expenditure basis, in part due to
resource constraints and weak data collection techniques. In November 2011, a TA mission assessed
current methodologies used to compile national accounts estimates and provided support with the
development of the quarterly national accounts estimates. In February 2014, another TA mission was
conducted mainly to assist the National Institute of Statistics (NIS) processing the results of
Cambodia’s first ever 2011 Economic Census of Cambodia (EC2011) for improving GDP estimates.
The purpose of the EC2011 was not particularly focused on national accounts, hence TA concluded
further improvements are needed to convert EC2011 data into national accounts data following the
System of National Accounts (SNA) concepts and definitions. The TA mission also assessed the
implementation of the previous mission recommendations and found that progress has stalled
partly due to resource constraints. Statistics Sweden has been assisting the NIS for improving the
national accounts compilation. In February 2015, a TA mission assessed current data compilation
and dissemination practices and made recommendations on these issues. An assessment/diagnostic
mission will be conducted in December 2016.
Price statistics. The compilation of the consumer price index (CPI) suffers from insufficient
geographic coverage. An updated CPI series was introduced starting in April 2012. Geographic
coverage of the series has been expanded to include Phnom Penh plus five provinces. An STA TA
mission visited Phnom Penh in April 2012 to assist with updating/improving the CPI. The authorities
indicated a need for assistance with developing a producer price index (PPI), but no funds have been
allocated to support the compilation of an ongoing PPI.
Government finance statistics (GFS). The Ministry of Economy and Finance began implementing
reforms to the government accounting system and budgetary nomenclature in 2007, based on the
Government Finance Statistics Manual (GFSM) 2001, with the assistance of the IMF. To facilitate
policy dialog, the authorities should consider shifting from the Tableau des opérations financières
de l’État (TOFE) based on GFSM 1986 to a GFSM 2014-based budget formulation and reporting
framework. Over the past three years, progress has been made, and the authorities submit annual
and monthly GFS data for budgetary central and local governments on a cash basis to the IMF’s
Statistics Department. Going forward, the priority is to improve data compilation, namely to compile

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

11

CAMBODIA

financial balance sheet, and extend institutional coverage to include data for extrabudgetary entities
and social security funds. Next steps include: (i) improving the CoA to allow automatic compilation
of GFSM 2014 summary statements and detailed tables in the FMIS; (ii) mapping available source
data on PAE to GFSM 2014 classifications; and (iii) reporting to the World Bank-IMF Public Sector
Debt Statistics database. A mission is planned by December 2016 to work on the implementation of
the next steps.
Monetary and financial statistics. The NBC reports monetary data using the standardized report
forms for the central bank and other depository corporations on a regular monthly basis. The NBC
received TA during the FSAP on the compilation of financial soundness indicators (FSIs). In
September 2015, another TA mission provided support for establishing procedures for compiling
FSIs. The NBC now compiles monthly core FSIs and several encouraged FSIs, and has begun
reporting them to the IMF on a regular basis since February 2016. Some data deficiencies and
inconsistencies continue to pose a challenge to the compilation of FSIs, including deficiencies on
sectoral classification.
External sector statistics. Cambodia’s quarterly balance of payments and international investment
position (IIP) are compiled by the NBC according to the Balance of Payments Manual, fifth edition
(BPM5). Data present some relevant shortcomings in terms of coverage, accuracy, and timeliness.
Balance of payments and IIP are compiled relying on estimation methods. Inward foreign direct
investment (FDI), a relevant component of Cambodia’s external transactions and positions presents
large gaps, especially in regard to real estate acquisitions by nonresidents, which are not included in
FDI although data are available. General Department of Customs and Excise (GDCE) produce
monthly and quarterly trade data. Monthly data are regularly provided to NBC to be used to
estimate balance of payments trade figures. A number of technical assistances has been provided
under the Project on Improvement of External Sector Statistics, funded by the government of Japan.
Recent progress has been made, especially in enhancing the International Transactions Reporting
System (ITRS) and in preparing draft FDI survey. A TA mission on FDI data collection will be
conducted in September 2016.
Data Standards and Quality
Cambodia participates in the IMF’s General Data Dissemination System. No data ROSC are available.

Statement by Mr. Mazrunisham Omar, Executive Director;
and Mr. Suasdey Chea, Advisor to the Executive Director on Cambodia
October 19, 2016

1.
The Cambodian authorities would like to express their gratitude for the constructive
discussions and exchange of views with staff on macroeconomic developments and policy
recommendations during the 2016 Article IV consultation. The authorities appreciated the
discussions on the need to effectively contain growing macro-financial risks, maintain fiscal
sustainability, and enhance their financial sector and structural reform agendas for more
sustainable and inclusive growth. The authorities broadly agree with staff’s assessment and
would take staff’s recommendations into consideration when formulating future policies.
Recent Economic Development and Outlook
2.
Cambodia’s economy remains strong, with growth projected to be around 7.0 percent
in 2016 and 2017, among the highest in Asia. Rapid economic growth has been supported by
significant increase in integration with the global economy and more importantly, has been
accompanied by an impressive decline in poverty from 50 percent in 2005 to 18 percent in
2012 and improved income distribution. Cambodia has successfully transitioned to a lowermiddle income status this year. This growth momentum is expected to remain robust,
underpinned by strong garments exports, as well as real estate and construction activities.
Cambodia’s transformation is guided by the Royal Government of Cambodia’s Rectangular
Strategy Phase III (RS III) and the National Strategic Development Plan 2014-2018, the
implementation of which is on track.
3.
Headline inflation picked up to 3.2 percent at end-2016 from 2.6 percent in 2015, due
to higher food and oil prices. Nonetheless, headline inflation is projected to remain low and
average around 3 percent over the medium term.
4.
Credit growth remains high, but has moderated from 34 percent in 2014 to 30 percent
in 2015, and is projected to continue slowing to around 25 percent in 2016 and 2017. The
authorities share staff’s views on the need to moderate the pace of credit growth to preserve
financial stability while at the same time are mindful of the need to support growth. In this
regard, the authorities are strengthening the financial regulatory framework, including the
macro-prudential policy and crisis management frameworks. The National Bank of
Cambodia (NBC) has recently introduced a Basel III-compliant liquidity coverage ratio to
strengthen liquidity regulations and align them with international standards.
5.
On the external front, the authorities expect the current account deficit to narrow to
9.7 percent in 2016 from 10.6 percent of GDP in 2015, due to reduced imports following the
completion of major hydropower projects, low commodity prices and increasing remittances.

2
Over the medium-term, the current account deficit is projected to narrow further to around 8
percent of GDP, supported by the completion of several hydropower projects, and increased
export and tourism receipts. Gross official reserves have increased to US$8 billion at endAugust, covering 4.6 months of total imports. The authorities are encouraged by sustained
FDI inflows and are committed to implement reforms to further enhance the business
environment and prioritize public investments in agriculture and transportation infrastructure
to promote economic diversification.
6.
The authorities’ welcome staff’s assessment that the growth outlook is broadly
positive but agree that it is subject to downside risks, particularly arising from the rapid credit
growth and the uncertain external environment. China’s rebalancing, which is expected to
result in lower growth in the near-term, appreciation of the US dollar, weaker growth in
Europe and a sharper-than-anticipated tightening in global financial conditions could impact
the economy and the financial system. The authorities remain vigilant of the downside risks
and continue to undertake measures and reforms to enhance macro-financial stability and
ensure sustainable growth.
Fiscal Policy
7.
Fiscal deficit is projected to widen to 2.6 percent of GDP in 2016 from 1.6 percent of
GDP in 2015, due to higher capital spending and public sector wage bill. Tax revenue
performance remains strong, and is projected to increase to 14.9 percent of GDP in 2016
from 14.6 percent in 2015. This is supported by the authorities’ efforts in strengthening
enforcement of the Revenue Mobilization Strategy (RMS), which resulted in improvement of
tax and customs administration.
8.
Over the medium term, the authorities are determined to prioritize expenditure and
further strengthen revenue mobilization and governance. They remain strongly committed to
the implementation of the RMS and recognize the need to rationalize investment incentives
and will further review other tax policies. On expenditures, the authorities are reviewing the
public expenditure framework and agree on the importance of developing a medium term
fiscal framework to improve expenditure allocation efficiency. Meanwhile, the wage bill
increases are being implemented cautiously to allow for capital expenditure for infrastructure
investment.
9.
The authorities have been continuously working on improving the monitoring of
contingent liabilities, particularly from public-private partnerships. In connection with this,
the authorities have designated a contingency fund account for contingent liabilities related to
enterprises in the power sector.
10.
While public debt has increased moderately, staff’s Debt Sustainability Analysis
indicates that Cambodia’s risk of debt distress remains low. The authorities are open to

3
developing the bond market, and are committed to maintaining adequate government
deposits, in order to ensure debt sustainability and secure stronger fiscal buffers, as well as to
ensure macroeconomic stability over the longer term.
Monetary Policy
11.
Cambodia’s monetary system is characterized by a high degree of dollarization and
cash-based economy that limits the NBC’s ability to implement monetary policy effectively.
The stabilization of the exchange rate against the US dollar continues to serve as an
important nominal anchor to help keep inflation low and stable. At the same time, the NBC is
fully committed to developing the interbank and money markets as well as the foreign
exchange market to promote the use of the local currency (Khmer Riel) in order to allow for
a more effective and flexible monetary policy framework. With regards to de-dollarization,
policies and action plans are being developed to promote greater use of the local currency,
and reduce dollarization in the long term.
12.
The reserve requirement ratio remains an important instrument of monetary and
prudential policy. It has been kept unchanged since the end of 2012 with the ratios of
12.5 percent for the foreign currency deposits and 8 percent for the local currency. Since
2013, in line with the Fund’s past recommendations, the NBC issued negotiable certificate of
deposits (NCDs), both in US dollar and Khmer Riel, to help develop the interbank market.
This has also helped facilitate banks’ liquidity management and market-based monetary
policy operations. In addition, reserve requirement on banks’ foreign borrowing was reimposed in March 2015 in order to better manage short-term capital inflows to the banking
system.
Financial Stability
13.
Cambodia has experienced a significant increase in financial deepening, with credit
growth averaging nearly 30 percent (year on year) over the past three years. Despite the
strong credit growth, core financial soundness indicators remain healthy with adequate
capitalization levels and high profitability, while credit quality remains sound. The
distribution of credit has been to a large extent, directed to productive sectors but the
authorities recognize growing exposure to the real estate and construction sectors which
represent potential pockets of vulnerabilities to financial stability.

Mindful of the risks, efforts are on-going to strengthen the financial regulatory and
supervision frameworks, and recently, several pre-emptive measures were introduced to
enhance the resilience of the financial system and rein in credit growth, including the reintroduction of the reserve requirement on bank borrowing from non-residents, raising the
minimum registered capital of banking and financial institutions, and implementing a BaselIII compliant liquidity coverage ratio. The NBC is also working on strengthening regulations

on asset classification and provisioning, and plans to upgrade solvency regulation. The NBC
is also considering imposing prudential measures on institutions deemed to be engaged in
excessive risk-takin. Going forward, the authorities will continue to closely monitor
developments on this front and take necessary prudential actions to curb credit growth and
maintain a sound financial system. The authorities are, however, mindful of the impact of
these measures on growth.
15.
The authorities are keenly aware that the microfinance sector is becoming more
systemically important and have stepped-up efforts to enhance the supervisory framework for
microfinance institutions. The NBC remains committed to a risk-based supervisory approach
that is consistent with the FSAP recommendations. To help enhance the crisis management
framework, the MoU on establishing information sharing was signed between the Ministry of
Economy and Finance, the NBC, and Securities Exchange Commission of Cambodia (SECC)
in 2014. The authorities have also continued to build capacity for their staff, and welcome
further technical assistance from the Fund in this area. The authorities are committed to
working closely with the Fund on identifying risks, improving data collection and enhancing
the crisis resolution framework for the financial sector.
Continuing the Reform Agenda
16.
In addressing structural bottlenecks, the authorities remain focused on public
investments in roads, railways, bridges and irrigation to further promote rural development
and enhance inclusive growth. Public investment in these infrastructure projects will help
crowd in private investment. Over the near term, the completion of several hydropower
projects will provide affordable electricity to the general population and contribute to
enhancing Cambodia’s business climate and competitiveness. Building on the improvements
in maternal health, early childcare and primary education programs in the rural areas, the
authorities will continue to remain actively engaged in the improvement and prioritization of
education and healthcare development. Moreover, the authorities are working on promoting
technical and vocational training, in order to address skill mismatches, which in turn will
strengthen productivity and further promote inclusive growth.
Conclusion
17.
Overall, the Cambodian authorities are committed to preserving macroeconomic and
financial stability, promoting sustainable and inclusive growth, and stand ready to implement
any measures deemed appropriate. The authorities are highly appreciative of the Fund’s
continued support in providing high-quality policy advice and technical assistance,
particularly in fiscal, monetary and financial sector policies. Going forward, the authorities
will continue to further improve their macroeconomic policy and financial sector regulatory
frameworks in line with the Fund’s policy recommendations.
