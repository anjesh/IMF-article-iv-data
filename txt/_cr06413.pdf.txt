This report is based on discussions held in Rabat during June 7-21, 2006. The
staff team consisted of Mr. Fanizza (head), Ms. Allain, Messrs. Bouhga-Hagbe and
Söderling, and Ms. Martin (EP) (all MCD).

•

Counterparts: The mission met with Minister Fathallah Oualalou (Finance and
Privatization), Minister Mustapha Mechahouri (External Trade), Minister Mohamed
Boussaid (Modernization of Public Services), Governor Abdellatif Jouahri (Bank
Al-Maghrib, BAM), and other government officials. The mission also met with the
head of the Finance Commission of the House of Representatives, and with
representatives from the banking sector. Mr. Daïri, Alternate Executive Director for
Morocco, joined the meetings.

•

Context of past surveillance: In recent years, the Fund and the authorities have
generally agreed on broad policy priorities—maintaining macroeconomic stability,
undertaking fiscal consolidation, liberalizing trade and strengthening the financial
sector. Fund staff has also encouraged the authorities to consider a gradual transition
to a flexible exchange rate regime. The authorities have generally favored a more
gradual approach to reform implementation than the Fund, in part to allow for time to
build a consensus around the reform agenda. The concluding statement of the 2006
Article IV mission was the first to be published on the websites of the Ministry of
Finance and of the central bank.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
•

Morocco has started to reap the benefits of its reform efforts, but raising living
standards to the levels observed in other emerging economies still constitutes a
challenge. Structural reforms have enhanced the overall productivity of the economy
and heightened its resilience to shocks. The macroeconomic environment,
characterized by low inflation and a comfortable reserves position, is sound, although
the fiscal position remains a concern for the medium term.

•

Macroeconomic conditions are strengthening, and there are no short-term policy
concerns. Growth is picking up and the current account is expected to record its sixth
consecutive surplus in 2006. The central bank has so far succeeded in preventing
protracted excess liquidity conditions from generating inflationary pressures. Recent
evidence suggests that the dirham, which is pegged to a currency basket dominated by
the euro, is not misaligned.

•

Banking conditions have improved. The authorities have implemented many of the
key recommendations of the 2003 Financial Sector Stability Assessment. In particular,
the restructuring process of the two troubled state-owned banks is almost complete.

Key Issues and Policy Discussions
•

Fiscal consolidation remains the top policy priority. The authorities have started
implementing their medium-term fiscal strategy, and the debt-to-GDP ratio has
declined. Looking forward, the success and credibility of the fiscal consolidation
strategy will depend on the authorities’ ability to curb wage bill growth, and reduce the
fiscal cost of oil and food subsidies. Tax reform is a priority, not only for revenue
collection, but also to reduce distortions and improve the business climate.

•

The 2007 budget should send a strong signal on the authorities’ commitment to
fiscal consolidation. A deficit target of 3.5 percent of GDP appears within reach.

•

Inefficiencies in the financial intermediation mechanism persist. The measures
implemented by the central bank to improve the availability, accuracy and transparency
of financial information are helpful in this regard. Further developing alternative
financing instruments—such as stock and bond markets—and improving the
mobilization of institutional savings could also enhance financial intermediation.

•

Morocco’s integration in the world economy is deepening. Morocco has made
considerable progress in trade liberalization; next steps include tackling remaining
obstacles to trade and increasing trade in services. The sectoral reforms taken to
prepare the economy to the challenges of globalization are producing results;
nevertheless, it is important to ensure that sectoral incentives do not create distortions.
Staff supports the authorities’ intention to prepare for an eventual transition to a more
flexible exchange rate regime. The central bank has started strengthening the monetary
policy framework, possibly with a view to adopting inflation targeting in the medium
term. Further fiscal consolidation and development of monetary and exchange markets
would help also ensure an orderly transition from the current currency-basket peg of
the dirham.

I. INTRODUCTION
1.
Morocco has started to reap the benefits of its reform efforts, but the growth
momentum needs to be sustained to transform Morocco into a buoyant emerging-market
economy and raise its living standards. Growth is becoming less dependent on agricultural
conditions, private investment is increasing, and inflation remains subdued. The short-term
outlook is favorable, and there are no major macroeconomic risks. However, Morocco’s percapita income is still lower than in more dynamic emerging market countries, and
unemployment remains high in urban areas.
2.
The 2006 Article IV discussions focused on three key elements of the authorities’
growth-accelerating strategy: (a) achieving medium-term fiscal consolidation; (b) enhancing
the efficiency of financial intermediation; and (c) deepening Morocco’s integration in the
global economy.
3.
Morocco continues to enjoy political stability, and the process of political and social
reform initiated by King Mohammed VI is taking hold. The implementation of the King’s
National Human Development Initiative has moved social issues to the center of the policy
agenda. The general elections scheduled for 2007 are unlikely to alter the authorities’
commitment to market-oriented reforms.
II. ACHIEVEMENTS AND KEY CHALLENGES
Morocco’s main challenge is to capitalize on recent achievements and to accelerate growth
to levels compatible with substantial poverty reduction and lower unemployment.
4.

The reform efforts undertaken since the mid-1990s have started to bear fruit.

•

The macroeconomic environment is sound, with low inflation and a comfortable
external position, although the fiscal position remains a concern for the medium term.

•

The authorities have successfully privatized and liberalized the telecommunications,
energy and transportation sectors. Moreover, Morocco has significantly liberalized its
trade regime and strengthened its financial sector. These reforms have enhanced the
overall productivity of the economy, and heightened its resilience to shocks.1 Despite
three adverse shocks—a drought, the dismantling of the Agreement on Textile and

than 5 percent in 2005.
•

Real per-capita GDP started to rise in 2000, putting an end to the previous decade’s stagnation.
Poverty has declined, but remains high, particularly in rural areas. Despite labor supply
pressures, the unemployment rate fell

The authorities agree that the time is
ripe to tackle the remaining impediments to
growth. Despite progress achieved, raising
living standards to the levels observed in other
emerging economies constitutes a challenge.
The authorities feel that the current favorable
economic environment provides a window of
opportunity to accelerate the reform process.

recovering. This improvement,
combined with continued strong tourism receipts and workers’ remittances, will offset
the upsurge in the energy bill. External reserves remain high ($18.4 billion as of
end-July 2006) and exceed the total stock of external debt. The standard debt
sustainability analysis indicates that external vulnerabilities are limited.

Monetary policy has adequately managed the excess liquidity conditions, and
price pressures remain subdued. Significant slack in economic activity persists in
spite of the recent upswing in domestic demand.2 Consumer prices are expected to
increase by 2.5 percent in 2006, up from 1 percent in 2005, reflecting mainly higher
energy prices. The new statutes of the central bank (Bank Al-Maghrib, BAM),

Morocco’s employers’ association estimates the capacity utilization rate at around 70 percent.

8
promulgated in early 2006, institutionalize its independence in the conduct of monetary
policy and enshrine price stability as its core mandate. In this context, BAM has
continued to strengthen the operational framework for monetary policy, notably by
incorporating repos in its policy toolkit and building a portfolio of government
securities. BAM’s recent decision to favor seven-day deposit auctions to mop up
excess liquidity has helped better anchor inflation expectations and halted the decline
in interbank interest rates, consistent with the ongoing recovery of domestic demand.3
The publication of a press release upon the completion of BAM’s board meetings also
heightened the transparency of monetary policy.
•

The fiscal position is improving but the public debt stock remains high. Despite a
buoyant revenue performance, the fiscal deficit is likely to be close to the budget target
of 4.1 percent of GDP (down from 5.9 percent in 2005) because of continued
expenditure pressures—stemming from high oil and food subsidies due to increased
international prices, the restructuring of the two public banks, transfers to the civil
servants’ pension fund, and new wage concessions, mostly in the education and health
sectors.4 Standard fiscal sustainability analysis indicate that Morocco’s public debt is
mostly sensitive to output shocks.

•

The financial sector has strengthened and remaining fragilities in the public
banks are being addressed. The authorities have implemented many key
recommendations of the 2003 Financial Sector Stability Assessment. The 2006 banking
law broadens BAM’s supervisory authority to nonbank financial institutions. The
write-off of a substantial number of nonperforming loans has strengthened the balance
sheet of the banking sector. The restructuring process of the two troubled state-owned
banks is almost complete. As a result, their capital-adequacy ratio should improve in
2006, and satisfy the minimum requirement by 2007.

3

Until May 2006, BAM had mopped up liquidity mainly through its 24-hour deposit facility, which pays a
lower interest rate.
4

This is the fiscal deficit on a commitment basis, excluding expenditures from the special investment fund,
Fonds Hassan II, which are projected to reach 0.7 percentage points of GDP in 2006.

The medium-term outlook is favorable. Nonagricultural GDP is projected to grow
by 5.5 percent on average over the next five years, with annual inflation at 2 percent.5 This
scenario is consistent with a modest increase in total factor productivity, in line with the trend
observed during the last cycle.6 Despite strong remittances flows (8.6 percent of GDP on
average in 2006–11), the pickup in economic activity is expected to turn the current account
surplus into a small deficit in the outer years.7 Private investment is projected to increase,
while fiscal consolidation should strengthen public savings.

Agricultural GDP projections are based on historical performance and small productivity improvements.

IV. THREE KEY ISSUES FOR GROWTH
In the absence of major macroeconomic risks, policy discussions focused on three key
elements of the authorities’ strategy for sustained job-creating growth: (a) achieving
medium-term fiscal consolidation; (b) enhancing the efficiency of financial intermediation;
and (c) deepening Morocco’s integration in the global economy, including further trade
reform and the design of a medium-term strategy for exiting the currency-basket peg of the
dirham.
A. Fiscal Consolidation and Medium-Term Fiscal Strategy
Background
8.
Fiscal consolidation is the authorities’ top policy priority. Sizeable privatization
flows and abundant liquidity have allowed Morocco to finance its past deficits with relative
ease. The dwindling of potential sources of privatization proceeds and the still high level of
public debt require an acceleration of the consolidation effort. By cementing private sector
confidence, creating the fiscal space for productive public expenditure and cushioning the
impact of exogenous shocks, fiscal consolidation is also key to support Morocco’s
transformation into a vibrant emerging-market economy.
9.
The authorities pointed out that they have started to implement their medium-term
fiscal consolidation strategy, which relies on a mix of expenditure and revenue measures. On
the expenditure side, their strategy rests on:
¾

Reducing wage bill growth;

11
¾

Reducing the fiscal cost of energy subsidies by gradually adjusting domestic
petroleum prices to international prices;

¾

Gradually replacing inefficient food subsidies with targeted support to vulnerable
groups; and

¾

Switching to performance-based budgeting within a medium-term expenditure
framework.

On the revenue side, the objectives are to improve the transparency and efficiency of the tax
system, particularly of the VAT, and strengthen domestic revenue mobilization to offset
revenue losses from continued trade
liberalization.

Authorities’ Views and Policy Intentions
11.
The authorities believe that sustainable expenditure savings are only possible if the
overall efficiency of public spending improves. As a consequence, they have adopted a
gradual approach to fiscal consolidation.
•

A broad civil service reform will help to gradually curb wage bill growth.
Successful implementation of the DVR and a continued no-new-net hiring policy
should reduce the wage bill by 1.4 percent of GDP to 12.2 percent of GDP in 2006.
Going forward, the adoption of merit-based promotions and remunerations and the
harmonization of civil service statutes would prevent ad hoc wage adjustments, which
boosted the wage bill in the past.

•

Upstream sectoral reforms are a prerequisite for the reform of the subsidy
system. The authorities believe that the current subsidy system is inefficient. They

Bank support, which will help reduce the fiscal cost of energy subsidies (1.6 percent of
GDP in 2005). The authorities plan on continuing to gradually align consumer prices
with international prices in order to allow for their eventual liberalization. They pointed
out that, following the three
Fuel Prices, end of June 2006 (in US dollars per liter)
increases (totaling 22 percent on
2.0
average) that have taken place since
1.6
2005, domestic prices for petroleum
products are high by international
1.2
standards. The authorities are
designing a strategy to reduce the
0.8
cost of food subsidies (0.8 percent
0.4
of GDP in 2005) by better targeting
them to the most vulnerable groups.

the authorities stressed the need to
build a consensus around this strategy.
By establishing a level-playing field and reducing distortions, the ongoing reform
of the tax system should durably improve revenue collection. The authorities have
started to simplify the tax system and increase its transparency by presenting the first
report on tax expenditures with the 2006 budget, and by publishing a tax procedure, as
well as a tax assessment and collection manual. They have also prepared a mediumterm plan to reduce the number of VAT rates, and started to broaden its base with the
2006 budget.

Objectives: Reduce the size of the civil service and curb wage bill growth.

39,500 employees (8 percent of the civil service) left under the voluntary program.
Three-quarters of those leaving the civil service were older than fifty.

I.

Program cost: DH 11. 4 billions (2.5 percent of GDP), to be recouped in less than
3 years in the form of wage bill savings. The government will also transfer
DH 2 billions each year to the pension fund during 2006–09 to compensate for
forgone contributions.

¾

Expected net total gain: DH 17 billions (3.7 percent of GDP) in net present value
terms.

12.
The authorities’ medium-term objective is to reduce the fiscal deficit to 3 percent of
GDP and to bring the public-debt-to-GDP ratio below 60 percent.

13
•

The 2007 budget law will seek a deficit reduction of about ½ a percentage point of
GDP.

•

In the medium-term, the wage bill should decrease from 13.5 percent of GDP to less
than 10 percent in 2011, and the budgetary cost of subsidies would be halved, reaching
1.3 percent of GDP in 2011. This reduction in current spending would create room for
substantially higher capital spending. The increased efficiency of domestic tax
collection should help offset the revenue shortfall stemming from trade liberalization,
leaving the tax revenue intake broadly unchanged.

•

The resulting improvement in the primary balance would be the main driving force
behind the reduction on the public debt-to-GDP ratio.
B. Enhancing Financial Intermediation

Background
13.
The increase in banking spreads in a context of monetary easing points to
inefficiencies in the financial intermediation mechanism. Banking sector assets rose by
almost 30 percentage points of GDP over the last decade to reach 94 percent of GDP in 2005.
As monetary conditions eased, the interbank and deposit rates fell by over 400 basis points,
but the spread between banks’ deposit and lending rates increased between 1998 and 2005.

Authorities’ Views and Policy Intentions
14.
The authorities stressed that the ongoing reforms have already increased the
economy’s capacity to absorb liquidity. The recent upsurge in certain types of credit—
particularly in the real estate sector—attests to this improvement.
•

The presence of a sizeable portfolio of nonperforming loans weighed heavily on the
cost of credit in the past. The recent cleaning up of banks’ balance sheets has helped
alleviate this problem.

BAM has sought to improve the availability, accuracy, and transparency of the
financial information available to potential lenders by (a) standardizing the minimum
data required to process loan applications; (b) helping banks to develop their practice
of internal rating systems; and (c) merging existing information on credit risk into a
privately managed centralized database accessible to all credit institutions. BAM has
also launched a bank survey in order to improve its monitoring of the changes in credit
conditions.

The Treasury is strengthening the performance of existing guarantee funds to facilitate
access to credit, particularly for small and medium enterprises.
C. Deepening Integration in the World Economy

Background
16.
Morocco has made considerable

progress in trade liberalization. Most of
60
the provisions of the free trade agreement

with the European Union (EU), Morocco’s

mid-2006, allows for cross rules of origin
among the four partners vis-à-vis the EU. Bilateral free-trade agreements with Turkey and
the USA entered into force on January 1, 2006. However, trade flows have not increased very
much, showing that obstacles to trade persist, and multilateral tariffs remain high.
17.
The authorities have also taken a number of steps to prepare the economy to the
challenges of globalization.

15
•

The strengthening of infrastructure—particularly highways and ports—and
liberalization efforts in the electricity, transport and telecommunications sectors are
expected to generate substantial productivity gains, and enhance Morocco’s
attractiveness to investors.

•

The authorities have also designed a number of sectoral reforms. The Plan Azur has
supported the expansion of the tourism sector. The Plan Emergence, finalized at
end-2005, aims both at modernizing the existing industrial sectors, such as the textile
industry, and facilitating the expansion of new industrial sectors and service activities.
In an effort to foster the development of offshoring activities, the authorities have
implemented a broad range of incentives, including tax incentives, and the outfitting of
four offshore zones.

•

The authorities have indicated their intention to prepare for a possible exit from the
currency-basket peg of the dirham.

Authorities’ Views and Policy Intentions
18.
The authorities are determined to maximize the benefits of existing free trade
agreements.
•

To align market conditions with those prevailing in the EU and comply with EU
requirements, the authorities have adopted legislation on the recognition of norms,
industrial property, and consumer protection.

•

To reduce the risk of trade diversion, the authorities have lowered MFN tariffs on
goods already freely traded with the EU.

•

Following the November 2005 Algiers conference on trade facilitation in the Maghreb,
co-organized with the Fund, an action plan to facilitate payment arrangements, combat
smuggling, and harmonize trade regulations and rules of origin on a region wide scale
should be approved in 2006. The regional conference on financial integration in the
Maghreb, to be held in Rabat at end-2006, will complement these efforts.

19.

Increasing trade in services is the next step in the liberalization strategy.

•

Morocco has already submitted a proposal for the liberalization of services to the
World Trade Organization.

•

The country has participated to the launching of the framework protocol for the
liberalization of services within the Euromed following the March 2006 Marrakesh
meeting.

20.
The existing currency-basket peg of the dirham has served the Moroccan
economy well, and remains appropriate. Going forward, a gradual move toward a flexible
exchange rate could help ensure the success of Morocco’s integration in the world economy.

16
The authorities have already taken steps to prepare for a possible move to more exchange
rate flexibility.
•

The Ministry of Finance and BAM are working together to explore issues related to the
exchange rate regime, the deepening of exchange and financial markets, and foreign
exchange regulations.

•

BAM is further strengthening the monetary policy framework, possibly with a view to
adopting inflation targeting in the medium term. In this context, it has engaged in
analytical research on various fronts to enhance its understanding of money demand,
the monetary policy transmission mechanism, and to fine tune its inflation projections,
including through the development of a core inflation indicator. The authorities have
expressed their interest to organize a regional conference on inflation targeting in 2007,
in cooperation with the Fund.
V. STAFF APPRAISAL

21.
Achievements. Morocco is reaping the rewards from the structural reforms it has put
in place during the last decade. Per capita income has been rising steadily since the beginning
of the century, nonagricultural growth is taking off, and macroeconomic conditions remain
stable.
22.
Challenges. Morocco needs to sustain and improve upon its recent good economic
performance to raise living standards, absorb the increasing labor supply, and lower poverty,
which remains unacceptably high. The authorities should not miss the opportunity of a
broadly favorable environment to step up the reform efforts. The objective is to transform
Morocco into a vibrant emerging-market economy by tackling the remaining impediments to
growth.
23.
Outlook and Risks. The recovery in economic activity seems well underway, and
there are no signs of overheating. Over the medium term the main risks are largely policy
related. The productivity gains necessary to further lift nonagricultural growth may not
materialize unless the momentum in structural reforms is sustained. Leaving the remaining
vulnerabilities unaddressed, particularly on the fiscal side, may harm the credibility of public
policies and make Morocco less attractive to investors.
24.
Fiscal Consolidation. Recent fiscal developments are encouraging, but highlight the
need to bring spending under tighter control. In fact, higher-than-envisaged outlays on wage
increases and energy and food subsidies have fully absorbed the gains from the strong
revenue performance. Looking forward, the success and the credibility of the fiscal
consolidation strategy will depend on avoiding that new wage concessions erode the savings
that the early retirement program should generate. Energy and food subsidies constitute a
heavy budgetary burden that Morocco cannot afford. Staff welcomes the intention to
overhaul the subsidy system in the context of broader reforms. Nevertheless, immediate
action is needed to curb the cost of these subsidies, given the prospects for both international
oil and sugar prices. The authorities should continue to gradually raise retail energy prices
and put a ceiling on the subsidy spending for sugar consumption. The strong revenue

17
performance reflects significant improvements in tax administration that have offset the
revenue impact of lower external tariffs. However, this favorable outcome should not slow
down the pace of tax reform. Reforming the tax system remains a priority not only to
mobilize resources, but also to limit the distortions created by a complex tax system and
improve the business environment.
25.
The 2007 budget. The 2007 budget should send a strong signal on the authorities’
commitment to fiscal consolidation by locking in wage bill savings, limiting outlays for
subsidies, and maintaining the strong revenue performance. A deficit target of 3.5 percent of
GDP appears within reach and consistent with the medium-term objective of bringing the
government debt-to-GDP ratio below 60 percent.
26.
Monetary Policy. BAM has so far succeeded in preventing protracted excess liquidity
from generating inflationary pressures. However, as the recovery takes hold, it will have to
continue to monitor inflation developments closely and take action if needed. In this sense,
the recent decision to use seven-day deposit auctions to mop up liquidity appears appropriate
to bring to a halt the decline in interbank interest rates, which would have not been justified
by the ongoing recovery. Staff welcomes BAM’s increased independence and its efforts to
enhance its analytical capabilities in view of the possible adoption of an inflation targeting
framework over the medium term.
27.
Exchange Rate. The currency-basket peg of the dirham has helped Morocco to
preserve macroeconomic stability. However, staff supports the authorities’ intention to
prepare for the possible transition to a more flexible exchange rate regime. This transition
would help to integrate Morocco in the global economy by avoiding the risks of either an
overvalued or an undervalued exchange rate as the economy faces external shocks and
undergoes structural transformation. To ensure an orderly transition, the authorities should
achieve further fiscal consolidation, and continue to develop monetary and exchange
markets. Moreover, a strong monetary policy transmission mechanism will require absorbing
the existing liquidity overhang. Targeted measures toward further capital account
liberalization could help develop the foreign exchange market. Fund technical assistance
could be provided to help the authorities in designing a detailed strategy for further
liberalizing capital flows, including the supporting reforms and the appropriate sequencing.
28.
Financial Intermediation. The reform of the financial sector has achieved significant
results and financial sector vulnerabilities have abated. Enhancing the functioning of the
judiciary system to expedite the recovery of claims and harmonizing tax and prudential
provisioning rules could further buttress the banking system. The further development of
alternative financing instruments, such as stock and bond markets, could encourage banks to
work more with small and medium enterprises and enhance the efficiency of financial
intermediation. Moreover, enhancing the mobilization of institutional savings could help to
lengthen the maturity of the resources available to finance the economy. The planned
regional conference on financial integration in the Maghreb, organized with Fund assistance,
will constitute a good venue to exchange views on the best practices on these issues in the
region.

18
29.
The Plan Emergence. The wide array of measures taken to better adapt the Moroccan
economy to the challenges of globalization appear to have already borne fruits, notably for
offshoring activities. Nevertheless, it is important that sectoral incentives do not further
complicate the tax system and create distortions.
30.
Trade Liberalization. Progress toward multilateral liberalization needs to
complement the ongoing bilateral and regional liberalization efforts to minimize trade and
investment diversions. The coming into effect of the Agadir agreement should allow
Morocco to exploit the benefits of cross rules of origin in the region vis-à-vis the EU. Staff
welcomes the authorities’ intention to implement the action plan to reduce remaining
obstacles to trade, as agreed at the Algiers conference on trade facilitation in the Maghreb.
31.
It is recommended that the next Article IV consultation take place on the standard
12-month cycle.

1/ Derived as [r - g - r(1+g) + ea(1+r)]/(1+g+r+gr) times previous period debt stock, with r = nominal effective interest rate on external debt; r = change in domestic GDP deflator in US dollar terms,
g = real GDP growth rate, e = nominal appreciation (increase in dollar value of domestic currency), and a = share of domestic-currency denominated debt in total external debt.
2/ The contribution from price and exchange rate changes is defined as [-r(1+g) + ea(1+r)]/(1+g+r+gr) times previous period debt stock. r increases with an appreciating domestic currency
(e > 0) and rising inflation (based on GDP deflator).
3/ For projection, line includes the impact of price and exchange rate changes.
4/ Defined as current account deficit, plus amortization on medium- and long-term debt, plus short-term debt at end of previous period.
5/ The key variables include real GDP growth; nominal interest rate; dollar deflator growth; and both non-interest current account and non-debt inflows in percent of GDP.
6/ Long-run, constant balance that stabilizes the debt ratio assuming that key variables (real GDP growth, nominal interest rate, dollar deflator growth, and non-debt inflows in percent of GDP)
remain at their levels of the last projection year.

Real GDP growth (in percent)

1/ Indicate coverage of public sector, e.g., general government or nonfinancial public sector. Also whether net or gross debt is used.
2/ Derived as [(r - p(1+g) - g + ae(1+r)]/(1+g+p+gp)) times previous period debt ratio, with r = interest rate; p = growth rate of GDP deflator; g = real GDP growth rate;
a = share of foreign-currency denominated debt; and e = nominal exchange rate depreciation (measured by increase in local currency value of U.S. dollar).
3/ The real interest rate contribution is derived from the denominator in footnote 2/ as r - π (1+g) and the real growth contribution as -g.
4/ The exchange rate contribution is derived from the numerator in footnote 2/ as ae(1+r).
5/ For projections, this line includes exchange rate changes.
6/ Defined as public sector deficit, plus amortization of medium and long-term public sector debt, plus short-term debt at end of previous period.
7/ The key variables include real GDP growth; real interest rate; and primary balance in percent of GDP.
8/ Derived as nominal interest expenditure divided by previous period debt stock.
9/ Assumes that key variables (real GDP growth, real interest rate, and other identified debt-creating flows) remain at the level of the last projection year.

ANNEX: SUMMARY OF ANNEXES
The full annexes to this report can be viewed in Cyber Docs on the Fund’s intranet and on
the secure extranet for Executive Directors and member officials.
Fund Relations
Morocco has no outstanding purchases or loans. The latest financial arrangement—a
Stand-By facility—expired on March 31, 1993. Morocco has a conventional peg
arrangement; the central exchange rate of the Moroccan dirham is pegged to a basket of
currencies representing Morocco’s principal trading partners. The 2005 Article IV
consultation was concluded by the Executive Board on August 29, 2005
(IMF Country Report No. 05/418).
Relations with the World Bank Group
As of August 2006, the World Bank’s portfolio in Morocco consists of 13 operations with a
total net commitment of $823.7 million and an undisbursed balance of $549.3 million.
Recent loans targeted the housing sector, rural water supply and sanitation, rural roads, and
the financial and public administration sectors. The quality of the portfolio has improved
over the last five years, and is generally satisfactory. The last Country Assistance Strategy
(CAS) report was approved by the Bank Board in May 2005; its main objectives are to:
(a) improve competitiveness and the investment climate; (b) increase access to basic services
by the poor and marginalized groups; (c) improve the efficiency of the education system; and
(d) improve water management and access to water services and sanitation.
Statistical Issues
Morocco subscribed to the Special Data Dissemination Standard in December 2005, and its
data provision for surveillance purposes is adequate overall. The authorities are working on
rebasing the national accounts from 1980 to 1998, and the new series of accounts covering
the years 1998–2004 should be released during 2006. The planned inclusion of free trade
zones and offshore banks will significantly improve the quality of balance-of-payment
statistics.

Exchange Rate Arrangement and Exchange System
Morocco maintains an exchange system that is free of restrictions on the making of payments
and transfers on current international transactions. However Morocco maintains certain
restrictions relating to Iraq and the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (Serbia and Montenegro),
pursuant to UN Security Council Resolutions. These are subject to notification to the Fund in
accordance with Decision 144 (52/51). The exchange rate is freely determined in the
interbank foreign exchange market which was created in 1996. Bank Al-Maghrib (BAM)
intervenes in the market to maintain the exchange rate within its target range, defined around
a fixed central rate. Morocco has a conventional peg arrangement. The current exchange rate
of the Moroccan dirham is pegged to a basket of currencies representing Morocco’s principal
trading partners. In 2001, the authorities changed the basket of currencies by increasing the
weight of the Euro to better reflect the weight of external trade with EU countries. BAM
fixes daily rates for the rated currencies on the basis of variations on the value of the basket.
Rates for most currencies quoted in Morocco are established on the basis of the daily
dirham-euro rate and the cross rates for those currencies in relation to the euro in the
international exchange markets. As of August 18, 2006, the SDR/dirham exchange rate was
SDR 1=DH 12.87.
Article IV Consultation
Morocco is on the 12-month cycle. The last discussions of the Article IV consultation were
held in Rabat during April 25-May 10, 2005, and were concluded by the Executive Board on
August 29, 2005.

ANNEX II. FINANCIAL RELATIONS WITH THE WORLD BANK
(As of August 7, 2006)
32.
The Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) was approved by the World Bank Board on
May 19, 2005. It plans to contribute to the broad goals of accelerating sustainable
employment-generating growth and reducing poverty and marginalization. It will focus upon
four objectives: (a) improve competitiveness and the investment climate; (b) increase access
to basic services by the poor and marginalized groups; (c) improve the efficiency of the
education system; and (d) improve water management and access to water services and
sanitation.
33.
The World Bank’s current portfolio in Morocco consists of 13 operations, with a total
net commitment of US$823.7 million and an undisbursed balance of US$549.3 million.
Bank lending is a mix of investment loans, SWAPs, and development policy loans (DPL).
Recent loans include Housing Sector DPL (US$150 million); Financial Sector DPL
(US$200 million); Rural Water Supply and Sanitation (US$60 million); Public
Administration Development Policy Loan (US$120 million); and Rural Roads II (US$60
million).
34.
For FY06, disbursements for DPLs and investment projects amount to
US$214.2 million and US$60.2 million, respectively. The disbursement ratio for investment
projects has improved, and is currently at 14.5%. The quality of the portfolio has generally
been satisfactory and there are no risky projects. Despite recent improvements in the quality
of the portfolio, institutional capacity for project implementation still needs to be
strengthened. A participatory Country Portfolio Performance Review (CPPR) is planned for
end-2006 in order to accelerate disbursement and to reassess progress made on key actions
agreed upon to improve project and portfolio management.
35.
A new Country Economic Memorandum (CEM), done in collaboration with Fund
staff, was finalized in March 2006 and has been largely discussed with the Government.
Dissemination is ongoing with wide participation from the private sector, academia and civil
society. The preparation of the CEM came in response to a request from the Government to
identify the major constraints to growth and devise a growth and competitiveness enhancing
agenda. It is in line with the CAS objectives to support the Government’s reforms for a
private environment conducive to faster growth and increased employment creation.
36.
Prospects for lending are significantly improving and specific requests have been
made for budget support and investment projects. Projects under preparation include: an
Energy Sector DPL (US$100 million), Water DPL (US$100 million), National Human
Development Initiative (US$200 million), Oum Er Rbia Water Resource Conservation
(US$60 million), Meknes Local Development (US$30 million), and Public Administration
Reform III DPL. The Bank and the Moroccan authorities are also discussing a possible
follow-up operation to address the growth constraints identified by the CEM.

32
37.
Other recent analytical and advisory work includes studies on Housing,
Competitiveness and ICT, Water Sector, Trade and Transport, and Wheat, Flour
Compensation Reform. The Investment Climate Assessment was disseminated in March
2006 and as a follow-up the bank is launching work on land tenure as a constraint to private
sector development and investment. Current studies include: Employment and Skills
Development, Housing PSIA, Urban Transport, Doing Business and ICT, Land Markets and
Growth, Decentralization and EU Neighborhood. The Bank is also providing strong support
with participatory approaches (Programmatic Economic and Sector Work-PESW) for
Tertiary Education, Public Administration Reform, Poverty, and Water.

33
ANNEX III. STATISTICAL ISSUES
Available economic and financial data have been provided to the staff on a regular basis and
most of these data are also published or made available on publicly accessible web sites. Data
provision is adequate for surveillance purposes.
A data ROSC mission, which took place in January 2002, carried out a review of the
macroeconomic statistics. As the authorities maintained a strong interest in subscribing to the
SDDS, the mission also identified areas to be strengthened to meet the SDDS requirements.
A subsequent mission (April–May 2005) noted that the authorities meet most of the SDDS
requirements in terms of coverage, periodicity, and timeliness. The mission proposed an
action plan to address the remaining issues, which enabled Morocco to subscribe to the
SDDS in December 2005.
Real sector
The Statistical Office is working on rebasing national accounts from 1980 to 1998 and on
bringing it in conformity with the System of National Accounts 1993. This reform program
has made good progress and the first series of accounts for 1998–2000 has been finalized.
The new series of accounts covering the period 1998–2004 will be released during 2006 once
the work on the years 2001–04 is completed. The revision of the consumer price index is also
planned to be completed during 2006, with updated weights based on the results of the 2001
household budget survey. A consistent monthly time series for the producer price index (with
weights derived from the 1997 annual survey) are available.
Government finance
Central government finance data are generally available with a few months lag. GFS data
reported for publication in the GFS Yearbook are not timely (the most recent data relate
to 2005), and their coverage is limited to the budgetary central government, the Moroccan
pension fund, and the National Social Security Fund. The reporting of data for the central
government on a monthly or quarterly basis for publication in IFS is irregular. A technical
assistance STA mission in February 1999 and a follow-up mission in February 2000 advised
on improvements in the compilation of both central and local government statistics and
assisted the government in establishing appropriate consolidation procedures for a
presentation of general government data. Substantial progress has been made by the
Accounting Office for the compilation of local government data and their consolidation with
central government budgetary data. The actual use of those source data for general
government compilation may require further clarification of responsibilities between various
directorates. Regarding the monthly Treasury’s Expenditure and Revenue Table, the data
ROSC recommended some reclassifications (e.g. transfers and privatization), to maintain the
Fonds Hassan II within the coverage of the table, and, for dissemination purposes, to
complement the table with more details and data on financing and to improve the format of
dissemination. The SDDS mission prepared an action plan for the production of data on the
consolidated general government operations.

34
Monetary and financial statistics
Bank Al-Maghrib disseminates monetary and financial and other macroeconomic statistics to
the general public primarily through its website (www.bkam.ma). The statistical part of the
site includes web-based versions of the Bank’s weekly, monthly, quarterly, and annual
publications. The degree of detail in the breakdown of financial assets and liabilities by
resident institutional sector could be more extensive; at present, this problem is reflected in
the lack of precision in some of the monetary aggregates, including credit indicators.
Balance of payments
The ROSC mission found that in general the balance of payments data are in line with the
concepts and definitions set out in the fifth edition of the Balance of Payments Manual
(BPM5). However, further work is needed to implement certain recommendations on scope,
classification, and basis for recording. Thus, recent measures to exclude the effects of
changes in exchange rates from the valuation of transactions in reserve assets should be
continued, and transactions in foreign currency assets and liabilities of intermediary banks at
their correspondent banks should be excluded from transactions in reserve assets. Also, the
Office des Changes (OC) is planning to treat operators in free trade zones as residents.
Offshore banks located in Morocco should also be considered residents. The OC lacks a firm
legal basis for compiling and disseminating balance of payments statistics, relying for the
time being exclusively on customs and exchange control data. These data are gradually to
become less available and too limited as liberalization proceeds and as participation of
foreign investors in the economy increases. The OC has initiated legislative measures that
would give it access to statistical data collected directly from economic operators, to record,
among other things, private foreign debt, and more generally of the international investment
position. Furthermore, the ROSC mission recommended the introduction of quarterly surveys
of enterprises and other agencies to improve the scope, classification, and valuation of
balance of payments transactions, in particular for goods for processing, transportation
services, and financial transactions. Since May 1998, the OC has been publishing, on its
internet site, monthly statistics on trade, tourism, private transfers, and incoming foreign
direct investment in accordance with the BPM5. The quality of balance of payments statistics
will significantly improve with the planned inclusion of free trade zones and offshore banks
located in Morocco or in its economic territory.
The latest BOP and IIP information received from Morocco, and published in the IFS, relates
to quarterly BOP data for 2004 and annual IIP data for 2004. Furthermore, Morocco reports
on a regular basis international liquidity data to STA for publication in the IFS.

Statement by the IMF Staff Representative
October 11, 2006
1.
This statement provides additional information that has become available since the
circulation of the staff report. It does not change the thrust of the staff appraisal.
2.
Recent data suggest that the economic recovery is gaining momentum. At
end-June, real GDP had grown by 8.5 percent year-on-year, boosted by a good harvest and
robust non-agricultural growth. The external position continues to strengthen. International
reserves reached $19.8 billion at end-August, up from $16 billion at end 2005, significantly
higher than projected. Preliminary data point to higher-than-anticipated tourism receipts as
one of the main factors behind this surge. The trade balance remains in line with staff
projections; in particular, Morocco’s main exports, textiles, continue to recover from their
2005 decline in the wake of the end of the Agreement on Textiles and Clothing. The recent
strengthening of the revenue performance, which may lead to a more favorable fiscal
outcome for the year as a whole, underscores the strength of the recovery. Investment and
domestic demand are also picking up, reflecting increased private sector confidence in the
Moroccan economy. The overall unemployment rate dropped to 7.7 percent in the second
quarter of 2006, its lowest level in more than two decades. Inflationary pressures remain
contained, with average inflation reaching 2.4 percent year-on-year at end-August.
3.
On September 2, 2006, the authorities increased the retail price of petroleum
products by about 5 percent on average. The authorities estimate the international price
level at which domestic retail prices would no longer be subsidized at $60 per barrel, up from
$56 before this latest increase.

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2006 Article IV Consultation
with Morocco
On October 11, 2006, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF)
concluded the Article IV consultation with Morocco.1
Background
Macroeconomic conditions continue to strengthen and the 2006 outlook is favorable,
with increased private sector confidence in the Moroccan economy. A bumper crop and
continued strong activity in services and construction are ushering in a recovery, following a
slowdown in growth in 2005 caused by unfavorable weather conditions. The external
current account is expected to record its sixth consecutive surplus. Strong tourism receipts,
workers’ remittances and the recovery of textile exports will offset the upsurge in the energy
bill. External reserves, at more than US$18 billion, continue to exceed the total stock of
public external debt. Price pressures remain subdued, and recent evidence suggests that
the dirham is not misaligned.
The fiscal position is improving but the ratio of public debt to GDP, though declining,
remains high. Despite a buoyant revenue performance, the fiscal deficit is likely to be close
to the 2006 budget target of 4.1 percent of GDP (down from 5.9 percent in 2005) because
of continued expenditure pressures stemming mainly from oil and food subsidies
(1.6 percent and 0.8 percent of GDP in 2005, respectively). The authorities have started to
implement their medium-term fiscal consolidation strategy, which aims at reducing the fiscal
1

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies.
On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by
the Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman
of the Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to
the country's authorities.

2

deficit to 3 percent of GDP and bring the public-debt-to-GDP ratio below 60 percent.
The successful 2005 voluntary early retirement scheme should help curb wage bill growth.
Following the three increases that have taken place since 2005, the authorities plan on
continuing to gradually align domestic prices of petroleum products with international prices.
They are also designing a strategy to reduce the fiscal cost of food subsidies by better
targeting them to the most vulnerable groups.
Monetary policy has adequately managed the excess liquidity conditions, and the central
bank continues to strengthen the operational framework for monetary policy and its
transparency.
Banking sector conditions have improved following significant write-offs of nonperforming
loans and the near completion of the restructuring of two state-owned banks.
The authorities have also taken steps to improve the availability, accuracy and transparency
of financial information in order to strengthen financial intermediation.
Morocco has made considerable progress in trade liberalization; next steps include tackling
remaining obstacles to trade and increasing trade in services.
Morocco subscribed to the Special Data Dissemination Standard in December 2005,
and continues to improve the quality and dissemination of statistical data and increase the
transparency of economic policy. The authorities published the recent staff mission
statement and intend to publish the 2006 Article IV Staff Report.
Executive Board Assessment
Directors agreed with the thrust of the staff appraisal. They commended the authorities on
their implementation of sound macroeconomic policies and structural reforms. Directors
noted that, in recent years, these policies had supported the acceleration of non-agricultural
growth in an environment characterized by low inflation and comfortable international
reserves, and the steady rise of per capita income.
Directors viewed that, with macroeconomic conditions strengthening, short-term prospects
are favorable. They shared the authorities’ view that the current sound macroeconomic
environment provides an opportunity to capitalize on recent achievements and advance the
reform process in order to accelerate growth to levels that would support an increase in
employment and a substantial reduction in poverty. To this end, Directors supported a
strategy of medium-term fiscal consolidation, enhancing the efficiency of financial
intermediation, and deepening Morocco’s integration into the global economy.
Directors noted that fiscal consolidation should be the top policy priority. They agreed that
Morocco’s fiscal strategy for gradually reducing the deficit to 3 percent of GDP over the
medium term is appropriate. Directors welcomed the ongoing reform of the tax system and
noted that a simpler and more transparent tax system and strengthened administration
would help broaden the tax base and increase revenue. While they congratulated the
authorities on the success of the 2005 early retirement program for civil servants, Directors
stressed that the credibility of the fiscal strategy will depend on the authorities’ ability to curb

3

wage bill growth and reduce the fiscal cost of oil and food subsidies. Directors urged the
authorities to seize the opportunity of the 2007 budget to send a strong signal on their
commitment to fiscal consolidation.
Directors supported the authorities’ intention to prepare for a possible transition to a more
flexible exchange rate regime. They welcomed the increased independence of the central
bank, and the central bank’s efforts to strengthen the monetary policy framework, with a
view to possibly adopting inflation targeting in the medium term. In this context, Directors
stressed the importance of further fiscal consolidation and development of money and
exchange markets.
Directors commended the authorities for having taken measures to strengthen the financial
sector, in line with the 2003 Financial Sector Stability Assessment, and welcomed the
emphasis placed on improving the efficiency of financial intermediation. They found that the
measures implemented by the central bank to improve the availability, accuracy,
and transparency of financial information were helpful in this regard. Directors encouraged
the authorities to develop further alternative financing instruments, such as stock and bond
markets. They looked forward to the adoption of the draft anti-money laundering law that
was submitted to parliament.
Directors welcomed Morocco’s progress achieved in trade liberalization, including active
participation in regional integration efforts, and supported the authorities’ policies to further
integration in the world economy. They agreed that appropriate next steps would be to
tackle remaining obstacles to trade and increasing trade in services.
It is expected that the next Article IV consultation with Morocco will take place on the
standard 12-month cycle.
Public Information Notices (PINs) form part of the IMF's efforts to promote transparency of
the IMF's views and analysis of economic developments and policies. With the consent of the
country (or countries) concerned, PINs are issued after Executive Board discussions of Article
IV consultations with member countries, of its surveillance of developments at the regional
level, of post-program monitoring, and of ex post assessments of member countries with
longer-term program engagements. PINs are also issued after Executive Board discussions of
general policy matters, unless otherwise decided by the Executive Board in a particular case.

Statement by Mohammed Daïri, Alternate Executive Director for Morocco
October 11, 2006
The Moroccan authorities are grateful to staff for the high quality of their work and the
excellent policy dialogue during the Article IV discussions. They appreciate the concise and
well-focused report and broadly agree with staff’s analysis and key policy recommendations.
They also thank management and the Board for their continued support.
The relentless efforts of the authorities in strengthening the economy’s fundamentals and its
resilience and improving the investment climate so as to increase growth and employment
continue to bear fruit. Indeed, sound macroeconomic policies and resolute implementation of
a broad range of structural reforms have contributed to improved economic performance. In
2005, the economy managed to withstand 3 major shocks: a severe drought, the dismantling
of textiles quotas, and the sharp increase in oil prices. While agricultural GDP declined by
18 percent, the overall growth performance turned out to be higher than expected (1.7 percent
as against 1 percent), as a result of higher nonagricultural GDP growth, confirming increased
resilience to weather conditions. The effect of the dismantling of textile quotas was
significant, although the initial decline in textile exports moderated thereafter. Finally, the oil
import bill increased by 51 percent (with an additional cost equivalent to 3 percent of GDP).
Despite the significant external shocks, the current account surplus increased to 2.2 percent
of GDP—thanks to strong performance of tourism and workers remittances—and foreign
reserves increased further to reach US$16.2 billion, covering 9 months of imports of goods
and services or 130 percent of total external debt. The fiscal deficit increased to 5.9 percent
of GDP mainly due to the one-off expenditure related to the voluntary retirement program
(DVR, 21⁄2 percent of GDP). Excluding the DVR, the overall deficit declined to 3.5 percent of
GDP from 4.6 percent in 2004. With skillful monetary policy in the context of the large
liquidity from foreign inflows, inflation further declined to 1 percent despite increases in the
domestic oil prices.
Economic performance improved further in 2006, reflecting continued adherence to sound
policies and favorable weather conditions. GDP growth is estimated to exceed 7 percent,
with non-agricultural GDP growing by 5 percent, and the external current account and
overall balance of payments positions are expected to strengthen further than was anticipated
during the Article IV discussions, with tourism receipts increasing significantly to take over
workers remittances as the main foreign exchange source after exports and a recovery of
textile shippings. Fiscal developments are also much better than anticipated and, with firm
control of expenditure and significantly improved revenue performance, compared to budget
estimates—and to the projections made during the Art IV discussions—the fiscal position is
expected to improve further in 2006. Following an exceptional increase in 2005 associated
with the recognition of past government arrears to the civil service pension fund and the
upfront cost of the DVR, the debt-to GDP ratio should resume its downward trend.
Moreover, unemployment dropped significantly, reaching in the second quarter of 2006 its
lowest level in decades. While inflation has trended upwards slightly, following increases in
domestic energy prices, it is the authorities’ firm intention to keep it under control.

2
The significantly improved tax revenue performance is a major achievement that is expected
to facilitate the authorities’ fiscal consolidation efforts. In 2005 alone, tax revenue increased
by close to 2 percent of GDP and the trend is continuing in 2006, as evidenced by data
through August, reflecting significant improvements in tax administration and policy, in line
with Fund’s technical assistance recommendations, and stronger economic activity. While
most of the revenue gains were realized at the domestic tax level, in particular in direct taxes
and the VAT, performance of taxes on international trade was also noteworthy in the context
of continued tariff reductions under Morocco-EU and other free-trade agreements. The
significant reduction in the Budget’s dependence on privatization revenue is also noteworthy
since it improves revenue predictability. On the expenditure side and despite its short term
budgetary cost, the DVR program will have a positive effect of close to 4 percent of GDP in
net present value terms, with a reduction in the wage bill (net of additional pension outlays)
in 2006 and over the medium-term. The authorities’ response to the large increase in
international oil prices was gradual, with temporary suspension of the price indexation
system, requiring temporary budget support, followed by step increases in domestic prices.
The indexation system has now been reinstated for most products and the September-2006
increase (the fourth since mid-2005) brought the domestic price structure for these products
in line with the prevailing international price. Domestic prices were reduced in early October
in consistence with the indexation formula and the decline in world prices. A strategy for the
energy sector will be developed with World Bank support.
The authorities are firmly committed to their medium-term fiscal consolidation strategy and
are confident that their target of reducing the fiscal deficit to 3 percent of GDP by 2009 will
be achieved, especially in view of recent progress in this area. The draft 2007 budget is
consistent with this strategy, with a deficit excluding privatization below 4 percent of GDP .
They stand ready to take action, if needed, to achieve their medium-term target, which is
crucial for long-term fiscal sustainability. Key elements of the strategy are: continued
improvement in tax revenue mobilization through further tax policy and administration
reform, including a reduction in exemptions, which should also allow some tax rate
reductions to improve the incentive structure; reducing the wage bill to a more sustainable
level, including through a policy of no new hiring on a net basis, harmonization of civil
service statutes, and adoption of merit-based promotion systems; and reforming the food
subsidy system to reduce its cost and improve its targeting. Additionally, budget
transparency, monitoring, and prioritization will be further strengthened, including through
performance-based budgeting, and the coverage of fiscal accounts will be expanded to
include local government.
Prudent monetary policy has been successful in managing the high liquidity generated by the
large tourism and workers’ remittance inflows and in maintaining low inflation without
unduly constraining private sector financing. Following enactment of the new central bank
Charter in early-2006, which enhanced its independence, Bank Al-Maghrib (BAM) is
implementing its strategic plan, including modernizing and upgrading its organization and
human resources and strengthening the monetary policy framework, with assistance from the
Fund and other central banks. The objective is to improve efficiency of monetary policy and
to prepare for a possible move to formal inflation targeting. Transparency of monetary policy

3
has also been enhanced through publication of a communiqué following meetings of the
BAM’s Board meetings, as prescribed under the new Charter.
The authorities concur with staff assessment that the current exchange rate regime continues
to serve the economy well and remains appropriate and that there is no sign of misalignment
of the dirham. Nevertheless, they remain open to considering the possibility of moving to a
more flexible exchange rate regime once all prerequisites are in place. These include, in
particular, further progress in fiscal consolidation, improving the soundness of the financial
sector and deepening of financial and exchange markets, and completion of the on-going
strengthening of the monetary policy framework.
The soundness of the financial sector has been significantly improved in line with FSAP
recommendations. The recently enacted banking law strengthens the supervisory and
regulatory authority of BAM and extends its coverage. The write-off of a significant share of
non-performing loans against accumulated provisions has helped reduce their burden on
financial intermediation and improve banks’ balance sheets. The restructuring program of the
two public specialized banks is near completion and the two institutions have significantly
improved their financial performance and are expected to comply fully with prudential
requirements by June 2007, as originally planned. A draft law on money laundering has been
submitted to parliament and is expected to be adopted soon. To help assess recent progress in
strengthening the financial sector and draw a roadmap for future reforms, the authorities have
requested the Fund and the Bank to conduct a new FSAP in mid-2007.
The authorities agree with staff on the importance of efficient financial intermediation for
achieving their growth objectives. BAM has launched a number of initiatives, in close
consultation with the banking sector, aimed at improving access to credit for small- and
medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), including through greater transparency and information
sharing and by encouraging development of rating systems. It is the authorities’ firm
intention to continue to monitor the situation closely, keeping in mind the need to secure
conditions for efficient intermediation in a competitive and market-based environment while
preserving the soundness of the financial system. A survey of bank conditions will be
conducted on a regular basis. Recent declines in lending rates and fees to levels more in line
with current liquidity conditions attest to improved competition and bode well for a
sustainable decline in banking spreads. The Treasury is also reviewing existing guarantee
schemes in favor of SMEs in order to improve their effectiveness. Recent successful IPOs
launched by a number of private corporations in the domestic stock market attest to increased
competition in financial services.
A higher growth trajectory is crucial for a significant and durable improvement in the
standards of living and further reducing unemployment and poverty. Cognizant of the major
contribution of past reforms to the recent positive performance, the authorities are firmly
committed to stay the course and to accelerate the reform process where necessary. In this
regard, they will continue to give highest priority to improving the business climate by
reducing red tape and streamlining administrative procedures, enhancing the rule of law and
protecting property rights, and improving governance. While progress in this area has been
noteworthy, as recognized in the 2007 World Bank Doing Business Report, there is no room

4
for complacency and the task ahead remains challenging. Similar attention is given to
upgrading and developing human resources and infrastructure, with significant private sector
involvement. Major infrastructure projects underway such as Tanger-Med (an integrated port
and economic development zone in the North) and tourism development zones, are expected
to be completed by 2008 and should have significant economic and social positive
externalities. To allow the Moroccan economy to reap the full benefits of the free-trade
agreements with the EU and the US, new agreements have been concluded with regional
partners so as to mobilize complementarities, while unilateral cuts in MFN (nonpreferential)
tariffs should contribute to reducing the risk of trade diversion. The authorities consider that
the Maghreb region provides important opportunities for enhanced trade and investment
flows that could significantly improve the growth performance in member countries and they
are grateful to the Managing Director for his involvement in and support to recent initiatives
aimed at improving economic cooperation within the region.
The key sources of growth have been identified, and agreements between the authorities and
business representatives have been concluded in tourism (Plan Azur) and industry (Plan
Emergence), announcing medium-term investment and outcomes targets, identifying the
needed reforms, and establishing appropriate mechanisms for limited government support,
mainly in the areas of access to land and vocational training. This cooperative approach,
which has been successful so far, should be extended to cover other sectors with high growth
potential, including the IT. Liberalization of the air transport sector, including an Open Sky
agreement with the EU, has significantly contributed to the recent surge in tourism.
Improving social conditions and further reducing poverty and social disparities are among
the highest priorities. The target of 100,000 social housing units per year has been exceeded,
contributing to a significant alleviation of the housing deficit and to a high level of activity in
construction; also many of the MDGs are likely to be achieved ahead of schedule. The
National Initiative for Human Development launched by H.M. King Mohammed VI has been
instrumental in defining the poverty alleviation and social strategy and galvanizing moral and
financial support for its implementation.
The authorities are confident that, with continued sound macroeconomic policy and structural
reforms and maintenance of social consensus, together with further progress in political and
social reform, the large potential of the Moroccan economy could be better mobilized to the
benefit of its entire population. They are comforted by the recent improved economic
performance and the growing signs of confidence within the business community and the
public at large. They will strive to preserve and consolidate recent gains in order to achieve a
higher and more sustainable growth path.
