IMF Executive Board Concludes 2015 Article IV Consultation with Bangladesh

On January 20, 2016, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded
the 2015 Article IV consultation with Bangladesh.1
Despite global headwinds and episodes of domestic unrest, Bangladesh has had a strong
macroeconomic performance in the two years since the last Article IV consultation, supported by
prudent policies under the recently-completed Extended Credit Facility (ECF) arrangement with
the IMF.
Real GDP growth has remained above 6 percent, a notable performance in the current global
context. Headline inflation has eased, international reserves have risen further, and the public
debt-to-GDP ratio has remained largely stable at a moderate level. However, tax revenue
performance has been weak, with revenues increasing more slowly than GDP. Also, private
domestic demand, particularly private investment, has been subdued, partly contributing to a
slowdown in credit to the private sector. Various economic activity indicators suggest a slowerthan-expected start to the current fiscal year (FY16, July 2015–June 2016).
Provided calm prevails, prudent policies remain in place, and structural reforms are implemented
as envisaged, the medium-term economic outlook should be positive and marked by continued
stability and high growth. In FY16, real GDP growth is projected at 6.3 percent, supported by
higher public sector wages and public investment. Growth is projected to accelerate gradually to
7 percent over the medium term, as public investment is further ramped up and constraints on
investment ease, with private investment also supporting a recovery in private sector credit.
Headline inflation is forecast to remain broadly stable in FY16 and edge up slightly next fiscal
year owing to temporary effects from higher public sector wages and the introduction of the new
VAT. Against investment-led growth, the current account balance is projected to remain in a

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with members, usually
every year. In the presence of an IMF arrangement, such as the Extended Credit Facility arrangement that
Bangladesh had with the IMF between April 2012 and October 2015, Article IV consultations take place every two
years. As part of the consultation, a staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial information, and
discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On return to headquarters, the staff
prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the Executive Board.

moderate deficit, averaging 1.5 percent of GDP, while international reserves should continue to
rise.
Executive Board Assessment2
Executive Directors commended the Bangladesh authorities for the strong macroeconomic
performance over the past few years, including under the recently completed Extended Credit
Facility arrangement. Growth has been robust, external reserves have risen, inflation has abated,
the public debt-to-GDP ratio has remained stable at a moderate level, and social indicators have
improved. Directors noted that the outlook is broadly positive, provided the authorities continue
to implement prudent policies and structural reforms to create fiscal space for development
needs, strengthen the banking system, enhance resilience against shocks, including from climate
change, and promote diversification and inclusion.
With inflation risks tilted to the upside, Directors recommended continued vigilance and prudent
adjustment of reserve money growth. They also encouraged the authorities to continue sterilized
foreign exchange intervention and to consider adopting a basket of trading partners’ currencies to
guide foreign exchange intervention policy going forward.
Directors agreed that mobilizing domestic revenue should be a foremost policy priority to create
fiscal space for increasing public investment in critical infrastructure and strengthening social
safety nets, while keeping the debt-to-GDP ratio broadly stable. To achieve these goals,
Directors called for timely implementation of the new VAT supported by an effective
communication strategy. They also emphasized the importance of continued efforts to strengthen
tax administration, particularly through automation, and reforms to expand income tax bases.
Directors stressed the need to improve budget formulation and execution, and to strengthen the
selection of public investment projects by subjecting them to strict cost-benefit analysis,
particularly projects financed by nonconcessional external borrowing. They also encouraged the
authorities to improve public financial reporting and management at state-owned enterprises, and
to move toward a market-based fuel price regime.
To boost private sector credit, and thereby further promote investment and growth, Directors
called on the authorities to press ahead with reforms to strengthen banking sector supervision,
and avoid regulatory forbearance. They also encouraged continued progress in improving
corporate governance, credit policies and asset quality at state-owned banks, and aligning the
national savings certificates interest rates with market rates.

At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the Board, summarizes the views of
Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the country's authorities. An explanation of any qualifiers
used in summings up can be found here: http://www.imf.org/external/np/sec/misc/qualifiers.htm.

Directors commended the authorities’ efforts to promote financial inclusion. They called for
wide-ranging reforms to improve public infrastructure and the investment climate, and to
diversify exports. Directors welcomed the priority that the authorities are giving to adapting to
climate change, and looked forward to sustained efforts in this area, including through improved
coordination and oversight of climate change-related spending.

STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2015 ARTICLE IV CONSULTATION
January 5, 2016

KEY ISSUES
Context. Since the last Article IV Consultation in November 2013, macroeconomic
stability has been maintained, supported by prudent policies under the recentlyconcluded Extended Credit Facility arrangement. However, private domestic demand
and credit growth have been tepid, and export growth has slowed, as it has in other
Asian countries. The real effective exchange rate has appreciated strongly, but the
external position is broadly in line with fundamentals and desirable policies.
Outlook and risks. Provided that political calm prevails, public investment is ramped up,
and constraints on private investment are eased, growth is projected to accelerate
gradually to 7 percent over the medium term. Lingering political uncertainty, low fiscal
revenues, and weaknesses in state banks’ balance sheets are the main challenges to the
medium-term outlook.
Policies. The policy priorities are to:


Safeguard stability by anchoring fiscal policy on a broadly stable public debt-toGDP ratio and monetary policy on continued prudent reserve money growth;
building resilience in the financial sector by enhancing regulation and supervision
and strengthening state-owned banks; and developing a medium-term fiscal
framework for climate change adaptation.



Boost private investment, including through better public infrastructure, an easier
investment climate, and a more supportive financial system.



Strengthen inclusion, by improving the progressivity of public spending and the tax
system, and furthering financial inclusion.



Create fiscal space for growth-enhancing and inclusive spending, by mobilizing
domestic revenue, particularly through the implementation of the new VAT; further
reducing regressive energy subsidies; and strengthening public financial
management.

CONTEXT
1.
The Bangladesh economy has undergone a major transformation in the past two
decades (Figure 1). GDP growth has been strong and largely stable since the mid-1990s (average:
5.8 percent), allowing real per capita income to double over the period. The shares of manufacturing
and services in GDP rose, spearheaded by the emergence of the garment industry. Poverty has
declined steadily, while inequality has remained broadly stable. In addition, Bangladesh has made
major strides on social indicators, and compares favorably to other low-income countries (Figure 2).
2.
In the two years since the last Article IV consultation, prudent policies have
underpinned a generally strong macroeconomic performance (Figure 3), supported by the
recently-completed Extended Credit Facility (ECF) arrangement with the IMF (Appendix I). Real GDP
growth has been robust; headline inflation has eased; international reserves have risen further; and
the public debt-to-GDP ratio has remained stable at a moderate level. However, tax revenues have
underperformed, and economic activity has been tepid more recently.
3.
Political calm has returned, but tensions remain. Disputes between the main political
parties, particularly over the legitimacy of the January 2014 general elections and the conviction of
key opposition leaders by an ongoing war crimes tribunal, have led to episodes of violence over the
past two years. Widespread violence has subsided since the elections, except for a brief resurgence
in early 2015. However, underlying tensions remain, leading to lingering uncertainty.

MACROECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS
4.
Against global headwinds and episodes of domestic unrest, domestic demand and
activity have weakened. The share of private consumption in GDP has steadily declined since fiscal
year 2011 (FY11, July 2010–June 2011), while private investment has remained largely unchanged as
a share of GDP since FY12 after steadily increasing since the mid-1990s (though it is still higher than
for the median low-income country). Moreover,

5.
Several factors may have weighed on private investment and growth (although the
absence of adequate and timely data, particularly on private sector balance sheets, prevents a full
quantification):
Crippling regulations and continued bottlenecks in critical infrastructure, particularly in energy
and transport, which may have become more binding in recent years as the economy
modernizes and becomes more market-oriented. These constraints stem in part from low
public investment and inadequate

6.
Financial sector weaknesses also hamper credit, investment, and growth (macrofinancial linkages flow chart below, and Figures 4–6). Bangladesh does better than other low-income
countries in a broad measure of financial development.2 However, asset quality, profitability and
capital adequacy have declined in the banking sector since end-2012, particularly in state-owned
banks (SBs), beset by poor governance and scams. Weak bank balance sheets and governance issues
reduce lending capacity, take credit away from productive investment, and, in the case of SBs, can
lead to fiscal recapitalization costs (Box 2 and paragraph 23). High levels of non-performing loans
and the high rates on national savings certificates (NSCs, a government deposit-like financing
instrument), increase banks’ operating and funding costs, putting upward pressure on interest rates

(see Selected Issues Papers, Chapter I).3 Rising (albeit still small) corporate borrowing from abroad
has also reduced reliance on domestic credit. Finally, the 2010–12 stock market crash (which
anecdotal evidence indicates was accompanied by a real estate price decline) had some impact on
private demand. It also hit the banks, which were significantly exposed to the stock market,
potentially affecting credit.

7.
Slower bank credit to the public and private sectors has contributed to high liquidity
in the banking system (Figure 7). As a result, inter-bank (call) interest rates have fallen steeply,
much more than deposit and lending rates. Also, slower credit has led to weaker broad money
growth.

The rates on NSCs were cut by 1½ – 2 percentage points in May 2015, but the wedge vs. bank deposit rates has
widened again since.

8.
Headline inflation has eased, but nonfood inflation is up. On the back of a good rice
harvest in 2014 and declining global prices, food price inflation decelerated, helping headline
inflation ease from 7.4 percent (y/y) in December 2013 to 6 percent (y/y) in November 2015.
However, nonfood inflation has picked up by nearly 2 percentage points during this period to
6.6 percent (y/y). Against general signs of tepid demand, this uptick likely reflects one-off factors,
including higher minimum wages in the garment industry and recent electricity and gas tariff hikes.
Despite lower global oil prices, domestic retail fuel prices have not been reduced.
9.
Tax collections significantly underperformed in the past two years. Subdued activity
and imports have contributed, but are not the only factors: revenues have grown more slowly than
output. Thus, already one of the lowest in the world, the tax-to-GDP ratio fell in FY14 and FY15,
pointing to persistent weaknesses in tax policy and administration. Moreover, nontax revenues
declined significantly in FY15, in part due to lower profit transfers from public sector agencies to the
government. While current expenditures remained restrained, helped in part by lower fuel subsidies,
and the capital budget was under-executed, this was not sufficient to offset weak revenue
performance. As a result, the fiscal deficit (excluding grants) is estimated to have risen to 4.2 percent
of GDP in FY15 (FY14: 3.5 percent of GDP).4
10.
The external position is broadly consistent with fundamentals and desirable policies
(Box 1 and Figure 8). After two years of surpluses, the current account balance (CAB) swung into a
moderate deficit (0.8 percent of GDP) in FY15 on account of subdued exports, though the CAB
returned to a surplus in the first quarter of FY16 as

There are, however, important structural weaknesses in the external sector. In
particular, exports remain concentrated in garments, and foreign direct investment (FDI) inflows
remain much lower, as a share of GDP, than in most low-income countries (Box 1), mainly due to the
constraints on investment highlighted above.

Box 1. Bangladesh: External Sector Assessment
The external position is broadly consistent with fundamentals and desirable policies. External sector
policies should seek to improve the investment climate to attract larger FDI inflows and diversify export
supply.

Foreign asset and liability position
Background: Bangladesh had a net international investment position (NIIP) of -11 percent of GDP
in 2014 (2013: -13 percent of GDP), consisting of foreign assets of 16 percent of GDP and foreign
liabilities equivalent to 27 percent of GDP. About 80 percent of all assets are accounted for by
Bangladesh Bank (BB)’s gross international reserves and over half of all liabilities stem from public
sector debt obligations. The commercial banking system’s net foreign asset position is positive.
Assessment: The structure of the external balance sheet, dominated by low-risk liquid assets and
public sector liabilities, implies low vulnerabilities.

Current account
Background: The current account swung from a
surplus of 1.2 percent of GDP in 2013 to a deficit
of 0.1 percent of GDP in 2014, mainly on
subdued exports. The deficit is projected to
widen to 0.9 percent of GDP in 2015.

Capital and financial accounts
Background: The capital and financial accounts have registered strong surpluses in recent years,
reaching 2½ percent of GDP in 2014. Capital inflows are dominated by official development
assistance and medium-term loans to the public sector. Inflows to the private sector (particularly FDI
and portfolio investments) have been small (around 1 percent of GDP) and largely offset by private
sector outflows.
Assessment: The capital and financial accounts are relatively stable. Vulnerabilities are limited by the
highly concessional nature of inflows as well as high reserve buffers.

OUTLOOK AND RISKS
12.
Staff projects real GDP growth at 6.3 percent in FY16, supported by higher public sector
wages and public investment. This is slightly lower than in staff’s previous projections, reflecting
weaker economic indicators in the first few months of FY16 (paragraph 4).5
13.
The medium-term outlook is positive, provided that policies remain prudent, tax
revenues are strengthened, and calm prevails:


Growth is projected to accelerate to 7 percent by FY20 on the back of: (i) a ramp-up in
public investment, which assumes tax revenues will be boosted by the launch of the new
value added tax (VAT) in July 2016; and (ii) a recovery in private investment, as regulatory
and infrastructure bottlenecks are eased and the financial sector strengthens. Despite the
recent REER appreciation, Bangladesh retains a sizeable labor cost advantage (expected to
be supported in the future by very favorable demographics), which should make it an
attractive source country as competing producers move up the value chain. Beyond FY20,
once the demand-side impact from increased investment subsides, growth is expected to
converge back to a potential rate of about 6.5 percent.



Inflation is expected to edge up in FY16–18 on account of higher public sector wages and a
one-off effect from the introduction of the new VAT. Headline inflation should fall gradually
toward 6 percent by FY20 assuming monetary policy remains prudent and supply
bottlenecks are eased.



Private sector credit growth is expected
to average around 15½ percent over the
medium term, with its share in GDP
increasing by 2 percentage points to
40 percent by FY20. This is consistent
with the envisaged investment and GDP
growth paths, and also with pre-creditboom trends (prior to FY06) and crosscountry patterns of financial deepening.

1/ Fiscal year begins July 1.

14.
Political and financial-fiscal shocks are the main risks to the outlook (Box 2). A
resumption of political violence or heightened uncertainty would adversely impact investment,
growth, and inflation. Continued weakness in the banking sector, in particular at the SBs, could
undermine credit and growth prospects and affect fiscal sustainability, as would a failure to launch
the new VAT (see the Debt Sustainability Analysis, DSA). On the external side, a protracted slowdown
in the European Union (Bangladesh’s main export destination) could hurt exports. Implementation
of the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP), of which Bangladesh is not a member, could also erode the
competitiveness of exports to TPP member countries (which account for around one-fourth of
Bangladesh’s exports) , though the impact is likely to be mitigated by Bangladesh’s significant cost
and scale advantages.6 Moreover, the outlook for remittances (a major driver of consumption) is
uncertain: while worker outflows have recovered, persistent low oil prices could eventually affect
investment and employment in key host countries. From a broader perspective, natural disasters and
global climate change pose major risks for Bangladesh (paragraph 24). Linkages with large emerging
market economies and international financial markets remain limited, cushioning against potential
shocks from these sources.

6
The main impact is likely to be on garment exports to the United States (20 percent of Bangladesh’s garment
exports), on account of increased competition from Vietnam. Bangladesh’s garment exports to the US are currently
subject to a 15.6 percent tariff; Vietnam’s are subject to an 8.4 percent duty, which will go down to zero after full
implementation of TPP. However, Bangladesh has a much higher population than Vietnam (156 million compared to
90 million) and more favorable demographics (Vietnam’s workforce is estimated to have peaked in 2015, whereas
Bangladesh’s is projected to peak in 2030). Bangladesh also maintains duty-free access to the European Union (61
percent of garment exports and 55 percent of total exports), where it has been steadily gaining market share for
several years.

Credit shocks are the main risk for the banking system.7 Poor lending decisions are a
major concern in the SBs and some private banks. Main credit exposures are to services sectors and
to large single borrowers (exposures to households and real estate are small). While banks’ direct
currency risks are low, rising external borrowing by corporations poses an indirect risk.

Authorities’ views
16.
Outlook. The authorities agreed on the drivers of FY16 growth, but viewed staff’s
projections as conservative. They believed that, amid slow external demand and domestic
investment, growth would likely be lower than the official forecast of 7 percent, but should still be in
the 6.5–6.8 percent range. They also forecast FY16 inflation at 6.2 percent, slightly lower than staff’s,
while Bangladesh Bank’s FY16 BOP projections are broadly similar to staff’s. Over the medium term,
under the Seventh Five Year Plan (FY16–20), the authorities expected growth to reach 8 percent,
backed by prudent policies and higher investment. They agreed with staff that the impact of TPP
implementation on Bangladesh’s exports would likely be limited given Bangladesh’s significant cost
and scale advantages, supported by favorable demographics.
17.
Risks. The authorities believed that political violence is highly unlikely and does not pose a
risk to the outlook. On tax collections, the authorities noted that revenues had continued to grow in
nominal terms and stressed their efforts to boost collections. They agreed with staff’s external sector
assessment.

POLICY DISCUSSIONS
Discussions focused on policies to safeguard macroeconomic stability; enhance resilience against
shocks, including from climate change; mobilize domestic revenues for development; and promote
diversification and inclusion.

A. Safeguarding stability and strengthening resilience
18.
Macroeconomic policies. With GDP growth broadly stable, the focus of aggregate
macroeconomic policies in the near-term should be to safeguard stability. However, in the event
7

that the economy is hit by large temporary shocks, counter-cyclical policy responses would be called
for in the form of fiscal easing (including through automatic stabilizers and increased transfers to
the poor) and the use of reserve buffers. If the shocks are protracted, the exchange rate should be
allowed to depreciate and fiscal policy adjusted to keep it broadly in line with the fiscal anchor
(Box 2).
19.
Fiscal policy stance and debt sustainability. The overall fiscal deficit (excluding grants) is
expected to widen to 4.7 percent of GDP in FY16, as a public sector pay hike, the first in six years, is
implemented. Over the medium term, staff projects the increase in pay (1 percent of GDP) and in
public investment (2 percent of GDP) to be partly offset by lower energy-related subsidies and
higher revenue from the new VAT. The debt-to-GDP ratio would remain broadly stable as a share of
GDP, which is a reasonable anchor for medium-term fiscal policy: while public debt is moderate, its
trajectory is highly vulnerable to revenue shocks given the low revenue base and high debt service
burden (see DSA). Over the longer term, the debt-to-GDP ratio is projected to increase slightly and
then stabilize as concessional external financing declines and interest costs consequently rise, and as
pension liabilities increase with aging. Throughout the projection horizon, debt remains sustainable
on the key assumption that the new VAT is implemented as planned (see DSA).
20.
Deficit financing. The authorities should reconsider the need to use NSCs as a financing
vehicle: they compete with bank deposits, potentially leading to disintermediation, set an artificial
floor on bank rates, and reduce fiscal space for critical spending. If NSCs are kept, their rates should
be systematically aligned with market rates. Over the medium term, domestic financing of the fiscal
deficit should be gradually reduced given the high exposure of banks to the sovereign and the
potential crowding out of private investment. Forced subscription of treasuries by banks
(“devolvement”), seldom used recently amid high liquidity in the banking system, should be
eliminated. Instead, there is scope to switch to more external financing for the given fiscal deficit, in
light of the relatively low level of external debt, strong reserve position, and manageable currency
risks (see DSA).

Monetary policy stance. With upside risks to nonfood inflation from higher public wages,
reserve money growth in FY16 should remain at about the current pace. Over the medium term,
bringing reserve money growth below the baseline projection, while protecting private sector credit

by shifting deficit financing to more external sources, would help inflation ease faster than projected
(Figure 9). Looser policy, on the other hand, could stoke inflation and stock prices, risking instability.8
22.
Exchange rate policy. With the REER having appreciated considerably in recent years and
amid uncertainty about the impact this may have on export competitiveness, continued sterilized FX
intervention is warranted in the near term. By undermining competitiveness, further significant REER
appreciation could eventually impact growth, tax revenue, and bank asset quality. The authorities
should monitor FX market developments and export performance, and adjust intervention policy as
needed. They should also consider using a basket of trading partners’ currencies as a benchmark for
FX intervention, instead of implicitly pegging to the U.S. dollar. Given the importance of the euro
area as an export market, this would provide a better reference for monetary and exchange rate
policy.

Financial sector policies. To boost financial sector resilience, policy priorities include:


Enhancing financial sector regulation and supervision, by strictly enforcing existing rules and
avoiding regulatory forbearance; and completing implementation of risk-based supervision,
contingency planning, and lender of last resort policies. Loan rescheduling and restructuring
policies should be revised to reflect the costs of such adjustments on bank balance sheets.
The authorities should consider the adoption of a coherent macro-prudential framework to
mitigate risks and shore up financial sector resilience. Loan-to-value ratio limits exist for
home and auto loans, but the authorities are also exploring the use of other instruments,
such as counter-cyclical capital buffers. Debt-to-income ratio caps could also be adopted.



Addressing risks from concentration and macro-fiscal linkages. In particular, reduce banks’
exposure to: (i) the sovereign (and reform the NSCs; paragraph 20); (ii) the capital market, in
line with the limit set in the law by the July 2016 deadline; and (iii) large single borrowers. In
addition to generating risks, these exposures potentially deviate credit from productive
investment.



Strengthening the SBs, advancing the three-pillar agenda adopted during the ECF
arrangement: (i) improving governance (particularly by appointing independent, accountable
boards and enhancing internal control and compliance, under strict BB oversight);
(ii) shoring up SB balance sheets through recapitalization, improved loan recovery, and
temporary credit growth limits;9 and (iii) completion of branch automation by 2016, to
strengthen financial reporting and efficiency.



Improving the legal and financial framework for loan recovery. Difficulties in realizing
collateral and lengthy dispute resolution processes have weakened banks’ ability to bring

Paper, 15/231.

Starting in June 2015, as part of the phased implementation of Basel III capital adequacy standards, BB excluded
from regulatory capital past due loans, which were earlier recorded as “intangible assets” on the balance sheets of
state-owned commercial banks. This is a welcome step that will more accurately reflect SBs’ capital positions.

down non-performing loans. The authorities should consider promoting simpler court
procedures, alternative dispute resolution procedures, and asset management companies.
24.
Addressing long-term vulnerabilities: climate change. Bangladesh is one of the world’s
most vulnerable countries to the impact of climate change, particularly in the form of flooding from
rising sea levels and tropical cyclones, with potentially devastating effects on the most vulnerable
(see Selected Issues Papers, Chapter II). To build resilience in this area, the authorities should:


Identify, and cost, priority projects for adaptation, including protection against flooding.



Strengthen the fiscal framework for climate change, ensuring that spending plans are
adequately financed and reflected in the annual budget and medium-term fiscal plans.



Strengthen coordination of climate change initiatives by centralizing policymaking under
one agency and allowing all spending and financing to be reflected in the budget.



Contain greenhouse gas emissions, including through: (i) carbon taxation and further energy
subsidy reforms; and (ii) a review of natural gas pricing policies: the financial terms in
production sharing contracts (PSCs) are deemed unattractive by prospective investors,
discouraging exploration and production of this cleaner energy source. Also, low prices for
end users, while encouraging consumption, induce waste.

25.
Authorities’ views. The authorities broadly shared staff’s views. They did not support
eliminating NSCs, which they saw as providing a safety net to women and the elderly, but were open
to reviewing NSC rates regularly to reduce the gap with market rates. The authorities will consider
the costs and benefits of a shift to more external financing of the fiscal deficit over the medium
term. They broadly agreed with staff’s recommendations on exchange rate policy. On monetary
policy, BB was initially envisaging somewhat higher reserve money growth in FY16 than
recommended by staff, but intends to reassess reserve money targets in the next Monetary Policy
Statement. Furthermore, the authorities reiterated their commitment to reforming the SBs, and are
exploring options to improve loan recovery. The authorities concurred on the need for coordinated
action to adapt to the challenges from climate change, but viewed the financial terms for
exploration and production of natural gas as sufficiently attractive.

B. Promoting inclusive growth
26.
Boosting private investment and diversification. To sustain high growth rates against
weakening external demand, increase productivity, and allow Bangladesh to take full advantage of
its young population and low labor costs, private investment (including foreign) needs to increase
and exports should be diversified into new, higher value-added goods and services. This requires:


18

Better public infrastructure. Efforts should focus on increased public investment on highpriority and cost-effective projects in power and transport infrastructure and fostering
private participation through public-private partnerships (PPP), taking advantage of the PPP
Act passed in September 2015.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

BANGLADESH



Easier investment climate, including through continued liberalization of FX regulations, as
well as reforms to increase land availability, enhance transparency, and simplify tax and
customs procedures. Reviewing the financial terms for natural gas PSCs and allowing
international firms to bid for onshore gas wells would boost investment in the gas sector.



More supportive financial system. Continued improvements in financial regulation and
supervision, strengthening the SBs, containing bank financing of the fiscal deficit, and
aligning NSC rates with market rates should make more credit available to finance
productive investment.

27.
Strengthening inclusion. Poverty has declined and income inequality has remained
relatively low and stable over the last two decades. However, the poverty-reducing impact of growth
could be further raised by:


Improving the progressivity of public spending, by containing expenditure on regressive
universal subsidies and unfunded pension systems for civil servants, and increasing spending
on well-targeted social safety nets.



Improving the progressivity of the tax system, by implementing the new VAT with its
regressivity-reducing features, broadening income tax bases, and strengthening property
taxation.



Continuing to promote financial inclusion. Bangladesh has made steady progress in this area
(Box 3 and Selected Issues Papers, Chapter III). Successful schemes, such as those using
mobile phones for domestic remittances, or facilitating women’s access to finance, should be
expanded.

28.
Authorities’ views. The authorities shared staff’s assessment of subdued private investment
and highlighted the need for increased investment to attain the government’s growth targets under
the Seventh Five Year Plan. They broadly agreed with staff’s policy recommendations on inclusion,
and suggested bearing in mind the challenges posed by Bangladesh’s unique features, including
high population density.

Box 3. Financial Inclusion in Bangladesh: A Stocktaking
Policies. Bangladesh has adopted a number of policies to enhance access to and usage of financial
services by those who would otherwise be excluded from them, including promoting mobile financial
services, requiring banks to open at least fifty percent of their branches in rural areas, introducing agentbased banking, establishing floors on credit to agricultural and rural sectors backed by credit refinancing
lines on concessional terms, prioritizing support to small businesses and women, schemes aimed at
rehabilitating slum dwellers, and developing no frill accounts (including the 10 Taka accounts).

Cross-country analysis. Bangladesh compares favorably with other low-income developing countries
(LIDCs) on two key indicators of access to formal finance – accounts held at and credit from a financial
institution – across different population groups. However, the use of credit and debit cards is minimal,
and the prevalence of informal finance is still high.

Boosting tax revenue. Progress is needed on several fronts:


VAT implementation. The new VAT is the authorities’ main reform to expand revenue in
coming years. Initially scheduled to be completed in July 2015, the implementation process
suffered major setbacks and delays in 2014 as well as strong opposition from the business
community. However, progress has been made this year and the authorities are working
towards full implementation in July 2016.10 The timeline is tight, and will require focused,
concerted efforts. Priority actions requiring

while the rates for corporate and personal income taxes are in line with those of countries at
similar income levels, their bases should be broadened, and property taxation expanded.

Box 4. Bangladesh: World Bank’s 2015 Public Expenditure Review (PER) Update - Main Findings1
The PER Update finds that capital and social spending have increased recently, but project selection and
implementation is weak, infrastructure remains poor, and public services are limited, while the share of
interest costs is very high.


Total central government (CG) spending. Bangladesh has among the world’s lowest ratios of CG
expenditure to GDP (about 14 per cent). This results in very limited public services (for instance,
Bangladesh spends less on health care per capita–around US$95 in 2013–than most countries in the
world) and poor infrastructure (ranked 130th out of 144 countries in the Global Competitiveness
Report 2014–15), particularly for transport.



Remuneration has declined as a share of noninterest current expenditure (to 30 percent) in FY14. With
pay increases taking place every five years, allowances have tended to increase in intervening years.



Social spending. Current spending on education, health, and welfare has risen in real terms and as a
share of noninterest current expenditure over the past ten years, but remains low.



The sustainability of pension spending has been aided by an increase in the retirement age for
government employees (from 57 to 59 years of age). However, inflows to the unfunded General Provident
Fund, currently positive and used to finance the deficit, are expected to turn negative in the longer term.



Subsidies are sizeable (over 1 per cent of GDP for fertilizer and electricity in FY14) and not well targeted
or efficient.



Interest costs have almost doubled since FY11 and are very high, accounting for around one quarter of
current expenditure in FY14, similar to what is spent on education or on health and welfare. This has been
driven mainly by growth in domestic interest payments.



Reflecting its higher priority, development (capital) spending has grown faster than current spending on
average over FY10–14, and accounted for around 40 per cent of total CG spending in FY14. Transport,
communication, energy, health and education have received the largest shares of allocated spending
under the Annual Development Program (ADP), in line with the government’s development strategy.
However, delayed execution and cost over-runs of development projects are common, resulting in lower
returns to investment. Significant intra-year revisions to the ADP suggest poor planning and budget
practices. Fragmented institutional arrangements undermine project selection and implementation.



Spending on infrastructure maintenance, however, has been stagnant in real terms.

Review.



Administrative reforms. The focus should be on enhancing transparency, reducing discretion,
and simplifying compliance. Continued progress on automation is crucial to achieve these
goals.

31.
Improving spending allocation. Spending on infrastructure, infrastructure maintenance
(which has stagnated and could compromise the growth benefits of scaled-up public investment),
and social spending targeted to the poor should be raised. Despite policy measures to lower
inefficient and regressive energy subsidies, including the recent hike in electricity and gas prices,
subsidy costs remain significant. These should be gradually reduced, including by renegotiating
contracts with costly rental power plants and building new plants operated by cheaper fuels. In
addition, over the medium term domestic fuel prices should be aligned with international prices
through a formula mechanism. The authorities should also reform the civil servants’ unfunded
pension system to reduce future liabilities.
32.
Strengthen public financial management. Despite recent improvements, particularly in
public debt management, further progress is needed:


Budget planning, formulation, and execution need to be strengthened. Unrealistic revenue
assumptions and reliance on budget revisions make planning difficult and stretch resources.
Treasury cash flow forecasting should be further calibrated.



Nonconcessional external borrowing should be used strictly for growth-critical, cost-efficient
projects, following rigorous cost-benefit analysis.



Financial reporting in state-owned enterprises should be strengthened, particularly in
Bangladesh Petroleum Corporation (BPC), where the authorities should press ahead with an
external audit by a reputed global firm.

33.
Authorities’ views. The authorities reaffirmed their commitment to launching the new VAT
by July 2016. They also noted the progress so far in VAT implementation, and agreed on the need
for an effective communication strategy. The authorities welcomed staff’s views on improving the
budget formulation process, prioritization of government spending, and rigorous monitoring of
nonconcessional external borrowing. They agreed on the need for improving financial management
in BPC and mentioned that amendments to its charter are currently under consideration of
parliament, including one on allowing external audit by international firms. They preferred domestic
fuel price stability over an automatic adjustment formula.

OTHER ISSUES
34.
Safeguards recommendations. A number of safeguards recommendations remain
outstanding, including strengthening BB’s internal audit function and legal framework, and regularly
appointing globally-reputed firms to audit BB’s annual financial statements (see Informational
Annex). Two globally-affiliated local firms audited BB’s FY15 financial statements and issued
unqualified opinions.
24

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

BANGLADESH

35.
Exchange rate regime. The de jure exchange rate regime is a float. Effective February 2013,
the de facto regime was reclassified from “other managed” to a “stabilized arrangement”.
Bangladesh is an Article VIII member and maintains an unapproved exchange restriction on the
convertibility and transferability of proceeds of current international transactions in non-resident
taka accounts. Since the last Article IV consultation the authorities have relaxed the restriction by
allowing certain debits to balances in such accounts for outward remittances, but they do not have a
specific timetable for the complete removal of the restriction.

STAFF APPRAISAL
36.
Overview. Macroeconomic performance has been strong over the past two years,
underpinned by prudent policies. However, private domestic demand has weakened; nonfood
inflation has edged up; and tax collections have underperformed.
37.
Outlook and risks. Real GDP growth is expected to remain flat in FY16 but should
accelerate gradually over the medium term, backed by higher public and private investment,
provided that policies remain prudent, tax collections are strengthened, and calm prevails. Headline
inflation will likely go up in FY17 on higher wages and as the new VAT comes into effect, but is
expected to fall thereafter on prudent policies and eased supply bottlenecks. The current account
deficit should widen slightly as investment takes off.
38.
Macroeconomic policy stance. The overarching objective of near-term macroeconomic
policies should be to safeguard stability and strengthen resilience. However, there is room for a
counter-cyclical response to temporary growth shocks.
39.
Monetary policy. Given upside risks to nonfood inflation, reserve money growth in FY16
should be maintained around 13 percent. Over the medium term, bringing down reserve money
growth slightly would help inflation fall faster, while private sector credit would be protected by
shifting to greater external financing of the fiscal deficit.
40.
Exchange rate policy. The REER has steadily appreciated over the past three years, but is
broadly in line with fundamentals. While Bangladesh still maintains its labor cost advantage,
continued sterilized FX intervention is warranted in the near term. The authorities should also
consider using a basket of trading partners’ currencies as a benchmark for FX intervention, instead
of keeping a close link to the U.S. dollar.
41.
Fiscal policy. The fiscal deficit (excluding grants) is expected to widen in FY16 as a public
sector pay increase comes into effect. Over the medium term, fiscal policy should be anchored on
keeping the public debt-to-GDP ratio broadly stable around its current level. This will require an
increase in the tax revenue-to-GDP ratio as public pay and investment rise. To contain government’s
interest expenses, and also to reduce financial disintermediation, the authorities should discontinue
the NSCs or align their rates with market rates on a permanent basis. Over the medium term, a
moderate shift toward more external financing could be considered.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

25

BANGLADESH

42.
Mobilizing domestic revenue. Under current spending plans, full and timely
implementation of the new VAT is critical for fiscal sustainability. However, the timeline is tight and
requires focused, concerted efforts by all stakeholders. A well-designed communications strategy
will be essential to highlight the tax’s features and benefits. Moreover, the base for taxation should
be broadened, and property taxation expanded. Administrative reforms should be expedited.
43.
Improving spending allocation. Public expenditure should focus on improving growthcritical infrastructure and well-targeted social safety net programs. This should be complemented by
a reduction in regressive energy subsidies.
44.
Strengthening public financial management. Important priorities in this area are
improving budget formulation (including more realistic revenue forecasts) and execution; subjecting
nonconcessional external borrowing to rigorous cost-benefit analyses; and strengthening financial
management and reporting at state-owned enterprises, including through an external audit of BPC
by a globally-reputed firm.
45.
Promoting further inclusion. Improved spending allocation, combined with a more
progressive tax system and further gains in financial inclusion, should help boost growth and make
it more inclusive, allowing poverty to fall faster.
46.
Financial sector reforms. The authorities should continue to strengthen risk-based
supervision and avoid regulatory forbearance. Banks should comply with the legal limit on their
exposure to the stock market by the July 2016 deadline. Further progress is needed in improving
governance, capital position, and asset quality in SBs. Staff recommends developing a strong macroprudential framework and adopting reforms to facilitate loan recovery.
47.
Promoting private investment and diversification. Achieving higher growth will require
policies to boost private investment, including foreign direct investment, and to diversify exports to
higher value-added goods and services. These policies should be complemented by better public
infrastructure; an easier investment climate (including for gas exploration and production); and a
more supportive financial system.
48.
Adapting to climate change. To minimize the impact of climate change, the authorities
should identify top priority projects for adaptation; include their costs in the medium-term fiscal
framework; and improve coordination and oversight of climate change-related spending. The
authorities should also consider taxing carbon and reviewing the pricing of natural gas.
49.
Staff recommendations. Given the absence of a specific timetable for its removal, staff
does not recommend approval of the existing exchange restriction. It is recommended that the next
Article IV consultation with Bangladesh take place on the standard 12-month cycle.

introduction of stricter NPL accounting standards at the end

Most NPLs are long overdue and concentrated in a handful of
state-owned banks. By sector, industrial loans (including

State-owned commercial banks are Agrani Bank, Janata Bank, Rupali Bank, and Sonali Bank. BASIC Bank is included under specialized development banks.
2/ An adjustment is made to exclude special accounts set up in state-owned commercial banks' balance sheets, which contain the accumulated losses
arising from the difference in market and book value of assets. These amounts are deducted from state-owned commercial banks' assets and regulatory
capital. From June 2015, Bangladesh Bank started adjusting away these accumulated losses from banks' capital position, which staff was doing earlier. Additional
adjustments to capital is made by staff (based on information from Bangladesh Bank) for banks that availed themselves to the temporary relaxation
in loan rescheduling rules between December 2013 and June 2014.
3/ New loan classification and provisioning regulations became effective with the financial statement for end-December 2012.
4/ From December 2013 nonperforming loans are adjusted for the staff estimated impact (based on information from Bangladesh Bank) of temporary
relaxation in loan rescheduling rules.
5/ Bangladesh Bank defines return on equity (ROE) as the ratio of net income after provision and taxes to regulatory capital. Discrete jumps in ROE of
state-owned banks reflect a combination of movements in operating profits and capital positions.
6/ Bangladesh Bank defines return on assets (ROA) as the ratio of net income after provision and taxes to total assets.
7/ Gross income defined as operational income before provisions and taxes.

Appendix I. Bangladesh: Implementation of Policy Advice
since the 2013 Article IV Consultation
In the last two years policy discussions took place in the context of the Extended Credit Facility
(ECF) arrangement, approved in April 2012 and completed in October 2015. The arrangement,
put in place after external shocks and accommodative domestic policies in 2010–11 led to higher
inflation and international reserve losses, aimed to restore macroeconomic stability, shore up the
external position, create fiscal space to boost social and development-related spending
(including in power and transport infrastructure), strengthen the financial sector, and stimulate
investment.
Recommendations

Policy Actions

Macroeconomic policies
Monetary policy: Keep reserve money growth
restrained while providing room for a recovery in
private credit growth. Foreign exchange
interventions could be scaled back, given reserve
adequacy, but targets need to be achieved
through sterilized interventions.

Monetary policy has been prudent. The targets on net
international reserves (floor) and net domestic assets (ceiling)
of Bangladesh Bank (BB) were met comfortably, while the
reserve money target (ceiling) was met most of the time.

Fiscal policy: Allow for a moderate fiscal
consolidation and a continued gradual reduction
of the public debt-to-GDP ratio, by boosting tax
revenues while lowering subsidies to make room
for increased public investment and social
spending.

Fiscal policy has been generally prudent and restrained, but
marked by revenue underperformance. Under the program,
the target on bank financing of the fiscal deficit (ceiling) was
systematically met. Energy subsidies came down as a result of
domestic price hikes and a decision not to adjust domestic
fuel prices in the face of lower global oil prices. Also, social
spending was protected. However, capital spending as a
share of GDP has been largely unchanged since FY13 on
weak implementation capacity. Moreover, there have been
significant shortfalls in tax revenues relative to targets. As a
result, no significant public consolidation has occurred and
the public debt-to-GDP ratio remained largely flat between
FY13 and FY15.

Financial sector policies
Strengthen the state-owned commercial banks
(SOCBs). Improve the governance, credit risk
management, and balance sheets of the SOCBs.
Strict compliance with memoranda of
understanding (MOU) with BB should be
ensured; all branches should be automated
by 2016; and gradual recapitalization should take
place while replacing the bank boards with
competent directors after scrutiny by BB.

Bank boards have been reconstituted and partial
recapitalizations have taken place since December 2013.
Branch automation is making steady progress. However,
compliance with the MOUs has been mixed, and there has
been slow progress in reforming corporate governance and
internal control and compliance practices.

BANGLADESH
Recommendations

Policy Actions

Improve BB’s supervisory capacity and
enforcement, including through expanding riskbased supervision. Improve central bank
safeguards and appoint globally-reputed audit
firms to conduct external audit of BB’s accounts.

Using powers given to BB under the amended Banking
Companies Act (BCA), 2013, the central bank has taken
strong actions against bank malpractice or misbehavior. The
central bank has also appointed observers to the large
SOCBs. Risk-based supervision is being implemented along
with implementation of contingency planning and lender of
last resort policies. But there have been repeated instances of
regulatory forbearance on loan rescheduling and
restructuring. Internal audit and safeguards are being
improved at BB. A chartered accountant has been appointed
to the Audit Committee of BB Board and automation of BB’s
internal processes is ongoing. The authorities appointed a
globally-reputed firm to audit BB’s FY13 and FY14 accounts,
but appointed local firms (affiliated with global firms) to audit
FY15 accounts.

Limit banks’ exposure to stock market to
25 percent of capital.

The amended BCA allowed banks to bring down their
exposure to the capital market to 25 percent of eligible
capital by July 2016. Bangladesh Bank is currently monitoring
the progress on a bank-by-bank basis.

Structural reforms

46

Boost tax collections.

Tax collections fell as a share of GDP between FY13 and FY15
and the authorities missed most of the quarterly revenue
targets under the program. A new VAT (which staff estimates
will boost revenue by about 2 percentage points of GDP by
FY20) is being implemented, but the implementation process
has suffered delays and the launch, initially planned for
July 2015, has been postponed to July 2016. Administrative
reforms and modernization of the Direct Tax Code are
ongoing.

Strengthen public financial management.

External borrowing processes have been strengthened and
the limits on new nonconcessional external debts were
observed. However, there are still significant weaknesses in
budget formulation and implementation, and treasury cash
flow forecasting is still at a pilot stage. There has been little
progress in improving financial management and reporting
at Bangladesh Petroleum Corporation (BPC). A professional
financial analyst has been appointed in BPC, but little
progress has been made on conducting an external audit of
its accounts by a globally-reputed audit firm.

Ease foreign exchange (FX) regulations and
reporting requirements to facilitate investment.

The authorities have eased a large number of FX regulations
and reporting requirements. They also amended the Foreign
Exchange Regulations Act, approved in September 2015.

Boost inclusive growth.

The authorities have increased public investment in critical
infrastructure. They have also made progress in improving
labor and factory safety standards in the garment industry
and revised the minimum wages in that sector. Trade tariffs
are being gradually streamlined. The targeting and efficiency
of social safety net programs needs further attention.

Safeguards Assessment


A safeguards assessment of Bangladesh Bank (BB) was concluded in July 2011. Since then, BB
has implemented a number of recommendations, including approval for incorporation of the
Security Printing Corporation (Bangladesh) Limited, a subsidiary of BB, in the audit plan of BB’s
internal audit department (IAD); and approval of Reserve Management Guidelines by the BB
Board and monitoring of investment of foreign exchange reserves by a committee headed by a
Deputy Governor. A certified chartered accountant was appointed in March 2014 as an advisor
to the Audit Committee of the BB Board. After engaging a globally-reputed firm for two
consecutive years (FY13 and FY14), the authorities appointed local audit firms, affiliated with
global firms, to audit BB’s FY15 financial accounts. On all three occasions, BB received
unqualified audit reports. The authorities have also implemented most of the recommendations
made in the management letters for the FY13 and FY14 audits.



Going forward, staff recommended appointing a globally-reputed audit firm to conduct the
external audit of BB’s financial statements on an annual basis. To further strengthen BB’s internal
audit function, the authorities are working toward improving risk management in key
departments; developing risk rating reports; integrating different information technology
platforms; and reviewing their operational risks. Staff capacity in the IAD needs attention. The
safeguards assessment also recommended that the legal framework of the BB be strengthened.

Anti-Money Laundering (AML) and Combating the Financing of Terrorism (CFT)


Bangladesh has graduated from monitoring by the Financial Action Task Force of compliance
with AML/CFT processes and has become a member of the Egmont Group of Financial
Intelligence Units. The Asia Pacific Group assessed the country’s AML/CFT framework in October
2015 and will publish a report after its July 2016 plenary. A national strategy for AML/CFT for
2015-17 has been prepared and several MOUs have been signed with financial intelligence units
around the world.

Exchange Arrangement


Exchange regime. The de jure exchange rate regime is a float. Effective February 7, 2013, the de
facto regime was reclassified from other managed to a stabilized arrangement.



Exchange restriction. The Executive Board had urged the authorities to adopt a timetable to
remove the remaining exchange restriction on the convertibility and transferability of proceeds
of current international transactions in nonresident taka accounts. In September 2013, a strategy
paper laid out a roadmap toward gradual liberalization of exchange regulations. Since then, BB
has eased several foreign exchange regulations and reporting routines. These include easing of
restrictions on certain debits for current transactions purposes from the nonresident taka

IMF-WORLD BANK COLLABORATION
(December 2015)
1.
The IMF and World Bank Group (both International Development Association (IDA) and
International Finance Corporation (IFC) teams) work together to promote policies and critical
reforms that are essential for maintaining macroeconomic and financial stability and for sustained
high growth and poverty reduction in Bangladesh.


Over the last three years, the IMF’s priorities for macroeconomic policies and structural
reforms were anchored by the Extended Credit Facility (ECF) arrangement, approved in
April 2012 and completed in October 2015. With support from this arrangement, the
authorities restored macroeconomic stability and undertook reforms in the areas of
domestic revenue mobilization, notably enacting a new Value Added Tax Act in 2012; tax
revenue administration; fiscal expenditure allocation, including the reduction in regressive
energy subsidies and strengthening of social safety nets; public financial management,
including strengthening the external debt management; banking supervision and regulation,
including amending the Banking Companies Act in 2013; addressing weaknesses in the
state-owned commercial banks; improving central bank operations; and liberalizing foreign
exchange regulations. The priorities for macroeconomic policies and reforms going forward
are identified in the main text of this report.



The Bank’s strategy is reflected in the forthcoming Country Partnership Framework (CPF) for
FY16-20, to be delivered in 2016. The CPF, which is aligned with the Government’s Seventh
Five Year Plan, is anchored in the Bangladesh Systematic Country Diagnostic (SCD), which
was completed in 2015. The SCD identifies five transformational investments needed for
Bangladesh to create more and better jobs and to accelerate poverty reduction. These are in
the areas of energy; inland connectivity and logistics; regional and global integration;
urbanization; and adaptive delta management. In addition, the SCD identifies three
foundational priorities which represent important prerequisites for growth and where policy
attention must be sustained: macroeconomic stability; human development; and institutions
and business environment.

2.

The teams note that collaboration between the IMF and the World Bank Group is strong,
both at headquarters and in the field (through the IMF Resident Representative’s Office and
the World Bank’s Country Office). For instance:



There are frequent formal and informal exchanges of information on each other’s activities
and on assessments of developments, the outlook, and key policy issues.



The teams invite each other to participate in critical internal discussions, share key
documents, and seek comments on them.

6

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

BANGLADESH



Staffs are also invited to relevant Board meetings.



The teams regularly discuss the division of labor between the two institutions, and
collaborate on the Debt Sustainability Analysis (DSA).

3.
The teams agree that the two institutions should remain focused on the following reform
areas, and based on the following division of labor:


Tax policy and administration. Bangladesh has one of the lowest tax-to-GDP ratios in the
world. To boost growth, higher public investment in critical infrastructure is needed and for that
purpose it is necessary to improve revenue generation. Under the ECF arrangement, the
authorities enacted a new Value Added Tax (VAT) Act, 2012, which is now being implemented
for a launch in July 2016. The new VAT is currently the authorities’ main tool to boost tax
collections over the medium term. Efforts to boost the capacity of the National Board of
Revenue and modernize the Direct Tax Code are ongoing. Division of labor: The new VAT law
and the VAT implementation plan continue to receive technical assistance (TA) from the IMF. A
resident advisor was in place until late 2014 to help with VAT implementation. IDA will provide
financial support for several aspects of implementation, including designing organizational
reforms and new administrative processes, which are urgent priorities. Both institutions are
currently providing TA to the implementation process.



Public financial management (PFM). Sound PFM is important for maintaining fiscal discipline
and improving the quality of public expenditure. Division of labor: IDA has provided assistance
through its administration of the Strengthening Public Expenditure Management Program
(SPEMP), supported by a multi-donor trust fund. SPEMP focused on core PFM issues in the
executive branch of government, as well as strengthening public expenditure oversight functions
in parliament and audit institutions. IDA is also taking the lead on public procurement reform
and capacity building. The IMF is providing support through several TA missions on cash flow
forecasting and management, on budget and accounting classification, and on the budget
formulation process.



Debt management. There has been significant progress on strengthening debt management
practices under the ECF, but more needs to be done. Division of labor: The IMF and IDA will
continue working jointly in this area, including on the DSA, with the IMF coordinating views on
main macroeconomic assumptions and outlook and supporting structural reforms on debt
management through Article-IV consultations, and IDA providing technical support on debt
management capacity through the Public Expenditure and Revenue Analysis (PERA) work,
Analytical Support Activity on Public Financial Management (PFM) reforms as well as a Debt
Management Performance Assessment (DeMPA).



Monetary and exchange rate policies. The IMF takes the lead in this area. IDA will play a
complementary role through operations to strengthen payments systems at Bangladesh Bank
(BB).

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

BANGLADESH



Financial sector reforms. A sound and viable financial sector will remain critical for creating an
improved environment for private sector investment. The IMF has provided TA on banking
supervision, including through a resident advisor until late 2014, and on strengthening the stateowned commercial banks (SOCBs). The IMF will continue to support banking sector reforms
through the Article-IV consultations. IDA will provide support to improve the regulatory and
oversight capacity of BB and help strengthen the SOCBs through automation/improved
management systems and business process reengineering, including potential governance
reforms, and laying the foundation for a well-functioning insurance and pension sector.



Energy sector reform. Over the last three years, spending on subsidies, particularly on energy,
has come down as a share of GDP, initially through domestic price adjustments and more
recently with help from a decline in the international oil prices. Further price adjustments are
needed, including through adoption of systematic adjustments to domestic fuel prices in line
with international price movements. Reducing financial and operational inefficiencies in stateowned enterprises in the energy sector is also critical. Bangladesh ranks poorly among the lowincome countries in terms of availability of electricity. Finally, going forward, power generation
should rely less on expensive liquid fuel. Proper incentives are needed for stepped-up private
investment in the energy sector. Institutionalization of transparent and competitive procurement
processes will send the right signal to the market and help attract qualified sponsors. Division of
labor: IDA will lead on policy dialogue and investment in this area, with the IMF focused on
policies to address fiscal implications.



Social protection. Under the ECF arrangement social spending as a share of GDP was
protected. However, further improvement is needed, particularly through improved targeting,
and consolidation of a large number of programs. Rationalization of regressive fuel subsidies will
also help provide additional room for enhanced spending on social safety programs. Division of
labor: IDA is taking the lead in this area through support to the development of the National
Household Database to be used for objective beneficiary selection and for improved
management and administration of SSNs.



Trade and investment climate reform. To boost productivity and investment, it is vital to
create a level playing field for all sectors and reduce the cost of doing business. Division of labor:
IDA has the leadership of a Diagnostic Trade Integration Study that has been completed, and IFC
is targeting incremental reforms with the aim of improving legal and administrative procedures.
Trade & Competitiveness global practice, a joint IDA-IFC unit, will address institutional and
policy reforms (including those addressed in the Diagnostic Trade Integration Study) to boost
trade and sectoral competitiveness and will provide IDA financing for development of special
economic zones. The IMF provided support in reviewing the foreign exchange regulations.



Statistical policy. Improvements in statistics are critical to formulating sound policies and
monitoring their outcomes. Both IDA and the IMF have sustained engagement in this area and
will ramp it up further in the future as needed. Division of labor: IDA on poverty, social,
development statistics, and statistical infrastructure including IT needs and the IMF on
macroeconomic and financial statistics.



Other structural policies. The World Bank keeps the IMF informed about its work on
governance and anti-corruption, local government and decentralization, and private sector
development. Upstream sharing allows the IMF to comment on such work before it is finalized.

4.
The teams agree to continue to keep each other informed of their respective activities,
coordinate financial and technical support, and share key documents.

RELATIONS WITH THE ASIAN DEVELOPMENT BANK1
(December 2015)
Lending and Technical Assistance Operations
5. Bangladesh had cumulative public sector borrowing from the Asian Development Bank
(AsDB) of US$16.1 billion (248 loans) as of December 31, 2014, and technical assistance (TA)
grants of US$240.6 million (409 projects). The country is one of the largest borrowers of
concessional Asian Development Fund (ADF) resources. The loans and TA have supported all
key sectors, including energy and transport, social infrastructure, and agriculture and natural
resources. The AsDB has also supported eleven private sector projects worth
US$372.3 million, including the Bibiyana II Gas Power Project which involves design,
engineering, construction, and operation of a 341 megawatt (MW) combined-cycle, gasfired power plant—and PRAN Agribusiness Project which supports development of new
agribusiness production facilities by PRAN, the largest food and agribusiness group in
Bangladesh.
6. In 2014, the AsDB approved a total amount of US$1.09 billion in loans. This included loans
for (i) Skills for Employment Investment Program (Tranche 1) (US$100 million ADF); (ii)
Coastal Towns Environmental Infrastructure Project (US$52 million ADF); (iii) Irrigation
Management Improvement Project (US$46 million ADF); (iv) Flood and Riverbank Erosion
Risk Management Investment Program- Project 1 (US$65 million ADF); (v) South Asia
Subregional Economic Cooperation Railway Connectivity: Akhaura-Laksam Double Track
(US$505 million, of which US$105 million is from ADF); and (vi) Third Urban Governance and
Infrastructure Improvement Project (Sector) (US$125 million ADF).
Country Partnership Strategy
7. The Country Partnership Strategy (CPS) 2011–15, approved on October 27, 2011, focuses on
six sectors: energy, transport, urban development, education, agriculture and natural
resources, and finance. The CPS is closely aligned with the government’s Sixth Five-Year Plan
priorities and aims to contribute to more inclusive and greener growth. Under the CPS, the
total indicative resources for public sector lending during 2011–15 included US$2.4 billion in
ADF and US$2.1 billion in Ordinary Capital Resources (OCR). AsDB’s OCR financing would be
used for major revenue-generating infrastructure projects. An average of US$9.6 million per
annum in TA resources was included, of which 35 percent would be allocated for project
design.
8. The CPS prioritizes the thematic drivers of environmental sustainability and climate
resilience, regional cooperation, knowledge solutions, partnerships, good governance and

capacity development, gender equity, and private sector development. Country Operations
Business Plan (2016–18), under the current CPS, was approved in October 2015.
9. Over a five-year cumulative period from 2010–14, Bangladesh leveraged US$4.4 billion of
co-financing. By the end of 2014, cumulative direct value-added official cofinancing for
Bangladesh amounted to US$5.54 billion for 52 investment projects and US$79.0 million for
94 technical assistance projects. In 2014, five projects received cofinancing: (i) from European
Investment Bank for South Asia Subregional Economic Cooperation Railway Connectivity:
Akhaura-Laksam Double Track (US$175 million); (ii) from the OPEC Fund for Third Urban
Governance and Infrastructure Improvement Project (Sector) (US$40 million); (iii) from Swiss
Development Cooperation for Skills for Employment Investment Program (Tranche 1)
(US$10 million); (iv) from the Government of Netherlands for Flood and Riverbank Erosion
Risk Management Investment Program- Project 1 (US$15.3 million); and (v) from the
Sanitation Financing Partnership Trust Fund under the Water Financing Partnership Facility,
and the Strategic Climate Fund for Coastal Towns Environmental Infrastructure
(US$42 million).
Economic and Sector Work Program
10. Each year, the AsDB publishes its Asian Development Outlook and Asian Development
Outlook Update, in which it assesses macroeconomic performance. The AsDB’s Bangladesh
resident mission also publishes the Bangladesh Quarterly Economic Update. A bimonthly
Economic Indicators Update is also prepared. BRM also commissions studies on economic
and thematic areas, relevant to the country’s development issues.

STATISTICAL ISSUES
(December 2015)
Assessment of Data Adequacy for Surveillance
General. Data provision has some shortcomings, but is broadly adequate for surveillance. The most
affected areas are national accounts, fiscal, and external sector statistics.
National Accounts. Bangladesh’s annual GDP time series has a base year of 2005/06 based on a
comprehensive benchmark compiled and published by the Bangladesh Bureau of Statistics (BBS)
in 2013. There is a material statistical discrepancy in subsequent time periods as minimal source data
is available – estimates are predominately derived from a biennial census of manufacturing
establishments or extrapolations from the 2005/06 benchmark. The BBS has been provided with
technical assistance to use value-added tax (VAT) data from the National Board of Revenue (NBR) to
compile contemporary estimates and construct a contemporary statistical business register to
increase the scope and coverage of economic statistics. The BBS is also implementing
recommendations provided by the resident advisor to: (a) improve compilation procedures used to
construct GDP; and (b) enhance institutional arrangements and address concerns raised by users.
Quarterly GDP is currently not compiled.
Price Statistics. A new CPI series with base year 2005/06 was introduced in July 2012 and improved
coverage. The CPI series is currently undergoing further improvements, including incorporating the
recent household survey and Classification of Individual Consumption According to Purpose
(COICOP). The IMF provided technical assistance (TA) in these areas. The producer price index has an
outdated base year (1988/89) and requires urgent attention.
Government Finance Statistics. The Ministry of Finance (MoF) is currently revising the Budget and
Accounting Classification System (BACS) to follow the latest international standard (GFSM 2014) and
integrate the accounting and reporting systems for the budgetary central government. The new
BACS is expected to be incorporated into the FY18 Budget. The coverage of units outside central
government is inadequate and is an area for future attention. No data are published on the assets
and liabilities of the general government.
Monetary and Financial Statistics. Bangladesh Bank (BB) compiles monetary data using the
standardized report forms (SRFs) framework. The SRFs are reported electronically to the IMF on a
regular basis. As a result, a consistent time series based on SRF data is available from
December 2001. A survey of Other Financial Corporations (OFCs) is not yet available.
Financial Soundness Indicators. Bangladesh has started reporting 10 core and 9 encouraged
Financial Soundness Indicators (FSIs) since August 2014.

12

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

BANGLADESH

External Sector Statistics. A quarterly BPM6 compliant time series covering the period 2005
to 2014 inclusive has been published by BB and reflects improved coverage of goods and trade
credits made during recent years. Nonetheless, inconsistencies between the Balance of Payments
(BOP), International Investment Position (IIP), and other macroeconomic statistics remain and should
be continuously addressed. Published IIP estimates remain weak.
Data Standards and Quality
Bangladesh has participated in the General Data Dissemination System (GDDS) since March 2001.
The Data Module of the ROSC was published in December 2005.

STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2015 ARTICLE IV CONSULTATION—DEBT
SUSTAINABILITY ANALYSIS UPDATE
Approved By
Markus Rodlauer and Catherine Anne Maria
Pattillo (IMF) and Satu Kahkonen (IDA)

Prepared by
International Monetary Fund
International Development Association

This debt sustainability analysis (DSA) updates the joint IMF/IDA full DSA from October 5, 2015.1
The results indicate that Bangladesh remains at a low risk of external public debt distress. Total
public debt is also on a sustainable path assuming that the new value added tax (VAT) comes
into effect in full. 2 In the absence of a permanent boost to revenues, the public debt trajectory
would become unsustainable.

A. Background
This Debt Sustainability Analysis (DSA) update presents staffs’ macroeconomic outlook
and assumptions about the public sector’s external and domestic borrowing paths. The
DSA incorporates the authorities’ estimates of the stock of public external and domestic debt
and private external debt as of end-FY15 (fiscal year 2015, July 2014-June 2015) and analyzes
the likely trajectories of standard debt sustainability (solvency and liquidity) ratios through
FY36.
As of end-FY15, total public sector and public sector-guaranteed external nominal debt
amounted to US$26 billion (13 percent of GDP or 77 percent of exports of goods and
services). The World Bank and the Asian Development Bank are—by far—the two largest

1

Based on the end-June 2014 stock of debt, the last full DSA was prepared in October 2015 (IMF Country
Report No. 15/304). In line with the Staff Guidance Note on the Application of the Joint Bank-Fund Debt
Sustainability Framework for Low-Income Countries (SM/13/292, IDA/SEC/82566), a full DSA is expected to be
prepared once every three years for PRGT-eligible, IDA-only countries. In between short updates are expected
to be produced unless macroeconomic conditions since the last full DSA have significantly changed.
2

For the purposes of this DSA, the public sector comprises the central government and nonfinancial public
enterprises. This analysis is based on the joint Fund-Bank debt sustainability framework for conducting debt
sustainability analysis in low-income countries. Under IDA’s Country Policy and Institutional Assessment (CPIA),
Bangladesh is assessed to be a medium performer, with an average rating of 3.31 during 2012–14. This DSA
update uses the indicative thresholds for countries for this category.

Sources: Bangladesh authorities; and IMF staff estimates.

Total public sector domestic debt as of end-FY15 amounted to 20 percent of GDP
(or 208 percent of central government revenues, including grants). Domestic debt
comprises mostly commercial banks’ holdings of treasury instruments and non-banks’
holdings of national savings certificates.3 It also includes net credit by Bangladesh Bank
and the outstanding liabilities of state-owned enterprises to the banking system (text
table).

High exposure of commercial banks to the central government remains a concern (see Box 1 in IMF Country
Report No. 14/149 for a discussion). Development of an active secondary market and a funded pension system
could help weaken the bank-sovereign link.

B. Underlying Assumptions
The main changes to the macroeconomic assumptions relative to the full DSA in October 2015
are described below, primarily reflecting the impact of revisions to FY16 projections (based on
data outturns for the first three months of FY16):


Growth in FY16 and FY17 has been marked down by 0.2 percentage points of GDP.



Average annual export and import growth in FY16-FY20 has been marked down by 0.7
and 0.3 percentage points respectively.



The real bilateral taka-dollar exchange rate is assumed to appreciate by 3 percent in FY16
instead of remaining constant.

C. External DSA
Under the baseline scenario, Bangladesh’s public and publicly guaranteed (PPG) external debt
to GDP ratio is projected to increase from 13 percent of GDP in FY15 to 15 percent in FY21,
mostly reflecting higher externally-financed public investment. It is projected to peak at
approximately 17 percent in the late 2020s before trending down to 15 percent of GDP by
FY36. All associated PPG indicators also trend up initially (reflecting the on-take of new debt at
a declining grant element), but remain well within the respective policy-dependent solvency
thresholds under the baseline scenario and all associated stress tests (Figure 1 and Tables 2–3).
The stress tests with the larger impact on debt indicators are those involving a large nominal
depreciation or borrowing on less favorable terms.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

3

BANGLADESH

D. Public DSA
The present value (PV) of public debt to GDP ratio is projected to increase from 29½ per cent
in FY15 to 34 per cent in FY21 as the impact of higher public investment on debt is mostly
offset by an expected increase in tax revenue from the new VAT. The public debt-to-GDP ratio
rises slightly further in the long term, reflecting a gradual increase in real interest rates as the
concessionality of debt is assumed to decline steadily. By FY36 the debt-to-GDP ratio will be
about 41 percent of GDP as compared with 35 percent of GDP in FY15. As in the case of the
external DSA, all associated total PPG debt indicators remain well within the benchmark value
under the baseline and for all standard stress tests (Figure 2 and Tables 4-5). Debt indicators
drift upwards if primary deficits (as a share of GDP) remain fixed over the entire forecast period
at their projected peak in FY16, highlighting the critical importance, as public investment is
scaled up, of the assumed improvement in tax revenue from implementation of the VAT. The
stress test with the larger impact on public debt indicators is the one involving materialization
of contingent liabilities, following which debt indicators increase over the medium term but
then stabilize.

E. Alternative Scenario
An alternative scenario considers the consequences of failing to introduce the new VAT. In that
case, the tax revenue to GDP ratio would be lower by about 2 percentage points relative to the
baseline. With no consolidation in expenditure assumed, the fiscal deficit would widen, leading
to higher domestic borrowing costs.4 As a result, there would be a significant deterioration in
all standard public debt sustainability indicators, and the debt trajectory would become clearly
unsustainable (Figure 4). This implies that in the absence of a boost to tax revenues through
the introduction of the new VAT, to keep public debt on a sustainable path, a significant cut in
public expenditure would eventually be needed with knock-on effects on economic growth
and poverty reduction.

F. Conclusion
The macroeconomic framework is broadly unchanged from the last full DSA. The debt
sustainability assessment remains unchanged and the risk of external and public debt distress
continues to be classified as low. However, in the absence of a permanent boost to revenues,
including for instance from a failure to implement the VAT, and with no fiscal consolidation,
there would be a significant deterioration in all standard debt sustainability indicators, and the
debt trajectory would become unsustainable. The authorities agreed with the main conclusions
of this DSA Update.

4

The alternative scenario assumes the same future profile for public investment and external financing as the
baseline, and that domestic financing is used to meet the revenue shortfall from the failure to implement the
new VAT.

Includes both public and private sector external debt. Data on a fiscal year basis; e.g., 2015 corresponds to July 2014-June 2015.
Derived as [r - g - ρ(1+g)]/(1+g+ρ+gρ) times previous period debt ratio, with r = nominal interest rate; g = real GDP growth rate, and ρ = growth rate of GDP deflator in U.S. dollar terms.
Includes exceptional financing (i.e., changes in arrears and debt relief); changes in gross foreign assets; and valuation adjustments. For projections also includes contribution from price and exchange rate changes.
Assumes that PV of private sector debt is equivalent to its face value.
Current-year interest payments divided by previous period debt stock.
Historical averages and standard deviations are generally derived over the past 10 years, subject to data availability.
Defined as grants, concessional loans, and debt relief.
Grant-equivalent financing includes grants provided directly to the government and through new borrowing (difference between the face value and the PV of new debt).

2/ Variables include real GDP growth, growth of GDP deflator (in U.S. dollar terms), non-interest current account in percent of GDP, and non-debt creating flows.
3/ Assumes that the interest rate on new borrowing is by 2 percentage points higher than in the baseline., while grace and maturity periods are the same as in the baseline.
4/ Exports values are assumed to remain permanently at the lower level, but the current account as a share of GDP is assumed to return to its baseline level after the shock
an offsetting adjustment in import levels).
5/ Includes official and private transfers and FDI.
6/ Depreciation is defined as percentage decline in dollar/local currency rate, such that it never exceeds 100 percent.
7/ Applies to all stress scenarios except for A2 (less favorable financing) in which the terms on all new financing are as specified in footnote 2.

1/ Central government gross debt including debt owed to the IMF, plus domestic bank borrowing by the nonfinancial public sector and external borrowing by public enterprises that is supported by central government guarantees, including short-term oil
related suppliers' credits. The years in the table refer to fiscal years. For example, 2015 refers to July 2014-June 2015.
2/ Gross financing need is defined as the primary deficit plus debt service plus the stock of short-term debt at the end of the last period.
3/ Revenues excluding grants.
4/ Debt service is defined as the sum of interest and amortization of medium and long-term debt.
5/ Historical averages and standard deviations are generally derived over the past 10 years, subject to data availability.

Statement by Mr. Subir Vithal Gokarn, Executive Director and
Mr. Indu Shekhar Chaturvedi, Senior Advisor to the Executive Director
January 20, 2016
1.
The year 2015 was particularly good for Bangladesh’s engagement with the Fund.
It saw the first ever successful culmination of a Fund supported program in the country.
Our authorities look forward to continuing this deep engagement, especially through
Fund technical assistance.
2.
The staff report on the 2015 Article IV consultation for Bangladesh comes only
three months after the report on the combined fifth and sixth reviews under the Extended
Credit Facility (ECF) arrangement for the country. We had noted at the time of Board
consideration of the combined fifth and sixth reviews that the economy had shown good
performance during about three and half years of the ECF arrangement, with the only
exception being the area of revenue mobilization. We had also stated that Bangladesh had
an impressive record of growth and development over the last decade. The government of
Bangladesh is committed on building on these achievements in the time to come.
3.
Our authorities are in broad agreement with staff’s assessment and
recommendations in the 2015 Article IV consultation report, though there are some areas
of difference.
4.
As noted in the report, growth has been strong since the mid-1990s leading to a
doubling of per capita income. The authorities are confident that this strong performance
will continue over the medium term. They view staff’s projection of FY16 growth at 6.3
percent as a slight under-assessment. They are also confident of achieving medium
growth higher than staff’s projection of about 7 percent. Achieving these targets would
require an increase in both public and private investment. Public spending on
infrastructure projects is expected to increase substantially over the next five years. The
authorities will also take measures in several areas to enable private investment to go up.
5.
While the authorities broadly agree with staff’s assessment of risks to the outlook,
they do not see the likelihood of economic activity in the country getting disrupted by
political violence. They also believe that the impact of political unrest on economic
activity has been somewhat overstated in the past. In fact, the incidents of political
violence have remained contained over the last several months.
6.
The authorities recognize the urgent need for increasing government revenues,
and raising the tax-to-GDP ratio from its current low level. Their commitment to
implement the new VAT has been steadfast, despite difficulties on the way. A number of
measures have been taken in preparation for launching the new VAT on July 1, 2016.
The new VAT familiarization program, under the VAT Online Project (VOP), has
reached about 130000 VAT payers and several thousand VAT officers. The registration

module is under preparation and is expected to be launched in early April 2016. The
return submission module, to be launched subsequently, is also under preparation. Draft
rules have been prepared and orders laying down the transition strategy and prescribing
the exempt items are expected to be notified soon.
7.
Staff’s recommendations on direct tax reforms, strengthening tax administration,
improving the budget formulation process, prioritization of spending and rigorous
monitoring of non-concessional external borrowing have been carefully noted and efforts
will be made for graded improvements in these areas. The authorities have also taken
note of the concerns staff has expressed about the use of NSCs for financing government
expenditure. They do not view NSCs simply as a means to borrow, but also as a means to
support the underprivileged and disadvantageous sections of society. Therefore, they do
not consider the elimination of NSCs advisable. The NSC rates were reduced by up to 2
percentage points in May 2015 to reduce the gap with market rates. The authorities also
point out that devolvement has not been resorted to in the last two years.
8.
Our authorities recognize the possible adverse impacts of further REER
appreciation and will carefully monitor developments in this regard. Bangladesh
continues to enjoy significant cost advantage vis-à-vis other countries in garment exports
and the authorities are confident of an improved export performance going forward.
9.
In our Buff statement at the time of Board consideration in October 2015 of the
combined fifth and sixth reviews under the ECF arrangement, we had mentioned that the
authorities were committed to enhancing banking supervision and taking strict action in
cases of financial misconduct in banks. We had also mentioned that Basel III would be
implemented by 2019. Reform of the state-owned banks continues to be a priority for the
government. These banks are being recapitalized in a phased manner. The progress in
automation of their branches in 2015 has been encouraging. The compliance of stateowned banks with their MOUs with Bangladesh bank is being closely monitored.
10.
To boost private investment and potential growth over the medium term and make
the growth processes more inclusive, Bangladesh needs wide-ranging structural reforms.
These include reducing the deficit in public infrastructure and improving the businessclimate. The PPP Act passed in September 2015 should enable private participation in
public infrastructure projects, particularly in the power and transport sectors. The
authorities have noted staff’s recommendations for enhancing private investment and
diversification and will take action to ease the business and investment climate.
Bangladesh’s record in financial inclusion compares favorably with peers. However the
authorities recognize that more needs to be done and will continue making efforts for
greater financial inclusion. As mentioned in our October Buff statement, the
government’s oil subsidy bill has reduced, electricity and gas prices were raised a few
months back, and labor safety standards are being improved.

11.
Our authorities are fully cognizant of the fact that dealing with the impact of
climate challenge poses a serious challenge for Bangladesh. Staff’s Selected Issues paper
acknowledges the early action that Bangladesh has taken to be able to meet this
challenge. A comprehensive institutional architecture, including the Bangladesh Climate
Change Strategy and Action Plan (BCCSAP) of 2009, Climate Change Trust Act of
2010, BCCTF and BCCRF, has been put in place for concerted efforts in this area. In
addition, several routine programs focus on measures to tackle the challenge. The
authorities also recognize that it is necessary to significantly add to the steps that have
already been taken, particularly for ensuring the availability of the required funds and
building institutional capacity in managing climate change related projects. Staff’s
recommendations will be kept in view as further progress is made in this area.
