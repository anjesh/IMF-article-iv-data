IMF Executive Board Concludes 2016 Article IV Consultation with Portugal
On September 16, 2016, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF)
concluded the Article IV Consultation1 and Fourth Post-Program Monitoring2 with Portugal.
The economic recovery in Portugal is losing momentum. The slowdown in economic activity
that began in the second half of 2015 has persisted, despite still-favorable cyclical tailwinds and
supportive macroeconomic policy settings. The fiscal loosening in place since last year and the
ECB’s appropriately supportive monetary policy stance have translated into robust consumption
growth. However, overall GDP growth is being held back by weaker export growth and sluggish
investment, with the latter being weighed down by uncertainty, high levels of corporate debt, and
still-pronounced structural bottlenecks. Accordingly, output is expected to increase by only 1.0
percent in 2016.
Executive Board Assessment3
The Executive Directors welcomed that Portugal has achieved a major economic turnaround
since the onset of the sovereign debt crisis, as market access has been restored, fiscal and current
account balances have improved, and unemployment, though still high, has fallen substantially.
Directors noted, however, that notwithstanding the progress, the recovery is moderating and risks
are tilted to the downside. The slowdown in economic activity, together with banking sector
vulnerabilities and high public debt, poses challenges. Directors welcomed the authorities’
commitment to address these weaknesses and emphasized that a concerted policy effort,
including decisive fiscal adjustment, improvement in banks’ governance, and implementation of
key structural reforms, will be critical to strengthening Portugal’s macroeconomic position.

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with members, usually every year. A
staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial information, and discusses with officials the country's economic
developments and policies. On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the
Executive Board.
2

The central objective of PPM is to provide for closer monitoring of the policies of members that have substantial Fund credit
outstanding following the expiration of their arrangements. Under PPM, members undertake more frequent formal consultation
with the Fund than is the case under surveillance, with a particular focus on macroeconomic and structural policies that have a
bearing on external viability.

At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the Board, summarizes the views of Executive
Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the country's authorities. An explanation of any qualifiers used in summings up can
be found here: http://www.imf.org/external/np/sec/misc/qualifiers.htm.

2
While noting that sovereign financing conditions are subject to global developments, Directors
welcomed the staff’s assessment that risks to Portugal’s capacity to repay the Fund remain
manageable. In view of the authorities’ intention to repay the Fund early, they underscored the
importance of maintaining adequate cash buffers.
Directors considered the 2016 budget deficit target, 2.2 percent of GDP, to be appropriately
ambitious, yet noted the difficulties in achieving this target given declining GDP growth and
emerging expenditure pressures. They encouraged the authorities to pursue a well-specified
adjustment path, focused largely on expenditure, that balances the need to put debt on a firmly
downward trajectory while supporting growth. Directors called for a comprehensive spending
review, aiming particularly at better means-testing of social benefits and controlling pensions
and public sector wages. They also highlighted that tax policy should be more stable and
predictable and designed to boost competitiveness and growth.
Directors emphasized that addressing banking sector vulnerabilities should be a top priority.
They agreed that to return to profitability and successfully finance economic growth, banks
should clean up their balance sheets, including through the tackling of nonperforming loans,
supported by an increase in capital and provisions. Directors noted that banks should also reduce
operating costs and improve their internal governance to let lending decisions be guided solely
by commercial criteria. They also saw merit in finding national-level solutions to the challenges
facing Portuguese banks, using the existing regulatory toolkit.
Directors emphasized that pushing ahead with structural reforms remains critical to enhancing
competitiveness and promoting growth. They encouraged the authorities to fully implement the
already-enacted reforms in labor and product markets, with a particular focus on streamlining the
functioning of the public sector and limiting energy costs. To support implementation of these
reforms, Directors encouraged the authorities to engage all stakeholders by means of an inclusive
social dialogue.
Directors welcomed the ex post evaluation of exceptional access under the 2011–14 Extended
Fund Facility. The program was a qualified success, given that it helped stabilize the Portuguese
economy, but concerns about debt levels remain. Directors generally agreed that the pace of
fiscal adjustment had been appropriate; that treating banks as going concerns had been justified
in the absence of a banking crisis; and that sovereign debt restructuring had not been a realistic
option during the program. Directors pointed to the need for realistic projections and targets,
noting in this respect the limits to protecting growth in the face of necessary adjustment. Looking
forward, Directors emphasized in particular: the need to develop program modalities and a
toolkit for effective adjustment through internal devaluation; the importance of strong
forward-looking banking supervision and a proactive approach to private sector deleveraging;
the need to handle effectively legal constraints in program design; and the key role of country
ownership in all branches of government to enable and sustain reforms.

3
Directors recognized the determinative role of EU support in Portugal’s recovery and current
stability. For the effective design of future Fund programs with members of currency unions,
most Directors considered that high priority should be put on clarifying options for union-level
conditionality, and for instruments to ensure that member countries’ program goals can be met in
the face of asymmetric shocks not easily resolved by union-wide monetary policy.

STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2016 ARTICLE IV CONSULTATION
AND FOURTH POST-PROGRAM MONITORING
DISCUSSIONS

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
Portugal has achieved a major economic turnaround since the onset of the
sovereign debt crisis. Access to financing was restored following the large fiscal
adjustment, the external current account position has moved from a large deficit into
surpluses, while the unemployment rate—though still at high levels—declined sharply.
The fiscal targets for 2016 and 2017 are appropriately ambitious, but achieving them
will require tackling significant implementation challenges.
More recently, however, the economic recovery in Portugal has been losing
momentum. The slowdown in economic activity that began in the second half of 2015
has persisted, despite still-favorable cyclical tailwinds and accommodative fiscal and
monetary policies. The fiscal loosening in place since last year and the ECB’s supportive
monetary policy stance have translated into robust consumption growth. However,
overall GDP growth is being held back by weaker export growth and sluggish
investment, with the latter being weighed down by uncertainty, high levels of
corporate debt, and persistent structural bottlenecks.
The weaker economic environment, high corporate debt, and the banking
system’s related challenges from high non-performing loans (NPLs) are mutually
reinforcing. As banks continue to struggle with a large stock of NPLs, low profitability,
and high operating costs, they are unable to reduce corporate indebtedness and
provide adequate lending for investment. Weaker growth in turn, together with low
interest rates and low inflation, makes it more difficult for banks to rein in their stock of
NPLs and improve profitability.
A concerted policy effort is needed to address the interrelated weaknesses in the
banking system, public sector finances, and the macroeconomic outlook. A
credible and realistic fiscal adjustment path — going well beyond achieving a 3
percent headline deficit — is needed to ensure the medium-term sustainability of
public finances. This would alleviate significant uncertainty about the direction and
scope of future policies and support private sector investment plans. Structural reforms
to promote growth and competitiveness, and efforts to improve banks’ governance,
would boost this positive dynamic. Lower uncertainty and improved growth prospects
would in turn help support a strengthening of bank balance sheets, reduce potential
fiscal costs of supporting banks, and facilitate the required fiscal consolidation.

ECONOMIC CONTEXT
1.
Portugal’s economic recovery began to lose steam in the middle of 2015 despite a
generally supportive macroeconomic environment. Historically low yields, notwithstanding
occasional bouts of volatility, have afforded the public and household sectors relatively easy access
to finance, and facilitated an expansionary fiscal stance since 20151. Growth and employment have,
however, underperformed, as robust private consumption has been offset by weakening investment
and exports. By the first quarter of 2016, real GDP decelerated to 0.9 percent year-on-year (down
from 1.7 percent in 2015Q1), and the unemployment rate inched upward to 12.4 percent.

The ongoing recovery has largely been consumption-driven. Household consumption
has grown by 10 percent between 2013Q1 and 2016Q1, even though disposable income has only
increased by 4 percent over that period. This growth in consumption has been facilitated by an
unprecedented decline in the savings rate, attributable to the post-crisis boost to confidence and

the wealth effect from recovering house prices, in an environment of low interest rates. The ECB’s
Asset Purchase Program (APP),2 together with the expanded refinancing operations, has helped
improve access to financing for banks, but transmission to new corporate lending and investment
has been constrained by the high level of NPLs and the need for corporate deleveraging (see SIP).3
3.
Despite the lingering output gap, inflation in Portugal remains above the euro area
average. The continued price pressures from the nontradable sector, together with the fact that
most of Portugal’s trade is within the euro area, implied only a modest decline in Portugal’s real
exchange rate in 2015 notwithstanding the large nominal depreciation of the euro (Figure 5).

The fiscal stance remains expansionary. In 2015, the headline deficit of 4.4 percent of

fiscal loosening of 0.5 percent.4 The 2016 budget targets a fiscal deficit of 2.2 percent of GDP and an

The APP was announced in September 2014 and launched in October 2014 in an effort to provide further monetary
accommodation in the context of prolonged low inflation. This was initially limited to asset-backed securities and
covered bonds, but was subsequently expanded to also include public sector securities under the PSPP, as well as
corporate sector non-financial bonds under the CSPP.

The impact on bank lending appears to have been primarily on household credit, where NPLs are relatively modest,
with corporate lending continuing to contract. On corporate deleveraging, see IMF Country Report 15/126.

implied primary structural tightening of 0.1 percent. Staff projects a deficit of 3.0 percent, however,
on the basis of more conservative macroeconomic and fiscal projections. This is consistent with a
further 0.5 percent of GDP loosening in the fiscal stance.

5.
The current account posted a surplus in 2015 for the third year in a row, but some
weaknesses are emerging. Improving relative labor costs and likely some learning-by-doing for
firms have fostered a robust expansion of
exports as a share of total output. The

2015 were to a large extent supported by
favorable commodity prices. Foreign direct
investment inflows turned negative for the first time in many years in 2015, as inward investment
increasingly took the form of debt instruments (see Annex II for the External Stability Report).
6.
Against this economic backdrop, the banking system continues to suffer from weak
profitability and rising NPLs (Figure 1). Prior to the crisis, banks had managed to remain
profitable by intermediating large capital inflows—even with lower interest rate spreads and lower
margins since the adoption of the euro—and by some efforts at reducing operating costs. The
sovereign debt crisis and the ensuing

Sector Purchase Program (PSPP) purchases have been equivalent to a large share of the
government’s gross financing needs and helped minimize volatility. Nevertheless, yields have
diverged distinctly from those for Spain and Italy since last October and remain elevated, suggesting
that markets are pricing in some Portugal-specific considerations.

The banking system faces vulnerabilities from weak asset quality, thin capital buffers,
and low profitability. The banking system has required a series of taxpayer-financed interventions
over the years, including most recently at the end of 2015 for Banif. Recapitalization needs of the
largest bank Caixa Geral de Depósitos (CGD) and possible losses from the sale of Novo Banco may

necessitate further injections of public money, consistent with the application of EU state aid rules
and the Bank Recovery and Resolution Directive (BRRD).6 In addition, financial markets’ view of
publicly traded banks has deteriorated, as reflected in rising CDS spreads. Furthermore, with a large
fraction of banks’ loan book tied up in financially weak and unproductive enterprises, banks are not
in a position to spur economic growth by financing the investment needs of newly-created highproductivity firms.
10.
Portugal’s external position remains weaker than implied by medium-term
fundamentals and desirable policy settings. The EBA estimates are mixed but have deteriorated
since the last Article IV consultation. The real effective exchange rate measures indicate moderate to
substantial overvaluation in 2015, even though the current-account measures suggest the external
position is broadly in balance relative to medium-term fundamentals. Though somewhat lower than
in 2014, the net international investment position remains highly elevated at around 106 percent of
projected 2016 GDP. While the ES approach compares the current account balance with the balance
required to stabilize external debt, a larger surplus is needed to put external liabilities on a path to
more sustainable levels. Similarly, favorable oil price developments have masked the effect of rising
consumption-based imports, which are projected to turn the current account into deficit over the
forecast horizon.

Risks to the outlook are on the downside. The recent economic deceleration together
with the all-time low savings rate suggest that the consumption-driven recovery may run out of
steam in the near future. Additional recapitalization needs in the banking sector also cannot be
ruled out. Moreover, the 2016 budgetary targets are unlikely to be achieved without additional
measures. With an investment-grade rating—necessary for Portugal’s participation in PSPP—
provided by only one of the four rating agencies, the country is exposed to a low-probability but
high-impact risk of a ratings downgrade. More broadly, Portugal remains dependent on external
financing and exposed to financial turbulence arising from global risks including the aftermath of
the U.K. referendum and lower-than-anticipated growth in Europe (see Annex III).

12.
The currently comfortable access to market financing is being supported by the ECB’s
monetary policy stance. Sovereign yields have been contained due to market perceptions that the
ECB’s PSPP will be extended beyond the current end date. In view of this, the macroeconomic policy
framework needs to be strengthened to ensure durable access to financing once the monetary
policy stance normalizes, even if the latter is a sufficiently distant prospect.
13.
Even as QE provides a cushion, Portugal faces a multiplicity of self-reinforcing
vulnerabilities. There are three major areas of weakness: the banking system (facing a high level of
NPLs), public sector finances, and the macroeconomic outlook. Problems arising in any single area
could impact all others, potentially leading to a spiraling effect (see Figure 2).
14.
Any development that worsens the dynamics of public debt could trigger a sudden
change in market sentiment. It could be fiscal slippages resulting from either policy reversals or a
macro shock, or materialization of large contingent liabilities, including from the banking system. A
sharp rise in borrowing costs would further worsen debt dynamics and could force a large fiscal
adjustment, aggravating the impact on growth. In addition, an increase in yields would lower the
value of banks’ holdings of sovereign debt and weaken their capital position. Even if the fiscal
consequences of higher yields were to materialize slowly due to the high average debt maturity,
persistently high yields could dampen the general macroeconomic outlook and the prospects for
the banking sector.
15.
A negative reassessment of the country’s macroeconomic prospects could similarly
lead to a negative spiral. A poor macroeconomic outlook (due to, for instance, a global economic
slowdown or an abrupt normalization of the domestic saving rate that is not offset by higher
investment) would worsen the dynamics of public and private debt and negatively affect the fiscal
outlook. Already-indebted corporations and households would struggle to pay their debts, further
undermining banks’ asset quality, while the government would find it difficult to access financing at
favorable rates.
16.
Even in the absence of an immediate challenge, failure to address the abovementioned weaknesses could put Portugal on an unsustainable medium-term trajectory and
leave it vulnerable to shocks. Without meaningful policy action, Portugal will be unable to adjust
to the constraints of the monetary union or exploit the benefits of integration fully. Low growth,
unreformed fiscal spending, and weak banks will preclude much-needed (and still possible)
convergence and could lead to a loss of market access even under small shocks.

Authorities’ views
17.
The authorities acknowledge the risks to the outlook emanating from the recent
growth weakness. The authorities attribute some of that weakness to one-off factors—such as the
economic contraction in Angola, work stoppages at the major oil refinery, and change in the output
mix at a large automobile assembly plant—that will ease in the second half of the year. As a result,
the Banco de Portugal has lowered its projection for growth to 1.3 percent in 2016, with a slight
rebound to about 1.5 percent in the medium term. The Ministry of Finance maintains an unchanged
baseline outlook—growth of 1.8 percent in 2016 and rising to about 2 percent in the medium
term7—but acknowledged that the downside risks have become more pronounced.8
18.
The authorities appreciate the challenges facing the country but remain confident that
the policies in place are adequate to address them. The National Reform Program outlines an

For additional discussion of the authorities’ baseline outlook, see IMF Country Report 16/97.

The Ministry of Finance’s forecast implies a quarter-on-quarter growth of 0.8 percent for the remainder of 2016, a very
high rate by historical standards. Staff projects the quarter-on-quarter growth of 0.3 percent on average, in line with the
average quarter-on-quarter growth rate during this recovery (2013Q1 – 2016Q1) and still above the most recent average
growth (0.2 percent during 2015Q3 – 2016Q1).

appropriate way forward on the structural front; the weaknesses in banks should be addressed at
the European level; and the envisaged fiscal path strikes a right balance between the demands of
fiscal sustainability and the need to support domestic consumption and investment.

POLICY DISCUSSIONS
A.

Financial Sector

19.
Concerns over two large banks weigh on the outlook for the sector. Market participants
are wary of the significant capital needs of the country’s largest bank CGD (with publicly available
estimates approaching 3 percent of GDP), taking them as possibly indicative of larger NPL problems
in other banks as well. Another source of uncertainty is the size of losses other banks would sustain
if the ongoing bidding for Novo Banco—which received a €3.9 billion injection of public money (2.2
percent of GDP) that will eventually need to be recouped from the banks—were to disappoint. Bank
stocks have been under continuous downward pressure in recent months.
20.
Looking ahead, banks are expected to be squeezed by both weak supply and demand
for credit. On the supply side, the current balance sheet weaknesses and low expected profits (due
to the projected low real growth, inflation, and interest rates), together with a low likelihood of large
capital inflows will limit banks’ ability to grant credit. On the demand side, overleveraged
households and corporates are not in a position to accummulate more debt.

Addressing the challenges facing the banking system should be an urgent priority. A
comprehensive approach is needed for banks need to clean up their balance sheets.9 This should
include restructuring problem loans supported by an increase in banks’ capital buffers, provisions,
and impairments.10 This would also require appropriately pricing and selling poor quality legacy
assets and raising capital, albeit under challenging circumstances. Moreover, a governance structure
that more fully reflects the interests of the shareholders will make increasing profitability banks’
primary objective (see SIP). Banks need to diversify exposures—in particular by shifting their
attention from nontradable to tradable sectors—in order to better manage risks and to be wellpositioned to finance new engines of growth. Since banks’ interest income will be constrained by
the projected low-interest environment,11 and since banks already derive a relatively high proportion
of their income from fees, cutting costs is necessary to achieve higher profitability. This would likely
require further consolidation in the banking system, and cutting the extensive branch network and
staffing costs. Focused bank supervision—already enhanced to pay more attention to capital
weaknesses—will be an important driver of these policies.12 The European framework provides
flexibility to address specific issues currently under consideration (CGD and Novo Banco). Access to
bank-level data would permit a more granular assessment of challenges facing the banking system
than is currently feasible for staff. Broader issues facing the banking system are outlined in Box 1.

See IMF Staff Discussion Note 15/19. In Portugal, debt restructuring will unavoidably lead to the closure of many
unproductive firms, but that would be an important step toward reallocating resources to more productive activities.
According to firm-level data, Portugal’s highly-indebted low-productivity firms account for 25 percent of employment and
20 percent of debt, but only for 5 percent of value added.

Dealing with corporate debt overhang is a matter of particular importance. Successful
deleveraging would allow banks to reallocate resources away from less productive sectors of the
economy and toward viable firms, which will in turn contribute to higher economic growth. To
achieve this, a standardized bank-led, time-bound framework for restructuring—which would ideally
entail an accelerated pace of SME restructuring and large-scale write-offs for the banks—is
needed.13
Authorities’ views
23.
The authorities concurred that additional steps should be taken, both at national and
European levels, to strengthen bank balance sheets and restore profitability to the banking
sector. They underscored that high levels of non-performing loans are present in several euro area
banking systems and therefore a systemic European solution for this issue—such as a pan-European
asset management corporation—is required. The current low interest rate environment and the
economic cycle are not favorable for Portuguese banks, despite the easing of financing conditions
afforded by ECB’s accommodative monetary policy. Banks also face additional hurdles in cleaning up
their balance sheets because the current framework (BRRD) restricts the use of public money outside
the resolution process, while allowing it only under exceptional circumstances during resolution.

B.

Fiscal adjustment

24.
The authorities’ 2016 fiscal target appears at risk in the absence of additional
measures to support spending restraint. The cash outturn for January-May shows a sizable underexecution of spending relative to the budget, reflecting significant efforts to contain discretionary
expenditure. Revenue is expected to fall short of the full-year target as specified in the 2016 budget
by 0.6 percent of GDP, however, with growth projected to decline well below the budget assumption
of 1.8 percent, while maintaining expenditure restraint in the second half of the year is likely to be
difficult. Spending pressures are likely to emerge from the move to the 35-hour work week for the
majority of civil servants at the beginning of July, the continued rollback of public sector wage cuts
and some catch-up in capital spending. The increase in arrears and non-financial debt during
January-May, particularly from hospitals, already suggests that spending pressures may be building
from the containment of intermediate consumption. In the absence of additional measures, staff
projects a deficit of 3 percent of GDP, compared with the official target of 2.2 percent.
Staff views
25.
Portugal remains uniquely vulnerable to shifts in market sentiment. The high stock of
public debt, large refinancing needs, potential liabilities stemming from the financial sector, and low
growth and inflation projected for the foreseeable future all point to the fact that fiscal policy should

PORTUGAL

be guided by debt sustainability considerations. At current levels, debt dynamics remain vulnerable
to even relatively small shocks.
26.
A credible fiscal adjustment is therefore needed to put public debt on a firmly
downward trajectory and ensure the medium-term sustainability of public finances. Even
though the objective of fiscal policy is often perceived as trying to meet a three-percent headline
deficit target annually—viewed by many commentators as Portugal’s European fiscal commitment—
the public debate should internalize the need for realistic and appropriately paced fiscal
consolidation. The authorities’ Stability Program (SP) targets a 2.6-percent-of-GDP adjustment in the
nominal fiscal deficit from 2016-2020, to be achieved through a decrease in the public sector wage
bill, rationalization of intermediate consumption, reduction in fraudulent claims for social transfers,

27.
A structural primary adjustment of 0.5 percent of GDP in 2017 and 2018 would be an
appropriate fiscal path, but that should be underpinned by credible measures. The focus of
fiscal adjustment should be on spending reform, in particular in public wages and pensions, given
Portugal’s already-high tax burden. The authorities have recently launched a bottom-up exercise to
identify scope for efficiency gains in the areas of health, education, public administration, and stateowned enterprises. Due to its non-systematic nature and lack of clear savings objective, however,
such an exercise falls short of a comprehensive spending review needed to generate a lasting
impact on the government's outlays. Going forward, the spending review should adopt a more topdown approach to fix the overall spending envelope of the general government, and take a
medium-term perspective to achieve more ambitious savings, anchored on the SP’s fiscal targets
and locked in the annual budgets. Priority should be given to the most promising areas for
generating savings, as follows:

The projected decline in public debt also assumes substantial revenues from the sale of government-owned financial
sector assets, which would be used to reduce new debt issuance.

a. There is a significant scope to improve the impact of public spending on poverty and
inequality and to reduce growth of healthcare cost. Stronger means-testing of social benefits
would reduce fiscal costs, as Portugal has one of the highest shares of social benefits going to
the high-income households. To partially offset the pressures from population aging, policies to
reduce healthcare costs should be expanded and pursued forcefully (see Box 2 and SIP).

b. A clear strategy is needed to underpin the authorities’ plan to reduce the public sector
wage bill. The targets presented in the SP rely heavily on natural attrition and could prove
difficult to achieve given the full reversal of the program-era nominal wage cuts and the partial
reinstatement of 35-hour work week in 2016. The authorities should adopt a well-specified
strategy, including (i) exempting the health sector from the implementation of the 35-hour
week, and pursuing school network consolidation given the declining school-age population; (ii)
increasing the rate of natural attrition to gradually reduce public employment; (iii) reducing the
wage premium relative to the private sector, by rationalizing allowances and supplements; and
(iv) limiting the wage drift, by streamlining career path and maintaining the freeze in career
progression beyond 2018.
c. While recent pension reforms will generate large savings in the long term and should be
preserved, more action is needed to reduce the high level of pension spending in the short
term. Reforms introduced to date will generate savings only over the long term due to extensive
grandfathering rules that protect current retirees, while placing a substantial adjustment burden
on future generations of retirees (see Box 2). Revisiting recent pension reforms should address
inequities across generations and pension schemes including by accelerating the convergence
between the public and private sector schemes and avoiding an increase in pensions’
contribution that would finance higher benefits.
28.
The tax policy reforms outlined in the 2016 Stability Program have not been fully
articulated, but appear to fall short of what is needed to boost competitiveness and growth.
Tax policy is primarily geared toward supporting household income to increase domestic

consumption through the complete elimination of the PIT surcharge by 2017, a reduction in the VAT
rate for restaurants from July 2016, and a fiscally-neutral increase in income tax progressivity. More
marginally, the government also intends to support corporate investment by expanding the
targeted tax incentives for investment and SMEs. The government’s other priorities include reducing
compliance costs and the bias towards debt by corporates, which are in line with staff’s earlier
recommendations.15 Overall, a more stable and predictable tax system is needed to stimulate
corporate investment.
Authorities’ views
29.
The authorities were confident that their 2016 fiscal target as articulated in the budget
(a 2.2-percent-of-GDP deficit) is within reach. They were encouraged by the January-May
outturn, and optimistic that strong private consumption would help support revenue collection
despite the slower headline growth. The authorities also noted that the frozen appropriation for
purchases of goods and services has been increased in the 2016 budget, and believed that this
should provide sufficient buffer to withstand any additional spending needs that might emerge in
the second half of the year. They also cited scope for increased efficiency in the health sector that
could help minimize any increase in overtime costs resulting from the shift to the 35-hour work
week for some health professionals.
30.
The authorities remain committed to the fiscal plans laid out in the SP, including a
deficit target of 1.4 percent of GDP for 2017. They re-affirmed their commitment to the
downsizing of the public sector through natural attrition, and hiring caps in line with replacement
rules and were confident that the recently-launched spending review would effectively underpin the
planned rationalization of intermediate consumption. In particular, they favored a deep bottom-up
spending review in the areas they have identified for the ongoing exercise, with a subsequent
broadening to other areas. The authorities also emphasized that any changes to the pension system
would be mindful of both the long-term financial sustainability of the system and the existing rights
of current beneficiaries.

C.

Structural reforms

31.
There has been little forward movement on structural reforms since the end of the
adjustment program. Proposals to link future increases in minimum wages to productivity were set
aside after the expiration of the program, and the minimum wage was raised in October 2014 by
4 percent. The minimum wage was raised once more in January 2016 by 5 percent, and
accompanied by the reinstatement of four public holidays eliminated during the 2011-14 EFF, and a
reopening of the TAP privatization and the public transport concessions, by renegotiating the
former and suspending the Carris, STCP, and Metro de Lisboa subconcessions.16 The structural

PORTUGAL

reform agenda centers on developing human capital, reducing labor market segmentation17, raising
the minimum wage, and reforming state-owned enterprises18 and public administration19, although
the details have yet to be specified fully.20 Even though the interim objectives for eliminating the
energy sector’s tariff debt were met in 2015, the full tariff debt is now projected to be eliminated
only in 2024 (four years after the target date under the program) to a large extent due to an
increase in tariff subsidies.21 Finally, the authorities announced a partial reversal of the 2014 judicial
road map intended to consolidate locations and resources of court services to permit judicial
specialization and enhance the efficiency of the courts.22 In the absence of consolidated data,
anecdotal evidence suggests that further efficiency gains are needed in the fiscal/administrative, and
insolvency courts.
Staff views
32.
Raising Portugal’s growth potential is essential to accelerate income convergence and
spur job creation. This takes on increased urgency in light of Portugal’s demographic challenges,
with an aging population and a declining labor force (Box 2). Raising Portugal’s growth potential will
require fully implementing the already-enacted reforms in labor and product markets to ensure that
statutory changes are translated into tangible outcomes. Fresh labor market reforms are also
needed, particularly with regard to re-integration of the longer-term unemployed and lower-skilled
workers. There is little scope to reverse the policies that have made hiring and collective bargaining
more flexible, since doing so could have adverse consequences for Portugal’s growth outlook and
prospects.
33.
Uncertainty over the direction over structural reforms appears to be a significant
factor in the slowdown in investment. While the authorities have not introduced any further

In this area, the particular focus is on limiting temporary contracts, self-employment, and the scope for individual firms to
deviate from sectoral collective bargaining agreements.

17

18
The improvement in consolidated operational results of the state-owned enterprises has fallen short of government’s
targets. At end-September 2015, negative net income was about 6 times higher than projected, driven by the transport and
health sectors, and the consolidated positive EBITDA is 44 percent lower than anticipated, mainly due to hospitals’
underperformance.
19

Efforts in this area are geared toward reducing red tape, simplifying the legal framework, and increasing decentralization.

The National Reform Program (NRP) for 2016 puts forward initiatives to improve the skills of the labor force through
reforms to the national education system, and additional funding for research in science and technology and IT training
programs. In addition, the NRP seeks to foster innovation through investment in start-ups and SMEs. Financing for these
various initiatives would primarily come from EU structural funds.

20

Since 2006, the payments to electricity producers have been independent from demand, determined through contracts
that hedged against oil price fluctuations, whereas end-user prices were set below cost. This resulted in multi-year tariff
deficits, which generated a stock of tariff debt of €5 billion at end-2015.

21

The implementation of a new judicial road map was intended to better align Portugal with European judiciary standards,
and entailed closing 20 courts and converting 27 more to proximity sections. Prior to the implementation of the road map
in 2014, Portugal had 3.18 courts and 19.2 judges per 100,000 inhabitants – significantly above the EU average of 2.37
courts per 100,000 inhabitants. The authorities have announced that all judicial units will be designated as courts and that
five of the previous proximity sections will have permanent judges y.

22

PORTUGAL

changes in the labor market beyond the increase in the minimum wage, measures to protect
sectoral collective bargaining—restraining the use of temporary contracts and limiting the flexibility
for firm-level negotiations—remain under discussion. A change in the direction of reforms would
add to the uncertainty already weighing on investment and diminish medium-term growth
prospects. In particular, any unwinding of past policies that have succeeded in making hiring and
collective bargaining more flexible would have adverse consequences for employment and the
competitiveness of Portuguese firms (see Annex V).
34.
An ambitious program of structural reforms is also needed to support the
consolidation efforts, and promote growth and competitiveness. An efficient and effective
public sector is essential for unlocking Portugal’s growth potential through its positive effects on
investor confidence, private employment and competitiveness. Priority should be given to
streamlining the functioning of the public sector and limiting the energy costs. In particular:
Public administration reforms envisaged in the 2016 SP are limited and unlikely to generate
savings. A more ambitious reform agenda is needed to reduce duplication in public service
provision and improve efficiency at all levels of government. The authorities should also put
more emphasis on the implementation of the new Budget Framework Law, which has suffered
delays. Priority should be given to reinforcing the medium-term budget framework, reducing
budget fragmentation, strengthening the financial management function in line ministries, and
reinforcing transparency.

In the judicial sector, the authorities should put on hold the reinstatement of courts and
expansion of services pending a full consideration of a detailed cost-benefit analysis with the
overall objective to bring the number of courts more closely in line with the European average.
Efforts to improve the processing efficiency and reduce the disposition time in
fiscal/administrative and insolvency courts should continue.

The government should continue restructuring public enterprises forcefully and ensure that all

As outlined in earlier reports, an appropriately inclusive social dialogue is key to
success of structural reforms. Engaging all stakeholders—including the unemployed, the broader
labor force, and a wider cross-section of employers—in an open and transparent debate about the
relative merits of reforms versus inaction will be crucial to creating and sustaining a pro-reform
coalition in civil society.23
Authorities’ views
36.
The authorities emphasized their commitment to carry forward the structural reforms
implemented during the program. On the labor market, they noted that any changes would not
constitute a change in the direction of reforms, but were intended to address social inequities that
had emerged from growing labor market segmentation and the erosion of labor protection
following the financial crisis.

POST-PROGRAM MONITORING
37.
The risks to Portugal’s capacity to repay are rising, but are expected to be manageable
under the baseline. DBRS has maintained its investment-grade rating with a stable outlook, but
most other outstanding risks—the sovereign’s excessive reliance on external financing being
principal among them—remain in place, and sovereign spreads and yields remain elevated.
38.
Portugal’s debt management agency has been improving the profile of outstanding
debt but has revised down its target cash balance for the end of the year. The average annual
maturity of non-IMF/EU debt has risen from 5.1 years in 2013 to the current 6.7 years through a
focus on long-term issuance and recent short-term debt buybacks. Debt risk metrics—such as gross
financing needs and the debt-to-maturity ratio—are elevated, but remain inside the range of other
high-yield and even some medium-yield European economies. Portugal has made €10.3 billion in
advanced repurchases to the Fund in the PSPP era. Staff would welcome early payment

39.
Market confidence remains essential. Spreads have been higher in 2016 than at any time
since Portugal renewed the long-term debt auctions in April 2014. Further negative surprises in the
financial sector, a renewed period of political instability arising from disagreements within the
parties that support the Government in Parliament or with the EC, or external risks—such as fallout
from the U.K. referendum, accelerated US monetary policy normalization, or a hard landing in
China—could all push spreads even higher. PSPP purchases have been providing a guaranteed
source of demand, but will likely hit the ECB’s self-imposed limit of 33 percent of outstanding debt
in early 2017, absent changes in the PSPP parameters.24

STAFF APPRAISAL
40.
Portugal has achieved a major economic turnaround since the onset of the sovereign
debt crisis. Following the 2011-14 EFF, macroeconomic stability was regained and the economy
began to recover from a deep recession. At the same time, comfortable market access was restored,
current account deficits turned into surpluses and unemployment, though still high, has fallen from
the peak of the crisis.
41.
Notwithstanding these accomplishments, the economy is now at a challenging
juncture. The consumption-based recovery of the past three years is running out of steam, the fiscal
stance remains expansionary, the current account is weakening, and the banking system is plagued
by low profitability and rising NPLs. Sovereign financing conditions are sensitive to global
developments and are being supported to a large extent by ECB’s PSPP, and the yields on
Much of primary market demand is associated with the continued presence of the ECB as a secondary market buyer. The
ECB is expected to purchase at least €6.6 billion in Portuguese bonds over the next 6 months against a planned issuance of
€5.6 billion under the government’s current fiscal projections.

Portuguese bonds, albeit low by historical standards, have diverged from those for Spain and Italy.
The vulnerabilities in the banking system, public sector finances, and the macroeconomic outlook
can potentially be self-reinforcing, with risks firmly on the downside.
42.
A comprehensive approach is needed to address vulnerabilities in the banking system.
To return to profitability and successfully finance economic growth, banks should clean up their
balance sheets through a comprehensive approach to debt restructuring supported by an increase
in capital, provisions, and impairments and by appropriately pricing and selling bad loans. In
addition, banks should also reduce operating costs and improve their internal governance to let
lending decisions be guided solely by commercial criteria. Solutions to the challenges facing
Portuguese banks will ultimately need to be found at the national level, using the existing regulatory
toolkit.
43.
The 2016 budget target—a deficit of 2.2 percent of GDP—is appropriately ambitious
but faces risks to execution. Even though the January-May outturn was broadly in line with the
authorities’ projections, declining GDP growth and emerging expenditure pressures—due to the
move to the 35-hour work week for civil servants, the continued rollback of public sector wage cuts,
and rising arrears—point to a deficit of close to 3 percent of GDP.
44.
In view of vulnerabilities due to the high stock of public debt, the authorities need a
credible fiscal strategy. With little room for corrective measures in 2016, policies need to look
ahead. Well-specified measures, largely on the expenditure side and resulting in a structural primary
adjustment of 0.5 percent of GDP in 2017 and 2018, would be an appropriate way forward. The
authorities may wish to consider undertaking a top-down spending review, focusing in particular on
better means-testing of social benefits, reducing healthcare costs, and controlling pensions and
public sector wages. Tax policy should be more stable and predictable and aim at boosting
competitiveness and growth rather than consumption.
45.
The authorities should address uncertainty over the direction of structural reforms.
Structural reforms are essential for raising Portugal’s growth potential, but the recent reversals—
among others, an increase in the minimum wage, reinstatement of public holidays, and revisiting of
transport concessions—have generated uncertainty that appears to be a significant factor behind
the slowdown in investment. Full implementation of the already-enacted reforms in labor and
product markets must be complemented by additional steps to promote growth and
competitiveness, with a particular focus on streamlining the functioning of the public sector and
limiting the energy costs. Engaging all stakeholders by way of an appropriately inclusive social
dialogue will be key to success of structural reforms.
46.
Maintaining an adequate cash buffer becomes a priority. The authorities’ commitment to
repay Fund early is welcome, provided that adequate cash buffers can be maintained, in view of
elevated spreads and pronounced risks.
47.
Staff recommends the next Article IV consultation be held on the standard 12-month
cycle.

Box 1. Banking System Challenges and Their Implications for Growth and Stability
The Portuguese banking system continues to suffer from high and rising non-performing loans. The
majority of weak assets are loans to low-productivity firms in the nontradable sector. This legacy impedes
the reallocation of credit to new higher-productivity sectors of the economy, while leaving the banking
system vulnerable to negative shocks. A comprehensive solution to the banking system’s challenges is
therefore necessary to elevate Portugal’s growth prospects and to safeguard financial stability.
Notwithstanding the macro-criticality of this issue, the prospects for progress are challenging: with
inflation, growth, and interest rates all expected to remain low for long, Portuguese banks will not be able to
generate sufficient profits in the foreseeable future to bolster capital cushions. With state ownership of
CGD and Resolution Fund ownership of Novo Banco, two of the four major (and SSM-supervised) banks, and
majority shareholders firmly in control of the other two, there is little impetus to aggressively cut costs
and/or undertake measures that dilute ownership.
The true extent of a complete and decisive cleaning up bank NPLs is difficult to estimate. At the low
end, the cost of raising the major banks’ provisioning to 80 percent of recorded NPLs would entail around
€3.5 billion (2 percent of GDP) in additional capital needs. This level of provisioning has been seen as the
minimum needed by some of the healthier banks to dispose of NPLs without additional charges and can
serve as a useful conservative benchmark. However, recent experience with Banif suggests that recorded
NPLs may understate the true extent of the problem and overstate the residual value of assets. Applying
more conservative assumptions would imply potentially larger system-wide costs of cleaning up legacy
assets but would require access to detailed bank-level data to estimate with any degree of confidence.
Given the potential size of the problem and the incentives among banks in favor of the status quo,
banks need to be more aggressive in addressing both legacy issues and improving their internal
governance framework. While addressing legacy problems is an essential step to freeing up economic
resources for new investment and job creation, there needs to be a fundamental change in the banking
culture. In part, this means moving away from a bias towards lending to traditional corporates with whom
banks have long-standing relationships. Moreover, banks’ management should have the flexibility to
restructure their operations and aggressively rein in costs, including through a reduction in branch network
and staffing. Unless banks are focused on profitability and continuous reinforcement of capital buffers from
their own resources, there is a high risk of onset of chronic banking system stress and calls for injection of
public funds at repeated intervals. This would reinforce unhelpful bank-sovereign links and could lead to the
build-up of problems in the future.

Box 2. The Demographic Challenge
Portugal is projected to face large adverse demographic developments. According to UN projections,
Portugal’s population has started to decline (by
2.2 percent between 2010 and 2015), and would

(Index 2015 = 100)

baseline scenario, driven by continued migration

in the medium and long terms. As a consequence,
85
the old age-dependency ratio would more than

double in Portugal by 2050. These demographic

the long run.

These demographic developments would have a significant impact on economic growth. A reduction
in the working-age population would negatively affect output, making it more difficult to reduce Portugal’s
high debt-to-GDP ratio over time. Labor market reforms could partially mitigate this trend by increasing
labor force participation and reducing unemployment.
Shrinking population would place public finances under pressure, as age-related spending will
significantly increase. With recent reforms limiting the fiscal impact of higher old-age dependency ratio,
pension spending should remain roughly stable, albeit still significantly above Euro area average (by about
5 percentage points of GDP in 2050). However, total age-related spending would increase sharply under the
baseline (about 6 percentage points of GDP in 2050), driven by health expenditure.2
Therefore, a multi-pronged approach is needed to rein in age-related spending. Priority should be
given to policies that affect demographics and labor markets in order to increase fertility rates, reverse
migration outflows, and raise labor force participation of women and elderly. To rein in spending, the
authorities should avoid policy-reversing pension reforms, while reducing grandfathering to generate
savings in the short run. Improving efficiency of health spending would contain the growing costs of health
care in the long run.

The banking system data present a break in time series in 2014Q3 due to the resolution measure applied to Banco Espírito Santo (BES). The break in time series stems, in particular, from the fact that the assets/liabilities not transferred to the balance sheet of Novo Banco (NB) are not

considered in the aggregate of the banking system from August 2014 onwards. In the absence of accounting information for BES on a consolidated basis for the period from 30 June 2014 to the day of implementation of the resolution measure (closing balance sheet and statement of profit or
loss), the reporting of BES on an individual basis, with reference to 31 July 2014, was considered when determining the aggregate results of the banking system for 2014Q3. However, the adjustments stemming from the resolution measure applied to BES were also not considered.

Derived as [r - g - r(1+g) + ea(1+r)]/(1+g+r+gr) times previous period debt stock, with r = nominal effective interest rate on external debt; r = change in domestic GDP deflator, g = real GDP growth

1

rate, e = nominal appreciation (increase in dollar value of domestic currency--not used here), and a = share of domestic-currency denominated debt in total external debt.
The contribution from price and exchange rate changes is defined as [-r(1+g) + ea(1+r)]/(1+g+r+gr) times previous period debt stock. r increases with an appreciating domestic currency (e > 0) and

2

rising inflation (based on GDP deflator).
For projection, line includes the impact of price and exchange rate changes.

3

Defined as current account deficit, plus amortization on medium- and long-term debt, plus short-term debt at end of previous period.

4

The key variables include real GDP growth; nominal interest rate; deflator growth; and both non-interest current account and non-debt inflows in percent of GDP.

5

Long-run, constant balance that stabilizes the debt ratio assuming that key variables (real GDP growth, nominal interest rate, deflator growth, and non-debt inflows in percent of GDP) remain at their

levels of the last projection year.

Exchange rates reflect actual exchange rates where available, otherwise historical and projected WEO annual averages for flows and end-of-period values for stocks.
Projections assume further advanced Fund repurchases in 2016–17, in line with the amount approved by Portugal’s European partners. In the absence of additional
advanced repurchases, Portugal’s next repurchase is not due until September 2018.

The coverage of this table has been expanded to fully reflect all general government (including local and regional
governments and SOES) financing operations. However, data are on a non-consolidated basis (with intra-government flows
presented where available). On a consolidated basis, they are smaller, by the amount of intra-government transactions.
2
For projection years, all treasury bill issuance is assumed to be short term (i.e. at maturities of 12 months or below).
3
For EFSM loans, outstanding loans are assumed to be rolled over for an additional 7 years, as agreed with the EU. Projections
assume further advanced Fund repurchases in 2016–17, in line with the amount approved by Portugal’s European partners. In
the absence of additional advanced repurchases, Portugal’s next repurchase is not due until September 2018.
4
Includes use of Bank Solvency Support Facility and other net financial transactions, net financing from retail government
securities programs, as well as adjustments for cash-accrual differences and consistency between annual projections and
preliminary quarterly accounts.
5
Changes in government deposits (including deposits in BSSF).

For EFSF loans, outstanding loans are assumed to be rolled over for an additional 7 years, as agreed with the EU. Projections assume
further advanced Fund repurchases in 2016–17, in line with the amount approved by Portugal’s European partners. In the absence of
additional advanced repurchases, Portugal’s next repurchase is not due until September 2018.

Annex I. Main Recommendations of the 2015 Article IV
Consultation and Authorities’ Response
Fund policy recommendations

Policy actions

1. Fiscal adjustment
(a) Fiscal policy should be anchored around
an annual structural primary adjustment
of 0.5 percent of GDP.

(a.1) Multi-year expenditure targets
should be introduced to underpin a
fiscal adjustment based on spending
rationalization.
(a.2) Specific policy measures to contain
spending should be identified to
enforce the expenditure targets, with
a focus on public sector wages and
pensions.
(a.3) Priority should be given to the
finalization and adoption of a new
Budget Framework Law to improve
budget preparation and execution.

The authorities’ 2016 budget targets a primary structural
adjustment of 0.2 percent of GDP, although there are
significant risks to execution. The medium-term fiscal
strategy targets an annual primary structural adjustment of
0.3 percent of GDP, although this depends in part on
optimistic macroeconomic assumptions.
The 2016 budget frontloaded the unwinding of public
sector wage cuts, to be offset by hikes in a range of
indirect taxes. The authorities’ medium-term fiscal strategy
envisages a fiscal adjustment based on expenditure
savings from a reduction of the public sector wage bill and
rationalization of intermediate consumption, but contains
little specificity on the required reforms. There are no
immediate plans for introduction of multi-year expenditure
ceilings.
The Budget Framework Law was approved in July 2015,
but implementation has moved slowly.

2. Corporate deleveraging
(b) Eliminating the corporate debt overhang
is essential for Portugal’s recovery .

Corporate deleveraging has moved slowly and high
corporate indebtedness continues to constrain the pace of
recovery. The large share of banks’ assets tied up in
unviable enterprises limits their space for new lending,
while overleveraged households and corporates are not in
a position to accumulate more debt.

(b.1) Banks should raise more capital and
accelerate the pace of write-offs.

Banks have struggled to raise capital, reflecting weak
profitability and concerns about asset quality. This in turn
has limited their scope to deal more aggressively with
NPLs and accelerate write-offs.

(b.2) The authorities should advance
corporate governance reform to
encourage firms to increase equity
and reduce the tax debt bias.

The authorities’ National Reform Program aims to increase
investment in start-ups and SMEs by accessing EU
structural funds.

3.

Structural reforms to restore
competitiveness and growth

(c) Increase the effectiveness of the public
sector and judicial system, and improve
the payment discipline of public sector
entities.

In 2016, the authorities announced a partial reversal of the
2014 judicial road map intended to consolidate locations
and resources of court services to permit judicial
specialization and enhance the efficiency of the courts.
There have also signs of slippage on payment discipline,
with a rise in public arrears in the first half of the year.

(d) Assess implementation gaps in measures
to reduce the cost of energy, use of
transport infrastructure and professional
services. Provide greater resources and
political support for the competition
authority.

The interim objectives for eliminating the energy sector’s
tariff debt were met in 2015, but the full tariff debt is now
projected to be eliminated only in 2024 (four years after
the target date under the program), primarily due to an
increase in tariff subsidies. There has been little movement
in other areas.

(e) Invest in vocational training and programs
to improve managerial skills. Develop a
more inclusive unemployment support
system and avoid premature increases in
the minimum wage.

The National Reform Program aims to improve the skills of
the labor force through reforms to the national education
system, and additional funding for research in science and
technology and IT training programs.

40

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

The minimum wage was raised by 5 percent in January
2016, and accompanied by the reinstatement of four
public holidays eliminated during the 2011-14 EFF. There
have been no other changes on the labor market to date,
but with discussions on possible measures to protect
sectoral collective bargaining, restrain the use of
temporary contracts and limit the flexibility for firm-level
negotiations.

Annex II. External Stability Report
Overall Assessment
Foreign
asset and
liability
position
and
trajectory

Background. The negative net international investment position (NIIP) declined from its peak
in 2012 of 117 percent of GDP to 109 percent of GDP at the end of 2015. This improvement
has been driven by the dramatic reversal of the current account balance through the crisis,
offset especially by improving external debt valuations. Gross external debt remains high at
222 percent of GDP. Both are expected to continue to decline but at a decelerating rate as the
current account moves to deficit.
Assessment. The large negative NIIP comes with external vulnerabilities, including from
valuation changes and the large gross financing needs from external debt. Recent debt
management efforts to reduce sovereign external risk, including by smoothing the profile for
redemptions and lengthening the average maturity of the portfolio to 6.7 years have
mitigated this risk somewhat. Nevertheless, Portugal remains exposed to a loss in confidence
by external investors.

Current
account

Background. The Portuguese current account achieved a surplus in 2013 after an extended
period of deficits in the range of 10 percent of GDP, led by a meaningful expansion of exports
as a percentage of GDP and a demand-driven contraction in imports. Since its peak surplus of
1.5 percent of GDP in 2013 the current account has drifted downward, in spite of significantly
lower oil prices and a depreciated euro. It is expected to return to deficit due to consumption
in 2017.
Assessment. EBA model-based estimates suggest an elimination of the current account gap,
representing a 2 percent decline since the 2014 assessment. Nevertheless, staff assesses the
current account surplus to be insufficient in view of the large NIIP deficit which needs to be
put on a sustained downward trajectory. Relative to a current account surplus which would
achieve a meaningful medium-term reduction in the NIIP, staff assesses a current account
short fall of between 2 and 4 percent of GDP, consistent with EBA results on the REER. By
contrast the current baseline is for a current account turning to deficit in the next 2 years.

Real
exchange
rate

Background. In 2015 the CPI-based real effective exchange rate (REER) declined by more than
5 percent from its pre-crisis peak while the unit labor cost-based REER fell by more than 10
percent, though labor costs in non-tradable sectors played an outsized role in this change.
While the euro has remained depressed in the aftermath of Brexit, Portugal is experiencing
higher inflation than other euro area countries while the increase in the minimum wage and
acceleration in public wage increases will likely put further pressure on competitiveness.
Assessment. The EBA’s index and level REER regression models indicate an overvaluation of 5
and 9 percent respectively for 2015. These metrics are in line with staff’s views about the
competitiveness challenges in Portugal and the need to put the NIIP deficit on a decisive
downward trajectory, and staff’s estimate of a current account shortfall of between 2 and 4
percent.

Capital and
financial
accounts:
flows and
policy
measures

Background. Financing conditions have eased dramatically since the resumption of sovereign
market access in 2014, but sovereign spreads to bunds demonstrate rising investor concern
but are contained by ECB purchases under PSPP. Wholesale funding of banks has continued to
decline sharply. External financing in general appears to be turning increasingly away from
equity towards debt-based instruments.
Assessment. A current account surplus and ECB policy actions have helped support external
financing rollover needs for the immediate future. Further policy action will be needed over
the medium term to maintain investor confidence and rule out negative equilibria.

FX
interventio
n and
reserves
level

Background. The euro has the status of a global reserve currency.
Assessment. Reserves held by the euro area are typically low relative to standard metrics, but
the currency is free floating.

Overall Assessment:
The external position in Portugal
in 2015 was weaker than that
consistent with medium-term
fundamentals and desirable
policy settings. In 2016 the CA is
projected to deteriorate
somewhat with rising import
demand, normalizing oil prices,
and domestic price pressures.
In particular, despite the strong
improvement in the current
account since the crisis,
reaching a more sustainable
NIIP position would require a
weaker effective exchange rate.
Potential policy responses:
Diminished reform momentum
in 2015 gave way to partial
reversals in 2016 which have
moderated the outlook for
sustained productivity
improvements. A renewed effort
to work out longstanding NPLs,
accelerate judicial procedures,
reduce electricity costs and
improve transport links would
help drive productivity
improvements. Fresh labor
market reforms to better
integrate the low-skilled and
long-term unemployed while
maintaining past reforms to
collective bargaining would help
improve competitiveness on the
cost side. Renewed fiscal
consolidation, in concert with
the ECB’s current
accommodative monetary
policy would help reduce net
interest payments and facilitate
external deleveraging.

likely to materialize in the view of IMF staff). The relative likelihood is the staff’s subjective assessment of the risks
surrounding the baseline (“low” is meant to indicate a probability below 10 percent, “medium” a probability between
10 and 30 percent, and “high” a probability between 30 and 50 percent). The RAM reflects staff views on the source
of risks and overall level of concern as of the time of discussions with the authorities. Non-mutually exclusive risks
may interact and materialize jointly. “Short term” and “medium term” are meant to indicate that the risk could
materialize within 1 year and 3 years, respectively.

Annex IV. Public Debt Sustainability Analysis (DSA)
Staff’s analysis, applying the Public DSA framework for Market-Access Countries, suggests that
Portugal’s gross debt trajectory is subject to significant risks, in the context of a sizable debt burden
and gross financing needs. Debt dynamics remain highly vulnerable to adverse yet plausible macrofiscal and contingent liabilities shocks, including the possible need for further fiscal support for the
financial sector. The risk of a contingent liabilities shock materializing remains elevated, in light of
financial sector vulnerabilities. Staff’s baseline projections reflect the authorities’ current fiscal policies;
additional fiscal consolidation remains critical to anchor debt safely on a downward-sloping path,
boosting policy credibility and strengthening the country’s resilience to reversals in market sentiment.

I. Baseline Scenario
1.

There was a modest decline in public debt in 2015 despite large fiscal costs related to

financial sector operations. Public debt fell from 130.2 to 129.0 percent of GDP at end-2015,
primarily reflecting a large drawdown of deposits, as the authorities used large cash reserves to help
finance early Fund repurchases. Portugal’s debt net of central government deposits rose further to
121.6 percent of GDP from 120 percent of GDP at end–2014. A modest decline in public debt is
projected to continue through 2021 as the headline fiscal deficit stabilizes just below 3 percent of
GDP, but public debt would still remain elevated at 126.0 percent of GDP in 2021. The further
drawdown of cash deposits from 2016–21 is projected to be modest, reflecting the authorities’
intention to maintain cover for 6 months’ refinancing needs. Potential proceeds from the sale of
financial sector assets (including Novo Banco) have not been included in the baseline, reflecting
considerable uncertainty over prospects for the sale of these assets.

II. Risk Assessment
2.

Portugal’s sizable debt burden and gross financing needs continue to pose significant

risks to debt sustainability and leave debt dynamics very sensitive to macro shocks. As shown
in Figure 1, Portugal’s debt ratio already exceeds the debt burden benchmark for advanced
economies of 85 percent of GDP under the baseline scenario. While the authorities have made
progress over the past year in borrowing at longer maturities in order to smooth the repayment
profile of public debt, Portugal’s public financing needs also exceed the relevant benchmark
of 20 percent of GDP during the projection period. However, the debt profile is subject to medium
to low risks in terms of market perception, projected change in short-term debt, and the share of

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

45

PORTUGAL

public debt held by nonresident.1 Moreover, in the case of Portugal, since bank vulnerabilities are
below the relevant thresholds identified by the MAC DSA template, the standardized contingent
liabilities shock does not apply. Nevertheless, this is replaced by a customized shock given the risks
posed by the materialization of contingent liabilities from SOEs and PPPs (please refer to the stress
test customized scenario).

III. Realism of Baseline Assumptions and Alternative Scenarios
3.

Realizing the potential growth rate assumed in the current projection has important

implications for the debt adjustment path. Portugal’s growth forecast track record shows a
relatively large median error compared with other countries with Fund-supported programs,
especially during the pre-crisis period (Figure 2). The achievement of a growth rate of 1.2 percent
over the medium term, as per staff’s updated projection, is consistent with moderate growth
convergence. If growth were to turn out lower than currently projected—for instance as a result of
reversal of structural reforms—the rate of debt decline would significantly slow down, as also shown
in Figures 4 and 5. Similarly, risks from a protracted period of negative inflation in Portugal could
further impede the repair of already-weak private and public balance sheets, as highlighted by the
customized deflation scenario in Figure 5.
4.

Given Portugal’s sizable debt burden and financing needs, the primary balance is

expected to exceed its debt-stabilizing threshold over the projection period. Under staff’s
baseline scenario,2 the fiscal primary balance is expected to stabilize at around 1.5 percent of GDP
over the medium term. Nevertheless, Portugal’s debt profile remains highly vulnerable to a primary
balance shock (Figures 4 and 5), as also highlighted by the asymmetric fan chart analysis in Figure 1,
which shows the risks to the debt outlook if only negative shocks to the primary balance were to
materialize. The authorities’ medium-term fiscal strategy under the Stability Program for 2016–20
envisages a reduction in public debt to 110.3 percent of GDP by 2020. However, this projection is
based on a very ambitious timetable for fiscal adjustment and incorporates optimistic assumptions
on both receipts from the sale of financial sector assets and medium-term growth. The Stability
Program assumes annual real GDP growth of 2.0 percent in 2017–20, as opposed to staff’s baseline
projection of average annual growth of 1.2 percent over the same period.

1

The total (public and private) external financing requirements exceed significantly the relevant benchmark under
the baseline. However, in the case of Portugal, the figure includes, among others, non-residents bank deposits,
accounting for about 45 percent of GDP.
2
In line with the WEO guidelines, medium-term assumptions that are not backed up by well-defined fiscal measures
are not incorporated by the team under the baseline scenario.

46

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

PORTUGAL

IV.

Stress Test

5.

The baseline remains highly sensitive to macro-fiscal and contingent liabilities shocks

(Figure 5):


Under a growth shock that lowers output by nearly 4.5 percentage points in 2016–17 (and in turn
inflation by a cumulative 1 percentage point), debt would peak at about 139 percent of GDP
in 2018, 11 percentage points higher than under the 2016 baseline. However, debt dynamics
would be severely compromised under a deflation scenario where a sharper growth shock (that
lowers output by 5½ percentage points in 2016–17) is associated with deflationary pressures
(with inflation lower by cumulative 4 percentage points), in the context of a widening output gap
and high unemployment. Under this scenario, debt would rise to 148 percent of GDP by 2018
and remain close to this level over the medium-term.



A sustained interest rate shock of 200 basis points throughout the projection period is not
expected to have a large immediate effect, but it would slow down the rate of debt decline in
the medium term, so that by 2020 the debt-to-GDP ratio is about 3 points higher compared
with the baseline.



Further materialization of contingent liabilities would also have implications for Portugal’s debt
dynamics. While the recent debt management operation for SOEs has significantly addressed
fiscal risks from the transport and infrastructure sectors, staff’s assessment suggests that, under
a severe scenario, further contingent liabilities could potentially materialize of about 10 percent
of GDP, due to financial sector risks, SOEs, PPPs, and State guarantees.3 A contingent liabilities
shock of this magnitude would push the 2017 debt ratio to 138 percent of GDP.



A severe combined shock that incorporates the macro-fiscal and contingent liabilities adverse
scenarios mentioned above would significantly affect the country’s debt dynamics, with debt
rising to 147 percent of GDP in 2018 and then remaining at this level over the medium term.

6.

The authorities took note of the risks highlighted by staff, but also stressed the

divergence of their medium-term outlook from staff’s baseline scenario. The authorities were
optimistic that reforms in recent years have laid the foundation for stronger export-oriented growth,

3
Staff’s assumptions for the adverse contingent liabilities scenario include (i) the hypothetical cost of further financial
sector operations; (ii) staff’s estimate of potential contingent liabilities from PPPs based on financial rebalancing
requests by concessionaires; (iii) the hypothetical settlement of the outstanding stock of arrears; (iv) staff’s estimate
of potential contingent liabilities from other non-bank debt directly guaranteed by the State and/or classified outside
the general government perimeter.

which would underpin a larger improvement in medium-term debt dynamics than projected by staff.
In addition, they remained confident that the 2016 fiscal deficit target will be achieved, resulting in a
larger reduction of the debt-to-GDP ratio by the end of the year, and putting debt dynamics on a
trajectory to improve at a faster pace than envisaged under staff’s baseline scenario. Over the
medium-term, the authorities reiterated their commitment to medium-term fiscal consolidation as
outlined in their 2016 Stability Program. In the near-term, they were optimistic that Portugal’s record
of fiscal adjustment and reform implementation under the adjustment program had strengthened
their credibility with investors, and would enable them to avoid any prolonged deterioration in
market access.

Annex V. No Extension Without Representation? New
Evidence on the Role of Extending Collective Bargaining
Agreements in Portugal1
In Portugal, administrative extensions of collective agreements had a negative impact on employment
growth in 2010-2011. Moreover, these effects tend to be concentrated among those firms that are not
directly involved in the bargaining process. The lack of representativeness of employer associations is a
potentially important factor behind the adverse effect of extensions. Another is the role of retro-activity
(backdating) in combination with the administrative time lags in processing extensions.
In many countries, including Portugal, collective bargaining coverage is supported by administrative
extensions that widen the reach of collective agreements beyond their signatory parties to all firms
and workers in the same sector. Because of their potential role in reinforcing downward wage
rigidity and exacerbating the negative impact of recessions on employment, extensions have
become the focus of an increasingly intense policy debate in recent years. A new study2 of collective
bargaining in Portugal provides the following insights into this subject:
First, extensions tended to reduce employment growth and, therefore, were likely to have amplified
the unemployment response to the sovereign debt crisis. The effect was large, with employment
growth at the firms that were subject to the subsequently-extended agreements lower by about 5
percentage points compared with that at the firms that were subject to the agreements that were
not extended (Figure 1).
Second, the adverse impact of extensions on employment growth tends to be concentrated among
the firms that are not affiliated with an employer association, i.e. those that are not directly involved
in the bargaining process. The concentration of adverse employment effects among the nonaffiliated firms suggests that extensions suit the interests of affiliated firms rather than those of nonaffiliated firms. In other words, the lack of representativeness of employer associations is a
potentially important factor behind the adverse effects of extensions.
Third, the degree of representativeness of employer associations does not appear to matter
significantly for the impact of extensions on employment growth. This may reflect the difficulty of
identifying the role of representativeness in a context when it is very low. Alternatively, it may reflect

Prepared by Alexander Hijzen (OECD).
Hijzen, A. and P. Martins (2016), “No Extension without Representation? Evidence from a Natural Experiment in
Collective Bargaining”, IMF Working Paper 16/143. This paper uses a regression discontinuity design that exploits the
sharp and unanticipated decline in the extension probability for the collective agreements signed in the months just
after March 1, 2011. That decline resulted from the immediate suspension of extensions by the government that took
office several months later, on June 21, 2011, in combination with the time needed for processing the extension
applications.

the possibility that representativeness criteria (such as those implemented in Portugal in 2012, based
on affiliated firms representing at least 50 percent of the workforce of the sector) do not ensure that
agreements are in the public interest. This suggests that representativeness criteria may need to be
fine-tuned further or be complemented with a meaningful test of public interest. However, the
introduction of the strict representativeness criteria in 2012 is likely to have had a major impact on
wage adjustment and therefore employment by greatly reducing the number of extensions issued.
Representativeness criteria also may help to promote employer organization, particularly if
introduced gradually, and thereby contribute to the quality of industrial relations as well as the
degree of trust between the social partners.
Fourth, the retro-activity in combination with the often substantial administrative time lags
associated with extension decisions implied that non-affiliated firms had to back pay wage increases
over the period from the time that the original agreement was signed until the time that a decision
on its extension was made. This significantly increased the adverse impact of extensions on
employment growth. This may suggest that the present results are to some extent specific to the
weak economic conditions during the period of analysis. If there is no uncertainty about the
extension of agreements and firms are not liquidity-constrained, then retro-activity should not be
expected to slow down employment growth. It also suggests that the 2012 labor market reform may
have helped to reduce the adverse effect of extensions by removing their retro-activity. Concerns
that this undermines the spirit of sectoral bargaining and extensions can partly be addressed by
shortening the administrative delay associated with issuing extensions.
To conclude, the positive effects of extensions in terms of higher wages for low-wage workers and
greater wage compression should be weighed against their adverse effects on employment growth.

STATISTICAL ISSUES
As of July 12, 2016
I. Assessment of Data Adequacy for Surveillance
General. Data provision to the Fund is adequate for surveillance purposes.
Real sector. Since 2000, and until August 2014, INE published a full set of national accounts
based on the ESA 1995 methodology, including quarterly GDP estimates. Since September
2014, all information regarding National Accounts follows the ESA 2010.
Fiscal sector. Data have undergone a number of revisions during the transition to the ESA
2010, sizably altering revenue and expenditure and hampering comparisons across years. From
2001 onward, budgets have been presented in a manner consistent with recent changes in
national and fiscal accounting methodology. Quarterly general government statistics on an
accrual basis are available as derived from the national accounts statistics.
Trade and balance of payments. Data are provided according to the IMF’s sixth edition of the
Balance of Payments Manual. The external trade data meet the timeliness standards. The
portfolio investment collection system has a simplified threshold of €500 million, which is
relatively high in comparison with many EU countries. The authorities estimate however, that
only about 1.5 percent of transactions are not captured on a monthly basis by this threshold,
and that this reporting simplification does not significantly hamper the quality of the monthly
balance of payments. Moreover, they indicate that all transactions below this threshold are
included in the first release of the annual balance of payments data, and the monthly numbers
are revised accordingly.
Monetary sector. Data on the central bank balance sheet and on the consolidated balance
sheet of other monetary financial institutions are available from the Bank of Portugal’s BPStat
website.
II. Data Standards and Quality
Portugal is subject to the statistical requirements
and timeliness and reporting standards of Eurostat
and the European Central Bank (ECB). Portugal
subscribes to the Special Data Dissemination
Standard Plus (SDDS+), and the relevant metadata
have been posted on the Dissemination Standards
Bulletin Board.

Statement by Mr. Cottarelli, Executive Director for Portugal,
and Ms. Lopes, Advisor to the Executive Director
September 16, 2016

I – Overview
We thank staff for the report on the Article IV consultation and the fourth Post-Program
Monitoring (PPM) discussions. We also thank staff for the report on the Ex-Post Evaluation
of Exceptional Access (EPE) under the 2011 Extended Arrangement. As the Portuguese
authorities have had the opportunity to comprehensively express their views on the EPE
separately, the current statement will focus on the Article IV and fourth PPM report.
The Portuguese Government takes note of the Staff Report on the fourth Post-Program
Monitoring and Article IV Consultation and reiterates its commitment to economic and fiscal
policies that promote competitiveness, economic growth and social cohesion, together with
sound and sustainable public finances.
Several structural reforms, clearly outlined in the National Reform Program, are presently
being implemented, thus strengthening the reform momentum. The assessment made by
Fund staff does not fully recognize this progress, downplaying the present structural reform
agenda.
Moreover, the Portuguese Government would like to highlight that, between the third PPM
Mission (January 2016) and this fourth Mission, the State Budget, the Stability Program and
the National Reform Program were all approved by Parliament, and subsequently welcomed
by the European Commission. The report understates the value of political stability in a
socio-political environment where a low Eurosceptic sentiment prevails.
The Portuguese economy is recovering from a weak second half of 2015. Recovery signs are
still mild and should be supported by appropriate policies. Portuguese exports are gaining
market share to the EU. Economic confidence indicators are rising. Recent data points to a
more dynamic labor market. These encouraging developments also impact positively on
budgetary outcomes. The Portuguese Government is aware of the existence of downside
risks, such as possible external shocks coming, for example, from economic developments in
emerging markets. Against this background, the Portuguese Government reiterates its

2
commitment to a rigorous implementation of the 2016 State Budget as agreed in the National
Assembly and with the European partners. Additionally, the Portuguese Government
continues to be engaged in working constructively with international institutions.
II – Economic Activity
In 2015, economic activity in Portugal decelerated gradually, mostly due to a slowdown in
investment and less favorable external demand from some of Portugal’s main trading
partners (mainly Angola). These factors spilled-over into the first half of 2016, although with
different magnitudes. Additionally, export performance was hindered by the temporary
closure of an oil refinery unit and the phasing-out of a major carmaker’s old car model. The
refinery is now fully operational and the production of a new car model will start in 2017.
Nonetheless, exports to EU markets – which represent over 70 percent of Portugal’s sales –
rose by 3.6 percent in June y-o-y and by 0.8 in July y-o-y. Importantly, labor market data
offer some positive indicators on the outlook for the rest of the year. The unemployment rate
stood at 10.8 percent in the second quarter of 2016 (11.9 percent in the same quarter of
2015), and the number of employees grew by 2.2 percent since the beginning of the year,
according to Social Security contributions’ data.
Private consumption grew at a rate close to the one envisaged in both the State Budget and
the Stability Program. Moreover, the economic climate indicator started accelerating at the
end of the first quarter, after a slowdown that started in the third quarter of 2015. Confidence
indicators in services, retail and construction are on the rise. The balance of payments
adjustment continues, with the trade balance surplus increasing by 242 million euro
compared to the first six months of 2015.
The Stability Program and the National Reform Program, approved by the National
Assembly and welcomed by the European Commission, laid down the Government’s
multiyear budgetary strategy as well as its reform agenda. Both are important to build
confidence and stability, benefiting investment decisions. These developments clearly bode
well for economic predictability and political stability, making staff’s emphasis on instability
uncalled for.
Additionally, the financial sector outlook has improved. Banif was resolved in December
2015 and CGD's recapitalization has been agreed with European institutions. Progress is also
being made by other private financial institutions. The authorities are committed to preserve
financial sector stability, which should also promote both an efficient transmission of
monetary policy measures and the financing of productive activities.
Likewise, in 2015, the real effective exchange rate depreciated by 2.7 percent (-0.5 percent in
2014), which points to gains in price competitiveness. The persistent gains of market share

3
and terms of trade point also towards an enhanced non-price competitiveness of Portuguese
exports.
III – Fiscal Policy
The Portuguese Government reiterates its commitment to a rigorous implementation of the
2016 State Budget. Portugal will achieve a result compatible with European rules and,
therefore, exit the Excessive Deficit Procedure this year.
Given a less favorable international financial environment, the 2016 State Budget introduced
new expenditure cuts that are curbing expenditure commitments by 0.2 percent of GDP since
March 31st.
In the first seven months of 2016, the general government budget deficit on a cash basis
improved by 0.4 percentage point of annual GDP vis-à-vis the same period of 2015.
Intermediate consumption is decreasing (-0.6 percent). The primary surplus stood at 316
million euro (901 million euro more than in 2015). This development is explained by a
higher increase in revenue (2.8 percent) than in expenditure (1.3 percent):




Net tax revenue increased by 1.9 percent. This performance is highly influenced by
an increase of 549 million euro in tax refunds decided in 2015. In gross terms, tax
revenue is increasing steadily, notably thanks to increases from taxes on oil and
energy products (44.9 percent), tobacco taxes (41.6 percent), and taxes on vehicles
(14.4 percent). CIT payments in July increased by 2.1 percent relatively to 2015.
Social contributions rose by 4.3 percent, largely due to the 4.5 percent increase of
Social Security contributions.

The Portuguese Government is committed to implement a spending review that goes beyond
the one launched during the Adjustment Program, with the objective of producing long-term
efficiency gains. The spending review is focused on the health and education sectors, major
SOEs, public procurement and the management of state-owned real estate assets. In the
following three years, the spending review will be expanded to other areas. The efficiency of
revenue collection will also be addressed.
IV – Structural Reforms
The Portuguese Government remains committed to the full implementation of structural
reforms, whose ambition, recognized by the European Commission, is reflected in the
Portuguese National Reform Program. This program builds on reforms implemented in
previous years and benefitted from their assessment by the European Commission, as
presented in the recent Country Report. The National Reform Program is translated into
concrete quantifiable measures and each of them has a chronogram of implementation. Some
of the measures involve support from EU Structural Funds, the Junker Plan or the European
Investment Bank.

4
Several structural reforms are currently being implemented. These are broadly framed in
programs to foster the skills of the labor force, the recapitalization of firms and the
modernization of Public Administration, making the latter closer to citizens and to business,
thus reducing costs for both.
This translated into the launching of: i) Programa Qualifica to develop human capital,
namely the qualification of the workforce through better formal education and lifelong
learning, as well as improvements in managerial skills in internationalization; ii) Programa
Capitalizar for firms, with more than 100 measures to change tax incentives for equity usage,
simplification of procedures, corporate restructuring, leverage productive investment and
improve the access to equity markets; iii) a revamped Simplex + to modernize Public
Administration, containing a large number of changes that will significantly improve the
business environment for firms, thereby facilitating productivity and competitiveness gains;
iv) Programa Capacitar, aiming to improve applied R&D and innovation by strengthening
the role of interface entities (e.g. technological centers) between universities, laboratories and
companies, facilitating the diffusion of technology; v) Startup Portugal, the national strategy
for entrepreneurship, aimed at facilitating the birth and development of new enterprises, as
well as promoting international investment and a focus on international markets.
Concerning the energy sector, the new measures under consideration by the Government to
further reduce the tariff debt should be noted.
Finally, in late 2015, the Portuguese Government established a dedicated unit to evaluate
structural reforms. This effort has been acknowledged by the OECD.
V – Financial Sector Policies
The Portuguese banking system has gone through a significant adjustment process in recent
years. However, at the end of the Adjustment Program several challenges remained. The
sector still faces important challenges that need to be addressed in the near future, taking into
account the European context. Currently, the most important challenges faced are the
resolution of high levels of non-performing loans (NPLs) in banks’ balance sheets and the
compliance with stringent capital requirements in a context of weak growth and compressed
profitability. The Portuguese authorities have been working to overcome the difficult
environment, while safeguarding the taxpayer and a normal flow of credit to the economy.
The turnaround in the liquidity profile of Portuguese banks since 2010, with the very
significant reduction in the loan to deposit ratio (from levels as high as 165 percent to just
below 105 percent in late 2015), is one of the most prominent features of the adjustment of
Portuguese banks. That trend continued during the first quarter of 2016, despite the concerns
raised at the beginning of the year related to two resolution measures applied to Portuguese
banks, which, however, did not have any impact on the retail deposit base of the banking
system. That resilience reveals the confidence of the public in the system as a whole. The

5
reliance on Eurosystem financing continued to decline in 2015, even though the ECB
pursued and intensified its quantitative easing measures. Finally, capital ratios have also
improved, when compared to 2014, mainly driven by the resolution measure applied to
Banco Espírito Santo, in December 2015, and by the decrease in risk weighted assets. In the
first quarter of 2016, the phase-in of CRDIV/CRR measures contributed to a slight reduction
of the Core Tier 1 ratio when compared to end-2015 figures.
Despite the progress, adjustment efforts should continue, as the Portuguese banking system
still faces significant challenges in several areas, most notably in reducing the high level of
NPLs and in regaining sustained and sufficient levels of profitability. The current low
economic growth (observed and projected), the very low nominal interest rates and low
inflation do not provide a favorable background to address these challenges. In 2015, even
though most banks returned to profits after several years of losses, the level of profits was
still feeble, although, in part, as a result of non-recurring factors. In the first quarter of 2016,
(annualized) profits remained at a level similar to 2015 and net interest income continued to
recover, on account of lower deposit interest rates, while income from financial operations,
by nature less recurring, declined. The restructuring efforts that led to the reduction in
administrative costs in 2015 continued to yield lower operating costs in the first quarter of
2016. Despite that, further efforts are needed, as banks continue to adjust to the current
macroeconomic scenario characterized by low levels of demand for financial services.
Restructuring should involve further downsizing and reallocation of human resources.
As mentioned before, the high stock of legacy assets on banks’ balance sheets, such as NPLs
and real estate, persists as a major micro and macroprudential concern given the impact on
banks’ capital and, potentially, on their ability and willingness to finance the economy. The
flow of NPLs has declined as a result not only of the timid cyclical upturn underway, but also
of the improvements in credit risk management processes that Portuguese banks have put in
place. Nevertheless, the NPL stock remains very high and the efforts to resolve this problem
will continue. In particular, given the multipronged nature of the problem, with intertwined
constraints at several levels, a holistic strategy, comprising measures on supervision, legal,
judicial and fiscal levels, must be continued and, in some cases, reinforced. Additionally, as
the high NPL stock is a problem common to various major banks in several European
countries, and considering their potential underlying impact on financial stability, a European
solution aimed at the removal of NPLs from banks’ balance sheets should be pursued.
Deleveraging at the non-financial corporations’ level continues, although at a slower pace.
The path of credit growth is very heterogeneous across firms: credit to those economic
activity sectors more affected by the macroeconomic adjustment and contraction in demand,
such as the construction and real estate sectors, continued to decline, while credit to
manufacturing and exporting companies is recovering. In addition, credit is being channeled
to those companies that rank better in the credit quality spectrum, while there is evidence of a
clear price discrimination according to the risk profile of the debtor. In the second quarter of

6
2016, the stock of credit to households for house purchase continued the declining path
initiated in 2011, while credit for consumption has been accelerating and showing positive
growth rates since the second half of 2015. The implementation of the above-mentioned
Programa Capitalizar should also support companies’ efforts to diversify their financing
sources and, simultaneously, to strengthen their capitalization with the contribution of
financial, fiscal and legal instruments.
The uncertainty underlying the global economic outlook, in conjunction with some
geographic concentration of banks’ activity, represents an additional risk for the banking
sector. In particular, the direct and indirect exposures of Portuguese banks to emerging
market economies (i.e. loans to corporations with significant commercial and investment
relations with those economies), as Angola, are significant and may lead, in the current
juncture, to additional losses for Portuguese banks.
Regarding Caixa Geral de Depositos, the state owned bank and the largest bank in Portugal,
an agreement on its recapitalization was reached between the Government and the European
institutions. The chosen approach is a market-based operation that allows for the bank to be
adequately capitalized and able to fulfill its mission, while complying with EU rules.
To sum up, despite some positive signals observed more recently (in terms, for instance, of
the banks’ financing structure and of firms’ deleveraging), the adjustment of the banking
sector is still ongoing and some significant challenges persist, notably regarding their
profitability and the high stock of NPLs.
VI – Conclusion
The Portuguese authorities are certain that their obligations towards the Fund will be timely
met, as has been the case so far.
Economic growth, social cohesion, sound public finances and financial stability are the goals
to be met, whilst the unintended effects of the adjustment process, i.e. rising inequality and
emigration, must, and will, be adequately tackled.
Structural reforms will continue to be implemented, based on the lessons learned from
previous efforts, with fine-tuning as needed, and with the launching of new initiatives in
order to achieve a competitive and balanced economy. Time and stability are required in
order for the reforms – implemented before, under and after the Economic and Financial
Adjustment Program − to produce the desired effects.
The Portuguese authorities look forward to the fifth PPM mission, which will constitute a
good opportunity to closely work with the IMF, deepening our dialogue and promoting a
closer mutual understanding.
