STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2013 ARTICLE IV CONSULTATION
AND FIRST POST-PROGRAM MONITORING

KEY ISSUES
Context: Weak external demand and inconsistent macroeconomic policies have
contributed to a prolonged economic recession. A combination of an effectively pegged
exchange rate, loose fiscal policy, and sizable quasi-fiscal losses in the energy sector has
pushed the fiscal and external current account deficits to very high levels. A gradual
depletion of international reserves and other buffers is making the economy particularly
vulnerable to external shocks.
Outlook and risks: A modest economic recovery should commence in late 2013.
However, a difficult business climate and impaired external competitiveness are
weighing on the medium-term outlook. The current policy mix is not sustainable as it
generates large imbalances and depresses growth. The risk of a costly market-forced
adjustment is high.
Main policy recommendations:
 Allow the exchange rate to adjust to its equilibrium level and increase its flexibility.
Accelerate preparations for the introduction of inflation targeting.
 Strengthen the financial system’s resilience to shocks, including by developing
comprehensive contingency plans to cover potential capital and liquidity shortfalls under
various scenarios.
 Curtail the fiscal deficit through a reform-based current expenditure consolidation and
the cancelation of unaffordable tax cuts.
 Reduce the quasi-fiscal losses in the energy sector by increasing the very low household
gas and heating tariffs in the context of a comprehensive energy sector reform plan,
while protecting the most vulnerable households.
 Launch broad structural and governance reforms to improve the business climate and
boost sustainable growth.

CONTEXT
1.
Incomplete transition to a market economy holds back Ukraine’s economy. While
significant progress has been made in establishing basic markets and reducing poverty, extensive
state presence in the economy––a large state

difficult by local and foreign businesses alike.
2.
Inconsistent macroeconomic policies generate deep-seated vulnerabilities and
recurrent crises. Ukraine has long relied on an effectively pegged exchange rate as a nominal
anchor, accompanied by loose fiscal policy and sizable quasi-fiscal losses ultimately covered by the
budget (and monetized by the NBU, which holds over 60 percent of domestic government debt).
This policy mix results in an overvalued exchange rate, large twin deficits, a steady rise in
indebtedness, recurrent difficulties with external financing, and low international reserves. Such
vulnerabilities make the economy especially susceptible to external shocks and balance of payments
crises, as in 1998 and 2008–09.
3.
Political polarization, the upcoming presidential elections, and pressures from vested
interests limit the authorities’ policy space. The ruling coalition led by the Party of Regions
remains in power after the parliamentary elections in October 2012. The majority and the opposition
have cooperated in passing legislation necessary for concluding the association agreement with the
EU. However, the unexpected government decision to suspend preparations for signing the
agreement as planned on November 29 prompted large-scale mass protests not seen since 2004.
Tensions remain high and may increase further in the run-up to the presidential elections in
March 2015. Vested interests, notably in the energy sector, continue to act as a drag on needed
reforms.

RECENT DEVELOPMENTS
4.
The economy has been in recession since mid-2012. Although a 15 percent budget wage
hike in 2012 boosted private consumption, weak external demand and falling investment dragged
activity down after the positive effects of co-hosting the Euro 2012 Soccer Cup had dissipated (chart
below). GDP contracted by 1.3 percent y-o-y in January–September 2013, but unemployment
remains below its long-term average at 7.5 percent in mid-2013 (Figure 2). Consumer prices stayed

flat in 2013 (Figure 3), held down by falling food prices and tight monetary policy. The 12-month
rolling current account deficit was 8 percent of GDP by end-September 2013, essentially unchanged
from end-2012 despite the 22 percent reduction in natural gas imports in January–September 2013
(Figure 4).

Tight monetary policy has stemmed pressures on the foreign exchange market. In
late 2012, devaluation expectations rose and demand for foreign currency spiked. Defending the
exchange rate, the NBU intervened heavily,

Private balance sheets have maintained their
moderate short foreign currency position since end-2012, with both loans and deposits in foreign
exchange stagnating. In an attempt to relax monetary conditions while safeguarding reserves, the
NBU lowered its main policy rate from 7.5 percent to 6.5 percent over the summer but raised the
reserve requirements on foreign currency deposits by several percentage points.
6.
Ukraine’s market access has become much more difficult and international reserves
are running low. In two Eurobond issues in early 2013, Ukraine raised US$2.25 billion at yields of
about 7½ percent. Since late May, yields have hovered in the 8½–15 percent range. This led the
INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

5

UKRAINE

authorities to postpone further Eurobond issuance, while tapping domestic banks and NBU’s
international reserves for financing in foreign currencies. The recent downgrades of the sovereign by
Moody’s to Caa1 and S&P and Fitch to B- led to renewed spikes in the bond and CDS spreads
(Figure 4); the bond yield curve inverted. By end-October, reserves fell to about 2.5 months of
imports and 36 percent of debt service in 2014. Meanwhile, foreign banks have continued to reduce
their exposure to Ukraine, but this has been more than offset in 2013 by asset repatriation by
domestic banks to purchase government US$-denominated bonds.
7.
The fiscal stance loosened in 2012, contributing to the buildup of vulnerabilities. Large
pension and wage increases, generous energy subsidies, and soccer cup spending led to a widening
of the general government deficit to 4½ percent of GDP in 2012, an expansion of 1½ percent of
GDP in structural terms. The combined structural deficit of the government and the state-owned
company Naftogaz, a perennial source of quasi-fiscal losses, rose to 6¾ percent.
8.
To cope with fiscal pressures, the authorities have been increasingly resorting to offbalance sheet activity, non-cash settlements, and low quality measures. As rising wage and
entitlement spending squeezes the budget, the authorities are trying to buoy public investment by
extending large amounts of state guarantees. In 2012, the guarantees exceeded 5 percent of GDP,
and could reach up to 3.5 percent of GDP in 2013 according to the budget law, although only about
0.7 percent of GDP has been allocated by end-October. In October, the parliament approved the use
of the so-called promissory notes (government IOUs) for about 1¼ percent of GDP for repayment of
overdue VAT refunds and expenditure arrears. The notes would be accepted as payments to
Naftogaz. Finally, as budget revenue has been falling short of expectations, the central government
has cut transfers to local governments and postponed low-priority budget spending.
9.
Energy-related quasi-fiscal losses are mounting and large contingent liabilities may be
looming. Despite lower gas imports, Naftogaz’s losses in 2013:H1 more than doubled. The losses
are generated by very low prices on sales to households and district heating companies and
declining share of sales to the profitable commercial enterprise market. Naftogaz’ shortage of funds
has also led to delays in paying for gas imports despite restructuring of a US$2 billion loan from
Russia’s Gazprombank. As reduced imports defy the “take-or-pay” terms of its contract, Gazprom
has announced an US$7 billion claim on Naftogaz for 2012, but has not taken legal steps to collect.
10.
Ukraine’s future trade and economic relations with the EU and Russia are unclear. In
August–October 2013, the Ukrainian authorities intensified their efforts to meet the conditions for
signing an association and free trade agreement with the EU. In this context, Russia’s authorities
announced that a free trade agreement with the EU would preclude Ukraine from participating in
the regional Customs Union (including Russia, Belarus, and Kazakhstan). The Ukrainian authorities
and businesses report that since August 2013, Russia’s authorities have been tightening customs
procedures and controls for Ukrainian exports. Moreover, Russian officials have stated that to
prevent re-export of EU goods to the Customs Union, the current essentially free trade regime with
Ukraine may revert to WTO’s most favored nation status should Ukraine sign a free trade agreement
with the EU. On November 21, the Ukrainian authorities unexpectedly suspended preparations for
signing the agreement with the EU citing the need to sort out trade and economic relations with
6

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

UKRAINE

Russia and the Customs Union first and calling for trilateral discussions between Ukraine, the EU,
and Russia on the matter. As of the time of issuance of the staff report, the authorities’ further
intentions regarding economic relations with the EU and Russia remain unclear.
11.
Meanwhile, the technical discussions on a possible new Fund-supported program
continue. When the program supported by an SBA expired in December 2012 (Box 1), the
authorities expressed their interest in a new arrangement with the Fund. Two missions visited Kyiv in
early 2013, but the authorities were not able to commit to a set of policies that would adequately
deal with Ukraine’s deep-seated problems. In the context of the 2013 Article IV consultations, the
authorities re-affirmed their interest in an arrangement with the Fund. Technical discussions with
staff are ongoing to ensure that policy commitments are sufficient to address Ukraine’s challenges.
Box 1. Ukraine: Stand-By Arrangements in 2008–12
In November 2008, the Executive Board approved a two-year, SDR 11 billion SBA with Ukraine (802 percent
of quota). The primary objectives of the SBA-supported program were macroeconomic stabilization and
adjustment amid the heavy impact of the global economic crisis of 2008–09. The program mitigated the
effects of the steep currency devaluation in late 2008, while still allowing the exchange rate to find its
market-driven equilibrium that dramatically improved the external position of the country. The program also
helped stabilize the banking system and created preconditions for economic recovery. However, little
ownership and insufficiently strong policy implementation amid political turmoil prevented tackling
fundamental structural and institutional weaknesses of the country (IMF Country Report 11/325). Under that
arrangement, two reviews were completed and SDR 7 billion disbursed before it went off track and was
cancelled in mid-2010 upon the approval of the next arrangement.
In July 2010, the Executive Board approved a 29-month, SDR 10 billion (729 percent of quota) SBA. This SBAsupported program aimed to set public finances on a sustainable path, eliminate quasi-fiscal losses in the
energy sector, facilitate transition to a flexible exchange rate regime, and further strengthen the financial
sector. Its main achievements included a pension reform in 2011, initial energy tariff adjustments, and
restoring international market access for Ukraine. Again, the authorities’ program policy ownership waned,
particularly in the key areas of energy tariff adjustment and exchange rate flexibility, and only one review
was successfully completed. Two purchases totaling SDR 2.25 billion were made before the program went
off track in 2011 and expired in December 2012.

EXTERNAL STABILITY ASSESSMENT
12.
Competitiveness is weak and the REER overvalued (Annex I). High real wage growth
amid slow productivity rise has eroded the gains from the 2009 devaluation, and the real exchange
rate remains significantly misaligned (by 14–16 percent). Economy-wide unit labor costs and the
ULC-based REER have exceeded their high 2008 levels. Staff estimates indicate that even if fiscal
policy gaps were closed while maintaining the current exchange rate level, the need for a significant
devaluation would persist.
13.
Large gross financing needs pose substantial risks. Debt rollover risks are high with
external debt above 75 percent of GDP and a gross external financing requirement of 37 percent of
GDP in 2014 (Table 4). The rollover risks are mitigated to some extent by the fact that a large portion

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

7

UKRAINE

of the debt represents significant inter-company lending and transfer pricing operations. The NBU’s
international reserves are low against several common metrics (Annex I).

OUTLOOK AND RISKS
14.
A pick up in agriculture and rising external demand in partner countries should
support a modest recovery from late 2013 on. The good agriculture performance will likely lead
to an exit from the recession in 2013:Q4. However, GDP would still decline by ¼ percent in 2013 as
weak industrial production and construction will outweigh the output boost from agriculture. Under
currently planned policies, a modest growth of about 1 percent is expected in 2014, driven by
improvements in external demand, strong grain exports, and continuing consumption expansion,
while saving and investment would decline further. After hovering around zero in 2013, inflation
would modestly rise to about 2 percent in 2014. The current account deficit would remain elevated
above 8 percent of GDP in 2013–14, as the pick-up in demand would largely offset the export boost.
15.
However, the current policy mix would sustain large imbalances and depress growth.
An overvalued exchange rate and large fiscal and quasi-fiscal deficits would keep the current
account deficit above 7 percent of GDP over the medium term, well above its estimated equilibrium
level (Annex I). Even assuming that external financing remains at historical levels, which cannot be
guaranteed, the depletion of the NBU’s international reserves will continue unabated (Table 3).
Remaining buffers and sporadic financing opportunities could allow maintaining stability for a while,
but they would not be able to prevent an eventual market-forced adjustment if current policies
remain in place. Meanwhile, the tight monetary policy in support of the exchange rate would keep
constraining private investment, while public investment would be further displaced by high wage
and pension spending. High labor costs relative to productivity would limit employment growth.
Together with the difficult business climate, these factors would keep actual and potential growth
depressed.
16.
The risk of a costly market-forced adjustment is high. The decline in international
reserves could trigger a run for foreign exchange, leading to a disruptive exchange rate shock that
would compress demand, raise inflation, and hit banks. This risk could be exacerbated by
(i) sustained loss of market access caused by the ongoing reappraisal of emerging market risk and
Ukraine’s deteriorating fundamentals; (ii) a more restrictive trade regime with Russia that could lead
to sizable export losses; and/or (iii) loss of confidence in government policies as their focus
alternates between integration with the EU and Russia.1 Other global and local risks cloud the
outlook as well (Annex II). On the upside, the possible––if postponed––signing of an association
agreement with the EU could help exports and spur FDI over time, with potential gains magnified
once competitiveness and the business climate are significantly improved.

Russia accounts for about ¼ of Ukrainian exports, mainly base metals and machinery. Most of these exports are
now exempt from customs duties under CIS and bilateral agreements.

REPORT ON DISCUSSIONS
A. The Policy Mix and Medium-Term Outlook
17.
In discussion with authorities, staff highlighted the deep economic problems
associated with the current policy mix and suggested an alternative. To maintain stability and
revive growth, staff advised a decisive and comprehensive policy turnaround: (i) allow the exchange
rate to adjust, eliminating overvaluation, and increase its flexibility; (ii) strengthen the financial
system’s resilience to shocks, including by developing comprehensive contingency plans to cover
potential capital and liquidity shortfalls under various scenarios; (iii) launch fiscal consolidation to
support the external adjustment and reduce financing risks; (iv) raise energy tariffs as part of a
comprehensive plan to reduce quasi-fiscal losses, and (v) persevere with deep structural reforms to
improve the business climate and raise growth. Several of these recommendations were already
discussed during the 2012 Article IV consultation (Box 2).

The adjustment scenario outlined by staff would substantially reduce Ukraine’s
vulnerabilities and help revive growth (Table 7 and Figure 8). The exchange rate adjustment

Box 2. Ukraine: 2012 Article IV Consultation: Key Recommendations and Actions Taken
A year ago, Article IV discussion centered on policies to: (i) secure sound public finances; (ii) strengthen the
finances of the energy sector; (iii) reduce financial vulnerabilities and revive lending; (iv) enhance the
effectiveness of monetary policy; and (v) facilitate higher, sustainable medium-term growth. Progress in
implementing staff’s advice in most of these areas has been slow.

10



Fiscal recommendations. Meeting the 1.8 percent of GDP deficit target in 2012 required immediate
adoption of measures to (i) raise tax rates and eliminate exemptions; (ii) remove special tax
treatment of offshore tax havens; (iii) cut current spending; and (iv) apply strict limits on state
guarantees.



Progress: Some progress has been achieved in closing transfer pricing tax loopholes, amending the
tax treaty with Cyprus to raise some taxes, and automating VAT refunds. However, the general
government deficit reached 4.5 percent of GDP in 2012, and government guarantees exceeded
5 percent of GDP.



Energy sector recommendations. Raise household gas and heating tariffs (mitigated by bettertargeted social assistance) and articulate a broader energy sector reform strategy.



Progress: The tariffs remained essentially unchanged, and energy reforms have been very slow to
progress.



Monetary/exchange rate recommendations. Increase exchange rate flexibility. Gradually unwind
crisis-era policies, including Resolution 109 that forced banks to hold negative open foreign
exchange positions.



Progress: NBU continued defending the effective exchange rate peg, and the official exchange rate
UAH/US$ remained fixed. Unwinding Resolution 109 was limited to a pilot project that allowed
several banks to include government foreign exchange-linked bonds in the calculation of the net
open foreign exchange position.



Financial sector recommendations. Staff urged a review of contingency plans, strengthened
monitoring, and creation of a dedicated financial stability unit, as well as close supervision of banks
to ensure compliance with prudential norms.



Progress: Reported financial stability indicators point to gradual strengthening of the financial
system. With the help of IMF technical assistance, financial stability unit in the NBU has been
created and become operational.



Structural reform recommendations. Reforms to promote growth, improve the business climate, and
attract investment, including global integration, deregulation, stronger governance, and
privatization.



Progress: Reforms allowed Ukraine to advance in the World Bank’s Doing Business international
competitiveness ranking, but business people report that the business climate remains very
challenging, as evidenced by declining domestic investments and FDI. Governance issues persist,
particularly in public procurement and the opaque energy sector.

19.
Authorities’ views. The authorities recognized the risks and agreed in principle that
corrections to current policies are needed. They are currently elaborating policy adjustments in
several areas. However, their assessment of the degree and speed of the necessary changes in
monetary, fiscal, and energy policies differed from staff’s views. To minimize the reforms’ adjustment
costs, the authorities preferred a gradual approach in the context of a comprehensive
macroeconomic adjustment program, preferably supported by a financial arrangement with the
Fund. They also saw the economic outlook more positively, emphasizing the positive impact of the
good grain harvest on output and exports.

B. Moving Towards a Sustainable Exchange Rate Regime and Monetary
Framework
20.
Allowing the exchange rate to adjust to its equilibrium level and increasing its
flexibility thereafter is necessary for a sustainable correction of external imbalances. Staff
considers it essential to allow the exchange rate to move to the level that would correct the
estimated real overvaluation––taking into account the adjustment’s own effect on inflation––and
enable the NBU to replenish its international reserves through market purchases. This adjustment
should be accompanied by the introduction of a wide band around the new parity, within which the
exchange rate should be allowed to float freely. With confidence in the new regime and the NBU’s
ability to control inflation rising over time, the exchange rate band could be widened further and
eventually abandoned with the formal introduction of inflation targeting (¶23).
21.
The exchange rate adjustment should be accompanied by tight policies to contain
inflation. As inflation is currently near zero, it would remain manageable after the adjustment. Tight
monetary policy, conducted through strict limits on the NBU’s NDA––while allowing adequate
liquidity provision to banks early on––and positive policy interest rates in real terms will help contain
the second round effects on private wages and inflation expectations. Tight fiscal policy (discussed
below) will support monetary policy.
22.
Staff advised against extensive use of administrative foreign exchange controls as a
substitute for the needed policy adjustment. To prop the overvalued exchange rate, Ukraine
already uses various administrative measures designed to limit demand for foreign exchange and
increase its supply, and has tended to intensify such measures at times of market tensions.2
However, they are costly for the economy and may be counterproductive if they thwart vital intercompany lending and diminish policy credibility. Staff advised the authorities not to intensify
existing controls and begin to dismantle them gradually once a package of adjustment policies is in
place. Staff also advised the NBU to eliminate the two remaining multiple currency practices
described in the Informational Annex.
2

Exporters are subject to a 50 percent surrender requirement on their earnings. Recently, the NBU extended the
surrender requirement to a broader range of transactions. Conversion in hryvnia is required for all foreign exchange
transfers from abroad to persons when the amount exceeds UAH 150,000 a month. A license is required for some
foreign exchange transactions, including investment abroad.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

23.
Moving to a flexible exchange rate regime would require significant changes in the
NBU monetary policy framework and eventual adoption of inflation targeting (IT). Staff has
long recommended IT as the most suitable monetary policy framework for Ukraine given the NBU’s
mandate to focus on price stability and the need to have an anchor under a flexible exchange rate.
The NBU has made good technical progress in preparations for switching to IT. They have narrowed
the interest rate corridor between their deposit and lending facilities and introduced an automatic
overnight deposit facility, as recommended by Fund staff. Alongside, the authorities have been
building up capacities for macroeconomic modeling and inflation forecasting. Staff assesses that
once the high-level commitment to adopt the new framework is made, it could become operational
within 12–18 months. To facilitate the transition, staff recommended enhancing further the tools for
managing short-term interest rates and allowing banks additional flexibility in managing their
liquidity (Annex V). The new tools would strengthen the interest rate-based monetary policy
transmission via the interbank money market in preparation for transitioning away from exchange
rate and money anchors.
24.
Authorities’ views. The NBU was in favor of gradually increasing exchange rate flexibility.
However, they expressed concern about possible market disruptions following the switch to the new
regime, and preferred to do so as part of a comprehensive adjustment program. Moreover, the NBU
considered that a modest exchange rate move would be sufficient to reduce the current account
deficit to a sustainable level, which they viewed to be about 5–6 percent of GDP. At the same time,
the NBU stressed the importance of foreign exchange controls for maintaining steady supply of
foreign exchange to the market and discouraging speculative pressures on the exchange rate in the
current difficult situation. Staff noted that a current account deficit of 5–6 percent of GDP would
keep international reserves declining as external financing necessary to cover such a deficit has not
been available to Ukraine since 2010 (Table 3). Even if such financing were to appear, the already
high external liabilities would keep rising fast, and reserve coverage of debt would remain
precariously low. The NBU agreed with the benefits of a monetary policy framework based on
interest rate management, and with a gradual transition to IT in the medium term.

C. Maintaining Financial Stability
25.
The banking system appears stable at present, but vulnerabilities persist. The
authorities have steered the economy through domestic market tensions at the end of 2012, and
confidence in the banking system has improved. A high average capital adequacy ratio of 18 percent
provides some cushion against risks stemming from an elevated NPL ratio of 14 percent (Table 6).3
The NPLs are relatively well provisioned, with specific provisions covering 81 percent of impaired
loans and 45 percent of doubtful loans, but the market value and liquidity of posted collateral are
difficult to verify, and regulatory and tax impediments keep NPL resolution slow. At the same time,
the NBU’s Resolution 109 continues to force the banking sector into a large negative foreign

3

Including substandard loans in the definition of NPLs, in line with the best international practice, would raise the
NPL ratio to over 25 percent.

12

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

UKRAINE

exchange position of about 20 percent of capital by end-September 2013.4 Though significantly
reduced since end-2012, this exposure still keeps banks vulnerable to a large exchange rate move.
Moreover, banks’ uncertainty about the macroeconomic outlook and access to NBU liquidity
facilities forces them to seek liquidity by maintaining high deposit rates, with the resulting high
lending rates limiting demand for credit. This constrains economic growth and limits banks’ ability to
further build capital buffers out of their profits.
26.
Staff proposed to unwind Resolution 109 in a balanced way that reduces bank
vulnerabilities without destabilizing the foreign exchange market. Allowing the provisions
against foreign currency loans back in the calculation of the foreign currency position over three
years would generate only modest additional bank demand for foreign exchange and thus strike the
right balance in this respect. To improve the banks’ foreign exchange position while also reducing
their exposure to foreign exchange risk during the transition, staff recommended allowing all banks
to include government exchange rate-indexed securities in the calculation of foreign currency
assets. Further limited issuance of such securities will help as well, as it would help mitigate the
impact of exchange rate devaluation on the banks at the expense of only minor additional cost for
the government. Alongside, staff advised removing the remaining tax, administrative, and legal
obstacles that prevent NPL resolution and corporate debt restructuring, such as the need to pay VAT
when selling NPLs and the lack of out-of-court procedure to settle insolvency between defaulting
borrowers and the involved banks.
27.
Authorities’ views. The NBU agreed to repeal Resolution 109 and gradually phase out its
restrictions in three years, but wanted to start the process as part of a comprehensive adjustment
program. Meanwhile, the NBU envisaged expanding the pilot project allowing banks to count
government exchange rate-indexed securities as foreign currency assets and including provisions in
foreign currencies up to the amount of the indexed bonds in the calculation of the foreign exchange
position. Staff cautioned that while such securities do cushion the effect of an exchange rate move
on banks’ balance sheets, this approach is not international best practice, as the indexed bonds
cannot cover losses caused by possible write-offs of foreign currency loans. The NBU has set up a
working group with representatives of relevant government agencies to identify impediments to
NPL resolution and making recommendations for their removal.
28.
Even as the banking system appears capable of withstanding significant shocks, staff
advised developing contingency and recovery plans. Stress tests conducted by staff suggest that
even in case of significant––but still orderly––exchange rate depreciation, banks’ capital and liquidity
needs will remain manageable.5 Nevertheless, detailed contingency plans focused on keeping
4

NBU’s Resolution 109 excludes provisions in foreign currencies from the calculation of banks’ foreign exchange
position. This artificially reduces banks’ foreign currency liabilities and forces the banks to keep their foreign currency
assets low in order to comply with the NBU regulation on open foreign exchange positions. However, this policy
amounts to requiring the banks to run a structural negative (short) economic open position, as their foreign
exchange assets fall well short of their foreign exchange liabilities inclusive of provisions in foreign currencies.
5

For example, stress tests on groups of banks covering credit and foreign exchange risks based on data for
September 2013 indicate that a significant but orderly devaluation and the concomitant rise in NPLs would reduce
bank capital by 2¼–4 percent of GDP. This would not generate recapitalization needs for most banks given existing

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

systemic banks sufficiently capitalized and the whole system liquid should help mitigate the impact
of adverse shocks. The mission also recommended that systemically important banks be required to
prepare recovery plans and the NBU, in coordination with the Deposit Guarantee Fund and the
Ministry of Finance, develop specific resolution plans for the most vulnerable banks to be used in
case of need. To dispel possible doubts about the strength of banks’ balance sheets and their
adherence to reporting standards, staff advised the NBU to launch independent diagnostic audits of
vulnerable systemic banks, focusing on asset quality, loan classification, provisioning, adequacy of
loan collateral, and related party lending.
29.
Authorities’ views. The NBU agreed that the banking system can withstand mild shocks,
but argued––on the basis of stress tests with extremely strong assumptions––that exchange rate
moves of the magnitude implied by staff’s advice would generate very large capital needs. Staff
acknowledged the need to be conservative when running stress tests, but noted that the NBU’s
assumptions appear extreme in view of the macroeconomic situation expected to prevail after
adjustment policies are put in place (Table 7) and international best practice. The NBU shared the
view that independent audits of vulnerable systemic private banks would be useful, and––in
cooperation with Fund and World Bank staff––has developed terms of reference for such audits and
made other preparatory steps. Staff pointed out that the audits should go ahead as soon as
possible, as they could provide useful input in the contingency and recovery plans mentioned
above.
30.
Enhancing bank supervision and strengthening reporting standards should help reveal
and address banking sector vulnerabilities. Despite improvement in banking supervision,
significant weakness remain particularly regarding identification of true owners of banks, the sources
of funding, and monitoring of connected lending and large exposures on consolidated basis. While
the NBU appears to have the adequate authority and rules for consolidated supervision, its
enforcement could be much more effective with more assertive supervisory regime. Staff
encouraged the NBU to strengthen its financial stability and supervisory functions by prompt
enforcement of consolidated bank supervision and improving their early warning system to ensure
timely detection of problem banks and subject them to enhanced supervision. Staff also advised an
acceleration of the process of resolving the three intervened banks in state possession, which is
moving slowly.
31.
Authorities’ views. The NBU has adopted a new regulation for consolidation supervision
and is working on making it fully operational. They pointed out the significant progress in
transforming Rodovid (one of the three intervened banks) into a bad bank that would accept NPLs
from the other two (Kiev bank and Ukrgaz bank). Currently they are in the process of selecting
financial advisor to recommend how to dispose (through sale or merger) of Kiev bank and Ukrgaz
bank.

high capital buffers. Nevertheless, a few large banks would need to raise their capital somewhat in order to reach the
minimum 10 percent capital adequacy ratio.

D. Launching Fiscal Consolidation to Support the Adjustment
32.
Under current policies, the combined general government-Naftogaz deficit is
projected to rise sharply in 2013 and remain elevated in 2014. Staff projects the budget deficit
at 5¾ percent of GDP in 2013, including 1¼ percent of GDP in recognized tax refund and
expenditure arrears to be covered by promissory notes (Table 2). The combined general
government-Naftogaz deficit will expand to 7¾ percent of GDP in 2013. The large tax cuts currently
envisaged in the tax code would have further raised the combined deficit to 8½ percent of GDP
in 2014, had the authorities not decided to reconsider them (see below).6
33.
While the current level of public debt is still moderate, it is projected to rise further
and is subject to considerable risks. Under the baseline, public debt is projected to exceed
40 percent of GDP in 2013 and approach 60 percent of GDP in the medium term (Annex III).
Substantial gross external financing requirements would expose Ukraine to significant rollover and
exchange rate risks. Large contingent liabilities generated by generous use of government
guarantees, promissory notes, and Naftogaz’s actual and potential obligations present substantial
risks as well.
34.
Staff urged the authorities to embark on fiscal consolidation as part of the adjustment
package. To support the external adjustment and stave off the acute financing risks (Annex VI), staff
recommended a general government deficit target of 2¾ percent of GDP in 2014, falling to
1¾ percent of GDP in the medium term (text table). Including the effects of the energy sector

vulnerability. In the short term, the fiscal consolidation will exert an inevitable but moderate drag on
domestic demand and growth, partly offset by the boost in net exports. In the medium term, the
moderate deficit would stop crowding out bank lending to the economy, reduce pressures on the
NBU balance sheet, and help stabilize public debt below the generally accepted for emerging
markets benchmark of 40 percent of GDP, opening fiscal space for countercyclical policies.
35.
The brunt of the fiscal consolidation should fall on reducing current expenditure.
In 2014, high budget expenditure (about 50 percent of GDP) should be reduced by rationalizing
public procurement, reducing subsidies, restraining public sector wages and hiring, and indexing
pensions only with inflation, removing the recently introduced wage-linked indexation component.
These policies will begin reversing the unaffordable wage and pension hikes of previous years. Over
the medium term, staff recommended current expenditure cuts of some 6¾ percent of GDP through
continuing wage and employment restraint, pension reforms with a focus on privileged pensions,
and deeper subsidy cuts made feasible by the energy sector reform (Annex VII). This will return
current expenditure just below its 2011 level and allow doubling capital outlays to 3 percent of
GDP––the minimum necessary to maintain public infrastructure.
36.
Staff strongly cautioned against unaffordable and untimely tax cuts and distortionary
substitutions. The authorities were considering proposing to parliament to postpone the scheduled
cuts in the VAT and CIT from 2014 to 2016. Staff argued that any tax cuts should be postponed until
the needed adjustment in current expenditure was well under way and the budget deficit reduced to
a sustainable level. Once this is done, tax cuts that best support growth should be given priority. On
this basis, staff supported the intention to postpone the cut in the CIT rate to 2016, but advised
abandoning altogether the plan to cut the VAT rate, as this is unlikely to be affordable given the
need to reduce the budget deficit. Staff also advised against the contemplated re-introduction of a
tax on non-cash foreign exchange purchases, abolished in 2011 due to its distortionary impact on
financial intermediation. Instead, staff recommended phasing out existing VAT exemptions,
especially in agriculture, and supported plans for a five-year schedule for raising excise taxes,
starting in 2014. The recent revision of Ukraine’s tax treaty with Cyprus and the introduction of a law
on transfer pricing have some revenue-raising potential, although estimated gains seem optimistic.
37.
Staff cautioned against the use of promissory notes to settle arrears. Staff welcomed
recognition of existing arrears, but stressed that these should be settled through conventional
methods such as cash payments and netting the due refunds against VAT liabilities. Staffs
emphasized that the issuance of promissory notes to clear arrears would undermine future budget
and Naftogaz revenue and impose deep haircuts on legitimate business receivables.
38.
Authorities’ views. The authorities broadly agreed with the need to frontload fiscal
consolidation and reduce the general government deficit below 3 percent in 2014, but were yet in
the process of shaping key policies to achieve that. They argued for a consolidation strategy based
on a combination of expenditure and revenue measures. Given the large and highly rigid social
component of total expenditures––which they found hard to change––the authorities considered
the amount of proposed medium-term current expenditure consolidation difficult to implement. On
tax issues, the authorities agreed that the scheduled cuts in VAT and CIT rates may adversely affect
16

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

UKRAINE

macroeconomic stability in 2014, and committed to proposing to parliament their postponement
until 2016. At the same time, they argued that the reduction in VAT rate may help reduce the
shadow economy and should not be abandoned altogether. The authorities also acknowledged that
reducing tax exemptions to the agricultural sector was long overdue and could generate large
savings, but highlighted political difficulties associated with this reform. The authorities emphasized
that the acceptance of promissory notes will be voluntary and agreed to settle obligations in cash
should there be no demand for such notes.
39.
Staff emphasized the importance of reforms to modernize the institutional framework
of fiscal policy and limit accumulation of fiscal risks. These reforms would support
macroeconomic stability following the adjustment and should include: (i) a fiscal rule to anchor the
budget deficit consistent with medium-term macroeconomic stability; (ii) a medium-term budget
framework with binding expenditure ceilings supporting the authorities’ policy objectives; and (iii) a
rigorous and transparent process for selecting public investment projects—both on-budget and
state-guaranteed––with the highest economic rate of return. In this regard, staff recommended
limiting state guarantees to 1 percent of GDP per year to stem the rapid buildup of contingent
liabilities and consequent upward pressures on government borrowing costs.
40.
Authorities’ views. The authorities felt that state guarantees were important to attract longterm investments to the economy. They explained that the recently created special committee to
oversee investment projects seeking support through state guarantees has strengthened the project
selection mechanism to minimize contingent liability risks. However, they noted practical difficulties
associated with the adoption of a medium-term budget framework given large uncertainties about
the macroeconomic outlook.

E. Reducing Quasi-Fiscal Losses and Raising Growth with Energy Sector
Reforms
41.
An inefficient and opaque energy sector is weighing on public finances and the
economy. Overall energy subsidies in Ukraine, on- and off-budget, are estimated at 7½ percent of
GDP in 2012 with relatively well-off households capturing the larger share of the benefits. The very
low tariffs for residential gas and district heating (20–30 percent of economic costs)––the main
factors behind the high subsidies––encourage one of the highest energy consumption levels in
Europe and lead to large quasi-fiscal losses by Naftogaz. They also exacerbate balance of payment
weaknesses, discourage investment in domestic production, and breed governance problems.
42.
A large body of analytical work has prepared the ground for reform. Studies by
Ukrainian and IFI (mainly World Bank) experts have brought clarity about the size and distribution of
existing subsidies, developed proposals how to mitigate the impact of subsidy removal on the most
vulnerable, and suggested means of effective communication of the need for reform to various

stakeholders. International experience suggests that these are the prerequisites for a successful

43.
An ambitious and comprehensive energy sector reform, focused on eliminating
Naftogaz’s operational losses, is an indispensable part of the macroeconomic adjustment
package. Such a reform will reduce quasi-fiscal losses and budget subsidies, help in reining in the
current account deficit, secure funds for domestic investment to achieve energy independence—a
key medium-term objective of the authorities—and alleviate governance problems in the sector.
Staff argued that the reform should aim at gradually eliminating Naftogaz’s operational losses over
the medium term, limiting its deficit to the interest paid on its debt. For 2014, staff supported the
authorities’ intention to cut Naftogaz’s deficit to 1¼ percent of GDP and urged the adoption of
credible policies to this end.
44.
The reform should be based on a schedule of gradual, but upfront, meaningful, and
broad-based tariff increases. Staff stressed that given the current very low tariffs, it would
necessarily take a few years to reach full economic cost recovery. That said, the low initial position
and the impact of the expected exchange rate adjustment on the cost of gas imports makes it
imperative to start with meaningful gas and heating tariff increases for a broad household customer
base in 2014 as also advised by the World Bank. This approach would strike the right balance
between decisively moving toward cost recovery while minimizing collection problems along the
7

IMF Policy Paper “Energy Subsidy Reform: Lessons and Implications,” January 2013.

18

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

UKRAINE

way. Moreover, such policy would help reduce Naftogaz’s deficit and enable cuts of budget
subsidies already in 2014, as well as strengthen incentives to save energy. Also, it would improve
governance in the energy sector by reducing arbitrage opportunities for gas and heat sales––long
exploited by vested interests––created by the existing tariff differentials across customer categories.
To offset the effect of tariff adjustment on the most vulnerable and facilitate social acceptance of
the reform, staff advised increasing targeted social assistance to the poorest 40 percent of
households by expanding the existing means-tested programs (Annex VIII).
45.
Tariff adjustment would work best as part of a comprehensive energy sector reform
plan to reduce the use and cost of energy and raise domestic gas output. To this end, staff
advised: (i) accelerating gas and heat metering and energy saving efforts, to complement the
indispensable tariff hikes; (ii) diversifying gas imports toward cheaper sources; and (iii) create
enabling environment––in terms of pricing and business climate––for attracting investment into
domestic gas production.
46.
Authorities’ views. The authorities agreed that the energy sector is in need of reforms on
multiple fronts, and announced their intention to cut Naftogaz’s deficit to 1¼ percent of GDP
in 2014. However, they are reluctant to raise current gas and heating tariffs, despite considering
options to this effect. In the heating sector, the authorities are working on a program to increase
energy efficiency and cost transparency of the housing, utilities, and public sectors. In parallel, plans
are being designed to convert in-kind energy benefits in cash by distributing voucher-like electronic
cards to eligible households. Meanwhile, the authorities are working on raising domestic gas
production from both conventional and unconventional sources and diversifying import sources, but
notable gains from both approaches are expected only in the medium term.

F. Boosting Sustainable Growth
47.
Advancing structural reforms and improving the business climate is imperative for
unlocking Ukraine’s growth potential. Progress in this area has been mixed, with improvements in
the area of starting a business, registering property, and paying taxes, but remaining inefficiencies in
institutional capacity and business regulations. The mixed record is reflected in competitiveness
ratings. On the one hand, Ukraine rapidly advanced in the 2014 Doing Business report (by 28 ranks
to 112th place out of 189 countries); on the other hand, it lost ground in the 2013–14 Global
Competitiveness Index. Staff welcomed the authorities’ efforts to improve the legal framework for
governance and business climate, but emphasized that the uneven implementation of laws and
regulations remains a drag on business activity, private investment, and technology transfer. As a
consequence, the productivity potential of the economy remains suppressed and competitiveness
and FDI inflows compare unfavorably against regional peers. Overall, most domestic business
persons and international observers agree that comprehensive and far-reaching improvements in
business climate and governance are needed to attract investment and support economic growth.
48.
Staff recommended a focus on structural reforms addressing the binding constraints
to growth, which are generally in the areas where Ukraine lags behind its regional peers
(Figure 7 and Annex IX). This includes strengthening the judicial system, simplifying or repealing

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

19

UKRAINE

burdensome government regulations, and stepping up anti-corruption measures. The authorities are
undertaking welcome measures to reduce excessive regulation, pass anti-corruption legislation, and
address judicial weaknesses as part of the work on the association agreement with the EU. These
efforts need to continue in a decisive and comprehensive manner, with equally strong emphasis put
on implementation and execution of law and regulations. In this regard, staff recommended:
(i) ensuring timely and fair resolution of commercial disputes by improving the efficiency and
governance in the judicial system; (ii) establishing an independent business ombudsman, as
recommended by a number of business organizations and IFIs, to respond to concerns about unfair
business practices and advocate swift action to resolve such concerns; (iii) strengthening
administrative, judicial and operational capacity to protect property rights; (iv) imposing clear and
consistent rules in tax administration and continuing to address delays in VAT refunds through
conventional measures; and (v) making the recently reformed corporate insolvency framework
operational. Decisive progress in these areas should raise productivity and private investment,
substantially lifting potential growth in the medium term.
49.
Staff recommends further strengthening the regulatory and operational framework
for anti-money laundering and combating financing of terrorism (AML/CFT). The assessment
done in 2009 by Moneyval, the regional body assessing compliance with AML/CFT standards,
revealed flaws in the Ukrainian legal framework, and the progress report submitted to Moneyval in
December 2012 confirmed that some of those flaws remained in place. In particular, there are
shortcomings in proper customer due diligence requirements on ultimate beneficial owners of legal
persons, which are crucial to detect potentially illicit funds. Furthermore, there is no explicit
requirement to check the source of wealth/funds of owners (including beneficial owners) of
qualifying holdings of banks. In this context, staff advised the NBU to expedite the work on draft
amendments to the AML/CFT law in line with FATF recommendations as well as ensure their prompt
adoption and implementation. In addition, staff recommended to the NBU to set up more specific
requirements to check the source of wealth/funds of the founders and owners of qualifying holdings
of banks, including beneficial owners.
50.
Authorities’ views. The authorities agreed with the need to further improve the business
climate and governance, and underscored that their reforms have significantly improved Ukraine’s
standing in the World Bank Doing Business report. They focus on an ambitious deregulation
process, as well as tax and custom administration reforms to create more business-friendly
environment, as provided for in the President’s Reform Program for 2010–14 and the Program to
Accelerate Economic Development for 2013–14. Regarding the AML/CFT agenda, the authorities are
in the process of incorporating the latest FATF requirements in their legislation and operational
regulations, and hope that their progress in this regard will be noted in the next assessment by
Moneyval now scheduled for May 2014.

20

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

UKRAINE

CAPACITY TO REPAY THE FUND
51.
Ukraine’s capacity to repay the Fund remains adequate, but risks are emerging. So far
all repurchases have been made in full and on schedule. On the obligation basis, outstanding Fund
credit to Ukraine would decline below 200 percent of quota by February 2014 and below
100 percent of quota by September 2014 (Table 9). However, declining reserves and difficulties in
obtaining external financing pose risks for the large repurchases in 2014 (SDR 2.4 billion) and 2015
(SDR 1 billion). Staff emphasized that resolute and comprehensive policy adjustments to correct
external imbalances and strengthen Ukraine’s external position would uphold Ukraine’s capacity to
repay the Fund and service its other liabilities as scheduled.
52.
The authorities have reaffirmed their commitment to repay the outstanding Fund
credit. They underlined that Ukraine has already made large repurchases of SDR 2.2 billion in 2012
and SDR 3.7 billion in 2013 that exceed the remaining amounts. Looking forward, the authorities
believed that their international reserves, prospective financing opportunities, and other available
buffers are sufficient to ensure the scheduled repurchases in 2014–15 that would extinguish all
outstanding Fund credit.

STAFF APPRAISAL
53.
The Ukrainian authorities maintained macroeconomic stability in 2012–13 amid
worsening external conditions and a recession. The authorities steered the economy through
market tensions at the end of 2012, and households’ precautionary demand for foreign exchange
has considerably eased since then. Confidence in the banking system has improved, and high capital
adequacy ratios provide a cushion against risks. Large negative foreign exchange positions have
been reduced, although further progress is needed. Naftogaz managed to reduce expensive gas
imports, which kept in check the external current account deficit despite the decline in exports. The
authorities began to close some tax loopholes with the passage of the law on transfer pricing and
amendments in the tax treaty with Cyprus.
54.
However, stability was maintained at a high economic price. The authorities’ policies to
maintain the effective exchange rate peg and raise public wages and pensions in 2012 led to large
twin deficits and depletion of international reserves. As access to external debt markets has become
more difficult in 2013, the government has increasingly resorted to the NBU and state-controlled
banks for financing the ballooning budget deficit. To calm the persistent devaluation expectations
and sterilize excess bank liquidity, the NBU maintained tight monetary policy stance and intensified
foreign exchange controls. This prompted banks to offer very high deposit rates, which moderated
households’ demand for foreign exchange, but also raised the cost of credit in the midst of the
recession. Ultimately, this policy mix contributed to deepening the recession in 2012–13.
55.
The current policy mix is not sustainable as it generates significant risks and depresses
growth. An overvalued exchange rate, large fiscal deficit, and sizable quasi-fiscal losses keep the
current account deficit well above equilibrium. Under unchanged policies, the NBU’s international
INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

21

reserves and other buffers will be further depleted during 2014, making the country particularly
vulnerable to disruptive shocks and raising the risk to repayments to the Fund. Rising risk perception
reflected in sovereign rating downgrades by all major rating agencies makes it much more difficult
for the sovereign and corporates to obtain external market financing, while domestic sources of
financing are limited. Tight monetary policy to support the exchange rate, low public investment,
and tough business climate keep growth depressed.
56.
To resolve macroeconomic imbalances and revive growth, the authorities would be
well advised to undertake resolute and comprehensive policy adjustments in several critical
areas. The needed adjustment package should aim to curtail the fiscal and external current account
deficits, phase out unaffordable and distortive energy subsidies, strengthen the banking sector, and
improve the external competitiveness of the economy. Staff presented its recommendations to the
authorities on the policy design in all critical areas. The authorities are now developing their own set
of policies aimed at achieving similar objectives.
57.
Allowing the exchange rate to adjust and eliminate overvaluation and shifting to a
new monetary policy framework is critical to correct external imbalances and avoid future
policy traps. A more flexible exchange rate responding to market forces would boost Ukraine’s
export performance and economic growth, especially in the face of volatile export prices and partner
country demand. It would also allow more room for independent monetary policy. In the medium
term, inflation targeting is the appropriate monetary framework for Ukraine, and preparations for its
introduction should be accelerated.
58.
Alongside, strengthening the banking system to increase its resilience to shocks would
widen the menu of policy options available to the authorities. Official data suggest that the
banking system is able to withstand a wide range of shocks. However, the NBU remains concerned
for its stability in case of a significant exchange rate move. The independent diagnostic audits
proposed by IMF and World Bank staff should help clear potential doubts about asset quality and
reporting standards in a number of systemic banks. Allowing all banks to reduce their negative
foreign exposure and removing impediments to NPL resolution would strengthen their balance
sheets. Alongside, contingency plans to keep systemic banks sufficiently capitalized and the whole
system liquid should help mitigate the impact of adverse shocks.
59.
A sizeable expenditure-reducing fiscal consolidation is needed to curtail the budget
deficit and make room for public investment. High budget expenditure should be reduced by
rationalizing public procurement, restraining public sector wages and employment, and limiting
pension indexation to inflation. Over the medium term, these policies will return current expenditure
broadly to its 2011 level and allow proper investment in public infrastructure. To anchor the fiscal
adjustment, the authorities could adopt a rule-based approach to setting the budget deficit targets
and spending limits over the medium term.
60.
A comprehensive energy sector reform, centered on upfront, meaningful, and broadbased tariff increases, is indispensable for the needed macroeconomic adjustment. Upfront gas
and heating tariff increases would strengthen incentives to save energy, reduce the budget transfers

22

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

UKRAINE

to Naftogaz, and enable cuts of budget subsidies. Also, they would incentivize domestic gas
production and improve governance in the energy sector by reducing arbitrage opportunities for
gas sales created by the existing tariff differentials. To offset the effect of tariff adjustment on the
most vulnerable, staff advises increasing targeted social assistance to the poorest 40 percent of
households. Welcome energy-saving reforms and import diversification toward cheaper sources
should complement, but not substitute for the indispensable tariff hikes.
61.
Improving the business climate is imperative for higher growth. Progress in this area
has been mixed. Reforms in several areas allowed Ukraine to advance considerably in the World
Bank’s Doing Business 2014 report. Still, the recorded progress did not always match the feedback
that staff received from business representatives regarding their operational environment. To raise
investment and promote growth, reforms should be accelerated to relax binding constraints on
growth, in particular in areas where Ukraine lags behind its regional peers.
62.
To fully realize its ample economic potential over the medium term, Ukraine needs
comprehensive macroeconomic adjustment and ambitious structural reforms. The growth
model based on public sector-driven expansion of domestic consumption has reached its limits. The
current policy mix and difficult business climate deter investment. And impaired competitiveness
weighs on exports. To remove these brakes on economic activity, the authorities will be well advised
to undertake resolute macroeconomic adjustment and decisive structural reforms. Ukraine indeed
has great potential. Agriculture has been developing well recently, but has much more room to
grow as Ukraine has some of the best arable land in Europe. With the right prices and investment
climate, production of natural gas could expand significantly over time. And Ukraine’s well-educated
labor force can substantially raise total factor productivity. Deeper integration with the EU could
help exports and spur FDI, with potential gains significantly magnified once competitiveness and the
business climate are improved. Sound policies can substantially raise actual and potential growth
over the medium term, with the concomitant boost in population’s living standards and general
well-being.
63.
It is proposed that the next Article IV Consultation with Ukraine be held on the
standard 12-month cycle.

1/ Consumer confidence index is based on survey respondents' answers to questions that relate to personal financial
standing, changes in personal financial standing, economic conditions over the next year, economic conditions over the next
five years, and propensity to consume. Index values range from 0 to 200. The index equals 200 when all respondents
positively assess the economic situation. It totals 100 when the shares of positive and negative assessments are equal. Indices
of less than 100 indicate the prevalence of negative assessments.
2/ Values above 100 indicate that more respondents expect unemployment to rise than fall over the next one to two
months. Values can vary from 0 to 200.

1/ Assumes gas import price of US$405 per tcm in 2013 and in line with global oil price developments beyond.
2/ Financing from World Bank, EU, and EBRD is recorded below the line.
3/ Includes trade credit and arrears, including those related to RUE settlement (2010 and 2011).
4/ Mainly reflects residents' conversion of hryvnia cash to foreign currency held outside the banking system.
5/ The IMF composite measure is calculated as a weighted sum of short-term debt, other portfolio liabilities, broad money, and exports in
percent of GDP, with different weights for "fixed" and "floating" exchange rate regime. Official reserves are recommended to be in the range of
100-150 percent of the appropriate measure.

Annex I. Ukraine: Competitiveness, Exchange Rate Assessment,
and Reserve Adequacy
Ukraine’s competitiveness has eroded, while cyclical and structural factors have led to
significant vulnerabilities. After a period of overvaluation (2004–08), which was mainly driven by
large inflation differentials vis-à-vis main trading partners, a forced nominal devaluation boosted
Ukraine’s competitiveness in 2009. Since then, unabated wage pressures—despite low inflation—
have led to high real wage growth. Meanwhile, productivity continued to grow at a much slower
pace relative to other CESEE countries, partly on account of poor quality capital stock and slower
technological advances. As a result, the ULC-based competitiveness indicator points to a large
deviation from trading partners, already exceeding the 2008 levels, while the CPI-based indicator is
far more muted on account of the large weight of administered prices in the CPI. On balance, with
persistent erosion in competitiveness under the pegged exchange rate, the current account deficit
has become unsustainable and reserves continue to fall.

volatile variables such as
terms of trade, relative
productivity, relative government consumption, and initial net foreign assets. However, historical
structural breaks in the data (which could also be expected to recur in the event of policy reversal)
undermine the robustness of the results. Moreover, underlying fundamentals and market
expectations are consistent with sizable overvaluation.
With limited policy buffers, Ukraine’s vulnerability to external shocks has risen. Gross reserves
fell to US$20.7 billion by end-October 2013 (36 percent of short-term debt) from a peak of
$38 billion in May 2011. The decline was driven by the large current account deficit and initially by
bank deleveraging and additional household foreign exchange withdrawals, and more recently by
large repayments on outstanding foreign debts (including Fund repurchases). Ukraine scores poorly

1/ The IMF composite measure is calculated as a weighted sum of short-term debt, other portfolio liabilities, broad money, and exports in percent of
GDP, with different weights for "fixed" and "floating" exchange rate regime. Official reserves are recommended to be in the range of 100-150 percent
of the appropriate measure.

Further analysis suggests that closing fiscal and quasi-fiscal policy gaps alone without
devaluation would boost Ukraine’s external sustainability only marginally, while leaving
major vulnerabilities unaddressed. Fiscal consolidation starting in 2014 and targeting a combined
fiscal and quasi-fiscal deficit of 1.9 percent of GDP over the medium term––while keeping the
exchange rate pegged at its current level––would squeeze domestic demand and reduce the
medium term current account deficit to around 6 percent of GDP vs. more than 7 percent under the
baseline. Under this scenario, a double-digit real hryvnia devaluation would still be needed,
however. The positive effects of a smaller fiscal balance on the current account would be broadly
offset by a smaller current account deficit norm driven by the sharp and persistent deterioration in
growth brought by the fiscal consolidation without competitiveness gains. Moreover, such a policy
package would not achieve external sustainability as international reserves would still fall sharply
in 2014—and remain below two months of imports, while short-term debt coverage would remain
below 30 percent throughout the medium term.

Annex III. Public and External Debt Sustainability Analysis
Public debt sustainability risks are significant and public debt is rising rapidly. Under the baseline
scenario, public debt is projected to rise continuously to 60.2 percent of GDP in 2018 as the fiscal
deficit is projected to remain elevated and economic performance depressed. The baseline public debt
profile is subject to considerable risks particularly from lower growth and contingent liabilities. Gross
financing needs are forecast to average 26 percent of GDP over the medium term, pointing to
substantial rollover risks. External debt sustainability is subject to significant vulnerabilities over the
medium term and, the debt is projected to remain elevated at around 75 percent of GDP. Growth or
current account shocks would produce material risks to external debt sustainability.
Macroeconomic and fiscal assumptions: The assumptions underpinning the DSA are those of the
baseline scenario of the staff report. Real GDP growth is projected at -0.3 percent in 2013 rising
gradually to 1.5 percent in the medium term. Inflation is projected to be close to zero in 2013 and
rise to 4 percent in the medium term as growth crosses into positive territory. The overall fiscal
deficit, including Naftogaz’s deficit, is projected to increase dramatically in 2013 (7.7 percent of GDP)
and remain elevated over the medium term. The DSA tool that assesses the realism of the main
assumptions on growth, primary balance, and inflation does not reveal systematic forecast errors.
The definition of public debt in this DSA includes: (i) central government debt as reported by the
authorities; (ii) government guarantees issued for loans extended to state enterprises (including
Naftogaz); and (iii) debt of local governments.
The DSA framework suggests that Ukraine’s public debt is currently below the high-risk
benchmark but is rising rapidly. The DSA suggests that although debt was still moderate at
37 percent of GDP at end-2012, it is projected to rise by about 20 percentage points in the medium
term under a scenario of unchanged policies, reaching 60 percent in 2018. Nevertheless, the debtto-GDP ratio would remain below 70 percent, the indicative threshold used in the DSA framework to
highlight high risk debt levels (red in the standardized heat map on page 4).1
Under a number of individual shock scenarios the debt-to-GDP ratio remains below the
corresponding high-risk benchmark of 70 percent, with the exception of a GDP growth
shock.2 These shocks pertain to an unchanged primary balance or a historical scenario where key
variables remain at their 10-year historical average. Under a growth shock the debt-to-GDP ratio
reaches 74 percent, thus increases by about 14 percentage points and breaches the 70 percent
1

The 70 percent of GDP debt benchmark is based on a cross-country early-warning exercise of emerging market
countries that have experienced episodes of debt distress.
2

The following customization has been made to the various shocks by the team: the growth shock is equal to a half a
standard deviation of the historical growth given that the GDP contraction of 2009 (14.8 percent) was deemed in
staff’s view as extreme; the assumed fiscal multiplier is 0.5 to better reflect country idiosyncrasies; the interest rate on
new debt in the historical scenario is assumed to be equal to the average historical effective interest rate.

indicative threshold (yellow in the heat map on page 4). Other one-time shocks to the primary
balance, the real interest rate and the real exchange rate lead to moderate increases in the debt
profile in the medium term.
A combined macro-fiscal shock and a contingent liability shock would send the debt-to-GDP
ratio above the critical value of 70 percent. The combined macro-fiscal shock is an aggregation
of the shocks to real growth as well as the interest rate, the primary balance and the exchange rate
while taking care not to double-count the effects of individual shocks. This shock produces the
largest effect of all the various individual shocks. The contingent liabilities shock is essentially
designed to highlight risks from implicit guarantees to banks and the state-owned gas importer
Naftogaz. This shock includes an associated shock to growth (this was made consistent with the real
GDP growth shock at 0.5 times the historical standard deviation) and resulting deterioration in the
primary balance together with an increase in interest rates and decrease in inflation.
The baseline scenario and the numerous shocks produced by the DSA template highlight that
Ukraine is exposed to considerable risks related to its large gross budget financing needs.
Under the baseline, gross financing needs are close to 13 percent in 2013 (already above the
indicative threshold for high risk of 10 percent) and approach 44 percent of GDP by 2018. These
shares are magnified under the various shocks, especially under the combined macro-fiscal shock or
the contingent liability shock. The exposure of gross financing needs under the baseline to various
shocks reinforces staff’s argument that continuing large fiscal and quasi-fiscal deficits and an
overvalued exchange rate could not be sustained over the medium term.
A heat map, which is a standard output of the DSA, highlights that Ukraine faces high risks
due to its high gross financing needs and deteriorating debt profile. Risks from the debt level
are deemed low or medium given that the relevant threshold to which Ukraine’s values are
compared is 70 percent and only under the growth shock such a threshold is breached. In terms of
the gross financing needs all relevant cells are red pointing to high risk given that the relevant
threshold is 10 percent and Ukraine breaches this even under the baseline. In addition, risks to the
debt profile are also generally high as captured by Ukraine’s EMBIG spreads, its overall economywide gross external financing requirements, debt held by non-residents and debt held in foreign
currency.
Gross external debt stood at 76.6 percent of GDP at end-2012, and is expected to remain
around 75 percent of GDP over the medium term. A combination of significant repayments of
maturing external debt during 2012 and 2013 (partly out of international reserves) and easy
international market conditions during 2012:H2 and 2013:H1 for the sovereign and corporates have
kept the external debt stock virtually unchanged over the last three years. Moreover, under current
policies, projected large external financing needs and subdued growth over the medium term imply
a persistently elevated level of external debt as a share of GDP. As a result, external debt is now
projected to be 10 percentage points higher at 2018 relative to the DSA projections in the Ukraine
2012 Article IV report (IMF Country Report No. 12/315). Moreover, the deterioration in domestic
fundamentals, and lower demand for Ukrainian exports are expected to keep the ratio of external

debt to exports fairly elevated and rising to 175.8 at 2018 (relative to a declining path to
125 expected last year).
Risks to debt outlook are substantial, if current policies remain unchanged. A permanent
½ standard deviation shock to growth, implying a contraction of around 3.1 percent in 2014 (about
4.1 percentage points below the baseline) and subsequent contractions of 2.6 percent annually
thereafter, would raise the debt-to-GDP ratio to around 94 percent of GDP at 2018 (18.6 percentage
points above the baseline), while the ratio of external debt to exports would reach around
219 percent at 2018 (43.5 percentage points above the baseline). A permanent ½ standard deviation
shock to the current account (excluding interest payments) would [increase external debt to GDP to
85.3 percent at 208 (10 percentage points above the baseline), while the ratio of external debt to
exports would reach around 207 percent at 2018 (31.5 percentage points above the baseline).
Finally, a 30 percent depreciation of the domestic currency with no change in current policies would
raise the debt-to-GDP ratio to 108.2 percent at 2018 (33 percentage points above the baseline).

Annex IV. The Role of Devaluation Expectations in Determining
the Spread Between Local and Foreign Currency Interest Rates
in Ukraine1
This note estimates the impact of devaluation expectations on the spread between deposit interest
rates in the national currency and foreign exchange. It confirms that the devaluation expectations is
the most important factor shaping the deposit spread and thus sustaining high interest rates on
hryvnia deposits and credits to economy.
Figure 1. Exchange Rate, 1992–2013

Background

(Hryvnias per US dollar)

9.0

In Ukraine, long periods of exchange rate stability
intertwined with episodes of steep adjustment. In the
22 years since its introduction, Ukrainian currency went
through three episodes of sharp devaluation: in 1994–95,
1998–99, and in 2008. Between them, the currency was
relatively stable, at around 2 UAH/USD in 1996–98,
5 UAH/USD in 2000–08, and, most recently, at about
8 UAH/USD since 2009 (Figure 1).
Past adjustments and concerns about new shocks
gave rise to persistent devaluation expectations. Over
the last seven years (for which the data is available),
economic agents nearly always expected some
devaluation in the months ahead. And they almost never
projected hryvnia appreciation (Figure 2).
Even though modest devaluation expectations are
quite common for emerging market currencies, their
magnitude in Ukraine is a source of concern.
Sometimes, presence of the devaluation expectations
embedded in the forward contracts is referred to as
“peso problem” (by the name of Mexican currency). It is
largely attributed to the non-zero possibility of acute
shocks that would destabilize the economy and cause
sudden and significant depreciation. Still, it is not
common to see implied devaluation expectations of 20–
30 percent for more than two years, as it was in Ukraine
from mid-2011 (Figure 3).

In 2011–13, elevated devaluation expectations pushed up the national currency deposit and
lending rates. In late 2012, when the pegged

Given the structure of interest rates in Ukraine, the influence of the devaluation expectations

Model estimates
Except for the crisis years of 2008–09, deposit spreads very much followed the dynamics of
the devaluation expectations. The evolution of non-deliverable forward contracts (NDF) on hryvnia
preceded deposit spread changes by about three months. This correlation was broken only in 2008–
09, when currency went through the sharp 60 percent devaluation in late 2008 and stabilized
thereafter, but the forwards kept

(Figure 7). The correlation between these
two series was as high as 0.95.
Also, we considered alternative approaches for measuring devaluation expectations or
accounting for the abnormal deviations of 2008–09. The devaluation expectations derived from
the NBU quarterly surveys (Figure 2) also has high correlation of 0.74 with the deposit rates spread
(with the lag of two months). However, we considered that the quality and representativeness of this
survey-based data—published by the NBU on the quarterly basis until end-2011, and available but
unpublished for 2012–13-is not as robust as that of the series for the NDF contracts. For the episode
of 2008–09, another way to treat the deviation between the NDF quotes and deposits spreads is to
introduce a dummy variable for this period, or estimate regression on the post-crisis data only. Yet
another alternative approach would be to identify macroeconomic or financial variables that could
explain that stark divergence of the expected devaluation and deposit spreads (see below).
To quantify the impact of devaluation expectations on deposit spreads, we estimated several
regressions (Table 1). Predictably, coefficient for the devaluation implied by the NDF forward
contracts came out highly significant. It ranged mostly from 0.26 to 0.30 whether we used the
adjusted variable, or a dummy for the crisis, or estimated the regression only on the post-crisis data
(regressions 1–3 and 6–8). This indicates that every additional 1 percent of expected devaluation
added up to 0.30 percent to the interest rate spread. Moreover, when we forced the constant to
zero, thus attributing all variation in the deposit spread to implied devaluation, the coefficient for it
reached 0.55 (regressions 4). In the presence of this variable, other macroeconomic and financial
variables that one would normally expect to influence the deposit rates (or explain the abnormal

deviations of 2008–09) became insignificant, or had very low coefficient, or unexpected sign
(regressions 5–8).

To confirm robustness of our estimates, we ran several procedures. Granger causality test
strongly confirmed that the adjusted NDF implied devaluation series caused the evolution of the
deposit interest rate spread but not vice versa. It also rejected hypothesis that either GDP growth, or
expected economic conditions (from the NBU quarterly survey), or actual and projected inflation

UKRAINE

granger-caused deposit interest rate spread. Moreover, inflation series had unexpected strong
negative correlation of -0.50 with the deposit spread series. If taken at face value, this suggests that
the spreads should be higher in the period of low inflation (as they did in late 2012), which has no
economic sense. Once again, this confirms that in Ukraine, inflation was not among the main
determinant of the deposit interest rate spread in recent years.
To better understand modalities of the pass through from devaluation expectations to
deposit spread, we estimated a simple vector autoregressive model (VAR). The series for both
adjusted NDF implied devaluation and deposit spread are non-stationary in levels but stationary in
first difference. Even though the series exhibit very similar dynamics (Figure 7) and have very high
correlation, the standard tests rejected hypotheses of their cointegration. This opened the way for
estimating a standard VAR for the first differences. We estimated VAR with three lags including
these two series, and then produced standardized accumulated impulse responses (Figure 8). Next,
we used them to study the impact of one variable on another and estimate the pass through, which
can be calculated by dividing the accumulated response of the spread variable to the accumulated
shock in the devaluation variable. According to this analysis, the pass-through coefficient from the
implied devaluation to the deposit spreads reaches as high as 0.35 in seven months after original
devaluation expectation shock, and then, after some fluctuations, settles at about 0.29 in 12 months
after the shock (Table 2). In other words, when devaluation expectation increase by 1 percentage
point due to an economic shock, deposit spreads increase eventually by 0.29 percentage points.

Conclusions and policy implications
Our results confirmed that the devaluation expectations is the most important factor shaping
the deposit interest rate spread and thus sustaining high interest rates on hryvnia deposits.
According to various estimates, an additional 1 percentage point of the devaluation expectation
contributes about 0.26–0.30 percentage points to the deposit spread. And as it contributes to the
deposit spread, it raises proportionally the interest rates on term deposits in hryvnia. Therefore,
harnessing devaluation expectations is a critical precondition for reducing hryvnia deposit rates.
By implication, high deposit interest rates translate into high credit rates for economy.
Normally, one would expect the loan rates to be above deposit rates, with the difference between
them accounting for such items as transaction costs, credit risks provision, and bank operational
profits. In Ukraine, this was the case in the years before the crisis of 2008 (Figure 5). After the crisis,
the difference between deposit and the medium-term lending rates nearly disappeared. Still, the
loan rates can hardly go and stay for a long time below the deposit rates (otherwise, the companies
taking bank loans could simply deposit them in another bank for higher rate). Thus, reducing
hryvnia deposit rates is critically important for cutting credit rates for economy. And, as summarized
above, this requires reducing the devaluation expectations first.
Our analysis has identified one important exception associated with the crisis episode of
2008–09, when the skyrocketing devaluation expectations did not result in proportionally
high deposit rates spread. What was the reason of a wide deviation between the implied

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

63

UKRAINE

devaluation and deposit spreads in 2008–09, and why this did not happen again in 2011 or late 2012
(Figure 7)? In our view, this was due to the different policy response to the crisis events and market
pressures. In 2008, the authorities allowed steep devaluation of the national currency, but
introduced a number of measures for providing liquidity to banks and restricting deposit outflow
from them. NBU provided ample stabilization loans to banks, particularly those experiencing deposit
outflows, and bailed out several banks that became insolvent. Also, it introduced a temporary ban
on the early withdrawal of term deposits, which was in place from October 2008 to May 2009 (with a
modification in December 2008). In these circumstances, banks refrained from raising deposit rates
even as they lost about 25 percent of hryvnia deposits and 20 percent of foreign currency deposits
in six months from September 2008. On the contrary, in late 2012 NBU chose to defend the
exchange rate peg at all cost despite mounting devaluation pressures, including by squeezing
banks’ liquidity. That forced the banks to compete hard for deposits and raise deposit rates to the
level when they look attractive even amid high devaluation expectations. As a result, the devaluation
was avoided, and hryvnia deposits in banks increased by 20 percent in the six months from
November 2008, while foreign deposits stagnated.
Providing concrete recommendations on how to reduce the devaluation expectations goes
beyond the scope of this paper. Our results confirmed only that the unusually high devaluation
expectations resulting from the economic policy mix implemented in 2012–13 gave rise to high
deposit interest rates. This suggests that significant changes in the exchange rate regime and
monetary policy priorities are required to lower hryvnia interest rates in the economy.

Annex V. Ukraine: Enhancing the Operational Monetary Policy
Framework1
This annex outlines proposals for refocusing NBU’s operational framework from controlling banks
liquidity to managing short-term interest rates, which is critically important step on the way towards
inflation targeting and more flexible exchange rate regime.
Comprehensive reform of the NBU monetary policy framework is required to improve its
efficiency and adjust to new challenges. The existing operational framework aims to regulate
banks liquidity on a high-frequency basis through a mix of market and administrative measures. This
is particularly important for ensuring exchange rate stability, which has long been the main
operational objective of the NBU. However, this framework made short-term market interest rates
volatile and unpredictable at the times of exchange rate pressures. It also limited policy transmission
through the interest rate channel and discouraged interbank market development. To facilitate
transition to a flexible exchange rate regime and eventual adoption of the inflation targeting, NBU
should shift the focus from controlling liquidity volumes to managing short-term interest rates.
Interbank rates deviated particularly far from
the official policy rates in the 2012:H2, amid
intensive pressures on the pegged exchange
rate. During this period, the interbank rates
hovered in double digits and reached as high as
50 percent in November 2012. Meanwhile, the
official NBU rates remained unchanged, with the
policy rate set at 7.5 percent, and the rate for
providing unsecured refinancing to bank at
10.5 percent. NBU strictly rationed financing
provided to banks at the official rates, thus
reducing their relevance as indicators of shortterm credit rates. For banks, this episode
demonstrated that in case of liquidity stress they
cannot rely on the NBU refinancing, while the cost
of interbank credit can be prohibitively expensive.
This prompted banks to maintain high liquidity
“buffers,” which diminished their potential for
providing credit to economy. Also, it undermined
the transmission mechanism from the NBU policy
rates to the bank credit rates and, ultimately, to
economic growth and inflation.

Introducing the new operational monetary policy framework would involve three main
reforms.


First, increase the role of the NBU policy rate in steering market interest rates, which can be
achieved by promoting the operational instrument with the interest rate closely linked to the
policy rate.



Second, create automatic standing facilities that banks can freely use for borrowing from
and lending to the NBU without fear of formal or informal sanctions or stigma associated
with using official financing, which would set the limits of the “corridor” for short-term
market interest rates.



Finally, introduce a reserve averaging period and give more flexibility to banks in managing
their liquidity over it.



If successfully implemented, the new system would ensure that the short-term market
interest rates fluctuate around the key policy rate within the corridor defined by the standing
facilities.

To increase the role of its policy rate, the NBU can directly link to it the rates on its main
money market operational instruments. In
Liquidity Provision and Absorption by NBU, 2013

(UAH billion)
of two main instruments supporting the key
policy rate: one that provides liquidity and

another that absorbs it. The interest rate on

regularly and initially rather frequently (but not

Source: NBU
instruments will likely become redundant,
except for the moments of liquidity stress. In this way, the system will evolve towards having only
one key instrument, most likely the one absorbing liquidity. This is consistent with the liquidity
surplus prevailing in the banking system, and NBU liquidity absorption operations by far outpacing
liquidity provision in 2013.
For the main liquidity absorbing instrument, the NBU could use the already existing auction
for placing 7-day or 14-day certificates of deposits (CDs). For the complementing liquidity
providing instrument, NBU can use 7-day or 14-day repurchasing agreements (repos). And whatever
auction format is chosen, these main instruments should be provided in price-setting (as opposed to
price-taking) manner. To prop the importance of these two instruments, all other operations at the
short end of the yield curve should be discontinued as soon as possible. Moreover, longer-term

66

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

UKRAINE

operations could be phased out as well. While it is important that a reliable hryvnia yield curve is
gradually developed using long-term benchmark securities, they should be issued by the
government rather than the central bank, as is the standard practice in other countries.
Nevertheless, as long as the NBU continues to offer longer-term instruments, it should do so strictly
in a price-taking fashion, not to compromise the price-setting role of its main instruments at the
short end of the yield curve.
To introduce the “corridor” for short-term interest rates, the NBU can use the existing
overnight deposit and refinancing (Lombard) facilities. The NBU already operates an overnight
(O/N) collateralized refinancing facility, which

placement of overnight CDs could create the
lower limit of the corridor. These standing
facilities on both sides of the corridor should operate in a fully automatic regime, and access to
them should be made very easy for all solvent banks (at their discretion). The interest rates
“corridor” could be set rather wide at first, but shortened gradually (as NBU started to do in JulySeptember). Eventually, it can be narrowed to 200–300 bps, which is most effective for controlling
the interbank rates.
Finally, allowing for flexible management of liquidity by banks is a cornerstone of interbank
market deepening and strong monetary policy transmission. The NBU has developed a complex

period of two weeks or one month, allowing them flexibility to manage their liquidity within this
period. Also, the reserve requirements on foreign exchange and hryvnia deposits could be made
more uniform. As a first step, NBU can consider introducing a small positive reserve requirement on
hryvnia deposits, which are now exempt. Also, changes to the reserve requirements should become
less frequent and come with advance guidance giving banks enough time to prepare.
Implementation of the main elements of the new policy framework can be completed within a
year. They can be made operational simultaneously with the shift to a more flexible exchange rate
regime, which the new monetary policy framework would support. Good reception of the new
measures by the banking community would require intensive communication. Practical experience
and feedback from the market participants would help refine the new instruments and make the
enhanced operational monetary framework most effective in achieving NBU’s policy objectives.

Annex VI. Determinants of Sovereign Borrowing Costs from
International Markets1
Large part of Ukraine’s debt is financed externally. The high exposure to external financing makes
Ukraine vulnerable to shocks. Our analysis suggests that changes in sovereign borrowing costs heavily
depend on: (i) movements in global market sentiment that is beyond the control of Ukrainian
authorities; and (ii) domestic macroeconomic, external, and fiscal fundamentals that are affected by
economic policies. The results suggest that targeted policy measures should be put in place to improve
macroeconomic fundamentals, maintain access to international capital markets, and reduce borrowing
costs going forward.
Background
Ukraine’s sovereign heavily relies on external sources of debt financing. Over the last decade,
the share of the FX-denominated debt in the general government total debt was fluctuating around
70 percent. Quasi-sovereign entities (SOEs), including Naftogaz and Ukrainian Railways, are also
financing parts of their debt externally.
Heavy reliance on external debt financing makes Ukraine’s sovereign highly exposed to
sudden changes in global market sentiment. The ratio of government’s external debt to GDP has
risen from 9.7 percent in 2007 to 22.2 percent in 2012. Large placements of Eurobonds took place in
2012–13, and secondary market rates on Eurobonds have risen recently. The cost of external
financing depends on two main determinants: global factors and domestic fundamentals
(macroeconomic, external, and fiscal). Global factors are not under control of the Ukrainian
authorities and represent a major uncertainty for their borrowing costs. Domestic economic
fundamentals, at least some of them, could be directly influenced by economic policies and could
cushion the impact of global factors.
This paper provides an empirical assessment of global and domestic factors driving sovereign
borrowing costs in Ukraine. Existing empirical studies analyze panels of emerging markets (EM)
and estimate pooled coefficients measuring sensitivity of sovereign borrowing costs in these groups
of countries as a whole to changes in global factors and economic fundamentals (Csonto and
Ivaschenko, 2013). However, the results that are valid for a panel of EMs may not be valid for
individual countries (Nickel et al., 2009). Our objective is to estimate Ukraine-specific sensitivity
coefficients and come up with policy recommendations based on these estimates.
How to measure external borrowing costs?
External borrowing costs of EMs, including Ukraine, are driven by four main sources of risk.
Credit risk represents the risk of default arising due to country’s inability or unwillingness to meet its
obligations. Interest rate risk reflects the exposure of sovereign bond’s market value to unexpected

interest rate changes. Exchange rate risk measures the exposure of sovereign bond’s market value to
currency movements. Liquidity risk highlights the likelihood that investor may not be able to sell the
bond on the secondary market, at least, without a large discount.
The EMBI spread index by JP Morgan provides a measure of credit risk.2 The EMBI spread index
is calculated as the weighted average difference in yields between Ukraine’s sovereign and quasisovereign bonds and U.S. Treasuries. To control for the exchange rate risk, the index only includes
U.S. dollar denominated Ukrainian bonds. To control for the interest rate risk, the index matches the
duration of Ukraine’s bonds and U.S. Treasuries and makes adjustments for unusual bond
characteristics (floating coupons, principal collateral, rolling interest guarantees, etc.). Finally, to
minimize the liquidity risk, the index includes only bonds with sufficient secondary market liquidity, a
minimum face value of USD 500 million, and at least 2.5 years of maturity at the time of inclusion.
Nevertheless, the liquidity risk is not fully eliminated from the index, and the EMBI spread could
slightly overstate the credit risk especially in periods of global financial stress.
The EMBI spread index for Ukraine has been volatile over the past decade (Figure 1). The index
started from a relatively high level (2000 basis

benign international environment (“great
moderation”). However, this period was also characterized by the buildup of macroeconomic
imbalances (real exchange rate appreciation, widening of the current account deficit, rapid expansion
of credit) exposing the economy to shocks. When the Lehman crisis unfolded, EMBI spreads for
Ukraine jumped more than 10 times to historically record 3,000 basis points level. Following the
crisis, the movements in spread were quite volatile. The spread has declined to 500 basis points in
2009, following the start of the 2008 SBA with the IMF. However, it climbed up to 1,000 basis points
at end-2011 on the back of Greek debt restructuring woes, continuing difficulties with resolving the
euro area crisis, and supported by a slowdown of economic reforms in Ukraine. Since then and until
most recently, the spread has been on a declining trend fueled by quantitative easing policies by the
U.S. Federal Reserve system and the launch of “Abenomics” in Japan. This declining path was
interrupted in June 2013 following Federal Reserve chair Bernanke’s “tapering” remarks on
May 22, 2013.

What are the main drivers of external borrowing costs?
External borrowing costs of EMs depend on domestic fundamentals, which directly influence
sovereign credit risk. The ability of the sovereign to meet its obligations depends on fundamental
drivers of public debt sustainability.


Macroeconomic fundamentals. High economic growth reduces spreads through improved
debt sustainability driven by lower interest growth differential. The impact of inflation is
uncertain. On the one hand, high level of inflation can lead to higher spreads if inflation is
regarded as a proxy for a bad economic management (Min et al., 2003). On the other hand,
moderately high inflation helps to “inflate debt away” and improves the tax base that
government can use to service its debt (Alexopoulou et al., 2009).
In Ukraine, monthly economic growth
proxied by industrial production index
was quite high (12 percent on average)
and inflation moderate (10 percent on
average) prior to the crisis (Figure 2),
contributing to the compression of
sovereign spreads. During the crisis,
economic growth dipped and inflation
soared, contributing to the sharp hike
of the spread. In the aftermath of the
crisis and until most recently, both
economic growth and inflation were on
a declining path.

External fundamentals. Real exchange rate depreciation should generally enhance debt
sustainability and reduce borrowing costs through improved external competitiveness (Min
et al., 2003). However, improvements in external competitiveness driven by a rapid
depreciation in nominal exchange rate can undermine fiscal sustainability if the share of
foreign currency denominated debt is high. High levels of FX reserves enhance a country’s
ability to service its external debt and

resulted in a record 30 percent real depreciation in 2009. The improved external
competitiveness contributed to the compression of the spread in 2009. The FX reserves-toGDP ratio has risen from 10 percent in 2003 to 20 percent at the onset of the crisis.
Supported by the IMF program, the reserves did not decline rapidly during the crisis.
However, more recently FX reserves started to decline, coming down back to the 10 percent
of GDP level. This was largely driven by inflexible nominal exchange rate policies pursued by
the authorities in the aftermath of the crisis, the consequent real exchange rate appreciation,
and large repayments of FX loans falling due in 2013.


Fiscal fundamentals. High fiscal deficit leads to higher borrowing costs through increased
financing needs and rising supply of debt (Laubach, 2009; Baldacci et al., 2008). High levels of
public debt also lead to higher borrowing costs, as high debt is more vulnerable to
macroeconomic shocks and is more difficult to sustain (Engen and Hubbard, 2004; Baldacci
and Kumar, 2010).
In Ukraine, fiscal fundamentals have been improving in the run-up to the crisis (Figure 4).
Supported by high growth rates, the

vulnerable for EMs by the IMF’s debt

However, domestic fundamentals alone are not reliable predictors of sovereign borrowing
costs. First, economic fundamentals are slow moving variables and statistics on these variables is
available at a low frequency (quarterly or monthly). Hence, these variables by definition cannot
explain the higher frequency changes in EMBI spreads. Second, as mentioned above, EMBI spreads
reflect also liquidity risk, which is mostly driven by global liquidity conditions influencing decisions of
international investors even in the presence of unchanged credit risk (Balakrishnan et al., 2009). Third,
economic fundamentals can sometimes lag market perceptions (Monfort and Mulder, 2000;
Sy, 2002). Finally, market perceptions can sometimes overreact to economic fundamentals, especially
at the early stages of the crisis (Mulder and Perelli, 2001).

Global factors are also important drivers of sovereign borrowing costs, especially in the shortrun. Various studies have shown that there is a strong positive correlation between global factors
and EM bond spreads, which tends to increase

sovereign spreads of EMs (Gonzalez-Rozada and
Sources: Datastream
Levy Yeyati, 2008; Hartelius et al., 2008). Most
empirical models nowadays include global factors as determinants of EM bond spreads. The most
widely used determinant employed in the literature is the VIX index proxying global risk aversion.3 As
shown in Figure 5, VIX index closely tracks the dynamics of EMBI spread in Ukraine, suggesting a
strong association between the two.
How sensitive are Ukraine’s borrowing costs to global factors and domestic fundamentals?
We regress Ukraine’s EMBI index on global factors and domestic macroeconomic, external,
and fiscal fundamentals (Table 1). The intercept-only regression shown in column (I) suggests that
the EMBI spread in Ukraine has averaged at 5.7 percent level (intercept) over the sample under
consideration. In column (II), we include the crisis dummy that takes the value of 1 during
October 2008–Dececember 2009 and obtain a coefficient estimate of 12.9 percent. The large
coefficient on the crisis dummy suggests that macroeconomic instability during the crisis period
coupled with the vulnerabilities built up before the crisis has led to a dramatic widening of the
spread in the order of magnitude of exceeding twice of its historical average and a consequent loss
of market access. The impact of other determinants can be summarized as follows:


Global factors. One unit increase in VIX leads to about 40 basis points increase in EMBI
spread. The strong impact of global risk aversion suggests that changes in Ukrainian
sovereign borrowing costs are highly vulnerable to changes in global market sentiment.4

3

The Chicago Board Options Exchange Volatility Index (VIX) is a measure of the market’s expectation of stock-market
volatility over the next 30-day period. It is a weighted blend of prices for a range of options on the S&P 500 index.
4

The adjusted R^2 in column (III) is 0.75, suggesting that increase in global risk aversion and deterioration of
domestic fundamentals during the crisis period explain three quarters of the EMBI spread variation. However, in a
separate exercise we found that the magnitude of R^2 heavily depends on the sequencing of factors entering the
specification. For instance, additional contribution of global factors to R^2 is only 0.1 if VIX enters the specification
after controlling for all domestic fundamentals.



Macroeconomic fundamentals. A 1 percentage point increase in industrial production
annual growth rate leads to about 9 basis point reduction in spreads; the same increase
in CPI leads to 13 basis points reduction. The negative sign on the inflation variable
suggests that the positive effects of inflation on debt sustainability (increase in the
taxable base) outpace the negative effects (bad economic management). All in all, the
negative signs of both coefficients suggest that sovereign spreads will be under upward
pressure should slowdown in economic activity and deflationary tendencies persist going
forward.



External fundamentals. A 1 percentage point increase in REER pushes spreads up by
11 basis points. The positive impact of a 1 percentage point decline in FX reserves-toGDP ratio is even stronger: 19 basis points. The latter finding suggests that the declining
trend in FX reserves, if not reverted, can increase sovereign borrowing costs even further.

74

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

UKRAINE



Fiscal fundamentals. A 1 percentage point increase in debt-to-GDP ratio pushes
spreads up by 5.5 basis points; the same increase in deficit-to-GDP ratio pushes them up
by to 114 basis points. The higher sensitivity of spreads to deficit ratio is related to
scaling issues, as one percentage point increase in deficit per month is equivalent of 12
percentage points increase per annum. The high sensitivity of borrowing costs to debt
ratio provides a strong case for fiscal consolidation, which is essential for restoring the
fiscal space eroded in the aftermath of the crisis and reducing external borrowing costs in
Ukraine.

Annex VII. Ukraine: Government Expenditures—Options for
Fiscal Consolidation1
Background
Ukraine suffers from external imbalances and low growth. A de facto exchange rate peg
policy pursued by NBU worsened external competitiveness and hampered credit growth.
Headline inflation has fallen rapidly on account of tight monetary policy, flat utility prices, and
decelerating economic activity. Expansionary fiscal policies introduced additional rigidity to
current expenditures and contributed to the further worsening of external imbalances. Public
debt-to-GDP ratio tripled from its pre-crisis levels and is on path to exceed 40 percent, often
considered a danger zone for emerging economies, putting pressure on near term refinancing
needs and the sovereign risk premium.
Fiscal consolidation policies are needed to stabilize the economy, and some progress has
already been made in certain areas of fiscal structural reforms: (i) a new tax code was
approved in 2010, which treats all taxes under one legal framework and sets up the near-term tax
policy outlook; (ii) a new customs code reduced the time for customs clearance from 24 to four
hours and set up a “single window” shop; (iii) a comprehensive pension reform approved in
late 2011 aligned the retirement age for women (from 55 to 60) to men (60) and increased the
years of service for pension eligibility, with expected medium-term annual savings of 1.8 percent
of GDP; (iv) some progress was made to strengthen tax administration by centralizing the Large
Taxpayers Office; (v) some progress was made in automating tax refunds, with the latest data
showing that 50 percent of all VAT receipts being refunded via automated system; and
(vi) amended double taxation treaty with Cyprus was ratified, and transfer pricing regulation was
adopted by Parliament.
However, further structural fiscal reforms in the area of public expenditure are imperative
to maintain macroeconomic stability and sustain medium-term economic development.
Fiscal consolidation will contribute to the reduction of external imbalances, will help regaining
fiscal space lost in the aftermath of the crisis, and will reduce financing needs and lower
sovereign risk premium. There are good reasons for the consolidation to be largely expendituredriven, as the level of government expenditures relative to the GDP is very high. Moreover, it is
current expenditures that should be subject to consolidation, as capital expenditures have
already been reduced to historically low levels. There is very limited room for revenue-based
consolidation, as the level of government revenues relative to the GDP is already high and it
would be difficult to raise revenues substantially without harming growth prospects.

Diagnostics: Comparison of government expenditures in Ukraine and other transition
countries
Government expenditures in Ukraine are high. There is scope to achieve the much needed
fiscal consolidation by reducing public expenditures, which are high in absolute (close to
50 percent of GDP) and relative (third largest among comparator countries) terms. The case for
expenditure-driven consolidation is further justified by little room for tax rate hikes given the
already high revenue-to-GDP ratio (close to 45 percent of GDP, fifth largest among comparator
countries).

Comparisons with other transition countries suggest that high current expenditures are
the underlying cause for high government spending. Current expenditures in Ukraine
(45 percent of GDP) are the second highest (after Hungary) among comparator countries. By
contrast, capital expenditures (3 percent of GDP and falling further in 2013) are relatively low.
This low level of capital expenditures, if sustained for a long period, can harm long-term growth
prospects (Acosta-Ormaechea and Morozumi, 2013). Shifting the composition of spending from
current to capital expenditures is therefore needed to establish a more growth-friendly structure
of public spending, especially in the much-needed infrastructure projects.
The skewed distribution of spending is in part a legacy of the boom years. During 2002–08,
expenditure growth outpaced that of revenues. Constrained by financing considerations, sharp
expenditure cuts during the 2009 recession squeezed capital expenditure to make room for
wages, pensions and various transfers. In fact, in Ukraine there is a large discrepancy in execution
rates for current expenditures and capital expenditures (97 percent versus 70 percent) as capital
expenditures are less rigid than current expenditures. Capital investment in infrastructure
averaged just 2 percent of GDP over the last decade, around one-fourth the level of dynamic
emerging market economies in Asia. Years of underinvestment and inefficient use of resources
have left public infrastructure in disrepair and have generated a significant backlog of needed
public infrastructure investments.

One of the current spending items that stands out as high is social benefits. Social benefits
spending in Ukraine (including pension and non-pension benefits) at 22 percent of GDP level
stands out as the highest among comparators. The pension reform implemented in 2011 aimed
at containing this spending category (pension expenditures) in the long-run, but short-term
benefits of the reform were eroded by ad-hoc increases in pension benefits.2
Another expenditure item that is relatively high is that compensation of employees, which
exceeds 11 percent of GDP. Average public sector wage levels in Ukraine are below the
economy-wide average with the exception of public administration which reflects a small share
of public employment. The main reason for the high wage bill is the size of public sector
employment (about one third of total employment).

The 2011 pension reform included the following cost-reducing measures: (i) gradually raising the retirement
age for women to 60 years, (ii) lengthening the insurance period to qualify for minimum pension benefit;
(iii) gradually converging special and early pension regimes with the regular one, mainly through lengthening the
service period; and (iv) capping the maximum pension at 10 subsistence minimums. Long-run savings from this
reform were projected to be 1.8 percent of GDP annually, and fiscal gains in the first three years of
implementation were projected to be 0.5 percent of GDP annually.

3.5 million pensioners earning more than UAH 1,500 per month. This jump is largely driven by
privileged pensions, which are generous and not means-tested. The skewed distribution of
pensions is further illustrated by the fact that 44 percent of total pension spending is directed to
the 26 percent of total pensioners located in the above UAH 1,500 per month bracket. The
average replacement rate at 50 percent is among the highest in the region.
A few key parameters can be used to summarize the financial situation of the pension
system. The pension system in Ukraine is PAYG and can be described by the following identity:

where: =contribution rate, =pension replacement ratio, W=average wage, P=number of
pensioners, C=number of contributors (workers), =share of total expenditures covered by CG as
deficit financing.
Rearranging the above equation yields the below expression for deficit financing ratio:

which suggests that PF deficit financing can be reduced by: (i) increasing the contribution rate
( ); (ii) increasing the number of contributors (C); (iii) reducing the pension replacement ratio ( );
and/or (iv) reducing the number of eligible pensioners (P).
Guided by the above accounting, the following measures could be considered by the
authorities to improve the soundness of state pension finances:


Reduce the accrual rate back to 1% (from current 1.35 %)



Repeal indexation of pensions by 20 percent of average wage growth (if higher than the
CPI growth) and keep only CPI indexation



Delink minimum pension benefits from minimum subsistence and introduce means
testing for minimum subsistence supplement



Reduce unfunded privileged/special pensions through: (i) widening the contribution
period to qualify for such benefits; (ii) raising the retirement age and service period; and
(iii) converging the accrual rate and indexation for civil servants to the general system



Consider further increases in the retirement age in line with the increase in life
expectancy

Compensation of employees
Though low on average, wages in the public sector are heterogeneous and have been
rising rapidly. The average wage in the public sector does not appear to be excessively high, but
wages in public administration exceed economy-wide wages, and wages in education also
appear to be relatively high. Furthermore, public sector wages display a growth trend that
exceeds that of inflation and nominal GDP, with generous wage hikes reemerging in 2011–13,
primarily through the issuance of supplementary budgets. Given no significant changes in
employment, the large wage increases have contributed to an increase in the wage bill as a share
of GDP for every year since 2010. The wage bill has climbed from 10.4 percent of GDP in 2011 to
a projected 11.7 percent in 2013.



Contain public sector wage growth below CPI growth for a couple of years to offset large
real growth rates in 2012–13, with the aim of reducing the wage bill to 10 percent of GDP
in the medium term.
Perform functional analysis of critical sectors to identify areas for efficiency
enhancements.
Reassess appropriateness of public sector norms and speed up the shift to per capita
allocation of resources and performance-based budgeting.
Conduct public employment census to identify areas where main problems lie, to
eliminate vacant positions by gradually introducing elements of attrition in public
employment.

Annex VIII. Reforming Energy Subsidies in Ukraine1
Background

Ukraine’s energy sector problems are
to a large extent caused by large
energy subsidies that bridge the gaps
between retail and cost-recovery
prices for gas and heating. While retail
prices for industrial consumers and
budget-funded entities reflect the full
pass through of import prices, the utility
companies serving households currently
receive gas at 28 percent of full import
pass-through price while the average
household pays about 19 percent of the
full import pass-through price. Despite
the subsidized gas input, utilities’ prices

to households are, on average, only about 70 percent of their cost-recovery level net of a return
on investment.
The energy market is segmented across various consumers leading to arbitrage
opportunities and undermining energy sector transparency. Market prices to the industrial
sector have stimulated the search for efficiency gains and have led to a dramatic reduction in
consumption. However, demand by households and district heating companies has remained
remarkably stable reflecting low price elasticity but also waste by households given the very low
tariffs. Furthermore, a cost-plus approach to pricing by district heating companies inflates input
costs and stifles the search for efficiency gains. Finally, given large tariff differentials across
consumer groups, there are strong incentives to siphon off cheap gas intended for households to
higher-paying industrial customers.

The large energy sector subsidies weigh heavily on public finances, which pose risks to
medium-term fiscal sustainability. The large subsidies are a legacy of the break-up of the
Soviet Union when Ukraine, accustomed to very low energy prices, faced large energy price
adjustments. While on the decline until 2006 and converging to the average for transition
countries, post-tax energy subsidies on gas and heating started to increase again when Russia
started to raise gas prices for Ukraine.2 The 2009 gas contract between Ukraine and Gazprom

2

Post-tax subsidies are defined as the difference between a benchmark price (in the case of Ukraine this would
be the international price for gas appropriately adjusted for transport and distribution costs) and the price paid
by energy consumers. The benchmark price includes an adjustment for efficient taxation to reflect both revenue
needs (for example, energy should be taxed the same way as any other consumer product) and a correction for
negative consumption externalities (for instance, pollution).

86

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

UKRAINE

reinforced this trend. By 2012, post-tax energy subsidies amounted to 7.6 percent of GDP.3
Previous attempts to dismantle subsidies have failed amid hesitation by strong vested interests
and political economy considerations. Nevertheless, many transition countries have already
tackled energy sector subsidies successfully and useful lessons can be drawn from their reform
experiences.
Drawing from other countries’ best practice experiences, Ukraine should design an energy
subsidy reform that can begin relatively quickly, though proceed gradually. Evidence from
other countries seems to suggest that a successful reform strategy must have three key
ingredients: (i) analytical clarity about the size and distribution of existing subsidies; (ii) programs
to mitigate the impact of subsidy removals on the most vulnerable; (iii) effective communication
to various stakeholders of the need for reform.
Empirical Evidence
Cross-country evidence suggests that energy subsidies are generally ill targeted (IMF 2013).
Energy subsidies have wide-ranging economic consequences. They undermine a government’s
fiscal position through higher fiscal deficits, lower outlays for priority public spending, or higher
taxes. Underpriced energy leads to a misallocation of resources through overconsumption as well
as balance of payments pressures when the country is an energy importer. In addition, it deters
investment in the energy sector. Finally, energy subsidies can undermine institutions and
reinforce inequality.
Econometric estimates performed by staff suggest that natural gas subsidies have a
negative, substantial, and statistically significant impact on real per capita GDP growth
(see Table below).4 Another important finding of the regression analysis is the positive and
significant impact of capital investment on economic growth pointing to the likelihood that
energy subsidies, by draining government resources, may undermine the growth-generating
channels of the economy such as human and capital investment. Finally, subsidies may also
impact growth performance indirectly by undermining fiscal sustainability, increasing debt,
3

Of this amount only 1.3 percent of GDP was recorded on budget (as cash injections and subventions to local
government to pay heating utilities). The rest is either below-the-line operations such as recapitalization bonds or
off-budget write-off of arrears as well as non-central government sources like early receipt of gas transit fees
from Russia’s Gazprom. Currently direct transfers to Naftogaz and heating utilities are recorded in the budget at
the beginning of the fiscal year, but generally these are insufficient to cover all their financing needs. This in turn
leads to amendments to the state budget. The remainder is covered by recapitalization bonds. Recapitalization
bonds are treated as a financing item in the central government budget notwithstanding Naftogaz’s large past
and expected future losses, which would call for its recording as transfers in the budget based on GFSM 2001.
Obviously the indirect subsidies to heating utilities for purchasing gas at a subsidized price are also not recorded
in the budget.
4

The growth regressions point to an inconclusive effect of total energy subsidies (kerosene, gasoline, diesel, and
natural gas) but to a highly significant and negative effect for natural gas subsidies. The regression results are
presented for both, a fixed effects estimation and a generalized method of moments (GMM) estimation which
also addresses concerns about endogeneity, which are common in growth regressions.

eroding a government’s ability to invest in pro-growth spending like health, education,
infrastructure, as well as exacerbating economic volatility. This implies that the coefficients
reported in the regressions table may underestimate the total negative impact of energy
subsidies on growth.

areas. The skewed distribution
of subsidies is in part driven by the fact that benefits are awarded to categories of households or
individuals without regard to the economic well being of the recipient. The discounts for the
purchase of housing utilities provided by Ukraine’s privilege programs are the largest source of
assistance for families in mitigating the cost of natural gas and district heating. Housing
privileges are skewed toward higher-income households because they are calculated as a share
of total spending and a larger share of households in the upper income quintiles qualifies.
Poorer households spend a larger share of their incomes on gas and heating. For

Restarting Energy Sector Reforms
Ukraine faces the challenge of designing and implementing a broad-based energy reform
agenda. A comprehensive reform plan in Ukraine would stand on four pillars: (i) adjust energy
tariffs to cost-recovery levels and eliminate chronic losses in Naftogaz, the state-owned gas
holding company, while protecting the most vulnerable; (ii) accelerate heat/gas metering
installation and energy saving efforts, as a complement to the indispensable tariff hikes;
(iii) diversify gas imports away from Russia; and (iv) increase domestic gas exploration and
production, including by overcoming obstacles delaying exploration of Ukraine’s shale gas
reserves.
A broad-based and sizable adjustment of energy prices is urgently needed and offers the
best prospect for bringing Naftogaz finances to a sustainable footing. Significant increases
in gas and heating tariffs are essential, as a fiscal measure to reduce the fiscal cost of subsidies
and also as a key structural reform to reduce energy use and help diversify the economy. To kick
off the reform process, tariffs for households and utilities should increase immediately by at least
40 percent. Furthermore, a schedule should be adopted to raise tariffs to the cost recovery level
over the next three years through semiannual increases of 20 percent until mid-2016. Tariffs to
industry would increase broadly in line with exchange rate movements. Higher tariffs, somewhat
higher gas sales to industry (due to improvements in Ukraine’s competitiveness and the incipient
economic recovery), as well as efficiency gains would lead to operational cost recovery for
Naftogaz in the medium term.
To offset the effect of tariff adjustment on the poor, the existing system of targeted social
assistance would need to be scaled up to protect the bottom two quintiles of the income
distribution. This would imply the need to refocus the social assistance system so that support is
given on the basis of income rather than privileges. Income is already used as a qualification
criterion for the provision of the Guaranteed Minimum Income (GMI) as well as housing utilities
subsidies, and the World Bank believes that these programs can be scaled up within a six-month
period. Currently the Ministry of Social Protection oversees a network of local government offices
at which citizens can apply for need-based assistance for both GMI and housing utilities
(heating/natural gas/other) subsidies using a single application. The system includes procedures
for validating eligibility and implementing assistance. However, currently GMI receives only
4 percent of the social assistance budget. Its benefits are well-targeted with criteria for inclusion
being very stringent and benefits being low. Coverage is extremely low at less than 5 percent of
the households in the bottom quintile.5 Ultimately, Ukraine would need to move toward the
consolidation of social assistance into a single cash-transfer system such as GMI by shifting out
of benefits focused on the cost of housing utilities into targeted cash benefits.

This situation calls for scaling up GMI. Such scaling up would need to strike a balance between excluding a

deserving household against including a household that should not qualify.



A few reform options could be implemented in Ukraine within a one year horizon:
 Scale up GMI. The goal for the authorities would be to increase GMI coverage. However,
increased coverage has to be carefully managed to ensure that targeting performance is
not undermined. The government can increase the income threshold that would allow for
more poor people to be covered by the program while also increasing the benefit
amount. Scaling up GMI would require improving the infrastructure for targeting and
delivering social assistance by improved management information systems with universal
access throughout the system and improving the procedures for approving applicants
and auditing procedures for certifying eligibility. In particular, the information network
among local offices and the Ministry of Social Protection can be improved.
 Restructuring of current benefit for housing utilities. One way of reforming these subsidies
is by introducing a cost-sharing system rather than the existing cap system, which
rewards households that spend more a certain share of their income on utilities. Such a
reform would limit utilities benefits to a predefined group of poor households and can be
implemented almost immediately with minimal adjustment to the current infrastructure.
 One-off cash transfers. These transfers could be linked to the tariff increase for a
predefined share of the population and for households expected to have difficulty paying
the higher tariffs. Such transfers could be a supplement to the GMI for certain months of
the year, such as the heating season.
 Lifeline tariff for gas and heating. Setting lifeline tariff entails providing a minimal amount
of gas and/or heating at heavily subsidized prices to households. This option could be
implemented if sufficient progress is made on meter installation. Gas meter installation is
underway and at a good point but district heat meters are further behind, so there could
be a differentiation between heat and gas treatment.6 Problems with collection
underperformance could be addressed with this tariff as well since it could be required
that customers be current on their bills to receive the benefit.

Designing a public communication campaign
The findings of the analysis discussed above should be embedded in a communication
campaign and should be discussed in various public forums. The government would need to
reach out to all stakeholders in a consultative process to make the case that subsidy reform is
broadly beneficial. The pillars of the campaign could be organized around the following themes:


Energy subsidies are a legacy of the past; they are expensive, inequitable, and
unaffordable. Due to a protracted lack of investment in the past 25 years, the system is

The installation of meters with control systems would help this effort by linking household payment to actual
consumption thus affecting financial incentives of households.

degraded and in urgent need of rehabilitation. Urgent reforms are necessary since there
aren’t sufficient financial resources for enhancements. About 60 percent of heat is currently
wasted, pointing to major potential savings if the necessary investment is put in place.
Energy subsidies are not a ‘free lunch’ for the population. If budgetary outlays on subsidies
are not reduced, either taxes or the budget deficit would be higher and would likely fall
disproportionally on households in the upper quintiles of the income distribution and those
who pay taxes, given the size of the grey economy.



The opportunity cost of subsidies is high in terms of foregone public investment and
underperforming economic growth. Foregone public investment means that the
government is spending less on higher priority public spending such as health, education
and infrastructure investment which in turn hampers economic growth and employment.
Capital expenditure is only a fraction of energy subsidies. It is also relatively low relative to
other transition countries and significantly lower than in dynamic emerging market
economies in Asia.



Almost half of the population will receive social assistance to protect it from the effects
of the reform. Identifying the most vulnerable is feasible, so this reform proposal can be
implemented quickly while also scaling up means-tested social assistance programs for the
poor. To the extent that GMI cannot be scaled up fast enough to protect those that are
deemed most vulnerable, heating assistance will be provided to them in the winter months.
The infrastructure for targeting and delivering social assistance and for monitoring the
performance of the system will be enhanced through awareness campaigns, improved
management of information systems, and improved procedures for approving applicants and
certifying eligibility.



Energy policy will be designed and implemented in a transparent manner. An automatic
price adjustment mechanism will need to be instituted and will be implemented by the

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

91

UKRAINE

National Commission for State Energy Regulation (NERC) and National Commission on the
Regulation of the Communal Services (NURC). Such a mechanism would need to be publicly
reviewed at predefined frequencies. While the existence of the regulators for energy and
heating is an important initial condition for energy reform, the challenge will be to enhance
their independence both financially and politically. Furthermore, the regulatory framework
would need to be changed so as to focus on regulating the rate of return to energy
providers. Finally, budgets would need to explicitly reflect the costs of energy subsidies in
order to create an appropriate environment for their elimination. Full integration in the
budget of quasi-fiscal subsidies would improve transparency and reduce fiscal risks.
While past reform attempts have not been successful, neighboring countries have also
grappled with similar energy challenges, and success stories can be tapped on. Energy
subsidies were tackled in Ukraine in the past but not in a comprehensive manner. To a great
extent this was due to powerful vested interests that resisted such reforms. In addition, there
was a lack of a broader energy strategy; less emphasis on EU integration; and lack of a clear
understanding by the general public of how expensive and unequally distributed such
subsidies were. Though energy subsidy reforms are a key challenge for the future, past
attempts have registered smaller successes that can positively contribute to future reform
efforts. For example, regulators are already in place in both the natural gas and heating
sectors. Ukraine’s acceptance to become a candidate for the Extractive Industry Transparency
Initiative (EITI) will contribute to enhancing transparency in the energy sector. Finally, there is
also a much deeper understanding of who the beneficiaries of energy subsidies are as well as
of Ukraine’s matrix of social assistance programs. Together with experiences from other
countries (experiences of Armenia and Moldova are presented in the box below), energy
subsidy reforms can be successfully implemented in Ukraine if there is a strong political will
as well as buy-in from various groups of society.

Box 1. Examples of Transition Countries Tackling Energy Subsidy Reforms
Armenia
 After gaining independence, Armenia significantly underpriced electricity (providing subsidies to the
tune of 11 percent of GDP). Early price adjustments did not completely eliminate quasi-fiscal
subsidies, and increasing gas prices led to an exacerbation of the problem. In 1999, Armenia
introduced a cash transfer program that replaced child and family allowances. This new program was
used as a mechanism to help beneficiaries maintain their real consumption in the face of higher
electricity bills. Continued efforts were made to increase the coverage of the cash transfer program.
In addition, one-off cash transfers were made to low-income households and households considered
at risk of struggling to cope with higher electricity prices.



Furthermore, the Global Partnership on Output-based Aid (GPOBA) and the World Bank funded a
scheme providing grants to poor households for individual heating solutions based on gas heaters
and in some cases boilers. The drawbacks from the Armenia experience were that tariff increases for
electricity caused some customers to switch to cheaper, often dirtier, fuel sources such as wood fuel
or natural gas, while many poor households were pushed to not heat at all.



Takeaways for Ukraine: GMI is critically important and could to be scaled up in coverage and benefit;
one-off cash transfers may be necessary.

Moldova
 Like in other transition countries, increases in Russian gas import prices prompted tariff increases and
overall reforms in the energy sector in Moldova. IMF and World Bank-supported programs were
instrumental in pushing reforms forward. Important reforms related to: (i) Parliament transferred the
responsibility for tariff setting from the municipal authorities to the energy regulator (ii) the energy
regulator raised energy tariffs to financial cost-recovery levels; (iii) the power to appoint the energy
regulator’s council of administration and approve its budget was transferred to Parliament.



To mitigate the impact of higher energy tariffs on the most vulnerable, the central government
provided support alongside the municipal assistance scheme as a bridge until the new targeted social
assistance system was fully deployed. Interesting steps taken on the social assistance front were the
improved capacity of social services and the continuous awareness campaigns to increase
applications and expand enrollment in the new means-tested social assistance program so as to more
quickly phase out the old category-based compensation system. Furthermore, the guaranteed
minimum income and the cold-month assistance were increased.



Finally, the Ministry of Labor and Social Protection allocated additional resources to strengthen its
capacity to promptly process applications for the cash transfer program in order to ensure adequate
access to social assistance. The main drawbacks of the reforms in Moldova have been the uneven
implementation, with heating arrears remaining a challenge and pressure from the municipality of
Chisinau to limit heating tariff increases.



Takeaways for Ukraine: NERC and NURC should be de facto independent with appointments of its
members done by Parliament rather than the President. Awareness campaigns can be put in place in
order to increase applications for GMI and/or housing utilities subsidies. Finally, the resources of the
Ministry of Social Protection may need to be re-assessed to ensure that it has the capacity to handle
a potentially much larger number of beneficiaries.

Annex IX. Boosting Potential Growth in Ukraine Through
Structural Reforms1
Structural reforms are critical for boosting growth potential in Ukraine and ensuring balanced and
sustained development in the medium term. We have identified areas of major structural
constraints, which impede private investment on the demand and supply side. Based on our
assessment and findings of the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, European
Union, World Bank and the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, we
recommend developing a medium-term structural reform strategy with clearly defined reform
priorities to ensure consistent and coherent approach in addressing major obstacles to growth.
In addition, we emphasize the importance of thorough implementation and execution of law and
regulations.
A challenging way ahead towards improving competitiveness and boosting economic
growth
The economic crisis exposed weaknesses of the Ukrainian economy, putting in question
sustainability of the country’s growth fundamentals. In 2000–07 Ukraine enjoyed an annual
growth of 7–7.5 percent on average, supported by favorable external environment and
commodity prices, capital inflows and rising productivity. At the outbreak of the crisis, a rapid
deterioration of external conditions and large capital outflows severely hit Ukraine. With the Fund
programs in place and a boost from one-off factors,2 the country temporarily succeeded in
restoring economic growth, only to face another recession starting from 2012:H2. Large twin
deficits, a monetary policy focused on defending an overvalued exchange rate and strong
dependence on commodity prices have left Ukraine vulnerable to shocks. In addition, the
unsustainable mix of policies has taken its toll on investment and productivity, thus adversely
affecting Ukraine’s growth potential.3
Structural reforms are critical if Ukraine is to enjoy a sustainable economic growth in
a medium and long term. Policy measures aimed at reducing domestic demand and restoring
macroeconomic stability, including by ensuring exchange rate flexibility, cutting fiscal deficit, and
addressing energy sector imbalances and inefficiencies are indispensible for reviving economic
growth in Ukraine. However, to revamp potential growth and ensure a balanced and sustained
development, the country needs to strengthen its economic fundamentals by addressing longstanding constrains to growth. To this aim, structural reforms directed towards enhancing

Our estimates show that Ukraine’s potential growth in the medium term, absent policy changes, might be some
3 percentage points lower then what the country could enjoy if it had a consistent and sustainable policy mix in
place and after having addressed major structural inefficiencies.

country’s competitiveness by unlocking private sector’s potential need to be put in place. These
reforms are also crucial for increasing Ukraine’s income per capita and for ensuring its steady
convergence to the income levels enjoyed by more developed regional peers.4 Ukraine’s success
will largely hinge on broad political support for reforms and their timely and thorough
implementation.5
Notwithstanding some progress made in improving structural indicators, further
enhancement is strongly needed. Ukraine was among economies recognized by the World
Bank as making the most improvement in the 2014 Doing Business (DB), which ranks countries
based on business regulations and their enforcement in small and medium-size companies over
their life cycle. The country advanced by 28 ranks to 112th place (out of 189 countries) in the
6
ease of doing business and from 50.97 to 58.44 in the distance to the “frontier,” with progress
highly concentrated on dealing with construction permits and registering property.
Improvements were made from a low base, and Ukraine continues to lag behind CESEE peers.
There is also a substantial variation in performance among DB categories which may point
towards important regulatory obstacles for investment.7 In another complex measure of
competitiveness—the 2013–2014 Global Competitiveness Index (GCI) of the World Economic
Forum(WEF), Ukraine’s overall rating deteriorated from 73 to 84 position (out of 148 countries),
right after a short-lived progress made in the 2011–2012 rating (Figure 1). In addition,
governance in Ukraine remains weak, as reflected in the World Bank Worldwide Governance
Indicators. Economic freedom continues to be severely repressed. In the 2013 Index of Economic
Freedom (IEF) of the Heritage Foundation, Ukraine was ranked 161st (out of 177 countries) and
was the only country among CESEE classified as having repressed economic freedom.
More decisive progress is also required in implementing recommendations of the Group of
the States against Corruption (GRECO), the Council of Europe anti-corruption monitoring
body. Based on the latest report (March 2013), only 14 out of the 25 recommendations were
implemented satisfactory or dealt with in a satisfactory manner (GRECO, 2013). In addition,
the 2012 Corruption Perception Index (CPI) of Transparency International in Ukraine was the

Ukraine’s track record reveals problems, heavily influenced by a political cycle, with consistent and coherent
implementation of structural reforms, which includes cases of backtracking on reforms. For more information see
staff reports on 2012 Article IV Consultation, Ex-Post Evaluation of Exceptional Access Under the 2008 and 2010
SBAs.

The ease of doing business ranking compares economies with one another (economies are ranked from 1 to
189); the distance to the “frontier” benchmarks economies against the “frontier” in regulatory practice, measuring
the absolute distance to the best performer for each indicator. The “frontier” represents the highest performance
observed for each of the indicators across all economies included in Doing Business. An economy’s distance to
frontier is measured on a scale from 0 to 100, where 0 represents the lowest performance and 100 the frontier.

highest among CESEE, confirming that corruption remains a serious issue in Ukraine (Figure 2).
Recently—as part of the efforts to meet requirements of the association agreement with the
EU—the authorities have undertaken measures to pass anti-corruption legislation and address
judicial weaknesses. In order to ensure a steady progress in reducing corruption, these efforts
need to continue in a decisive and comprehensive matter, with strong emphasis on
implementation and execution.

Identifying obstacles to growth and setting reform priorities
Growth diagnostic studies offer a useful and practical tool for identifying structural
constrains to growth and setting countries’ reform priorities. The growth diagnostics
proposed by Hausmann et al. (2005) provides a useful framework for identifying the most biding
constrains to growth. The framework underscores the importance of setting policy priorities
which are likely to provide “the biggest bang for the reform buck”, instead of offering a broad
“laundry list” of possible measures. The growth diagnostics approach aims at identifying which of
the determinants of economic growth (such as returns to investment, private appropriability of
returns or access to finance) are the major source of impediments to higher growth. As a next
step, economic distortions associated with these determinants are being analyzed in order to
reveal those, which removal is most likely to grant the largest positive effect on growth. The
findings can later be used to develop policy measures to adequately target major distortions in a
right sequence.
Demand and supply impediments to investment limit Ukraine’s growth potential. A general
analysis based on a decision tree as in Hausmann et al. (2005) reveals that growth in Ukraine is
kept low by “low return to economic activity” and “high cost of finance” (Table 1). Generally, welleducated labor force (although skill mismatches between labor demand and supply do exist),
large market size and geographical location remain Ukraine’s strengths. However, flaws in the
business climate, governance and infrastructure impede demand for investment. On the supply
side, investment is hindered by distortions in access to financing.

98

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

UKRAINE

The growth diagnostic analysis can largely benefit from competitiveness ratings and
business climate surveys. Studies that serve as a base for these ratings, including those of the
World Bank, World Economic Forum, EBRD, OECD or the Heritage Foundation, offer a good
platform for a cross-country comparison. Their diverse focus and degree of detail provide good
opportunity for using a combination of these studies to identify areas in which a country lags
behind its peers. This approach helps reduce possible limitations of a single rating (indicator). To
some extent, it also helps avoid drawing conclusions about country’s competitiveness and
business environment based solely on narrow-based or short-lived improvements (not followed
by a broader spectrum of required reforms). A heatmap comparing each country against its
regional peers may serve as a practical example of such an approach. When applied to CESEE, a
heatmap shows that Ukraine specifically lags behind regional peers in (i) institutions and
(ii) business and service regulation (Table 2). The country also compares unfavorably in openness
to trade and FDI, financial market rigidity, and in innovation.
A cross-country comparison of structural indicators uncovers major economic distortions
in Ukraine relative to CEESE peers. Structural deficiencies in institutions stem from three major
groups of distortions: (i) weak protection of property rights; (ii) corruption, low transparency of
government policies, and favoritism; and (iii) an inefficient legal system. Ukraine is thus missing
key basic ingredients of healthy business climate and good governance, which are essential for
everyday business activity, attracting private investment and for private sector development. In
addition, business and services regulations fail to promote competition and suffer from
bureaucratic procedures. Non-tariff and sector-specific restrictions are a drag on trade and inflow
of FDI and hurt Ukraine’s innovation potential. Vulnerabilities in the financial sector and an
underdeveloped equity market constitute major structural deficiencies effecting financing and, as
a result, restricting private investment from the supply side (Table 3).
The identified economic distortions are broadly in line with findings of the EBRD, EU, WB
and the OECD. Their reports8 enumerate weak institutions and the rule of law, and problems
with access to financing (including the underdeveloped financial sector) as major factors
adversely affecting investment in Ukraine and contributing to the existence of informal sector
and grey economy. Specifically, the reports underscore deficiencies in private sector
development stemming from: (i) corruption and favoritism in government decisions; (ii) poor
implementation and law enforcement; (iii) lack of regulatory transparency and frequent changes
in legislation; and (iv) inefficient justice system. In addition, trade distorting measures, unstable
public procurement rules, the-still-existing delays in VAT refunds, and incidence of illegal
corporate raids are considered to be obstacles in attracting investment. On sector-specific issues,
the studies conclude that corrective measures should be directed towards addressing the longstanding inefficiencies in the gas and energy sectors, restoring healthy intermediation in financial
sector and improving competitiveness in the agricultural sector.

A way forward—boosting efficiency of the economy and unlocking growth potential
In order to unlock growth potential and ensure steady convergence to the best performers
among CESEE Ukraine needs to overhaul its macropolicy mix and put in place a coherent
medium-term structural reform strategy. Correcting existing imbalances and restoring
macroeconomic stability in line with staff advice is critical, but structural reforms cannot be put
on hold. The country has reached the efficiency-led stage of development, which is the second
out of three (factor-driven, efficiency-driven and innovation-driven) stages of development,
according to X. Sala-i-Martin and E. Artadi (2004). A growth strategy based on cost advantage
will no longer suffice, and emphasis needs to be put on efficiency-driven growth and on
9
innovation. Therefore, a medium-term structural reform strategy would work to Ukraine’s
benefit and ensure a consistent and comprehensive approach in targeting and removing major
obstacles to growth. To this aim, this strategy should include (i) clearly defined reform priorities;
(ii) specific timeline for their implementation, with due regard to appropriate sequencing; and
(iii) adequate implementation, execution and monitoring mechanisms.

2. Cost of finance

1.1. Social returns (i.e., low investment in complementary to
capital factors of production)

2.1. International finance - volatile; access to foreign capital
largely depends on macroeconomic stability, authorities'
willingness to conduct reforms and on global risk perception;
sometimes ease of access to foreign capital (investors' profit
seeking) may mask the urgency for reforms;

Geography – strategic location, large market size, but
discrepancies between east and west (industrial development
concentrated in the eastern part);
Human capital – solid education, but existing skill
mismatches between labor demand and supply;
Infrastructure – underprovision and weaknesses in
infrastructure, specyfically in transport, logistic and energy;
1.2. Appropriability
-

government failures:

(i) micro risks: weaknessess in governance and the rule of
law; poor property rights and contract enforcement;
corruption ; room to improve competition;

2.2. Local finance
- domestic saving - below CEESE average (since 2009);
a downward trend in domestic savings to GDP ratio;
- intermediation – vulnerabilities in the financial sector;
underdeveloped equity market;

(ii) macro risks: high vulnerabilities, external imbalances,
inconsistent policy mix;
market failures (information and coordination externalities
leading to sub-optimal investment): underperformance in
export diversification and sophistication, weaknesses in
technology absorption and innovation;

Reform priorities need to be defined based on their impact on growth. They should also
guarantee broad-based improvements to ensure that obstacles to investment on different levels
and in different dimensions are addressed. Having a strategy designed and executed from
a growth perspective would also help avoid a trap of targeting structural indicators that offer
only narrow-based advances in competitiveness ratings without effectively addressing major
economic distortion adversely influencing investment activity. Such a strategy could build on the
President’s Reform Program for 2010–14, which currently shapes the structural reform agenda
in Ukraine. The starting point for defining reform priorities should, however, be their re-focusing
on broad-based benefits to growth in the medium term.
Given the broad scope of structural deficiencies in Ukraine, reform priorities should
simultaneously address impediments to investment on the demand and supply side.
An emphasis needs to be equally put on creation of a solid legal framework, efficient
implementation of regulations, and the execution of law. In particular, it will be essential to
strengthen the judicial system, simplify or repeal burdensome government regulations, step-up
anti-corruption measures, including by enhancing the anti-money laundering (AML) framework,

and strengthen the financial system. The following specific reform priorities would be
recommended based on staff’s analysis and recommendations of the EBRD, EU, WB and OECD:

continue to reform the justice system to improve its efficiency and
governance and ensure fair resolution of commercial disputes;
establish an independent business ombudsman, as recommended
by a number of business organizations and IFIs, to respond to
concerns about unfair business practices and advocate swift action
to resolve such concerns;
strengthen administrative, judicial and operational enforcement
capacity to protect property rights;
avoid frequent changes in regulations, reduce delays in issuing
regulations and ensure their effective implementation (avoid
administrative discretion);
enhance implementation and law enforcement;
reduce frequency and fragmented changes to public procurement
law; establish a monitoring system to ensure proper
implementation of public procurement;
streamline administrative procedures in licensing and business
permits;
continue to address delays in VAT refunds through conventional
measures;
impose clear and consistent rules in tax administration;
make the recently reformed corporate insolvency framework
operational;
remove the remaining foreign investment and trade restrictions in
line with WTO commitments;
ensure thorough implementation of the Custom Code;
fully implement the 2008 FSAP recommendations and
recommendations of the 2013 Article IV report, including
strengthen the overall legal, regulatory, and supervisory
framework, and remove obstacles to capital market development;
ensure consistent implementation and enforcement of supervision
on consolidated basis, bank resolution framework, and of the law
on disclosure of ultimate beneficiary owners.

In addition to the above-mentioned priorities, sector-specific policy measures, particularly in the
gas and energy sector, would be beneficial for boosting economic growth in Ukraine. However,
reforms in these areas are beyond the scope of our analysis presented in this note.

Exchange Arrangements:
In September 1996, the authorities introduced the hryvnia (UAH) at a conversion rate with the
previous currency karbovanets (Krb) of KrB 100,000 to UAH 1. The NBU influences the exchange rate
without announcing a specific path or exchange rate target by intervening in the interbank foreign
exchange market, applying foreign exchange regulations and controls, and through moral suasion.
Since 2009 the official exchange rate has remained close to UAH 8.0 per U.S. dollar, and from
July 2012 it has been fixed at 7.993 UAH/USD. The average-weighed interbank market rate for
U.S. dollar, as calculated by the NBU, did not deviate by more than 2 percent from the official NBU

UKRAINE

rate since September 2009 (but interbank or cash exchange rates quoted by market sources often
exceeded this threshold). Effective February 2, 2009, the classification of the de facto exchange rate
arrangement was changed from managed floating with no predetermined path for the exchange
rate to other managed arrangement, retroactively to April 30, 2008, due to the revision of the
classification methodology. Since March 1, 2010 it has been classified as stabilized arrangement.
Meanwhile, the NBU has been developing a more robust monetary policy framework focused on
domestic price stability with greater exchange rate flexibility. A transition to a free floating exchange
rate is planned when the financial system recovers and the transmission mechanisms mature.
On September 24, 1996, Ukraine accepted the obligations of Article VIII, Sections 2, 3, and 4 of the
Fund’s Articles of Agreement. Ukraine currently maintains two multiple currency practices arising
from (i) the use of the official exchange rate for certain government transactions; and (ii) the
requirement that a Ukrainian resident who sells the previously purchased foreign exchange not used
within 10 days (including when FX was returned to the resident because the counterpart failed to
fulfill its obligations under an import contract) shall transfer 100 percent of the positive difference
from the sale price, on a quarterly basis, to the State budget.
FSAP Participation:
A joint World Bank–International Monetary Fund mission conducted an assessment of Ukraine
financial sector as part of the Financial Sector Assessment Program (FSAP) in 2003, and the Financial
Sector Stability Assessment (FSSA) report (IMF Country Report No. 03/340) was considered by the
Executive Board on May 14, 2003. The observance of the following standards and codes was
assessed: Basel Core Principles for Effective Banking Supervision; Code of Good Practices on
Transparency in Monetary and Financial Policies; CPSS Core Principles for Systemically Important
Payment Systems; OECD Principles for Corporate Governance; Accounting and Auditing Practices;
World Bank’s Principles and Guidelines for Effective Insolvency and Creditor Rights System; and
AML/CFT Methodology.
An FSAP update was undertaken in 2007. The observance of the following standards and codes was
assessed: Basel Core Principles for Effective Banking Supervision; and IOSCO Core Principles of
Securities Regulation. A Financial Sector Stability Assessment (FSSA) was considered by the
Executive Board as part of the 2008 Article IV consultation.
The next FSAP for Ukraine has been scheduled for the second half of 2014 prior to the 2014 Article
IV consultation.
ROSCS
A Data ROSC Module was conducted in April 3–17, 2002, and was considered by the Executive Board
on August 5, 2003 (IMF Country Report No. 03/256). A Fiscal Transparency Module (experimental)
was issued in September 1999, and an update in April 2004 (IMF Country Report No. 04/98).

Safeguards Assessments:
The most recent safeguards assessment of the NBU was completed on February 1, 2011. The
assessment found that the NBU has strengthened its safeguards framework since the 2008
assessment by implementing the majority of the related recommendations. However, the deferred
implementation of some provisions under the new NBU law enacted in 2010 weakens its
effectiveness. The assessment also found that new financial risks have emerged because of special
legislation and resolutions impairing the NBU’s autonomy. Steps are being taken to address these
issues, including with the approval of a law repealing the requirement that bank recapitalization
bonds are subject to mandatory repurchase at their face value by the NBU.
UFR/Article IV Consultation:
Ukraine is on a 12-month consultation cycle. The last Article IV consultation was concluded on
June 29, 2012 and a report was published on our external website: www.imf.org.

RELATIONS WITH THE WORLD BANK
(October 2013)
Country Partnership Strategy
The World Bank Group’s Country Partnership Strategy (CPS, 2012-16) was discussed by the Board of
Directors on February 16, 2012. The CPS aims to assist Ukraine in overcoming implementation
bottlenecks identified in the Presidential Program and thus help make progress in the ambitious
reform and EU integration agenda. The World Bank Group will adjust its policy dialogue, lending,
investment, and technical assistance to respond to the government’s demonstrated commitment.
The CPS is organized around two pillars, both emphasizing importance of improved governance.
Pillar I supports relations between government and citizens, focused on improving public services,
sustainability and efficiency of public finances, and a more transparent and accountable use of
public resources. Pillar II supports productive cooperation between government and business by
focusing on growth, competitiveness and job creation, improvements in business climate, promotion
of domestic and foreign direct investments to achieve productivity improvements, and channeling
public investment into critical public infrastructure.
The World Bank Group's assistance to Ukraine in the new CPS will be calibrated to match the scope
and instruments of support to the strength of the authorities' commitment, capacity and trackrecord in key areas of potential engagement. Specifically, investment loans will be offered where
governance risks are manageable, where a track record of implementation has been established and
capacity built and where there is broad consensus on general policy framework. Analytical and
advisory services will be offered to help strengthen reform consensus and build capacity.
Development policy lending will be contingent on a sustainable macroeconomic framework and
progress in tackling key governance weaknesses.
World Bank Program
The current investment lending portfolio includes nine operations totaling US$ 1.9 billion, of which
almost 50 percent has been disbursed. Among the projects in the public sector are a Public Finance
Modernization Project (US$50 million) and a Statistical System Modernization Project
(US$42 million). The Hydropower Rehabilitation Project and additional financing (US$166.0 million)
were approved in June 2005 and November 2009, respectively, and the Power Transmission Project
(US$200 million) was approved in August 2007. The Board approved an Energy Efficiency Project
(US$200 million) in 2011. In infrastructure, the Bank’s Board approved a Roads and Safety
Improvement project in 2009 for US$400 million and Second Roads and Safety Improvement Project
for US$450 million in 2012 (both currently under implementation). The Bank also has an Urban
Infrastructure Project (US$140 million), designed to provide financing to local governments and
utilities for priority investments in water and wastewater. In the financial sector, the Second Export

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

5

UKRAINE

Development Project (EDP2; US$154 million plus additional financing of US$150 million), which
builds on the success of the first project, promotes the export sector access to finance.
The investment lending program for the first two years of the CPS envisages base level support in
the range of US$500 million per annum. The current investment lending pipeline for FY14 includes
an operation to support scaling up targeted social assistance, a second Urban Infrastructure project
and a District Heating Energy Efficiency Project for a total of US$850 million, which may change
based on the government’s demand and the Bank’s lending capacity. In FY15–16, additional
investment lending may be envisaged in the following areas: (i) transport and trade facilitation;
(ii) energy efficiency and energy security; (iii) municipal services and governance; (iv) health services
and financing; and (v) private sector development and access to financing.
The calibrated engagement leaves room for an upward revision of lending amounts through
Development Policy Lending (DPL) should reforms accelerate and consistent progress on
governance be made. The Programmatic Financial Sector DPL series and cross-sector DPL series
supporting improved economic governance and competitiveness could be launched subject to the
government's request for IBRD resources, a sustainable macroeconomic framework, tangible
progress on governance/structural issues, IBRD's financial capacity, and global economic
developments.
All areas of engagement will build on strong diagnostic work and technical assistance, with focus on
building consensus in society regarding policies and processes to tackle key structural challenges.
Main areas for analytical and advisory assistance (AAA) will be: (i) the investment climate, including
advice in key policy areas such as agriculture, land, business regulations; (ii) fiscal, tax and PFM;
(iii) energy efficiency and governance (including gas sector modernization); (iv) financial sector
stability and development; (v) municipal governance and service delivery; (vi) social reforms
(targeted social assistance and pension reform); and (vii) health sector reforms. Partnerships in policy
dialogue and AAA with the European Commission (EC), the International Monetary Fund (IMF),
United Stated Agency for International Development (USAID), European Bank for Reconstruction
and Development (EBRD) and other bilateral donors will continue and be expanded where possible.

Bank-Fund Collaboration
According to Joint Management Action Plan on Fund-Bank collaboration on Ukraine, the staff
teams agreed that the Fund and Bank would support Ukraine’s efforts to: (i) pursue fiscal
consolidation whilst finding fiscal space to increase public investments needed to support private
sector growth and to tackle pressing social issues; (ii) move forward with energy sector and utility
tariff reforms whilst protecting the poor; (iii) complete rehabilitation and strengthen oversight of the
banking system; (iv) strengthen the monetary policy framework; and (v) improve the investment
climate. The teams agreed to the following division of labor and coordination:


Restoring confidence and fiscal sustainability: Strengthening public finances and tackling
long-standing problems through advancing structural reforms would underpin medium-term
fiscal sustainability and growth. The Fund program and the Bank’s assistance are designed to
support the authorities’ efforts to lower budget deficits and to: (i) tackle key budgetary rigidities
to gradually reduce the footprint of the public sector on the economy; and (ii) support
reallocation of resources from transfers and other current spending toward growth-enhancing
capital investments and better targeted social support. To this end, the Bank, in coordination
with the Fund, has recommended a series of structural measures to reform the pension system.
The Fund and Bank teams work closely through their programs to push the implementation of a
sequence of reforms aimed at putting the pension system on sound financial footing and
reducing its strain on public finances. In the context of administrative reforms in Ukraine, the
Bank and Fund will continue to provide advice aimed at ensuring a leaner and more efficient
public service. The Bank will continue to provide project financing for the public sector, including
a Public Finance Modernization Project, a Statistical System Modernization Project, and the
ongoing investments to modernize social assistance services. The Bank also plans to focus on
improving the efficiency of public spending. The Bank and Fund will also coordinate on
supporting the authorities’ efforts to strengthen debt management.



eliminating the need for budgetary support to Naftogaz, and encouraging investment in gas
exploration, extraction, and transportation. The Bank’s support for the authorities’ energy sector
reforms will continue to focus on infrastructure modernization through a sequence of
investment loans, including in areas of hydropower rehabilitation, power and gas transmission,
and energy efficiency. The Fund will focus on supporting efforts to phase out Naftogaz’s deficit,
including through a program of steady gas prices and utility tariff increases to advance cost
recovery and reduce fiscal and quasi-fiscal deficits generated by the company. The Bank and the
Fund will continue to work together on supporting reforms that depoliticize price-setting
mechanisms of public utilities and improve payment discipline. To improve transparency of
reporting in the gas sector, the Bank will support and advise the authorities on Extractive
Industries Transparency Initiative. The Bank team will continue its advice on improving targeting
of social assistance to protect poor households from higher utility tariffs and other necessary
fiscal reforms. The Bank and Fund teams will work closely to support implementation of this
reform agenda.


Preserving banking sector stability while deepening financial intermediation: In light of
macroeconomic risks, preserving stability of the banking system and deepening healthy financial
intermediation are key policy priorities in the financial sector. The Fund and the Bank will
continue to coordinate closely in advising the National Bank of Ukraine on improving the
regulatory and institutional supervisory framework aimed at making Ukrainian banking system
more resilient to shocks. The Fund and the Bank will also provide well-coordinated policy advice
and technical assistance to the authorities on strengthening the crisis preparedness framework,
including analysis of evolving risks, preparation of contingency plans for the system and specific
institutions, and enhancing resolution tools. The teams will also work closely on supporting
further development of a framework that recognizes and facilitates resolution of impaired loans,
including development of a strategy to pro-actively address barriers to nonperforming loans’
effective resolution and any necessary changes to the existing legislation and regulations,
including tax treatment. The Bank will continue its technical assistance to other financial sector
regulators on select issues in improving the regulatory and supervisory regime for non-bank
financial institutions.



Developing a more robust monetary policy framework: Focusing monetary policy squarely
on domestic price stability with greater exchange rate flexibility under a more independent NBU
will facilitate inflation reduction, discourage dollarization and excessive risk-taking, and provide
a buffer against frequent external shocks. The Fund will lead in this area, including through
policy advice, and also by providing technical assistance on strengthening monetary policy and
operations frameworks and establishing necessary preconditions for moving toward inflation
targeting regime over the medium term. The Fund will continue to provide technical assistance
as needed for implementing the authorities’ strategy for liberalization of the foreign currency
market. It will also work with the authorities as needed on addressing remaining shortcomings in
the governance of the NBU identified in the context of the recent Safeguards Assessment.



Improving investment climate: Deep and sustained improvements of the business
environment are key for generating strong and sustained economic growth fueled by private
sector. In support of this objective, the Bank Group will lead in this area supporting measures
and reforms to reduce entry and exit barriers to enable creation of new businesses and to allow
a faster reallocation of resources in the economy. The Bank would also support measures to
improve fair competition and to overcome governance and regulatory barriers to trade and FDI.
The Fund will provide support for the authorities’ efforts as appropriate.

RELATIONS WITH THE EUROPEAN BANK FOR
RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
(November 2013)
Since Ukraine joined the EBRD in 1992, the Bank has been active in supporting the country’s
transformation towards market economy. As of end-October 2013 the EBRD’s portfolio in Ukraine
reached €4.8 billion (with 2013 signings of €630 million) with most of it being in the private sector.
The Bank’s country exposure in Ukraine is its second largest after Russia, accounting for
approximately 1/8th of the Bank’s overall portfolio. The portfolio represents roughly an equal
exposure across the Bank’s three main industry sectors: Industry & Commerce, Financial Institutions
and Energy & Infrastructure. The EBRD’s focus in Ukraine is to achieve a transition impact through
funding of projects (debt and equity) in both private and public sectors. This has been supported by
a range of technical cooperation and policy dialogue.
During the financial crisis of 2008–09, the EBRD pursued a country specific crisis response program
for Ukraine in coordination with various stakeholders, including the authorities, other IFIs and
international donors. In 2009, despite the increased country risk, the EBRD invested €1.1 billion in
Ukraine, a record level for the country. Almost two-thirds of the total amount was invested in the
banking sector to help support stability and confidence. During the crisis, the EBRD also undertook a
complete reassessment of business needs in the corporate sector, which suffered from a terms-oftrade shock and financial sector de-leveraging, which resulted in investments of over €250 million
in 2009. A further €220 million was invested in the infrastructure and energy sectors. During 2010
and 2011 total investments remained at roughly €1.1 billion, but were more equally balanced across
the Bank’s main sectors. Starting from 2012, however, the Bank has noticed a marked decline in the
demand for development loans—particularly in the nonagribusiness corporate sector—due, in a
large part, to the deteriorating investment climate. In response, the Bank has become increasingly
involved in coordinating key players (including the IMF) to address corruption and unfair business
practices in Ukraine as a key policy initiative to improve the business climate
The Bank’s country strategy for 2011–14 was approved in April 2011. It focuses on addressing
Ukraine’s important transition challenges in all key sectors, including (i) sustainable energy through
energy efficiency and renewable energy, as well as on energy security; (ii) unlocking Ukraine’s
agricultural and industrial potential; (iii) providing good quality and reliable infrastructure; and
(iv) dealing with the legacy of the crisis in the financial sector. The Bank is currently working on the
country strategy for 2014–18.
The Bank has also been active in developing the local private sector and encouraging inflows of FDIs
and it has also supported a number of medium and large local clients, including Nibulon, MHP,
Ukrplastic and Lugzentrokuz. Small and medium-size enterprises have been reached via credit lines
offered to them via partner banks. The Bank has actively participated in financing several leading

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

UKRAINE

international investors (including Lafarge, Air Liquide, Multi Developments and Louis Dreyfus) and
cross-border transactions with sponsors from other countries of operation.
The EBRD has continued its support to SMEs through its Small Business Support program (SBS)
through advice and mentoring at the enterprise level and development of a sustainable
infrastructure in the country for business advisory services. In May 2010 the Bank rolled out in
Ukraine its hallmark Business Advisory Services (BAS) Programme, which supported nearly 200 small
and medium-size enterprises to improve production quality and market performance, business
processes and organizational structures. International operational and technical know-how has also
been made available to Ukrainian SMEs through the Enterprise Growth Programme (EGP).
Manufacturing companies with high value added benefited from international expertise bringing
improvements in corporate governance, business transparency and corporate social responsibility.
The Bank may consider further expansion of its advisory services in Ukraine’s regions.
The EBRD has been actively working with the government of Ukraine to enable the Bank and other
IFI’s to provide loans denominated in Hryvna. On July 30 2013, President Yanukovych signed a law
that allows the EBRD, the International Finance Corporation and other international financial
institutions to issue bonds in Hryvna through which the IFI’s can fund their local currency lending,
particularly for the SME and municipal borrowers. Parliament had adopted relevant amendments to
the law on securities and the stock market on July 4, 2013. Operating regulations guiding the
implementation of the law still need to be issued by appropriate financial sector regulators in
Ukraine in order to allow the EBRD to actually issue locally.
The EBRD has also been working with the Ukrainian authorities to develop new derivatives
legislation which would allow hedging of foreign exchange risk and enable swap transactions and
introduce important concepts, such as netting and close-out netting. The final draft is now with the
Cabinet of Ministers, and the EBRD is largely satisfied with its content. The next step will be the
submission of the draft to the Rada for adoption.
In the Agribusiness sector the Bank has been actively involved in policy dialogue in grain sector;
promoting greater transparency and predictability of policy interventions and better policy making
and coordination between the government and the private sector. Two round tables involving public
and private sector stakeholders were organized and resulted in a creation of a working group, which
was instrumental in advising the government that grain export quotas deter much needed
investments into the sector. The EBRD would like to build on this positive experience in the grain
sector and is looking at possibilities of supporting efforts to launch policy dialogue in the dairy
sector between the key dairy market regulators and the industry.
The Bank continues to pursue its strategic goal of supporting sustainable development in respect of
environment, natural resources and energy. Together with other IFIs, the EBRD continues to explore
mechanisms for supporting the authorities as they pursue modernization of the Ukraine’s gas transit
system and implementation of the March 2009 EU-Ukraine memorandum of understanding, which is
the cornerstone of EU-Ukraine cooperation in the field of energy. In particular, the Bank is assisting

12

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

UKRAINE

with the modernization and rehabilitation of the main trans-European energy networks of Ukraine
and investments in modern and energy efficient generation, transportation and distribution of
energy. These aims are complemented by a support to reforms in the energy sector to advance its
liberalization and promote private sector involvement. In addition, the Bank is actively supporting
diversification of supply sources and promoting alternative fuels and development of renewable
energy sector in Ukraine—having signed five private deals (solar, wind, biomass) for the total
amount of €54 million over the last year alone—and in natural resources, the Bank extended
USD 70 million loan to Coal Energy, a private independent Ukrainian coal producer, which was the
first project for the Bank in Ukraine that includes investment in coal mining along with strong health
and safety and energy efficiency components.
In the area of nuclear safety, the Bank is working to improve the safety standards at the existing
nuclear power plants and in 2013 signed a €300 million Nuclear Safety sovereign loan with
Energoatom as part of a major €1 billion project to be co-financed by Euroatom, the safe
decommissioning of Chernobyl NPP and the creation of a safe confinement for its Unit 4.
In the municipal sector the Bank signed four loans for a total amount of €50 million during 2012–
2013 with Ukrainian municipal utilities for the upgrade and modernization of district heating and
water systems. These represent the first loans under municipal but without sovereign guarantees,
following the amendment of the budget framework promoted by the Bank which removed critical
hurdles in the financing of municipal investment projects by means of lending under municipal
guarantees. The projects will benefit from a substantial grant co-financing of €25 million from E5P
Fund and Swedish SIDA. Further, in the municipal sector the Bank provided a €152 million sovereign
loan to finance Dnipropetrovsk Metro completion project, which is to be co-financed by the
European Investment Bank. The EBRD has a strong pipeline of municipal projects, first of all in the
district heating sector, where the country has a huge potential for efficiency improvements, but the
scope of further investments will largely depend on progress with the tariff reform.
In transport, the Bank continued to promote commercialization of major state operators providing
two nonsovereign loans for a total amount of €99 million to the national railways for renewal of the
freight rolling stock and to the air navigation service provider for the system modernization. In
addition, the Bank continued financing of the rehabilitation of the main pan-European road
corridors and supporting independent private transport companies.

STATISTICAL ISSUES
(November 2013)
I. Assessment of Data Adequacy for Surveillance
General: Data provision has some shortcomings, but is broadly adequate for surveillance.
Among Ukraine’s economic and financial data, there are some shortcomings, particularly in
national accounts, government finance statistics (GFS), and external sector statistics.
National Accounts: The National Accounts (NA) are broadly in line with the 1993 SNA. An STA
multitopic technical assistance mission in April 2010 flagged financial account, sector balance
sheets and estimates of financial intermediation services indirectly measured, as the parts of the
system that remain to be developed. In line with previous recommendations, a number of
changes were implemented in 2009–10 that improved compilation of the quarterly national
accounts (QNA). Volume measures of GDP have been rebased using 2007 as the reference period
but a number of recommended methodological improvements remain to be implemented. There
is room to increase the State Statistics Committee of Ukraine’s independence from the
government in its ability to improve data accuracy through flexible revisions for the annual NA
and the QNA. Starting from 2011, Ukraine is one of the beneficiaries of the STA TA project on
Capacity Building for Sustainable Compilation of Real Sector Statistics in Eastern Europe. As part of
this project, officials of the State Statistics Service (SSS) participated in three workshops on
national accounts/price statistics. In addition, the SSS requested assistance for implementation of
the System of National Accounts 2008, and a TA mission is expected to visit Ukraine during the
first quarter of 2014.
Price statistics: The weights of CPI are updated annually; geometric means are used at the very
first level of price aggregation (beginning with January 2010 observations) and scientific
sampling of outlets was introduced beginning with January 2011 observations, with the results
being published within six days of the end of the reference month. The geographical coverage is
limited to urban areas. The CPI excludes price changes for owner occupied housing.
Government finance statistics: Compilers are cognizant of the GFSM 2001 methodology and
reference materials. However, the lack of a strong legal framework for compiling GFS and its
incomplete statistical coverage are significant shortcomings. The full adoption of the GFSM 2001
system depends on strengthening of primary data sources, government accounting reform
(undertaken under the International Public Sector Accounting Standards), and successful
completion of the GFS component of the World Bank project on the development of statistics. A
lack of clarity on the stock of VAT refund claims prevents a full assessment of the underlying
fiscal performance.
Monetary statistics: Since September 2006, the NBU uses the Standardized Report Forms (SRF)
for reporting monetary data to STA and EUR. Data for December 2001–August 2006 have also
been converted into the SRFs and used as the basis for publication of monetary statistics in
the IFS.

14

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

UKRAINE

External Sector: The compilation system relies heavily on the International Transactions
Reporting System, customs declaration database, and enterprise surveys, providing a broad
coverage of data on a timely basis. Nevertheless, direct data collection through enterprise
surveys and a more intensive use of available data sources would improve data quality in the
areas of financial services, travel, compensation of employees, workers’ remittances, and
reinvested earnings. Goods statistics could benefit by improving the methodology for estimating
the c.i.f./f.o.b. conversion coefficient as well as by bringing reporting forms and instructions in
line with the international guidelines. Efforts are also needed to reconcile direct investment data
provided by the survey enterprises and ITRS, and to determine the sources of large FX cash held
outside of the banking system classified under currency and deposits. In line with 2012 STA TA,
improvements are needed regarding direct investment by improving the coverage of debt
instruments data and the valuation of equity.
II. Data Standards and Quality
Participant in the SDDS since January 10, 2003.

Data ROSC published on August 19, 2003.

III. Reporting to STA
The country’s IFS page has been published since July 1996. On monetary statistics, data have
been published since September 2006 using the SRF framework in the IFS and are available
online. The authorities also report regularly the quarterly data on Financial Soundness Indicators.
These data are disseminated on the IMF’s website with observations beginning in 2005. Data on
international investment position has been compiled and reported since 2002.

Statement by the IMF Staff Representative
December 16, 2013

1.
This statement provides information that has become available since the staff
report for the Article IV consultation and the first Post-Program Monitoring was
circulated to the Executive Board. This information does not alter the thrust of the staff
appraisal.
2.
Recent macroeconomic data came broadly in line with staff projections. Gross
output in agriculture expanded by 43 percent y-o-y in October, supporting expectations that
the economy may be gradually emerging out of the recession. The pace of decline in
industrial production slowed as well, to -4.9 percent y-o-y from -5.6 percent in September.
However, the state-owned energy company Naftogaz continued to accumulate liabilities to
Gazprom for unpaid gas imports (about US$2 billion as of end-November), the settlement of
which the authorities are seeking to defer to 2014.
3.
The decision not to sign the Association Agreement with the EU last month led to
mass protests and a political crisis which persists, despite the government’s survival of a
no-confidence vote on December 3. The authorities reaffirmed their aspiration for EU
integration, and a Ukrainian delegation is going to Brussels to discuss aspects of the
implementation of the association and free trade agreement with the EU. At the same time,
the authorities have been reportedly seeking external financing from Russia and China.
Under the current circumstances, the content of the 2014 budget and the timing of its
adoption remain uncertain.
4.
Markets have reacted negatively to the recent events with Ukraine’s Eurobond
yields and CDS spreads widening sharply to multi-year highs. The National Bank of
Ukraine (NBU) gross reserves declined to US$18.8 billion at end-November (about
2.2 months of import coverage). So far, the exchange rate has remained broadly stable,
supported by NBU interventions, and the commercial banks report only a small uptick in
household deposit withdrawals. However, the demand-supply imbalance in the foreign
exchange market persists, raising the risk of market-forced exchange rate adjustment in case
of intensified pressures.

Press Release No. 13/531
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
December 19, 2013

International Monetary Fund
700 19th Street, NW
Washington, D. C. 20431 USA

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2013 Article IV Consultation, First Post-Program
Monitoring, and Ex Post Evaluation of Exceptional Access with Ukraine
On December 16, 2013, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF)
concluded the 2013 Article IV consultation and the first Post Program Monitoring Review, as
well as the Ex Post Evaluation of Exceptional Access under the 2010 Stand-By Arrangement
with Ukraine.1
The Ukrainian economy has been in recession since mid-2012, and the outlook remains
challenging. In January–September 2013 GDP contracted by 1¼ percent y-o-y, reflecting lower
demand for Ukrainian exports and falling investments. Consumer prices stayed flat, held down
by decreasing food prices and tight monetary policy. Weak external demand and impaired
competitiveness kept the trailing 12-month current account deficit elevated at about 8 percent of
GDP by end-September despite a significant reduction in natural gas imports. The high current
account deficit amid less favorable international market environment pressured international
reserves, which fell below the equivalent of 2½ months of imports by end-October 2013. Under
currently planned policies, modest growth should return in 2014, driven by improvements in
external demand, strong grain exports, and continuing consumption expansion. However, this
outlook is subject to significant risks, emanating from the inconsistent policy mix and heightened
political and economic uncertainty in recent weeks.
The fiscal stance loosened in 2012–13, contributing to the buildup of vulnerabilities. Large
pension and wage increases, generous energy subsidies, and soccer cup spending led to a
widening of the combined deficit of the general government and the state-owned company
Naftogaz to 5½ percent of GDP in 2012. In 2013, the combined government-Naftogaz deficit is
projected to expand to 7¾ percent of GDP.

1

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with members, usually
every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial information, and discusses with officials
the country's economic developments and policies. On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which
forms the basis for discussion by the Executive Board.

2
An inefficient and opaque energy sector continues to weigh heavily on public finances and the
economy. Overall energy subsidies in Ukraine reached about 7½ percent of GDP in 2012. The
very low tariffs for residential gas and district heating cover only a fraction of economic costs
and encourage one of the highest energy consumption levels in Europe. As a result, Naftogaz’s
losses in 2013:H1 more than doubled and the company is late on payments for imported gas.
Tight monetary policy in 2012–13 focused on defending exchange rate stability while
accommodating the expanding fiscal deficit. In part reflecting deficit monetization, base money
increased by nearly 15 percent in the year to September 2013. To ensure steady supply of foreign
exchange to the market, the authorities tightened foreign exchange regulations and controls,
which increased transactions costs in the economy.
The banking system appears stable at present, but vulnerabilities persist. A high average capital
adequacy ratio of 18 percent provides some cushion against risks stemming from an elevated
non-performing loan ratio of 14 percent. High interest rates offered by banks induced a more
than 30 percent increase in hryvnia deposits in the year to November, while credit to the
economy expanded only modestly, constraining economic activity.
Ukraine remains current on all its payments to the Fund, and the authorities have reaffirmed their
commitment to repay all outstanding Fund credit. On the obligation basis, outstanding Fund
credit to Ukraine would decline below 200 percent of quota by February 2014 and below
100 percent of quota by September 2014.
In accordance with IMF procedures for arrangements entailing exceptional access, the Executive
Board discussed an ex-post evaluation (EPE) of Ukraine’s experience under the Stand-By
Arrangement (SBA) approved in July 2010. The EPE finds that the SBA-supported program was
appropriately designed to address Ukraine’s most important vulnerabilities, and delivered some
notable achievements, including the passage of pension reform in 2011. However, the program
quickly went off-track as the authorities stopped implementing the agreed policies, reflecting
insufficient ownership. The same issues that had derailed previous programs in Ukraine hindered
the completion of the 2010 SBA, particularly the reluctance to sufficiently adjust energy prices
and increase exchange rate flexibility.
The EPE draws several lessons for future IMF engagement with Ukraine and other countries
from the experience of the 2010 program. First, exceptional access and long-duration
arrangements may be too ambitious in countries with low program policy ownership;
arrangements with lower access focused on critical areas may have better prospects of success.
Second, a mechanism to terminate off-track arrangements could be useful in designing future
IMF programs, especially when program ownership is an issue. Finally, prior actions continue to
be a powerful tool for implementing program policies, as they were responsible for the majority
of the achievements under the 2010 SBA.

Executive Board Assessment2
Executive Directors noted that, despite the Ukrainian authorities’ efforts to maintain
macroeconomic stability amid worsening economic conditions, the current macroeconomic
policy mix has generated large external and fiscal imbalances and has contributed to deepening
the recession. Directors recommended the authorities implement a package of comprehensive
policy adjustments in several areas, including curtailing the fiscal and external current account
deficits, phasing out energy subsidies, strengthening the banking sector, and improving the
external competitiveness of the economy.
Directors concurred that the overvalued exchange rate has contributed to a widening external
current deficit, loss of competitiveness, and steady depletion of international reserves. At the
same time, a tight monetary policy, focused on defending exchange rate stability and based on
the extensive use of administrative controls, has stifled growth. Against this background,
Directors advised the authorities to allow greater exchange rate flexibility and to accelerate the
transition to an inflation targeting framework.
Directors welcomed the reported positive developments in the banking sector. Banks’ exposure
to foreign exchange risk has declined and bank capitalization and provisioning have risen,
providing a cushion against risks stemming from high non-performing loans. Directors warned,
however, that maintaining financial stability leaves no room for complacency and recommended
the authorities enforce consolidated supervision and high reporting standards, proceed with
independent audits of vulnerable banks, and develop contingency plans to support banks in case
of need.
Directors stressed the importance of fiscal consolidation for the overall adjustment effort. High
budget expenditure should be reduced by rationalizing public procurement, restraining the
growth in public sector wages and employment, and limiting pension indexation to inflation. In
addition, authorities should refrain from unaffordable tax cuts. Directors agreed that these
measures would reduce the fiscal deficit to a sustainable level over the medium term while
creating space for essential public investment.
Directors underscored the need for a comprehensive energy sector reform. They stressed that
upfront, meaningful, and broad-based tariff increases are essential for reducing large quasi-fiscal
losses, attracting new investments, and improving governance. Energy tariff increases should be
accompanied by measures to protect the most vulnerable households. Directors welcomed the
authorities’ plans to continue with energy-saving reforms, increase domestic gas production, and
2

At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the Board, summarizes the views of
Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the country's authorities. An explanation of any qualifiers
used in summings up can be found here: http://www.imf.org/external/np/sec/misc/qualifiers.htm.

diversify energy imports, but stressed that these measures cannot substitute for the indispensable
tariff adjustments.
Directors noted the uneven progress in improving the business climate. They welcomed the
streamlined procedures for starting a business, registering property, and dealing with
construction permits. Directors stressed that much more needs to be done to enhance institutional
capacity, strengthen the judicial system, improve law enforcement and tax administration, and
eradicate corruption.
In discussing the ex post evaluation report on the 2010 SBA, Directors noted some important
achievements, including the 2011 pension reform, but regretted the authorities’ insufficient
ownership, which undermined the program. Directors agreed that, in view of Ukraine’s track
record, arrangements with lower access and strong prior actions would be most appropriate.
While most Directors concurred that arrangements of shorter duration would also be preferable,
some others underscored that the structural nature of many of Ukraine’s economic problems calls
for maintaining a sufficiently long time horizon.

Statement by Oleksandr Petryk, Alternate Executive Director for Ukraine
December 16, 2013
My Ukrainian authorities greatly appreciate the professional and operational
cooperation between Ukraine and the Fund, and the technical and financial assistance
from the IMF to our country. The Fund’s assessments and recommendations are reviewed
and analyzed carefully and meticulously by my authorities. Many previous recommendations
have been implemented, some of them very quickly; others required a longer time to
complete, given the need to introduce appropriate legislation, to establish political consensus
in society and to coordinate with other reforms.
The authorities are paying close attention to the Fund’s views on the risks stemming
from the global and regional financial difficulties. They fully acknowledge that the state of
the global economy is uncertain and vulnerable. Recession continues in Europe and puts a
drag on Ukraine’s economy. On the one hand, there is some slowdown in economic growth
in Russia and China. As these countries and regions are the main trading partners of Ukraine,
demand for our major export products is under pressure. On the other hand, the prices for
imports, particularly with regard to energy, are high. Together, this is creating unfavorable
terms of trade and pressure on the current account, which is likely to continue if external
circumstances do not alter and domestic policies are not changed. As a result of the volatile
external environment, Ukraine's external position has deteriorated and economic growth has
stalled. The country entered a recession in the fall of 2012; the current account deficit
widened to over 8 percent of GDP; and gross international reserves dropped to 2.1 months of
future imports coverage. Despite a decline both in GDP (-1.3 percent in Q3) and in industrial
output (-5.2 percent in January-October), the Ukrainian economy showed signs of gradual
recovery, largely driven by agriculture output growth and private consumption. Agriculture
output growth amounted to 9.9 percent and retail trade amounted to 9.5 percent in JanuaryOctober. Intensified trade tensions with regional partners since July 2013 restrained the pace
of recovery, while hitting Ukraine`s exports and export dependent industries. Sluggish
aggregate demand, a plentiful harvest, and a virtually stable exchange rate and utility tariffs
were the principal factors for near zero inflation (0.2 percent y-o-y in November).
In spite of the difficult macroeconomic situation, high external imbalances, and
problems in the fiscal and energy sectors in Ukraine, my authorities made significant
efforts to implement important reforms in order to preserve price and financial
stability and restore sustainable economic growth.
Monetary policy and financial system
The authorities have made significant progress in their preparation for the inflation
targeting framework. The interest rate policy framework has been improved by enhancing
the effectiveness of the overnight interest rate corridor. In mid-June 2013 the National Bank
of Ukraine (NBU) started the placement of overnight deposit certificates. Accordingly, the

2
lower bound of the corridor is the interest rate on overnight deposit certificates, and the top
bound is the rate on overnight loans with collateral by government securities.
A model-based system of macroeconomic analysis and forecasting has been developed
and established by the NBU over the past years in order to support the monetary
policy decision-making process.
A financial stability unit was established in the NBU one year ago. The unit started to
work successfully in accordance with international experts’ assessments. A modeling toolkit
has been developed also for banking system stress testing purposes.
The NBU was able to achieve and maintain price stability and improve the performance
of the banking system, gradually restoring confidence in it.
The authorities’ policies contributed to the trend of dedollarization. The share of FX
deposits decreased to 38.6 percent in October starting from 43.6 percent in the beginning of
the year; right after the start of the financial crisis, it almost approached 50 percent. The share
of FX loans fell to 35.4 percent from 37 percent in the beginning of the year; before the crisis
it exceeded 50 percent.
Fiscal policy
The authorities have taken decisive steps on budget reforms. A new transfer pricing law
was introduced on September 1 in line with the relevant provisions of the Tax Code. The
implementation of transfer pricing will help prevent the artificial redistribution of assets in
the system of transnational corporations and create the conditions for a fair competition
environment. It also will reduce the tax burden on legitimate businesses as a result of the
clear definition of their market value, while preventing cases of tax evasion. Additional
budget revenues from this law will be near 0.5 billion Hryvnia in 2013.
Regulatory policy
According to the World Bank report on the ease of doing business (Doing Business 2014
"Understanding Regulations for Small and Medium-Size Enterprises") Ukraine has
become a leader among the countries-reformers of the reporting period, jumping 28
positions in one year. Ukraine has made the biggest breakthrough in the areas of "building
permits" (145 + positions), "registering property" (61 + position) and "loans" (11 +
positions). The electronic taxation reporting system was improved; the declaration for VAT
and Single Contribution was simplified; a licensing system, based on degrees of risk in
construction, was introduced; and the registration of ownership of real estate was simplified
last year.

Energy sector
In accordance with the EU directives program, economic reforms in Ukraine
particularly envisage reform of the biggest state gas company "Naftogaz of Ukraine".
This will lead to a removal of the cross-subsidization of production activity and will allow
achieving transparency in the company`s financial sector including the establishment of clear
rules for transfer pricing. A gas savings incentive system was introduced for heating
communal companies. It limits the consumption of gas for heating at a reduced price. The
consumption over these limits will be based on the import price. The economic effect is
estimated to be 4.1 billion of Hryvnia in 2013. Domestic gas production has increased by
0.5 billion of cubic meters in 2013. My authorities, by attracting investments, developed a
program for the modernization and renovation of the heating industry to improve the
efficiency of heat-generating equipment and reduce heat losses.
Some results of the policy directed at the improvement of energy efficiency have
already been achieved. The consumption of gas in Ukraine decreased by 7.2 per cent (y-oy) in January-October 2013.
Despite the above mentioned achievements and actions, and taking into account
accumulated misbalances and weaknesses, the authorities agree in general with the
changes in macroeconomic policy proposed by IMF staff. However they have their own
view on the size and speed of policy actions. Let’s consider them in detail:
In the area of monetary policy and financial system
My authorities consider that a one-time adjustment of the exchange rate, as proposed
by staff, may incur high risks for financial stability. Therefore, they propose a gradual
transition to a monetary regime based on interest rate management and a more flexible
exchange rate. The measures proposed to the staff were: (1) unification of market and official
exchange rate; (2) widening of the exchange rate band to +/-10 per cent from the current
level; and (3) further steps to increase the fluctuations of the exchange rate to deal with
external mismatches, if needed. So, my authorities are ready to adjust the exchange rate to
the level the Fund proposes, but they prefer to allow the market to achieve this level on its
own. In this way it will not undermine the credibility of the central bank and its monetary
policy, the cornerstone for further success of the new monetary framework.
Another benefit of a gradual adjustment of the exchange rate consists in the smoothing
of negative effects for the banking system. The IMF staff estimates the reduction of bank
capital at 2.25-4 percent of GDP as the result of the proposed devaluation and the
concomitant rise in NPLs. The authorities are concerned that staff may underestimate the
second-round effects of a large devaluation, and prefer to be on the safe side for financial
stability reasons.

4
The Ukrainian authorities aim to keep inflation (at least its core component) in the
target range of 4-6 per cent. IMF experts for many years emphasized the need for the
introduction of inflation targeting in Ukraine. The NBU has done much on a technical level
to achieve this, but a surge in inflation that inevitably accompanies a deep devaluation could,
for a long time, undermine the NBU’s credibility, which is indispensable for inflation
targeting.
The NBU will continue its preparations to adopt a full-blown inflation targeting
framework. This will involve strengthening its forecasting capacity, and upgrading the
operational framework of monetary policy. Further IMF technical assistance on the design of
the inflation targeting framework will be helpful.
In the area of fiscal policy
The authorities understand that fiscal policy should aim to support external
adjustments and strengthen the medium-term fiscal sustainability. Fiscal consolidation
will help contain domestic demand pressures and put public debt on a declining path. The
Ukrainian authorities are ready to adjust both the general government and Naftogaz deficits
as well as government guarantees since these are the main drivers of public debt. Fiscal
consolidation at the general government level will be achieved through a balanced
combination of revenue and expenditure measures. Besides, the choice of the projects for
government guarantees will be based on strict selection criteria in order to find the projects
with a maximum cost recovery effect, and with emphasis on energy saving technologies and
improvement of the balance of payments.
My authorities are concerned that a too rapid depletion of fiscal stimulus could have
strong negative effects on economic activity, with adverse consequences for fiscal
sustainability as well. They concur with staff that fiscal consolidation is needed, but favor a
more gradual pace in restricting the budget deficit and state guarantees in 2014.
In the energy sector
The authorities agree with the IMF staff on the need for a significant reduction of
inefficient subsidies in the energy sector. However, in some areas they need more time to
carry out the planned reforms in the most efficient way. They consider raising gas and
heating tariffs gradually in 2014-2015, starting with an increase in gas tariffs for households
who consume more than a specific predetermined level. This gradual approach will
strengthen the preparatory steps necessary to determine target groups for energy subsidies.
Otherwise, a wave of non-payments may arise after rapid hikes in heating tariffs for all
categories of the population, potentially undermining the positive effects for the balance
sheet of Naftogaz.

5
The Ukrainian authorities are ready to resume policy level discussions on a new Standby Arrangement with the Fund, which will help to stabilize the macroeconomic
situation and to restore sustainable economic growth.
Proposed activities, supported by the IMF, will restore access for Ukraine (both
Government and private sector) to international capital markets. Indeed, the increased
flexibility of the exchange rate, fiscal consolidation and reduced energy subsidies are
considered by a majority of experts (investors) to be prerequisites for the resumption of access
to external financial resources. Nonetheless, market participants agree as well that a deep
devaluation could be stressful for Ukraine’s financial system and may subsequently restrict
market funding sources.
My authorities thank the Fund for the continued constructive dialogue and agree with
most of the assessments and recommendations. They recognize the necessity to accelerate
reforms in the key policy sectors. However, consistency and balance in promoting reforms
are key for preserving financial stability and political consensus in the Ukrainian society, and
thus to realize the potential of the economy.
