STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2013 ARTICLE IV CONSULTATION
November 4, 2013

KEY ISSUES
Context. High oil prices and increased production have enabled the government to continue
to record high fiscal and external surpluses and build strong buffers. Large infrastructure
investments are expected to support the growth momentum.
Outlook and risks. Overall real non-oil gross domestic product (GDP) growth is projected to
increase modestly to 3 percent in 2013, driven by an increase in domestic consumption
and pick-up in public investment and to 4.4 percent in 2014. The overall average
consumer price inflation (CPI) is projected at 3 percent in 2013. The fiscal and external
surpluses are projected at 27 percent of GDP and 39 percent of GDP, respectively, in 2013,
reflecting high oil prices. The main downside risks to the outlook are a sustained fall in oil
prices and renewed political gridlock.
Macroeconomic policy mix. The government should increase capital spending, while over
the medium- to longer-term, oil wealth should be conserved for future generations through
lower current spending growth, particularly in wages and public employment, and higher nonoil revenues. Monetary conditions are expected to remain supportive of credit growth.
Financial stability. The banking system is resilient to credit and market risks. Investment
companies (ICs) are still deleveraging and restructuring. Providing greater institutional and
functional autonomy for the central bank, and developing a more formal macroprudential
institutional and policy framework would help strengthen macroeconomic and financial
stability. A review of the investment companies (ICs) segment, with particular focus on their
objectives and role in the economy, and financial viability is needed.
Diversifying the economy and creating jobs for nationals in the private sector. Reducing
Kuwait’s dependence on oil in the future will require economic diversification, particularly in
export-oriented industries, which calls for further structural reforms to improve the business
environment and governance. Creating incentives for employment of nationals in the private
non-oil sectors would entail containing growth in public sector wages and jobs. An integrated
plan for job creation in the private sector is called for, some elements of which will include
enhancing the educational quality and vocational training, promoting female labor force
training, and encouraging entrepreneurship by developing the small and medium-sized
enterprises (SMEs) sector.

BACKGROUND
1.
Kuwait is an oil-rich and high-income country, but it lags behind internationally on
many economic and social indicators. Kuwait has the sixth largest proven oil reserves in the
world at 102 billion barrels, which at the current rate of production would last for 90 years.
Kuwaitis comprise 32 percent of the total population of 3.8 million. The labor market is highly
segmented. About 70 percent of government employees are Kuwaitis, while 95 percent of
private-sector employees are non-Kuwaitis (Figure 2). Kuwait fares relatively low in international
comparison in social and governance indicators (Figures 3 and 4), and relatively high in financial
inclusion indicators (Figure 5). Kuwait’s per capita income was about $48,000 in 2012 with an
unemployment rate of 3 percent for Kuwaitis.
2.
Recent domestic political developments have had an adverse impact on fiscal and
economic developments in Kuwait.1 The implementation of the 2010–14 Development Plan
(DP) has lagged behind, and large increases in the public-sector wage bill have undermined the
2
government’s efforts to encourage Kuwaitis to join the private sector. The financial situation of
banks is strong, and the banking system is well-regulated by the Central Bank of Kuwait (CBK).
Investment companies are still deleveraging, and further restructuring, consolidation, and exit are
needed in this sector.
3.
It is vital to agree on an agenda to place the DP on track, improve the business
environment and investment climate, and boost non-oil growth. The long-term objective
should aim toward diversification and job creation for Kuwaitis in the private sector. Building
human capital, improving the efficiency of public administration, and removing impediments to
physical, legal, and business infrastructure would support these goals. High per capita income
and large external wealth should provide support for the transformation needed.

RECENT DEVELOPMENTS
4.
Kuwait’s economic performance has lagged behind its GCC peers and its own past
performance. Since the global financial crisis of 2008, non-oil growth has been negative or low
(Figure 1). Public investment as percent of GDP has been below the GCC average because of
delays in the implementation of economic reforms and infrastructure projects. Social and global

1

The political environment has remained highly contentious since 2006, as tensions between parliament and the
government led to six parliamentary elections since June 2006, with the most recent held on July 27, 2013.

2

The Kuwait Development Plan is a series of five-year plans approved by parliament in February 2010, stretching
to 2035 and aimed at converting Kuwait into a trade and financial hub of the region. A Plan of about $130 billion
was to be implemented with private-sector participation, including a variety of Public-Private Partnership (PPP)
mechanisms, with the objectives of increasing the private sector’s contribution to the economy, creating jobs, and
providing long-term investment opportunities. Investment is envisaged in projects across a variety of sectors,
including oil, utilities, infrastructure, and services (especially healthcare and education).

5.
The non-oil economy is projected to continue its recovery in 2013. Non-oil growth is
expected to increase modestly to 3 percent, driven by a combination of a continued increase in
domestic consumption as a result of the 2012 public wage hike and some pick-up in government
capital spending. A slight reduction in oil production would bring down total real GDP growth
below 1 percent. The average inflation in September 2013 was about 3 percent year-on-year (y-oy) and is projected to remain stable at 3 percent. Current account surplus is expected to remain
large in 2013 at 39 percent of GDP.
6.
Despite rising current expenditures, the fiscal surplus is projected to remain high at
27 percent of GDP in 2013, reflecting high oil prices. Spending is projected to rise by
13 percent, mainly because of increased public employment, subsidies and social benefits, and
capital spending (Figures 6 and 7). Capital expenditure, which underperformed the budget
allocation in 2012, as continued political uncertainty stalled the implementation of investment
projects, is expected to increase by 47 percent in 2013/14 compared to 2012/13.
7.
Monetary policy has remained accommodative and bank credit growth has picked
up. The Central Bank of Kuwait (CBK) reduced the benchmark discount rate to 2 percent in
October 2012, which brought down the weighted average deposit and lending rates to
1.53 percent and 4.63 percent, respectively at end-June 2013 (from 1.60 percent and 4.86 percent,
respectively in October 2012). Bank credit grew y-o-y by 6.2 percent in June 2013, reflecting
strong growth in personal loans (Figure 8). Excess liquidity of the banking system—bank reserves
at the central bank—has been steadily rising as total deposits increased by 9 percent y-o-y in
June 2013. Bank lending to non-bank financial institutions contracted by about 19 percent y-o-y
in June 2013, representing 6.3 percent of banks’ total credit portfolio.
8.
Bank profitability has remained stable (Figure 8) and soundness indicators appear
strong. Some ICs continued to record losses in 2012, though of a lower order. Overall, since their
peak in 2008, investment companies’ (ICs) proprietary assets shrank by 32 percent, and assets
under management shrank by 15 percent. The nonfinancial corporate sector continued to record
profits in 2012 although a number of companies in the real estate sector posted losses.

OUTLOOK AND RISKS
9.
The economic outlook is expected to improve further in 2014 and over the medium
term. In 2014, non-oil growth is expected to increase to 4.4 percent supported by public capital
spending, driving average inflation to 3.5 percent. A constant level of oil production would keep
total real GDP growth below 3 percent. Fiscal and current account surpluses are expected to
remain large in 2014. Over the medium term, non-oil growth is projected to accelerate to about
5 percent. A moderate increase in oil production is expected to further support overall growth.
Inflation is projected to increase slightly as growth picks up. The fiscal and current account
surpluses are projected to taper if spending continues on the current growth trajectory. The
authorities agreed with staff’s projections.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

KUWAIT

10.
Achieving the projected baseline growth in the medium term requires that there is a
political consensus to place public investment and structural reforms on track. The
authorities agreed with staff’s assessment that protracted political uncertainty would adversely
affect overall business confidence and the investment climate and result in lower non-oil growth
than projected. They, however, felt that inclusiveness of the new parliament raises the prospect of
improving its working relationship with the new government, although recent inquiries of some
members of parliament into the legality of some major public investment projects highlight the
risk of potential political gridlock.
11.
Downside external risks to the outlook could arise from a worsening of global
economic conditions, including a lower than anticipated growth potential in key emerging
market countries, that would translate into lower oil demand and prices (Risk Assessment
Fiscal Balances Sensitive to Oil Prices, 2009–18

expenditures—most of which are hard to reverse—and relatively small non-oil revenues,
government expenditure in the baseline would exceed oil revenues by 2017/18, thus increasing
the fiscal risk from a sustained drop in oil prices, a concern that the authorities shared.

A one standard deviation decline in oil prices ($25) relative to the baseline between 2014–18, a one-in-nine
probability based on option markets, will result in a decline of the current account and fiscal surplus to 16 percent
and 3 percent of GDP, respectively, in 2018.

The Risk Assessment Matrix (RAM) shows events that could materially alter the baseline path discussed in this report (which is
the scenario most likely to materialize in the view of IMF staff). The relative likelihood of risks listed is the staff’s subjective
assessment of the risks surrounding this baseline. The RAM reflects staff's views on the source of risks and overall level of
concerns that will be discussed with the authorities.

12.
Tighter financial conditions due to quantitative easing (QE) tapering and/or
reemergence of financial stress in the euro area may increase vulnerabilities and result in
market and credit risks for banks and non-bank financial institutions, forcing further
deleveraging by ICs, and increasing banks’ risk aversion. Banks have direct exposures to the real
estate sector (18.5 percent of total loans in June 2013 on a consolidated basis), in addition to

equity and real estate collaterals. While the central bank is monitoring the banking system to
ensure that they don’t take on excessive risks in these circumstances, the banking system is
adequately capitalized and has ample liquidity to withstand shocks under severe macro scenarios.
The recovery of investment companies which are exposed to market risk, particularly those under
restructuring, would be further delayed, however.
13.
In the medium to long term, global oil market developments will affect Kuwait’s
economic outlook. Over the next five years, Kuwait’s oil output is projected to grow modestly,
and the non-oil sector will be the main driver of growth, albeit supported by government
investment. However, the projected increases in the production of unconventional oil in the
United States and other parts of the world, and the recovery in production in Iraq and Libya, could
result in a lower path for oil production in Kuwait than is assumed in the baseline or a larger drop
5
in oil prices. The authorities felt that the emerging scenario in the global market was not clear
and that the call on OPEC to fill the demand gap in crude oil would depend on the ability of nonOPEC suppliers to sustain shale oil production, as well as the cost of production. They agreed that
both scenarios would see a more significant decline in oil export revenues, and if sustained would
eventually result in a bigger adjustment in fiscal spending. Thus, in the current situation where oil
prices are high, the authorities recognize that it will be important to save the additional oil
revenues to further build fiscal buffers and develop the non-oil economy.

POLICY CHALLENGES
Staff and the authorities agreed that the main priorities were: (i) strengthening non-oil growth while
continuing to save for intergenerational equity; (ii) aiming toward diversification and creating jobs for
Kuwaitis in the private sector; and (iii) continuing to strengthen macroeconomic and financial stability to
ensure a conducive climate for private investment.

spending to advance social and physical infrastructure projects and boost non-oil growth.
Benefiting from high oil prices in recent years, the government has been running large budget
surpluses over the last decade. To determine the mix of investment and current expenditure, staff
used a model-based analysis indicating that the government has the space to undertake this
increased capital spending, while underlining the need to contain current spending further

5

In 2014, and over the medium term, the International Energy Agency’s projections show that demand for OPEC
crude is expected to fall in absolute terms, putting pressure on oil exporters to scale back output. Under a scenario
of constant crude oil production of 2.8 million barrels a day (mbd) between 2014–18, the fiscal balance will still
record a surplus of about 11 percent of GDP in 2018.

6

A previous staff study (IMF Country Report 11/217) has estimated an expenditure multiplier of 0.9–1.3 for Kuwait,
with a higher effect of capital expenditure.

(discussed below). The investment profile projected by staff in the baseline is consistent with the
authorities’ plans and drives the medium-term non-oil growth projections. The overall fiscal
stance (based on the non-oil balance as percent of non-oil GDP, excluding pension
recapitalization) is expansionary until the beginning of FY 2014/15 and thereafter indicates
consolidation, mitigating concerns of overheating.
15.
Staff emphasized the importance of ensuring the quality and efficiency of spending.
Staff also stressed the importance of establishing a framework for coordination among the
agencies responsible for the delivery of infrastructure projects to ensure timely implementation.

Over the medium to longer term, oil wealth should be conserved for future

and the limited role of the private sector were the most prominent challenges facing the Kuwaiti
economy, and a medium-term fiscal policy agenda together with a communication strategy will
guide the reform process.
17.
The authorities agreed with the policy measures proposed by staff to gradually
reduce the non-oil fiscal deficit over the medium term and beyond.


Containing the increase in government jobs and wages should remain the key focus.
Curtailing the increase in government jobs and keeping the growth in government wages
below inflation would result in saving of at least 0.7 percent of GDP per year, as well as reset
expectations and realign incentives for Kuwaitis to work in the private sector.



Developing non-oil revenue sources is important. Little progress has been made in building
the non-hydrocarbon tax system. The only major reform took place in 2008, when the
corporate income tax (CIT) rate was changed from a progressive to a flat rate of 15 percent for
foreign companies. The existing CIT that is now imposed only on foreign companies could be
applied to Kuwaiti companies. The Ministry of Finance is considering and internally discussing
the recommendations of Fund TA in this regard. Staff also encouraged the authorities to work
in concert with the other GCC countries in the implementation of the value added tax (VAT).
The authorities are improving tax administration with the support of Fund and Bank TA for
preparing the ground for introduction of VAT in the future.



Subsidies, particularly for electricity and fuel (over 6 percent of GDP) engender wasteful
consumption and need to be targeted. A gradual alignment with international prices while
ensuring that a social safety net is in place, would in the long run increase overall efficiency
and generate more fiscal space. The Ministry of Finance is planning to evaluate the existing
subsidies. Conservation-oriented tariff structures could boost efficiency in power and fuel
consumption. A communications campaign that raises awareness about the cost of subsidies
and the benefits of reform is essential to generate broad public support.

18.
The authorities agreed that it is time to restrain current spending and they intend to
develop a realistic and pragmatic medium-term policy document to drive reforms. They agreed
that rising current expenditures, particularly on account of wages and fuel and electricity subsidies
had led to a significant increase in the size of the budget over the past few years. The increase in
the government wage bill has been compounded by the need to absorb Kuwaitis entering the
workforce, since the private sector is not absorbing them. On the revenue side, they explained
that any increase in the fee structure, for example with regard to electricity charges, would need
an amendment to existing legislation.8 They, however, stressed that Kuwait’s financial strength
afforded the adoption of a gradualist approach to reforms that takes into consideration, among
others, absorption capacity and an appropriate communication strategy to generate broad public

improve service collection, and to increase greater transparency in the billing process.

support. They emphasized that fiscal reforms would need to be complemented by changes in the
entitlement culture of the people, enhanced education, and promotion of entrepreneurship.
19.
The authorities recognize the benefits of developing a formal medium-term budget
framework, strengthening the capacity of the macro-fiscal unit, and publishing fiscal data
in GFSM 2001 format over the medium term. These reforms would better integrate the fiveyear DP into the annual budget planning process, look at the impact of current year commitments
in a multi-year context, and identify fiscal risks on the revenue and expenditure sides. To support
this framework and strengthen controls on line ministries, the introduction of Government
Financial Management Information System (GFMIS) is important. The macro-fiscal unit in the
Ministry of Finance, established with Fund TA, needs to be strengthened in analysis and capacity,
to help link budget policies to macroeconomic objectives and to deepen the understanding of
9
how fiscal decisions affect the real economy. The Fund resident advisor can help achieve these
objectives. Lastly, fiscal planning and transparency would be helped by the production and
publication of data in line with GFSM2001 standards.
20.
The current accommodative monetary policy stance is appropriate. Current liquidity
conditions are supportive of emerging demand for credit. Banks should continue to be vigilant
toward credit risks and continue to strengthen risk management. In the context of the currency
basket exchange rate peg, in the event of a tightening of global financial conditions, the
authorities should continue to be proactive in liquidity management and the use of
macroprudential policies to contain emerging financial risks. The central bank has a range of
instruments in its macroprudential toolkit, including limits on debt service–to–income ratios, timevarying loan-to-deposit ratios, sectoral concentration limits, and differential risk weights for loans,
which it is ready to use flexibly as the situation warrants. The authorities saw merit in staff’s advice
to further deepen the domestic money market in a phased manner, but felt that CBK bills
issuances of 3- and 6-month maturity are presently serving the purpose of absorbing liquidity
from the market.
21.
Staff supports maintaining the exchange rate peg to a basket, as it has provided a
strong and credible monetary anchor. Assessment of the exchange rate using the
macrobalance approach (MB) suggests that the currency is broadly in line with fundamentals
(Appendix I). The equilibrium real effective exchange rate (EREER) approach suggests that the real
exchange rate is currently in line with its estimated long-run equilibrium. The MB estimate is very
close to the projected current account and implies no misalignment either. The external
sustainability (ES) approach shows a wide range of current account benchmarks, implying both
undervaluation (based on real annuity) and overvaluation (based on real per capita annuity) and
making it difficult to draw any definitive conclusions using this methodology (Appendix I). The
9

The macro-fiscal unit, which was established in 2011, is staffed and operational. The unit issues regular reports on
fiscal performance, inflation developments, and the oil sector. In addition, the Unit was responsible for preparing a
Citizen’s Budget, the first of its kind in the GCC. The focus of the Unit is on refining forecasting and
macroeconomic analysis, as well as providing support to the planned introduction of medium-term budget
framework in Kuwait.

authorities indicated that the basket peg has served them well, among others, in managing the
impact of imported inflation, ensuring the stability of the Kuwaiti Dinar against major currencies,
and simplifying government budget formulation process. In the meantime, reforms that would
support a more flexible arrangement if it becomes appropriate at a later date, such as further
deepening the money market and developing the local bond market, should continue.

B. Diversification and Job Creation for Nationals in the Private Sector
22.
The authorities recognize the challenges to diversifying the economy. Despite a less
concentrated output structure—hydrocarbon accounts for about 63 percent of output—export

and risks to long-run growth.
23.
Economic diversification into areas with potential for greater national employment
requires an integrated strategy and continuing efforts. The rapidly increasing national youth
labor force calls for a sustained increase in non-oil growth, investment in education, and labor
market reforms (Box 1). At the same time, reducing Kuwait’s dependence on oil requires reforms
to spur diversification. In addition to identifying strategic areas for diversification, structural
reforms will be required for improving the business environment, and promoting a greater role for
small and medium enterprises (SMEs). The authorities are creating special economic zones, which
will partly alleviate the scarcity of land availability to the private sector and attract investment. A
strategy for making land available for investment would be desirable. Promotion of exportoriented industries would further support diversification efforts. An avenue to improving export
diversification would be to enhance current non-oil exports and support the entry into new
product markets to generate productivity gains. Manufacturing has strong potential to create a
mix of various tradable goods, and there is also scope to expand the role of tradable services.
Mainly to provide financing to the SME sector, the authorities recently set up a national fund for
SMEs with a corpus of KD2 billion (approximately $7 billion). Efforts are also being directed
toward mitigating the nonfinancing barriers such as land availability and support services.

24.
The passage of a number of new laws is a step in the right direction to encourage
private sector development. The passage of the new Company law, the establishment of an
institutional framework for public-private partnerships (PPPs) and the recently introduced Direct
Investment Promotion Law are aimed at enhancing the confidence of investors and increasing
investments in Kuwait. Several new pieces of legislation that are still in development, including
laws for bankruptcy, transparency, public tenders, and competition need to be promulgated. At
the same time, measures such as the writing-off of interest payments and rescheduling a part of
the household debt create moral hazard for banks and borrowers, are counterproductive to
building an efficient financial culture and a credible business environment, and in staff’s views,
should be avoided in the future (Box 2).
25.
Staff welcomes the authorities’ efforts to increase the transparency, governance and
effectiveness of public administration. The adoption of the anti-corruption and anti-money
laundering and countering the financing of terrorism (AML/CFT) laws and the establishment of
the anti-corruption authority are part of the authorities’ efforts to address these issues. The
authorities are streamlining some bureaucratic processes, and have made progress to reduce the
lag for issuing licenses for new businesses through the establishment of a single-window system.
The momentum in these reforms needs to be sustained to enhance investor confidence.

Box 1. Kuwait Labor Market Reforms
Between 2012–16, staff projects 74,000–112,000 Kuwaitis would enter the labor market. The private
sector is projected to create 17,000 jobs for Kuwaitis, and without significant structural reforms, the
government will feel the pressure to absorb the remaining entrants at a faster pace than in the past, further
increasing government employment by 13–22 percent (with a fiscal cost of less than one percent of GDP per
year).1 Currently, 90 percent of Kuwaiti workers are employed in the public sector and 90 percent of nonKuwaiti workers are in the private sector.2

The current labor market structure is not providing incentives for Kuwaitis to work in the private
sector. Currently, there is a large wage differential between public and private sector jobs, which creates a
disincentive to work in the private sector. While existing subsidies for Kuwaitis working in the private sector (in
the form of permanent allowances offered to all nationals in the private sector) partly alleviate the wage
differential, frequent increases in government wages (like the 25 percent increase in 2012) erode the subsidy.3
Job security and higher benefits (including less hours of work) will continue to attract Kuwaitis to the public
sector. In addition, the generous Kuwaiti pension system (paying around $125,000 per year to a retiree)
stipulates a low retirement age (40 for women and 49 for men) decreasing the incentive to pursue higher
education and a career in the private sector where relatively higher wages are achieved only after years of
experience.
Kuwaitis need appropriate incentives in order to pursue private sector employment. To help attract
Kuwaitis to the private sector, it is important to contain wages of public employees and to further develop the
work culture among Kuwaitis. Moreover, subsidies could be better targeted by excluding high earners in the
private sector where the subsidy is not needed.

The government is initiating labor market reforms aimed at reducing the share of foreign workers in
the labor force and absorbing Kuwaiti entrants. Recent policies include expelling illegal foreign workers,
centralizing the administration of work permits in the private sector for foreign workers to better regulate the
inflow of labor, and updating the quotas system to ensure that jobs exist for Kuwaitis in the private sector. In
addition, the government is pursuing diversification policies to enhance the private sector and SMEs.

Proper training of Kuwaitis is essential to increase employment opportunities for Kuwaitis in the
private sector. Kuwait shows relatively low public spending in education and weaker educational achievement
suggesting that there is scope for the government to contribute to enhancing Kuwaiti’s human capital.
Moreover, like in other GCC countries, larger government training programs could be put in place in Kuwait, to
help Kuwaitis succeed in private sector jobs. Following Bahrain’s successful 2004 labor market reform, Kuwait
could consider the adoption of an unemployment insurance scheme that requires participation in training.

Box 2. Bank Household Debt Restructuring
In April 2013 the government passed the Family Support Fund Law, under which the government will
buy an estimated $2.6 billion of outstanding non-Islamic banks’ and investment companies’
consumer and installment loans and reschedule repayment after waiving interest.1 The government
will set up the Family Support Fund to buy from banks outstanding loans taken before March 30, 2008. This
would constitute 10 percent of total outstanding consumer and installment loans of banks at end-June
2013. The scheme is estimated to benefit around 50,000 Kuwaitis (4 percent of nationals). These loans will
be rescheduled over a period not exceeding 15 years. The motivation for this law relates to the fulfillment of
a debt-relief election promise from December 2012.
The direct initial financial cost of the plan is small, in terms of its limited impact on public debt
sustainability and the available fiscal space. The restructured debt constitutes about 1.6 percent of GDP,
amounting to 2.2 percent of total revenues and 2.6 percent of hydrocarbon revenues in 2012. The cost to
the government is frontloaded and is expected to be amortized over the rescheduled period of the loan.
The projected cost for banks is not expected to be high. Banks will benefit from the restructuring to the
extent the restructuring would remove nonperforming loans from their balance sheets.2 Banks will bear
minor administrative costs for transferring the loans to the government and also the return differential
between the loans repaid by the government and banks’ related new assets. The cost to the financial system
is estimated by staff at $185 million (small compared to $4 billion in pre-tax net income in 2012 for the top
7 banks).3
Good principles for household debt restructuring include restoring viability of borrowers while
mitigating moral hazard, minimizing the direct fiscal cost by targeting borrowers, reducing bank
failure risks, and transparency and accountability in the use of public funds.4 While Kuwait’s
restructuring restores viability of borrowers, it only partly mitigates moral hazard as the targeting still
includes borrowers who were fully performing. There is no evidence that NPLs on the restructured loans
were high or that financial stability was at risk although targeted loans were issued during the pre-crisis
period when consumer and installment loans were growing strongly at around 15 percent per year.

Box 2. Bank Household Debt Restructuring (concluded)
The restructuring is counterproductive to building an efficient financial culture. The write-off of
interest payments and debt restructuring for Kuwaiti nationals would create moral hazard for banks and
borrowers, thereby undermining the development of a sound credit culture. While CBK regulation caps total
loan installments at 40 percent of salary, the restructuring creates incentives for excessive borrowing by
households and excessive risk taking by banks at a time when consumer and installment loans are already
growing strongly (see figure). It will be important in Kuwait to strengthen the legal, institutional and
regulatory framework for an effective personal bankruptcy framework and enforcement of creditor rights.

CBK defines “Consumer Loan” as a loan granted by local banks to the customer with the purpose of financing purchase

medication. An “Installment Loan” is a loan utilized by the customer for non-commercial purposes, particularly for
restoration or purchase of private residence.

June 2009.

26.
Well-functioning local debt markets can make a vital contribution to the efficiency
of financial intermediation. A deep and liquid domestic debt market will provide longer-term
or more competitive sources of funding for public debt as well as corporate, housing, and
infrastructure investment than may be available from the banking system. The government and
the central bank have an important role to play in the process of developing the legal,
institutional and regulatory infrastructure. The central bank has taken initiatives to develop the
yield curve by issuing 3- and 6-month maturity CBK bonds and 1- to 10-year maturity Treasury
bonds. These bonds are issued based on liquidity needs of the banking system, with a
preannounced coupon rate. Staff encouraged the authorities to consider publishing an issuance
calendar, increasing the size of issuances, and activating a price-based auction system in the
future to create a more liquid benchmark yield curve. The authorities did not see the immediate
need for an issuance calendar in view of the lack of sustained demand by banks for long-term
bonds, but indicated that they would be willing to consider these options when circumstances
warrant a change.
27.
Staff and authorities agreed that an active labor market policy is required to
encourage nationals to enter private sector jobs. The success of recent policies aimed at
increasing the share of Kuwaitis in the labor force hinges on providing Kuwaitis with incentives to
work in the private sector. While the existing subsidy system enhances the salaries of Kuwaitis
working in the private sector and encourages job search by Kuwaitis in the private sector, the
recent increase in government salaries has once again widened the wage gap between the public

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

19

KUWAIT

and the private sectors and eroded the subsidy.10 The large wage differential poses strong
incentives for nationals, particularly those who are less educated to prefer public-sector
employment.
28.
The authorities recognized that closing the gap between public and private sector
wages by containing the growth of public-sector jobs and wages was necessary, but noted
the pressure to create government jobs for nationals if private sector job opportunities did
not materialize. To increase the role of the private sector in the economy, the authorities
underscored the importance of developing a good work culture, improving education, and
fostering entrepreneurship and SMEs. An integrated plan that coordinates the efforts from
involved institutions for job creation in the private sector is called for, some elements of which
will include coordinating with the private sector in setting up skill improvement programs,
enhancing the educational quality and vocational training, promoting female labor force training
and participation, and encouraging entrepreneurship. The government’s focus on developing
SMEs and existing programs to raise awareness of private sector jobs has the potential to
enhance private sector employment.

C. Strengthening Macroeconomic and Financial Stability
29.
High capitalization, continued profitability, declining NPLs, and high provisioning
of the banking system support financial stability. Credit risk is the most significant risk for the
Kuwaiti consolidated banking system, a natural outcome of the business model of banks,
accounting for 90 percent of their risk-weighted assets. The risk is concentrated in the real estate
sector, as banks direct exposures to this sector constitute 18.5 percent of total loans at end-June
2013. The banking system’s exposure to the equity market makes up for 23 percent of its total
investments (total investments make up for 12 percent of total assets), and the use of firms’
shares as collateral accounts for 32 percent of total collateral, the remaining predominantly in
real estate. The banking system’s exposure to ICs has been contained at 4.8 percent of total loans
at end-June 2013, and they are fully provisioned against the troubled ICs, mitigating credit and
investment risks from the ICs sector. Liquidity risk of the banking system is well contained as
one-third of banks’ assets are liquid. Moreover, wholesale foreign liabilities of banks were only
6 percent of the total balance sheet size at end-May 2013.
30.
The banking system is resilient to potential shocks. Banks are well regulated by the
CBK and had an average capital adequacy ratio of 18.3 percent (Tier 1 capital of 16.6 percent) at
end-June 2013. Gross NPLs declined to 4.6 percent at end-June 2013 from 5.2 percent at end2012 (Figure 10).11 Banks had a provisioning ratio of 107 percent at end-June 2013. Staff’s
analysis shows that even under severe stress testing scenarios with credit risk mitigants and loss
given default, the combined tier-1 capital of the banking system will remain above the regulatory

minimum of 8 percent on average (Selected Issues Paper III).12 Results of the central bank’s stress
testing exercise also show that banks are well placed to withstand credit, market, and liquidity
shocks under a wide range of micro- and macroeconomic scenarios. Recent regulations
introduced by the central bank, such a stable funding ratio requirement replacing the loan-todeposit ratio, corporate governance code, draft guidelines for the implementation of Basel III,
stricter provisioning norms, will further strengthening risk management by banks.
31.
ICs have large exposures to domestic, regional, and international equity and real
estate markets, which make them vulnerable to market swings.13 The ICs sector continued to
record losses in 2012, though progressively lower since 2008. They are also exposed to regional
and global asset markets, with foreign assets constituting 48 percent of total assets. Despite
considerable deleveraging, foreign liabilities of ICs account for 22 percent of total liabilities at
end-May 2013. In the absence of an adequate bankruptcy/restructuring framework, the
timeframe and the legal process under which weak and unviable ICs have been restructuring
have remained protracted. The liquidation/foreclosure proceedings have been lengthy and
Kuwait’s performance compares less favorably with the experience of GCC countries and
international experience. The CBK emphasized that the risks posed by the ICs sector to financial
stability are contained by the lower exposure of the banking system to the ICs sector. The CMA
has delisted ICs from the stock exchange when restructuring and recapitalization have not been
possible. The authorities agreed that the progress in restructuring a few companies was slow,
and are currently working towards implementing a resolution framework in consultation with the
World Bank.
32.
The authorities and staff agreed that notwithstanding the strength of the banking
system, there is room for improving asset quality, profitability, liquidity and capital
adequacy. The interconnectedness among banks, industrial and commercial groups, sovereign
and investment companies can pose a risk to the financial system and the economy during
periods of stress.


There is scope for refining the existing macroprudential toolkit. The CBK has many of
the tools that can help address vulnerabilities at an early stage, as well as help build buffers
to absorb shocks ex post. In the area of building and maintaining buffers, the CBK has been
relying strongly on high capitalization of banks and building provisions. This would be
usefully complemented by an enhanced role for Pillar 2, and a further strengthening of riskbased supervision. While CBK already has time-varying loan-to-deposit ratios to alleviate
procyclicality, time-varying loan-to-value ratios could help contain exposure to the real

12

To assess the sensitivity of banks’ capital ratios to credit risk mitigants, a 15 percent and 50 percent reduction
in the value of collateral was assumed. Stress tests were also conducted based on Loss-Given Default (LGD) at
about 50–60 percent and Probabilities of Default (PoDs) of 0.1-10 percent in the central scenario and 0.15 to
25 percent in the severe stress scenarios.

13

The total on-balance sheet exposure of conventional and Islamic ICs stood at $25 billion at end-May 2013. In
addition, total assets under management by ICs were $67 billion at end-May 2013.

estate sector and reduce credit concentration. CBK is developing its regulation to comply
with Basel III requirements by end-2013.


The independence of the central bank needs to be strengthened, a view that the
authorities welcomed. The CBK should be provided with an enhanced mandate for
institutional and functional autonomy, balanced by strengthened governance and
accountability. Staff welcomes the publication of the first Financial Stability Report. Staff and
the authorities agreed that to build on the current progress in improving regulation and
supervision, the development of a more formal macroprudential policy framework would be
desirable. It should entail the inclusion of a financial stability mandate to the CBK, and
defining a coordination framework between the relevant supervisory institutions.
Strengthening the CBK’s autonomy along with the legal underpinnings to establish and chair
an appropriate form and mechanism of coordination for financial stability, with both
preventive and crisis management responsibilities would enhance the ability of the
authorities to deal with systemic risk.



The expansion of Kuwaiti banks abroad is an opportunity to diversify their portfolio
and earnings but also poses risks. CBK is conducting onsite supervision of banks’ foreign
branches and subsidiaries and collaborating, engaging, and sharing information with other
host supervisors. In line with the Basel Committee views, further strengthening cooperation
with the most important host supervisors of Kuwaiti banks would be desirable. Going
forward, improvements in the resolution framework, consistent with the Financial Stability
Board guidelines would help facilitate the coordinated resolution of financial institutions that
are active in multiple countries.



The current restructuring of ICs needs to be expedited. Further strengthening the
regulatory oversight, greater information disclosure, and consolidation are needed to
strengthen the ICs sector. Staff recommended the initiation of a thorough review of the
investment companies segment, with particular focus on their objectives and role in the
economy, and financial viability. Some consolidation would be desirable for reducing ICs’
operating and regulatory compliance costs and increasing efficiency, which staff and the
authorities agreed should be market based. Currently, the CMA is focused on strengthening
the regulation of ICs and implementing corporate governance codes, but it does not have
14
plans to initiate a review to evolve an integrated strategy for this sector (Appendix II).



Greater information disclosure is needed to help assess and monitor risks in the ICs
sector.

33.
The new AML/CFT law is a welcome development. The Kuwaiti cabinet recently
discussed a draft decree, authorizing the creation of a new financial intelligence unit (FIU). Staff

14

It has issued new regulations on investment funds (including on asset managers, custodians, controllers,
permissible funds and activities, investment guidelines, valuations, alternative managers), brokerage activity,
information disclosure, and corporate governance.

looks forward to the development of procedures to freeze terrorist assets, and the establishment
of a fully operational and independent FIU.

D. Other Issues
34.
While there has been good progress in improving Kuwait’s statistical system, staff
encourages the authorities to continue their efforts in all areas of economic data. In
addition, Kuwait would benefit from the cooperation with GCCStat, the new statistical agency of
the Gulf countries, in standardizing and disseminating the data.

STAFF APPRAISAL
35.
The economic outlook is expected to improve in 2013 and remain robust in the
medium term. During 2014–18, a large public investment program will support an average real
growth of close to 5 percent in the non-oil sector. Achieving this growth rate requires political
commitment to place the public investment program and structural reforms on track. In addition,
it is important to establish a framework for coordination among the agencies responsible for the
delivery of infrastructure projects to ensure timely implementation.
36.
The fiscal position is strong, but a sustained drop in oil prices would deplete fiscal
surpluses. While there is fiscal space to increase capital spending, intergenerational equity
considerations warrant containment of current spending. Overall, a phased reduction in the nonhydrocarbon fiscal deficit by 8 percent of GDP (16 percent of non-oil GDP), relative to the
projected path, is essential over the medium term to continue saving for future generations.
Fiscal restraint through lower current spending growth, particularly wages and subsidies, and
higher non-oil revenues is required to reduce the non-oil deficit gradually over the medium term.
The implementation of the proposed measures to contain the non-oil deficit should, however,
commence in the near term, since delays would result in the widening of this deficit and require
larger adjustment in the future.
37.
Strengthening the macro-fiscal unit would support fiscal policy making and the
development of a medium-term budget framework to ensure the efficiency of public
spending. A solid medium-term expenditure framework would help manage the path of fiscal
spending consistent with Kuwait’s Development Plan.
38.
Expediting the restructuring, further implementing the regulatory oversight,
greater information disclosure, and consolidation are needed to strengthen the ICs sector.
An integrated strategy is required to ensure the sustained financial viability of these companies,
and to determine their role in the economy.
39.
The banking system is well regulated and resilient to risks. Nevertheless, there is
scope for continuous refining of the macroprudential toolkit to sustain the strength of the
banking system and mitigate systemic risks. Strengthening the central bank’s autonomy and
legal underpinnings for macroprudential supervision would enhance the ability of the authorities
to deal with systemic risk.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

40.
An active labor market policy is required to encourage nationals to enter private
sector jobs. Additional reforms would help in containing growth in public-sector employment
and wages, to reset and realign incentives toward private sector employment, setting up skill
improvement programs, enhancing the educational quality and vocational training, promoting
female labor force training and participation, and encouraging entrepreneurship.
41.
Economic diversification into areas with potential for greater national employment
should constitute a key priority. Structural reforms will be required for improving the business
environment, and promoting a greater role for SMEs. Manufacturing has strong potential to
create a mix of various tradable goods, and there is also scope to expand the role of tradable
services.
42.
More needs to be done for improving the investment climate, including through
streamlining bureaucratic practices. Infusing greater transparency, governance and
effectiveness of public administration will help increase confidence of investors. While the
adoption of the anti-corruption and anti-money laundering laws and the establishment of the
anti-corruption authority are welcome developments, establishment of an operationally
independent FIU will contribute to bolstering the authorities’ and improving the business climate.
43.
Well-functioning local debt markets can help the diversification process by
providing longer-term or more competitive sources of funding for corporate, housing, and
infrastructure investment than may be available from the banking system. The government and
the central bank have an important role in this process of strengthening the legal, institutional
and regulatory infrastructure.
44.
There is scope for further improvements in economic statistics, particularly in the
area of national accounts, compilation of the International Investment Position, application of a
budget classification consistent with GFSM 2001, labor market statistics and real estate statistics.
45.
It is recommended that the next Article IV consultation take place on the standard
12-month cycle “in accordance with the Decision on Article IV Consultation Cycles
(Decision No.14747-(10/96) as amended.”

Appendix I. Exchange Rate Assessment
The real exchange rate is currently estimated to be in line with fundamentals. Medium-term
estimates produce mixed results but overall suggest no misalignment of the currency.

exchange rate is currently in line with its estimated long-run equilibrium. Computations of

early 2000s. The long-run equilibrium
path (predicted REER) was declining until the late 1990s and has been increasing slowly since. In
early 2013, the real exchange rate is close to its estimated equilibrium value.
2.
The external sustainability (ES) and macroeconomic balance (MB) approaches show
mixed results but suggest that overall the real exchange rate is not misaligned in the
medium term. The macroeconomic balance approach indicates that the medium-term current

estimate (14 percent). The external
sustainability approach shows a wide range of current account benchmarks, at about 12 percent
of GDP and 44 percent of GDP, implying both overvaluation and undervaluation. The benchmark
based on real per capita annuity implies an overvaluation of about 25 percent, while that based on

KUWAIT

real annuity indicates that REER is undervalued by about 26 percent. The more stringent rule (real
per capita) would suggest less spending in the medium term (in line with the PIH fiscal
sustainability benchmark), but on average, the ES approach indicates no misalignment. The MB
estimate based on the most comprehensive specification is very close to the projected current
account and implies no misalignment, either. Examining various external indicators, international
reserves have been in the range of about 6.5–7 months of imports for the past few years while the
international investment position has decreased to about 51 percent of GDP in 2012, below its
2005–2011 average of about 70 percent. Overall, the above estimates suggest that the real
exchange rate is not misaligned.

Recommendation
Clarify regulatory and supervisory responsibilities for
financial institutions between the CBK, CMA and
MOCI and initiate coordination for transition process
to new oversight architecture.
Perform periodic stress tests of real estate and other
major sectoral credit risk concentrations and review
existing assessment of the way banks consider these
risk concentrations in their Internal Capital Adequacy
Assessment Process (ICAAP).
Extend viability assessment to all systemically
important ICs.

Since the supervisory responsibility on the investment
companies was shifted to the CMA, it is suggested to address
the CMA, in this respect in order to take the necessary action
from its side.
The On-site Supervision Department prepared a manual for the
work procedures to include the ICAAP. A professional team was
formed to undertake an inspection program with the specific
purpose to focus on the local banks for examining the ICAAP.
The qualitative and quantitative capabilities of all staff working
in the supervision department shall be developed on regular
basis.
Financial Stability Office was established and supervision has
been integrated. The first Financial Stability Report has been
published.
Article (68) of Law NO. (32) of 1968 refers to the conditions to

Risk-based supervision system has been implemented in the
supervision Sector. Where, on-site inspections, in accordance
with this method, have started. And the study of banks' data,
using the Off-site Surveillance System (OSS), has started as well.
A comprehensive study was prepared about the evaluation and
classification of ICs according to the level of risk on the basis of
six qualitative factors (Stage One). Since ICs are no longer
subject to the supervision of CBK, the application of (Stage Two);
preparing corporate governance instructions, will be limited to
finance companies.
This recommendation has not been implemented because it is
not suitable for the present circumstances.
A Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) for financial crisis
management was prepared by CBK with all related authorities
(MOF, CMA, and KIA) and a work team from CBK was formed
that includes the Financial Stability Office, Supervision
Department. Research Department, Foreign Operations
Department and the Legal Office.
Collateral acceptance was widened for Emergency Lending
Assistance operations for banks, under the CBK Board
Resolution No. (91/377/2011) in its session held on 18/12/2011.
The list of guarantees, issued under CBK Board Resolution dated

to low-income countries. These include an interest-free deposit of SDR 4.2 million with a maturity at
end-2018, and a grant contribution of SDR 0.1 million to the PRGF-HIPC Trust.
Exchange Rate Arrangement:
Since May 2007, the Kuwaiti dinar has been pegged to an undisclosed currency basket, reverting to
the exchange system before January 2003. Between January 1, 2003 and May 2007, the Kuwaiti dinar
had been pegged to the U.S. dollar with a margin of 3.5 percent on either side around the parity
exchange rate of 299.63 fils/U.S. dollar. Kuwait has accepted the obligations of Article VIII, Sections
2 (a), 3, and 4, and maintains an exchange system free of restrictions on payments and transfers for

RELATIONS WITH THE WORLD BANK
(As of September 10, 2013)
The World Bank and the Government of Kuwait developed a four-year Country Partnership Strategy
(CPS) 2010–13, which leverages the setup of a World Bank Country Office in Kuwait (inaugurated in
January 2009).
The Kuwait CPS and program emphasize implementation of reforms. Hence all programs are
grounded in the Government five-year plan, and are developed closely with the line ministry/agency
as well as with the Ministry of Finance (MoF), which plays the coordinator role and the Bank’s central
counterpart.
The CPS focuses on Fee-Based Services laying the ground for Bank provision of advisory and
analytical support to Kuwait. Program priorities are driven and guided by CPS and revolve around
the following three pillars:
(i)

Improving public sector performance, with activities in the areas of reforming
procurement; fiscal management, including support for tax modernization efforts; technical
advice to stream line outdated procurement and project cycle regulation and practices,
support for several environmental initiatives, support government efforts to strengthen
policy, institutional and regulatory framework, and information systems to improve public
land management and land delivery.

(ii)

Economic diversification through increased private sector development, with support for
implementation of Kuwait’s recently passed privatization law, support to Kuwait’s Oil
Company (KPC) as it implements an ambitious privatization program, TA for a number of
public-private partnerships and the creation of a more conducive environment for private
sector development and foreign direct investment, including activities with Kuwait’s Foreign
Investment Bureau (KFIB) and an ambitious program with the Ministry of Commerce and
Industry, in support of the design and implementation of an Insolvency and Creditors Rights
framework (based on recommendations from a recent ROSC).

(iii)

Human development, with a major program to support the quality of education, including
having an international expert based in Kuwait. Potential Bank support in this area would
also include social protection and labor.

Environmental Compliance Fund (ECF). This activity responds to a request from the Kuwait
Supreme Council for the Environment, and subsequently from the Ministry of Finance, for World
Bank support in promoting improved environmental performance from point-source/industrial

KUWAIT

polluters in Kuwait through the establishment of an ECF. Bank support is consisting of helping
the EPA design an environment compliance system to assist the polluting enterprises reduce
pollution to the level required by the national standards and guidelines. Such system would
consist of the design of the following activities: (i) A Compliance Action Plan (CAP) to be
prepared by each of the polluting enterprises to reduce pollution; and (ii) A Financing Window
to be established in selected commercial banks to provide a combination of loans and grants to
the polluting enterprises in order to implement part or all the activities in the compliance action
plans (CAPs).


Project Cycle. At the request of the Ministry of Finance, the World Bank has conducted a review
of the government project cycle. Bank work helped explore ways to shorten the project cycle
and improve project management practices in Kuwait. As part of this activity, the Bank team has
reviewed and analyzed a selection of projects in government entities at three stages: concept,
implementation and evaluation. This review is helping identify bottlenecks and areas that need
amendments in procedures or regulation/legislation. The Bank is also making recommendations
to strengthen the capacity of the Government agencies to implement projects through adequate
training.



Tax Modernization Support. The World Bank is supporting efforts by the Kuwaiti Government
to modernize tax administration. The project evolved from a technical assistance activity
originally designed to help implement a Value Added Tax system in Kuwait as part of its GCC
trade union obligations. The activity aims to build capacity, which is where the involvement of
the World Bank is critical. This is being achieved through intensive training in tax operations and
modern techniques of tax administration, as well as through on-the-job training by the experts
hired by the project. This focus on strengthening a critical public sector function – tax
administration –in the context of fiscal reform makes the Bank a natural partner for the
government. An international resident advisor has been placed in Kuwait to work on this activity.



Solid Waste Management II. This activity is a follow-up to a first phase solid Waste
Management program, which aimed at improving Kuwaiti authorities understanding of the
current challenges of the solid waste sector and incited them to promote reforms to enhance
cost effectiveness of private sector participation, particularly in collection, sorting and recycling
of waste. At the request of the Municipality of Kuwait City, the Bank is engaged through this
second phase of the program to help implement the main recommendations of the first phase,
namely: (i) preparation & implementation of a national priority project for the closure and
rehabilitation of existing dumpsites, (ii) elaboration and adoption of a solid waste master plan
consistent with Kuwait Land-Use Master plan, to identify national policy & investment priorities
for the solid waste sector, (iii) completion & harmonization of existing legal instruments, starting
with a Solid Waste Law, and (iv) establishment of a municipal solid waste agency under the
municipality’s authority.



Kuwait Environmental Action Plan. This activity represents the Kuwaiti national component of
the regional initiative for the Gulf Environment Action Program (GEPAP) launched in 2009 by the
World Bank, at the meeting of the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) Environment Coordination
INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

KUWAIT

Committee in Muscat, Oman. The objective of this activity is to support Kuwait’s efforts focus on
environmental sustainability that could generate financing and economic benefits in addition to
protecting Kuwait’s natural resources in line with the State’s regional and national priorities; and
to help establish clear, transparent and predictable environmental regulations that would
improve the investment climate in Kuwait. The activity comprises three main components, which
are: (i) Implementing a cost assessment of environmental degradation as a decision making tool
for delineating policy and investment priorities based on economic and social costs of the
various forms of environmental degradation; (ii) Carrying out a pollution load assessment as a
decision support system for monitoring and enforcement of environmental regulations; and (iii)
Strengthening the environmental impact assessment system as a preventive tool for reducing
environmental and social impacts and risks.


Follow-up to the Country Procurement Assessment Report (CPAR). Building on the Bank’s
2010 CPAR report for Kuwait, the Bank is supported the MoF procurement team draft a new
comprehensive procurement law as a first step in implementing the recommendations and
action plan of the CPAR. The Bank team prepared and submitted a draft consolidated Public
Procurement Law and supported the MoF in the ratification process. The Bank team has also
provided comments on Tendering Legislation presented to the Parliament and is discussing with
MoF counterparts future capacity building support activities.



Reorganization of State Property. The objective of the activity is to assist the State of Kuwait
in the strategic understanding of the institutional and regulatory issues related to state land
policy management in Kuwait. Bank work helped develop a clear understanding of the roles and
responsibilities of various entities involved in state land management and identifying the
barriers and constraints to effective land management. Bank work is gaining prominence among
key decision makers and a presentation for the Ministerial Cabinet is planned for November
2013.



Assessment of 'Digital Oasis' project idea and support to the preparation of ICT-SME and
Outsourcing Framework. The Bank is supporting Kuwait’s Central Agency for Information
Technology (CAIT) with: (i) the assessment of the feasibility of a 'Digital Oasis' project; and, (ii)
the preparation of a framework for IT Outsourcing; and (iii) the promotion of SME's in ICT.



Public Expenditure and Financial Accountability (PEFA – Phase II) – In follow up to the PEFA
exercise conducted in FY11, MoF requested Bank support to help build capacity and improve
Ministry teams understanding of the PEFA framework and help them play a more active role in
the preparation of future PEFA assessments. The Project also aims at improving the
comprehension of the PEFA framework at the senior leadership level to help them better utilize
the framework and make informed and strategic public financial management (PFM) reform
policies that will serve the interest of the State of Kuwait.

through sector assessments. Further Bank assistance may include transaction support, public
education, and support to enhance corporate governance and post-privatization reforms.



ROSC Insolvency & Creditor Rights. Ministry for Commerce and Industry (MoCI) requested
Bank’s support in moving forward with a number of reforms to help improve Kuwait’s
investment climate starting with a review of Insolvency and Creditors Rights in Kuwait (ICR).
Bank work led to a recommendation for the need for new laws regulating Enterprise
Rehabilitation and Liquidation in Kuwait. Subsequently, a World Bank TA program has been
agreed with MoCI for the Bank to support: (i) the development of a functional workout
framework to stabilize and help recovery of Investment Companies and the enterprise sector; (ii)
reforms to improve liquidation and rehabilitation procedures, including the promotion of more
reliable access to credit information for credit providers, wider access to credit based on security
interests in movable assets, and a registry governing security interests in movable assets; and (iii)

STATISTICAL ISSUES
(As of October 3, 2013)
I.

Assessment of Data Adequacy for Surveillance

General: Data provision has some shortcomings, but is broadly adequate for surveillance. Despite further
improvements in the current year, there is scope for improved compilation of the national accounts and
balance of payments statistics through better coordination among statistical agencies. Timeliness, particularly
for the national and fiscal accounts, is an area of concern.
National Accounts and Production: Past improvements of national accounts include: change of the base year
for the constant price data to 2000 and the estimates of value added for subsidized goods and services of the
public utilities sector through the use of input costs (the household expenditure survey was used previously).
Continued progress, especially in the estimation of value added for the oil sector, requires the dedication of
adequate resources and improved coordination between the Ministries of Planning, Oil, and Finance. The IMF’s
statistics department (STA) has provided technical assistance to the Ministry of Planning to improve national
accounts and price data. It would be useful if the Central Bank of Kuwait (CBK) would publish oil sector
information in the Quarterly Statistical Bulletin pertaining to output, refining, domestic consumption, export
price for crude and refined products and the domestic price of petroleum products. These data are available
from the Ministry of Oil. Timeliness of the data needs to be improved. In the last few years, delays in the
production of price indexes caused long lags in the production of real GDP data. Recent improvements in the
compilation of statistics are expected to reduce publication lags and produce quarterly data.
Price statistics
CPI weights are based on the 2007 household expenditure survey and were introduced into the index for a
reference year of 2007. An improved monthly CPI based on a revised basket has been published in monthly CPI
bulletins with about a one-month lag. The wholesale price index (WPI) needs to be developed into a producer
price index (PPI) which is consistent with the national accounts and includes all domestically produced goods,
ex-factory, for the export and the domestic market.
Government finance statistics: Annual GFS data are reported for publication in the Government Finance
Statistics Yearbook (GFSY). The major components of extrabudgetary revenues (investment income and
transfers of profits of public institutions), extrabudgetary expenditures (interest on foreign debt and treasury
paper), and financing operations conducted by two reserve funds are not reported. Data on interest on foreign
debt and treasury paper are usually provided to Article IV consultation missions, but the regular provision of
data on investment income is lacking.
The authorities have made some progress in fiscal data presentation, but the lack of a suitable classification of
data on the execution of the budget remains a constraint on monitoring effectively fiscal developments during
the year. The authorities’ presentation is not yet fully compliant with the GFSM 2001 guidance, but progress is
being made in terms of creating a new chart of accounts and moving reporting to an accrual basis.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

9

KUWAIT

Data on the operations of the Public Institute for Social Security are not made available. Sharing of information
between various government agencies could be improved. STA has indicated to the authorities that operations
of the two reserve funds should be classified as part of government, as they perform activities for public policy
purposes (management of debt and assets, and financing of the budget). An additional extension of coverage
would be to report GFS in the form of the Statement of Sources and Uses of Cash for the consolidated central
government. The authorities have also been briefed on the IMF’s ongoing work to enhance the transparency of
fiscal accounts and presentations detailed in the “Code of Good Practices on Fiscal Transparency” and were
encouraged to adopt some of the practices recommended in the Code.
Monetary and financial statistics
The CBK reports monetary data to STA on a regular and timely basis based on the Standardized Report Forms
(SRFs). CBK needs to work further to distinguish a number of investment companies that accept deposits from
other investment companies that do not accept deposits. Investment companies that accept deposits should
appropriately be classified as part of the depository corporations sector. In the current SRFs, all investment
companies (including those that accept deposits) are classified as other financial corporations. However, the
amount of deposits accepted by investment companies is considered as not significant. The Capital Markets
Authority needs to collate and disseminate information related to investment companies.
Balance of Payments Statistics: The CBK compiles and disseminates detailed annual data in accordance with
the methodology of the BPM6, while trade data estimates are disseminated monthly. However, data on capital
flows of the nonfinancial private sector are limited. To improve coverage for inward foreign direct investment,
the CBK is making efforts to obtain more data by surveying direct investment enterprises. The Central
Statistical Office (CSO), working with the CBK, implemented the IMF’s Coordinated Direct Investment Survey in
2010-12. This initiative should improve foreign direct investment statistics. Enhancements have been made in
the estimation of travel services and communication services, but further improvements are needed in
compilation practices and in the estimation of data on several service items and private transfers.
A major step forward in 2007 was the dissemination of IIP data for 2001 onwards in STA publications. However,
the information on IIP data made available to staff is incomplete as it excludes the external assets held by the
general government due to domestic legal constraints on dissemination (however, loans granted by the
Kuwaiti Fund for Arab Economic Development and general government trade credits are included).
The CBK also participates in the Coordinated Portfolio Investment Survey (CPIS) with data reported for 2003
onwards, and in the recently introduced Coordinated Direct Investment Survey. These data are for the financial
sector acting as end-investors or as intermediaries on behalf of residents and do not include holdings of
foreign securities held by government agencies, which comprise the bulk of Kuwait’s cross-border holdings.
In 2009, STA provided TA on improving external accounts data. The CBK has made good progress since then,
particularly in the substantial revisions to report forms, including the separate reporting of financial
transactions in the BOP and other changes in volume in the international investment position. It has also made
progress in the estimation of remittances data. Yet, major delays and data gaps remain. In particular, major
government entities do not report quarterly data to the CBK in time to compile timely quarterly statistics. Trade
data are compiled by the CSO annually and provided to the CBK with a time lag of well over one year.
Furthermore, the response rate for the private nonfinancial sector is low.

Data Standards and Quality

Kuwait is one of the first GDDS participants.
However, most of its metadata, with the exception
of the real sector and socio-demographic
metadata, have not been updated since
October 2002. The CBK maintains its own
webpage where it provides the following data to
the public: money and banking statistics; balance
of payments statistics; trade balance statistics;
exchange rate; GDP by sector and expenditure at
current and constant prices; public finance
statistics; CPI and WPI; and security market
indicators. Similarly, the Ministry of Planning has a
webpage where the CSO publishes data on
national accounts, prices, and other related
statistics. The Ministry of Finance webpage
includes detailed data for actual and estimated
budget operations. In addition, the Kuwait Stock
Exchange webpage provides data on stock market
indices, volume and value of securities traded, as
well as privatization schedules and other related
information.

No data ROSC is available.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
December 2, 2013

International Monetary Fund
700 19th Street, NW
Washington, D. C. 20431 USA

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2013 Article IV Consultation with Kuwait
On November 25, 2013, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF)
concluded the Article IV consultation with Kuwait.1
High oil prices and increased production have enabled the government to continue to record high
fiscal and external surpluses and build strong buffers. Overall real non-oil gross domestic
product (GDP) growth is projected to increase modestly to 3 percent in 2013, driven by an
increase in domestic consumption and pick-up in public investment. A slight reduction in oil
production would bring down total real GDP growth below 1 percent. The overall average
consumer price inflation (CPI) is projected at 3 percent in 2013. The fiscal and external surpluses
are projected at 27 percent of GDP and 39 percent of GDP, respectively, in 2013, reflecting high
oil prices. Monetary policy has remained accommodative and bank credit growth has picked up.
Bank profitability has remained stable and soundness indicators appear strong. Banks had an
average capital adequacy ratio of 18.3 percent (Tier 1 capital of 16.6 percent) at end-June 2013.
Gross nonperforming loans declined to 4.6 percent at end-June 2013 from 5.2 percent at end2012. Banks had a provisioning ratio of 107 percent at end-June 2013. Some investment
companies continued to record losses in 2012, though of a lower order compared to 2008; a few
of these are still deleveraging and restructuring their balance sheets.
The economic outlook is expected to improve further in 2014 and over the medium term.
In 2014, non-oil growth is expected to increase to 4.4 percent supported by public capital
spending, driving average inflation to 3.5 percent. A constant level of oil production would keep
total real GDP growth below 3 percent. Fiscal and current account surpluses are expected to
remain large in 2014. Over the medium term, non-oil growth is projected to accelerate to about
5 percent as large infrastructure investments are expected to support the growth momentum. A
moderate increase in oil production is expected to further support overall growth. Inflation is
projected to increase slightly as growth picks up. The fiscal and current account surpluses are
projected to taper if spending continues on the current growth trajectory. The main downside risk
to the outlook is a sustained fall in oil prices.
1

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with members, usually
every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial information, and discusses with officials
the country's economic developments and policies. On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which
forms the basis for discussion by the Executive Board.

2
Executive Board Assessment2
Executive Directors welcomed Kuwait’s recent economic performance. High oil prices and
increased production have enabled the build-up of large fiscal and external buffers, and the nonoil sector is continuing its recovery. Nevertheless, the outlook is subject to risks from global and
regional developments, and the economy remains highly oil-dependent. Directors therefore
encouraged the authorities to make further efforts to promote economic diversification,
particularly in areas with potential for greater national employment.
Directors noted that while the fiscal position is strong, a sustained period of low oil prices could
deplete fiscal surpluses. To contain risks, free up resources for increased capital spending, and to
save for future generations, Directors agreed that it will be important to restrain current
expenditure growth, including the public sector wage bill and generalized subsidies, and to
enhance non-oil revenues. They considered that strong fiscal frameworks will be needed to guide
public spending in the medium term. In this context, strengthening the macro-fiscal unit would
support the development of a medium-term budget framework and greater efficiency of public
spending.
Directors agreed that the current accommodative monetary stance remains appropriate and the
exchange rate peg to a basket has provided a strong and credible monetary anchor. They noted
that the banking system is well regulated and resilient to shocks, and welcomed continued steps
to strengthen financial regulation and supervision. Continuous refining of the macroprudential
toolkit and greater central bank autonomy would enable the authorities to better deal with
systemic risk. Directors cautioned that the recent large consumer debt relief program could give
rise to moral hazard. Noting the continued weak balance sheets of some investment companies,
they called for the completion of the restructuring process and a review of the sector.
Directors welcomed the recent passage of important legislation that will enhance the investment
climate and forge partnerships with the private sector, and encouraged further steps in this
direction. To foster Kuwaiti employment in the private sector, Directors underscored the need to
contain public sector wage and employment growth, enhance educational quality, further
promote female labor force participation, and create an enabling environment for small and
medium enterprises. Well-functioning local debt markets could help the diversification process.
Directors also encouraged continued efforts to improve effectiveness in public administration,
and the establishment of an independent Financial Intelligence Unit.

At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the Board, summarizes the views of
Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the country's authorities. An explanation of any qualifiers

Statement by Mr. Shakour Shaalan, Executive Director for Kuwait
November 25, 2013
1.
On behalf of the Kuwaiti authorities, I would like to thank staff for their
continued constructive engagement with Kuwait. The authorities appreciate the helpful
discussions which focused on further strengthening macroeconomic and financial
stability, diversifying the economy, and promoting job creation.
Recent developments
2.
While Kuwait’s strong GDP growth reflected high oil production and prices in
recent years, the non-hydrocarbon sector has become a key contributor to growth in 2013,
driven by an increase in domestic consumption and a pick-up in public investment. The
fiscal and external accounts continued to post large surpluses, reflecting high
international oil prices. The economic outlook is expected to improve further in 2014 and
over the medium term, as large infrastructure projects are implemented. Notwithstanding
this performance, the authorities are committed to further developing the non-oil
economy while continuing to strengthen macroeconomic and financial stability.
Macroeconomic policy mix
3.
While the fiscal position is strong, the authorities are aware that increased capital
spending warrants containment of current expenditure to maintain intergenerational
equity. In order to enhance non-hydrocarbon revenue, they are in the process of
implementing an invoice system for electricity bills to improve service collection. They
are also considering the introduction of a value-added tax in coordination with other GCC
countries. On the expenditure side, the authorities concur with staff on the importance of
better targeting subsidies, and the Ministry of Finance is planning to evaluate the existing
subsidy system. They acknowledge the importance of containing wages of public
employees, but are faced with continued pressures to absorb Kuwaitis entering the
workforce, since the private sector is currently not absorbing them. The authorities
consider that garnering broad public support is important for the success of their fiscal
reforms.
4.
The authorities are committed to increasing capital spending to advance social
and physical infrastructure projects and promote non-oil growth. In this connection, they
are determined to ensure the quality and efficiency of government spending, which
entails clear prioritization and sequencing of infrastructure projects. They have already
identified and completed feasibility studies for a number of priority projects including
power stations, water waste management, and schools and hospitals that can attract
private sector participation.

5.
Monetary policy remained accommodative in the past year, in line with the
domestic and external environments. The Central Bank of Kuwait (CBK) plays a
proactive role in managing liquidity through the short- and long-term bill and bond
markets. The authorities see merit in staff’s advice to further deepen the domestic money
market, but feel that CBK transactions are currently serving the purpose of managing
liquidity in the market. The current basket pegged exchange rate regime continues to
serve the Kuwaiti economy well.
Financial stability
6.
The Kuwaiti banking system is well-regulated, well-capitalized, liquid, and
profitable. Moreover, staff’s analysis and the CBK’s stress testing results point to the
resiliency of the banking sector to severe shocks. Recent regulations introduced by the
central bank, including guidelines for the implementation of Basel III and stricter
provisioning rules, are aimed at further strengthening risk management by banks.
7.
The central bank has a range of macroprudential instruments to contain emerging
financial risks. It sees merit in staff’s recommendations to develop a more formal
macroprudential policy framework to support financial stability and to promote the
independence of the CBK. Risks to financial stability posed by investment companies
(ICs) are very negligible in view of the low exposure of banks to this sector. Local banks’
funding to ICs has continued to decline, while exposure to troubled ICs has been
contained through full provisioning. Efforts are ongoing to strengthen ICs regulations.
Recent indicators show that ICs continued to deleverage in 2013, relying on equity-debt
swaps and asset sales, and their losses in 2012 were low relative to previous years.
Economic diversification and job creation
8.
The authorities focused in recent years on further diversifying the economy and
promoting private-led growth. On the legislative front, several laws were passed that are
expected to boost private sector investments, especially the Company Law, the Direct
Investment Promotion Law, and the institutional framework for public-privatepartnership. Significant progress was also achieved in improving Kuwait’s business
environment, with the creation of special economic zones, a one-stop system to expedite
the issuance of business licenses, and a fund to finance SMEs. The authorities are
committed to further encouraging nationals to seek private sector jobs. They believe that
their focus on increasing the role of the private sector would be helpful in this regard.
