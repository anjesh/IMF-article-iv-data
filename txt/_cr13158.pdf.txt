STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2013 ARTICLE IV CONSULTATION
May 14, 2013

KEY ISSUES
Context. Donor projects, higher than average fishing license fees and remittances lifted
growth in 2012. However, the structural fiscal imbalance remains excessively large. Lack of
private sector development and underperforming state-owned enterprises (SOEs) have
exacerbated structural problems. Since 2012, the government has been pursuing a broad
range of reforms supported by the donor community to address Kiribati’s fiscal and
structural challenges.
Policy Issues. Kiribati faces a number of key challenges: a) structural fiscal imbalances are
large stemming mostly from insufficient revenue growth as well as expenditure pressures
from significant infrastructure needs and non-performing public enterprises. Weaknesses in
public financial management exacerbate the fiscal risks; b) Kiribati’s public finances and
overall economy are vulnerable to external shocks from volatile fishing license revenues
and financial exposure of its sovereign wealth and pension funds; c) Private sector
involvement in the economy is small due to remoteness and weak business climate. This
constrains growth and puts strain on public finances.
Key Policy Recommendations:
 Adhere to a fiscal policy framework that achieves a sustainable drawdown of the
sovereign wealth fund in the long run. To implement such a policy framework, it is essential
to: a) follow up with tax reform and strengthen tax compliance; b) strengthen public
financial management, including by increasing the accuracy of short and medium-term
fiscal projections and improving mechanisms for approval of government debt and
guarantees.
 Continue reform of SOEs with the goal of improving their management and promoting
commercialization of viable enterprises.
 Private sector development is a key element to both improving growth opportunities
and reducing structural fiscal imbalances. Full utilization of Kiribati’s marine potential in
particular is essential and involves developing a viable fishing industry beyond collecting
license fees. Tourism and opportunities to work abroad also hold large promise. Removing
impediments to doing business is also essential.

BACKGROUND
1.
Kiribati is one of the poorest and most remote microstates in the Pacific. It is highly
dependent on volatile fishing license fees, remittances and donor assistance. Fishing license fees
accounted, on average, for 29 percent of GDP and 50 percent of fiscal revenue in 2007–12. Kiribati
relies on its sovereign wealth fund—Revenue Equalization Reserve Fund (RERF)—for financing of the
fiscal deficit. RERF assets stood at about 3½ times of GDP in 2012.1
2.
Fiscal risks and sustainability have worsened in recent years. Since the mid–2000s,
revenues have not kept pace with expenditures, leading to increased demands on RERF financing.
Tax revenue has declined as a share of GDP largely due to poor compliance and problematic SOEs,
while non-tax revenue stagnated. At the same time, expenditures were not contained in line with
revenue trends, leading to large and excessive current fiscal deficits and high financing demands on
the RERF. Obligations related to underperforming SOEs have exacerbated the problem. As a result,
the RERF drawdowns to finance the budget have become unsustainable, putting the RERF on a
declining path as a share of GDP and in per capita terms. Besides RERF financing, until recently the
government had resorted to expensive commercial borrowing, which had in turn worsened fiscal
dynamics further.
3.
The Government of Kiribati realized the magnitude of the problems and with the help of
donor community has embarked on a broad range of reforms to address its fiscal and
structural challenges. In 2012, the government cleared most of the overdraft facilities following the
IMF advice and technical assistance (TA), thereby reducing its interest cost. Ongoing reforms cover
various areas: public financial management, tax system, SOEs, and the private sector. Successful
implementation of these reforms increases the likelihood of higher donor financing, including
budget support in the form of grants. Discussions on such financing are ongoing. These reforms are
also consistent with the IMF advice provided during the 2011 Article IV consultation and subsequent
staff visits.2
4.
The IMF has been actively involved in all relevant aspects of the government-led reform
program in coordination with the World Bank, AsDB, AusAid and other development partners.
The Fund has provided macroeconomic, fiscal, and debt sustainability assessments and projections.
IMF experts from headquarters and PFTAC have provided TA in the area of public financial

The Revenue Equalization Reserve Fund (RERF) is a sovereign wealth fund established in 1956 and capitalized using
phosphate mining proceeds before phosphate deposits were exhausted in 1979. It is one of the main sources of fiscal
income and budget financing for Kiribati.
2

After the 2011 Article IV consultation, there were two staff visits in January and June 2012. The main
recommendations of the consultation and the staff visits included: the call for fiscal consolidation to ensure fiscal
sustainability and to preserve the value of the RERF; acceleration of the structural reform agenda, including reform of
the SOEs; and implementing measures to promote private sector development through simplification of business
procedures and improving access to land. The staff visits focused in particular on addressing growing fiscal
imbalances following adverse fiscal outturns. To address such imbalances, the staff called for strengthening tax
administration, expanding the tax base by introducing broad base value added tax (VAT), restraining current
expenditure, and eliminating the need for non-concessional borrowing. The June 2012 staff visit proposed clearing
government outstanding commercial debt and embarking on a strong reform program supported by development
partners, which would help attract donor budget support.

management, management of the RERF and the pension fund (KPF), national accounts, government
finance, and external statistics.

OUTLOOK
5.
Growth increased to 2.8 percent in 2012, reflecting implementation of donor projects,
higher than average fishing license fees and remittances. Airport and sea-port construction
projects in particular boosted construction activities. Nevertheless, inflation remained negative on
account of lower prices of rice and some other staples. The revenue from fishing licenses was much
higher than average, but is expected to decline in the period ahead.
6.
The current account deficit widened slightly in 2012 mostly because of an increase in
imports, which was partially offset by high fishing license fees. The high level of imports was
mostly due to the surge in imports of machinery and equipment associated with donor projects. At
the same time, the value of the food imports declined slightly reflecting moderating prices on some
main staples in line with world trends. Remittances, which are dominated by transfers from seamen,
also dropped, due to the slowdown in the world shipping activity. Income on the RERF was stable,
reflecting in particular favorable relative yields on Australian assets.

The economy will continue to expand at rates close to 3 percent in the next two years,
supported by donor projects and construction activities. The road project, renovation of the
airport, expansion of oil storage terminals, and continuing port renovation will expand local
employment and income. Inflation is projected at 2–2.5 percent.
8.
The risks in the external environment may affect the outlook (see risk assessment matrix).
They include a slowdown in some of the main world economies that could lead to a decline in RERF
assets and remittances, and price shocks that would increase value of imports. The main risks in the
medium term relate to the adverse growth and fiscal implications in case domestic reforms lack
progress.

POLICIES TO ACHIEVE FISCAL SUSTAINABILITY AND
PROMOTE LONG-TERM GROWTH
Key policy challenges are in reducing structural fiscal imbalances and increasing growth opportunities,
in particular for private sector growth. These challenges are interconnected because private sector
growth is vital for reducing the fiscal burden.

A. Fiscal Policy
Background
9.
Since the mid-2000s, the fiscal position has worsened as revenues stagnated and
expenditures were not adjusted to reflect lower revenues. Tax revenues declined because of poor
compliance and non-performing SOEs. Non-tax revenue stagnated mainly because fishing license
fees and other fees did not keep up with GDP growth and have been on a declining trend in real
terms.3 The wage bill constituted about one half of the current expenditure. Subsidies were
dominated by those for copra and SOEs. Underperforming SOEs put additional fiscal pressure
through their debt which was guaranteed by the government.
10.
The worsening fiscal position led to high current deficits financed by unsustainable
RERF drawdowns and non-concessional borrowing.4 By 2011–12, the RERF balance, in constant
per capita terms, was almost half of its amount in 2000. The government accumulated significant
non-concessional debt from its overdraft facility with the commercial bank (ANZ) and from taking on
debt guarantees of the SOEs. By mid-2012, the government overdraft with the commercial bank
stood at A$22½ million (13½ percent of GDP) and the SOEs’ overdraft (mostly guaranteed by the
government) at A$11¾ million (7 percent of GDP).
11.
Consistent with the advice of the IMF staff, which was supported by the donor
community, the government cleared its overdraft and other non-concessional debt in 2012
3

While fishing license fees were significantly higher in 2012 due to one off factors, such an outcome cannot be
sustained in the long run.
4

For the purpose of this report, the current fiscal deficit is defined as the deficit that excludes development
expenditures financed by donors and corresponding development grants on the revenue side. It is a better indicator
of the fiscal position and financing demands on Kiribati government than the overall deficit. The current deficit in this
definition also corresponds to the concept that the government uses for its budget.

using the RERF. The government’s repayment of its overdraft debt of about A$26 million has
reduced interest costs by about A$2⅓ million per year.
12.
The 2013 budget implies a current fiscal deficit of about 18⅓ percent of GDP, assuming
conservative projections for fishing license revenue. The budget factors in an increase of about
6 percent in the wage bill including other employee allowances and a similar level of subsidies
compared to the 2012 budget. Assuming about A$5 million of budget support from donors and no
commercial borrowing, the financing requirement implies a RERF drawdown of about A$27 million or
15.4 percent of GDP leading to a further decline in the RERF per capita balance.
13.
The government has been undertaking a broad range of reforms to reduce fiscal
imbalances and improve fiscal planning and execution with the assistance of development
partners, including:


The government plans to introduce value added and excise taxes in the first half of 2014 and
has been preparing the framework and draft legislation for these taxes with the assistance of
PFTAC.



A revision of the public finance regulation act has been prepared and is ready for official
approval. Revised regulations would strengthen procedures for budget execution, reporting
and auditing.



The parliament passed an SOE bill establishing a strengthened legal framework for governance,
financial reporting, and management of SOEs.



The government with the help of the AsDB and PFTAC has been upgrading its fiscal
information systems to improve accountability and functionality.



Work is underway to improve Kiribati’s fisheries policy (with the assistance of Australian TA).



The government plans to introduce improvements in RERF management and asset allocations,
with the support of technical assistance.

Based on the reform program, the government has been discussing with the World Bank, AusAid,
AsDB, and the European Union budget grant support for 2013 and 2014.

The stronger reform scenario incorporates additional
fiscal measures to stabilize RERF per capita values by
2021–22 at slightly below A$4,000 in constant terms.
Such stabilization will be difficult to achieve, requiring
a narrowing of current fiscal deficit of more than
15 percent of GDP, distributed broadly between taxes,
wages, and other expenditure measures. The scenario
also assumes some improvement in fishing license fees
revenues through better pricing. The adjustment
period is appropriate given the magnitude of fiscal
adjustment, capacity constraints and the time needed
to implement fiscal and structural reforms. The current
fiscal deficit under this scenario will be limited to
2⅔ percent of GDP on average in 2022–30. Stronger
reforms would allow Kiribati to finance a greater
proportion of development financing needs through
grants and reduce the risk of debt distress according to
the debt sustainability analysis.

Baseline Scenario: Current Deficit and RERF Balance

2015



The baseline scenario incorporates the authorities’
current commitments to reform, assumes the
introduction of value added and excise taxes (with
implementation adjustment), and assumes that current
expenditures will grow more slowly than nominal GDP
in the medium and longer term. The baseline scenario
also incorporates donor budget support in the amount
of A$5 million under the reform program in 2013–14.
Under this scenario, the current fiscal deficit will be
reduced from 18.2 percent of GDP in 2013 to 9⅓
percent of GDP in 2018 and to about 8⅓ percent in
the longer run. The RERF drawdown would be reduced
from 15.4 percent of GDP to 8⅓ percent of GDP
correspondingly. Despite significant narrowing of the
current fiscal deficit by about 10 percent of GDP under
this scenario, the RERF per capita value does not
stabilize and declines by more than 40 percent by 2030
compared to the 2011 level. The debt sustainability
analysis points to a high risk of debt distress under this
scenario.

2014



Source: IMF staff estimate.

The downside policy stagnation scenario, which assumes that the current fiscal deficits will remain at
the 2013 level in relation to GDP, leads to a much worse outcome. Under this scenario, not only will the
per capita RERF balance fail to stabilize, but RERF assets will eventually be depleted.

Staff welcomed the authorities’ commitment to tax reform. Implementation challenges
are significant and need to be addressed promptly. The challenges include finalizing modalities of
VAT application, and provision of necessary equipment and software.
16.
Maintaining sufficient growth of fishing license revenues while abiding by
international commitments and managing their volatility is very important. An increase in the
minimum price of fishing licenses from US$5,000 to US$6,000 per day for 2014 should strengthen
the near-term fishing license revenue outlook. Nevertheless, as the regional Nauru Agreement sets
only minimum prices, it may be helpful to consider ways to improve current negotiating processes
with the fishing companies by using international expert advice. In the longer run, developing a
viable local commercial fishing industry and going beyond fishing license fees is vital for both lifting
growth and living standards and reducing fiscal imbalances.

reduce the cost in the near and medium
term. SOE subsidies are currently dominated by those for the Public Utilities Board (PUB) and airfares.
Given that the PUB has been underperforming and running arrears, a reduction in the PUB subsidy
can only be implemented after restoring the PUB performance. The reduction in airfare subsidies is
complicated by the need to maintain links with remote islands and limited airline competition.
Climate change impact and infrastructure pressures can result in additional costs.
18.
The policy of avoiding non-concessional financing of the recurrent deficit should
continue. The clearance of overdraft facilities substantially reduced the borrowing costs by more
than A$2 million per year. As borrowing costs on commercial debt are substantially higher than the
return on RERF investments, borrowing on commercial terms should be avoided under the
government’s debt and asset management strategy.
19.
Implementation of a sound public financial management framework is critical to
restoring fiscal sustainability. Such a framework would ensure the formulation and execution of
sustainable budgets over the medium and long term and corresponding RERF drawdowns over the
long run. In this context, it is also important to adopt a prudent policy on contracting and
guaranteeing debt and to strengthen revenue and expenditure projections. Staff welcomed the
authorities’ decision to seek technical assistance in these areas.

KIRIBATI

Authorities’ Views
20.
The authorities were in broad agreement with the mission’s recommendations. They
agreed that maintaining fiscal sustainability and preserving the value of the RERF is a priority. They
intend to introduce necessary revenue measures and to limit current expenditure, including the wage
bill. The authorities also pointed out that they continue to avoid overdraft borrowing for the
budgetary needs and have reduced the amount of guarantees to SOEs. At the same time, the
authorities noted the potential spending needed to replace vessels, improve infrastructure on the
outer islands, and address the negative impact of climate change.
21.
The authorities intend to introduce a VAT in the first half 2014. The VAT would initially
be levied on the largest businesses with high turnover, which would ease somewhat the
implementation process. The authorities hoped that development partners would speed up the
delivery of needed equipment and requested technical assistance to study the welfare impact of
introducing the VAT.
22.
The authorities acknowledged that the high fishing license revenue in 2012 is not
sustainable. They recognized the importance of such revenues for the budget and noted that fishing
companies are aware of the government’s reliance on fishing license revenues and have use that to
bid for the lowest fees. The authorities also contended that since the regional Nauru Agreement sets
the minimum price for licenses, most companies bid around this minimum price. They agreed that
the development of the local fishing industry beyond license fees is very important for increasing
economic growth and improving fiscal outcomes. With regard to the smoothing mechanism for
fishing licenses, the authorities noted their preference for conservative projections for fishing license
fees in the budget in order to avoid possible shortfalls.

B. State-owned Enterprises Reforms
Background
23.
The government has been implementing SOE reforms with the assistance of the AsDB.
After a stock-taking in 2012, it has proposed action plans for non-performing SOEs. Private-public
partnership (PPP) agreements have been designed to support the continued operation of some
SOEs, while others have been identified as candidates for either sale, liquidation or future jointventures. These action plans have been implemented for a number of companies.5 The SOE bill that
provides an improved governance framework for SOEs was passed at the April 2013 session of
parliament. The cabinet has also submitted to parliament legislation to liberalize and increase
competition in the telecommunication sector.
24.
Some important SOEs continue to underperform. In particular, the PUB has been
operating at a loss, consistently accumulating arrears. The company’s largest arrears are owed to the
Kiribati Oil Company (KOIL), totaling in excess of A$5 million. The government’s current strategy aims
at improving collection and compliance via the installation of new meters and use of prepaid
schemes, without raising tariffs.

The Kiribati Supply Company Limited was successfully sold at the end of 2011, while the wholesale and retail
company Bobotin Kiribati Limited was approved for sale late last year. A privatization tender has been issued for the
Otintaai hotel. Betio Shipyards Limited is a likely candidate for PPP or joint ventures.

Staff Views
25.
Staff welcomed the SOE reforms undertaken by the government with the assistance of
the AsDB. The stocktaking of the SOE performance and restructuring should improve efficiency and
reduce costs. The SOE bill will help improve the governance. Measures towards commercialization of
SOEs also hold potential. Efforts to expand renewable energy sources are commendable.
26.
While the government has made impressive progress in reforming SOEs, a number of
important issues still need to be tackled. Staff recommended evaluating the effectiveness and
magnitude of increased revenue collections by the PUB, with due consideration for additional
revenue measures if needed. Improving the framework for the government’s debt and guarantee
policy would help keep guarantees within acceptable limits and reduce the fiscal risks to the
government.
Authorities’ Views
27.
The authorities stressed that they will continue with the process of reforming SOEs.
They pointed out that the PUB finances can be substantially improved with higher revenue collection,
without raising tariffs. They also intend to introduce an improved debt and guarantee framework.
28.
The government recognizes that certain SOE services may not be taken up by private
sector players, given economy of scale considerations. The authorities opted to continue to
manage the Kiribati Shipping Services Limited (KSSL), instead of completely contracting services out
to the private sector. Larger boats are needed for shipping to the outer islands, costs for which only
the public sector is able to bear at this stage.

C. Increasing Private Sector Growth Opportunities
Background
29.
Kiribati’s private sector is small, in part due to the country’s limited production base,
remoteness, and high transport costs. Major private sector activities include fisheries, tourism,
retail trade and copra, with the exports base largely limited to fisheries and copra. Tourism activity is
dominated by game fishing at Kiritimati Island. The agricultural sector mainly consists of subsidized
copra production and subsistence agriculture. In addition, to improve food security, the government
has encouraged the growing of longer-term crops including breadfruit and big taro.
30.
The current domestic fishing industry is small and fishing license fees account for most
of the revenues from fishing resources. The recently opened joint venture processing plant
employs modern technology and has created employment and income opportunities. However, local
fishermen still remain ill-equipped to meet a steadily rising demand for fish. In addition, the limited
numbers of international flights to Kiribati have resulted in high charges for higher-priced fresh fish
exports.

A significant part of Kiribati’s national income is in the form of worker remittances
from abroad. The country’s Marine Training Center (MTC) prepares seamen mostly for work on
foreign freight lines while the Fisheries Training Center (FTC) focuses on training for work on fishing
vessels. Seamen remittances were on average 5 percent of GDP in 2005–12, while the number of
seamen on board averaged over 8,000 from 2005–11.

Given the limited potential for agricultural and manufacturing development, the

fisheries—provide the greatest potential for increased growth in the island economy. Currently

KIRIBATI

Kiribati receives only a small share of the value of fish caught in its waters. The authorities should aim
to increase the value added from fishing resources by expanding the local fishing industry in addition
to relying on fishing license fees (Box 2).
Box 2. Kiribati: Utilizing Fishing Resources
Kiribati has some of the most productive tuna fishing grounds in the region. It accounts for, on average,
over 20 percent of the value of total catch in national waters in the Pacific island countries during 2000–11.
Fishing license revenues are a key income source for Kiribati. Over the last decade, fishing license
revenues average 45 percent of current fiscal revenues, the highest among regional peers. Fishing license
revenues have been volatile, varying from 18 percent

to 34½ percent of GDP during the past 10 years.

To utilize this untapped potential, Kiribati could
promote investment, job creation and export
generation in its fishing industry beyond securing
license revenues. Consider Iceland, another country
with abundant marine resource, as a comparison.
Iceland has a much developed fishing industry that
brings higher return per value of the catch. Simple
calculation shows that the value of by-product from
fishing processing in Iceland is on average six times
higher than the fishing license fees Kiribati receives
from each metric ton of fish catch (Figure). To increase
proceeds from fishing resources, Kiribati should
encourage private sector investment in onshore marine
processing. Some progress has been made in recent
years. Kiribati Fish Ltd., a joint venture for marine
processing with Chinese and Fijian fishing companies,
has become operational at end-2012. It processes
sashimi for the Japanese and US markets, and creates
job opportunities for locals. To ensure a viable
domestic fishing industry, improving infrastructure and
business climate, and removing obstacles for doing
business are essential.

While fiscally important, fishing license revenues
account for less than 10 percent of the value of fish
catch in Kiribati waters, indicating the untapped
potential of Kiribati’s fishing resources (Figure). In
fact the value of fish catch in Kiribati waters exceeds
the total Kiribati GDP more than twice, and exceeds
value added in the domestic fishing industry plus
fishing license fees by more than nine times (Figure).

Current and planned improvements to infrastructure should strengthen general
economic activity and opportunities for tourism. There is a potential for tourism outside of
Tarawa, particularly in Kiritimati Island, and the Phoenix and Line islands.
34.
Removing obstacles for doing business and improving the business climate is essential
for private business growth (Box 3). Kiribati ranks low compared to its Pacific islands peers in a
number of doing business indicators - including time to get electricity and construction permits, and
access to land and credit. Nevertheless, there is scope for the government to shorten and
standardize the business applications process, and reduce red tape.
Authorities’ Views
35.
The authorities agreed that increasing private sector participation in the economy and
promoting its robust growth is critical for improving Kiribati’s long-term growth prospects. In
particular, they indicated that the development of a robust the local fishing industry is key to fully
utilizing Kiribati’s abundant marine resources.
36.
Working and studying abroad is essential given limited local employment
opportunities. High airfare costs associated with a single major airline carrier has put Kiribati’s
workers, in particular seamen and seasonal workers, and students abroad, at a disadvantage. The
authorities also hoped that the foreign quotas for Kiribati’s students and workers will be increased in
the near term.
Box 3. Kiribati: Supporting Private Sector Growth
Streamlining business and investment approval processes and reducing business costs are important for
attracting and securing both foreign and domestic investment. Cumbersome procedures and high
establishment costs, amongst other factors, place Kiribati in low ranking among regional neighbors for starting
a business. The government is currently finalizing its National Private Sector Development Strategy that would
facilitate the introduction of a ‘one-stop shop’ concept for investment approvals.
Accessing land, together with obtaining licenses, is one of the biggest impediments to starting a business
in the business survey. Enforcing contracts appears to be quite a lengthy process in Kiribati and improvements to
enforcement of property rights and speedier settlement of court settlement procedures, in particular for those
relating to land, should help

indications are that the KPF SLS has contributed to private sector lending. Regarding the balance
sheet, the KPF has accumulated the deficit of more than A$ 20 million as members’ balances exceed

Staff’s Views
39.
Strengthening institutional arrangements with regard to access to land would help
boost financial intermediation. The authorities are encouraged to enact the relevant laws and
procedures that will facilitate collateral recovery, improve and enhance secured borrowing.
Increasing access to credit for viable private sector projects is important. Introducing microfinance

schemes and improving financial literacy may be promising as some start-up business lack proper
financial records that disqualify them for formal bank loans.
40.
At the same time, lending standards and risk management need to be maintained and
strengthened in those institutions with high share of non-performing loans. Such frameworks
need to be implemented in the absence of a separate financial supervisory authority.
41.
Restoring an operating surplus at the KPF will be important to ensure the sustainability
of the pension fund’s operations. While rebuilding the financial position of the pension fund may
take some time, in the immediate future, the KPF is advised to avoid setting rates of return on
members’ balances in excess of returns on its investments.
Authorities’ Views
42.
There was general agreement about the impediments to increased financial
intermediation, particularly for the private sector. While increased competition may be harder to
introduce in the short term given high establishment costs, the authorities recognize that better
management of current lending practices are important for ensuring the stability of the financial
sector. In that vein, officials were interested in technical assistance in risk management and improved
asset allocation.

E. External Competiveness and Exchange Rate Assessment
43.
The Australian dollar circulates as legal tender. Kiribati has accepted the obligations of
Article VIII, Sections 2, 3, and 4 and maintains an exchange system free of restrictions on payments
and transfers for current international transactions.

Reflecting the strength of Australian dollar, the real effective exchange rate (REER) is
well above its long run average despite

provided a strong nominal anchor, given
Kiribati’s close linkages with Australia and in light of its limited capacity to conduct its own monetary
policy. The reforms aimed at boosting private sector growth discussed above will be crucial to
improving and maintaining competitiveness following the strengthening of the REER. The current
account deficit in relation to GDP is largely driven over the medium term by fiscal policy. Consistent
with this, the projected fiscal consolidation in the coming years will also be important to help narrow
the trade deficit.

KIRIBATI

STAFF APPRAISAL
46.
Kiribati’s challenge is to implement fiscal and structural reforms to help ensure fiscal
sustainability, promote private sector development, and increase its resilience to external
shocks. These reforms, in combination with the large developments projects financed by foreign
partners, will help support favorable medium-term growth prospects. Steady implementation will be
the key.
47.
Restoring fiscal sustainability and stabilizing per capita RERF balances will require
significant fiscal effort in the medium and longer term. Strong revenue measures are necessary
while adjustments on the expenditure side would need to accommodate the need to maintain
adequate health and education systems, communication lines, and adapt to climate change. The
authorities are urged to press ahead with plans to adopt a VAT, which is urgently needed to increase
revenues. Sound public financial management is essential. Steps are needed to improve fiscal
projections. Consistent with adoption of a prudent borrowing and debt guarantee policy, Kiribati
should avoid commercial borrowing to finance its budget.
48.
Making subsidies more efficient would help reduce risks to the budget and align
incentives. Over the medium term, subsidies should be streamlined and subject to better targeting.
These reforms will need to recognize the impact that subsidies are having in the short term to
support infrastructures and communications, as well as the importance of copra subsidy in
supporting the livelihood of outer islands inhabitants.
49.
SOE reforms have helped resolve a number of problem enterprises and reduced fiscal
exposure. These reforms should continue. However, underperformance of some important SOEs
remains a significant concern. In particular, the Public Utility Company needs to increase revenues
and clear arrears. The current strategy of raising payment compliance to achieve this goal needs to
be reviewed periodically.
50.
Maintaining sufficient growth of fishing license revenues while abiding by
international commitments and managing their volatility is very important. Many factors
outside of Kiribati’s control combine to influence the volatility of fishing license revenues.
Nevertheless it would be beneficial to explore the possibilities of improving license pricing
mechanisms using international best practices and experience.
51.
Fully utilizing marine potential beyond fishing license fees will be important to
improve fiscal revenues and growth opportunities. Kiribati’s small share of the value of the fish
catch in its waters points to the potential to further develop this sector to expand the tax base, widen
local employment opportunities, and enhance overall growth potential.
52.
More generally private sector development is critical for both lifting growth and
reducing fiscal pressures. Improving the management and development of Kiribati’s marine
resources, developing the tourism industry, and expanding opportunities for studying and working
abroad provide the greatest economic potential. Removing obstacles for doing business is of utmost
importance.
53.

It is proposed that Kiribati be moved to the 12 month Article IV cycle in light of

continuing fiscal and structural challenges and vulnerabilities.

RELATIONS WITH THE PACIFIC FINANCIAL TECHNICAL
ASSISTANCE CENTRE (PFTAC)
1

(As of April, 2013)
During the current funding cycle (May 2011 to May 2014), PFTAC assistance to Kiribati has included
advisory missions. Kiribati also sent 11 officials to regional seminars and workshops.
Tax Administration and Policy
In 2003, PFTAC recommended several reforms. These included: a value-added tax (VAT);
a presumptive tax; and a single ad valorem tax on imports from non Pacific countries; simplified
personal income tax (PIT); single rate of corporate income tax (CIT). A steering committee was
established to manage the introduction of the reforms. In 2009, a subsequent review mission was
provided to update tax recommendations.
In February 2009, the cabinet approved the introduction of legislation to treat income tax
deductions from salary and wages (PAYE) as a final tax. This change has now been implemented, but
further TA may be necessary to ensure that the change operates effectively.
Cabinet has also given approval “in principle” to implementation new regimes for VAT and excise tax
and revenue administration. PFTAC has provided TA to prepare the draft legislation and will provide
TA to assist in implementation. Cabinet has reviewed the legislation and the first reading of the Bill
is anticipated in late April 2013. Cabinet had indicated that the VAT would commence in January
2014, but this dependant on safe passage of the bill through Parliament no later than August 2013.
PFTAC stands ready to continue to assist the authorities with VAT implementation; reviewing
existing income tax business process; and implementing new automated business processing
(Revenue Management System v7).
Public Financial Management (PFM)
An August 2011 mission to Kiribati assisted the Ministry of Finance in prioritizing its PFM reform
activities, and provided a framework for the current joint AusAid/AsDB long-term TA. Prior to the
inception of that TA, two PFTAC/IMF missions worked with the Ministry of Finance officials to modify
their chart-of-accounts to capture more information on donor-funded projects, to improve the
integration of planning and budgeting, and to provide options for better cash and debt
management. In addition, PFTAC’s PFM Advisors participated in the August 2012 AsDB/AusAid
Technical Assistance inception mission, and a concurrent donor forum.

PFTAC in Suva, Fiji is a multi-donor TA institution, financed by IMF, AsDB, AusAID, and NZAID, with the IMF AS
Executing Agency. The Centre’s aim is to build skills and institutional capacity for effective economic and financial
management that can be sustained at the national level. Member countries are: Cook Islands, Federated States of
Micronesia, Fiji, Kiribati, Marshall Islands, Nauru, Niue, Palau, Papua New Guinea, Samoa, Solomon Islands, Tokelau,
Tonga, Tuvalu, and Vanuatu.

PFTAC is ready to provide additional technical support on budget preparation, cash/debt
management, and other aspects of budget execution. Officials from Kiribati have regularly
participated in PFTAC’s regional PFM events, including the November 2011 MTB workshop, the July
2012 PEFA Workshop, the Strategic Development Program Workshops (with Australia DOFD), and
the PIFMA Heads meetings.
Financial Sector Regulation and Supervision
In August 2003, the PFTAC advisor and an IMF legal expert visited Kiribati to conduct consultations
with industry and government officials on a Financial Institutions Bill that had been drafted in July
2002. Responses to comments raised by the authorities, together with appropriately amended draft
legislation, were forwarded to the authorities in December 2003 for action.
To date there has been no further progress on the draft Financial Institutions Bill or the previously
drafted Anti-money Laundering Legislation. The PFTAC advisor makes periodic contact with the
Ministry of Finance regarding the status of the draft legislation.
Economic and Financial Statistics
GDDS metadata was first published on the IMF website in April 2004 and subsequently updated in
March 2013, following assistance by PFTAC. A brief mission was undertaken in August 2006 to
assess TA needs. The BOP compiler benefited from training provided in regional courses in 2005 and
2010. PFTAC provided TA on balance of payments in 2008, 2010 and 2012, improving compilation
methods and use of source data, as well as providing training, and helping with the transition to
BPM6.
PFTAC provided TA on national accounts (NA) in 2008, 2009, 2010, and 2013, assisting the
authorities in making significant improvements in methodology and use of source data. Beginning
in 2012, PFTAC is assisting with the development of an expenditure measure of GDP. The NA
compiler benefited from regional courses in 2009 and 2012. PFTAC also sponsored a one-month
attachment for the BOP compiler with Statistics New Zealand in May 2009.
Macroeconomic Analysis
Two missions in 2011 provided assistance in building capacity related to basic forecasting
techniques, using the medium-term fiscal framework developed as part of ADB assistance, and
assessing sustainable levels of drawdowns from Kiribati’s Reserve Equalization Reserve Fund.
A regional financial programming workshop held jointly in 2012 by PFTAC and the Singapore
Regional Training Institute provided training in financial programming techniques to two
economists of the Ministry of Finance and Economic Development.

BANK-FUND COLLABORATION
A. World Bank-IMF Collaboration
(As of April 30, 2013)
The Fund and the Bank teams maintain close cooperation in various areas and consult frequently.
During the current cycle, the Bank staff has joined the IMF missions, including IMF staff visits and the
2013 Article IV mission. The IMF staff and the World Bank staff maintained continuing closed
dialogue on the economic developments and aspects and components of the government reform
program.
During the current cycle, the teams have produced a Joint DSA. The IMF team provided analysis and
advice on the overall macroeconomic and fiscal framework, including fiscal and RERF sustainability.
The IMF and World Bank have also provided technical assistance on the government borrowing and
overdraft. Using this advice, the government has cleared expensive non-concessional debt in the
end of 2012 and reduced borrowing costs. The Fund also provided technical assistance on statistical
issues, including Government Finance Statistics and Balance of Payments. The Bank has been
engaged in various infrastructure projects, including road rehabilitation, airport improvement, solar
energy, and adaptation to climate change. Bank staff provided technical assistance on government
expenditures, reforms of copra subsidy and import levy fund, liberalization of telecommunication
sector, management of RERF assets, and social protection issues. The Bank has worked closely with
the government to identify comprehensive program of priority economic reforms, and supported
coordination of donor TA around the reform agenda. Reforms identified through this process are
now being supported under joint donor budget support, coordinated by the World Bank.
The IMF and World Bank teams will continue close cooperation going forward, in particular in the
context of the government reform program. As agreed earlier, the Fund will continue to lead on
macro issues, in particular overall macroeconomic framework, including in the medium-and-longer
term, and the Bank on macro-critical structural reform issues.1 The Fund and the Bank staff will also
cooperate with regard to follow up TA on the RERF management.

B. Relations with the World Bank Group2
Kiribati became a member of the World Bank Group in 1986.
On March 1, 2011, the World Bank’s Board of Executive Directors discussed the first Country
Assistance Strategy (CAS) for Kiribati, which had previously been covered by a Pacific Islands
Regional Engagement Framework. The CAS is structured around the themes of: (i) addressing the
existential threat posed by climate change; and, (ii) mitigating the effects of geographic isolation.
The CAS anticipates a significantly expanded program of advisory and financial support for Kiribati.
Consistent with Kiribati’s limited repayment capacity highlighted in the DSA, it is anticipated that
IDA financing will be provided on 100-percent grant terms. IDA grants and trust fund investments of
as much as US$50 million are anticipated over the four year CAS period from FY2011 to FY2014.
Such a program of investments is intended to build a foundation for the World Bank to play a more
substantive role, in close collaboration with the IMF and other donor partners, in a coordinated
economic policy dialogue with the Government of Kiribati.
Key components of proposed World Bank Group engagement include:
 Climate change adaptation and building resilience against shocks is at the core of Bank
engagement in Kiribati. The Bank, with trust fund financing, has been supporting climate change
mitigation since 2003 through the Kiribati Adaptation Program (KAP). Trust fund financing of US$7–
10 million has been agreed in principle for KAP 3 from GEF, GFDRR, Australia, and, potentially, New
Zealand. This will involve a significant scale up compared to previous phases. Activities will focus on
seawalls, mangrove planting, and water conservation and supply. In addition to KAP, the Bank is
proposing to work with the government and other donors to consider options for an integrated
program in the water sector, which is the key issue where the climate change and development
agendas intersect in Kiribati. Kiribati’s already limited supply of fresh water adversely affects
development outcomes, and population growth and the impact of climate change is likely to put
further pressure on this critical resource. Beyond climate change adaptation, the Bank is committed
to accelerating efforts to address wider issues of vulnerability in Kiribati, including accessing trust
fund resources to improve renewable energy generation to reduce reliance on volatile imported
diesel, and to support the transport of food to remote outer islands.
 Mitigating the effects of geographic isolation. Given Kiribati’s remoteness, the Bank anticipates
scaling up support for climate friendly infrastructure investments. A South Tarawa road
improvement investment of US$24m in IDA and TF financing— undertaken jointly with the AsDB—
was approved by the Board on March 1, 2011, with the Kiribati CAS. The Bank has also mobilized
significant grant resources with New Zealand and other partners, to help bring Kiribati airports–
a vital link with the outside world–up to international safety standards.
 Supporting economic reform and regional integration. An expanded program of investments
has provided a foundation for a more substantive engagement by the Bank Group in a coordinated

economic policy dialogue in Kiribati. The World Bank is now preparing a budget support operation
to support key public finance and structural reforms identified through the economic dialogue
process. The Bank Group is supporting government efforts to open the telecoms market to new
private investments. As well as the direct benefits, telecoms reform has elsewhere in the Pacific
proven to be especially successful in building public support and momentum for reform more
broadly. The Bank and IFC will cooperate closely in supporting other potential SOE transactions,
including the introduction of private participation in the management of the Otintaai hotel. As well
as domestic reform, the Bank Group continues to support efforts by Kiribati and other Pacific Island
countries to gain benefits from greater regional integration, including participation in temporary
labor migration schemes established by New Zealand and Australia and anticipated analytical and
investment support to help countries improve management and returns from pelagic and deep-sea
fishery resources.

RELATIONS WITH THE ASIAN DEVELOPMENT BANK 1
The Asian Development Bank has approved eight project loans to Kiribati amounting to
US$34.7 million, all from Asian Development Fund (ADF) resources since Kiribati joined the AsDB in
1974. In addition, TA amounting to US$18.95 million has been provided for 38 projects. The latest
AsDB loan to Kiribati, for South Tarawa Sanitation Improvement Sector project, was approved in
October 2011. The AsDB most recently approved an US$0.8 million TA grant for a strengthening
Public Financial Management in December 2011. AusAID provided $1 million cofinancing.
The strategy of the AsDB in Kiribati directly supports the government's Kiribati Development Plan (KDP).
Further, AsDB’s approach is anchored in the mid-term review of the Pacific Strategy, which put a stronger
emphasis on issues of supporting a conducive environment for private sector development, good
governance, and capacity development. Rapid population growth and urban migration has left Kiribati
with overcrowded urban areas, and its most pressing development challenges are social and
environmental concerns, including the impacts of climate change, access to clean water and sanitation,
and the spread of HIV/AIDS. The AsDB supports the government’s efforts to balance growth more evenly
throughout the country through TA for the Integrated Land and Population Development Program on
Kiritimati Island. The AsDB supports also efforts to improve the government's financial management
through TA for Economic Management and Public Sector Reform recognizing the sizeable constraint the
poor performance of public enterprises is placing on government ability to fund needed goods and
services.

STATISTICAL ISSUES
Assessment of Data Adequacy for Surveillance
(As of May 1, 2013)
General: Data provision has some shortcomings, but is broadly adequate for surveillance. Balance of Payments
data are the most affected area.
National Accounts: With PTFAC assistance GDP estimates have improved. Three TA missions took place in 2012 to
improve national account data and produce revised estimates through 2011. However, further capacity building
would be needed to continue to improve the quality of GDP estimates. So far, estimates are limited to Gross
Domestic Product (GDP) at current and constant 06 prices, using the production approach. Work is ongoing on the
expenditure-based GDP estimates.
Price statistics: The monthly retail price index (1996=100) is produced with a short lag (about a month), based on
a survey in South Tarawa (a national index is not available). There are no producer, wholesale, or trade price indices.
Government finance statistics: A Government Finance Statistics mission took place in January 2013 to compile
draft public sector delineation by completing work on the institutional unit classification. While a complete review
of government units, statutory extra budgetary units, and state-owned enterprises (SOE) was completed, a gap still
remains regarding donor-financed project funds.
Monetary statistics: The balance sheets of all the financial institutions (Bank of Kiribati, Development Bank of
Kiribati, Kiribati Provident Fund, and Kiribati Insurance Corporation) are available with lags, but the consolidated
balance sheet of the financial sector is not available. Data on interest rates are reported with a long lag.
Balance of payments: The quality of the data has improved with the PFTAC assistance. A PFTAC mission took
place in August 2012. The mission revised the BOP estimates up to2011, and updating estimates to end 2009. As in
the case of GDP data. PFTAC has suggested the need for further statistical capacity building. There still remain
some shortcomings in non-trade external statistics, which are reported with a long delay (about a year or more).

STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2013 ARTICLE IV
CONSULTATION—DEBT SUSTAINABILITY ANALYSIS1
Approved By
Hoe Ee Khor and Peter Allum
(IMF); Jeffrey Lewis and
Sudhir Shetty (World Bank)

Prepared by the Staff of the International Monetary Fund
and the World Bank

Kiribati continues to be at high risk of debt distress according to this update of the debt sustainability
analysis (DSA). Containing the risk of debt distress will require prudent financing by continuing to
secure grants to support the country’s large development needs, and implementing fiscal and structural
reform agenda that would ensure fiscal sustainability and raise long-term growth.

Background
Kiribati is a remote Pacific microstate. The export and production bases are narrow and limited to
copra, seaweed and fishing. The revenue base is very volatile, with fishing license fees making up
about 50 percent of government revenues. Kiribati’s sovereign wealth fund—Revenue Equalization
Reserve Fund (RERF) is a major source of financing and a cushion against risks. Climate change and
pressures on infrastructure raise additional challenges. The country relies heavily on foreign aid to
finance large development.
The fiscal position has deteriorated in recent years and the per capita value of Kiribati’s wealth
fund has declined substantially. Large overall fiscal deficits over the last decade (about 16 percent
of GDP on average) have resulted in substantial drawdowns of the RERF—the main source of deficit
financing.2 The RERF assets dropped to A$570 million or 340 percent of GDP in 2012 from
A$658 million or 565 percent of GDP in 2000.

1

The DSA has been produced in consultation with the Asian Development Bank (AsDB). This DSA is based on the
common standard LIC DSA framework. Under the Country Policy and Institutional Assessment (CPIA), Kiribati is rated
as a weak performer, and the DSA uses the indicative threshold indicators on the external public debt for countries in
this category: 30 percent for the present value (PV) of debt-to-GDP ratio; 100 percent for the PV of debt-to exports
ratio; 200 percent for the PV of debt-to-revenue ratio; 15 percent for the debt service-to-exports ratio; and 18 percent
for the debt service-to-revenue ratio.
2

The RERF is a wealth fund established in 1956 and was capitalized using phosphate mining proceeds before
phosphate deposits were exhausted in 1979.

KIRIBATI

As of end-2012, domestic debt accounted for 3⅔ percent of GDP, while gross external debt is
estimated at about 8 percent of GDP. Domestic debt includes the publicly guaranteed debt of the
state-owned enterprises (SOEs). As of end-2012, all external public debt consisted of concessional
loans.
The medium-term macroeconomic outlook points to moderate growth. The economy is
estimated to have grown by about 2.8 percent in 2012. Going forward, donor-financed road and
airport projects are expected to boost construction and support growth over the medium term.
Based on the government intentions under donor-supported reform program, fiscal deficit is
expected to narrow. Kiribati continues to be vulnerable to external shocks from volatile fishing
license revenues, and from financial exposure of its sovereign wealth fund and pension fund.

The Baseline Scenario
Under the baseline scenario, fiscal deficit is projected to improve in the medium and longer
term. (The macroeconomic assumptions underlying the baseline scenario are presented in Box 1.)
The overall fiscal deficit is projected to be about 10⅓ percent of GDP by 2030, down from around
21 percent in 2013. It is assumed that the deficit is partly financed by the assumed about US$7–
$10 million of external loans each year in the medium term, and about US$10 million each year in
the longer term to finance large infrastructure and other development needs, as well as to address
adverse impact of climate change. The remaining financing gap is met through drawdowns of the
RERF, without additional domestic borrowing. Annual drawdown from the RERF is projected to be
10⅓ of GDP on average in the medium term and 8⅔ percent of GDP on average during 2019–33. As
a result, the RERF real per capita balance continues to decline.
External Debt Sustainability Analysis
The external DSA indicates Kiribati is at high risk of debt distress, in line with the conclusion of
the previous DSA from the 2011 Article IV consultation. The PV of external debt will witness
a large increase due to loan disbursements. There is a sizable and protracted breach of the PV of
debt-to-exports ratio threshold and of the PV of the debt to GDP ratio around 2025. The PV of
external debt will increase from 8½ percent of GDP in 2013 to 30 percent of GDP in 2025, and reach
over 100 percent of exports starting from 2025.
Stress tests indicate that the country’s debt path is vulnerable to shocks to financing terms
and to exports. The present value (PV) of debt to export ratio and the PV of debt to GDP ratio
thresholds are breached under the extreme stress test scenario, including a scenario which assumes
the interest rate on new borrowing is 200 basis points higher than in the baseline.3

As a measure of sustainability, fishing license fees are included in export ratio.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

KIRIBATI

Box 1: Macroeconomic Assumptions Under the Baseline Scenario

GDP growth and population. The economy is expected to grow at 2.8 percent in 2012 and
about 2 percent in the medium term, driven by donor-financed projects, fishing license revenues and
remittances. Over the long term, growth will moderate to 1.8 percent. Population is projected to
grow at 1.7 percent per year.

Aid flows in form of grants are expected to be around 33½ percent of GDP over the medium
term and to decline to about 29 percent in the longer term, assuming that the government’s
implementation of reforms encourages continuing support from the main donors (AusAID, New
Zealand AID, Japan, and Taiwan Province of China). Access to the IDA-type grant, financing is
assumed to be US$10 million per year during 2013–15 to finance large infrastructure projects,
including road rehabilitation, airport improvement, and others.

New external loan disbursements are assumed to average about 3½ percent of GDP over the
medium and long term. Government is expected to access IDA-type financing of US$8 million in
2016, increasing to US$10 million annually from 2017. These loans and other investments will be
needed to support large development needs in infrastructure, health and education, as well as to
adapt to adverse impact in private change.

FDI flows experience a substantial increase in 2013 because of expected additional
investments in fishing joint venture. Thereafter they continue at positive level of about ½ percent of
GDP per year reflecting additional investment in fishing and marine sectors as a result of the reforms.

The overall fiscal deficit will be reduced gradually to around 14 percent of GDP by 2018, under
the government commitment to reforms. The RERF drawdowns would be reduced correspondingly.
Nevertheless, the RERF per capita value in real terms would not stabilize and will decline substantially
by 2033 compared to the level of 2011. (The nominal rate of annual return on RERF is assumed at
5⅓ percent in the long term.)

The current account deficit will narrow in the medium term, reflecting decrease in the fiscal
deficit. The trade deficit follows similar trend.

Public Debt Sustainability Analysis
Public debt analysis paints a similar picture. Under the baseline scenario, the PV of total public
debt is projected to increase to above 30 percent of GDP by 2023, driven mainly by external
borrowings. Public debt sustainability is vulnerable to shocks as well. Under the most extreme stress
test scenario—real GDP growth being one standard deviation, temporarily lower in the next two
years—the PV of debt reaches about 33 percent of GDP by 2023 and 58 percent of GDP by 2033.
The Stronger Reform Scenario
The stronger reform scenario envisages additional fiscal consolidation and improvements in
business prospects that would lead to eventual stabilization of the RERF and reduction of the
debt vulnerabilities. The RERF under this scenario stabilizes at a level of slightly below A$4000 and
the debt distress level could be reduced to low as a result of the improved macro-fiscal situation and
more favorable composition of financing.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

KIRIBATI

This scenario illustrates that such an outcome would not be easy to achieve as the underlying
assumptions demonstrate. The population growth and the nominal rate of annual return on RERF
are as under the baseline scenario. Reflecting the outcomes of reforms, the GDP growth is assumed
to be about 2.1–2.3 percent in the long term, compared to 1.8 percent under the baseline scenario.
The population growth and the nominal rate of annual return on RERF are as under the baseline
scenario. Fishing license revenues are also assumed to improve somewhat through better pricing
mechanisms.
This scenario shows that stabilizing RERF and achieving higher growth is a difficult task. Tax
revenue would be higher—21 percent on average in the long term due to improvement in tax
administration, compared to around 19 percent under the baseline. Fishing license revenues are also
assumed to improve somewhat through better pricing mechanisms. Current expenditure would also
need to be reduced from about 50 percent of GDP in 2018 to about 44 percent of GDP in 2030
through a combination of adjustment in wages and salaries, subsidies, and other current
expenditures. Stronger reforms and improving business prospects would be needed to ensure higher
grants, higher FDI, higher remittances due to expanded opportunities to work. In total, these flows
are more than 8 percent of GDP higher compared with the baseline scenario, offsetting the impact of
fiscal consolidation..
A greater proportion of Kiribati’s development financing needs is projected to be met by
grants rather than loans. Over the long term, external grants are assumed to be about 35 percent
of GDP each year compared to 30 percent in the baseline scenario. The external loan financing is
envisaged to be about US$2½ million each year compared to US$10 million in the baseline scenario.
There would be no new domestic borrowing after 2013.
Under the stronger scenario, the PV of total public debt is projected to increase to around
11 percent of GDP over the long term, much lower than 34 percent of GDP in the baseline
scenario. The PV of both external debt-to-GDP and external debt-to-export will stay far below the
threshold. The PV of external debt-to-GDP ratio will eventually decline after reaching its peak at
16⅔ percent in 2019, while the PV of external debt-to-export will start declining after reaching to
53⅔ percent in 2019. Even with most extreme shocks, the PV of external debt-to-GDP will not cross
the threshold, while the PV of external debt-to-export will cross the threshold for a period starting
2015, but eventually decline below the threshold in the longer term.

Conclusions
Kiribati continues to be at high risk of debt distress. To narrow fiscal imbalances and stabilize the
real per capita RERF value in the longer term, it is imperative for the authorities to pursue fiscal
consolidation through both revenue and expenditure measures. Structural reforms to improve
business climate and promoting private sector growth are also critical to reduce fiscal burden.
The authorities broadly agreed with this assessment. They indicated the commitment to
preserving value of the RERF through fiscal and structural reform program supported by donor
community. The government plans to introduce value added and excise taxes and is keen to improve
tax administration. They are also committed to controlling expenditure by reforming SOEs and
rationalizing the administrative costs and public wages.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

700 19th Street, NW
Washington, D. C. 20431 USA

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2013 Article IV Consultation with Kiribati
On May 29, 2013, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded the
Article IV consultation with Kiribati.1
Background
Kiribati’s key policy challenges include reducing structural fiscal imbalances and increasing
medium-term growth potential. Growth in 2012 reached 2.8 percent, reflecting implementation
of donor projects, higher than average fishing license fees, and remittances. Airport and seaport
projects in particular boosted construction activities. Nevertheless, inflation remained negative
on account of lower prices of rice and some other staples. The revenue from fishing licenses
was much higher than average in 2012, and is expected to decline in the period ahead.
The current account deficit widened slightly in 2012 to 31 percent of GDP mostly because of an
increase in imports of equipment associated with infrastructure projects, which was partially
offset by high fishing license fees. Remittances, which are dominated by transfers from seamen,
declined somewhat, due to the slowdown in the global shipping activity.
Fiscal imbalances remain large. The 2013 budget implies a current fiscal deficit at about
18 percent of GDP, assuming conservative projections for fishing license revenue. 2 High fiscal
1

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On
return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the
Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the
Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the
country's authorities. An explanation of any qualifiers used in summings up can be found here:
http://www.imf.org/external/np/sec/misc/qualifiers.htm.
2

The current fiscal deficit excludes development expenditures financed by donors and
corresponding development grants on the revenue side. It is a better indicator of the fiscal stance
and financing demands on Kiribati government than the overall deficit.

deficits resulted in large financing demands on its sovereign wealth fund (Revenue Equalization
Reserve Fund, or RERF). In 2012, the RERF balance stood at 3½ times GDP, down from 5¾
times GDP in 2000. In constant per capita terms, the RERF assets were almost half of its
amount in 2000.
The government has embarked on a broad range of reforms supported by development
partners to address its fiscal and structural challenges. In 2012, the government cleared most of
the overdraft facilities following the IMF advice and technical assistance, thereby reducing its
interest cost. Ongoing reforms cover various areas: public financial management, tax system,
State-Owned Enterprises (SOEs), and the private sector. Recently, the parliament passed an
SOE bill establishing a strengthened legal framework for governance, financial reporting, and
management of SOEs.
Although formal financial intermediation and access to credit for the private sector remains
limited, there was an increase in credit to households from banking institutions in 2011–12. In
addition, a small lending scheme introduced by the Kiribati Provident Fund contributed to private
sector lending. Although the loans are mostly collateralized, the non-performing loan ratios at
the Development Bank of Kiribati remained high.
Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors viewed Kiribati’s key policy challenges as reducing structural fiscal
imbalances and increasing medium-term growth potential. Directors concluded that the
successful implementation of reforms will improve Kiribati’s growth prospects, promote private
sector development, enhance fiscal sustainability, and strengthen resilience to external shocks.
Directors underscored that a key policy objective is to reduce structural fiscal imbalances and
ensure the long term sustainability of the Revenue Equalization Reserve Fund (RERF). They
agreed that restoring fiscal sustainability by stabilizing the value of the RERF in real per capita
terms is a challenging task that requires significant fiscal effort across a broad front. Directors
stressed in particular the need for comprehensive tax reforms, improved tax compliance, and
decisive steps to strengthen public financial management. In this context, they welcomed the
authorities’ intention to adopt the value added tax, and stressed that achieving sufficient growth
of fishing license fees is important for revenue prospects. On the expenditure side, Directors
suggested that curbing the growth of current expenditure, including the public wage bill, will be
important to accommodate the need for social spending and infrastructure development, as well
as to address challenges from climate change. Directors also noted that improving the efficiency
of subsidies will enhance incentives and reduce risks to the budget.
Directors noted that sound public financial management is essential to ensure a sustainable
fiscal framework. They commended the authorities for ongoing efforts to strengthen revenue
and expenditure projections, and encouraged them to adopt a prudent debt management policy.
Directors welcomed the close collaboration with the donor community and encouraged the
authorities to avoid nonconcessional borrowing.

Directors welcomed the government’s progress in state-owned enterprise (SOE) reform, noting
that these reforms have already resulted in a decrease in budget costs, and encouraged the
authorities to continue addressing performance issues in the Public Utilities Board and other
SOEs.
Expanding the role of the private sector in the economy is critical for increasing growth and
employment, and reducing fiscal imbalances. Directors saw the local marine sector as having
great potential to broaden employment opportunities, create value added, and increase tax
revenue. In this context, Directors encouraged the authorities to adopt the National Fisheries
Policy that is currently being developed. Other sectors also hold promise, in particular
increasing tourism and overseas employment. Improving the business climate is also necessary
to help the private sector grow.
While noting the importance of access to financing for private projects, Directors emphasized
the need to maintain high prudential standards in financial institutions. In this context, they
underscored the importance of reducing the high non-performing loan ratios in the Development
Bank of Kiribati and strengthening the financial position of the Kiribati Provident Fund (KPF).
Directors also encouraged the authorities to continue improving the quality of economic and
financial statistics.

Statement by Jong-Won Yoon, Executive Director for Kiribati, and Graig Fookes,
Advisor to the Executive Director of Kiribati
May 29, 2013

We thank staff for their report and close engagement with the authorities. The IMF has placed the
country under intensive surveillance and has worked closely, alongside other donor partners, to
provide considerable international support. We thank the IMF for the policy advice and technical
assistance provided by the many teams that have visited over the last 24 months.
Economic Context
The islands of Kiribati illustrate the challenges of governance in a remote highly open country
dispersed over a large geographic area. Kiribati is a large ocean state consisting of 33 small islands
spread over roughly 3.5 million square kilometers of ocean. 70 percent of the 103,000 residents are
located on the island of South Tarawa following a gradual migration towards formal employment
opportunities. The remaining members of population are spread across the nineteen other
inhabitable islands. These islands can be upwards of several thousand kilometers apart. The tension
between growing population pressures on South Tarawa verses the economic benefits of
agglomeration define Kiribati’s internal economic policy. Development opportunities on many of the
outer islands remain limited, but the island of South Tarawa may be approaching its carrying capacity
without significant investment in infrastructure.
Most of South Tarawa is less than three meters above sea level, which suggests the country remains
exposed to increased weather volatility from climate change or tsunamis. An increase in sea levels
may present a potential existential threat over the next hundred years, although recent research
highlights that reef islands, such as Kiribati, may undergo a dynamic response as a result of the
constant erosion and accumulation of sand (accretion).
Economic Outlook
Economic growth will strengthen as several major donor funded projects get underway over the next
few years. The airport will be resurfaced, the seaport enlarged, and South Tarawa’s only road will be
resealed. The actual lasting impact on the domestic economy may remain modest as all materials,
specialist machinery, and most of the construction staff will need to be sourced from abroad. GDP
growth will strengthen to around 2.8 percent and inflation will become positive rising to 2.5 percent
in 2012. Fishing revenues strengthened over 2012, but are expected to remain volatile as the number
of day licenses sold depends on migratory tuna stocks, which remain sensitive to climatic conditions
and changes in water temperature.
Fiscal Policy
General spending pressures and the decline in fishing revenue through 2011 widened the structural
government budget deficit. Tax revenues have fallen alongside an increase in non-compliance. The
authorities agree that action will be required to stabilize the budget given the current fiscal balance
is forecast to reach 18.2 percent of GDP in the 2013.
Kiribati has significant financial assets amounting to around 340 percent of GDP held in a sovereign
wealth fund called the Revenue Equalization Reserve Fund (RERF). These funds were accumulated

2
from phosphate mining at the time of independence in 1971. Current projections suggest the RERF
will undergo a gradual depletion without policy change over the next couple of decades. The
authorities aim to retain the financial flexibility to handle the uncertainty around the effects of
climate change. Thus, Kiribati’s overriding fiscal goal remains to protect the value of the RERF. The
staff projections suggest an adjustment in the current deficit of 15 percent will be required to
stabilize the RERF over a period of 8-9 years. Our authorities remain committed to prudent
macroeconomic policies, but achieving this target could remain difficult. There are limited policy
tools to stabilize the economy as government budget contracts and the country continues to face
significant infrastructure needs. Our authorities are working on a new macro framework with IMF
assistance.
The World Bank and Aus Aid have offered to provide budget support to ease adjustment. Ongoing
support remains contingent on future policy action. Donor partners, including the IMF, have agreed a
policy reform matrix that identifies key reforms. These reforms have been carefully prioritized to
reflect the capacity constraints on the Kiribati Government and will be supported through the
provision of extensive technical assistance from a range of sources. Tax reform that includes steps to
improve compliance has been highlighted as immediate priorities for reform over the coming two
years. Financial reforms, SOE reform, and improved guidance around management of the RERF will
also occur. Subsidy reforms are under consideration as the copra purchasing scheme, which provides
an important safety net for subsistence populations on the outer islands remains expensive. Our
authorities emphasized the vulnerability of populations living on the outer islands and the
importance of providing opportunities to slow the flow of migration towards South Tarawa, where
the population pressures are most acute. The World Bank has agreed that some sort of transfer
system will ultimately be required and are investigating whether subsidies could be provided
through a better targeted scheme to lower the cost of the current social safety net. To prevent a
further buildup of loans, technical assistance has been requested to provide advice on centralized
debt management guidelines to establish policy criteria around any additional borrowing.
Departments and SOEs will face new limitations on their ability to independently incur debt or invoke
government guarantees through a requirement for formal Cabinet approval.
State Owned Enterprise Reform
Kiribati’s SOEs were originally set up to provide basic services, but as the private sector develops,
there may be options to reexamine the line between public and private provision. Several SOEs have
been privatized, although a range of structural factors complicate increased private sector
engagement. The import trading company was sold and tenders are open for the sale of the state
owned hotel. The Government is examining other asset sales and has submitted a Bill opening the
telecommunications industry to competition. The incumbent SOE in the sector is being
commercialized. Other SOEs with a social mandate will be more difficult to privatize. These entities
provide essential services and are often unlikely to prove commercially viable. For example, internal
shipping services remain essential to provide food and basic supplies to the population on the outer
islands. It remains questionable as to whether the private sector could operate a commercially viable
shipping service to the outer islands that have populations of less than a thousand people and can
be up to several thousand kilometers away.
Financial surprises and a lack of profitability can be traced back to three main factors involving:
mixed social and commercial objectives; an inability to gain economies of scale; and a lack of
management expertise. Our authorities are working with the ADB on a comprehensive review of the

3
SOEs aimed at improving financial transparency through improved management or sale. An SOE Bill
has been passed this April establishing a strengthened legal framework covering independence,
governance, financial reporting, and the management of SOEs. Arrears on inter-SOE debt and loans
to the commercial bank are being catalogued and are expected to be cleared, including those
between the Public Utilities Board and Kiribati Oil. The Ministry of Finance is also increasing its
supervision and oversight to gain an early warning of potential financial distress.
Private Sector Growth
Growth in the private sector will be important to reduce the social cost of fiscal adjustment given
high unemployment and relatively low annual income. The rapid population growth in South Tarawa
has created a growing private sector, although most businesses remain small, informal, and largely
family run. Improved urban planning given rising population density and clarity around lack of
formal land title could encourage investment. Our Kiribati authorities are finalizing a National Private
Sector Development Strategy to examine ways to address these issues.
The authorities have worked for many years to encourage local participation in the fishing industry –
the nation’s primary economic resource. A range of joint ventures, employment agreements have
been trialed in an attempt to overcome a chronic lack of capital. The Government hopes to complete
a National Fishing Strategy in 2014 to encourage development through, among other things,
improvements to the process of approval and management of joint ventures. Kiribati has received
international direct investment in a new fish processing plant, which offers a promising opportunity
for Kiribati to earn more from its fishery resource. The factory will provide employment and exposure
to international management practice. The authorities are in negotiations with Fiji to open the air
route to competition. In the mean time, fish can be shipped frozen once a month by boat, although
frozen fish sell for less global markets.
Labor mobility and foreign policy
Given high underemployment or unemployment, Kiribati sees global integration as its primary
avenue towards economic development and the Government has placed a large emphasis on
providing the population with the education and skills necessary to capitalize on employment
opportunities abroad. Kiribati has sent seafarers abroad for nearly fifty years and will be encouraging
international contractors to take on and train local workers. The local technical institute has
supported this trend through work to align training schemes with Australian educational standards.
This should allow local tradesmen to migrate to meet skill shortages in Australia. New Zealand and
Australia also attract seasonal workers from around the Pacific, which will add to remittance flows.
Shocks to growth increasingly come from abroad and many of Kiribati’s key challenges, including
those associated with fisheries or climate change, increasingly rely on international cooperation.
President Tong has become a global advocate for action against climate change and Kiribati remains
a party to the Nauru fishing agreement. The experience in the fishing industry is illustrative of the
need small nations have for more regional and international cooperation. The Nauru Agreement’s
floor on the sale of day fishing licenses remains an important regional initiative as small Pacific states
have historically struggled to negotiate on an individual basis. The floor has remained fairly binding
as vessel owners arbitrage given they can easily choose to fish in neighboring waters. The minimum
price set by the Parities to the Nauru Agreement will increase by 20 percent in 2014.
