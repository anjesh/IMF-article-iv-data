CHILE
Staff Report for the 2008 Article IV Consultation
Prepared by the Western Hemisphere Department
(In consultation with other departments)
Approved by Markus Rodlauer and Adnan Mazarei
June 18, 2008
•

Context. Chile has been in many respects a model for successful macroeconomic management
among emerging market economies. The authorities and staff share a long-standing consensus on
the rules-based policy framework, including a floating exchange rate, that has alleviated the
impact of recent shocks.

•

Recent developments have been dominated by global food and oil price shocks, exacerbated by
domestic drought. Annual inflation was close to 9 percent in May, but is expected to decline
gradually in the second half of the year. Growth is likely to remain below trend through 2009.
Chile has so far proved resilient to global market turmoil, but risks from a sharp global downturn,
higher energy prices, and tightening of credit conditions for emerging markets remain.

•

Key policy recommendations:
¾ Policy framework and stance. Monetary policy has been appropriately tightened, and the
central bank should stand ready to raise interest rate further, if necessary, to keep inflation
expectations anchored firmly to the 3-percent target. The structural fiscal surplus rule is as
important as ever in shielding the economy from shocks, and room existing under the rule is
being used to alleviate the impact of higher inflation on vulnerable population groups.
¾ Sovereign Wealth Funds. Developing a long-term investment objective for Chile’s
stabilization fund would be useful, and benefit from an evaluation of overall copper wealth.
Reinvesting the cyclical part of the funds’ returns could reduce volatility in budget revenues.
¾ Capital markets. Efforts to boost the development of Chile’s capital markets could focus on
lowering regulatory and tax barriers for foreign investors and consolidating public debt
issuance into fewer benchmark issues. A Financial Sector Assessment Program Update could
help identify vulnerabilities.

•

Authorities’ views. There was consensus on the long-term advantages of preserving the current
rules-based policy framework. The authorities felt that the framework was sufficiently flexible to
deal with a severe global slowdown.

•

Mission. A staff team comprising M. Mühleisen (Head), N. Batini, J. Walsh (all WHD), Z. Arvai
(MCM), and A. Matsumoto (RES) visited Santiago during May 19-30, 2008. Mr. Rodlauer
(WHD) participated in the final discussions with Governor De Gregorio and Finance Minister
Velasco. Mr. Rojas (OED) also attended the meetings.

I. RECENT GLOBAL SHOCKS, OUTLOOK, AND RISKS

2006

2007

2008

5
1.
Chile’s adherence to a prudent, rules-based macroeconomic policy framework has
delivered important economic and social rewards.1 Responsible economic policies, trade
openness, and institutional reforms have helped foster growth and price stability. Real per
capita incomes have increased by 3 percent on average over the past 12 years, the poverty
rate has been more than halved over the same period, the public sector has become a net
creditor, and Chile has begun membership discussions with the OECD.
2.
This policy framework has helped Chile preserve economic stability through the
ongoing copper boom. Steady fiscal policy, following the structural surplus rule, has largely
de-linked the economy from rising copper prices as most domestic mining revenues are
accumulated abroad. This has prevented overheating, mitigated upward pressure on the
currency, and led to the accumulation of a combined 15 percent of GDP worth of foreign
assets in two sovereign wealth funds (SWFs).
3.
More recently, the economy has been hit by a confluence of large domestic and
external shocks that has proved more difficult to absorb (Box 1). Chile provides no general
subsidies on food and energy, whose domestic prices have increased sharply with global
price spikes. At the same time, a severe drought raised prices for local food produce and
affected the production of hydroelectricity. With natural gas imports from Argentina
diminishing, electricity producers have shifted to diesel fuel at a high marginal cost. As these
are also being passed on, inflation has increased to close to 9 percent in May, well beyond
the central bank’s 3-percent target.2
4.
The impact of these shocks has affected growth, and a global scenario of lower
growth and higher energy prices poses further risks to the outlook.3 Much of the slowdown
since mid-2007 is due to a drop in value-added in the electricity sector, but demand growth is
also expected to slow, given past interest rate increases, tighter credit conditions, and a drop
in consumer confidence despite higher fiscal transfers. However, investment has benefited
from lower prices for imported capital goods and a recent rise in FDI, helping growth to stay
above 4 percent in 2008. Given Chile’s diversified geographical trade structure, the impact of
a U.S. recession would likely be moderate, but the risk of a broader global slowdown (Box 2)
and the difficult energy situation continue to weigh on the outlook.
5.
Emergency steps have succeeded in avoiding electricity rationing, but limited
energy supply will remain a challenge through 2009. The government extended daylight

The tight energy situation is estimated to have reduced growth by about 1 percentage point.

saving time and reduced network voltage by 10 percent, which—together with recent
rainfall—has secured electricity supply. However, the cost of electricity generation remains
at a record high, and relief is only expected from new power generation plants and an LNG
import terminal becoming operational in late 2009.
6.
Long-term inflation expectations remain anchored by the monetary framework,
with inflation projected to return to target toward the end of the 24-month horizon. Staff
and authorities expect inflation to fall in the second half of 2008, helped by past monetary
tightening, recent rainfall, and base effects, and then to decline gradually toward the
3-percent target by mid-2010. Despite a 50 basis point interest rate increase in June, risks
remain on the upside, given the upward momentum in oil prices, a weaker peso, rising shortterm inflation expectations, and still high core inflation. Nominal wages have kept pace with
inflation, partly due to indexation, but unit labor cost increases have remained moderate—
consistent with staff estimates that output remains currently below potential.4
7.
Throughout the global financial turmoil, domestic financial markets have
continued to function normally. Given Chilean banks’ low exposure to subprime mortgages,
overnight spreads have risen only modestly since last fall. A recent survey confirms that most
banks have tightened lending standards, although bank balance sheets remain strong amid
ample funding sources. Should credit conditions in developed markets deteriorate further,
however, the strong presence of foreign bank subsidiaries could pose a spillover risk (Box 3).

Staff estimates that energy supply problems have temporarily lowered potential output growth to around
½ percentage point below its 5-percent trend.

Chile’s fiscal position remains exceptionally strong. The government registered a
record surplus of 8¾ percent of GDP in 2007, owing to both record-high copper prices and
domestic tax revenue growth. With the reduction of the 2008 structural surplus target to
½ percent of GDP, real expenditure has been budgeted to grow by 9 percent. The 2008 fiscal
surplus is likely to again reach close to 8 percent of GDP.
9.
After a major pension reform passed Congress in January 2008, political support
for new reform projects may be more difficult to obtain. The government lost its majority in
both houses of Congress, although its poll standings have improved in recent months. A
report by a Presidential commission on labor and social equity provides a roadmap for further
discussions; key reforms will have to find a broad national consensus in order to be
implemented. Municipal elections are scheduled for October, and presidential elections for
late next year.

11.
Notwithstanding the stronger peso, export growth has remained relatively robust.
Exports to the United States have slowed, but overall growth in non-copper export volumes
has remained positive. Chile maintained its global export market share in 2007, and increased
its share of the Asian market by about 80 percent over the past 5 years. However, the current
account surplus is expected to fall into deficit in 2008, partly as a result of continued strong
import growth, including of capital goods.5
12.
Chile’s external position is expected to remain stable, and policies are geared
toward further reducing external vulnerabilities. The trade balance is projected to fall into
deficit over the medium term as growth recovers and the price of copper declines in line with
medium-term price assumptions. With a corresponding decline in profit remittances by
mining companies, the current account is projected to adjust gradually to its underlying
medium-term deficit of around 2½ percent of GDP—close to the CGER norm of about
3 percent of GDP. Staff expects such a deficit to be easily financed, including as a result of
forthcoming capital market reforms, and continued adherence to the macroeconomic
framework should help contain exchange rate volatility.
13.
The widening of the current account deficit would be largely offset by a decline in
portfolio outflows corresponding to lower government asset accumulation abroad. A drop
in copper revenues would diminish both the fiscal surplus and the amount of foreign assets
acquired by the government, with private capital inflows expected to pick up only gradually
on a net basis. Unlike in other emerging markets, there have been few signs of speculative
portfolio flows into Chile so far, in part because domestic assets are still regarded as being

to grow by 3½ percent during 2009 and beyond.

relatively expensive. Moreover, the liberalization of foreign investment limits for pension
funds will likely lead to some outbound portfolio flows over the medium term.
14.
The central bank decided in April to raise international reserves by US$8 billion
(5 percent of GDP) by year’s end.6 The authorities explained that the reserves buildup was
designed to provide a cushion against a broader deterioration of financing conditions for
emerging market economies, and with the peso appreciating rapidly and being above its longterm equilibrium, it was the right time to intervene and shore up reserves at a relatively low
cost. The intervention is being implemented in a transparent, pre-announced manner (US$50
million a day), preserving the floating exchange rate regime and the flexibility of monetary
policy to react to changes in the inflation outlook. The foreign exchange purchases are being
sterilized at an estimated 10-year cost of ¾ percent of GDP.
15.
The increase in foreign exchange reserves is consistent with most optimal reserve
estimates for Chile.7 Reserves are projected to reach about 15 percent of GDP by end-2008,
equivalent to about 90 percent of imports plus short-term debt. The authorities explained that
assets in the government’s Fund for Economic and Social Stabilization (FESS) were not fully
comparable to reserves, in part because they had the different objective of stabilizing fiscal
expenditure over time.
III. POLICY DISCUSSIONS
The policy discussions focused on three issues:
•

Managing supply shocks. What is the optimal policy response to supply shocks
within the rules-based framework?

•

SWFs and Macroeconomic Policy. What are the implications of SWF buildup for
economic policy, and how should SWFs be managed?

•

Capital market development. With pension funds free to invest more funds abroad,
what measures are needed to increase depth and competition in financial markets?
A. Managing Supply Shocks in a Rules-Based Policy Framework

16.
The combination of inflation targeting, a floating exchange rate, and rules-based
fiscal policies remains the optimal policy framework for Chile.8 The authorities and staff

Separately, the government announced in May that it would purchase US$800 million (½ percent of GDP) in
foreign exchange to transfer to the central bank as the third tranche under its five-year recapitalization schedule.

Chapter 3 of the Selected Issues paper confirms the framework’s welfare-maximizing properties. Chapter 4
highlights the stabilizing impact of inflation targeting in response to global liquidity shocks.

11
agreed that the framework had helped the economy adjust well to recent shocks, and
provided for sufficient flexibility in case of more adverse inflation or output developments.
Monetary and Exchange Rate Policy
17.
The Banco Central de Chile (BCC) remains focused on returning inflation to target
over the 24-month policy horizon. Having raised interest rates by 125 basis points between
August 2007 and February 2008, the BCC adopted a neutral policy bias in April. However,
monthly inflation has since been accelerating, most core inflation measures remain outside
the bank’s tolerance range, and world oil prices have again turned sharply upward. In
response, the bank raised interest rates by an additional 50 basis points on June 10.
18.
Monetary policy will need to react to any further manifestation of upside risks to
the inflation outlook. Inflation remains largely driven by global commodity prices, and the
BCC’s latest policy action underscores its commitment to meeting the inflation target.
Nevertheless, given the strong inflation increase in May and recent jump in oil prices, the
authorities and staff agreed that the decline in inflation over the coming months could be
more gradual than anticipated in the last Monetary Policy Report, possibly raising the risks of
second-round effects.9 In this light, the central bank should stand ready with additional policy
measures, if necessary, to keep inflation expectations anchored firmly to the 3-percent target.
19.
The central bank earns high marks for transparency, although communication of
the inflation outlook could be improved. Given the unusual complexity related to different
supply shocks, market participants have had some difficulties disentangling first and secondround price effects, and assessing the various risks to the outlook. Providing additional
information on the BCC’s inflation forecast in the Monetary Policy Report, including on the
propagation of shocks and monetary policy lags, could further strengthen the effectiveness of
the central bank’s policies.
Fiscal Policy
20.
Fiscal policy has helped mitigate the social impact of inflation. The reduction in the
surplus target to ½ percent of GDP this year has provided a moderate stimulus to economic
activity. This was mainly used to boost spending on education, but a pickup in nominal
revenues has since provided room for ½ percent of GDP in additional spending. The
government has provided targeted assistance to workers in certain export sectors, and
legislation is pending to provide one-off cash transfers of $45 to the poorest 40 percent of the
population and an additional $42 to low-income pensioners.

The recent increase in both market and survey-based inflation expectations may partly reflect the lagged
impact of past inflation (see Chapter 1 of the Selected Issues paper)

21.
While observing the surplus rule, the government has also used fiscal means to
help the economy adjust to the rise in fuel prices. A two-year 25-percent reduction in the
excise tax on gasoline and a $200 million (0.1 percent of GDP) injection into the fuel
stabilization fund have temporarily reduced the retail price of gasoline by 10 percent since
the beginning of the year. The fund has also absorbed some of the high costs of substituting
diesel for gas and hydro-energy as the marginal source for electricity generation. This has
smoothed the impact of recent oil price shocks and helped contain headline inflation. A
further $1 billion injection was announced on June 2, after the end of the mission.10
22.
Looking forward, fiscal expenditure will continue to grow in line with the surplus
rule, consistent with macroeconomic stability. The government has been successful in
communicating that growth of public spending beyond the limit implied by the rule risks
putting renewed upward pressure on the exchange rate. The authorities emphasized that the
focus of fiscal policy will be on quality and efficient implementation of spending programs.
What if the global economy turns worse?
23.
Government officials were confident that economic stability could be maintained
under worse global financial conditions. They emphasized that central bank reserves and
the FESS provided ample room to respond in case of a financial sector crisis or an abrupt
decline of government revenues, respectively. In particular, the fiscal rule had been designed
to stabilize public investment and social spending in case of volatile copper revenues. The
government, central bank, and financial supervisors meet regularly on financial stability
issues, and the authorities have been in close contact with foreign supervisors to follow
developments of common interest.
24.
The staff suggested that stepping up the recapitalization of the central bank could
bolster its capacity to react in a crisis. The central bank is currently undercapitalized by
2½ percent of GDP, and the cost of sterilizing foreign exchange purchases is likely to delay
the bank’s return to a positive net worth. The authorities responded that they were committed
to the five-year plan approved by Congress (½ percent of GDP a year, two years remaining),
after which the need for additional transfers could be reviewed by future administrations.
B. Sovereign Wealth Funds and Macroeconomic Policy
25.
Sustained high copper prices have led to rapid asset accumulation in Chile’s two
SWFs. By end-2008, the FESS will likely contain $21 billion in assets (13 percent of GDP),
and another 1½ percent of GDP are held in the Pension Reserve Fund (PRF). The central

10

Staff estimates that, on current oil price projections, US$500 million (0.3 percent of GDP) in subsidies would
be spent in 2008. Gasoline nevertheless remains expensive, largely due to high taxation by emerging market
standards, and pass-through of global price changes has been the highest in the Western Hemisphere. The fund
is set up in such way that retail prices fully adjust to world market parity over a period of 12 months.

bank has managed both funds since their inception, following best-practice guidelines for
reserves management.
26.
The government is developing policies for managing the SWFs with a longer time
horizon. The bulk of SWF assets will be kept in highly-rated fixed-income securities, but a
more diversified portfolio will also include instruments with variable and longer duration. All
investments remain limited to marketable instruments, managed subject to high professional
standards and full transparency.
27.
The authorities have been working with other member countries and Fund staff on
developing best practices for SWFs. Fund technical assistance has focused on the strategic
asset allocation for both funds, taking into account their assumed asset and liability
structures. Significant progress has been made on the risk management framework, while the
authorities agreed that performance measurement and risk management infrastructure still
need to be improved.
28.
The SWFs will provide additional resources for public spending over the mediumterm. Eventually, the FRP will contribute about one quarter of the costs of the new pension
system. FESS income from asset returns—considered structural revenue under the surplus
rule—is projected to rise from ¾ percent of GDP to close to 1½ percent of GDP over the next
few years, including as a result of the proposed shift in the portfolio structure. The President
announced in May that $6 billion are to be transferred from the FESS to a new Bicentennial
Fund, with the revenue used to finance scholarships to study abroad for up to 30,000 students
in the next 10 years.11
29.
The staff recommended including only the funds’ structural asset income in the
structural revenue calculations for the budget. As the assets and their yield grow, the
cyclicality of asset returns—especially from exchange rate fluctuations—could lead to
unwanted volatility in the size of the annual budget. The authorities noted that, in practice, a
similar result was currently achieved by using stable and relatively standard assumptions in
projecting the funds’ income in the annual budget exercise.
30.
The staff also suggested that the FESS’ investment objectives be embedded in a
long-term fiscal framework. A comprehensive analysis of the structure of long-term public
assets and liabilities could inform a decision whether the FESS should primarily be a
stabilization or a saving fund. In this context, it would be helpful to assess the size of Chile’s
mineral deposits, for which no official estimates are available.
C. Capital Market Development
31.
The ongoing liberalization of foreign investment limits for pension funds has
provided an impetus for further financial sector reform. Chile’s corporate debt, equity, and
11

See Chapter 5 of the Selected Issues paper.

16
foreign exchange markets are well developed compared to most emerging market peers.
However, markets have been dominated by pension funds and other large buy-and-hold
investors, and there has been little participation of foreign investors. With pension funds
being allowed to invest up to 80 percent of their portfolios abroad by October 2009 (up from
30 percent until last year), the government has been planning to make domestic markets more
attractive for foreign investors.
32.
The authorities remain committed to promoting the participation of foreign
investors in domestic markets. The government is reviewing options to reduce registration
and tax requirements for foreign investors in order to foster financial market integration.
Staff noted that permitting the use of the peso in settling capital account transactions with
nonresidents would be key for developing Chile’s small derivatives markets.
33.
A new package of financial reforms aims to boost the internationalization of the
peso, increase market depth, and enhance market access for SMEs. This package would
include measures to encourage non-residents to issue peso-denominated debt in Chile, further
facilitate derivatives trading, and provide a framework for the securitization of SME loans. A
separate bill to establish a central counterparty for clearing and settlement purposes is already
pending in Congress. The authorities expect the measures to be implemented during 2009.
34.
The staff emphasized the importance of strengthening public debt management,
including by consolidating sovereign paper into fewer benchmark issues.12 The authorities
have made progress in developing benchmark issues, and the central bank and government
are coordinating closely on debt management. Staff cautioned that debt issuance was still
relatively fragmented, reflecting the varied objectives of maintaining both a nominal and
inflation-indexed yield curve and providing long-duration assets for institutional investors.13
35.
Supervisors were confident of the financial system’s capacity to withstand financial
turbulence. Banks had appropriately tightened lending standards, capital adequacy remained
strong, and bank supervisors remained in close contact with foreign counterparts to monitor
cross-border activities. They have stepped up the monitoring of banks’ asset quality,
liquidity, and risk management, and are working toward strengthening the bank resolution
framework. The authorities agreed that the scope for further market reforms and implications
for financial sector stability could usefully be discussed in the context of an FSAP Update,
and that market integrity could be enhanced further by providing supervisory and regulatory
bodies with operational and budgetary independence.

Chile’s fiscal surplus owes to dollar-denominated mining revenues that are kept in the FESS, with domestic

D. Other Structural Issues
36.
The government’s pension reform has been approved by Congress (see Country
Report No. 07/333). The reform passed broadly unchanged, with a net cost of about one
percent of GDP per year.
37.
An ambitious public sector reform agenda is moving forward. The agenda includes
plans to strengthen expenditure management and reform public procurement. Staff has
encouraged the authorities to move toward a formal medium-term expenditure framework
(MTEF) which would help to further improve treasury management and expenditure control,
and to complete passage of a public transparency bill.
38.
The authorities have initiated legislation to modernize the governance of public
enterprises in line with the OECD’s Public Enterprise Code. The bill brings most public
enterprises under the umbrella of the securities regulator, subjecting them to private sector
accounting and transparency standards. At the same time, legislation is being introduced to
strengthen corporate governance of private enterprises, including by mandating the presence
of independent board members.
39.
A high-level commission report provides a roadmap for labor and social reform.
The commission, established by President Bachelet in 2007, proposed the introduction of a
subsidy for low-income workers, in many respects similar to the principles of a negative
income tax. This proposal, as well as a suggested reform of the unemployment insurance
system, appear to enjoy a relatively broad political consensus. In other areas covered by the
commission, such as labor relations and collective bargaining, the report provides a useful
basis for further discussion.14
IV. STAFF APPRAISAL
40.
Chile’s adherence to a prudent, rules-based macroeconomic policy framework has
delivered important social and economic rewards. Chile has rightly set its sights on
eliminating poverty and closing the income gap with industrialized economies. The policy
framework has been instrumental for managing the copper boom in recent years, and helped
mitigate the impact of severe supply shocks experienced over the past 12 months.
41.
Despite the moderate slowdown of growth, inflation risks continue to pose a
challenge. Reflecting recent shocks, output growth is projected at about 4¼ percent in 2008,
and then to recover in 2009 toward potential. While inflation is projected to decline in the
second half of the year, the upward momentum in global oil prices suggests that supply
shocks could prove longer-lasting, and risks have shifted to the upside.

14

Simonovska and Söderling (WP/08/61) identified labor market rigidities as a key determinant in the decline
in trend growth in recent years.

poverty and social vulnerability.
· Establish a body responsible for the monitoring of the consistency of social policies and in charge of
performance evaluation

Workers

· Provide enhanced access to vocational training.
· Reinforce programs to level adult education and strengthen development plans to train the most
vulnerable fraction of the population.
· Introduce measures to improve severance pay system.
· Replace unemployment system based on individual accounts with a general fund.
· Provide pecuniary incentives to private and public job agencies to match workers from vulnerable social
strata with employers.

Women and Labor
Market

Foster the development of goods fairs to launch and market goods produced by SMEs.
Refocus existing microfinance instruments like the subsidy to transaction costs.
Advance development of credit scoring system.
Develop a simplified financial statement requirement to account for constrains on SMEs' human capital.
Accelerate adoption of Basel II capital requirements that reduce capital requirements for SME loans.
Accelerate reform of the notary system to speed up the reform of the guarantors system.

The group was commissioned to suggest policies to foster a more efficient labor market and reduce income inequality.

42.
Monetary policy has been appropriately geared toward meeting the 3-percent target
over the 2-year policy horizon. Although real wage increases remain moderate, near-term
inflation expectations have risen and core inflation measures are outside the bank’s tolerance
range. The central bank’s recent increase in interest rates has underscored its commitment to
minimize second-round inflation effects, and it should stand ready to tighten monetary policy
further, if necessary, to keep inflation expectations firmly anchored to the target.
43.
While the peso is estimated to be moderately overvalued, domestic policies remain
consistent with external stability. The central bank’s decision to augment foreign exchange
reserves by 5 percent of GDP has been prudent, and is being implemented consistent with
Chile’s commitment to a floating exchange rate. Given the additional costs of sterilization,
the government could consider extending the program to recapitalize the central bank.

20
44.
Fiscal policy remains well anchored by the structural surplus rule, which helps
keep expenditure increases consistent with macroeconomic stability. Staff welcomes the
focus on improving the already high quality of public spending, including by increasing
efficiency and strengthening governance in the public sector. The temporary use of fiscal
means to alleviate the impact of higher food and energy prices is appropriate, and the staff
recommends to keep the measures targeted at the most vulnerable segments of the
population.
45.
The government’s efforts to further strengthen the management of Chile’s SWFs
are well placed. Staff welcomes plans to invest parts of the Pension Reserve Fund and Fund
for Economic and Social Stabilization into assets with variable returns, as well as Chile’s
contributions to developing sound practices for SWFs. An evaluation of Chile’s long-term
copper wealth would assist in formulating a long-term investment strategy.
46.
To enhance the efficiency of Chile’s capital markets, the authorities plan to boost
competition and increase the attractiveness of local markets to foreign investors.
Consolidating public debt issuance into fewer benchmark issues and lowering regulatory and
tax barriers for foreign investors would increase market liquidity. An FSAP Update could
help in identifying financial vulnerabilities and further reform priorities.
47.
The mission encouraged the authorities to consider further labor market reforms,
building on recent recommendations by a presidential commission. Preserving labor market
flexibility remains key in helping the economy adjust to major changes in relative prices.
48.
It is recommended that the next Article IV consultation take place on the regular
12-month cycle.

21
Box 1: Inflation and Exchange Rate Developments in Perspective
Chile’s inflation rate has recently increased more than in other countries. A strong interest
rate response since mid-2007 has contributed to a larger appreciation than elsewhere.
Chile’s headline inflation rate was
8.9 percent in May 2008, driven by larger
food and energy price increases than
elsewhere. Inflation was more than double
the inflation target (3 percent), and the
highest level over the past twelve years. The
contributions of food and fuel prices to the
rise in inflation in 2007 were more than three
times as large as in other Latin American
countries, and even larger compared to
advanced inflation-targeting countries.

The severity of the impact on Chile relative
to elsewhere has two main explanations.
First, the shares of food and fuel prices in
Chile’s CPI (27 and 4 percent, respectively) are large relative to other countries, especially
advanced countries, and the absence of subsidies implies that there is high pass-through to
domestic prices of these goods. Second, Chile experienced a set of additional, largely weatherrelated shocks to food and energy supply at home.

The Central Bank of Chile’s response to higher inflation since June last year was among the
most aggressive by inflation-targeting peers. This helped keep long-term inflation
expectations anchored around the 3 percent target. In combination with resurgent copper
prices, monetary tightening also contributed to the stronger appreciation of the peso compared
to some other inflation targeters’ currencies.

22
Box 2. An Alternative Global Scenario
Economic developments in Chile are closely linked to the world economy, and less to a specific
trading partner. Yet, the economy appears fairly resilient to a global downturn.
The staff employs a Bayesian VAR (BVAR) model to incorporate the impact of real and
financial sector linkages between Chile and the global economy into its forecasts. The BVAR
relates domestic growth to world GDP, the interest rate on U.S. high-yield debt, copper prices,
domestic investment, and the exchange rate.1
In the baseline scenario, model
simulations show a strengthening
of the economy after the unwinding
of recent financial and commodity
price shocks. Using the assumptions
underlying the Spring 2008
Regional Economic Outlook (REO),
the model produces a growth path
similar to the staff’s baseline
forecast of 4½ percent growth in
2008 and 2009.

returning gradually to trend
growth. Yet, the probability of a severe recession would still appear low as the macroeconomic
framework would provide for a significant countercyclical stimulus through domestic shortterm interest rates, the exchange rate, and fiscal policy combined.

Box 3: Participation of Foreign Banks in Chile’s Banking System
Foreign-owned banks account for about
40 percent of total outstanding credit in
Chile, historically higher than in most of its
neighbors. The concentration among
parent countries creates a channel for the
transmission of country-specific shocks.

Cross-border claims of foreign banks on
Chile rose by more than half to $34 billion
(21 percent of GDP) over the past two
years. While two thirds of the change
reflect exchange rate fluctuations, there has
been some increase in borrowing by
domestic banks recently as pension funds
are likely to shift parts of their deposits
abroad. Subsidiaries of foreign banks hold
$50 billion in credit on local counterparts,
but the overall share of foreign bank
liabilities remains low at 7 percent.
The presence of foreign banks in Chile
does not appear unduly large. Although
foreign banks account for a large share of
the banking system, Chilean corporates
have access to financing through a welldeveloped domestic bond market. Partly as
a result, claims by foreign banks account for
a smaller share of GDP than in much of
emerging Europe, and are of an order of
magnitude comparable to countries such as
Korea and South Africa.
However, geographical concentration
among foreign banks could provide a
possible transmission channel for financial
shocks. In recent years, Spanish banks have
significantly increased their presence in
Chile, and European institutions now
account for about 80 percent of
consolidated claims on Chile. Hence, there
may be a risk that tighter credit or liquidity
conditions in Europe would be
transmitted—possibly through local
subsidiaries—into the Chilean market.

Box 4. Assessing Chile’s Exchange Rate
The IMF’s multilateral CGER approach
finds the peso valued at about
equilibrium. Other models by the
authorities and staff estimate the peso to
be about 0-10 percent above a level
consistent with fundamentals.
On a real effective basis, two factors
have added to the appreciation of the
peso in recent months. First, the rise in
Chile’s inflation differential with its
trade partners has made domestic goods
relatively more expensive. Second,
Chile’s trade with Asia has increased.
With price levels in Asia below those in
Chile, the United States, and Europe, the
peso has become less competitive.
Both factors are captured in a real
effective exchange measure developed
by the U.S. Federal Reserve Board.1
The Weighted Average Relative Price
(“WARP”) is calculated using relative
purchasing powers and shifting trade
weights—and is thus well suited for a
country like Chile. According to this
measure, the peso has appreciated by
around 19 percent since early 2002.

ANNEX 1. CHILE: DEBT SUSTAINABILITY ANALYSIS
The public sector became a net creditor in 2006. Gross public sector debt fell to 9 percent of
GDP at end-2007, and public sector assets rose above 10 percent of GDP.
Due to Chile’s large public sector assets, the sustainability of public debt is not an issue.
The structural surplus rule has restrained expenditure growth during the recent period of high
copper prices, and the remaining outstanding external debt largely consists of bonds that
cannot easily be prepaid. While the small remaining debt stock is sensitive to some
alternative assumptions going forward, additional financing needs stemming from a worse
macroeconomic outlook could be covered by the country’s Fund for Economic and Social
Stabilization, which at end-2008 will hold around 13 percent of GDP.
The dynamics of Chile’s external debt are stable and less sensitive to shocks. Total external
debt fell to 32 percent of GDP in 2007. While the current account is expected to deteriorate
over the medium term as copper prices fall, nondebt flows are expected to account for a
substantial proportion of necessary financing. Debt levels are not unduly responsive to
growth or interest-rate shocks, but are somewhat sensitive to a depreciation, as all of Chile’s
external debt is denominated in foreign currency.

12/ Assumes that key variables (real GDP growth, real interest rate, and other identified debt-creating flows) remain at the level of the last projection year.

1/ Gross debt of the central government. The forecast for the debt stock implicitly includes the effect of the redemption of recognition bonds (amortizations amount to around 1¼ percent of GDP annually in the forecast horizon). The recognition bonds are converted to debt,
if the fiscal surplus is not large enough to cover the entire financing needs for the year.
2/ Derived as [(r - p(1+g) - g + ae(1+r)]/(1+g+p+gp)) times previous period debt ratio, with r = interest rate; p = growth rate of GDP deflator; g = real GDP growth rate; a = share of foreign-currency denominated debt; and ε = nominal exchange rate depreciation
(measured by increase in local currency value of U.S. dollar).
3/ The real interest rate contribution is derived from the denominator in footnote 2/ as r - π (1+g) and the real growth contribution as -g.
4/ The exchange rate contribution is derived from the numerator in footnote 2/ as ae(1+r).
5/ For projections, this line includes exchange rate changes.
6/ Defined as public sector deficit, plus amortization of medium and long-term public sector debt, plus short-term debt at end of previous period.
7/ Derived as nominal interest expenditure divided by previous period debt stock.
8/ The key variables include real GDP growth; real interest rate; and primary balance in percent of GDP.
9/ The implied change in other key variables under this scenario is discussed in the text.
10/ The two-standard deviation estimate is from 1996-2004, because of the exceptional growth rate in 1995 (10 percent) distorts the results.
11/ Real depreciation is defined as nominal depreciation (measured by percentage fall in dollar value of local currency) minus domestic inflation (based on GDP deflator).

APPENDIX II. CHILE: STATISTICAL ISSUES
Economic and financial data are timely, of good quality, and adequate for surveillance
purposes. Chile is in observance with the Special Data Dissemination Standards (SDDS).
Monetary statistics
Monetary and financial statistics are broadly in line with the Fund’s Monetary and
Financial Statistics Manual (MFSM). Deviations from the guidelines of the MFSM include
treatment of nonbank financial intermediaries as part of the private sector, and the use of
accounting valuation criteria, which are not always in line with measurements at market prices.
Nevertheless, for purposes of expressing in local currency, assets and liabilities in foreign
currency and indexed units of account, the accounting criterion is consistent, in general terms,
with the MFSM. Due to a change in the chart of accounts for other depository corporations
(ODCs) at the beginning of 2008, the central bank has not been receiving data from the
Superintendency of Banks in a format adequate to complete the compilation of monetary
statistics. The latest available data for ODCs correspond to December 2007. Efforts to solve the
problem are underway, and it is expected that by mid-2008 periodicity and timeliness of the
ODC survey will again comply with SDDS requirements.
Real sector
The central bank carried out a project for changing the benchmark and base year of
the national accounts to 2003. Annual and quarterly GDP series for 1986–2003 were
released in 2007. An STA mission that prepared the Report on the Observance of Standards
and Codes for Chile in April-May 2007 found that the legal and institutional frameworks for
compiling macroeconomic statistics are generally adequate, but the independence of the
National Statistics Institute (INE) needs to be reinforced. Also, there are no legal precepts
empowering the central bank to require private non financial institutions to respond to data
requests, except for information on foreign exchange transactions.
A much improved business register has been available since 2006. However, updates of
INE’s business register are partial and conducted on an irregular basis. The household budget
survey (HBS) is conducted every 10 years, instead of every five years. The data available for
agriculture, fishing, some services, and quarterly estimates are limited in scope. Nonetheless,
income tax and VAT records are used to fill in the gaps. Source data reasonably approximate
national accounts’ requirements and their coverage is satisfactory, although the timeliness of
the INE’s source data could be further improved.
Chile’s national accounts are well established. There is some room for improvement with
respect to the treatment of mineral exploration; agricultural work in progress; own-account
production of computer software, databases, and manufacturing products; classification of
copper derivatives; the functions of government, and individual consumption by purpose.

4
Coverage of price and labor market statistics should be widened. For the CPI, expanding
the survey sample outside Santiago and updating the weights to the 2006-2007 HBS would
considerably improve the index. INE compiles a producer price index that contributed to the
improvement of national accounts estimates at constant 2003 prices. On labor market
statistics, INE introduced a new household survey in 2006, modeled on the U.S. BLS surveys
and in line with standards set by the International Labor Organization. The labor market
survey of business establishments could benefit from a similar overhaul.
Government finances
Following agreements reached with the Fund in 2002, the authorities have made
substantial progress in implementing the GFSM 2001. The authorities have developed a
statement of central government operations with consolidation of extrabudgetary central
government units, and the reclassification of budgetary revenue and spending. A new
functional classification of total outlays for the central government aligned with international
standards has been disseminated. In addition, separate sets of accounts were compiled for
municipalities and for public corporations. A detailed description of the methodologies,
institutional tables on coverage, and data for the entire public sector were made available in
the October 2004 publication Estadísticas de las Finanzas Públicas 1987-2003.
Following FAD recommendations, the Ministry of Finance increased the publication of
statistical data beginning with its October 2004 Public Finance Report. The report now
includes debt liabilities and financial assets of the central government, contingent liabilities
(especially government guarantees and concessions), and tax expenditures. In 2006, the
government began to publish a report of investments of its assets.
Progress in fiscal accounts is ongoing. The authorities expect to produce estimates for the
consumption of fixed capital, and apply accrual and cash accounting using the System of
Information for the Financial Management of the Public Sector. This will permit the
compilation of opening and closing balance sheets covering the central government,
municipalities and public corporations.
However, further improvements are needed. The most urgent are: disaggregating
subsidies and grants by level of government; disseminating more detailed data on functional
outlays by the level of government; disseminating data on military debt; and reconciling the
recording of interest across liabilities, especially with regard to dollar-denominated bonds
versus dollar-indexed bonds.
Balance of payments and external debt
The central bank compiles balance of payments and external debt statistics on a
quarterly basis, and publishes selected statistics on the external sector on a weekly
basis. Beginning in 2002, the central bank has been publishing the International Investment
Position consistent with the fifth edition of the Balance of Payments Manual (BPM5).

5
The coverage of the military sector in the external statistics is incomplete. In particular,
the accuracy of data on military imports needs to be verified, as imports that do not go
through customs are estimated by the central bank. Also, if the military receives external
credits, information on this may not be available to the central bank; therefore, such
financing may not appear in the balance of payments or external debt statistics. Published
data on military expenditure are outdated.

Statement by the IMF Staff Representative
July 11, 2008
1.
This statement reports on economic and policy developments in Chile since the
Staff Report was issued on June 19. The thrust of the staff appraisal remains unchanged.
2.
Recent data are consistent with staff forecasts of below-trend growth in 2008. Yearon-year growth of economic activity slowed to 2.1 percent in May, and the unemployment
rate rose from 7½ to 7¾ percent. On the other hand, the outlook for copper prices has
improved in recent weeks, implying a slight upside risk to staff forecasts for the fiscal and
current account surpluses.
3.
Inflation remains high. The consumer price index rose by 9½ percent in the year to
May, and the index excluding food and energy items by 8¾ percent. One-year-forward
inflation expectations have risen above 5 percent, and both market and survey-based longerterm expectations have moved into the upper range of the central bank’s 2–4 percent comfort
zone. On July 2, Governor De Gregorio stated that the return of inflation to target could take
longer than initially projected by the central bank, but that the bank would take all necessary
measures to ensure convergence over the two-year policy horizon. Staff will provide an oral
update on the outcome of the July 10 Monetary Policy Meeting.
4.
The peso has depreciated markedly over the past few weeks, returning to a level
broadly consistent with underlying fundamentals. Amid rising oil prices and slowing
growth, the peso has lost about 7 percent against the U.S. dollar since the Staff Report was
finalized (18 percent since its April high), and also fell vis-à-vis the euro and most regional
currencies. Updated staff calculations show that—in real effective terms—the peso is now
close to its equilibrium value, matching the CGER’s “about zero” assessment.
5.
The central bank has continued its purchases of US$50 million in daily auctions
since late April. Governor De Gregorio recently noted that risks for emerging market
economies emanating from adverse global financial developments—the key factor leading to
the bank’s decision to increase holdings of international reserves—remain in place.
6.
Congress approved the injection of US$1 billion into the government’s fuel
stabilization fund. The first of two equal tranches has already been transferred and will help
smooth the impact of higher oil prices on inflation over the next few months, including on
consumer products such as heating oil and liquefied gas. The government committed to a
review of the fuel tax structure and plans to request Fund technical assistance on this issue.
7.
The government on June 18, 2008 increased the minimum wage by 10.4 percent. In
real terms, the increase is likely to be close to the increase in the average wage over the past
few years. Changes in the minimum wage are not considered to have a large impact on
inflation. Nominal growth in salaries has continued to keep pace with actual inflation.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2008 Article IV Consultation with Chile
On July 11, 2008, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded the
Article IV consultation with Chile.1
Background
The Chilean economy has proved resilient in the face of strong economic and financial
headwinds during the past year. Rising world prices for energy and food have been
exacerbated by drought and a very tight domestic energy situation. Lower real incomes and
tighter credit conditions have reduced consumption growth, while investment—particularly in the
mining and energy sectors—has remained strong. Overall, the economy is expected to grow by
4¼ percent in 2008, followed by a gradual recovery in 2009.
Led by food and energy prices, inflation was close to 9 percent in the year to May. Although
nominal wage growth has broadly kept pace with inflation, modest productivity gains have
helped contain unit labor costs. The central bank has raised its monetary policy rate by
125 basis points between August 2007 and January 2008, and by 50 basis points each in June
and July 2008. The peso appreciated sharply in the first quarter of 2008, but has since retreated
from its highs and remains close to its long-term average value in real effective terms.
Chile’s external position has been stable. Notwithstanding the stronger peso, growth in noncopper export volumes has remained positive, although the current account surplus is expected
1

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On
return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the
Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the
Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the
country's authorities.

2
to decline in 2008, partly as a result of continued strong import growth. The central bank has
announced it would purchase $8 billion in foreign exchange reserves through the end of the
year.
With expenditure contained by the structural surplus rule, continued high copper prices and
strong tax revenues are expected to lead to a budget surplus of close to 8 percent of GDP in
2008. The government’s two sovereign wealth funds, the Pension Reserve Fund and the Fund
for Economic and Social Stabilization, now hold a combined 12 percent of GDP in assets, all
invested abroad.
The government continues to move forward with a bold structural agenda. In the financial
sector, the authorities plan to introduce initiatives aimed at enhancing market access for small
and medium-sized enterprises, increase market depth, and boost the internationalization of the
peso. A Presidential Commission on Labor and Equity has proposed measures that include a
reform of the unemployment insurance system and the introduction of a low-wage subsidy
aimed at increasing labor participation in the formal economy.
Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors commended Chile’s adherence to a prudent, rules-based macroeconomic
policy framework, consisting of inflation targeting, a floating exchange rate, and a structural
fiscal surplus rule. This framework has delivered important social and economic rewards and
has been instrumental for managing the copper boom and several adverse shocks experienced
over the past year. Directors commended the authorities’ over-arching objectives of eliminating
poverty and closing the income gap with industrialized economies.
Directors observed that the Chilean economy has been remarkably resilient to the impact of
global food and energy price shocks, which have been exacerbated by domestic energy
shortfalls and a severe drought. The increased risks to the outlook, in particular from the recent
rise of inflation, nevertheless require continued close monitoring. Directors considered that
monetary policy has been appropriately geared toward returning inflation toward the 3-percent
target over the two-year policy horizon. They supported the central bank’s readiness to tighten
monetary policy further as needed to keep inflation expectations anchored to the target.
Directors considered that the external value of the peso is broadly in line with economic
fundamentals, and that domestic policies remain consistent with external stability. They
generally saw as prudent the central bank’s decision to augment foreign exchange reserves to
provide additional cushion against external shocks, and welcomed the transparent and preannounced modality of these foreign exchange purchases. Given the additional costs of
sterilization, Directors encouraged the government to extend the current program to recapitalize
the central bank in order to facilitate a more rapid return to positive net worth.
Directors commended the government’s strict adherence to the structural fiscal surplus rule, a
cornerstone of Chile’s macroeconomic policy framework. The temporary fiscal measures to
alleviate the impact of higher food and energy prices are being applied within the rule. Directors

3
welcomed the government’s commitment to ensuring that future expenditure increases are
consistent with macroeconomic stability. Going forward, they recommended keeping social
relief measures targeted at the most vulnerable segments of the population.
Directors commended the authorities’ focus on improving the already high quality of public
spending, increasing efficiency and strengthening governance in the public sector. They
encouraged adoption of a formal medium-term expenditure framework.
Directors viewed as well placed the ongoing efforts to strengthen further the management of
Chile’s Sovereign Wealth Funds. They endorsed plans to invest parts of the Pension Reserve
Fund and the Fund for Economic and Social Stabilization into broader asset classes, including
those with variable returns, and considered that an evaluation of Chile’s long-term copper
wealth could be useful in formulating a long-term investment strategy. Directors welcomed
Chile’s contributions to developing sound international principles and practices for the
management of Sovereign Wealth Funds.
Directors welcomed ongoing initiatives to further modernize Chile’s capital markets, making
them more efficient, competitive, and attractive to foreign investors. They recommended, in
particular, steps to advance the internationalization of the peso, enhance market access for
small and medium-sized enterprises, and increase market depth and liquidity by lowering
regulatory and tax barriers for foreign investors, as well as consolidating public debt into fewer
benchmark issues.
Directors observed that Chile’s domestic financial markets continued to function normally
through the recent global financial turmoil. They commended the authorities for stepping up the
monitoring of banks’ asset quality, liquidity, and risk management, as well as working toward
strengthening the bank resolution framework. They suggested an IMF Financial Sector
Assessment Program (FSAP) Update to review the scope for further market reforms and
implications for financial sector stability and the supervisory and regulatory setup.
Directors encouraged the authorities to consider further labor market reforms, building on recent
recommendations by a presidential commission. Well functioning labor markets will remain
essential in helping the Chilean economy adjust and continue to achieve high rates of growth in
a rapidly changing global economic environment.

Statement by Javier Silva-Ruete, Executive Director for Chile
Alvaro Rojas, Senior Advisor to Executive Director
July 11, 2008
1.
Our authorities would like to thank the staff for a comprehensive and useful Staff
Report and Selected Issues papers, which reflect the permanent collaborative dialogue that
has characterized the relationship between Chile and the Fund. This year’s report
corresponds to a fully-fledged Article IV Consultation, after a streamlined version in 2007.
As such, this year’s report was produced taking into account the 2007 Decision, as it
explicitly incorporates an assessment of external stability and the real exchange rate and the
policy options for achieving and maintaining external and domestic stability in light of the
confluence of domestic and external shocks that have recently impacted the Chilean
economy. Given these shocks, Chile’s rules-based policy framework has provided enough
flexibility in order to respond to them, thereby mitigating their impact in order to ensure
domestic and external stability.
Outlook and Risks
2.
In 2007, Chile’s output grew 5.1 percent, broadly in line with potential output and
above the 4.3 percent growth of 2006. This result reflected the still favorable external
environment, a more expansionary fiscal policy, and an overall supportive monetary policy.
Growth was more dynamic in the communications, construction, and retail sectors, in
contrast with the electricity, gas, and water sectors which contracted, given the lesser
availability of hydrological resources coupled with ongoing restrictions in the imports of
natural gas and higher prices of oil. Such an idiosyncratic shock to the domestic energy
generation sector forced a shift towards energy generation using other sources, such as diesel,
in a context of unprecedented increases in the price of oil which resulted in energy prices
substantially increasing and directly affecting industrial activity. Reflecting this change in
the environment, growth weakened significantly during the second half of 2007. Domestic
demand grew 7.8 percent, mostly because of the continued consumption dynamism,
sustained by still favorable credit conditions and a solid labor market. Investment remained
dynamic, relative to previous years, mainly in the mining and energy sectors.
3.
The Banco Central de Chile’s (BCC) output growth forecast for 2008 was recently
decreased by half a percentage point to a range between 4 to 5 percent, with the balance of
risks tilted to the downside. Such a downward review is due to a less favorable external
environment stemming from the slowdown in the world economy, the ongoing financial
crisis, and the uncertainties associated with it; a slower domestic demand due to a less
dynamic consumption in a context of lower real income, less favorable credit conditions, and
potentially weaker conditions in labor markets. The main downside risks are related to how
the credit crisis in financial markets would impact emerging economies, which include the
possibility of a protracted slowdown in the U.S., the persistence of uncertainties in

2
commodity prices, particularly in terms of oil, the possibility of a large correction in the price
of copper, and less favorable global financial conditions overall.
4.
During the second half of 2007, inflation exhibited a significant acceleration, as CPI
inflation reached 7.8 percent year-on-year in December 2007, well above the upper limit of
the 3 ± 1 percent target. During the first six months of 2008, annual CPI inflation continued
to rise, reaching 9.5 percent in June 2008. Such an increase in inflation resulted from
exogenous supply shocks, including a jump in global food prices along with a drought
affecting the prices of domestic food items, both of which have proved to be deeper and more
persistent than initially anticipated, as well as increases in energy costs and disruptions in
energy supply. In line with these developments, core inflation measures and other inflation
trend indicators have also remained above the 3 percent target level. The nominal wages
growth rate has been in line with traditional indexation clauses while real wage growth has
decelerated, showing that second-round effects have been for now relatively contained and in
line with historical patterns. From January to mid-April 2008, the Chilean Peso (CLP)
appreciated significantly, in part reflecting the weakness of the U.S. dollar, as well as the
improved price of copper and the increased interest rate differential with the U.S., due to the
aggressive interest rate cuts that the Federal Reserve has conducted in 2008. However, since
mid-April, the peso depreciated to a level similar to that of December 2007, a process that
can only be partially associated with the intervention policy of the BCC.
5.
CPI inflation is expected to remain above the upper limit of the target range during
2008, due to high oil prices and further increases in domestic food prices. Fiscal measures to
reduce the impact of high oil prices on the domestic gasoline prices have helped to somewhat
mitigate the risk of an excessive additional propagation of supply shocks to underlying price
pressures. CPI inflation is expected to gradually move down toward the target range in the
first half of 2009, converging to 3 percent by 2010. In line with these developments and in
order to ensure inflation convergence to 3 percent in the policy horizon, the Central Bank has
already raised the monetary policy interest rate by 175 basis points since mid-2007, bringing
it to 6.75 percent in June 2008. The Central Bank’s Board stands ready to act in order to
fulfill its commitment to price stability by further reducing the monetary impulse in order to
avoid an undesired postponement of convergence of inflation to the target, given current
inflation risks.
Exchange Rate Valuation and External Stability
6.
In terms of Chile’s exchange rate valuation, the Staff Report indicates that at the time
of the assessment the CLP was currently valued at a level in line with fundamentals or
slightly overvalued. Our authorities concur with this assessment. After appreciating
markedly during the first three and a half months of 2008, the peso has again reached levels
similar to the ones observed by the end of last year. The main reasons behind such
temporary misalignment were external as well as domestic. Among the external factors, the
generalized weakening of the USD, due to global imbalances which coupled with persistent

3
high copper prices and an aggressive loosening of monetary policy in the U.S., coincided
with an increase in the monetary policy rate, and the expectation of further monetary
tightening by market participants earlier this year. Such developments impacted the CLP
directly, so that in the first quarter of 2008, the CLP was one of the fastest appreciating
currencies against the USD, accumulating a 12.2 percent nominal appreciation, reaching a
high of CLP 429 in mid-March of 2008. At such a level, the CEGR analysis of April 2008
found the peso to be overvalued in real effective terms.
7.
On April 10, the BCC announced a reserves purchase program of USD 8 billion from
April to December 2008 to increase its foreign exchange liquidity in order to be better
equipped to confront a worsening and uncertain international scenario. This measure was
consistent with the assessment that the strength of the peso at the time, relative to its long
term fundamental value, provided a financially sound opportunity for the intervention. The
purchase of reserves constitutes an investment in stability, as it would strengthen the
international reserves position of the BCC as the provider of foreign exchange liquidity when
needed. As indicated in the Staff Report, the reserves purchase program was implemented
transparently under pre-announced daily purchases of USD 50 million through competitive
bids with no target level for the exchange rate. As of July 8, 2008 a total of USD 3 billion
have been purchased with an average bid to cover ratio of 2.28. Given the pre-announced
nature of the reserves purchases, the program does not constrain the implementation of
monetary policy and it also avoids discretionary use of exchange rate policy for
disinflationary purposes. The Technical Note II of the Selected Issues papers provides
evidence that supports the authorities’ decision to increase the level of reserves to around 15
percent of GDP by end 2008.
8.
At the same time, the Ministry of Finance has implemented several measures in order
to relieve pressure from the CLP. Given the currency mismatch on the government’s balance
sheet, which stems from a large surplus position in foreign currency, the government allowed
exporters to pay their income taxes directly in USD for the first time in April 2008 and, as of
June 2008, they will also be able to pay other taxes in USD, while at the same time allowing
companies to have their accounting be done directly in USD. In early May 2008, the
Ministry of Finance announced the issuance of an additional USD 800 million in domestic
bonds in local currency, which will be used to recapitalize the BCC in USD, so the purchase
of the USD equivalent amount would provide additional relief to the pressure on the CLP,
which is in line with the reserves purchase program of the BCC described above.
Monetary Policy
9.
In line with the acceleration in inflation since mid-2007 through the direct impact of
the food and energy components given the high weight they have in the CPI, as well as due
to idiosyncratic supply shocks, as clearly presented in Box 1 of the Staff Report and in the
Technical Note I of the Selected Issues Papers, and in order to address the potential impact
on inflation expectations and second round effects, the BCC initiated a monetary policy

4
tightening cycle by raising the monetary policy interest rate by 125 basis points between mid2007 and January 2008, bringing it to 6.25 percent. The BCC paused the interest rates hikes
between February and May 2008, thanks to a lack of further inflationary surprises over the
first quarter and in order to assess the impact of the interest rate increases of previous
months. Consistent with these developments, the inflation outlook contained in the 2008
May Monetary Policy Report was broadly in line with the forecasts of the January Monetary
Policy Report. Further monetary policy decisions where in any case made conditional on the
impact of incoming data on the inflation outlook over the two-year policy horizon.
10.
Given the developments in the price of oil and the fact that inflation of food products
proved to be more persistent that initially anticipated, the short-term prospects for inflation
deteriorated markedly after May and inflationary expectations shifter higher. In light of the
worsening inflation outlook, and in order to ensure inflation convergence to 3 percent in the
policy horizon, the BCC raised the monetary policy interest rates by an additional 50 basis
points in its Monetary Policy Meeting in June 2008, bringing it to 6.75 percent in order to
avoid an undesired postponement of convergence of inflation to the target given current
inflationary risks. The Staff Report indicates that further monetary tightening may be needed
if further upside risks to inflation were to materialize. The BCC stands ready to act further in
order to fulfill its commitment to price stability, as clearly indicated in the statement of the
Monetary Policy Meeting in June 2008.
Fiscal Policy
11.
The implementation of the structural budget rule and continuing high copper prices
determined that in 2007 the Chilean government posted an overall surplus of 8.8 percent of
GDP. In the same period, revenues increased 12.1 percent in real terms, while public
expenditure grew 8.3 percent. For 2008, the fiscal surplus is expected to reach 4.8 percent of
GDP and, as of the first quarter of 2008, the government has already achieved a surplus of 3
percent of GDP. In order to prudently manage windfall revenues and in consistence with the
Fiscal Responsibility Law, the Chilean government has continued saving the surpluses into
the Economic and Social Stabilization Fund and into the Pension Reserve Fund. At the same
time, the Fiscal Responsibility Law allows the government to use its surplus to recapitalize
the Central Bank and a payment of USD 900 million is expected to be made during 2008, of
which USD 800 million will be financed by the issuance of domestic bonds, as mentioned
above. The 2008 Budget constitutes the first budget constructed under the new structural
surplus target of ½ percent of GDP and it prioritizes social spending in health, education,
innovation, and social housing. At the same time, it focuses on the execution and quality of
public expenditure, as noted in the Staff Report.
12.
In light of the ongoing increases in oil prices in international markets, the government
has undertaken several measures to alleviate its impact on inflation and the overall level of
economic activity. Thus, in January 2008 the government submitted a bill to Congress
destined to provide an additional injection of USD 200 million to the Fuel Prices

5
Stabilization Fund (FPSF). In March 2008, the government sent another bill to Congress to
reduce the excise tax on gasoline by 25 percent for the next 2 years, until March 2010.
Congress approved both measures and gasoline and consumer prices reduced significantly in
relation to observed prices at the end of 2007. In June 2008, the government sent a bill to
Congress to inject an additional USD 1 billion to the FPSF, as well as USD 250 million in
new capital to ENAP, the public refining company. The purpose of these new resources is to
provide an ample basis for the stabilization of domestic prices of not only gasoline, but also
other fuels, such as those that have a high impact on the population, i.e., heating oil and
liquefied gas, in a context of additional increases in the price of oil. These measures should
reduce the inflationary impact of potential further increases in the price of oil and other fuels
in the short run.
Sovereign Wealth Funds and Macroeconomic Policy
13.
Our authorities would like to thank the staff for very useful discussions regarding
Chile’s Sovereign Wealth Funds (SWFs). The Fund is currently providing technical
assistance to Chile to assess the macrofinancial linkages of the management of Chile’s
SWFs. In addition, a good review of the institutional background is provided in the Selected
Issues Paper, the international best practices, and how Chile compares to them, and some
preliminary suggestions going forward for the Pension Reserve Fund (PRF) and the Fund for
Economic and Social Stabilization (FESS). Even though Chile’s SWFs are relatively new
compared to other SWFs, our authorities have a firm commitment to manage the resources
accumulated in these Funds according to the international best-practice, and in that spirit, in
response to an offer by the Minister of Finance, the meeting of the International Working
Group of Sovereign Wealth Funds will be held in Santiago in September 2008. In terms of
management of the Funds, the Financial Advisory Committee recommended a new Strategic
Asset Allocation (SAA) which expands the current SAA comprised of sovereign and
agencies bonds (66 percent), money market securities and deposits (30 percent) and indexed
bonds (4 percent) to a more broad based portfolio in terms of asset classes, by incorporating
corporate bonds (20 percent) and stocks (15 percent), and currencies. The management of
this new asset classes will be outsourced to external managers by the end of 2008.
14.
Given the size of the resources accumulated in these Funds, returns stemming from
the investment of the Funds constitute an important new source of fiscal structural income
that is a new feature in terms of fiscal policy. During 2007, the returns from the FESS
amounted to USD 933 million (0.6 percent of GDP and 2.1 percent of total revenues) which
correspond to structural income. In terms of the real exchange rate, the establishment of the
SWFs to save abroad the windfall revenues of the government from the copper price boom
has also helped significantly in avoiding the loss of competitiveness that would have
otherwise prevailed. As such, Chile’s SWFs remain instrumental in preventing the
possibility of Dutch disease in light of the large positive terms of trade shock from
commodities prices.

15.
During the annual address to Congress in May 2008, President Bachelet announced
the establishment of a USD 6 billion Fund named the Bicentennial Fund after Chile’s
forthcoming bicentennial in 2010, which will be setup to secure a permanent income flow
from the investment returns in order to fund the provision of scholarships to study abroad for
a total of 30,000 students of professional and technical careers over a 10-year period. This
initiative constitutes a major investment in the improvement in human capital of the Chilean
labor force with the purpose of significantly improving its productivity over the medium
term.
Capital Market Development
16.
As indicated in the Staff Report, our authorities have concentrated their efforts in
increasing the promotion of foreign investor participation in domestic markets and a new bill
(Capital Markets III - MKIII), which aims to foster the use of the CLP as a fully
internationally traded currency, increases the depth and liquidity of domestic financial
markets, and promotes market access for Small and Medium Enterprises, will be sent to
Congress before the end of the year. In 2008, the government will issue bonds in the
domestic markets up to USD 2 billion. The purpose of this debt issuance is to provide
additional liquidity to the local fixed income markets, as well as to establish benchmark
securities to foster the development of the domestic financial market. It is also the first time
that a 30-year bond is issued by the Chilean Treasury. In reference to the staff’s
recommendation of an FSAP Update in 2009, our authorities are currently in the process of
analyzing such a possibility, as it would provide a useful means to check progress on the
recommendations of the previous FSAP of 2004, as well as a chance to address new issues.
Conclusion
17.
In light of the recent confluence of domestic and external shocks in terms of higher
energy and food prices, as well as the financial turmoil and its impact on world activity,
Chile’s rules-based policy framework has provided enough flexibility in terms of monetary
and fiscal policy in order to respond to these shocks, thereby mitigating their impact so as to
ensure domestic and external stability, even under the possibility of a worsening scenario.
