STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2013 ARTICLE IV CONSULTATION
April 30, 2013

KEY ISSUES
Context: Since 2003, close engagement with the Fund has helped Iraq maintain
macroeconomic stability, despite a difficult political and security environment, external
economic shocks, and a weak economic structure. In this context, the 2013 Article IV
discussions focused on strengthening policies to realize Iraq’s economic potential and
make growth more inclusive.
Outlook: The positive trend in oil production and exports contrasts with the weakening
economic governance deriving from an increasingly difficult political process and
worsening security. The authorities will be able to fend off the danger of the natural
resource curse if they can improve political and security conditions, strengthen economic
institutions, and implement sound policies. Fiscal policies should aim at financing the
needed social and investment spending while building up adequate fiscal buffers to
insulate the economy from oil market shocks. On the back of large oil exports, strong
current account performance is expected to result in the accumulation of international
reserves.
Main policy recommendations: The authorities need to be proactive in addressing
medium-term challenges and risks by: (a) ensuring fiscal sustainability and building fiscal
buffers to address volatility in oil revenues; (b) stepping up the liberalization of the
foreign exchange market; (c) continuing the prudent management of reserves held by
the Central Bank of Iraq and the Development Fund for Iraq; (d) deepening the reform of
the financial sector, including the creation of a level playing-field for private banks; and
(e) accelerating structural reform to promote private sector growth and employment
creation.

still many weaknesses:


The non-oil sector represents only 46 percent of the economy. Non-oil activity (services,
construction, transport, and a small agricultural sector) is highly dependent on government
spending, given the limited direct spillovers from the oil sector, which is operated mostly by
international oil companies.



The economy is dominated by the public sector. Government and state-owned
enterprises employ approximately

Box 1. Iraq’s Program Relations with the IMF
Fund engagement with Iraq over almost a decade has been instrumental to maintain macroeconomic
stability and build institutions. The Fund has been closely working with the Iraqi authorities in the context
of post-conflict assistance and Stand-By Arrangements since 2004. In the context of Fund programs, the
authorities were able to limit fiscal spending, contain inflation, and successfully restructure Iraq’s external
debt. They also reformed the Central Bank of Iraq (CBI) and implemented new laws and regulations in fiscal
and financial sectors.

Iraq’s IMF Program Relations

Of the two-year 2010 SBA of SDR 2.37 billion (200 percent of quota), only about SDR 1 billion was
disbursed. Despite two extensions for a total of three years, insufficient progress after the second review in
March 2010 precluded completion of the third and fourth reviews before the SBA expired in February 2013:


The program was successful in safeguarding CBI reserves from being used for fiscal financing and

protecting central bank independence in 2010–11. However, the CBI’s enforcement of exchange restrictions
starting in 2011 triggered a multiple currency practice in the foreign exchange market and led to the
nonobservance of the two related performance criteria.


In the context of higher-than-expected oil revenues, the authorities exceeded overall fiscal balance

targets in 2010–11, but spending composition was worse than planned because of continued slippages in
current spending and persistent PFM weaknesses. Thus, the authorities missed the end-2010 and 2011
performance criteria on current spending and the continuous performance criterion on external arrears.


Progress on structural reforms was mixed. The authorities initiated efforts to strengthen PFM

(introduction of the chart of accounts) and transparency (including becoming EITI-compliant in December
2012), bank supervision (co-sourcing with Ernst & Young), international reserve management (introduction
of investment guidelines), and central bank safeguards. However, there was little traction on broader
reforms, such as state-owned bank restructuring, which required political consensus across ministries.



Unemployment is high, and poverty remains pervasive. Unemployment is officially
estimated at 11 percent in 2011, although actual levels, particularly among the youth, are
likely to be considerably higher. Demographic pressure is strong, with 41 percent of the
population under 15 years. The labor force lacks basic skills due to years of war and
sanctions, and massive emigration since 2003. Administrative capacity is weak at all levels

B. Recent Developments
2.
The political situation deteriorated steadily since the withdrawal of U.S. troops in
December 2011. The government has been plagued by political infighting with increasing sectarian
undertones, exacerbated by instability in Syria. Ministers from various parties have been



Nevertheless, macroeconomic developments have been broadly positive:
Economic growth has accelerated from 5.9 percent in 2010 to over 8.4 percent in 2012,
when oil production averaged 3 million barrels per day (mbpd), the highest level reached
in the last 30 years. In 2013, staff expects growth to rise to 9 percent as oil production
increases to about 3.3 mbpd and activity in non-oil sectors (government services, trade,
real estate, construction, and transportation) picks up.



Inflation has declined, from about 6 percent at end-2011 to 3.6 percent at end of last
year, mostly as a result of lower imported food prices, and is expected to increase only
slightly in 2013.



Broad money declined sharply in 2012 after strong growth in 2010–11, reflecting
increased political tensions which are



Central Bank of Iraq (CBI) international reserves rose from $61 billion at end-2011 to
$70 billion at end-2012 (over nine months of imports, 33 percent of GDP) on the back of
rising oil exports, and fiscal reserves held at the Development Fund for Iraq (DFI) have
increased from $16.5 billion to $18 billion (six months of salaries and pensions, 8.5 percent
of GDP).



Fiscal performance has been mixed. Thanks to higher-than-expected oil revenues and
the under-execution of the investment budget, fiscal surpluses reached almost 5 percent
in 2011 and 4 percent of GDP in 2012. However, fiscal discipline weakened over the past
couple of years, with poor budget planning and execution, large off-budget spending (3
percent of GDP in 2012), low investment execution rates, and serious deficiencies in fiscal
reporting. The authorities also continued the practice of directing loans from state-owned
banks Rasheed and Rafidain to unviable state-owned enterprises (SOEs), mostly to pay for
salaries. The total stock of these loans reached 3.5 percent of GDP at end-2012.

2

These developments must, however, be interpreted cautiously because monetary aggregates also reflect
disproportionately large government and state-owned enterprise deposits.

The 2013 budget raises risks. In March 2013 parliament approved a final budget that
includes large unfunded commitments, which, if fully executed, would imply a deficit of 13 percent
of GDP, deplete fiscal reserves, and result in a financing gap of 7 percent of GDP. Draft pension and
public-sector wage laws under preparation may also increase fiscal liabilities.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

5.
The nominal exchange rate in the official market remained stable against the U.S.
dollar since 2010, but the rate in the parallel market increased. The CBI pursues a policy of de
facto peg to the U.S. dollar, providing a key nominal anchor to the economy. However, in 2011, fiscal
expansion and political instability in Iraq and the region led to increase demand for foreign
exchange. In late 2011 the CBI started enforcing existing exchange restrictions and introduced new
restrictions in response to concerns about money laundering and illegal foreign exchange outflows.
As a result, the spread between the official rate and the parallel market rate—which had been up to
that point below 2 percent—started to climb, giving rise to a multiple currency practice, and reached
over 8 percent in April 2013.

MEDIUM-TERM OUTLOOK, RISKS, AND SPILLOVERS
A. Medium-Term Outlook
6.
Over the medium term, Iraq’s macroeconomic outlook will continue to be driven by
developments in the oil sector (see accompanying Selected Issues paper). Staff projections assume
the implementation of sound macroeconomic policies and gradual progress on structural reform.
The authorities broadly agreed with the baseline scenario, but noted that policy implementation will
be challenging because of the complex political environment, large spending pressures, and security
issues. Staff projects that:
Oil production will rise
gradually by about 400–
500 thousand barrels per
day (tbpd) per year,
reaching 5.7 mbpd by
2018. The non-oil sector
will grow by about 5 6
percent and reach 51
percent of GDP in 2018.
Overall, growth will remain
above 8 percent over the
medium term.



Strong oil export revenues
will lead to higher nontradable prices and cause an appreciation of the real exchange rate.
Domestic inflation at 5–6 percent will be higher than inflation in trading partners.



Containment of current spending growth will allow a ramp-up in investment spending and
the build-up of fiscal buffers. Fiscal reserves are targeted to double from about six months
of salaries and pensions at end-2012 to 12 months by end-2018.

B. Risks and Spillovers
7.
Risks to the macroeconomic outlook remain high. They include (a) inadequate policy
implementation; (b) a deteriorating political and security situation; (c) a larger-than-projected
decline in global oil prices; and (d) delays in developing Iraq’s oil fields and oil export capacity. (See
Risk Assessment Matrix in Appendix 2). These risks can translate into lower oil revenues,
deterioration in the fiscal position, pressures to use CBI reserves for fiscal purposes leading to
depreciation pressures, and higher inflation. Policies to mitigate their impact include strengthening
fiscal institutions and oil revenue management, improving monetary policy transmission, and
reducing the economy’s dependence on the oil sector. At present, the authorities depend solely on
fiscal policy to address these vulnerabilities, underscoring the need for the authorities to urgently
build up sufficient fiscal buffers, since Iraq’s fiscal and external performance is very sensitive to
fluctuations in oil prices. The authorities agreed that building sufficient buffers is essential, but
highlighted that containing current spending to achieve this objective will be difficult in the current
fragile social context without broad political consensus. Outward spillovers are mostly related to the
impact of the oil sector on global markets (Box 2).
8.
A low-case scenario modeling a temporary decline in oil prices stemming from a
deeper-than-expected slowdown in emerging markets illustrates the economy’s dependency
on oil. Staff estimated the impact of the downside emerging markets Global Risk Assessment Matrix
(G-RAM) scenario, envisaging a fall in oil prices 15 percent below the World Economic Outlook
(WEO) baseline in 2013. Given the lack of other policy instruments, the authorities would respond to
the oil price shock in part through the worsening of the fiscal balance (which would require using up
fiscal buffers) and in part by tightening spending (mainly investment expenditure, as they did in
response to the decline in oil prices in late 2008). Both CBI and DFI reserves would be lower
throughout the medium term. Iraq is even more vulnerable to the tail risk of a much larger fall in oil
prices—of the magnitude of the 40 percent oil price shock of 2008–09—which would lead to the
complete depletion of the fiscal buffers held at the DFI in less than one year, additional tightening
(including on current spending), and depreciation pressures following the sudden drop in oil
revenues.

Box 2. The Iraqi Oil Sector: Perspectives and Outward Spillovers
The ramp-up in oil production represents Iraq’s main outward spillover to the global economy.
Medium-term projections of global demand remain subdued due to concerns over developments in Europe
and a possible slowdown in China. The IEA expects demand to increase from 90 mbpd in 2012 (of which Iraq
met about 3 percent) to about 96 mbpd by 2017.1 However, global capacity is expected to rise to
approximately 102 mbpd in 2017, with OPEC producing about 37 mbpd. Iraq is currently the second-largest
OPEC oil producer (its OPEC quota is currently suspended) and the third-largest oil exporter in the world after
Saudi Arabia and Russia. Staff expects Iraq to contribute over 2.2 mbpd in additional oil production through
2017. This amounts to 20 percent of the expansion in global production capacity and the biggest increase
within OPEC. Spillovers related to Iraq’s oil production might play out through two alternative channels:
Should global demand turn out weaker than expected, excess production could weaken oil prices.




Conversely, delays in developing Iraq’s export capacity could have a sizable impact on international
oil markets, putting upward pressure on prices.

At the regional level, the coming on stream of Iraqi exports might affect the pattern of energy trade
and consumption. The authorities are planning a pipeline through Jordan to diversify their oil export routes
and export markets by becoming a larger regional supplier of oil.

ROLES OF POLICIES IN MANAGING OIL WEALTH
A. Fiscal Policy
In the past, the fiscal stance was pro-cyclical, as higher oil revenues triggered spending increases. With
oil revenues soaring, political pressures to boost current spending will grow, compounded by
weaknesses in fiscal management. Discussions focused on (a) setting the appropriate fiscal stance in
2013, (b) addressing volatility in oil revenues through fiscal buffers, and (c) strengthening
macroeconomic management and fiscal institutions.
9.
Fiscal policy should aim at protecting social and investment spending by containing
vulnerabilities to oil revenue shocks. With a

the domestic economy. In this context, fiscal
policy should aim at building up fiscal buffers to
insulate priority spending from oil market volatility, and to create space for a countercyclical use of
fiscal policy, and increasing fiscal space for social spending and investment by rationalizing lowpriority current spending. To build up fiscal buffers, the authorities rely on the DFI as a de facto oil
stabilization fund. Given that the current legal framework precludes CBI lending to the government,
and that Iraq still does not enjoy access to international capital markets, DFI reserves can be seen as
an insurance against the impact of oil price shocks or export volume shortfalls.

better measure of the fiscal impulse to the
economy—would remain broadly constant,
posting a deficit of 73 percent of non-oil GDP. This fiscal stance would (a) contain demand pressures
on the non-oil economy; (b) maintain the fiscal buffers at the DFI to cover about six months of
salaries and pensions (equivalent to a negative shock of $19 in oil prices, or 500 tbpd in export
volumes); and (c) allow fully executing investment projects in the oil sector, while keeping non-oil
sector capital spending constant in nominal terms, in line with implementation capacity.
11.
Over the medium term, the authorities intend to continue rationalizing spending and
increasing buffers. Continued streamlining of current spending could result in sustained fiscal
surpluses and double the size of fiscal buffers by end-2018 to 12 months of wages and salaries. By
the end of the projection horizon, these buffers would allow Iraq to withstand a negative shock of
$36 in oil prices, the magnitude of the 2008–9 crisis, or a decline in exports by 2 mbpd, i.e., back to
2012 levels. The suggested fiscal path, if

conservative oil price and export volume
assumptions have been set in the context of
IMF-supported programs. In the future, the authorities could adopt procedural rules, preferably by
law, to help formulate the annual budget by establishing a baseline oil scenario, identifying sources
of financing, setting a realistic discretionary spending path, and assessing fiscal risks. In addition,
while Iraq does not yet have the capacity to adopt a numerical fiscal rule based on structural
balances, the authorities should consider adopting a simple formula to set oil price assumptions
based on a moving average of past prices which would help follow a path to build fiscal buffers.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

IRAQ

13.
Sound fiscal policy implementation requires strong fiscal institutions. A solid
institutional framework is needed to ensure that oil revenues are put to productive use in a
transparent fashion, and that the fiscal risks are properly addressed, including those arising from
contingent liabilities such as possible recapitalization of state-owned banks and enterprises. Iraq has
made some progress in adopting a chart of accounts, and has became a full EITI member in
December 2012, buttressing oil revenue transparency. The authorities agreed on the importance of
strengthening institutions, and confirmed their commitment to adopt a single treasury account, and
fully put in place an Integrated Financial Management Information System (IFMIS), which would help
improve spending controls, debt management, and fiscal reporting.
Box 3. Long-Term Fiscal Sustainability

The Permanent Income Hypothesis (PIH) model allows evaluation of Iraq’s long-term fiscal
sustainability based on its natural resource wealth (see accompanying Selected Issues Paper). The PIH
model determines a level of constant Non-Resource Primary Fiscal Balance (NRPB) in terms on non-oil GDP
consistent with an annuity derived from Iraq’s accumulated and expected financial wealth resulting from
future oil exports.1 While the model estimates are subject to large parametric uncertainty and data
weaknesses, they provide a useful framework to assess the sustainability of government non-oil spending
trends.

The PIH model suggests that Iraq’s medium-term fiscal policies, if implemented as outlined in
the baseline scenario, would be broadly consistent with long-term fiscal sustainability. Iraq’s projected
non-oil primary expenditures are significantly higher than the benchmark PIH expenditure level in 2013–
2016, but converge by 2017–2018. This frontloading—justified by Iraq’s large investment needs—can be
better modeled with the Modified Permanent Income Hypothesis (MPIH) model, which allows for a ‘scaled
up’ spending period, followed up by a ‘scaling down’ (increase in public-sector savings) to preserve longterm wealth. The need to save in later years could be lessened by the positive growth and tax revenue
impact of the additional investment spending upfront, which are conservatively assumed at zero in the
model. The results of these tools underline the critical importance of implementing credible spending
rationalization policies in public-sector employment, subsidies, and transfers in ensuring long-term fiscal
sustainability.

B. Monetary, Exchange Rate, and Financial Policies
With a severely underdeveloped financial system, high bank liquidity, and administered interest
rates, the usual channels of transmission of monetary policy are largely ineffective. Therefore, the
principal instrument available to the CBI is foreign exchange intervention, but its effectiveness has
been hampered by CBI regulations. Discussions focused on (a) distortions in the foreign exchange
market, (b) exchange rate policy, (c) foreign asset management, and (d) banking system restructuring.
14.
The de facto fixed exchange rate has served Iraq well. The authorities agreed that a
stable nominal exchange rate provides a valuable anchor for inflation expectations in an
uncertain environment, and intend to continue implementing this policy for the foreseeable
future. In the medium term, staff encouraged the authorities to consider creating the conditions
which would make possible a move to a more flexible exchange rate policy. Such flexibility could
allow a predictable and gradual appreciation of the nominal exchange rate, triggered by strong
oil revenues and the Balassa-Samuelson effect, to accommodate a possible real exchange rate
appreciation while keeping domestic inflation low.
15.
However, the authorities have been limiting foreign exchange supply to address
concerns related to money laundering and terrorism financing. The CBI has recently taken
steps to simplify foreign exchange market regulations, but has not eliminated all existing
exchange restrictions and the multiple currency practice.3 The CBI continues to rely on controls
to ration the supply of foreign exchange, which have contributed to the increase in the spread
between the official auction and parallel market rate. The authorities aim to liberalize the foreign
exchange market over the medium term. However, given the limited capacity of the financial
sector to implement Anti-Money Laundering and Combating Financing of Terrorism (AML/CFT)
preventive measures, they consider restricting the supply of foreign currency necessary to stem
illegal outflows triggered by regional developments and increased import demand financed by
illegal sources.
16.
In contrast, staff recommended liberalizing the foreign exchange market and
improving the AML/CFT regime. Staff noted that effectively limiting supply might be
inconsistent with a de facto fixed exchange rate regime. The CBI has ample international reserves
to maintain the de facto peg. Furthermore, AML/CFT standards do not contemplate ex-ante
controls on foreign currency transactions, but focus on customer due diligence and reporting
suspicious transactions to an operational and fully independent Financial Intelligence Unit. In
staff’s view, accelerating the liberalization of payments for current transactions would therefore
be the best approach to eliminating distortions in the foreign exchange market, the exchange
rate spread, and the rents it creates. It would also allow removing the exchange restrictions and

practice subject to Fund jurisdiction.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

17

IRAQ

the multiple currency practice, with a view to accepting the obligations under Article VIII. The
improvement of the AML/CFT framework, in line with the MENA-Financial Action Task Force
(FATF) recommendations, and FATF standards, together with the ongoing efforts in
strengthening AML/CFT supervision by the CBI, would help address money laundering and
terrorism financing concerns.
17.
The size of Iraq’s foreign assets (both CBI and DFI) is fueling a domestic debate on
their most productive use. Staff projections show that, while CBI reserves are broadly
appropriate over the forecast period, fiscal buffers will achieve an adequate level only in the
medium term. Furthermore, the legal framework and governance arguments do not support
pooling of CBI and DFI reserves. Moreover, the low execution rates of public investment, owing
to limited administrative capacity and
domestic absorptive capacity, suggest that
there is little scope for accelerating the
spending of foreign assets in the domestic
economy. Increasing the returns to
sovereign foreign assets might imply
adopting some form of sovereign wealth
fund (SWF) as exemplified by international
experience (see accompanying Selected
Issues paper). On balance, in light of the
need to preserve the independence of the
CBI and maintain a high level of liquid
reserves to address possible pressures on
the Iraqi dinar, and given Iraq’s weak capacity and governance, it seems appropriate to maintain
the current two-tier architecture composed of CBI reserves (invested following prudent guidelines)
and fiscal reserves held in the DFI. Should the DFI reserves increase beyond the recommended
level of fiscal buffers, it should be possible to modify the DFI structure to allow for a more active
management of excess fiscal reserves. The authorities agreed that the management of Iraq’s
sovereign assets should continue to be cautious, and that a separate SWF would not be
appropriate at this stage.

C. Supporting Private-Sector Led Inclusive Growth
With an economy dominated by oil production and public spending, the authorities will need to focus
on creating an enabling environment for private-sector development. A stronger financial system,
better business environment, and a far-reaching structural reform plan can boost private-sector
activity and employment.

Banking System
18.
Efforts to modernize the financial system have hinged on the reform of stateowned banks. The restructuring of state-owned bank giants Rasheed and Rafidain has been
lagging since its launch in 2006. Recently, the CBI has impressed new momentum to the clean-up

18

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

IRAQ

of the banks’ balance sheets from pre-2003 assets and large valuation losses. The next step would
be a rigorous audit of the balance sheets and the formulation of plans for their recapitalization,
which is likely needed. In the long run, plans to put Rasheed and Rafidain on a sustainable
commercial basis can be realized only if Rasheed and Rafidain stop lending to the government or on
its behalf.

Box 4. Financial System Development
The financial system in Iraq remains seriously underdeveloped. Total banking assets in Iraq are
estimated at 77 percent of GDP, compared to 130 percent in the Middle East and North Africa
region, and total credit is about 29 percent of GDP, compared to 55 percent in the region. However,
the headline credit figures reflects in large part loans and trade credit extended from state-owned
banks to SOEs. Thus, credit to the private sector is estimated at only about 15 percent of GDP.
State-owned banks dominate the financial sector. The 50 private banks are small and focused on
trade-related business. Banks Rasheed and Rafidain hold 71 percent of the system’s deposits.
Together with the Trade Bank of Iraq, established in 2003, they enjoy a symbiotic relationship with
the government, based on extension of credit to the government, the frequent execution of quasiTreasury operations, the almost complete monopoly over government transactions, and historic lax
supervision and shareholder control. While Rasheed and Rafidain are very liquid, they are likely not
solvent, even though their net worth has so far been difficult to assess given the lack of transparency
and the persistence of pre-2003 items on their balance sheets.

Development of the private banking sector requires leveling the playing field with
state-owned banks (Box 4). Options include opening up the market for trade finance for
government imports and allowing private banks to honor customers’ checks to the government.
Moreover, the ongoing operational strengthening of banking supervision centered on better
staffing, training and co-sourcing, and extension of the supervisory perimeter to include stateowned banks is essential to promote a sound banking system. In addition, the competitiveness of

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

19

IRAQ

the private banks depends on the modernization of their operations (many banks still lack a core
banking system) and strengthening of their governance structure.
Employment
20.
Despite the large size of the public sector, unemployment remains high. The oil sector
employs only an estimated 80,000 workers out of a total of about 8 million in the labor force. The
government absorbs most entrants to the labor market, with about 40 percent of the workforce in
the public sector, up from 31 percent in 2007. Job security and a generous pay structure in the
public sector set a high reservation wage and crowd out private employment. As a result, total job
creation has been weak, averaging around 1 percent a year. Female participation in the labor force,
at only 13 percent, is particularly low compared to international and regional standards. Aggregate
labor market indicators also mask large geographical disparity, with official unemployment in some
provinces at 20 percent.
21.
Over the medium term, demographic trends will put pressure on the labor market.
The Fund’s labor template, based on conservative assumptions (whole-economy growth projections
and average growth-employment elasticity estimates of MENA oil producers), suggests that
employment creation in 2013–18 will likely not be strong enough to absorb the 2.1 million total new
entrants in the labor force estimated by the International Labor Organization (ILO), leading to a rise
in the unemployment rate. These results should be interpreted cautiously given significant data
quality issues, but they do underline the need for higher growth or better job-creation strategies to
help generate adequate employment.
22.
The medium-term projections stress that the current employment model hinging on
public-sector employment may

authorities pointed out that the
public sector is reaching the limits of absorptive capacity to employ new workers, and that a new
model for employment growth is needed. For example, in 2013, the ILO projects about 300,000 new
entrants in the labor force, while the authorities expect the public sector to hire about 150,000 new
employees, and only 130,000 are projected to be taken in by the private sector.
20

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

IRAQ

23.
Private-sector employment creation is hindered by a very weak business
environment. Since 2003, the authorities have not undertaken any major reform to create an
enabling environment for the private sector. Apart from security problems, red tape is pervasive
and governance is poor. The country ranks 165 out of 183 in the World Bank’s 2012 Doing
Business rankings. Iraq fares particularly badly in starting a business, access to credit, trading
across borders, enforcement of contracts, and resolving insolvency. The poor state of
infrastructure—particularly the provision of electricity—constitutes a major hurdle for the private
sector. Moreover, private companies face competition from the large number of state-owned
enterprises—operating in agriculture, manufacturing, and trade—that are generously subsidized
and staffed, and enjoy favorable treatment in government contracts and access to public bank
financing.

Economic reform agenda
24.
Inclusive growth will need progress on the broad economic structural reform
agenda. In many aspects, Iraq is still largely a resource-rich transition economy in which the old
central planning structure has only been partly dismantled. Ambitious post-2003 reform efforts—
exemplified by the International Compact with Iraq—have been only modestly successful.
Without progress on the basic reforms, however, Iraq will not be able to promote employmentcreating economic activity outside the oil sector and government. Besides the reform of the
financial and fiscal sectors,4 the key areas of the economic agenda include:


Energy sector: A hydrocarbon law has been long delayed mainly because of disagreements
between the central government and the KRG. Investment in electricity production,
restructuring of electricity producers, and imposition of adequate tariffs are needed.
Moreover, distortionary fuel subsidies to producers should be removed.



State-owned enterprises: SOEs absorb large transfers from the government, and many
are completely inactive. The authorities should launch a comprehensive triage of SOEs,
leading to the operational restructuring, governance reform, and recapitalization of those
that can be rehabilitated and the closure of unviable enterprises.



Business environment and governance: Regulation should be streamlined, made more
consistent, and focused on assisting, rather than constraining, private-sector operators.



Agriculture: A revival of agricultural production (once one of the mainstays of the Iraqi
economy) depends on a reform of the PDS, which has contributed to the decline of
domestic production through large food imports.

D. Data Issues
25.
Macroeconomic statistics are broadly adequate for surveillance. However, there are
significant data gaps and lags in publication, mainly due to capacity constraints, security issues,
and lack of coordination with sub-national entities. The authorities are committed to
strengthening data quality with the help of Fund technical assistance.

STAFF APPRAISAL
26.
Despite a difficult security and political environment, the authorities successfully
maintained macroeconomic stability over the past two years. The authorities posted fiscal

surpluses, increased oil exports, kept inflation low, and accumulated sizable external reserves.
However, mainly because of limited advance on structural reform and foreign exchange
management, progress under the 2010 SBA has been uneven, and only two reviews could be
completed.
27.
The Iraqi economy has huge potential thanks to its large oil reserves. The challenge
is to use the oil wealth to address the economy’s weaknesses—including a small non-oil sector,
bloated public sector, high unemployment, and a weak business environment—and foster high,
sustainable growth and create an enabling environment for the private sector to create jobs
needed to improve the living standards of its people. Failure to do so could expose the economy
to the harmful effects of the natural resource curse—weak governance, rent-seeking behavior,
loss of competitiveness, and a stunted non-oil private sector.
28.
Fiscal policies must ensure sustainability and address risks related to oil revenue
volatility. Starting in 2013 and over the medium-term, continuous rationalization of current
spending, including public employment, energy subsidies, the PDS, and transfers to state-owned
enterprises will be needed to create fiscal space to finance investment and accumulate buffers.
Sound fiscal planning requires reform of public financial management, notably by introducing
IFMIS and a single treasury account, eliminating off-budgetary spending and investment rollovers,
and shutting down the quasi-fiscal operations of banks Rafidain and Rasheed.
29.
Fiscal rules can provide a framework for fiscal policy. In the first instance, the
authorities could establish procedural rules to improve budgeting, including a formula to set oil
price assumptions in the budget. Over the medium term, they should aim at building the
capacity needed to adopt formal numerical fiscal rules that would de-link oil revenues from the
budget.
30.
Staff welcomes the CBI’s objective to liberalize the foreign exchange market and
the recent steps to simplify market regulations. However, staff urges the CBI to take
immediate further measures to liberalize fully the supply of foreign exchange, with the objective
of lowering the exchange rate spread, removing distortions, eliminating rents, and ultimately
complying with Article VIII of the Fund’s Articles of Agreement. Staff also encourages the
authorities to refrain from introducing any new regulation that could lead to a breach of
obligations under Article VIII. In parallel, the authorities need to strengthen the AML/CFT
framework in line with MENA/FATF recommendations and FATF standards, to support their
efforts to deter money laundering and financing of terrorism. Against this background, staff
does not recommend approval of the exchange restrictions and the multiple currency practice
listed in the Informational Annex.
31.
The stable exchange rate has provided a valuable anchor in an uncertain
environment. This policy remains appropriate for the foreseeable future. In the medium term,
the authorities should create the conditions that would facilitate moving to a more flexible
exchange rate.

32.
The current two-tier architecture resting on prudent management of CBI reserves and
the use of the DFI as de-facto oil stabilization fund is appropriate. Given the highly uncertain
environment and low administrative capacity, staff recommends maintaining a high level of liquid
reserves. The authorities should also continue to rely on the DFI—probably Iraq’s most successful
fiscal institution—to provide oil revenue transparency and help stabilize government spending in
the face of oil revenue volatility.
33.
Staff welcomes progress in banking sector supervision and state-owned bank
restructuring. A stable and secure financial sector is a necessary condition for developing of the
private sector and diversifying the economy away from oil. Reform of the state-owned banks should
be combined with the development of private banks by ensuring a level-playing field for all banks
and more rigorous supervision.
34.
Iraq needs sustained high and inclusive growth to reduce poverty and provide
opportunities for its population. Growth prospects hinge on implementing a prudent policy mix,
enhancing service delivery, rebuilding infrastructure—particularly in electricity—and strengthening
the business environment. Boosting the activity of the non-oil private sector is crucial as the
employment model based on the public sector is reaching its limits.
35.
Efforts are needed to improve the quality and timeliness of economic data, as
weaknesses hamper analysis and policy formulation.
36.
Staff recommends that the next Article IV Consultation with Iraq take place on the
standard 12-month cycle.

Appendix I. Iraq: External Sector Analysis
The balance of payments is dominated by strong oil exports, leading to increasingly large foreign
assets and a likely positive net international investment position. The main vulnerabilities stem
from the dependence on oil exports and exposure to oil market volatility. The oil sector is very
competitive, unlike the small non-oil tradable sector. The exchange rate is broadly in line with
fundamentals.
The balance of payments
1.
The current account balance is in a structural surplus, owing to large and rapidly
growing oil exports. The current account surplus, exclusively driven by oil exports, averaged
6 percent of GDP over 2005–12. These surpluses enable the current generation to share the
benefits of current oil production with future generations. The main risk for the current account
balance is volatility in oil revenues (export volumes and prices).
2.
The financial balance is in a structural small surplus. The financial balance averaged
4 percent of GDP over 2005–12 driven by government borrowing, which is projected to taper off
from 2012 onwards.
3.
Large errors and omissions point to possible unrecorded capital outflows. Errors and
omissions have been generally negative, averaging -3 percent of GDP over the 2005–12 period.
Errors and omissions of this size can be expected in an economy with limited data and
administrative capacity, and the negative sign suggests that private sector capital outflows might
be unrecorded.
4.
The international investment position is estimated to be positive and improving. The
overall balance of payments surpluses have made possible the build-up of significant financial
assets abroad both in the DFI and in the form of international reserves of the CBI. As of end2011, authorities’ data show a positive international investment position of about $13 billion.
While more recent data are not available, with public sector foreign financial assets close to
$90 billion, commercial banks’ net asset position of around $5 billion, and external debt of
$60 billion (excluding possible late interest on unrestructured debt, mainly to Golf
Cooperation Council (GCC) countries, the net international investment position is likely to have
strengthened at end-2012. The investment position should continue improving given the projection
of rising external reserves and possible external debt restructuring.



In the absence of recent official data, the net international investment position is estimated using cumulative
balance of payments data.

Adequacy of international reserves
5.
CBI reserves are adequate. The central bank’s international reserves of $70 billion at end2012 (about one-third of GDP) are adequate for balance of payments stability, as indicated by
various measures of adequacy which are met with large margins. The extra buffer is appropriate in
light of the exceptional political and security risks in the country and in the region and the
dependence on a single source of balance of payments revenues. The staff’s alternative scenario,
simulating a 15 percent drop in oil prices below the baseline in 2013, shows that CBI reserves would
be adequate to absorb a shock of this magnitude. CBI reserves would remain at 2013 levels through
end-2015, after which reserve accumulation would resume at broadly the same pace as in the
baseline scenario.
6.

Various simple metrics can be used to assess adequacy:



Months of imports: The ability to finance the economy’s imports in the case of a shortfall in
exports is reflected in reserves expressed in months of imports of goods and services. The
nine months of end-2012 CBI reserves is well above the rule of thumb of a minimum of
three months of imports.



Greenspan-Guidotti rule: The rule suggests holding at least the equivalent of all
obligations falling in one year. In the case of Iraq, government obligations in the form total
foreign debt payments due, which amount to $1.5 billion in 2013, resulting in a ratio of
reserves to debt service of 4600.



Monetary measures: Particularly in countries with open capital accounts, the reserve
coverage of the monetary base is useful to reflect the foreign exchange demand
potentially arising from the conversion of commercial bank deposits. The coverage of
foreign exchange deposits indicates the capacity to meet the banking system’s liquidity
needs in case of a crisis. In Iraq, owing to the high level of reserves and the limited



Debt service on short term debt is excluded owing to lack of data. Adding government imports for 2013 (which are
paid by the DFI directly), annual obligations would increase to about $38 billion.

32

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

IRAQ

financial development, end-2012 CBI net foreign exchange reserves covered 122 percent of
reserve money and 104 percent of broad money, or approximately four times foreign
exchange deposits. In principle, therefore, the CBI reserves would be enough to cover the
complete dollarization of the economy. Additionally, a large part of deposits are owned by
government agencies and state-owned enterprises, making them less vulnerable to
confidence crises.


Comparison with peers: A regional cross-country comparison shows that the current
level of reserves as a percentage of GDP is comparable to its closest peers.

Exchange rate developments and assessment
7.
The real effective exchange rate has appreciated over the last three years. Since the
2009 Article IV consultation (from end-2009 to end-2012), the real and nominal effective exchange
rates have appreciated 12 and 7 percent respectively. Higher inflation in Iraq relative to its trading
partners has contributed to a 5 percent real appreciation over this period. As a result of this
dynamics, the real effective exchange rate was at end-2012 at about the level of end-2008. With the
central bank the main source of funds to the foreign exchange market, foreign exchange auction
regulations have led to a widening of the spread between the official and parallel foreign exchange
rates from mid-2011 onwards. Using parallel market foreign exchange rates, the real appreciation
from end-2009 to end-2012 was 8 percent. The share of foreign currency transacted on the parallel
market has varied over time, but it is likely to be relatively small. The weighted real effective
exchange rate is therefore likely to be closer to the rate based on the official exchange rate than that
based on the parallel market exchange rate.
8.

Competitiveness is mixed:



The oil sector is extremely competitive as the cost of producing oil—below $5 per
barrel--is among the lowest in the world. At these levels, neither the real exchange rate

level (which in any case has a limited impact on production costs) nor international oil price
volatility has any effect on the oil sector’s competitiveness.


In contrast, the internationally-contestable segment of the non-oil sector is uncompetitive,
as shown by the lack of any non-oil export sector and the extreme dependence on imports
for consumption and investment goods. Even food products are mostly imported, despite
the past importance of agriculture as source of exports. However, it is not likely that a more
depreciated exchange rate would increase non-oil tradable sector due to the much deeper
problems arising from inadequate public sector service delivery (e.g., security, electricity, and
rule of law) as well as aggressive public sector hiring, which drives up reservation wages of
certain categories of skilled labor.

9.
A quantitative assessment of the real exchange rate using the CGER methodology is
problematic. Applying the quantitative methodology is restricted by data limitations. Furthermore,
given Iraq’s turbulent recent history, it is difficult to anchor the analysis to a recent representative
period where broad macroeconomic aggregates, including the real exchange rate, were in
equilibrium. Of the three standard Consultative Group on Exchange Rates (CGER)-methodologies
(macroeconomic balance approach, equilibrium real exchange approach, and the external
sustainability approach), these constraints limit a quantitative analysis to the external sustainability
approach.
10.
The external sustainability approach confirms the broad alignment of the exchange
rate with fundamentals. Estimates using this methodology suggest that the current account
norm is a surplus of 3 percent of GDP. In comparison, under the staff’s baseline medium term
baseline projection, the average current account surplus is 4 percent of GDP. Therefore, the
estimated undervaluation of the real exchange rate is close to 10 percent. Given the large
margins of errors, these calculations suggest that the real exchange rate is in line with economic
fundamentals.

production in addition to the international oil
price. As oil production is currently ramping up,
the equilibrium real exchange rate may be appreciating notwithstanding the weakening of oil
prices. On the other hand, the current spread between the official and parallel exchange rates
may be suggestive of underlying fragilities that could warrant a real depreciation of the official rate.

Appendix III. Iraq: Debt Sustainability Analysis
1.
Iraq’s external debt burden continues to ease owing to progress in regularizing
Saddam-era external claims. As of end-2012, total external debt was $60 billion (28 percent of
GDP). In 2010, an agreement with China extinguished $6.7 billion out of total claims of $8.5 billion
and rescheduled the remainder balance on terms broadly comparable to those of the Paris Club. In
2011, $0.1 billion of small claim commercial debt (i.e., original individual claims below $35 million)
was extinguished through deep-discount buy-back operations and in 2012 Algeria agreed to cancel
fully its claims of $0.4 billion. With these operations, an estimated $42 billion of claims to non-Paris
Club bilaterals and small claim commercial creditors remains to be restructured.
2.
As of end-2012, total restructured and new external debt amounted to $18.2 billion
(8.5 percent of GDP). Current and prospective disbursements are fairly limited (the World Bank and
Japan International Cooperation Agency are the main partners) and it is expected that net external
public sector financing remain negative over the medium term. Under the staff’s baseline scenario, it
is assumed that remaining previous-regime bilateral claims are regularized and rescheduled on Paris
Club-comparable terms in 2013 and remaining small claim commercial debt are bought back in
2014. By end-2018, total debt is projected to be $20.9 billion (5.6 percent of GDP).
3.
External debt service is projected at about $2–3 billion annually over the medium
term. The debt service to exports ratio will double from 1.5 percent in 2013 to 3 percent in 2014
owing to repurchases to the Fund and assuming the regularization of remaining previous-regime
debt. Thereafter, the debt service ratio will gradually revert back to 1.5 percent. The debt service
ratio is vulnerable to an oil price or oil production shock, which would have to be extraordinarily
large to compromise the capacity to service timely the debt given Iraq’s large reserves.
4.
The public sector’s total domestic obligations have increased significantly since 2009,
but so have its domestic financial assets. Total obligations increased from ID 5.2 trillion at end2009 to ID 16.2 trillion at end-2012 (6.5 percent of GDP). The obligations are composed of (1) T-bills
held by the banking system and bank loans totaling ID 7.5 trillion; and (2) government-guaranteed
loans by state-owned banks to state-owned enterprises totaling ID 8.6 trillion. Given the financial
difficulties in the state-owned enterprise sector, the likelihood that these guarantees will be called is
very high. Public sector commercial bank deposits—ID 40.5 trillion at end-2012—exceed
comfortably the stock of government- and government-guaranteed financial liabilities.
5.
Domestic debt service is projected at about ID 2 trillion annually over the medium
term. Under the staff’s baseline scenario—which assumes the rolling over of T-bills, and no new
borrowing and issuance of government-guaranteed loans—domestic obligations will decline to just
ID 5.7 trillion (1.3 percent of GDP) by end–2018.

Implementation of HIPC Initiative: Not Applicable

Safeguards Assessments
The most recent safeguards assessment of the Central Bank of Iraq (CBI) was completed in 2010
under the SBA that expired in February 2013. While the assessment concluded that significant
safeguards risks remain, it noted that the CBI maintains important safeguards recommended by
previous assessments, including annual external audits by reputable audit firms and publication of
the CBI’s audited financial statements.

Exchange Arrangement
The CBI has been conducting foreign exchange auction on a daily basis since October 4, 2003. The
CBI followed a policy of exchange rate stability which has translated in a de facto peg of the
exchange rate since early 2004. However, from November 2006 until end 2008, the CBI allowed the
exchange rate to gradually appreciate. As a result, the exchange rate arrangement of Iraq was
reclassified to the category of crawling peg effective November 1, 2006. Since the start of 2009, the
CBI returned to its earlier policy of maintaining a stable dinar. Consequently, the exchange rate
arrangement of Iraq was reclassified effective January 1, 2009 as a stabilized arrangement.
Iraq continues to avail itself of the transitional arrangements under Article XIV. Eight exchange
restrictions (plus one exchange restriction maintained for national or international security) and one
multiple currency practice (MCP) are subject to IMF jurisdiction and approval. The exchange
restrictions are (i) the limitation that corporates can purchase foreign exchange in the auction for
import transactions only; (ii) limitation on the availability of foreign exchange cash for individuals
(i.e., one request per month);  (iii) maximum limits on the availability of foreign exchange cash in the
auction for banks; (iv) maximum limits on the availability of foreign exchange cash in the auction for



This measure gives rise to an exchange restriction because the limitation of one request per month constitutes a
governmental limitation on the availability of foreign exchange for payments and transfers by individuals for current
international transactions, e.g., basic allocations for tourist or business travel abroad, family living expenses, etc.
Furthermore, because of the limitation on the availability of foreign exchange in the non-cash auction to corporates
and only for trade transactions, individuals who need to make payments and transfers for current international
transactions beyond the maximum limit have no alternative means or channels to get access to foreign exchange,
except for resorting to informal sources.


This measure gives rise to an exchange restriction because the maximum cap constitutes a governmental limitation
on the availability of foreign exchange for certain payments and transfers, e.g., repatriation of certain investment
income by nonresidents, including remittances of profits, dividends or interest. Because of the limitation on the
availability of foreign exchange in the non-cash auction by corporates to only trade transactions, they would have no
other means or channels to get access to such foreign exchange beyond the maximum limits, except for resorting to
informal sources.

money transfer companies and money exchange bureaus; (v) the requirement to pay all obligations
and debts to the government before proceeds of investments of investors, and salaries and other
compensation of non-Iraqi employees may be transferred out of Iraq; (vi) the requirement to submit
a tax certificate and a letter of non-objection stating that the companies do not owe any taxes to the
government before non-Iraqi companies may transfer proceeds of current international transactions
out of the country; (vii) the requirement that before non-Iraqis may transfer proceeds in excess of ID
15 million out of Iraq, the banks are required to give due consideration of legal obligations of these
persons with respect to official entities, which must be settled before allowing any transfer; and
(viii) an Iraqi balance owed to Jordan under an inoperative bilateral payments agreement. In
addition, one exchange restriction maintained for security reasons should be notified to the IMF
under the framework of Decision 144-(52/51). The MCP arises from the absence of a mechanism to
ensure that the official exchange rate and the market exchange rate do not deviate by more than
2 percent.

Article IV Consultation
Iraq is on the standard 12-month consultation cycle. The last Article IV consultation was concluded
on February 24, 2010. The staff report (IMF Country Report No. 10/72) was published on March 16,
2010, and is available on the internet at

STATISTICAL ISSUES
A. Background
1.
Data provided to the Fund, while broadly adequate for program monitoring, have serious
shortcomings that significantly hamper economic analysis. Macroeconomic statistics have suffered
from years of neglect and recent turmoil has added to the difficulties. While the Central
Organization for Statistics and Information Technology (COSIT) remained in place, it lacks adequate
technical expertise and resources to address the requirements for a modern statistical system. At the
Central Bank of Iraq (CBI), statistical capacity is slightly better, but issues of interagency data sharing
and data collection responsibilities are hampering progress on external sector statistics.
2.
Since 2003, the Statistics Department (STA) has provided considerable technical assistance
(TA) in all major datasets, including on dissemination standards. The authorities participate in the
General Data Dissemination System (GDDS). The ongoing TA program takes into account the
absorptive capacity of the statistical agencies involved, and the contributions of other donors.

B. Shortcoming of Statistical Framework
National Accounts
3.
COSIT compiles annual and quarterly national accounts at current and constant (1988)
prices. Annual data of GDP by activity are available on the website of COSIT for 2003–10, and
quarterly GDP data for 2009–10 and the first quarter of 2011.
4.
The national accounts follow the 1968 System of National Accounts (SNA), however, with
technical assistance from STA, COSIT is moving towards implementing the concepts of the
1993 SNA. The quality of the national accounts compiled is poor due to the lack of source data.
There is no comprehensive source data available for estimating the value added by activity and for
GDP expenditure categories. Unreliable estimates of transport margins and goods imports, and
limited coverage of the activities of foreign companies operating in Iraq (including in the oil and
security sectors), smuggling, and other illegal transactions and activities are among the factors
limiting the scope of GDP estimates both by activity and by expenditure. A Household Budget
Survey (HBS), restaurants and hotel survey, and money exchange survey have been conducted
during 2007, but the results have not been fully utilized. An establishment survey was supposed to
be conducted in 2007, but due to the security situation, COSIT was not able to conduct the
scheduled survey. The data on the oil sector is generally adequate and timely, but there is little
information on nonoil economic activity. COSIT still includes the Kurdistan Territory’s contribution to
GDP by economic activities as percentages for each activity based on results obtained from previous
estimates dating back to 1990. Other activities that started in the Kurdistan Territory after 1990 are
not included. There are limited price and volume indicators which could be used for deriving volume
measures of GDP. The base year (1988) is outdated and needs to be updated. Work is underway to
move the base year to 2004.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

IRAQ

5.
Data collection is reasonably comprehensive for current price data in the formal sector.
Under current procedures, businesses employing more than 10 people must report calendar year
data by the following October, and small businesses need to report by the following June. Because
there are sizable penalties for noncompliance, respondents usually meet these deadlines. However,
with recent changes in the country, there is a risk that the timeliness of data reporting will
deteriorate.
6.
There is a shortage of quarterly and monthly indicators of economic activity and a lack of
timely data for services. Quarterly GDP estimates are based on a limited number of indicators––
crude oil output, electricity, rent of dwellings, and government expenditure. Nevertheless, for several
industries, extrapolating from out-of-date benchmarks adversely affects data reliability.

Consumer Price Index
7.
Based on the HBS 2007, COSIT compiles and disseminates a monthly CPI for all-Iraq
(including Kurdistan) and for each governorate. However, the CPI only covers the urban areas in all
governorates. Staffing is inadequate in number and training has been received only during STA
technical assistance missions. There is not enough computer hardware and software to process the
CPI efficiently. Recent technical assistance missions have focused on providing hands-on training on
methodologies for compiling the CPI and on methods for making adjustments in the CPI for
seasonality and changes in the quality of goods. Limited training has also been provided on
methods for constructing the producer price index (PPI) and the wholesale price index (WPI) and on
documenting the procedures and methods used to compile the CPI (metadata); work in this area is
continuing.

Monetary and Financial Statistics
8.
Notable progress has been made in developing the components and structure for compiling
a depository corporations survey, but the quality of the data continues to be hampered by several
factors: (i) the lack of sufficiently trained staff and adequate internal cooperation within the CBI; and
(ii) difficulty in collecting information on banking transactions in the northern region (Kurdistan). The
CBI has used a new report form, which provides more breakdowns by sector and type of financial
instruments to collect data from commercial banks. However, the CBI reports data for publication in
the IMF’s International Financial Statistics with a lag of more than three months and the latest
reported data are marked “preliminary,” indicating that there are problems with their data collection
and compilation.

Balance of Payments and IIP Statistics
9.
Balance of payments statistics are available to the Fund for 2005–2011 in the IMF’s Balance of
Payments Manual, sixth edition (BPM6) format. The CBI also compiles and disseminates an annual


The data were submitted by the CBI in BPM5 format and were converted into BPM6 format by STA, beginning in
the August 2012 edition of the IFS. The CBI reviewed the converted data prior to publication.

IRAQ

international investment position (IIP) statement. The quality of the information for recent years has
improved but timeliness remains a key concern. Further, the presentation is still limited due to
coverage problems and some deviations from the internationally acceptable methodologies. Issues
regarding the full recording of external debt data continue to impact the coverage and timeliness of
balance of payments and IIP statistics. International reserves are compiled consistent with
international methodologies and published in the IFS since end-2006.
10.
A TA mission (February 2012) noted that the quality of the information remains hampered
by the lack of data submission to the CBI from other government institutions and the private sector.
The paucity of data exist particularly in the areas of external trade in goods and services and foreign
direct investment. As a basis for reconciling flows and positions in the BPM5 framework, the mission
also identified a few data reconciliation issues, including inconsistencies in the classifications and
recording of portfolio investment transactions and positions. To help address these and other issues,
the mission proposed several recommendations, including improved interagency cooperation on
direct investment statistics; and adapting the international transactions reporting system to the
BPM6 requirements.

External Trade Statistics
11.
External trade data have serious problems of timeliness and are of poor quality. A new
customs form for imports is available but it is not being used at the customs border due to the
security situation and the lack of Customs Department resources at the border outlets.
12.
Coverage of private sector imports is constrained by data sources. Only goods that are paid
for through the Iraqi banking system are captured. Thus goods that are imported under external
payments arrangements (for example, imports for direct investment projects) are not recorded in
the balance of payments. The coverage of the external trade statistics excludes the northern region
of the country (Kurdistan), and no estimates for smuggling are made.
13.
Export data from the oil sector are received from the BOPSD at the CBI. The nonoil export
data, which amounts to the equivalent of 3–5 percent of total exports, are compiled based on
information from the customs export form. Nonoil export data are provided to the CBI on a monthly
basis for crosschecking purposes.

Government Finance
14.
Despite the difficult security situation, which has a direct impact on data compilation and
analysis, the provision of fiscal data for program monitoring purposes has been satisfactory.
Infrequent submission delays occur, and coverage of the Kurdish region remains sketchy. However,
the authorities are taking measures to address these shortcomings.
15.
In February 2005, an STA mission—held jointly with a parallel FAD and World Bank
mission—discussed a work plan aimed at building up reporting as an integral part of a major
rehabilitation of the budgetary, accounting, and fiscal management information system. The mission

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

identified institutional, technical, resource, and coordination issues that would need to be addressed
prior to developing the government finance statistics (GFS). These include establishing a macrofiscal directorate-general in charge of developing and disseminating fiscal statistical data,
implementing the classification for mapping the chart of accounts and budget classification onto the
format of the Government Finance Statistics Manual (GFSM 2001) (an area where significant
progress has been made), and preparing preliminary estimates of GFS-compliant data for general
government on a best effort basis. The Ministry of Finance has also set up a debt unit with the
support of external consultants. Iraq does not report government finance statistics for publication in
the Government Finance Statistics Yearbook (GFSY) or IFS. Currently there are no fiscal statistics
published by the government beyond the summary of central government budgetary estimates and
outturn.

International Monetary Fund

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

700 19th Street, NW

May 21, 2013

Washington, D. C. 20431 USA

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2013 Article IV Consultation with Iraq
On May 13, 2013, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded the
Article IV consultation with Iraq.5
Background
Iraq is exceptionally rich in oil, but its economy suffers from severe structural weaknesses, such
as a small non-oil sector, a dominating role of the government in all areas of the economy, and
a poor business environment. Nevertheless, partly thanks to the increase in oil production since
2003, Iraq has achieved a rise in GDP per capita from $1,300 in 2004 to $6,300 in 2012 in a
very difficult security and political context. During this period, Fund program engagement with
Iraq was instrumental in maintaining macroeconomic stability—even though progress on
structural reforms and job creation was mixed.
Recent macroeconomic developments have been broadly positive. Economic growth has
reached 8.4 percent in 2012 and is expected to rise to 9 percent in 2013 as oil production
increases to 3.3 million barrels per day (mbpd). Inflation has declined from about 6 percent at
end-2011 to 3.6 percent at the end of last year, and should increase only slightly in 2013.
International reserves of the Central Bank of Iraq (CBI) rose from $61 billion at end-2011 to
$70 billion at end-2012, and fiscal reserves held at the Development Fund for Iraq (DFI) have
increased from $16.5 billion to $18 billion.
Thanks to higher-than-expected oil revenues and the under-execution of the investment budget,
fiscal surpluses reached almost 5 percent of GDP in 2011 and 4 percent in 2012. However, with
a break-even oil price of about $100, fiscal performance is very vulnerable to oil revenue
shocks—either from oil price declines or export shortfalls. Furthermore, fiscal discipline
weakened over the past two years, with poor budget planning and execution, large off-budget
spending, and low investment execution rates. The 2013 budget includes large unfunded
commitments, increasing fiscal risks, including the possible depletion of fiscal reserves, if the
budget were to be fully executed.

5

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with members, usually every year.
A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial information, and discusses with officials the country's
economic developments and policies. On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for
discussion by the Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the Board,
summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the country's authorities. An explanation
of any qualifiers used in summings up can be found here: http://www.imf.org/external/np/sec/misc/qualifiers.htm.

2

The policy of a de facto peg to the U.S. dollar provides a key nominal anchor to the economy,
and the nominal exchange rate in the official market has remained stable since 2010. However,
since late 2011, the authorities enforced existing exchange restrictions and introduced new
restrictions in response to concerns about money laundering and illegal foreign exchange
outflows related to the increased demand for foreign exchange. As a result, the spread between
the official rate and the parallel market rate—which had been up to that point below 2 percent—
started to climb, passing 9 percent in May 2013.
Over the medium term, Iraq’s macroeconomic outlook will continue to be driven by
developments in the oil sector. Staff projects that oil production will rise gradually by about
400-500 thousand barrels per day per year, reaching 5.7 mbpd by 2018. Overall, growth is
projected to remain above 8 percent and inflation at 5–6 percent over the medium term.
Risks to the macroeconomic outlook remain high. They include (a) weak policy implementation,
particularly in the fiscal area; (b) further deterioration of the political and security situation;
(c) a larger-than-projected decline in global oil prices; and (d) delays in developing Iraq’s oil
fields and oil export capacity, possibly due to security issues but also insufficient investment in
oil infrastructure. These risks can translate into lower oil revenues, deterioration in the fiscal
position, pressures to use CBI reserves for fiscal purposes, and higher inflation.
Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors commended the authorities for maintaining macroeconomic stability in a
difficult security and political environment. With risks remaining high, including from oil price
volatility, they stressed the need to build fiscal buffers and further strengthen the institutional
framework. They urged the authorities to step up reforms to develop the private non oil sector to
help generate employment and inclusive growth.
Directors emphasized the need to implement sustainable fiscal policies and address risks from
oil revenue volatility. Rationalizing current spending—including public employment, energy
subsidies, the Public Distribution System, and transfers to state owned enterprises—is needed
to create space for priority social spending and public investment and to accumulate buffers.
Enhancing public financial management and avoiding quasi fiscal operations by the state owned
banks are also crucial. Directors noted that fiscal rules could provide a framework for fiscal
policy over the medium term.
Directors supported the objective of the Central Bank of Iraq (CBI) to liberalize the foreign
exchange market and the recent steps to simplify market regulations. Further measures are
needed to liberalize fully the supply of foreign currency, with the objective of lowering the
exchange rate spread, removing distortions, and complying with Article VIII of the Fund’s
Articles of Agreement. Directors considered that strengthening the Anti Money
Laundering/Combating the Financing of Terrorism (AML/CFT) framework, in line with the Middle
East and North Africa Financial Action Task Force (MENA FATF) recommendations and FATF
standards, would be more effective than restricting foreign exchange in curbing money
laundering and terrorist financing.
Directors agreed that a stable exchange rate, supported by a high level of international
reserves, provides a valuable anchor in an uncertain environment. They agreed that the two tier
architecture of prudent management of CBI reserves and use of the Development Fund for Iraq
(DFI) as a de facto oil stabilization fund is appropriate. They urged the authorities to continue to
rely on the DFI to help stabilize government spending and ensure oil revenue transparency.
Directors highlighted the importance of a stable financial sector in developing the private sector
and diversifying the economy, and were encouraged by recent progress in strengthening
banking supervision and restructuring the Rasheed and Rafidain banks. They encouraged the

3

authorities to ensure a level playing field for public and private banks by opening to private
banks access to government business.
More broadly, Directors emphasized that fostering growth in the private non oil sector requires
improving the business environment, investing in infrastructure and social capital, reforming
state owned enterprises, and enhancing public service delivery. Judicious use of the country’s
oil wealth can help address these pressing challenges. Improving the authorities’ capacity to
implement reforms will also be critical.

Public Information Notices (PINs) form part of the IMF's efforts to promote transparency of the IMF's
views and analysis of economic developments and policies. With the consent of the country
(or countries) concerned, PINs are issued after Executive Board discussions of Article IV consultations
with member countries, of its surveillance of developments at the regional level, of post-program
monitoring, and of ex post assessments of member countries with longer-term program engagements.
PINs are also issued after Executive Board discussions of general policy matters, unless otherwise
decided by the Executive Board in a particular case.

Statement by A. Shakour Shaalan, Executive Director for Iraq
May 13, 2013

Background
1.
On behalf of the Iraqi authorities, I thank staff for their engagement and the constructive
Article IV Consultation discussions. The authorities highly value the views of the Fund on Iraq’s
economic policies and appreciate the valuable technical assistance they receive from staff in support
of their stabilization and reform efforts.
2.
Notwithstanding very challenging security and political conditions, Iraq’s economic
performance was strong in the past two years. GDP growth picked up to over 8 percent, reflecting
higher oil production and buoyant growth in the non-oil economy. Inflation remained low. The
fiscal balance recorded surpluses and sizable external reserves were accumulated.
3.
Notwithstanding these favorable developments and the prospects of continued high growth
in the medium term─driven by developments in the oil sector─the Iraqi economy continues to face
challenges and risks. These include mainly a deteriorating political and security situation, volatility
in oil prices, and constraints in administrative capacity.
Fiscal Policies and Reforms
4.
In 2013, the authorities plan a more gradual fiscal consolidation than in the two previous
years, with the fiscal surplus estimated at 1.6 percent of GDP. They also intend to put in place a
medium-term fiscal strategy program that would cover more than three years. With oil revenues
soaring, political pressures to increase current spending are growing. In March 2013 parliament
approved a final budget that includes unfunded commitments, but implies a deficit that is less than
in some previous years. While the government recognizes the need to redistribute part of the oil
wealth among the population, it is also aware of financing constraints and the importance of
maintaining fiscal buffers. Accordingly, the actual execution of the budget will aim at meeting
priority social and investment spending, while maintaining fiscal buffers.
5.
In particular, the government intends to limit spending growth in subsidies for energy
producers, rationalize transfers to state-owned enterprises and to the universal Public Distribution
System, and contain the increase in public-sector employment. These measures would help maintain
the fiscal buffers at the Development Fund for Iraq (DFI) at about six months of salaries and
pensions. They would also enable full execution of investment projects in the oil sector, while
keeping non-oil sector capital spending constant in nominal terms, in line with implementation
capacity.

Monetary and Exchange Rate Policies
6.
The authorities agree with staff that the stability of the exchange rate has provided a
valuable anchor for inflation expectations in an uncertain environment. They intend to maintain
exchange rate stability in the foreseeable future.
7.
In 2011, the central bank of Iraq (CBI) started limiting foreign exchange supply to address
concerns related to money laundering and financing of terrorism. To do so, it enforced existing
exchange restrictions and introduced new restrictions. With the central bank the main source of
funds to the foreign exchange market, foreign exchange auction regulations have led to a widening
of the spread between the official and parallel foreign exchange rates. In the absence of sufficient
capacity of the financial sector to implement Anti-Money Laundering and Combating Financing of
Terrorism (AML/CFT) preventive measures, the CBI finds it necessary to restrict the supply of
foreign currency to restrain illicit uses of foreign exchange.
8.
The CBI is committed to progressively liberalize the foreign exchange market as capacity to
prevent AML/CFT is developed. It has recently taken steps to simplify foreign exchange market
regulations and this has led to the elimination of many exchange restrictions. The CBI is working
closely with staff on complying with Article VIII of the Fund’s Articles of Agreement, as well as
eliminating the remaining exchange restrictions and the multiple currency practice.
Structural Reforms
9.
Continued capacity constraints, compounded by the difficult political and security situation,
have slowed progress in structural reforms. Nonetheless, progress was made in the area of public
financial management, with the adoption of a government Chart of Accounts. The authorities also
confirmed their commitment to adopt a single treasury account. They will pursue efforts to fully put
in place an Integrated Financial Management Information System, which would help improve
budgeting, budget execution, spending controls, debt management, and fiscal reporting. With regard
to banking sector reforms, effective measures were taken to clean-up the balance sheets of the two
largest state-owned banks, Rafidain and Rasheed, of legacy external debt, losses related to the war,
valuation losses, and costs associated with issuing the new Iraqi currency. Continued progress is
being made in improving transparency in the oil sector as Iraq became a full member of the
Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative in December 2012.
10.
The authorities appreciate staff’s work on sovereign wealth fund options. They concur with
staff’s view that the DFI is a successful and transparent fiscal institution, which helped Iraq mitigate
the effects of negative oil price shocks. They consider that the DFI has been operating as a de facto
stabilization fund, allowing the government to accumulate reserves through strong fiscal
performance in boom years, and financing spending when oil revenues fall short.

11.
Staff notes that growth prospects hinge on implementing a prudent policy mix, enhancing
service delivery, rebuilding infrastructure and strengthening the business environment. The
authorities fully share this assessment. They are aware that promoting the non-oil private sector is
crucial as the employment model based on the public sector is reaching its limits. In an effort to
address Iraq’s growth and development needs, the Ministry of Planning prepared a five-year
National Development Plan following an extensive consultative process. The plan is now being
discussed by the Cabinet.
