TUNISIA
Staff Report for the 2006 Article IV Consultation
Prepared by the Staff Representatives for the 2006 Consultation with Tunisia
Approved by Amor Tahari and Scott Brown
May 10, 2006
• Discussions for the 2006 Article IV consultation were held in Tunis from December 5

to 19, 2005. The staff team consisted of Mr. Fanizza (head), Ms. Koranchelian,
Messrs. Bouhga-Hagbe, Senhadji, and Söderling (all MCD). Mr. Tahari (MCD)
joined part of the mission.
• The mission met with Governor Baccar (Central Bank of Tunisia), Minister Kechiche

(Finance), other cabinet members, and government officials. The staff also met with
the main trade union, the private business association, and with representatives from
the banking sector. Mr. Rouai, Senior Advisor to the Executive Director, attended
most of the meetings. A press conference was held at the end of the mission.
• Joint Fund-Bank missions to update the 2002 Financial Sector Assessment Program

(FSAP) took place in January and March 2006.
• After exiting Fund-supported programs in the early 1990s, Tunisia has maintained a

close dialogue with Fund staff. Over the years, the Fund has played the role of a
trusted policy advisor, and the authorities have retained full ownership of the
economic reform program. In recent years, the policy dialogue has focused on three
major areas: (a) reforming the macroeconomic framework, in part to support the
authorities’ plans to liberalize the external capital account; (b) addressing banking
sector weaknesses, most recently through the 2006 FSAP update, which should
contribute to sharpening their strategy to deal with high nonperforming loans; and (c)
accelerating structural reforms.
• Tunisia accepted the obligations of Article VIII, sections 2(a), 3, and 4, in 1993. The

de facto exchange rate regime is a managed float with no pre-determined path.
• The principal authors of this report are Ludvig Söderling and Domenico Fanizza.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
•

The Tunisian economy continues to show strength and the outlook is favorable. Real GDP
growth remained relatively strong in 2005, the external current account deficit narrowed
significantly—helped by further real exchange rate depreciation—and international
reserves continued to increase. Growth is expected to accelerate in 2006, as agricultural
productions recover and the service and industry sectors remain strong.

•

While increased financial inflows present a challenge for monetary policy, the current
macroeconomic stance remains appropriate and inflation subdued. However, should these
inflows persist, it will be essential to accompany monetary policy with a more ambitious
fiscal consolidation plan, additional external debt repayments, accelerated trade
liberalization, and increased exchange rate flexibility.

•

The fiscal deficit widened somewhat in 2005, due to the impact of high oil prices on
subsidies, but is expected to return to 3 percent of GDP in 2006. The authorities continue
to raise retail petroleum prices, with a view to fully liberalizing these prices in the coming
years. On the revenue side, they are undertaking tax policy and administration reforms,
following FAD technical assistance in 2005. The medium-term objective is to bring public
debt below 50 percent of GDP, from 60 percent currently.

•

Tunisia is in the process of gradually opening up the external capital account and moving
to a floating exchange rate. Significant further progress needs to be underpinned by
banking sector reform, debt reduction, full implementation of the new broad money
targeting framework, and deeper money and exchange markets.

•

Tackling financial sector weaknesses, already started by the authorities, is the most
pressing reform priority. Although banking sector indicators improved significantly in
2005, nonperforming loans (NPLs) remain high (about 21 percent of total loans) and
provisioning low (47 percent of NPLs). While not of systemic proportions, banking sector
vulnerabilities constitute a drag on growth and hinder any substantial advance on the
capital account liberalization agenda. The recent FSAP update should contribute to
enhancing the reform strategy.

•

Reducing external debt (68 percent of GDP) is another policy priority. The partial
privatization of Tunisie Télécom in 2006 (valued at $2.3 billion, or 7½ percent of GDP)
provides a unique opportunity in this regard. Over the medium term, continued fiscal
consolidation will be crucial to strengthen Tunisia’s external position.

•

Improving growth prospects will also require enhancing labor market flexibility and
improving the business climate.

The latest available poverty indicators from the World Bank show that the incidence of extreme poverty was
cut in half (to 4 percent of the population) between 1995 and 2000, while the share of economically vulnerable
fell from 9 to 6 percent of the population during the same period. These indicators are likely to have improved
further in recent years due to an acceleration in growth and a reduction in unemployment.

Box 1. Tunisia: Exchange Rate Regime1
• Until around 2000, Tunisia targeted the Real Effective Exchange Rate (REER). The country avoided the
potential risks associated with REER targeting thanks to prudent monetary and fiscal policies (for details see
IMF Country Report No. 02/120 and WP/02/190).
• Since 2000, in accordance with Fund advice, the BCT has reduced its intervention in the foreign exchange
market and allowed for more flexibility in the exchange rate, in effect leading to a trend real depreciation.
• The current managed float is an intermediate step toward a floating exchange rate regime.
_________________
1

Tunisia maintains a multiple currency practice resulting from exchange rate guarantees extended prior to 1988,
which will expire shortly.

2.
Nevertheless, the
authorities’ objectives of
approaching emerging market
OECD standards of living and
substantially reducing the
unemployment rate have not yet
been achieved. Bridging the percapita income gap in PPP terms
with countries such as Mexico or
Poland within a decade would
require a growth differential of
2-4 percentage points in favor of
Tunisia – at least 1-1½ percentage
points higher than in the recent past.
Moreover, despite recent
improvements, the unemployment
rate remains high (14 percent) and
increasingly affects university
graduates.

regional and global economy.
Indeed, recent Fund surveillance has focused on the need to step up structural reform and to
strengthen the macroeconomic policy framework. While trade liberalization has already
subjected the country to foreign competition, the authorities recognize that a significant
margin remains for improving the competitiveness and flexibility of the economy. To remedy
high unemployment among graduates, the authorities agree that the structural transformation
of the economy must accelerate, to increase the weight of skill-intensive sectors. This would

-6-

in turn lead to higher productivity growth, the engine for sustainable economic growth. To
address these challenges, the authorities, in collaboration with the Fund, have developed a
growth strategy encompassing continued structural reforms, combined with a gradual move
toward an open external capital account and a floating exchange rate (Box 2).2

Moreover, to improve the chance of success of this strategy, Tunisia needs to
address two main vulnerabilities:
•

A high external debt. Significant foreign borrowing by the government (two-thirds of
total public debt) has contributed to bring external debt to about 68 percent of GDP in
20053 – a high ratio compared to lower-tier OECD countries and other emerging
economies with similar sovereign credit ratings as Tunisia. External vulnerability tests

2

A detailed plan for capital account liberalization in Tunisia has been laid down in the Selected Issues Paper for
the 2002 Article IV Consultation (IMF Country Report No. 02/120; 06/17/2002).

3

Since the last Article IV consultation, the authorities have revised their short-term external debt figures to
include commercial debt (adding about 6 percentage points to the external debt-to-GDP ratio). For details, see
the preliminary conclusions for the 2006 Article IV consultation mission, at
http://www.imf.org/external/np/ms/2006/012006.htm.

-7indicate that Tunisia’s external debt/GDP ratio is sensitive to currency fluctuations.4
Nevertheless, the external current account has strengthened significantly in the past three
years, private capital inflows have surged, official reserves have doubled,5 and the external
debt-to-GDP ratio has remained stable despite a significant real depreciation of the dinar.
During this time, the external current account deficit has increasingly been financed by
foreign direct investment (FDI). In addition, Tunisia has enjoyed investment grade
sovereign debt ratings since 1994 and is perceived by investors as among the safer
emerging market borrowers.
•

Banking sector weaknesses. The BCT has maintained considerable influence on credit
extended to the private sector, through commercial banks’ dependence on central bank
refinancing. In the past, the BCT used this power not only to keep credit growth and
inflation in check but also to promote credit to certain sectors regarded by the authorities
as priority sectors, such as tourism. This led to a weak credit culture, especially among
government-owned banks, and large nonperforming loans (NPLs) emerged as a result.
Vulnerabilities were exacerbated by shocks to the tourism sector in 2001 and 2002, and by
ongoing trade liberalization putting competitive pressure on the industrial sector.6 While
banking sector weaknesses do not amount to systemic risks in the short term,7 they remain
serious. In fact, banking sector vulnerabilities not only constitute a bottleneck that could
negatively affect the growth outlook, but also hinder any substantial advance on the capital
account liberalization agenda.8

4

However, the vulnerability exercise reveals only limited sensitivity to shocks to growth, interest rates, and the
current account balance.

5

Regarding the adequacy of official reserves, see the Selected Issues Papers for the 2004 Article IV
Consultation (IMF Country Report No. 04/359; 11/12/2004).
6

Banks’ direct exposure to exchange and interest rate fluctuations is limited, since their open positions are small
and their lending rates are generally linked to the money market interest rate. Regarding the latter, however,
increases in interest rates could have negative effects on the corporate sector, and hence the quality of banks’
loan portfolios.

7

Stress tests from the 2006 FSAP update estimate the cost of ensuring sufficient capitalization in public banks
at around 2 percent of GDP under the most severe scenario, i.e. if: (a) performing loans become NPLs
(provisioned at 70 percent) at the same rate as during 2001-2003; and (b) there is a 50 percent write-off of NPLs
backed by real estate collateral. Meanwhile, the fiscal sustainability analysis shows the public debt declining
significantly in the medium term even if the government assumes a 10 percent of GDP contingent debt (see
Figure 6 below).

8

See Tunisia’s Financial System Stability Assessment (IMF Country Report No. 02/119; 6/17/2002), and the
2006 FSAP update, forthcoming.

II. POLICY DISCUSSIONS
5.
The policy discussions focused on short and medium-term policies to reduce the
external debt and address banking sector weaknesses, with a view to create proper
conditions for higher growth. Regarding the banking sector, the overriding issue is to sharpen
the strategy to tackle high NPLs, in the short term by cleaning up the existing stock of longstanding NPLs and, going forward, by promoting sound credit policies. Concerning external
debt, the key short-term issue is the utilization of privatization receipts, while continued
fiscal consolidation will dictate the medium-term success.
A. Short-Term outlook and Macroeconomic Policy Challenges
6.
The Tunisian economy continues to show strength and resilience to shocks. Real
GDP growth remained respectable in 2005 (4¼ percent), while the external current account
deficit narrowed to about 1.3 percent of GDP (from 2 percent the year before),
notwithstanding unfavorable agricultural conditions, the expiration of the Agreement on
Textiles and Clothing (ATC), and continued tepid demand in Europe, Tunisia’s main trading
partner. The sharp increase in oil prices had little effect on the balance of payments, since
Tunisia’s oil exports broadly match imports. International reserves continue to increase, now
covering more than 3¾ months of imports of goods and services. Growth should accelerate
to about 5¾ percent in 2006, with the return to normal agricultural production levels and
continued strength in services and industrial production. The external current account
balance is projected to remain broadly unchanged. The external debt-to-GDP ratio should
decline considerably in 2006, given the projected strong growth and assuming that part of

- 10 -

expected substantial privatization receipts is used to reduce the external debt burden. At the
same time, international reserves accumulation will likely accelerate both due to the
privatization proceeds and continued strong other private inflows.
7.
Increased external inflows present a challenge to monetary and exchange rate
policies. The BCT has so far aptly sterilized part of the excess liquidity generated by these
inflows,9 with broad money growing 10¾ percent in 2005. This has left inflation subdued,
while permitting credit to the economy to grow in line with economic activity. The
authorities agreed that these efforts need to continue, and perhaps be stepped up in view of
any excess liquidity generated by foreign financial inflows. However, in the event that
these inflows persist, it will be essential to accompany monetary policy with a more
ambitious fiscal consolidation plan, additional external debt repayments, and accelerated
trade liberalization. Furthermore, it is important to provide more scope for market forces to
determine the exchange rate and allow increased flexibility in both directions. In this
regard, the real effective exchange rate continued to depreciate in 2005 (by 4½ percent on
average). Although there are no obvious signs of an exchange rate misalignment (Box 3)
and the depreciation has not created inflationary pressures so far, the BCT will continue to
closely monitor developments in this area.
8.
Fiscal consolidation remains broadly on track, despite the sharp increase in oil
prices in 2005. To limit the impact on petroleum consumption subsidies, the authorities
continued to raise retail prices by a cumulative 15 percent in 2005 and the 2006 budget law
envisages further increases. In addition, the authorities took measures to contain other
spending in 2005, and tax revenue collection increased by ½ percentage point of GDP,
despite the secular decline in trade taxes. Nevertheless, wage increases and net new hiring
did result in a slight increase in the wage bill relative to GDP. All told, the central
government deficit widened somewhat in 2005, to 3.2 percent of GDP (excluding grants
and privatization receipts), but the public debt-to-GDP ratio declined by about ¾
percentage points to 59 percent. The 2006 budget law, based on an oil price assumption of
$60 per barrel, implies a ½ percentage point of GDP increase in the deficit. However, the
authorities considered a deficit below 3 percent of GDP feasible, even without additional
expenditure cuts, because the revenue projections in the 2006 budget law – implying a
substantial drop in tax buoyancy – appear conservative. This lower deficit would help
achieve their medium-term objective of bringing the public debt-to-GDP ratio below
50 percent. Concerning the financing of the deficit in 2006, the authorities intended to keep
domestic bonds the principal source, notwithstanding substantial privatization revenues, in
order not to complicate monetary management.

9

The BCT withdrew the equivalent of about 1 percent of broad money through open market operations in the
second half of 2005.

- 11 -

Box 3. Tunisia: Long-Term Trend in the Real Effective Exchange Rate
There is no clear evidence of a significant misalignment of the dinar. Although an econometric analysis suggests that the
depreciation of the REER in recent years has resulted in an undervaluation of the dinar, this conclusion is not statistically
significant (Box Figure 1).1 Moreover, the model does not take into account ongoing trade liberalization efforts in Tunisia,
notably in the context of the AAEU, likely to translate into a depreciation of the equilibrium REER. The currency appears
competitive, however, as seen by the gain in export market share since the early 1990s.

The partial privatization of Tunisie Télécom in 2006 dominates the short-term
outlook and has major implications for macroeconomic management. The operation,
valued at $2.3 billion (7½ percent of GDP), is Tunisia’s largest privatization to date.10 The
discussions highlighted the need to quickly establish a clear strategy for the use of the
proceeds from this privatization, so as to maximize their benefits for the Tunisian
economy, while limiting their impact on monetary aggregates. In this regard, the authorities
considered taking advantage of this opportunity to significantly reduce external debt.
However, they noted that, following efforts over recent years to retire expensive external
debt, the scope for further debt pre-payment was limited without incurring penalties or high
refinancing costs. Moreover, they noted that while Tunisia’s external reserves have reached
a comfortable level, they remain lower than those of many comparable emerging market
economies. Hence, the trade-off between reducing external debt and increasing reserves
needs to be carefully weighed.
10.
Banking sector indicators improved in 2005. The share of NPLs in total loans
declined by 2¾ percentage points, to about 21 percent, helped by the strong performance in
the tourism sector. Provisioning increased by ¾ percentage points, to 46½ percent, in part
reflecting stricter implementation of provisioning rules by the BCT. The authorities noted
that ongoing efforts to further improve collection and provisioning of NPLs should provide
significant results in 2006, especially in light of the favorable economic outlook.
B. Medium-Term Strategy to Accelerate Growth and Structural Change
11.
The remainder of the policy discussions focused on the authorities’ efforts to
strengthen the economy’s growth potential and capacity to absorb a growing supply
of skilled labor. The authorities are convinced that achieving these goals will require a
continued transformation of the Tunisian economy, founded on higher private investment
and accelerated productivity growth (see box 4 for the main medium-term assumptions). In
addition, it will be crucial to reduce Tunisia’s two main vulnerabilities, i.e. the high
external debt and banking sector weaknesses. In this context, the following priority areas
were emphasized: (a) financial sector reform; (b) strengthening macroeconomic policies;
and (c) improving the business climate and enhancing labor market flexibility.

10

The winning bid (3.05 billion dinars) was presented in March 2006. The macroeconomic framework
assumes full payment in 2006, with all funds raised abroad.

- 13 -

Box 4. Tunisia: 2006–11 Macroeconomic Framework
The medium-term macroeconomic framework projects an average annual real GDP growth of
6 ¼ percent over 2006–11, consistent with a continued significant decline in unemployment. This
growth objective would require an increase in private investment of about 1 percentage points of GDP
over the medium term and a ½ percentage point increase in average annual total factor productivity
growth compared to the past five years.
The external current account deficit is projected to narrow slightly from the current 1.3 percent
of GDP. Underlying this projection are the following main assumptions: (a) an average annual real
non-oil export growth of about 4½ percent, somewhat outpaced by imports as domestic demand picks
up; (b) sustained growth in tourism receipts; and (c) a decline in non-fuel commodity import prices
over the medium term after a sharp increase in 2006 (following the latest WEO assumptions).
Net external borrowing is assumed to decline sharply in 2006 and resume its previous trend
thereafter. The main underlying assumption is that the government uses some of its privatization
receipts to reduce the external debt burden. This would allow the total external debt-to-GDP ratio to
decline from 68 percent in 2005 to 50 percent in 2011, while official reserves would increase
substantially, from 3¾ months of imports of goods and non-factor services in 2005 to over 5½ months
in 2011.
The central government deficit is projected to fall from 3.2 percent of GDP in 2005 to 1.8 percent
in 2011 (excluding grants and privatization receipts). As a result, the consolidated government debt
would fall from 59 percent of GDP at end-2005 to 45 percent at end-2011.
The main risks to this scenario are (a) a delayed impact of the expiration of the ATC as temporary
countervailing measures disappear; (b) absence of a recovery in Europe, Tunisia’s main trading
partner; (c) negative effects of sustained high oil prices on domestic demand; (d) new shocks to the
tourism sector. Furthermore, the outcome of this scenario hinges critically on efforts by the authorities
to accelerate structural reforms and further strengthen macroeconomic policies.

Financial sector reform
12.
The authorities believe that tackling financial sector weaknesses is perhaps the
most pressing reform priority, to reduce vulnerabilities and improve growth
prospects. The recent FSAP update mission maintained the view that although banking
sector weaknesses are not of immediate systemic proportions, they constitute a drag on
growth by contributing to higher costs of capital and inefficient allocation of resources.
Moreover, there are no reasonable prospects of integrating the Tunisian financial sector
internationally without first remedying these weaknesses, especially the high level of
NPLs.
13.
The authorities have adopted a number of measures recently, aimed at
improving the credit culture, promoting good governance, and strengthening the legal
framework for banks. Some banks distributed little or no dividends in 2005, as a result of
the recent ban on such distributions for banks with insufficient provisioning. The authorities

- 14 -

consider this ban a powerful tool to create the right incentives for banks to improve their
credit appraisal methods. In addition, provisioning was made fully tax deductible in 2005.
Legal procedures to realize collateral through court-ordered sales have also been streamlined.
A new law on financial security was enacted in 2005, aimed at guaranteeing the transparency
and reliability of accounting. This law obligates companies of a certain size and
characteristics to appoint external auditors, and tightens financial reporting requirements. A
new draft amendment to the banking law should improve governance by expanding the
authority of banks’ Boards of Directors and requiring the establishment of an executive
credit committee answerable to it. In addition, the sale of the government’s remaining shares
in Banque du Sud was finalized. Regarding supervision, the FSAP update Basle Core
Principle assessment noted significant improvements since the 2002 FSAP. Regarding the
law against money laundering and financing of terrorism, the FSAP update noted that
customer due diligence and supervision and filing of suspicious transaction reports require
strengthening.
Box 5. Tunisia: Main NPL-related Recommendations of the 2006 FSAP Update
•

Require 70 percent provisioning for all NPLs, regardless of existing collateral;

•

Reduce by 2009 the NPL ratio to 10 percent through a proactive policy of loan restructuring,
including partial write-offs, accompanied by measures to avoid moral hazard;

•

Develop a strategy for restructuring NPLs to the tourism sector, on the basis of a realistic
assessment of debt repayment capacity of borrowers;

•

Reduce delays in judicial proceedings and increase reliance on out-of-court settlements;

•

Allow full tax deductibility for partial write-offs;

•

Strengthen management of public commercial banks and consider privatization and mergers of
former development banks;

•

Promote establishment of private credit bureaus.

14.
While the mission was encouraged by recent progress, it suggested that the gradual
reform strategy followed so far by the authorities may need to make way for a more forceful
approach. The quality of banks’ credit portfolios is highly vulnerable to economic
downturns, as shown by the steep increase in NPLs in 2003 following shocks to the tourism
sector. To accelerate the resolution of the NPL problem, the staff suggested:
(a) strengthening public bank management, to ensure better governance and operation on a
commercial basis; (b) ensuring strict application of provisioning rules and sanctions; and
(c) taking stronger measures to deal with the existing stock of NPLs, through write-offs and
credit restructuring based on the ongoing study by the BCT on longstanding NPLs.
Regarding the latter, the FSAP update mission favored adopting an explicit target for NPLs
(reducing the ratio to 10 percent by 2009, see box 5), to free resources for new lending. In
this context, debt workouts will increasingly need to rely on out-of-court settlement, to limit
judicial delays. While broadly agreeing, the authorities noted that most of the key
recommendations of the 2002 FSAP have been implemented and that more time is needed to

- 15 -

assess their impact before reconsidering the current strategy. They intend to focus on
bringing the provisioning ratio up to 70 percent, while targeting an explicit NPL ratio of
15 percent in 2009 and 12 percent in 2011. The staff also suggested considering
recapitalizing public banks with sizeable impaired loan portfolios, once management has
been strengthened and safeguards have been put in place to avoid new accumulation of
NPLs. However, the authorities were reluctant to this idea, due to moral hazard concerns.
Instead, they emphasized the need to enforce collection of NPLs, to avoid condoning bad
behavior.
Strengthening Macroeconomic Policies
15.
To maximize the benefits of Tunisia’s global and regional integration, while
containing risks, the authorities and the Fund are collaborating to strengthen
macroeconomic policies. A key component of this strategy is to gradually liberalize external
capital flows. The authorities agree that, in addition to significant improvements in the
banking sector, this strategy needs to be supported by a move to a floating exchange rate, a
strengthened monetary policy framework, deeper and more modern money and exchange
markets, a solid fiscal position, and lower external debt.
External Capital Account Liberalization
16.
The authorities pressed ahead in 2005 with their gradual liberalization of
external capital flows.11 Notably, further scope was given to nonresidents to participate in
the local Treasury bill market; borrowing abroad was fully liberalized for rated financial
institutions and restrictions were eased on rated nonfinancial institutions; and authorizations
were abolished on most foreign acquisitions of securities carrying voting rights in Tunisian
companies. The first of three phases in the capital liberalization strategy developed in
collaboration with Fund staff is hence close to completion, save for some remaining
restrictions on inward FDI. Abolishing those restrictions will not only contribute to
enhancing knowledge transfers from abroad, but it will also allow FDI to play a more
prominent role in financing Tunisia’s current account deficit. The next phase, involving
liberalization of Tunisian investment abroad and full liberalization of inward portfolio
investment, can be completed only once the financial sector is modernized and strengthened,
a floating exchange rate regime has been adopted, and the new monetary policy framework is
firmly in place.

11

See also the Selected Issues Paper “Tunisia: Potential Growth-Enhancing Effects of Further Capital Account
Liberalization and Supporting Reforms”, forthcoming. The paper suggests that capital account liberalization can
contribute to promote growth and FDI.

- 16 -

Monetary and Exchange Rate Policy
17.
The BCT has made significant progress toward implementing the new broad
money targeting framework, with base money as the operating target. This framework,
an intermediate step toward inflation targeting, has been run in parallel for the past year
with the existing framework, which focuses on maintaining private credit growth in line
with nominal GDP growth. The objective of implementing inflation targeting in the future
has taken on increased significance with the new draft Central Bank law, which defines
price stability as the key objective of the BCT.
18.
However, substantial progress toward a floating exchange rate supported by
inflation targeting requires deeper money and exchange markets. In this context, it is
necessary that the Treasury remain present along a wide maturity range, to deepen the
money market and build a full yield curve. Accordingly, issuance of short-term Treasury
bills resumed in March 2005, although it was again discontinued in October. In addition, the
elimination of the ceiling for BCT purchases of Treasury bills in the new central bank law
will facilitate building a securities portfolio for monetary policy operations, which should
help develop the secondary market for such securities. Furthermore, the BCT has reduced its
role as provider of liquidity, allowing the volume of transactions on the interbank market to
increase significantly. Moreover, surrender requirements on foreign exchange receipts were
eliminated in 2005, which should contribute to deepening the foreign exchange market.
However, the authorities agree that the requirement that banks transfer end-of-day foreign
exchange balances to the BCT (nivellement) and the BCT’s practice of quoting daily
exchange rates remain the main obstacles for foreign exchange market development.
Accordingly, they are preparing to eliminate the nivellement and they are considering
quoting exchange rates only ex post. Staff further emphasized the importance for market
development of allowing greater exchange and interest rate flexibility, and eliminating
restrictions on forward operations and foreign exchange options. This would provide market
incentives for developing the appropriate hedging instruments and facilitate the transition to
a floating exchange rate and a more dynamic monetary policy.
Fiscal Reform
19.
Although the fiscal position is sustainable and steadily improving, the authorities
recognize the need to accelerate fiscal reform. They appropriately aim at bringing public debt
below 50 percent of GDP in the medium term, from the current level of 59 percent. Fiscal
consolidation would advance two main goals: (a) reducing the external debt; and (b)
enhancing flexibility in fiscal policy. An auxiliary objective is to facilitate monetary and
exchange rate policy reform by cementing low inflation expectations and eliminating any
potential fiscal considerations from the central bank’s interest rate decision process. The

- 17 -

standard public debt sustainability analysis shows that vulnerabilities are limited, except to
currency fluctuations. The latter reflects the high share of public debt owed to foreigners.

The authorities plan to step up ongoing efforts to improve tax collection. Tax
buoyancy has proven somewhat fickle in the recent past and is destined to weaken in the
future, short of reforms. The increasing share of less-taxed sectors (mainly for exports),
falling profit transfers from soon-to-be privatized public enterprises, and decreasing customs
revenues all constitute fiscal challenges. Tunisia received technical assistance from the
Fund’s Fiscal Affairs Department in 2005, advising it to simplify tax legislation, limit tax
exemptions, and modernize tax administration. Accordingly, the authorities presented plans
to: (a) expand the corporate income tax base, while reducing its rate; (b) simplify the VAT
by reducing the number of rates; (c) revise tax incentives, especially for off-shore activities;
and (d) reorganize the tax administration and increase computerization to enhance
effectiveness and improve services to tax payers. Furthermore, they plan to eliminate limits
on reimbursements of VAT credits, which should reduce distortions and improve the
relations between tax authorities and the private sector. Nevertheless, other remaining tax
rules, such as VAT withholdings at the source, undermine efficiency by breaking the chain
of the VAT and by weakening the basic principle of self-assessment. While the authorities
are aware of these issues, they see some value in these type of measures to limit tax
delinquency and fraud.

- 18 -

21.
On the expenditure side, key reforms are under way to limit the fiscal costs of
energy subsidies, although the wage bill will remain high in the medium term. The
authorities indicated that they are planning to phase out petroleum consumption subsidies
and fully liberalize retail prices in the coming years. Meanwhile, they are in the process of
implementing a comprehensive strategy for more efficient use of energy, which should
alleviate the impact of potentially higher retail prices on households and firms. Regarding
the wage bill (12 percent of GDP), the authorities indicated that the scope for reduction is
limited over the medium term because: (a) health and education personnel account for a
large share of outlays and investment in human capital has been crucial for Tunisia’s
economic performance; and (b) efforts to upgrade the quality of the civil service necessitate
hiring more qualified, higher paid, personnel.
Business Climate and Labor Market Flexibility
22.
The authorities are convinced that a more dynamic private sector is essential
for moving Tunisia to a higher growth path within an increasingly globalized economy.
In this context, it is key to improve the business climate to increase the level and quality of
private investment, including FDI. Accelerating multilateral trade liberalization and
continuing the customs reform would contribute to reduce firms’ cost of production. In this
regard, the ongoing streamlining of customs procedures through computerization, selectivity
in customs inspections, and simplification of administrative procedures are positive
developments, as are the plans to modernize the customs code. Furthermore, the ongoing
process of simplifying administrative procedures for businesses is commendable and should
be intensified.
23.
There is a need to further enhance labor market flexibility to facilitate labor
reallocation in response to structural changes in the economy.12 Increased flexibility
would encourage the creation of skilled jobs, thereby improving productivity. It would also
contribute to reducing the impact of the expiration of the ATC on employment in the
medium term. The authorities share these concerns and have taken measures to enhance
labor market flexibility at the recruitment level (temporary jobs). However, the mission
argued that increasing hiring flexibility without relaxing the complex dismissal rules could
hamper the creation of permanent jobs. Recent staff analysis indicates that the decline in
unemployment over the past years has coincided with less frictions in the labor market,
although some of this gain has been offset by a decline in private investment relative to
GDP.13
12

The issue of labor market rigidities was analyzed in the Selected Issues Papers for the 2004 Article IV (IMF
Country Report No. 04/359; 11/12/2004) and WP/05/92.
13

See the Selected Issues Paper “Business Cycle Accounting in Tunisia”, forthcoming.

- 19 -

C. Other Issues
24.
Tunisia cooperates with neighboring countries to enhance economic integration
in the Maghreb region. This initiative was initiated by a conference on trade facilitation
among Algeria, Morocco and Tunisia in 2005.
25.
A mission for a new Report on the Observance of Standards and Codes
(ROSC)—Data Module was conducted in 2005. Tunisia has subscribed to the Special
Data Dissemination Standard (SDDS) since 2001. Tunisia is also part of a pilot project on
the transition to the Government Financial Statistics Manual 2001.
III. STAFF APPRAISAL
26.
Tunisia’s strong economic performance and resilience to adverse shocks show
the benefits of sustained sound macroeconomic policies and market-oriented reforms.
Tunisia has made strides toward its goal of approaching lower OECD per-capita income
levels, but the gap remains substantial, leaving no room for complacency. In fact, at this
juncture, losing economic reform momentum could put Tunisia’s significant achievements
at risk, as increased global competition requires increased flexibility on both the
macroeconomic and structural fronts. Two remaining vulnerabilities – a high level of
external debt and banking sector weaknesses – may jeopardize the reform strategy. Strong
macroeconomic conditions and the favorable outlook present a window of opportunity to
advance the reform agenda and address these vulnerabilities.
27.
Monetary and exchange rate policies have so far dealt effectively with increased
external inflows. As a result, inflation has remained subdued and the dinar appears
appropriately valued. However, these inflows may intensify in the future, not only because
of substantial privatization proceeds but also due to increased market confidence in
Tunisia’s economic performance more broadly. In that event, sterilization by the BCT may
not be sufficient and will need to be complemented by fiscal tightening, accelerated trade
liberalization, and increased exchange rate flexibility. It is encouraging that the authorities
are considering using part of the coming privatization proceeds to repay external debt.
Devoting a substantial part of these proceeds for this purpose will facilitate monetary
management, reduce external-debt vulnerabilities, and strengthen the fiscal position.
28.
The authorities should be commended for not allowing the steep rise in
international oil prices to derail fiscal consolidation. Bringing the fiscal deficit below
3 percent of GDP appears within reach in 2006, particularly if the authorities continue their
policy of gradually reducing subsidies on petroleum products. This would help achieve the

- 20 -

authorities’ medium-term public debt-reduction target. Were fiscal pressures from high oil
prices to ease, the authorities should seize the opportunity to further reduce the deficit.
29.
Banking sector vulnerabilities constitute a drag on growth and an obstacle
toward macroeconomic policy reform. It is encouraging that the authorities have put in
place most of the key recommendations of the 2002 FSAP and that they have sharpened
their strategy to reduce the burden of NPLs in the context of the 2006 FSAP update. The
measures taken by the authorities are already yielding results as shown by the decline in the
NPL ratio and the increased provisioning in 2005. The favorable economic outlook augurs
well for a further reduction in 2006, but efforts need to be stepped up to ensure a substantial
improvement in banks’ portfolio over the next three-year horizon.
30.
The authorities medium-term macroeconomic reform program has progressed
well, with focus on: (a) gradually liberalizing the external capital account; (b) establishing a
new broad-money targeting framework as an intermediate step toward inflation targeting;
and (c) broad fiscal reform.
31.
The first phase of the authorities’ plan for external capital account
liberalization has almost been completed, but further substantial progress needs to wait
for improved banking sector conditions. In this regard, the authorities need to monitor the
potential emergence of new risks and adapt supervision accordingly. The benefits from fully
integrating Tunisia in international financial markets may be substantial in term of access to
foreign saving, portfolio diversification, increased foreign direct investment, and improved
efficiency of the financial markets.
32.
The implementation of the new broad money targeting framework should help
to deepen the money market by allowing more interest rate flexibility and improve the
monetary policy transmission mechanism, necessary conditions for eventually adopting
inflation targeting. The new central bank law will constitute a significant step toward
clarifying the monetary policy objective, strengthening central bank independence, and
providing instruments for the conduct of monetary policy.
33.
The progress in capital account liberalization and elimination of the surrender
requirements should translate into a deeper foreign exchange market, needed to
eventually float the dinar. However, the nivellement still constitutes a significant obstacle to
market development that should be removed as soon as possible. Greater two-way exchange
rate flexibility would also favor a deepening of the market.
34.
On the fiscal side, determined implementation of the authorities’ tax reform plans is
essential not only to improve tax buoyancy, but also to improve the business climate by

- 21 -

simplifying regulations and limiting the scope for discretion in the relation with tax payers.
Fiscal consolidation will, however, also require curbing expenditure growth. In this sense
the authorities’ intention to gradually phase out subsidies on petroleum products and
eventually fully liberalize their price is welcome. Over the medium term, action will also be
needed to reduce the weight of the wage bill, which constitutes a significant fiscal rigidity.
35.
Increased momentum in structural reforms is essential to create a businessfriendly environment, to raise productivity and private investment, and bring Tunisia to a
higher-growth path. Priority areas are trade and labor market liberalization.
36.
Tunisia has substantially opened up to foreign trade in the context of the
association agreement with the EU. Multilateral and regional trade liberalization needs to
complement the bilateral dimension to fully reap the benefits of broad and more integrated
markets. It is encouraging that the authorities plan to streamline customs procedures and the
mission welcomes the authorities’ interest in Fund technical assistance in this area.
Tunisia’s active participation in efforts to increase economic integration in the Maghreb is
also commendable.
37.
Although declining, Tunisia’s unemployment rate remains unacceptably high,
particularly among the skilled segments of the labor force. Thus, there is a need to increase
the employment content of growth by continuing to liberalize the labor market. In this sense
the authorities should consider easing both hiring and firing restrictions.
38.
Staff commends the authorities for their continued commitment to
transparency of economic policies. Tunisia has published the concluding statements of
Fund missions and routinely publishes staff reports of Article IV consultations and FSAPs.
39.
It is proposed that the next Article IV consultation take place on the standard
12 month cycle.

Projections
2009 2010 2011

1/ Derived as [r - g - ρ(1+g) + εα(1+r)]/(1+g+ρ+gρ) times previous period debt stock, with r = nominal effective interest rate on external debt; ρ = change in domestic GDP deflator in US dollar terms, g = real GDP growth rate,
ε = nominal appreciation (increase in dollar value of domestic currency), and α = share of domestic-currency denominated debt in total external debt.
2/ The contribution from price and exchange rate changes is defined as [-ρ(1+g) + εα(1+r)]/(1+g+ρ+gρ) times previous period debt stock. ρ increases with an appreciating domestic currency (ε > 0) and rising inflation (based on GDP deflator).
3/ For projection, line includes the impact of price and exchange rate changes. The volatility of the residual is exaggerated by the calculation of the exchange rate effect, which assumes that all foreign debt is denominated in U.S. dollars.
This effect is particularly pronounced in 2003 when the Tunisian dinar appreciated against the U.S. dollar, while depreciating against all other major currencies.
4/ Defined as current account deficit, plus amortization on medium- and long-term debt, plus short-term debt at end of previous period.
5/ The key variables include real GDP growth; nominal interest rate; dollar deflator growth; and both non-interest current account and non-debt inflows in percent of GDP.
6/ Long-run, constant balance that stabilizes the debt ratio assuming that key variables (real GDP growth, nominal interest rate, dollar deflator growth, and non-debt inflows in percent of GDP) remain at their levels
of the last projection year.

Real GDP growth (in percent)
GDP deflator in US dollars (change in percent)
Nominal external interest rate (in percent)
Growth of exports (US dollar terms, in percent)
Growth of imports (US dollar terms, in percent)

1/ Indicate coverage of public sector, e.g., general government or nonfinancial public sector. Also whether net or gross debt is used.
2/ Derived as [(r - π(1+g) - g + αε(1+r)]/(1+g+π+gπ)) times previous period debt ratio, with r = interest rate; π = growth rate of GDP deflator; g = real GDP growth rate; α = share of foreign-currency
denominated debt; and ε = nominal exchange rate depreciation (measured by increase in local currency value of U.S. dollar).
3/ The real interest rate contribution is derived from the denominator in footnote 2/ as r - π (1+g) and the real growth contribution as -g.
4/ The exchange rate contribution is derived from the numerator in footnote 2/ as αε(1+r).
5/ The volatility of the residual is exaggerated by the calculation of the exchange rate effect, which assumes that all foreign debt is denominated in U.S. dollars. This effect is particularly
pronounced in 2003 when the Tunisian dinar appreciated against the U.S. dollar, while depreciating against all other major currencies.
6/ Defined as public sector deficit, plus amortization of medium and long-term public sector debt, plus short-term debt at end of previous period.
7/ The key variables include real GDP growth; real interest rate; and primary balance in percent of GDP.
8/ Derived as nominal interest expenditure divided by previous period debt stock.
9/ Assumes that key variables (real GDP growth, real interest rate, and other identified debt-creating flows) remain at the level of the last projection year.

APPENDIX I

Exchange Rate Arrangement and Exchange System
Tunisia accepted the obligations of Article VIII Sections 2(a),3, and 4 effective
January 6, 1993 and maintains an exchange system that is free of restrictions on the making
of payments and transfers on current international transactions, except that Tunisia maintains
(a) a multiple currency practice resulting from honoring exchange rate guarantees extended
prior to August 1988 to development banks, which will automatically expire after the
existing commitments have matured; and (b) certain restrictions relating to Iraq and the
Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (Serbia and Montenegro), pursuant to UN Security Council
Resolutions. These are subject to notification to the Fund in accordance with Decision 144
(52/51).
Since March 1, 1994, the market rates are determined in an interbank foreign exchange
market. On April 20, 2006, the interbank rate of the dinar vis-à-vis the U.S. dollar was
US$1=TD 1.3360, equivalent to SDR 1=TD 1.943.
Article IV Consultation
Tunisia is on the 12-month cycle. The last discussions of the Article IV consultation were
held in Tunis from June 16 to July 1, 2004 and the consultation was concluded by the
Executive Board on October 27, 2004.

APPENDIX II

TUNISIA: FINANCIAL RELATIONS WITH THE WORLD BANK
(As of March 31, 2006)
1.
The World Bank’s portfolio in Tunisia has a total of 16 active operations and 117
closed loans, of which 10 International Development Agency (IDA) credits amounting to
US$75.2 million net of cancellations. Cumulative net commitments represent US$5.1 billion.
Of this total, US$3.4 billion has been repaid. Net commitments for the 16 current investment
operations amount to about US$0.8 billion.
2.
A new Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) was approved by the Board on
June 3, 2004. It proposes to assist the Government of Tunisia in addressing three key
challenges: (a) strengthen the business environment to support the development of a more
competitive, internationally integrated private sector and improve competitiveness of the
Tunisian economy; (b) enhance skills and employability of graduates and labor force in a
knowledge economy; and (c) improve the quality of social services through enhanced
efficiency of public expenditures.
3.
Bank lending is a mix of long-term investments in infrastructure and social sector
financing, and development policy lending to support reforms at the sector and
macroeconomic levels. Recent loans include an Urban Water Supply project ($38.0 million)
approved by the Board on November 17, 2005, and a development policy loan – ECAL IV
($150.0 million) approved by the Board on June 9, 2005. One GEF , Tunisia Africa Stockpile
Programme ($4.0 million) was also approved on September 8, 2005.
4.
Preparation is ongoing for the following projects: Second Higher Education Reform
Support ($140.0 million) scheduled for Board consideration in June 2006; Tunis West
Sewerage ($60.0 million); and Sustainable Management of Municipal Waste ($20.0 million),
both scheduled for FY07 Board approval. This latter project is the first of its kind in Tunisia
which will incorporate, as part of a Bank investment project, a component on carbon
emission reduction and provide Bank assistance in accessing the emerging global market of
carbon finance under the Clean Development Mechanism of the Kyoto Protocol.
5.
Despite the fact that the quality of the portfolio is satisfactory, cumbersome
procurement procedures and slow implementation pace - especially in the rural development
portfolio - are affecting the portfolio performance. A Country Portfolio Performance Review
(CPPR) was carried out in May 2005 with special focus on procurement issues. An action
plan was designed to address the key constraints identified and is being implemented jointly
by the Bank and counterpart teams.
6.
Recent analytical work includes studies of employment challenges, poverty trends,
private participation in infrastructure, public debt management, and tourism. A Development
Policy Review was prepared in 2003 in order to assess Tunisia’s key challenges and policy
priorities in the years ahead. This provided the analytical basis for the new Country
Assistance Strategy and is intended to inform the Government’s thinking on the next five-

- 35 APPENDIX II

year plan (2007–2011). Other recent work includes Country Financial Accountability and
Procurement Assessments, a Report on the Observance of Standards and Codes (ROSC),
audit and accounting module, and analytical work in specific sectors such as education,
health and agriculture. An update of the Financial Sector Assessment Program (FSAP)
conducted jointly with the IMF has just been completed. A strategy on education and training
and an investment climate assessment (ICA) are ongoing. Three sub-regional Maghreb
studies (covering Tunisia, Morocco and Algeria) are ongoing. These studies focus on: (i) the
textiles and clothing sector and the impact of MFA dismantling; (ii) economic
diversification; and (iii) a sub-regional study on Maghreb regional economic integration and
on the link between policy reforms in the service sectors and economic performance in the
region. Future work will include a study on service liberalization and export competitiveness.
7.
In addition, the World Bank is providing technical assistance on a regular basis on
issues such as public debt management, performance-based budgeting, the promotion of the
knowledge-based economy and productivity analysis. The Bank also provides multi-year
support on employment and labor market issues as part of a Programmatic Economic and
Sector Work.

APPENDIX III

TUNISIA: STATISTICAL ISSUES
1.
Overall, available economic and financial data are adequate for surveillance and have
generally been provided to the Fund on a regular and timely basis. Most of those data are
also made available to the wider public. Tunisia subscribed to the SDDS in June 2001 and its
metadata are posted on the Dissemination Standards Bulletin Board (DSBB). A data ROSC
is under preparation, following a mission that took place in April 2005.
Real Sector
2.
IFS coverage of data on real sector developments is satisfactory and most data are
reported in a timely manner, although export and import price and volume indices are
reported with a long lag. Data on employment, unemployment, and wages should be
collected and reported on a more frequent basis.
3.
Data on GDP by economic sector are disseminated at current and constant prices.
Although the System of National Accounts 1968 (1968 SNA) is broadly followed, significant
conceptual elements of the System of National Accounts 1993 (1993 SNA) have been
implemented (including institutional sector accounts and estimates of the unrecorded
economy). Work is underway toward full adoption of the 1993 SNA. Statistical techniques
are adequate for the annual accounts but need some refinement for the quarterly estimates.
Source data for the quarterly national accounts could be further diversified to improve
coverage. Currently, an outdated base year (1990) is used for the constant price series. A new
series using 2000 as base year is expected to be released in the near future
Government Finance
4.
In addition to the information reported in the SDDS, government finance data are
collected by the staff at the time of the Article IV consultation mission. Regarding data for
publication, GFS cash data up to 2005 have been published in the Government Finance
Statistics Yearbook 2005. Data cover budgetary central government and consolidated central
government. Tunisia does not report monthly or quarterly data for publication in IFS.
Balance of Payments
5.
Statistics for balance of payments (BOP) and international investment position (IIP)
are compiled by the Central Bank of Tunisia (CBT), following the methodology of the fifth
edition of the Balance of Payments Manual, (BPM5). The BOP statistics are prepared on a
quarterly basis and the IIP on an annual basis, complying with SDDS requirements.
However, Tunisia does not report quarterly data for redissemination in IMF publications. The

- 38 -

APPENDIX III

CBT issues preliminary monthly statistics, mostly prepared on the basis of banks’
settlements with nonresidents. BOP statistics are generally adequate for annual surveillance,
although greater detail on the financial account would be desirable. However, the recent
ROSC mission noted that remittances of Tunisian workers abroad are classified as income
instead of current transfers, and that reinvested earnings of foreign direct investments are not
recorded in the balance of payments. As an SDDS subscriber, Tunisia reports reserves data
following the International Reserves and Foreign Currency Liquidity—Operational
Guidelines (Reserves Template) since June 2001.
Monetary and Financial Statistics
6.
Monetary statistics compiled by the CBT are broadly based on the 1984 Guide to
Money and Banking Statistics in International Financial Statistics. Tunisia’s monetary
statistics meet SDDS requirements. However, there is room for improvement. For example,
banks’ claims on the rest of domestic sector (other than central government and financial
corporations) are not fully sectorized; monetary gold is valued at a fixed price; and accrued
interest on deposits is not included in the outstanding value of these deposits. The CBT has
initiated a plan to migrate to the methodology recommended in the Monetary and Financial
Statistics Manual (2000).

Article IV Consultation Discussion

Early 2007.

Statement by the IMF Staff Representative on Tunisia
May 24, 2006
This statement provides information on developments since the issuance of the staff report,
and does not change the thrust of the staff appraisal. The Tunisian authorities recently
announced that (a) the banking law amendment has been promulgated and the new central
bank law has been passed by parliament; and (b) consistent with Fund advice, they intend to
use two-thirds of the proceeds from the partial privatization of Tunisie Télécom ($2.3 billion)
to retire external debt – substantially more than assumed in the staff report.
Impact on macroeconomic projections due to higher external debt repayment:
•

Total external debt projections shift downward by about 2-2½ percentage points
of GDP from 2007 onward (the bulk of the additional external debt repayment is
assumed to occur in 2007). Accordingly, the external debt-to-GDP ratio is projected
to decline from 68 percent in 2005 to 47½ percent in 2011.

•

Public debt projections shift downward by the same amount. Hence, the public
debt ratio falls from 59 percent of GDP in 2005 to 43 percent in 2011.

•

Projected international reserves are lower by an equivalent amount. The import
coverage (goods and non-factor services) stabilizes slightly above 5 months in the
medium term.

•

There is no appreciable effect on the central government’s deficit, nor on the
external current account. In fact, lower interest payments on public external debt
are broadly offset by lower earnings on international reserves.

•

There is no impact on key monetary aggregates, since the proceeds were anyway
assumed to be sterilized.

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2006 Article IV Consultation with
Tunisia
On May 24, 2006, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded the
Article IV consultation with Tunisia.1
Background
Over the past decade, market-oriented reforms and prudent macroeconomic policies have
contributed to placing Tunisia’s economic performance among the best in the region. The
authorities have managed the exchange rate flexibly in a context of restricted external capital
flows. Outward orientation has been a key component of Tunisia’s development strategy,
notably through an Association Agreement with the EU, signed in 1995. Gradual structural
reforms combined with a flexible exchange rate policy since 2000 have supported
competitiveness and export growth.
The Tunisian economy continues to show strength and the outlook is favorable. Real GDP
growth remained relatively strong in 2005 and the external current account deficit narrowed
significantly, notwithstanding unfavorable agricultural conditions, the expiration of the
Agreement on Textiles and Clothing, and continued tepid demand in Europe. Growth is
expected to accelerate in 2006, as agricultural production recovers and the service and
industry sectors remain strong. While increased financial inflows present a challenge for
monetary policy, the current macroeconomic stance remains appropriate and inflation
subdued.
1

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On
return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the
Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the
Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the
country's authorities.

-2The external debt-to-GDP ratio remained broadly unchanged in 2005, at 68 percent, but is
expected to decline substantially in 2006, owing to high growth and large privatization
proceeds.
The central government deficit widened somewhat in 2005 (to 3.2 percent of GDP, excluding
privatization receipts and grants) due to the impact of high oil prices on subsidies, but is
expected to return to about 3 percent in 2006. The authorities continue to raise retail petroleum
prices. On the revenue side, they are undertaking tax policy and administration reforms. The
medium-term objective is to bring public debt from 59 percent GDP to below 50 percent.
Banking sector indicators improved in 2005. The share of non-performing loans (NPLs) in total
loans declined significantly (to about 21 percent) and provisioning increased somewhat. While
not of systemic proportions, banking sector vulnerabilities increase the cost of capital and
hinder macroeconomic reform. The recent Financial Sector Assessment Program update
should contribute to sharpening the authorities’ reform strategy.
Over the medium term, the authorities are aiming to achieve the standard of living of emerging
market OECD countries and transform Tunisia’s economic structure to absorb the rapidly
increasing supply of skilled labor. This will require: (i) strengthening the financial sector by
accelerating the resolution of the high NPLs; (ii) advancing macroeconomic policy reforms; (iii)
improving the investment climate; and (iv) increasing labor market flexibility.
Tunisia continues to improve the quality and dissemination of statistical data and increase the
transparency of its economic policies. Tunisia has published all Executive Board documents
and staff mission statements in recent years and intend to publish the 2006 Article IV Staff
Report and Selected Issues papers.
Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors commended Tunisia’s strong economic performance and resilience to
adverse shocks, reflected in robust growth, subdued inflation, strengthened reserves, and
increasing capital inflows, which underscored the benefits of sustained sound macroeconomic
policies and market-oriented reforms. Directors stressed, however, that growth will need to
accelerate in order to meet Tunisia’s objective of reaching lower-tier OECD income levels and
reducing unemployment, and encouraged the authorities to speed up macroeconomic and
structural reforms, to take full advantage of global and regional integration.
Directors welcomed the authorities’ continued efforts to contain the fiscal impact of high oil
prices, including recent adjustments in retail petroleum prices, within the framework of a
comprehensive strategy for more efficient energy use. These measures, combined with
ongoing tax reforms and efforts to improve tax collection will support continued fiscal
consolidation and targeted reductions in public debt over the medium term. Nonetheless,
Directors viewed that the weight of the wage bill will need to be reduced over the medium-term
in order to enhance fiscal policy flexibility.
Directors noted that, faced with increased external capital inflows, monetary and exchange
rate policies had effectively contained inflation while maintaining strong growth. They

-3encouraged the authorities to remain vigilant against price pressures and, if needed,
complement monetary policy with fiscal tightening, accelerated trade liberalization, and
increased exchange rate flexibility, in particular, if capital inflows persist.
Directors welcomed the phased liberalization of the external capital account, and the
associated integration of Tunisia’s economy with international markets, and urged timely action
on the steps required for advancing to the next stages. They emphasized that the associated
transition to a floating exchange rate regime will need to be supported by a deepening of
money and exchange markets. In this regard, they were encouraged by the progress towards
the implementation of Tunisia’s new monetary policy framework and, in particular, by the new
central bank law and its focus on price stability as a key objective. Directors underscored the
importance of increased interest and exchange rate flexibility for market development. They
welcomed the authorities’ commitment to eliminate, in the near future, the requirement that
banks transfer end-of-day foreign exchange balances to the Central Bank of Tunisia, and
emphasized that improved banking sector conditions are prerequisite for sustaining further
substantial advancement.
Directors were encouraged that the authorities have put in place most of the key
recommendations of the 2002 FSAP and welcomed Tunisia’s participation in the 2006 FSAP
update, which will help in addressing the remaining weaknesses in the banking sector,
including by sharpening the strategy for reducing NPLs, and tackling vulnerabilities. In this
regard, they welcomed the authorities’ intention to publish a report on banking supervision and
financial stability. Given the favorable economic outlook, efforts to improve banking indicators
over the next three-year period should be stepped up, by increasing provisioning, improving
the quality of new credit, and dealing decisively with the existing stock of NPLs. They stressed
that public banks should be operated on a strictly commercial basis, and that provisioning rules
and sanctions should be fully enforced.
Directors welcomed the authorities’ decision to use most of the proceeds from the partial
privatization of Tunisie Télécom to retire external debt, which will facilitate monetary
management, contribute to reducing the high external debt, and strengthen the fiscal position.
Directors noted that accelerating structural reforms will be key to enhancing the economy’s
adaptability to a changing global environment and strengthening Tunisia’s attractiveness as a
destination for private investment. In this regard, improving the business climate and further
increasing labor market flexibility are priorities that would also help to address Tunisia’s high
unemployment, increasingly concentrated among university graduates. Directors, while
acknowledging that Tunisia has been a pioneer in the region’s trade integration vis-à-vis the
European Union, urged the intensification of multilateral and regional integration efforts. They
welcomed ongoing customs reforms, and the authorities’ interest in Fund technical assistance
in this area. Directors also lauded Tunisia’s active participation in efforts to increase economic
integration within the Maghreb region.
Directors welcomed the completion of the AML/CFT Report on the Observance of Standards
and Codes, and noted that the key challenge going forward will be to bring implementation,
enforcement, and supervision of financial sector compliance in line with AML/CFT

-4requirements. They commended the authorities’ commitment to transparency and welcomed
their continuous efforts to improve the quality of data.

Public Information Notices (PINs) are issued, (a) at the request of a member country, following the
conclusion of the Article IV consultation for countries seeking to make known the views of the IMF to the
public. This action is intended to strengthen IMF surveillance over the economic policies of member
countries by increasing the transparency of the IMF's assessment of these policies; and (b) following
policy discussions in the Executive Board at the decision of the Board.

Statement by Abbas Mirakhor, Executive Director for Tunisia
May 24, 2006

We thank staff for the well-written and concise report on the 2006 Article IV consultation,
supported by relevant background studies, and for the well-balanced FSSA update.
Additional documents, to be issued shortly, include AML/CFT and data ROSCs, and a
detailed assessment of observance of the Basel Core Principles. Our Tunisian authorities are
grateful for the effective Fund support received over the years and appreciate staff work and
policy advice as well as Directors’ contribution to the continuous strengthening of the
relations between the Fund and Tunisia.
As reflected in the staff report, Tunisia has achieved and maintained macroeconomic stability
and has built enough resilience in the economy to withstand various external shocks as
evinced in recent years. This resilience has been reflected, in 2005, in a further narrowing of
the current account deficit to 1.3 percent of GDP and in a minor increase in the budget deficit
to 3.2 percent of GDP despite the impact of high international oil prices. The authorities are
determined to sustain the hard-won stability gains and, in this regard, are implementing a
comprehensive energy strategy which, inter alia, includes increases in domestic petroleum
retail prices—already increased five times since 2005; proactive substitution policy to
encourage the use of alternative and renewable energy; introduction of a mandatory energy
audit in the industrial sector to promote efficiency; and extensive public awareness campaign
focused on the importance of energy conservation and the burden of energy subsidies on the
budget.
While macroeconomic stability will be preserved, the staff report correctly suggests that
accelerated reforms are needed to place the economy on a higher growth trajectory, in order
to reduce unemployment and raise per capita income to a high enough level, at least, to
bridge the existing gap with lower-tier OECD countries within a decade. As the staff report
suggests, the latter requires at least 1–1.5 percentage points higher growth rates than
achieved in recent years. Fully aware of this challenge, the authorities have developed a
medium-term growth strategy—well summarized in Box 2 of the staff report—which
focuses on a gradual liberalization of the capital account, in consultation with the Fund, as
detailed in the Selected Issues paper, and a private sector-oriented reform program
supported by the World Bank. The immediate challenges to a successful implementation of
this strategy, identified by the authorities and staff, are further reforming the banking sector
and improving debt indicators.
The authorities consider that a sound financial system is critical for the achievement of
higher economic growth and a prerequisite for smooth integration of the country into the
global economy. In recent years, financial sector reform was cast within the 2002 FSAP
recommendations, and Table 1 of the FSSA details progress in their implementation.

-2-

Furthermore, the 2006 amendments of the Banking and the Central Bank Laws, together
with the 2005 law on financial security, include measures to strengthen credit culture,
enhance transparency and governance, improve creditor rights, and strengthen bank
regulation and supervision. In addition, the authorities have implemented a number of
corrective measures to deal with the adverse impact on the banking sector of the 2001-02
terrorism events and four consecutive years of droughts. These include an effective ban
imposed by the central bank on the distribution of dividends in 2005 and 2006 by banks
with shortfalls in provisioning and its requirement that, by 2009, banks have to achieve a
provisioning ratio of NPLs of 70 percent, regardless of existing collateral. Moreover, the
authorities have made provisioning fully tax-deductible and have streamlined the legal
procedures for the realization of collateral. As a result, the financial soundness indicators of
commercial banks have improved markedly. The authorities are confident of continued
strengthening of the financial system; nevertheless, they recognize that acceleration of the
financial sector reform would allow a faster pace of implementation of their medium-term
growth strategy. To better identify financial sector vulnerabilities and chart out an
accelerated course of reforms, they requested an update to the 2002 FSAP. Our authorities
broadly agree with staff recommendations, which include a policy objective of reducing
NPLs ratio to total loans, strengthening management and governance of the remaining
public banks, and accelerating the restructuring of bank loans to the tourism sector.
The authorities recognize that the level of external debt is relatively high, compared to other
emerging market economies with similar ratings. To reduce this vulnerability, they have
decided to allocate US$1.6 billion or two-third of the proceeds from the partial privatization
of Tunisie Telecom to debt reduction operations. When completed, these operations will
contribute to a significant improvement in debt indicators and in the country’s external
position. The authorities consider that continued fiscal consolidation, supported by the
ongoing tax reform, will also contribute to improving debt indicators. Recent policy
announcements in this area include a reduction in the corporate income tax rate from
35 percent to 30 percent, a cut in the number of VAT rates from 4 to 3, as well as measures
to modernize tax administration.
Staff and the authorities have also discussed other policy priorities, in particular measures to
enhance labor market flexibility and to improve the business and investment climate. The
Selected Issues paper offers some interesting insights and conclusions.
Finally, after completing broad consultation with stakeholders, the authorities are now in the
process of finalizing their strategy for the period 2007-2016. The main objectives of this
strategy are reducing unemployment to 10 percent and doubling per capita income by 2016.
Staff will have the opportunity to report back to the Board on the progress in the
implementation of this strategy.
