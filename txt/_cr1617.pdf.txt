IMF Executive Board Concludes 2015 Article IV Consultation with People’s Republic of
China—Hong Kong Special Administrative Region

On January 11, 2016, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded
the Article IV consultation discussions1 with Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (SAR).
Hong Kong SAR’s growth is expected at 2.25 percent in 2015, with domestic demand acting as
the principal source of momentum. Growth is likely to pick up modestly to 2½ percent in 2016,
with a smaller drag from external demand reinforcing resilient domestic demand. Inflation has
declined and is expected to remain below 3 percent in 2015/16 on softer commodity prices. The
current account has dropped to around 2.50 percent of GDP, but is projected to improve to
around 3½ percent over the medium term as the global economy recovers.
The economy has operated with low interest rates for seven years and is now likely to see rates
increase with the Fed liftoff. Generally, favorable spillovers from Mainland China thus far may
also turn more challenging going forward with the ongoing transition to slower, but more
sustainable, growth in the Mainland. The domestic property sector has experienced a renewed
run-up in prices since mid-2014, but there are some signs evident now of a pause in momentum.
Considering the fiscal and financial buffers in place in Hong Kong SAR, these risks are likely to
have limited impact on the economy and financial system provided the increase in interest rates
is gradual (and in line with the path envisaged in the U.S. Federal Reserve’s FOMC median
forecasts for the Federal Funds rate), and Mainland China’s growth slows in orderly fashion.
Nevertheless, if growth slows more than expected in early 2016, fiscal policy will need to
provide additional support in the February budget with an emphasis on expanded relief measures

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with members, usually
every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial information, and discusses with officials
the country's economic developments and policies. On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which
forms the basis for discussion by the Executive Board.

for vulnerable households, small businesses, and accelerated urban renewal and infrastructure
spending where possible.
While property prices are showing some early signs of leveling off, the propensity for further
increases remains because of the underlying shortfall in supply. Sustained efforts to ensure that
the targets of the 2014 Long-Term Housing Strategy are met will be important for managing
public expectations regarding supply and affordability.
Hong Kong SAR has a strong track record of filling regulatory and data gaps, and assessing
systemic risks in the financial system. Essential infrastructure support for healthy market
development has been provided, for instance in offshore RMB services. The resilience of the
economy and financial system was displayed during the past summer when markets functioned
in orderly fashion even as volatility in equity and currency markets increased substantially after
the correction in the Mainland indices. Further strengthening aspects of the defenses will require
completing the process underway for enacting legislation on a comprehensive recovery and
resolution framework; continuing to strengthen the oversight regime for securities markets,
broker dealers and asset managers as their business model evolves with new channels connecting
Hong Kong SAR and Mainland markets; and fully implementing a risk-based capital regime for
insurance companies.
Executive Board Assessment2
Executive Directors commended the authorities for their sound policy management which has
supported steady growth of the economy and its resilience, and low unemployment despite
elevated global financial market volatility. Directors agreed that Hong Kong SAR’s small open
economy faces multiple challenges related to the Fed liftoff, structural change in Mainland
China, and the domestic property sector. However, the strong fiscal and financial buffers will
help mitigate potential negative impacts arising from these risks. Directors welcomed the
authorities’ commitment to stay vigilant and implement a prudent mix of policies to secure
healthy growth in the medium term.
Directors observed that fiscal policy should strike a balance between supporting the economy in
the near term and addressing the future needs of an aging population and a shrinking workforce.
They encouraged proactive use of the fiscal space to cushion the economy if economic activity
weakens significantly in early 2016, by expanding relief measures for vulnerable households and
small businesses, and accelerating urban renewal and infrastructure spending where possible.
They commended the recent progress in a number of areas to address the long-term fiscal
challenges, including the planned Low-Income Working Family Allowance Scheme to

At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the Board, summarizes the views of
Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the country's authorities. An explanation of any qualifiers

incentivize labor force participation and the Future Fund to raise investment returns of the fiscal
reserves.
Directors agreed that restoring demand-supply balance in housing markets should continue to be
a policy priority. They encouraged the authorities to implement the 2014 Long-Term Housing
Strategy effectively to ensure that additional housing supply targets are met and that public
expectations about supply and affordability improve in a durable manner. Directors agreed that
adjustments to stamp duties could be considered if there is a sustained decline in transaction
volumes with the potential to generate adverse spillovers to the broader economy.
Property-related macroprudential measures should also continue to remain in place and any
adjustments should be made based on evolving financial stability risks and not in response to
aggregate demand developments. They recommended monitoring the level of floating rate
mortgages.
Directors noted that Hong Kong SAR has a strong track record of filling regulatory and data
gaps, assessing systemic risks, and strengthening financial institutions’ loss absorption buffers in
a preemptive manner. They encouraged the authorities to complete the legislation on a
comprehensive recovery and resolution framework, to continue to strengthen the oversight
regime for securities markets, broker dealers, and asset managers as their business model evolves
with new channels connecting Hong Kong SAR and Mainland markets, and to fully implement a
risk-based capital regime for insurance companies.
Directors agreed that the Linked Exchange Rate System remains the best arrangement for
Hong Kong SAR and serves as an anchor of stability for this small open economy with a
globally integrated financial services industry.

STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2015 ARTICLE IV CONSULTATION DISCUSSIONS
December 15, 2015

KEY ISSUES
Overview. Growth has been steady, albeit slightly below potential, and the unemployment rate is
low. Nevertheless, the economy faces multiple challenges related to the Fed liftoff, structural change
in Mainland China, and the domestic property sector.
Policies. Addressing these challenges and securing healthy growth into the medium term require
 proactive use of the fiscal space to cushion the economy against near-term shocks;
 maintaining the Linked Exchange Rate System (LERS), an anchor of expectations and cornerstone
of stability for over three decades;
 implementing the 2014 Long-Term Housing Strategy effectively to ensure targets are met and
public expectations about supply and affordability improve in a durable manner;
 adjusting the property-related macroprudential measures based on evolving financial stability
risks and not in response to aggregate demand developments (unless the measures are deemed
to impair credit intermediation and disrupt the banking system’s ability to support the real
economy); and
 further fortifying the defenses of the financial system by enacting a comprehensive recovery and
resolution framework; continuing to strengthen the oversight regime for securities markets; and
implementing a risk-based capital regime for insurance companies.

PEOPLE’S REPUBLIC OF CHINA—HONG KONG SAR

CONTEXT AND RECENT DEVELOPMENTS
1. Context. Hong Kong SAR’s economy has operated with short-term interest rates near zero and long
yields at near-historic lows for the past seven years. During this time, the economy has
also experienced generally favorable spillovers from Mainland China. These tailwinds may become
less powerful going forward. Interest rates in Hong Kong SAR are poised to increase with the Fed
liftoff, through their direct link to U.S. rates via the currency board. The spillovers to Hong Kong SAR
from Mainland China could also prove more challenging than in the past as the Mainland transitions
to slower, but more sustainable growth.
2. Recent developments. Heading into a potentially testing period ahead, activity momentum has
remained steady while credit and asset prices present a mixed picture (Figure 1).


Activity. Growth in the first three quarters has been just over 2½ percent, similar to 2014. Domestic
demand has been the mainstay of activity (particularly private consumption on the back of a tight labor
market, although there are some signs of a moderation in retail sales in recent months). External
demand has weakened gradually over the year, reflecting the global trade slowdown. The unemployment
rate has remained low, at 3.3 percent. CPI inflation has drifted down to 2.4 percent y/y in October, on
lower imported inflation and favorable effects of property rates waivers on the cost of living.



Credit. Overall credit growth has moderated since mid-2014, with a deceleration in foreign
currency-denominated loans. Growth of loans for use in Hong Kong SAR has moderated somewhat, but
remains robust, including to the property sector. The stock of outstanding debt securities where the
ultimate domicile of risk is in Hong Kong SAR also appears to be leveling off, with about 75 percent of
bonds maturing within 1–3 years.



Equity market. The Hang Seng index (HSI) experienced a correction in the wake of the Mainland equity
crash, currently down 20 percent from its peak. The China Enterprises Index “H Share” is down 28 percent
(compared to the 30 percent decline in Shanghai Composite since June 11).



Property sector. Prices resumed their upward rise in Q2:2014. House prices in mass market
segments have tripled relative to their level at end-2008, while those in luxury segments have
almost doubled. These increases reflect strong local end-user demand colliding against tight
housing supply. Completion of private housing units has slowed this year and vacancy rates have
declined. A similar dynamic appears to be at work in the nonresidential property segment as well.
There are now some early signs of a pause in momentum, especially in the secondary market for
residential property and the retail component of the nonresidential sector.

3. External position. The real exchange rate has appreciated 10 percent relative to the 2014 average,
and 17 percent since 2012, a product of the link to the U.S. dollar and relatively higher inflation in
Hong Kong SAR compared to trading partners. The current account balance has stabilized in the
range of 1½2 percent of GDP over this time (and is projected to increase to around 3½ percent
over the medium term as global demand recovers).
4. Buffers. The economy has augmented its buffers even with the robust credit growth of recent years
and the build-up of leverage in an era of low interest rates.

a bank-specific stable-funding requirement was
introduced to ensure that banks with especially rapid credit growth had adequate stable sources of
funding to support their loan book. A countercyclical capital buffer (0.625 percent of risk-weighted
assets) will be introduced in Q1:2016 and domestic systemically important banks will be subject to
additional loss absorbency capital surcharges of 0.2500.625 percent. These measures will provide
further protection to a banking system already capitalized in excess of Basel III levels: as of
September 2015, the total capital adequacy ratio (CAR) for locally incorporated authorized
institutions is 18.1 percent, Tier 1 CAR is 14.9 percent, and the common equity tier 1 (CET-1) ratio is
14.3 percent.



Fiscal. Budget over-performance in recent years has lifted fiscal reserves to 35 percent of GDP, or
about 24 months of total government expenditure. Gross government debt is minimal (around
0.1 percent of GDP).



Households. Although the stock of household debt has risen to historic highs close to 70 percent
of GDP (around two-thirds of which is residential mortgage debt), the Hong Kong Monetary
Authority’s (HKMA’s) mandatory debt service stress tests on mortgage applicants has contained the
debt service burden among new borrowers. New borrowers’ debt service relative to disposable
income has declined from 41 percent in August 2010 to 35 percent in 2014. Furthermore, the
number of owner-occupied households with mortgages or loans has contracted by nearly
one-fourth since the global financial crisis with only one-third of owner-occupied households
currently carrying mortgages or loans.

analysis suggests that this pace of increase in
interest rates will have a modest negative impact on domestic demand; furthermore, in light of the
prudential measures deployed by the regulators, Hong Kong SAR’s financial system appears well
placed to handle portfolio adjustments along this path of rising interest rates;



a slight moderation in credit for use in Hong Kong SAR: tighter macroprudential measures
(additional capital surcharges from Q1:2016) will restrain supply, while higher borrowing costs will
weaken demand;



Mainland China’s growth slows moderately to a range of 6–6½ percent: tourism spending in Hong
Kong SAR and other activity in Hong Kong SAR with direct links to Mainland China’s economy
(trade, financial sector) stabilize accordingly; bank buffers are adequate for absorbing associated
asset quality deterioration on Mainland exposures; and



support from fiscal policy: based on the government’s budget projections, adjusted for revenue
overperformance in line with historical outturns, the fiscal stance for FY2016/17 delivers an
expansionary impulse of around 1 percent of GDP.

6. Inflation. Inflation is expected to remain below
3 percent in 2015 and 2016, compared to an
average of 4 percent over the last five years. The
softer pressure reflects weaker global commodity
prices and the modest pick-up in real activity
projected over 2015/16. In line with the
developments over the last three years, nominal
wages are expected to continue growing at a
moderate rate despite the tight labor market. Unit
labor costs are therefore likely to remain
contained.

Box 1. Potential Output Growth in Hong Kong 1/
The Hong Kong SAR economy has been growing moderately since 2012, after a strong recovery in 2010–2011 following the
global financial crisis. A key question is whether this slowdown is cyclical or structural. Various estimation methods suggest
that the annual growth rate of potential output has been around 3–3.5 percent in recent years, slower than the pace prior to
the global financial crisis. The slowdown in actual output growth is in line with slower potential output growth.
There has been a growth deceleration since 2012. The average growth rate since 2012 is about 2.5 percent per year,
about 2 percentage points lower than 2000–2007. Although some slowdown might be a natural consequence as the
economy becomes more advanced, the pace of adjustment seems to be less gradual than expected. A critical question for
policy makers is whether the slowdown is reflecting weaker potential output growth or just a cyclical phenomenon.
The Hodrick-Prescott filter method implies that the pace of potential output growth is still at about 3½ percent
per year. The sample period is from 1961 to 2014. Except for the years during the Asian financial crisis, there has been a
clear long-run pattern of gradual deceleration in trend output. The average growth of trend GDP from 2012 to 2014 is
about 3.6 percent. The level of actual real GDP has been lower than the HP trend since 2012.
The multivariate approach suggests slower potential growth in recent years, although it is still above 3 percent per
year. One of the drawback of the HP filter approach is that it is a pure statistical method without relying on any economic
theory. A multivariate approach, which includes some underlying relationship among output, inflation and unemployment
rate through the Philips curve and Okun’s law, would provide an estimate of potential output that does not create an
upward or downward inflation bias. Thus, the moderate inflation and relatively tight labor market conditions in recent years
would suggest a stronger cyclical position than that implied by HP filter method. As a result, relative to the trend growth
estimated by HP filter method, the average growth rate of potential output estimated by multivariate approach is lower in
recent years.
The production function approach also points to average potential growth above 3 percent per year. Based on the
recent research by HKMA, average TFP growth has dropped from 4.0 percent per year (2000–2008) to about 2.6 percent
(2009–2013). The estimation is based on a sectoral growth accounting exercise, covering several key sectors accounting for
over 90 percent of GDP in Hong Kong. Since part of the TFP drop is likely to be a cyclical phenomenon (TFP is pro-cyclical),
a moderate contribution from physical capital deepening and human capital growth (at least in the medium term) would
bring annual real GDP growth rate back to 3 percent or above.

Authorities’ Views
7.
Outlook. The authorities noted that weaker tourism inflows and subdued global trade throughput
are weighing on activity, even as domestic demand remains resilient. Labor shortages in many sectors, rising
wages, and improvements in job security have supported consumer sentiment. High infrastructure spending
has provided additional momentum. However, external headwinds are likely to remain strong into next year
and, as such, Hong Kong SAR’s GDP growth is expected to remain subpar, similar to recent outturns. The
authorities further noted that inflation is easing and likely to remain contained owing to lower commodity
prices, weaker pressure from property rental rates, and the tentative outlook for real activity.
8.
External position. The authorities expected a gradual improvement in the current account as the
global economy recovers. However, they did not see the external balance returning to the relatively high
levels of the precrisis years, in part because of the rebalancing that has occurred in the Mainland since then. In
addition, they noted a solid increase in Hong Kong SAR’s domestic demand with the sustained rise in
property prices, which has had the effect of compressing the current account surplus.

RISKS AND SPILLOVERS
9.
Risks are tilted to the downside (Appendix II) and arise from four main sources. High household
and corporate leverage leave the private sector exposed to rising debt service costs in the event of a sharperthan-anticipated increase in interest rates. Spillovers from the Mainland have been strong and may intensify.
The run-up in property prices over the past year raises the probability of a correction. Finally, there is a low
probability-high impact risk of sharper-than-anticipated increases in interest rates coinciding with a fasterthan-expected slowdown in Mainland China.

A. Interest Rates: A Bumpy Ascent?
10.
A principal near-term risk is higher volatility in global financial markets in the aftermath of the Fed
liftoff, with interest rates rising more sharply than anticipated in the baseline (Figure 2). The highly
compressed term premium (the yield on Hong Kong SAR 10y government bonds is currently some 50 basis
points below that on U.S. 10y treasury bonds) also raises the possibility of a strong snap back at longer

maturities. Long yields could rise faster than expected if the target range for the Fed Funds rate follows
a path closer to the upper bound of FOMC forecasts rather than the median (with short rates in Hong
Kong SAR and the entire yield curve shifting up in response). A second possibility is that the Fed Funds
target range follows the median path, but aggressive portfolio rebalancing back toward U.S. dollar
assets leads to a rapid decompression of spreads globally and, as a result, long yields in Hong Kong
SAR rise faster than expected.
11.
If such a shock were to materialize, domestic demand in Hong Kong SAR could be adversely affected
(Box 2). Private consumption would be disrupted if interest rates were to spike (with the debt service ratio
for new mortgage borrowers rising from its current relatively low level of around 35 percent to between
5060 percent, depending on the magnitude of the rate increase). Rising costs of refinancing and rolling over
corporate debt could inhibit investment, although staff analysis suggests that for a given rate increase the
impact is likely to be less severe than in the case of private consumption. The overall slowdown in domestic
demand could impair asset quality and hurt banking sector profitability, while higher interest rates would
affect the value of banks’ securities holdings, thereby constraining their ability to lend.
Authorities’ Views
12.
Repricing of the yield curve. The authorities considered the possibility of asset price corrections and
a repricing of the yield curve in Hong Kong SAR a tangible risk as part of a generalized regional sell-off. They
noted that parts of Emerging Asia, where U.S. dollar-denominated debt is high, could be vulnerable to tighter
external financial conditions and a potentially stronger dollar in the aftermath of the Fed liftoff. Any resulting
financial instability in the region could generate contagion effects in Hong Kong SAR and, depending on the
severity of the shock, could also hurt domestic demand.
13.
Financial system resilience. The authorities highlighted that the prudential measures, taken
ever since liquidity began flooding into Hong Kong SAR with the onset of unconventional monetary
policy elsewhere, have strengthened buffers in the financial system and prepared it for the eventual
normalization of interest rates. The financial system is therefore expected to remain resilient in the face
of rising interest rates even if real activity slows. Furthermore, an overall favorable international
investment position would distinguish Hong Kong SAR from economies with weaker fundamentals once
investors become more discerning as the era of ultra-cheap money ends.

B. Exposures to Economic and Financial Stress on the Mainland
14.
Closer integration with the economy of Mainland China has brought several benefits to Hong Kong
SAR, but also leaves it vulnerable to inward spillovers. The real sector linkages, especially in tourism, have
grown rapidly after the easing of entry visa restrictions on Mainland visitors. Financial linkages have also
deepened in recent years with the increase in cross-border bank lending, securities issuance in Hong Kong
SAR by Mainland entities, and the internationalization of the RMB. Vulnerabilities from the various channels
appear manageable provided the ongoing adjustment to slower and more sustainable growth in the
Mainland remains orderly.

12

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

PEOPLE’S REPUBLIC OF CHINA—HONG KONG SAR

Box 2. The Impact of Rising Interest Rates on Domestic Demand in Hong Kong SAR 1/
Since the Linked Exchange Rate System (LERS) was adopted in 1983, the Fed has had six rate hike cycles. Interest rates in
Hong Kong SAR have risen in tandem with U.S. rates over these cycles. Comparing pre- and post-rate hike years, growth in
Hong Kong SAR has slowed in three instances of these six Fed tightening episodes. Private domestic demand in Hong Kong
SAR—particularly household consumption—has generally grown at a slower pace in the aftermath of U.S. rate hikes, but
has remained resilient. A key difference this time is that private sector debt is much larger compared to past tightening
phases, raising the possibility of a significant retrenchment in spending if interest rates increase more steeply than expected.
Provided interest rates in Hong Kong SAR rise in line with the projected median path of the FOMC’s target
forecast range for the Fed Funds rate, domestic demand will not be adversely affected. It is likely that the pace of
interest rate increases will be gradual especially since the monetary base has expanded considerably since 2009. This will
allow households and corporates to adjust spending patterns smoothly. If household income and corporate profitability
grow at a steady pace in line with Staff’s baseline scenario for the economy, the increase in debt service burdens will be
manageable.
To quantify the potential impact of higher interest rates on private sector activity, Staff estimate private
consumption and corporate investment functions for Hong Kong SAR. Aggregate consumption is modeled as a
function of income (proxied by real payrolls), wealth (real property and stock price), and the debt service burden
(ratio of mortgage payments relative to household income, as reported by the Centaline Agency in Hong Kong SAR).
Two specifications are estimated – ordinary least squares (OLS) and an error-correction model (ECM)—over
1994:Q12015:Q2. Private investment is modeled as a function of lagged investment and cash flow, both scaled by
capital stock; leverage ratio (debt / equity); and a variant of Tobin’s Q (sum of market capitalization and total debt,
relative to total assets). The model is estimated using annual data from Worldscope, covering about 1000 firms in Hong
Kong SAR’s manufacturing and service sectors over 1995–2014.
The relationships estimated over the past two decades suggest that private consumption would be affected
more severely than investment for a given interest rate shock. A shock of 300bps increase in mortage rates is
considered. Households’ mortgage payment-to-income ratio would rise by about 16 percentage points, assuming that
there is no income growth at all. The OLS and ECM model coefficients indicate that the elasticity of consumption with
respect to debt service burden is around 0.5, suggesting that household consumption would decline by about
7-8 percent if mortgage rates rise by 300 bps. This estimate is potentially a lower bound since the effect on household
consumption of a large increase in interest rates will most likely be nonlinear (reflecting an accelerating retrenchment in
spending as interest rates rise).
In the case of private investment, estimation results show that the direct effect of a 300 bps increase in interest rates is
to reduce corporate investment by ½ to 1 percent (assuming that there is no change in other factors including expected
future profitability, as captured by the Q ratio, and leverage). As of 2014, the median effective interest rate in the sample
of 1000 firms studied was about 4½ percent and the median cash flow-to-capital stock ratio was 0.214. The 300 bps
increase in interest rates would reduce the cash flow-to-capital stock to 0.179. In the presence of credit constraints that
prevent smoothing of the shock to cash flows, investment declines as reported above. This modest impact based on the
response of corporate investment to previous rate tightening cycles is likely to be a lower bound for the overall effect of
higher interest rates. Additional indirect effects are likely to be expressed through lower expected profitability.

Trade and tourism
A sharper-than-anticipated slowdown in the Mainland would hit trade and wholesale warehousing in
Hong Kong SAR, with large employment losses (13 percent of the labor force is occupied in these
activities). Mainland visitors accounted for around 40 percent of overall retail sales in 2014, up from
almost 25 percent in 2009. A downturn on the Mainland would therefore also hurt tourism and retail sales
in Hong Kong SAR. This year, with growth in the Mainland slowing, tourist arrivals in Hong Kong SAR
have already seen declines, as have re-exports to and from the Mainland. The contraction on both fronts
has affected the aggregate amounts of tourist inflows and re-exports noticeably, reflecting the
importance of the Mainland components for both categories.

Banking system claims on Mainland banks. Hong Kong SAR-based banks have gross claims on
onshore Chinese banks amounting to HK$2.1 trillion (around 90 percent of GDP). These include surplus
RMB funds parked at Chinese correspondent banks or the People’s Bank of China, trade settlement
claims, and debt securities issued by the Chinese banks.



Banking system claims on nonbank Mainland entities are now at HK$4.6 trillion (195 percent of GDP),
nearly four times as large as in 2010 (Figure 3). So far, asset quality on these exposures has remained
broadly in line with overall asset quality in the Hong Kong SAR banking system. However, the ultimate risk
exposure remains unclear due to possible on-lending in some instances by immediate borrowers. If
Mainland growth and financial stresses emerge in some key sectors such as export-oriented
manufacturing or real estate, these risks could come to the fore. Local Hong Kong SAR banks—including
Mainland subsidiaries of locally incorporated banks—account for close to sixty percent of these claims,
with branches of foreign banks in Hong Kong SAR accounting for the rest. Since forty percent of the
exposure is accounted for by foreign banks, the direct impact on the financial system in Hong Kong SAR
may not be as large as the size of the headline claims suggests. However, depending on the severity of
the downturn, the unfolding of events in the Mainland could lead to a sharp deterioration in asset quality
in the Hong Kong SAR banking system, leading banks to slow their lending more broadly.



Offshore U.S. dollar securities issuance by Chinese firms. In recent years, Chinese corporations have
increasingly issued U.S. dollar bonds with relatively short maturities in Hong Kong SAR to take advantage
of the low interest rates on offer. The outstanding amount of such bonds with the Mainland listed as the

ultimate domicile of risk reached US$191 billion (around 70 percent of GDP) as of October 2015.
The investor base includes Hong Kong SAR banks, global bond funds, and private banking clients.
The issuers, some with relatively weak credit profiles, span a range of sectors. B- or BB-rated
property developers account for 26 percent of the total amount outstanding. However, the recent
opening of cheap funding options via the onshore bond market appears to have lowered the
financing risks of these borrowers.


Offshore RMB market. The international appeal and use of RMB has grown rapidly since 2010.
Measures introduced by the Hong Kong SAR authorities—setting up a RMB Real Time Gross
Settlement System, streamlining liquidity facilities, facilitating a CNH Hibor fixing—have
consolidated Hong Kong SAR’s position as the premier offshore RMB center during this time. As
the Mainland capital account opens further, the volume of RMB transactions in Hong Kong SAR and
prospects for revenues (including securities issuance fees, fx option premia, and interest income)
from this business are expected to continue on an upward path. While RMB activity in other
financial centers (Singapore, London) has picked up in the last 2–3 years, the spread of offshore
liquidity pools will complement Hong Kong SAR’s first-mover advantages in this area by increasing
the demand for wholesale RMB services. However, as seen in recent months, when markets worry
about Mainland growth prospects and RMB depreciation pressures intensify, this temporarily slows
the growth of the offshore RMB business in Hong Kong SAR. RMB deposits declined and the
CNY/CNH spread widened significantly in the summer as the Mainland authorities tightened
their monitoring of arbitrage flows (Figure 4). Staff analysis suggests that dim sum (offshore
RMB-denominated) bond issuance is negatively affected when markets expect the CNH to
depreciate (Box 3). Going forward, if RMB depreciation pressures re-emerge, this may hurt revenue
streams for financial institutions. Pressures in the spot CNH market could also test the derivatives
market (the U.S. dollar/CNH cross-currency swap has grown to become one of the most liquid fx
options in Asia) and expose financial intermediaries to bunched redemption requests at particular
thresholds for the exchange rate.



Shanghai-Hong Kong Stock Connect and Mainland–Hong Kong Mutual Recognition of Funds.
New channels for two-way flows between the Mainland and Hong Kong SAR have been opened
over the past year. The Connect scheme (launched in November 2014) permits individuals and
institutions with brokerage accounts in either Shanghai or Hong Kong SAR to trade stocks in the
other market, subject to daily and aggregate quotas, while the Mutual Recognition of Funds
(inaugurated in July 2015, with the first batch of funds currently going through the approval
process) permits mutual funds in either location to mobilize investments from the other jurisdiction,
subject to regulatory approval and also within an overall quota. The closer integration of the stock
markets facilitates greater trading volumes and enhances market liquidity, but also creates new
channels for volatility and financial stress in one location to be transmitted to the other. Staff
analysis shows that correlations between Hong Kong SAR stock indices and the Mainland indices
have grown in recent months, with particular sectors (construction, financials) more sensitive to
spillovers (Box 4). The schemes are in their early stages of rollout at this point but, going forward,
should extended periods of high volatility occur, this may hurt real activity in Hong Kong SAR and
affect financial intermediation services (including lower appetite for initial public offerings; outflows
from mutual funds; losses and debt service difficulties by leveraged investors in the equity market).

Box 3. Determinants of Dim Sum Bond Issuance 1/
Since the first issuance in 2007, dim sum bonds have served as a key asset class for offshore renminbi and an
alternative source of funding. Among factors that have determined dim sum bond issuance, exchange rate
expectations are important but not the only driving influence.

A diverse range of issuers has tapped the dim sum bond market. The Chinese government has
issued dim sum bonds every year since 2009. Other issuers include financial institutions and corporates
from China and elsewhere. In terms of sectoral breakdown, real estate accounts for about 23 percent.
Although nonresident issuers are accounting for an increasing share over time, Chinese issuers
continue to dominate the issuance.

Possible factors that influence dim sum bond issuance include monetary conditions in China
and global markets, expectations of exchange rate movements, interest rate differentials between
onshore and offshore markets, effective funding cost if bond proceeds are swapped into dollars, excess
demand for RMB assets offshore, and policy changes in China and other offshore RMB centers.

Regression analysis shows that the net issuance of dim sum bonds has been driven mainly by
expectations of the renminbi appreciation. However, in some sub-samples of bonds, other factors are
important as well. In a separate regression for nonfinancial corporate bonds, the interest differential
between onshore and offshore markets has a statistically significant association with net issuance, but
the exchange rate expectation does not. The CNH-CNY basis spread, which reflects in part a measure
of excess demand for RMB assets by offshore investors, decreased with net issuance.

Box 4. Financial Connectedness between Hong Kong SAR and Mainland:
Evidence from Equity Markets 1/
Hong Kong SAR’s ties to Mainland China have increased significantly during the last decade or so, especially as the
Mainland started liberalizing its financial markets and opening its capital account. Developments in Mainland
equity markets inevitably have increasingly spilled over into Hong Kong SAR’s equity market.
To understand how the interdependence of financial markets across the Mainland and Hong Kong SAR
has evolved over time, this box applies the connectedness index (CI) proposed by Diebold and Yilmaz (2009,
2012). The CI allows one to quantify the contribution of shocks from the Mainland (and other markets) to Hong
Kong SAR’s equity returns and volatilities at different points in time.
The results suggest that financial interlinkages between the Mainland and Hong Kong equity markets are
strong and growing over time. Given the size of China’s economy, it is not surprising that developments in
China’s financial markets have become increasingly more important for Hong Kong SAR (as well as the rest of the
global economy).


First, average connectedness (which measures the gross spillovers from China to other economies) shows
that China’s equity markets explain a larger share of Hong Kong SAR’s equity returns (and volatility) than
other economies.



Second, financial connectedness between China and
Hong Kong SAR has increased sharply over the last
decade or so, consistent with continuing trade
integration and rapidly rising financial integration
(evidenced by, inter alia, the volume of cross-border
loans and equity listings). In terms of the CI, equity
market spillovers from China to Hong Kong have risen

Authorities’ views
15.
Credit risks. The authorities viewed the credit risks on Mainland exposures as manageable despite the
concerns about Mainland growth prospects and the health of key sectors such as property, steel, and
export-oriented manufacturing. They noted that the NPL ratio for Mainland subsidiaries of Hong Kong SAR
banks has risen in recent months. But since Mainland exposures incurred by these subsidiaries account for less
than 20 percent of the banking sector’s total, the impact on the overall asset quality of Mainland exposures is
not significant. In fact, the NPL ratio of the banking sector’s total Mainland exposures has remained low and is
only slightly above the overall NPL of the banking sector’s total credit exposures (0.49 percent as of end-June
2015). Furthermore, they noted that under close monitoring by the regulators, Hong Kong SAR banks and their
Mainland subsidiaries have maintained high origination and underwriting standards: large Mainland SOEs and
other nonprivate entities account for around half of the total borrowing, international corporations and Hong
Kong SAR-based conglomerates with operations in the Mainland constitute a third of the borrowing, and the
rest is accounted for by private entities backed by Mainland bank letters of credit or secured by collateral.
16.
Offshore RMB business. The authorities viewed the recent stall in activity as a temporary interlude
while markets adjust exchange rate expectations. The decline in RMB deposits in Hong Kong SAR was
attributed in part to an unwinding of the carry trade converting RMB deposits into Hong Kong dollar or U.S.
dollar. The drop in dim sum bond issuance was also viewed as a cyclical phenomenon since onshore funding
costs had fallen sharply, making it more attractive to raise funds on the Mainland instead. The authorities also
observed that global risk appetite was a significant contributor to the CNH/CNY spread, especially during
the summer months. However, they noted they did not see any systemic risks related to activity in the CNH
derivatives markets, as speculation on one-way RMB appreciation had eased following some weakening of the
currency in the first half of 2014, well ahead of the August 2015 changes to the CNY central parity fixing
mechanism. The Shanghai-Hong Kong Stock Connect scheme was also viewed as functioning in orderly
fashion even during and after the Mainland equity markets correction during the summer. Looking ahead, the
authorities expected that further opening of the Mainland capital account with the extension of the stock
connect scheme to Shenzhen, the ‘One Belt, One Road’ initiative, expansion of inward RMB Qualified Foreign
Institutional Investor (R-QFII) and outward RMB Qualified Domestic Institutional Investor (R-QDII) schemes, and
greater take up of RMB cash-pooling programs by firms to facilitate regional corporate treasury operations,
would increase the volume of RMB flows through Hong Kong SAR and maintain the steadily expanding
international use of the currency.

C. Property Prices: Ripe for a Correction?
17.
The propensity for property price run-ups in Hong Kong
SAR is rooted in a fundamental demand-supply imbalance at
work for some time (Figure 5). Nevertheless, around the rising
trend, there have been times when prices have slowed or hit a
plateau before accelerating again. Prices have also declined
around periods of heightened financial volatility (200809 and
201112). At present, the market appears to be experiencing the
onset of relative calm after having gathered steam over the past
18 months.

18.
In the recent run-up, despite the well
telegraphed increases in U.S. interest rates, households
have continued to opt for floating rate mortgages which
will reset in the aftermath of the Fed liftoff. Over
80 percent of new mortgages have been priced off
HIBOR in recent months, up from close to zero in 2012.
A turbulent and faster-than-expected increase in interest
rates could therefore sharply slow property price growth
if demand softens in response to the higher cost of
borrowing.
19.
Nonresidential property price growth has also
accelerated, with particularly sharp increases seen in the
category of flatted factories (that is, vacant former
manufacturing sites acquired for commercial
redevelopment). Prices have run far ahead of rents and
average yields are currently around half their levels
pre-2009. With early signs now evident of a slowdown,
particularly in the retail segment, there is the risk that a
price reversal would reduce collateral values and make it
difficult for corporates to rollover credit, thus exposing
banks to losses in their corporate loan book.

Authorities’ Views
20.
Residential property, domestic demand and the banking sector. The authorities noted that the
property market may lose some momentum with the interest rate upcycle, but the overall impact was hard to
predict. Much will also depend on how the demand-supply imbalance evolves. With wages and job security
likely to remain firm, household demand was expected to stay solid. Adverse turns in price dynamics were
unlikely to have a major impact on banks’ asset quality, provisioning, or capital positions since the
macroprudential measures have been effective in increasing buffers. History provides reassurance as well—
the 70 percent property price correction over 1997–2003, when starting buffers were smaller than at present,
had not severely dented bank balance sheets.
21.
Exposures to nonresidential property. The authorities did not view the nonresidential
segment as posing a systemic risk to the banking system since banks’ exposure to business loans
backed by nonresidential property collateral was regarded as limited. Furthermore, the macroprudential
measures apply to commercial property loans as well. Together with the double ad valorem stamp duty
on purchases, the measures have made leveraged purchases of nonresidential property an expensive
proposition. Corporates would rather use their cash to expand their core business than engage in
property investment activities.

200809, the unemployment rate could increase by
as much 2–3 percentage points (although the integration with the Mainland has increased since
these previous episodes and they may therefore underestimate the extent of the negative impact).
Job losses will be widespread, with construction and retail likely to take the biggest hit. The direct

provisioning for souring loans.

While the headline trade balance may not register a large impact (since imports and re-exports

developments), while, equally, poor returns on Hong
Kong SAR exposures could trigger sales in other markets. As an illustration, during the Fed taper
tantrum episode in 2013, bond exchange traded funds (ETFs) and mutual funds flows rapidly turned
negative once the U.S. Treasury 10y yield volatility spiked and markets reassessed prospects of the Fed
tapering its purchases of longer maturity securities. These flows are only a subset of the overall flows
into Hong Kong SAR. Furthermore, since 2013, liquidity has become more of a concern in global
markets, particularly in high yield corporate and EM bonds, suggesting that price sensitivity to shifts in
sentiment has likely increased over the intervening period (see the April and October 2015 Global
Financial Stability Reports for more discussion).

Authorities’ Views
25.
Perfect storm. The authorities viewed the adverse scenario as a very low-probability event, but
were nevertheless prepared via internal contingency planning since Hong Kong SAR as a small open
economy will inevitably experience inward spillovers from global stress. The several rounds of prudential
measures were seen as essential preparation for an eventual return to more normal funding conditions.
The authorities felt that bank and household buffers provided substantial padding against adverse
outcomes, and the track record of bouncing back quickly after large global shocks suggested that the
risk of a protracted downturn in Hong Kong SAR is low.
26.
Banks. The HKMA has been particularly watchful of how banks (including branches of globally
active institutions) have managed liquidity through tenor matching of assets and liabilities and
compliance with stable funding requirements. The authorities noted that the introduction of the stable
funding requirement in 2014 had induced branches of foreign banks to rely more on head office
funding. Local banks have limited exposure to foreign bank branches through the interbank market,
thereby containing potential contagion from global developments to the banking system in Hong Kong
SAR. Furthermore, the authorities observed that banks in general had been prudent in managing fx risk
exposures.

24

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

PEOPLE’S REPUBLIC OF CHINA—HONG KONG SAR

27.
Asset managers. The authorities noted that on account of the long-term institutional investor
base in Hong Kong SAR, daily redemptions tended to be relatively low even during periods of stress
such as the Mainland equity market correction in the summer. Furthermore, they emphasized that fund
managers are required to demonstrate at the product approval stage that they have a robust liquidity
risk management program in place to reduce their vulnerabilities to bunched redemption requests.
They also considered that fund managers had tools to minimize the risk of large withdrawals—for
instance, through passing on trading costs to exiting shareholders so as to protect the remaining
shareholders from dilution of net asset value. Nevertheless, they agreed the situation bears close
watching, including, if needed, via daily reporting of redemptions relative to assets under management,
as they had introduced over the summer. This may become more relevant as global fund managers
domicile in Hong Kong SAR and redirect internationally mobilized funding to access the Mainland stock
markets through the Mutual Recognition of Funds program.

POLICY MIX TO BUILD RESILIENCE
A. Fiscal
28.
Casting fiscal policy in a medium-term framework as laid out in the 2014 Report on Long-Term Fiscal
Planning is appropriate and warranted, considering the future needs of an aging population. However, since
growth has been subpotential in recent years and inflation is moderating, there is merit in privileging the
short-term stabilization needs of the economy should activity disappoint in the months ahead. Favorable debt
dynamics provide latitude to flexibly implement the medium-term strategy (Appendix III).
29.
The fiscal stance for FY 2016/17 implied by this year’s budget strikes a balance between providing
near-term support to the economy while maintaining fiscal reserve accumulation consistent with
the long-term needs of an aging society (Figure 6). In the event that growth underperforms in the Q4 outturn
and momentum heading into 2016 appears to be severely weakened (for example, in retail sales, tourism,
retained imports, and credit growth for use in Hong Kong SAR), an additional expansionary bias in the
2016/17 fiscal stance would be appropriate, with an emphasis on


expanded relief measures for vulnerable households (extra allowances for the elderly and physically
challenged; lower thresholds for providing rental relief to families in public housing; additional property
rates waivers);



small businesses (tax relief, subsidized / concessionary access to funding through credit guarantee
schemes); and



accelerated urban renewal and development in Kowloon and the New Territories.

30.
Looking beyond near-term considerations, demographic change will place additional demands on
public finances. The labor force is projected to decline from 2019, accompanied by the rise of total population
and the elderly dependency ratio. With the aging population, GDP and government revenue may grow at a
slower pace than expenditure and the fiscal balance would eventually weaken on a structural basis.

The current pace of fiscal reserve accumulation is therefore broadly appropriate from an
intergenerational perspective. The initiative to invest a portion of the fiscal reserves in higher-return
assets via the proposed Future Fund will provide a useful mechanism to generate additional resources
for an aging population. Once the Fund is operative, the investment strategy should be regularly
monitored to ensure that the government’s liquidity needs are adequately safeguarded even as the
portfolio allocation strives to achieve higher returns.
31.
Authorities’ views. The authorities noted that ever since the Global Financial Crisis the budget
has incorporated relief measures for the vulnerable and small businesses, which they assess to have
been effective in protecting jobs. They further noted that the fiscal reserves provided them policy
headroom to respond based on the needs of the business cycle, as they had done so during the SARS
epidemic and the Global Financial Crisis, and they would take steps as required to support the
economy, while remaining mindful of looming fiscal challenges over the long run.
26

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

PEOPLE’S REPUBLIC OF CHINA—HONG KONG SAR

B. Linked Exchange Rate System (LERS)
32.
The LERS is the best arrangement for Hong Kong SAR, particularly at a time when the outlook for the
global economy and financial markets is turning more tentative.


The currency board remains an anchor of stability for this small open economy with a large, globally
integrated financial services industry highly exposed to cross-border portfolio adjustments. The
supporting policy and institutional apparatus that guarantees the smooth functioning of the currency
board remains firmly in place and is viewed as credible and robust—ample fiscal reserves that can be
rapidly deployed to cushion macro shocks, strong regulatory and supervisory frameworks, and a healthy
financial system. The most recent evidence of the credibility markets attach to the system was seen during
the heightened regional financial stress in August-September 2015: the LERS anchored expectations and
the Hong Kong dollar traded close to the strong side of the convertibility undertaking even as other
currencies in the region depreciated sharply.



The possibility of further U.S. dollar appreciation (and therefore Hong Kong dollar against other
currencies as well) in the near-term raises concerns of diminishing competitiveness, amplified at times
such as the present conjuncture where the RMB faces depreciation pressures. Nevertheless, Hong Kong
SAR’s flexible markets allow rapid adjustment and help ensure that departures from the equilibrium REER
do not persist.



The July 2015 External Sector Report concluded that Hong Kong SAR’s external positions in 2014 and
2015 (through May) were broadly consistent with medium-term fundamentals and desirable policy
settings. The large total gaps implied by EBA-type regressions (about 10½ percent of GDP in 2014)
mainly came from regression residuals while the contributions from policy gaps were neutral. An updated
EBA-type regression, which reflects the developments through September 2015, delivers essentially the
same results (Appendix IV). The overall assessment remains that the external position is broadly
consistent with medium-term fundamentals and desirable policy settings.

33.
Authorities’ views. The authorities noted that the currency board has continued to function
smoothly through repeated episodes of stress in global financial markets in recent years. They did not see the
LERS as compromising Hong Kong SAR’s competitiveness and viewed the real effective exchange rate as in
line with fundamentals. Domestic wage and price flexibility, together with smooth reallocation of resources
across sectors, have allowed the economy to adjust without costly disruptions to activity. The authorities
noted that the minimum wage (introduced in 2011 and subsequently raised in 2013 and 2015), has not
reduced flexibility in the labor market. As another example of flexibility, the authorities pointed to recent
reductions in unit prices in the retail sector as evidence of the domestic adjustment mechanism at work.

C. Financial Sector
34.
In its capacity to assess systemic risks, and its track record of closing regulatory and data gaps, Hong
Kong SAR’s regulatory and supervisory framework is a global standard setter. With regard to banks, the
emphasis is on preserving ample loss absorption buffers, limiting leveraged exposures to asset prices, and
containing vulnerabilities to sudden stops in short-term funding. Specifically on Mainland exposures, onsite
examination of banks’ credit underwriting has been intensified, asset quality is closely monitored and, where
INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

27

PEOPLE’S REPUBLIC OF CHINA—HONG KONG SAR

necessary, additional provisioning for losses is required. Nevertheless, there is room to further strengthen
aspects of the defenses. The main areas that warrant continued attention are


completing the process underway for enacting legislation on a comprehensive recovery and resolution
framework;



further strengthening the oversight regime for securities markets, broker dealers and asset managers as
their business model evolves with new channels connecting Hong Kong SAR and Mainland markets; and



fully implementing a risk-based capital regime for insurance companies.

35.
In addition, the emerging risk from new channels connecting Hong Kong SAR with the Mainland may
call for stricter eligibility criteria for participation in stock connect schemes and, if needed, steps to contain
risks to the broader financial system (prudential measures including greater provisioning and tighter risk
weights on banks’ securities exposures via the new connect schemes). Continued strict implementation of
anti-money laundering controls (building on measures already taken last July, when the HKMA issued its first
sanction for breach of compliance with the 2012 AML/CFT Ordinance), together with steps to additionally
strengthen transparency of legal persons and trusts, would help further protect Hong Kong SAR’s
hard-earned reputation as a premier global financial center.
36.
Authorities’ views. The authorities reported significant progress in implementing the
recommendations of the 2014 Financial Sector Assessment Program (FSAP).1 The legislation for establishment
of the independent Insurance Authority (IIA) was enacted in July 2015. The IIA is expected to be set up by
end-2016. Components of a risk-based capital regime for insurance companies are being put in place, and
the authorities expect to complete the preparation work for the new regime in 23 years mainly because
determining the capital requirements for each company based on its risk exposure (Pillar I) will take time on
account of the diverse insurance landscape in Hong Kong SAR. The other pillars of the regime—corporate
governance standards, enterprise risk management, and self-assessment of risks and solvency position (Pillar
2) as well as disclosure standards and enhancing transparency (Pillar 3)—may be instituted sooner. For life
insurance companies, the regulators have required weekly reporting of solvency ratios (the ratio of total
assets at fair value minus total liabilities, normally adjusted with prevailing interest rates, to the required
margin of solvency should be at least 150 percent). General insurance companies are required to maintain at
least 200 percent solvency ratio. The authorities further noted that periodic stress testing on assets is also
performed. Risks from the new channels connecting the Mainland and Hong Kong SAR were seen as
manageable so far. The regulators are attuned to preventing funds from engaging in regulatory arbitrage (for
instance, Mainland funds listing in Hong Kong SAR to principally invest back in the Mainland, rather than
listing directly in the Mainland itself). More broadly, they view asset management as a potential high growth
area and have streamlined taxes, stamp duties, and the legal framework governing fund structures to attract
asset managers to domicile in Hong Kong SAR.

D. Property Sector
37.
While there are some early signs that the property sector is beginning to slow, the potential for a
renewed pick up remains high considering the underlying demand pressures and tight supply. Therefore, the

Stamp duties. The three stamp duties currently in place—Special Stamp Duty on resale of residential
properties within 36 months of purchase; Buyer’s Stamp Duty on purchases by nonresidents; and double
ad valorem stamp duty on nonresidential and multiple residential property purchases—have helped curb
excess demand by limiting speculative transactions. Barring a precipitous fall in transactions, the stamp
duties should not be rolled back.

is nearly twice the yearly average produced in
recent years. There is merit in expediting the process for identifying the land and building sites, together
with conducting the relevant environmental, transport, and community facility assessments so as to
cement public expectations that the target will be met. This will help alleviate affordability concerns,
particularly for low-income households, although the full impact will necessarily be felt only with a lag
once the actual construction nears completion.
2006/07



 On counter-cyclical macroprudential policies, staff sees a case for holding firm on the tight ceilings on LTV
and DSR ratios and the floor on risk weights tied to property loans as a way of continuing to limit banks’
exposure to property sector. These policies have strengthened banks’ mortgage loan origination
standards without getting in their way of intermediating credit to the real economy. Adjustments to the
property-related macroprudential measures should be made based on evolving financial stability risks
and not in response to aggregate demand developments (unless the measures are deemed to impair
credit intermediation and disrupt the banking system’s ability to support the real economy).
38.
Authorities’ views. The authorities emphasized that boosting supply is a priority. Land for
constructing 254,000 of the 290,000 public housing units, which is the target set by the Long-Term Housing
Strategy over the next decade, has already been identified. As for private housing land supply, the authorities
aimed to maintain land supply from various sources for about 190,000 units over the next decade. With
regard to stamp duties, the authorities considered these as effective tools for restraining excess speculative
demand, but agreed they would consider adjustments in the event of a sustained decline in transaction
volumes with the potential to generate adverse spillovers to the broader economy. On counter-cyclical
macroprudential measures imposed on banks, the authorities observed they will continue to monitor the
property market closely and introduce appropriate measures as and when necessary to safeguard banking

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

29

PEOPLE’S REPUBLIC OF CHINA—HONG KONG SAR

stability. In considering financial stability risks, it is inevitable that broader macro factors would need to be
taken into account.

E. Labor
39.
With the labor force expected to peak within the next 10 years, there is a need to ensure that
dependency burdens remain in check. The proposed Low-income Working Family Allowance is a useful
mechanism to incentivize labor force participation while providing supplementary income to employed
individuals and families with incomes and assets under a certain threshold. The minimum wage, introduced in
2011 and raised twice since then (latest in May 2015), has placed a floor under hourly wages while also
helping to raise participation among segments more distanced from the mainstream labor force. Labor force
participation at the lower end of the income and skills distribution will be further incentivized by regulating
working hours and mandating over-time pay for low-income workers with minimal bargaining power.
Sustained efforts should therefore be made to move forward with legislation on standardizing working hours.
40.
Authorities’ views. The authorities viewed the minimum wage as an important policy tool for
alleviating working poverty. They also regarded it as helping to bring into employment those who might
otherwise be discouraged by the very low wages on offer and not have participated in the labor force.
Increases in employment for female workers have been particularly significant, especially those aged 50 and
above and those in the lower-skilled segment. Income growth in the lowest decile has substantially outpaced
that in other segments ever since the minimum wage was introduced. Together with the Low-Income
Working Family Allowance, a major employment-focused initiative to encourage self-reliance and ease
intergenerational poverty that will take effect from 2016, investment in retraining and retooling early retirees,
and means-tested work transport subsidy, they saw these policies as important levers for encouraging labor
force participation as well as for mitigating the impact of an aging population and shrinking labor force in the
near future.

F. Contingencies for a Perfect Storm
41.
In the low probability event of the perfect storm described above, a comprehensive and coordinated
policy approach involving elements of the 2008/9 response—large and proactive fiscal stimulus; expanded
credit guarantees for SME loans through the Hong Kong Mortgage Corporation—together with loosening of
macroprudential policies would need to be implemented quickly to stem the collapse in confidence,
tightening of liquidity conditions, and steep decline in private sector activity that will likely transpire in such a
scenario. Continued strong collaboration between Hong Kong SAR regulators and counterparts in other
jurisdictions will ensure close monitoring of evolving cross-border risks, and enable the appropriate liquidity
support and backstopping of liabilities needed to limit two-way transmission of financial stress via globally
active intermediaries.
42.
Authorities’ views. The authorities emphasized that protecting jobs is key. A large, pre-emptive fiscal
stimulus together with expansion of SME credit guarantees would be considered to forestall bankruptcies and
safeguard employment. Counter-cyclical macroprudential measures as well as property stamp duties could be
scaled back to ease the pressure on the property market. The authorities also noted that they are actively
participating in supervisory colleges for cross-border banking groups, including G-SIFIs, and cooperating

30

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

PEOPLE’S REPUBLIC OF CHINA—HONG KONG SAR

closely with securities regulators in other jurisdictions to stay abreast of globally active financial institutions’
risk profiles and business strategies.

STAFF APPRAISAL
43.
Growth and resilience. Despite being repeatedly buffeted by powerful global cross-currents, Hong
Kong SAR’s economy has grown steadily in recent years. Real GDP is about 25 percent higher than the global
financial crisis trough in early 2009; employment has expanded close to 9 percent since then, with net job
creation over 300,000; and the unemployment rate has declined to 3.3 percent. The resilience of the economy
and financial system was displayed most recently during the summer months, when markets continued to
function in orderly fashion despite higher volatility in equity prices and currencies after the correction in the
Mainland indices. However, with the external outlook still tentative, growth in Hong Kong SAR will likely
remain subdued below potential in 2015/16.
44.
The main challenges ahead are three-fold. Interest rates—tracking the U.S. Federal fund’s rate—
are set to increase for the first time in seven years. Financial and real activity spillovers from Mainland China
may re-emerge. The run-up in property prices over the past year raises the probability of a correction (with
some signs now evident of a pause in momentum). Overall, considering the strong fiscal and financial buffers
in place in Hong Kong SAR, these risks will likely have limited impact provided (i) interest rates rise at the
modest anticipated pace based on the U.S. Federal Reserve’s FOMC median forecasts for the Federal Funds
rate; and (ii) the ongoing adjustment in Mainland China’s growth remains orderly.
45.
Fiscal policy. If high-frequency indicators in early 2016 point to a significant weakening of activity,
the FY2016/17 budget should proactively provide additional support than currently envisaged, with an
emphasis on expanded relief measures for vulnerable households, small businesses, and accelerated urban
renewal and infrastructure spending where possible.
46.
Long-term fiscal challenges. Beyond cyclical considerations, there is a need to address the
long-term fiscal challenges presented by an aging population and shrinking workforce in the future, as laid
out in the 2014 report by the Working Group on Long-Term Fiscal Planning. Planned initiatives such as the
Low-income Working Family Allowance Scheme will incentivize labor force participation and help mitigate
rising dependency burdens, while the proposed Future Fund will create a mechanism for raising long-term
investment returns of the fiscal reserves, thereby generating additional resources to cope with demographic
change.
47.
Property sector. The government’s reaffirmation through the 2014 Long-Term Housing Strategy to
identify additional housing sites and expand supply will provide respite to affordability concerns over the
medium-term. Sustained efforts should be made to ensure implementation stays on track and the targets are
met. In the interim, the Buyer’s Stamp Duty, Special Stamp Duty and doubled ad valorem stamp duty will help
filter out speculative transactions and restrain excess demand. Adjustments to these duties could be
considered if there is a sustained decline in transactions volumes with the potential to generate adverse
spillovers to the broader economy. Mortgage loan origination standards have been appropriately
strengthened through multiple rounds of macroprudential measures since 2009, encompassing tighter
loan-to-value and debt service-to-income ceilings and risk-weight floors on property loans. These measures
INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

31

PEOPLE’S REPUBLIC OF CHINA—HONG KONG SAR

have limited leveraged exposures to the property price run up without impairing the banking system’s key
function of expanding credit commensurate to the needs of the real economy. The property-related
macroprudential measures should continue to remain in place; any adjustments should be made based on
evolving financial stability risks and not in response to aggregate demand developments (unless the
measures are deemed to impair credit intermediation and disrupt the banking system’s ability to support the
real economy).
48.
Financial sector policies. Hong Kong SAR has a strong track record of filling regulatory and data
gaps, assessing systemic risks, and strengthening financial institutions’ loss absorption buffers in a preemptive
manner. The authorities have also provided infrastructure support for healthy market development, for
instance in offshore RMB services. In line with the recommendations of the 2014 FSAP, important progress
has been made with regard to establishing an independent authority for the insurance sector; crisis
management and recovery plans for financial market infrastructures; and cross-border cooperation across the
banking, insurance, and securities regulators. Areas that warrant further attention include completing the
process underway for enacting legislation on a comprehensive recovery and resolution framework; continuing
to strengthen the oversight regime for securities markets, broker dealers and asset managers as their business
model evolves with new channels connecting Hong Kong SAR and Mainland markets; and fully implementing
a risk-based capital regime for insurance companies.
49.
Exchange rate regime and external position. The LERS remains the best arrangement for Hong
Kong SAR and serves as an anchor of stability for this small open economy with a globally integrated financial
services industry. The smooth functioning of the LERS derives from the robust institutional, legal and policy
framework in place in Hong Kong SAR; the ample fiscal reserves available to cushion the economy from
adverse shocks; the healthy financial system that can accommodate large portfolio adjustments; and, more
generally, flexible asset, goods, and labor markets that can adjust quickly to ensure misalignments in the real
effective exchange rate (REER) do not persist. The external position is broadly consistent with medium term
fundamentals and desirable policies.
50.
Contingencies. The attributes from which Hong Kong SAR’s small open economy derives its
dynamism—an international trading and tourism hub and a premier financial center—also leave it exposed to
global economic forces beyond its control and place a premium on contingency planning. In the low
probability event that a sharper-than-expected slowdown on the Mainland coincides with a turbulent turn in
global financial markets following the Fed liftoff, a range of measures may need to be deployed to forestall a
deep slide in activity in Hong Kong SAR—large and proactive fiscal stimulus; expanded credit guarantees for
SME loans; together with loosening of macroprudential policies. The experience of 2008/09 suggests that a
comprehensive policy response can contain the domestic fallout of a large global shock and quickly set the
economy back on track.
51.
It is recommended that the next Article IV consultation discussions take place on the standard
12-month cycle.

Appendix II. Risk Assessment Matrix1
Overall Level of Concern
Likelihood
(Over next 1–3 years)

Impact and Policy Response

 Sharp asset
price
adjustment and
decompression
of credit
spreads

High
Reassessment of growth
prospects in regions that
Hong Kong SAR financial
center is exposed to
combined with
uncertainties surrounding
Fed policy rate path.

High
The associated volatility surge prompts globally-active institutions to
reduce leverage, maturity transformation, and holdings of risky assets,
resulting in a general tightening of global financing conditions,
amplified by lower market liquidity.

 Disorderly
correction of
housing prices

Medium
Higher global market
volatility and financing cost
resulting from Fed liftoff
lead to an abrupt downturn
in property prices.

Medium
Falling collateral values and negative wealth effect could trigger an
adverse feedback loop between economic activity, bank lending,
household indebtedness, and housing market.

Low
Growth falls significantly
below target, possibly due
to a severe housing
downturn or a shock in the
shadow banking sector,
which triggers financial
stress in Mainland markets
and outward spillovers.

High
Economic activity could weaken significantly with falling trade with the
Mainland. Accompanying financial instability in the Mainland could
result in financial volatility in Hong Kong SAR.

Medium
Maturing of the cycle,
misallocation of investment
and excess corporate
leverage, and insufficient
progress with reforms lead
to significant MT growth
slowdown

Medium

 Sharp China
slowdown in
2015-16

 Structurally
weak growth in
emerging
markets

 Steadfast
implementation
of reforms in
China

Medium
Steadfast implementation
of the third plenum reform
blueprint will lead to
higher-quality and more
sustainable growth in China
over the medium term.

Policy response: Safeguard financial stability through macroprudential
measures and provide liquidity through existing facilities.

Policy response: Adjust macroprudential measures while safeguarding
financial stability. Ensure adequate supply of land and public housing
in the medium term. Deploy fiscal measures, if needed, to support
domestic demand.

Policy response: Deploy fiscal measures to stimulate domestic demand
with emphasis on low-income and vulnerable household while
safeguarding financial stability through macroprudential measures
and liquidity provision. In addition, work closely with Mainland
counterparts to facilitate an orderly resolution of distressed assets and
address any weaknesses in banks’ balance sheets.
Hong Kong SAR’s high degree of openness and position as a financial
center and a trading hub would imply large spillovers from weak
growth in emerging economies’ lower growth. High household
leverage and potential asset price corrections could exacerbate a
slowdown in economic activity.
Policy response: Should domestic demand weaken substantially,
temporary and targeted fiscal stimulus needs to be provided with
continued efforts on medium-term structural reforms.
High
Growth potential for Hong Kong SAR would improve through close
trade and financial links, although growth may slow in the near term.
Policy response: Continue to undertake reforms and investment to
enhance domestic competitiveness, and upgrade public infrastructure
that would provide further synergy to benefit from China’s higherquality growth over the medium term.

The Risk Assessment Matrix (RAM) shows events that could materially alter the baseline path (the scenario most likely to materialize in the
view of IMF staff). The relative likelihood of risks listed is the staff’s subjective assessment of the risks surrounding the baseline (“low” is
meant to indicate a probability below 10 percent, “medium” a probability between 10 and 30 percent, and “high” a probability of 30 percent
or more). The RAM reflects staff views on the source of risks and overall level of concern as of the time of discussions with the authorities.
Nonmutually exclusive risks may interact and materialize jointly.

1/ Public sector is defined as consolidated public sector.
2/ Based on available data. Public debt includes debt identified identified in the consolidated financial statement. It excludes debt issued through the bond fund.
3/ EMBIG.
4/ Defined as interest payments divided by debt stock (excluding guarantees) at the end of previous year.
5/ Derived as [(r - π(1+g) - g + ae(1+r)]/(1+g+π+gπ)) times previous period debt ratio, with r = interest rate; π = growth rate of GDP deflator; g = real GDP growth rate;
a = share of foreign-currency denominated debt; and e = nominal exchange rate depreciation (measured by increase in local currency value of U.S. dollar).
6/ The real interest rate contribution is derived from the numerator in footnote 5 as r - π (1+g) and the real growth contribution as -g.
7/ The exchange rate contribution is derived from the numerator in footnote 5 as ae(1+r).
8/ Includes asset changes and interest revenues (if any). For projections, includes exchange rate changes during the projection period.
9/ Assumes that key variables (real GDP growth, real interest rate, and other identified debt-creating flows) remain at the level of the last projection year.

level

Assessment. The external position is sustainable and expected to follow a path that converges the NFA to
levels broadly in line with the average before the global financial crisis around 200 percent of GDP.
Background. The current account surplus is estimated to be 2.5 percent of GDP in 2015, Although it is
substantially lower than in 2010 (7.0 percent of GDP), it is higher than in 2012 and 2013 (about 1.5 percent of
GDP).
Assessment. The current account is consistent with medium-term fundamentals and desirable policies. Staff
quantitative assessment suggests that the difference between the cyclically-adjusted current account in 2015
and that consistent with fundamentals and desirable policies is between -3 to 3 percent of GDP (EBA-type
results indicate a larger deviation, but are in this case subject to uncertainty and potential biases). 1/
Background. The REER appreciated by about 10 percent by October 2015 relative to the average REER in
2014. The Hong Kong SAR system possesses strong self-equilibrating tendencies, thanks to flexible goods,
factor, and asset markets. Real median monthly earnings have barely increased in the last two years.
Assessment. The real exchange rate is broadly consistent with medium-term fundamentals and desirable
policies. Based on empirical EBA-type estimates and factoring in the uncertainties and variability of an
offshore trading and financial center, the exchange rate is assessed by staff to be from -10 to 10 percent
different from the level consistent with medium-term fundamentals and desirable policies.
Background. As a financial center, Hong Kong SAR has a fully open capital account without capital controls.
The amounts of gross capital inflows and outflows have been large. Hong Kong SAR has experienced net
private inflows in the first half of 2015.
Assessment. Large financial resources and proactive financial supervision and regulation limit the risks from
potential volatile capital flows.
Background. Hong Kong SAR has a currency board arrangement. International reserves have been built up
in a nondiscretionary way as a result of a long-standing commitment to the Linked Exchange Rate System.
The stock of reserves is equivalent to around US$345.8 billion (about 119 percent of 2014 GDP) at Q3:2015.
Assessment. Currently reserves are adequate for precautionary purposes and should continue to evolve in
line with the automatic adjustment inherent in the currency board system. Hong Kong SAR also holds
significant fiscal reserves built up through a track record of strong fiscal discipline.

Overall Assessment:
The external position in 2015 is
broadly consistent with
medium-term fundamentals and
desirable policy settings. The
current account surplus has
declined relative to its pre-2010
level on account of structural
factors, including opening of the
Mainland capital account and
changes in offshore merchandise
trade activities. The impact of
recent REER appreciation is
expected to be offset by Hong
Kong SAR’s strong
self-equilibrating tendencies
resulting from flexible goods,
factor, and asset markets.
Potential policy responses:
Macroeconomic policies are
broadly appropriate. Robust and
proactive financial supervision
and regulation, prudent fiscal
management, flexible markets,
and the Linked Exchange Rate
System have worked well to keep
the external position broadly in
balance. Continuation of these
policies, therefore, will help keep
the external position broadly in
line with medium-term
fundamentals.

Appendix IV. External Sector Report

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

Current
account

Background. Hong Kong SAR has significant net foreign assets of around 330 percent of GDP as of Q2:2015.
Both external financial assets (about 1500 percent of GDP) and liabilities (about 1170 percent of GDP) are
high, reflecting Hong Kong SAR’s status as a major international financial center with considerable
cross-territory investment. The GDP share of net foreign assets is projected to follow a trend that gradually
converges to levels broadly in line with the average prior to the global financial crisis, driven by expected
returns and valuation changes. The trend decline mainly reflects the interest-growth differential—as nominal
GDP is expected to grow faster than the effective returns on NFA (net investment income as a share of NFA).
Given the large gross assets and liabilities, annual fluctuations in NFA due to valuation changes have been
sizable.

External Sector Report (concluded)
Technical
Background
Notes

1/ Hong Kong SAR is not in the EBA sample as it is an outlier along many dimensions of EBA analysis. Taking into
consideration variability of the current account in an international trading and financial center, application of EBA
methodology to Hong Kong SAR’s current account provides a poor fit. The difference between the current account
consistent with fundamentals and desirable policies, and the cyclically-adjusted current account is estimated to be
about 10½ percent of GDP, with EBA regression residual of a similar magnitude and a nearly neutral impact of
combined contributions of policy gaps. The large residual likely reflects a combination of structural factors which
are not captured by EBA and potential bias in point estimates. These structural factors include the ongoing and
expected future opening of the Mainland capital account (which will create more demand for office and residential
space and hence the imports related to construction), the change of offshore merchandise trade activities and the
surge of Mainland tourist spending (which will reduce measured current account surplus if the measured increase
of service credits cannot fully offset the increase of goods imports). The point estimate could also be affected by
the contribution of three variables: aging-related interaction term, NFA position (both sample outliers, which could
bias the results given potential model nonlinearities at extreme values), and financial center dummy (subject to
uncertainty given the small number of financial centers in the sample). Moreover, EBA estimates do not account for
the cyclical impact of low interest rates on investment income, which is sizable given the large share of interestbearing foreign assets.



The Financial Services and the Treasury Bureau (“FSTB”), the Hong Kong Monetary Authority
(“HKMA”), the Securities and Futures Commission (“SFC”) and the Insurance Authority (“IA”) have
reached an advance stage in the development of the draft legislation for the establishment of a
single cross-sector resolution framework in Hong Kong SAR with a view to meeting the standards
set by the Financial Stability Board (FSB)’s Key Attributes of Effective Resolution Regimes for
Financial Institutions (Key Attributes).
The first stage of public consultation was conducted in Q1:2014 followed by a second stage of
public consultation in Q2:2015. Respondents were generally content with the proposed
establishment of the resolution framework.
The consultation response (with refined policy positions on certain aspects) was published on
October 9, 2015. The authorities intend to introduce the Financial Institutions (Resolution) Bill into
the legislature in December 2015.

FMIs under the purview of SFC

It has been agreed that three of the four existing recognized clearing houses (RCH) namely, Hong
Kong Securities Clearing Company Limited, HKFE Clearing Corporation Limited, The SEHK Options
Clearing House Limited, will each develop a recovery plan within the year 2015 for discussion with
the SFC. The recovery plan will take into consideration the guidance on development of recovery
plans for FMIs published by CPMI-IOSCO in October 2014. The fourth RCH, OTC Clearing Hong
Kong Limited, already has a recovery plan.


When the new legislation of the resolution regime comes into effect, SFC will work with the four
RCHs in developing their respective resolution plans.

FMIs under the purview of HKMA

The settlement institutions of the various foreign-currency Real Time Gross Settlement (“RTGS”) systems in
Hong Kong SAR (i.e., U.S. dollar, euro and RMB CHATS), which are commercial banks in Hong Kong, have
developed their recovery plans.

The system operator of the various RTGS systems in Hong Kong SAR, the Hong Kong Interbank Clearing
Limited (“HKICL”), is developing its recovery plan based on the PFMI requirements and aims to finalize it
before end-2015 in accordance with the HKMA’s requirement.

Recommendation

Progress
According to a note issued by CPMI-IOSCO on application of the PFMIs to central bank FMIs, the
requirements to prepare recovery and orderly wind-down plans do not apply to central bank-operated
FMIs. Therefore, the requirement to develop a recovery and resolution plan is not applicable to the Central
Moneymarkets Unit (“CMU”), Hong Kong Dollar Clearing House Automated Transfer System (“CHATS”)
and the Trade Repository (“TR”).

The authorities should ensure
implementation of the
independent Insurance Agency
(IA) as scheduled in 2015.



The Insurance Companies (Amendment) Ordinance 2015 (“Amendment Ordinance”), the enabling
legislation for the establishment of IIA, was enacted on 10 July 2015. It provides that, among other things,
IIA should be independent of the Government and the industry. A Provisional Insurance Authority will be
set up by the end of 2015 to undertake essential preparatory work for taking over the regulatory functions
of the existing IA in about a year.

In addition, the legal and
regulatory framework should be
strengthened



Under the Amendment Ordinance, the appointment of certain individuals by an insurer, including
controllers, directors, key persons in control functions and appointed actuaries, is subject to the prior
approval of IIA. Control functions currently include risk management; financial control; compliance; internal
audit; actuarial and intermediary management functions. To provide flexibility to update the regulatory
regime in light of future developments, the Financial Secretary may specify other control functions through
subsidiary legislation. IIA is also empowered under the Amendment Ordinance to revoke the appointment
of such person on fitness and propriety grounds.



Besides, shareholder controllers will be required to report the disposal of their shareholding interests. IA is
updating the existing Guidance Note (“GN”) on Corporate Governance which, among other things,
includes enhancing requirements for insurers to implement contingency plans in their risk management
process.



Apart from the current role of IA in (i) leading the supervisory college of a Hong Kong SAR incorporated
insurance group; (ii) co-leading a regional supervisory college of a Globally Systematic Important Insurer
with the home regulator; and (iii) actively participating in supervisory colleges of other insurance groups,
IA proposes a regulatory regime for insurance groups and subgroups in the context of developing a
risk-based capital (“RBC”) regime. Consultation with the stakeholders was conducted at the end of 2014.
Depending on the structure and size of insurance groups, a three-tier approach for supervisory measures
for group wide supervision was proposed.

A consultation on the proposed RBC framework was conducted at the end of 2014. The implementation
of the RBC regime will be rolled out in phases. On quantitative requirements (i.e., Pillar 1 under the RBC),
IA, after taking into account feedback from stakeholders, is developing detailed rules and carrying out
quantitative impact studies. Subject to consultation with stakeholders, legislative amendments will be
introduced. The whole process is expected to take about two to three years from now. As regards the
qualitative and disclosure requirements (i.e., Pillars 2 and 3 under RBC), IA will review the relevant GNs and
make revisions ahead of the legislative process as necessary.

(iii) strengthen supervision of
intermediaries.



The Amendment Ordinance sets up a statutory licensing regime for insurance intermediaries and provides
IIA with express powers to conduct inspection, initiate investigation, and impose a range of disciplinary
sanctions (including revocation of license, issuance of reprimand and imposition of pecuniary penalty of
up to HK$10 million) on licensed insurance intermediaries. The broad principles of conduct requirements
on the part of a licensed insurance intermediary are stipulated in the Amendment Ordinance. IIA will also
be empowered to make rules for insurance intermediaries to comply with practices and standards relating
to conduct requirements, and issue codes or guidelines to facilitate their compliance with the conduct
requirements.



As regards conduct of business requirements for insurers, IA has issued two GNs for insurers on the
underwriting of unit-linked policies and life insurance policies respectively, which are based on Insurance
Core Principle 19 on Conduct of Business promulgated by the International Association of Insurance
Supervisors. Both GNs adopts a “cradle-to-grave” approach by requiring insurers to meet regulatory
requirements on product design, disclosure of key product features, suitability assessment as well as sales
and post-sale control measures to ensuring that the products being recommended to clients do suit their
needs.



SFC enhanced its supervisory approach in early 2014 following the announcement by HKEx in
2013 of its strategic plan which would change its business model as it expands into new markets,
asset classes and infrastructures. Supervision focused on HKEx’s capability to adequately identify,
assess, and manage conflicts, business and regulatory compliance risks across the markets in which
HKEx operates, and on conducting on-site inspections of the non-listing operations of HKEx. In this
regard–

SFC is updating its Guidelines for the Regulation of Automated Trading Services (“ATS Guidelines”,
first published in 2003) to incorporate requirements for the upcoming authorization of overseas
CCPs under the Over-the-Counter (“OTC”) derivatives regulatory regime. The revised ATS
Guidelines include guidelines that explain the differences between the regulatory regime for the
recognition of exchanges and the authorization of ATS. The explanation will facilitate understanding
of the regulatory differences (which are reflected in SFO) and guide potential applicants when
choosing between recognition as a recognized exchange company (“REC”) or an authorization as a
Part III ATS. SFC intends to consult the market on the proposed changes by end-2015.
FSTB launched a public consultation to solicit views on proposals to introduce an independent
oversight regime for the regulation of listed entity auditors in June 2014. The consultation conclusions
were issued in June 2015 (http://www.fstb.gov.hk/fsb/ppr/consult/doc/conclu_rpirrlea_e.pdf).
With general support from the audit profession and the relevant stakeholders, the Government is
preparing an amendment bill to implement the reform. The reform will bring Hong Kong SAR in line
with the international standards that auditor regulatory regimes should be independent of the
profession itself and be subject to independent oversight by bodies acting in the public interest. The
Government’s target is to introduce the amendment bill into the Legislative Council in the 2016–17
legislative session.



Under the reform proposals, the Financial Reporting Council (“FRC”) will become the independent auditor
oversight body vested with direct inspection, investigation and disciplinary powers with regard to listed
entity auditors. The enforcement powers to be vested with FRC will also be stronger as compared with the
present regime. Without compromising the independence of the new auditor regulatory regime, the
authorities will leverage of the experience of the Hong Kong Institute of Certified Public Accountants
(“HKICPA”) in handling registration, standard setting and continuing professional development-related
matters by entrusting the Institute with these statutory functions but subject to the oversight by FRC.



Since the Securities and Futures Ordinance came into operation in 2003, the enforcement approach
(including imposition of punitive, deterrent sanctions and remediation to victims) of SFC has been
proven to be effective in ensuring that the markets SFC regulates are safe, fair and efficient. In view
of the ever-evolving market situation, FSTB will continue to work with SFC for continual
improvement to minimize financial crimes and market misconduct, uphold market integrity and
inspire confidence of investors.



SFC is continuing its discussion with the Department of Justice (“DoJ”) on a new protocol for the
exercise of prosecution powers.



SFC and HKEx have agreed on a timetable for the recognized clearing houses in the HKEx Group to
comply with the PFMIs in respect of areas where improvements are required. Most of the areas identified
will be addressed by the end of 2015, while a few will require legislative amendments or further study for
implementation.



HKMA revised its Policy Statement on oversight of financial market infrastructures (FMIs) on
January 9, 2014. The revised Statement requires, among other things, that FMIs under the purview of the
HKMA (including the Hong Kong dollar, U.S. dollar, euro and RMB CHATS, CMU and HKTR) should have
made changes to conform with relevant requirements in the PFMIs, and be generally observant of the
PFMIs by December 31, 2015. The CMU, Hong Kong dollar CHATS and TR have all completed a selfassessment on their compliance with the PFMIs, and the disclosure framework for them was first published
in October 2014, July 2014 and September 2015 respectively.

Systemic risk
analysis

Recommendation
Strengthening the capacity for
systemic risk analysis at the SFC
and the IA would help ensure
that cross-sectoral
interconnections are adequately
captured and brought to the
attention of the Financial
Stability Committee (“FSC”).

Progress
SFC has commenced a review of its long-term risk data strategy focusing on identifying data that can be
collected in a methodological fashion and that may contribute to the early identification of systemic risk, as
well as to the setting of strategic, policy and supervisory priorities.



To enhance existing macroprudential surveillance and support policymaking, IA is taking steps to improve
its data infrastructure by requiring insurers to provide IA with additional information on risk exposures and
interconnections, which will facilitate the assessment of the build-up of risks/vulnerabilities to the industry.
For example, with the G20/FSB recommendations and initiatives on macroprudential oversight on shadow
banking, IA has been working towards the development of more robust quantitative indicators for
assessing the systemic risk of insurers. In this annual exercise, IA collects from insurers data about their
financial assets by categories and their shadow banking activities. This is also conducted by HKMA, SFC
and Mandatory Provident Fund Authority at the same time, with specific shadow banking indicators
pertinent to their respective businesses.



Life insurers are required to conduct periodic industry-wide standardized scenario testing as and when
required, to enable IA to assess the existence of any vulnerabilities within the industry. On a regular basis,
insurers are required to submit the results of Dynamic Solvency Testing under adverse scenarios to IA
which uses the information to perform industry-wide resilience tests on a quarterly basis. IA also performs
analysis of the asset mix of life insurers to assess their concentration risks and the exposure to different
sectors. On the information exchange front, IA provides HKMA with statistics of insurers associated with
banking groups to enable the latter to perform its role in macroprudential surveillance.



Besides, IA has been collecting business statistics from insurers and calculating industry-wide claims ratios
for specified lines of business. IA also collects burning cost data from the industry. Such information would
be used as the reference to test the adequacy of technical provisions for specific lines of business of
individual insurers.



As for the macroprudential surveillance from a cross-sectoral perspective, IA liaises with other local financial
regulators (such as HKMA and SFC) regularly via the Council of Financial Regulators (“CFR”) and FSC on
supervisory and regulatory issues with cross-market implications. CFR and FSC deliberate on events, issues
and developments with possible cross-market and systemic implications. A review would be taken by the
financial regulators if any significant risk area of the financial markets is identified.

Membership Status
As a Special Administrative Region of the People’s Republic of China, Hong Kong SAR is not a
member of the Fund. However, annual consultation discussions have been held with the
Hong Kong SAR authorities since October 1990, and the staff also holds discussions with the
authorities in connection with the Fund’s Global Financial Stability reports. STA has provided
Hong Kong SAR with technical assistance in the area of balance of payments statistics and
Hong Kong SAR officials have attended IMF Institute courses on balance of payments and monetary
statistics, and financial programming. The latest FSAP was undertaken in 2014 at the request of the
authorities.
Exchange Rate Arrangement
The Hong Kong dollar has been linked to the U.S. dollar under a currency board arrangement, the
Linked Exchange Rate System (LERS), since October 1983 at a rate of HK$7.8/US$1. The Hong Kong
Monetary Authority (HKMA) refined the operations of the LERS in May 2005—the first changes since
September 1998. For the first time since the introduction of the LERS in 1983, the HKMA explicitly
committed to sell Hong Kong dollar at a preannounced price (set at HK$7.75/US$), which is referred
to as the strong-side convertibility undertaking. Previously, the HKMA had only committed to buy
Hong Kong dollar at a preannounced rate (the weak-side convertibility undertaking introduced in
October 1998) and could sell Hong Kong dollar at any price. Along with this two-way convertibility

STATISTICAL ISSUES
Data provision is adequate for surveillance purposes. Hong Kong SAR provides statistics to the Fund
on a timely basis for surveillance and publication in the International Financial Statistics (IFS).
Hong Kong SAR subscribes to the Fund’s Special Data Dissemination Standard and is fully compliant
with its requirements.
Hong Kong SAR publishes comprehensive balance of payments data and international investment
position statistics for 2000 onwards, and also publishes quarterly external debt statistics according to
the recommendations given in the External Debt Statistics: Guide for Compilers and Users.
Hong Kong SAR reports both cash and accrual-based annual data for the general government
according to the Fund’s Government Finance Statistics Manual (GFSM 1986 and GFSM 2001,
respectively). No subannual data are provided for publication in the IFS.
Hong Kong SAR participates in regular reporting of Financial Soundness Indicators (FSIs) to the IMF for
dissemination. The reported data are quarterly and cover all core FSIs and 12 additional FSIs for the
deposit takers sector.
In late 2009, the HKMA began reporting quarterly monetary data using Standardized Report Forms
(SRFs) that present data consistent with the Monetary and Financial Statistics Manual. However, the
SRF data for Hong Kong SAR have not been published in IFS, which uses monthly data periodicity.

Statement by the Staff Representative on
People’s Republic of China—Hong Kong Special Administrative Region
January 11, 2016
1.
This statement contains information that has become available since the staff
report was circulated to the Executive Board on December 16, 2015. It does not alter the
staff’s broad assessment of policy issues and recommendations contained in the report nor
does it alter the staff appraisal.
2.
Data releases for November continue to be in line with staff projections. The
labor market continued to hold up (employment rose 0.2 percent m/m; the unemployment
rate remained at 3.3 percent; real wages rose 2.3 percent y/y in the third quarter) even as
retail sales softened (down 3.1 percent m/m) on the back of slower tourist traffic (declined
3.9 percent m/m). CPI inflation remained at 2.4 percent (y/y). Bank credit outstanding
increased slightly by 0.1 percent m/m, while RMB deposits rose by 1.2 percent (m/m).
3.
On December 17, the HKMA raised its Base Rate. The interest rate—which is an
input used for calculating the Discount Rates for repurchase transactions through the
Discount Window—was adjusted upward by 25 basis points to 0.75 percent following the
U.S. Fed’s decision to raise the target range for the Federal Funds rate by a quarter
percentage point on December 16.
4.
On December 18, the Government announced the establishment of the Future
Fund with effect from January 1, 2016. It aims to secure higher investment returns for the
fiscal reserves. The initial endowment of HK$219.7 billion amounts to about 25 percent of
the overall fiscal reserves (or about 9 percent of GDP) and the Government may provide
periodic top-ups in the future. About 50 percent of the Future Fund will be set aside for
incremental placement with the HKMA’s Exchange Fund's Long-Term Growth Portfolio,
which includes private equities and investments in properties outside Hong Kong SAR. The
rest will be placed with the Exchange Fund's investment portfolio or other investment assets.
The Future Fund will be subject to oversight by the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee.
Separately, the HKMA should consult the Financial Secretary and the Secretary for Financial
Services and the Treasury once a year on the asset allocation for the Future Fund.
Withdrawal of the Future Fund before December 31, 2025, is not allowed except in
emergencies. Expenditure from the Future Fund would require approval of the Legislative
Council under the existing legislation.

Statement by Mr. Zhongxia Jin, Executive Director, Mr. Ping Sun, Alternate Executive
Director, and Mr. Raymond Yuen, Advisor to the Executive Director
January 11, 2016
On behalf of the Hong Kong SAR authorities, we would like to thank staff for the candid and
constructive discussions held during the mission, which focused on the economic outlook,
risks and opportunities, and the appropriate policy response to these developments. There is
broad agreement between staff and the authorities on these issues, and we welcome staff’s
recognition of the authorities’ efforts in enhancing the economic and financial resilience of
Hong Kong SAR.
Latest economic development and outlook
The Hong Kong SAR economy continued to grow at a moderate pace. Overall, the real GDP
growth rate remained stable at 2.5 percent year-on-year in the first three quarters of 2015—
about the same as in 2014. Domestic demand held up well on the back of steady job and
income conditions, while external demand weakened alongside the global trade slowdown
and weaker tourism inflows. Nevertheless, there are indications that real activity has
moderated in recent months amidst the continued drag of the external headwinds. Given the
outturn in the first three quarters, the authorities expect the full-year real GDP growth rate to
be 2.4 percent in 2015, slightly higher than staff’s forecast of 2.25 percent.
Inflation stayed on an easing trend, with the year-on-year underlying consumer price
inflation rate softening to 2.5 percent in the first three quarters of 2015, as compared to
3.5 percent in 2014. This largely reflected weaker international commodity prices and more
moderate increases in domestic wages and rentals. With the ongoing slowdown in inflation
momentum, the authorities agree with staff that consumer price inflation is likely to remain
benign in the near term.
We note staff’s projection for Hong Kong SAR’s economic growth to pick up slightly to 2.5
percent in 2016. While downside risks are also identified, including rising interest rates in the
United States, possible price correction in the domestic property market, and exposure to
stress in Mainland China, staff’s assessment suggests that they would be manageable,
considering the strong buffers already in place in Hong Kong SAR and the authorities’
proactive efforts to contain such risks from developing or their spillovers. The authorities
will nevertheless stay vigilant to these developments and, in case such risks materialize, will
take all necessary actions in a timely manner to safeguard the macroeconomic and financial
stability of Hong Kong SAR.
Linked Exchange Rate System
The authorities welcome staff’s continued support for the Linked Exchange Rate System

2
(LERS) and their balanced assessment of Hong Kong SAR’s external position. The LERS
has served Hong Kong SAR well as an anchor of monetary and financial stability and has
proved to be highly resilient in a series of severe domestic and global strains, including the
heightened regional financial stress last summer. The authorities are fully committed to the
LERS, which remains the most appropriate exchange rate arrangement given the small and
open nature of the Hong Kong SAR economy and its role as an international financial center.
The preconditions for smooth functioning of the LERS—robust institutional, legal, and
policy framework, prudent fiscal management, a healthy financial system, and the requisite
economic flexibility—are all fully in place.
Property market
After a prolonged period of buoyancy, the residential property market showed signs of
consolidation in recent months, with house prices moving downward modestly and
transaction volume staying subdued. The adjustment has been gradual and orderly,
contributing to a more healthy development of the property market. However, it is worth
noting that households’ pent-up demand remains strong relative to new supply, and mortgage
rates continue to stay low in Hong Kong SAR even after the Fed liftoff in December. With
that, it remains appropriate for the authorities to uphold the stamp duty measures to cool off
speculative transactions and restrain excess demand. On the countercyclical macroprudential
measures, the authorities agree with staff that bank and household leverage exposures have
been by and large limited, while substantial buffers are in place to guard against adverse
outcomes. The authorities will continue to keep a close eye on developments in the property
market and deploy appropriate measures based on evolving macroeconomic and financial
stability risks facing Hong Kong SAR.
The authorities remain determined to alleviate housing affordability concerns by raising flat
supply, which is important for the healthy and stable development of the property market
over the medium to longer term. The Long Term Housing Strategy laid out the target of
producing an annual average of about 48,000 units in the coming ten years from FY2015/16
to FY2024/25, or about double the annual average produced in recent years. To this end, the
authorities will continue to expedite the process of identifying new housing sites and increase
residential land supply. On public housing, the authorities have recently set aside a Housing
Reserve fund to ensure adequate funding to meet the long-term supply target.
Fiscal policy
Hong Kong SAR’s fiscal position is strong, with the fiscal balance already in surplus for
twelve straight years, lifting the fiscal reserves to 36 percent of GDP at the end of
FY2014/15. As also noted in the staff report, this provides sufficient space for the authorities
to roll out counter-cyclical macro relief when needed. It should be stressed that this fiscal
space is built upon prudent fiscal management. With that, the authorities will continue to

3
uphold fiscal discipline to ensure sustainability of public finance, and fiscal strategies will be
formulated with due consideration of the economic environment and the needs of Hong Kong
SAR.
To help address the long-term fiscal challenges of an aging population and shrinking
workforce, the authorities have earmarked part of the fiscal reserves and a portion of future
budget surpluses to establish a Future Fund. This Future Fund, with an initial endowment of
HK$219.7 billion, will be placed in long-term investments to achieve higher returns within
acceptable risk levels, thereby generating additional resources to cope with demographic
change.
Financial sector
The authorities are glad to see staff’s assessment that Hong Kong SAR’s regulatory and
supervisory framework is a global standard setter. Local banks are found well capitalized
with no liquidity shortage, and asset quality is sound by international standards. Indeed, the
authorities have taken multiple steps over the past few years to enhance banks’ credit and
liquidity risk management, strengthen their shock absorbent buffers, and limit their leverage
exposures. After the last Article IV consultation in May 2014, the authorities refined the
Stable Funding Requirement to further strengthen banks’ liquidity management and help
mitigate the potential impact of financial market fluctuations. Another round of propertyrelated macroprudential tightening measures was introduced. The implementation of the
second phase of the Basel III standards also commenced, with the rules on capital buffers and
liquidity coverage ratio taking effect from 2015, followed by a loss absorbency capital
surcharge for domestically systematic important banks and the phasing in of a
countercyclical capital buffer in 2016.
Growth in Mainland-related lending of the Hong Kong SAR banking sector is a natural
consequence of the growth of the Mainland economy and development of Mainland
corporates. The authorities are fully aware of this trend and have proactively stepped up the
monitoring of banks’ business in this area, including more frequent regular and thematic
on-site examinations, and more comprehensive and granular reviews and analyses. Based on
the outcome of these on-site examinations and off-site reviews, the credit risks of the banking
sector in Hong Kong SAR are found properly managed. Banks and their Mainland
subsidiaries have maintained high underwriting standards and properly managed the
concentration risk. Asset quality remains healthy, with the classified loan ratio of
Mainland-related lending portfolio staying low at 0.49 percent as of end-June 2015. The
authorities however recognize that there is no room for complacency, and they will continue
with their supervisory efforts to ensure that banks will uphold their credit underwriting
standards and prudently manage their liquidity risks.

4
The authorities also strive to make important progress in enhancing the regulatory and
supervisory framework along the recommendations of the 2014 Financial Sector Assessment
Program (FSAP). In particular, the legislation for establishing an independent Insurance
Authority was enacted in July 2015, bringing significant changes to insurance regulation in
Hong Kong SAR, including paving the way for a risk-based capital regime. Meanwhile, the
legislative process on an effective recovery and resolution framework for financial
institutions in Hong Kong SAR has been under way, with the first reading of the Financial
Institutions (Resolution) Bill in the Legislative Council in December 2015.
Offshore renminbi business
The expanding use of renminbi globally and the progressive financial liberalization
undertaken by Mainland China have provided further impetus for the development of Hong
Kong SAR’s offshore renminbi business. Since late 2014, the Mainland authorities have
implemented a number of important financial liberalization measures, including the
Shanghai-Hong Kong Stock Connect and Mainland-Hong Kong Mutual Recognition of
Funds schemes. The authorities also relaxed the rules on cross-border renminbi cash pooling
by multinational corporates, introduced measures to allow offshore banks to conduct repos in
the Mainland interbank bond market, and gave foreign central banks, sovereign wealth funds,
and supranational organizations more access to the Mainland interbank bond and foreign
exchange markets. These moves have led to further development of cross-border and
offshore renminbi businesses. During the year, the offshore renminbi market in Hong Kong
SAR continued to function in an orderly manner, and some business areas such as trade
settlement and bank lending saw steady growth. Hong Kong SAR also remained as a premier
global renminbi payment and settlement hub, with the average daily turnover of its renminbi
Real Time Gross Settlement system reaching above RMB900 billion.
Looking ahead, the Chinese government’s firm commitment to economic reforms should
take the Mainland economy on a robust and sustainable growth path in the medium and
longer term, to the benefit of Hong Kong SAR and the global economy. The authorities
expect that offshore renminbi business in Hong Kong SAR will continue to grow, supported
by the expanding use of renminbi globally and the progressive financial liberalization by the
Mainland authorities.
