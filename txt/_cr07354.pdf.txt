Staff Report for the 2007 Article IV Consultation1

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

Background. Angola’s economy has been strong in recent years, thanks to robust
growth in both the oil and non-oil sectors. Meanwhile, inflation has fallen, and surging
oil revenues have led to large fiscal and external current account surpluses.
Key issues and recommendations

1

•

Outlook. Near-term prospects are positive. Real GDP growth in 2007 is projected
to be about 24 percent as oil production from new oil fields comes on stream and
the non-oil sector continues to expand. Growth in the medium term will rely
increasingly on the non-oil sector, where reforms to promote private sector
development will be critical to offset a potential loss in competitiveness from an
appreciating real exchange rate.

•

Fiscal policy. A key challenge is to ensure that political pressure to scale up public
spending does not undermine macroeconomic stability. Staff recommend that
policies should be framed in a medium-term context, with a target path for the nonoil primary fiscal deficit and a conservative oil price rule. Priority should also be
given to strengthening public financial management and transparency. The
authorities have been using a conservative oil price in the budget, and with regard
to oil sector transparency, they have improved oil bidding practices.

•

Monetary and exchange rate policies. Recent tightening of monetary policy and
exchange rate adjustments will help toward achieving the authorities’ inflation
objectives. The exchange rate regime is a conventional peg, but the exchange rate
appears to be broadly in line with its equilibrium value.

•

Debt sustainability. Angola has a moderate risk of debt distress. Lower output
growth and oil revenues than envisaged in the baseline scenario could jeopardize
public and external debt sustainability. The authorities will need flexible debt,
international reserves, and exchange rate policies to counter this risk.

The mission visited Luanda May 24–June 6, 2007, and comprised Mr. McDonald (head), Mr. Kovanen, and
Mr. Kyei (all AFR), Ms. Daban-Sanchez (FAD), and Mr. Tzanninis (PDR). The mission met with Mr. de Morais,
Minister of Finance, Mr. Mauricio, Governor of the National Bank of Angola, other ministers and senior
government officials, and members of the donor community.

I. INTRODUCTION
1.
Angola’s main socioeconomic challenges are to ease its deeply entrenched poverty
and promote non-oil private sector growth. A long civil war that ended in 2002 left Angola
with pressing infrastructure and socioeconomic demands. Current growth prospects offer an
opportunity to implement reforms to address these challenges. Parliamentary elections in 2008
and presidential elections in 2009 are important steps in democratizing the country and
furthering economic reforms. The discussions focused on measures to consolidate
macroeconomic gains and meet these challenges while keeping fiscal balances and debt
sustainable.
II. RECENT ECONOMIC PERFORMANCE

Angola’s recent macroeconomic performance has been strong (Text Figure 1).
Output growth has been robust since 2001 both in the oil and non-oil sectors.2 Real growth

Angola has made impressive progress in reducing inflation since the end of the war
(Text Figure 2). In 2006 inflation fell from 19 percent to 12 percent, albeit shy of the
government’s year-end inflation target

In late 2006 and early
2007 Angola paid the bulk of its principal and interest arrears (US$2.3 billion) to Paris
Club creditors. Angola plans to pay the rest (US$49 million) in 2007 and has begun making
payments on maturities falling due. Still outstanding is the issue of overdue interest (about
US$1.5 billion), for which Angola is seeking favorable treatment from the Paris Club. The
external debt-to-GDP ratio declined from 40 percent in 2005 to about 20 percent in 2006.
III. CONSOLIDATING MACROECONOMIC STABILITY AND FISCAL TRANSPARENCY
8.
Angola faces three main macroeconomic challenges: (1) managing its oil wealth
before oil production begins to decline to ensure long-term fiscal and debt sustainability;
(2) improving its economic competitiveness; and (3) developing its non-oil/nonextractive
economy. The authorities’ broad objectives, as reflected in the government’s program for
2007–08, underscore the need to consolidate macroeconomic and price stability, support
private sector activities, and deepen reforms of public administration, the financial sector, and
the legal system.4
A. Macroeconomic Objectives
9.
Economic prospects, especially in the near term, are positive (Table 1). Staff
expects real GDP growth to average 25 percent per year in 2007–08, as oil production from
new oil fields comes on stream and the agriculture, manufacturing, construction, and power
sectors expand. The authorities project higher growth in 2007 because they expect oil output to
increase to 2 million barrels per day sooner in 2007.
10.
A rapid scaling up of expenditure could ease infrastructure constraints, but policy
choices will significantly impact macroeconomic prospects. Without attention to capacity

for 2007–08.”

6
and productivity, scaling up could put upward pressure on prices and the exchange rate,
leading to a loss of competitiveness. This would further undermine the growth of the
nonextractive sector and its potential to drive growth and generate jobs once the oil industry
matures. A weaker revenue base would jeopardize long-term fiscal sustainability.
11.
The baseline scenario assumes that government expenditures are consistent with
permanent income from oil revenue (Text Table 1). This scenario, which assumes the
authorities pursue prudent macroeconomic policies and develop a strong track record of
implementing structural reforms, keeps fiscal deficits sustainable in the long run. Output
growth in the oil sector would plateau around 2010 and then gradually decline;5 while non-oil
sector growth, meanwhile, would support average real growth of 7–8 percent in 2008–12.
Inflation would fall to single digits in 2008 before declining further in the medium term. The
external current account surplus would begin to narrow once oil exports peak in 2010, and
move to a deficit in the medium term.6 In line with the weakening external current account, the
real exchange rate is projected to depreciate after an initial appreciation. The non-oil primary
fiscal deficit, as a percent of non-oil GDP, would fall to about 25 percent of non-oil GDP by
2012 (the non-oil primary deficit, in U.S. dollar terms, would stay broadly constant). This
would allow real expenditure to increase by 4 percent per annum during 2007–12.
12.
The authorities agreed with the merits of pursuing strong policies, as outlined in
the baseline. It would reduce the risk of future policy interruptions to ensure long-term fiscal
sustainability. Notwithstanding, there are important risks surrounding the baseline. In
particular, the authorities face significant political pressures to deliver a “peace dividend” to
the public in the form of improved social services and better infrastructure.
13.
The alternative scenario is designed to illustrate the consequences of frontloaded
infrastructure and social spending. This scenario encompasses incomplete structural reforms
and thereby highlights the risks posed if policies are not adjusted to ensure long-term fiscal
sustainability. With the gradual implementation of structural reform, scaled-up fiscal spending
would spur growth in the short term, as investments and real incomes increase. However, it
would also fan inflation and put upward pressure on the real exchange rate. Along with
incomplete structural reforms, these factors would limit growth in the nonextractive traded
goods sector. To the extent that frontloaded government spending fails to generate higher
productivity, public sector savings would be lower and the non-oil primary fiscal deficit wider
than in the baseline. In the medium to long run, these effects would reduce fiscal space,
increase the economy’s vulnerability to oil revenue swings, and push public sector debt to
unsustainable levels (see ¶28).

Oil production is projected to decline by about 4 percent per year in 2020 and later decades.

Box 1. Simulating the Impact of Scaled-Up Public Spending
The alternative scenario in Text Table 1 is based on a simple financial programming model to
scale up public spending to promote growth and reduce poverty. The quantity theory of money and
the relationship between non-oil imports and the real exchange rate guide the model’s dynamics. Shortrun dynamics are determined by the slope of the aggregate supply curve and shifts in aggregate demand,
which are proxied by changes in broad money. Medium-term dynamics are determined by shifts in
aggregate supply, arising from the marginal product of capital, the composition of public spending,
absorptive capacity, and the productivity impact of structural reforms.
Fiscal spending increases by 10 percentage points of non-oil GDP a year in 2007–12 relative to the
baseline. Half the additional spending is directed to infrastructure; a fourth goes to education and
another fourth to health. Half the liquidity impact is sterilized in equal measure with the sales of BNA
bills and foreign exchange.
It is assumed that the import content of government spending is 50 percent for infrastructure,
25 percent for health, and 15 percent for education. Higher import content for infrastructure could be
justified if more capital-intensive projects are pursued. The medium-term return on investment is
cautiously set at 5 percent given Angola’s postconflict status and in line with the existing literature.
However, to reach this return structural reforms must be implemented so that the non-oil sector will
expand as assumed in the baseline. Without such reforms, productivity and output growth in the non-oil
sector would fall short. The lags on return to investment are assumed to be two years for infrastructure,
five years for health, and seven years for education. The import elasticity is assumed at 0.4.1

Bank (Washington).

B. Policy Discussions
Fiscal policy
14.
Staff urged the authorities to limit the non-oil primary deficit in the 2007 budget
at below 60 percent of non-oil GDP (Table 2). If the budget is fully implemented, it would
raise the non-oil primary balance to 66 percent of non-oil GDP. 7 Staff believes that
containing fiscal spending is a feasible objective because the authorities are unlikely to raise
capital spending by 75 percent to 14.5 percent of GDP as budgeted. It would be more
consistent with the government’s inflation target of 10 percent. Staff also urged the
government to contain fuel subsidies by better targeting their utilization. While agreeing with
staff that implementing an ambitious capital budget would be difficult, the authorities argued
that they were under immense political pressure to show a peace dividend.

7

The non-oil primary balance is defined as non-oil revenue minus total expenditure excluding interest outlays.

9
15.
Staff supported the government’s recent practice of adopting a conservative oilprice rule in the budget to guide expenditures. It recommended that the authorities anchor
fiscal policies to a declining trend for the non-oil primary deficit as a percent of non-oil GDP.
In staff’s view, the non-oil primary fiscal deficit should narrow by about 25 percentage points
of non-oil GDP by 2012 to be consistent with medium-term fiscal and debt sustainability.
When an oil-price fiscal rule is combined with a medium-term fiscal framework, it would help
allocate finite oil revenues over a longer period and expenditure targets can be adjusted as oil
revenue fluctuates. The authorities noted, however, that strict adherence to the non-oil
primary fiscal deficit rule would limit their ability to implement the capital budget. Staff
responded that up-front spending could be provided for with a gradual transition to a
sustainable non-oil primary fiscal position.
16.
Mechanisms used in other countries, such as oil funds and budgetary oil price
rules, could help Angola save oil revenues. The Council of Ministers in 2006 adopted a
reserve fund for the difference between the world price for Angola’s oil and the budgeted
price (US$45 in 2007).8 Setting an oil price in the budget is attractive because it is easy to
explain to the public and provides an effective and transparent way to limit policymakers’
discretion. However, staff noted that international experience suggest that oil funds using
rigid operational rules can complicate fiscal management, and therefore emphasis should be
on the establishment of a medium-term fiscal framework to guide policy. Under such a
framework, staff argued that an oil fund that is based on well-defined flexible rules and fully
integrated into the budget process, and buttressed by stringent procedures to ensure
transparency could be considered and would promote the strengthening of public financial
management (PFM) systems. Specifying a long-run oil price could be difficult.
Public financial management
17.
While Angola has improved its PFM systems, further progress to strengthen it is
warranted. It would help strengthen budgeting and its monitoring. The most successful
initiative on PFM and fiscal transparency has been the government’s information system,
SIGFE. It covers all provinces and has helped strengthen budget execution and reporting, and
information sharing on PFM issues. The SIGFE will be extended in 2007 to include some
autonomous bodies and new modules. Its effectiveness, however, is limited because foreign
credit lines and the state-owned oil company’s (Sonangol) large quasi-fiscal activities are not
executed through the SIGFE.9 With the help of external consultants, the government is
implementing several projects to improve PFM and fiscal transparency, including an Oil

8

The authorities reserve fund is not a traditional oil fund and does not have explicit rules for its operations.

Main quasi-fiscal activities of Sonangol include the distribution of subsidized petroleum products, the service
of oil-backed loans, and the provision of fuel to public entities on a nonremunerated basis. These activities are
offset against Sonangol’s oil revenue due to the government on a monthly basis according to a noncash and
cumbersome procedure that gives rise to frequent disputes and large swings in arrears vis-à-vis the treasury.

10
Revenue Forecasting Model, and a comprehensive macro-fiscal database. Tax policy reforms
have been limited and the joint private-public sector commission on tax reform created in
2004 has not received adequate support.
18.
The authorities should move to a multi-year fiscal expenditure framework
(MTFF). A fully fledged MTFF would reorient budgets away from annual targets toward
long-term fiscal goals. Together with the PRSP, which the authorities are updating, and an
appropriate functional budget classification, the MTFF would help guide discussions with line
ministries on how to prioritize spending requests over the medium term. It would also help
identify the implications of policy decisions (such as the possible recurrent costs of capital
spending), and help the authorities strike the right balance between consumption, investing in
physical assets, and accumulation of net financial assets.
19.
Prudent management of Angola’s natural resources requires that measures to
strengthen governance and transparency in the oil and diamond sectors take priority.
This would further enhance macroeconomic management. The authorities have carried out
some of the measures in the Oil Diagnostic Study issued in 2004. However, they noted that
further steps to strengthen governance need to be reassessed because of changes in the oil
industry.
20.
The authorities broadly agree with the recommendations of both the 2004 World
Bank Public Expenditure Management and Financial Accountability Review
(PEMFAR) and the 2006 fiscal ROSC. However, they stressed that institutional and legal
constraints have limited their progress in phasing out the quasi-fiscal activities of Sonangol
and the separation of its concessionaire and commercial roles. Furthermore, they questioned
the merits of joining the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative, in part because oil
companies have positively assessed Angola’s bidding practices (Table 3).
Monetary and exchange rate policies
21.
Recent monetary policy tightening should help contain the rise in consumer
prices. The BNA raised its rediscount rate from 14 percent to 18 percent in May 2007 and
revised the assets eligible for required reserves (within an unchanged total required reserve
target). These measures have increased commercial bank interest rates and facilitated a step
revaluation of the kwanza. The BNA has continued active sterilization operations in 2007 to
contain monetary growth. The recent exchange rate adjustment demonstrated the central
bank’s willingness to allow more flexibility in the exchange rate. Going forward, the BNA
should continue targeting of a monetary aggregate to achieve the inflation target for the year,
while allowing flexibility in the exchange rate.
22.
The authorities agreed that a money-based framework would need to be
pragmatic in the face of volatile money velocity and extensive dollarization of the

11
economy. There is analytical support for targeting a narrow measure of money to reduce
inflation.10 However, because the economy is so dollarized and money velocity difficult to
predict, the choice of the intermediate policy target would need to be evaluated continuously
to ensure its relevance. The authorities agreed that it would be appropriate for the BNA to set
a target range for a monetary aggregate rather than target an absolute value. The BNA should
also consider monitoring a broad set of inflation indicators (such as foreign currency notes in
circulation) to support its monetary target range. The authorities concurred that it would be
premature to adopt the interest rate as an operating variable until the financial markets
become deeper and more efficient. Excess liquidity and rigidities in the Angolan economy
would also complicate the use of interest rates as operating targets.
23.
To complement their efforts to reduce inflation, the monetary authorities should
increase exchange rate flexibility. The central bank intervened heavily in the foreign
exchange market in 2006, and the exchange rate against the U.S. dollar remained constant at
Kz 80 per US$1 throughout the year. The Fund has thus reclassified the exchange rate regime
as a conventional peg. The authorities noted that while they do indeed manage the exchange
rate, they do not hold it to a predetermined path, and would allow the rate to adjust if
conditions warranted. After the monetary tightening, Angola’s currency appreciated, and the
exchange rate fell to Kz 75 per US$1 at the end of May 2007.
24.
Further exchange rate flexibility would be the preferred way to cope with
potential upward pressures on the real exchange rate. By the staff’s analysis, the current
exchange rate is close to its

surpluses emerge (though poor
data quality and economic and
political instability call for caution in interpreting these results). In that case, a more flexible
exchange rate would facilitate the needed adjustment, which in the past primarily took place
through higher domestic inflation, and would help the economy withstand negative shocks
(such as a decline in oil prices).

Staff urged the BNA to develop domestic money, foreign exchange, and capital
markets to enhance monetary policy transmission. Drawing on the advice of the IMF
Department of Monetary and Capital Markets (MCM), the authorities should strengthen
BNA’s capital base, including through the issuance of treasury bills. Staff also emphasized the
importance of the Development Bank, which was set up in 2006 but has yet to begin its
operations. The bank will receive 5 percent of oil and 2 percent of diamond revenues to
finance its lending, which could also be channeled through commercial banks. The staff
underscored the importance of instituting strong management structures to safeguard prudent
lending policies while limiting subsidies. The central bank should also continue strengthening
its analytical capacity and on- and off-site monitoring of banks consistent with MCM advice.
A Financial Sector Assessment Program mission, planned for FY2008, will help the
authorities develop a financial sector strategy.
External sector policies
26.
Staff urged Angola to eliminate outstanding restrictions to prepare for the
acceptance of the obligations under the Fund Article VIII, Sections 2 and 3. Angola
maintains exchange restrictions under the transitional provisions of Article XIV, and two
restrictions subject to Article VIII, Section 2. These latter two arise from the prohibition of
transfer of dividends and profits under US$100,000 and the discriminatory application of a
stamp duty tax on specific foreign exchange operations. Furthermore, the foreign exchange
auction and the discriminatory application of the stamp duty tax to specific foreign exchange
operation give rise to multiple currency practices (MCPs). The BNA could remove the MCP
related to the foreign exchange auction by either moving to a uniform-price auction system or
by implementing other mechanisms to ensure that the effective rates stay within 2 percentage
points range. 12 Staff supported the authorities’ plan to develop a strategy to liberalize
Angola’s exchange system with a view to controlling risks without undermining the collection
of external sector statistics.
27.
Staff commended the authorities for their efforts to normalize relations with
Paris Club creditors. In this regard, the authorities said they will propose a strategy to
resolve overdue interest to the Paris Club once the government has completed its work on
reconciling debt data.
Medium-term fiscal and external debt sustainability
28.
The medium-term fiscal and balance of payment projections underscore the need
for policy flexibility to promote long-run public and external debt sustainability.13 By the

The finding of multiple currency practices from the Dutch auction do not depend on the actual deviations, but
the potential for spot exchange rates to differ by more than 2 percentage points.

staff’s debt sustainability analysis (DSA), conducted in consultation with the World Bank,
Angola’s risk of debt distress appears moderate; but policy changes are needed to keep public
and external debt sustainable in the long term. In particular, falling oil revenue will need to be
offset by higher tax and nontax revenues and fiscal restraint. Furthermore, the country’s
external current account balance must be managed firmly to ensure that Angola can attract
non-debt-creating capital inflows and develop its non-oil sector. If the medium-term target of
the non-oil primary deficit goes unmet, the fiscal response to lower revenues would be
inadequate (due to declining oil production and exports) or long-term growth in the non-oil
sector would be lower than expected. Public debt in each case over the long run would worsen
rapidly and raise the risk that a disruptive fiscal policy adjustments would be needed to restore
sustainability. Paying off Angola’s current external debt stock would help increase policy
flexibility to deal with future current account deficits.

Angola’s trade regime is liberal and the average tariff low. The country has not,
however, been able to take advantage of preferential trade agreements with the European
Union and the United States because its manufacturing basis is very limited. The World Bank
organized a workshop in July on its 2006 Diagnostic Trade Integration Study to agree with the
authorities on the follow-up actions which donors could support.
IV. OTHER ISSUES
32.
As an alternative to a program relationship with the Fund, the authorities
expressed an interest in engaging in a way that would allow for views on macroeconomic
and structural issues to be exchanged more frequently. The authorities have requested that
a staff team return to Luanda in the fall to advise them on the 2008 budget. They also said they
are interested in stepped-up technical assistance but must first assess their overall needs in
light of assistance offers on the table from other providers.
33.
The authorities have made efforts to strengthen the quality, coverage, and
timeliness of economic statistics but acknowledge that further improvements are needed.
Several surveys, partly financed by the World Bank, have collected data on social indicators
and household expenditures. Measures that address deficiencies in key macroeconomic
statistics would support economic analysis and policy implementation (such as the impact of
poverty spending).
V. STAFF APPRAISAL
34.
Angola has a unique opportunity to achieve its development objectives. After many
years of civil conflict, the country is now politically stable. Upcoming parliamentary and
presidential elections will be important in further consolidating peace and advancing
democracy, thus enhancing prospects for strengthened macroeconomic management. The
authorities have been implementing prudent macroeconomic policies and institutional reforms
to support their development objectives. Rising oil prices, together with abundant oil and
diamond resources and low debt levels, have helped Angola become one of the fastest growing
economies in the world.
35.
The authorities in the short term face a difficult challenge in managing public
expectations. The public is eager to realize a “peace dividend” after years of civil conflict.
Rapid scaling up of public programs, however, could jeopardize recent macroeconomic gains.
It is therefore important to balance the public’s demands with the country’s institutional and
economic capacity to absorb additional resources.
36.
Ensuring low inflation should continue to steer central bank policies. The recent
rate tightening and more flexible exchange rate are encouraging. The BNA should continue to
use a quantity-based monetary framework; the monetary target, however, needs to be
evaluated regularly against changes in the monetary transmission mechanism. Stronger
supervision will be required as the financial system expands.

15
37.
The strategy to liberalize Angola’s exchange rate controls will help the authorities
ensure financial stability and better manage potential capital flows. Angola’s exchange rate
appears broadly consistent with its fundamental determinants. Greater flexibility going
forward would be the best way to accommodate potential pressures on the real exchange rate.
Structural reforms in the non-oil sector should be used to promote the sector’s competitiveness
in the face of an appreciating exchange rate.
38.
Medium-term challenges are for the government to manage its oil wealth to
ensure fiscal soundness and debt sustainability, improve economic competitiveness, and
develop the nonextractive sectors. Given the favorable external environment for oil,
Angola’s main export, near-term prospects are good. However, incomplete structural reforms
and the front-loading of infrastructure and social spending could fan inflation and undercut
non-oil sector real growth once the oil sector matures. Policies must be flexible to
accommodate the effects of maturing oil exports on fiscal revenues and external current
account deficits. In particular, the authorities will face policy tradeoffs in managing external
and domestic borrowing, reserve accumulation, and exchange rate flexibility. While Angola’s
risk of debt distress appears moderate, it is vulnerable to falling oil revenues.
39.
Fiscal policies should be framed in a medium-term context to avoid “boom-bust
cycles.” The budget should be formulated in a time horizon longer than the current two years.
A conservative oil price rule and a target path for the non-oil primary fiscal deficit (percent of
non-oil GDP) would help determine the best path for allocating public resources to current
consumption, capital investment, and the accumulation of net financial assets.
40.
Further strengthening of public financial management systems would ensure that
Angola uses its mineral wealth effectively. The authorities are also encouraged to further
improve fiscal transparency. While significant progress has been made in the development of
an information system, the SIGFE, it still needs to be fully rolled out. Budgeting and planning
capacities remain weak and are characterized by a fragmented budget systems. Furthermore,
the quasi-fiscal operations of Sonangol have not been phased out, which the authorities
consider feasible only in the medium term. The governance and transparency in oil and
diamond sectors need further strengthening. Angola should reduce fuel subsidies and target
them better.
41.
The authorities are urged to reach an agreement with Paris Club creditors so that
Angola can diversify its borrowing strategy. Angola should also reduce its current external
debt stock, which would allow it to deal with future external current account deficits without
undermining long-term debt sustainability.
42.
Institutional and legal reforms to reduce costs and enhance legal protection to
businesses would improve the business climate.
43.
It is expected that the next Article IV consultation will be held on the standard
12-month cycle.

ANGOLA
Joint IMF/World Bank Debt Sustainability Analysis1 2007 under the
Debt Sustainability Framework for Low Income Countries
Prepared by the staffs of the International Monetary Fund and
the International Development Association

Approved by Robert Corker and Mark Plant (IMF)
and Vikram Nehru and Sudhir Shetty (IDA)

August 6, 2007

Based on the joint Low-Income Country Debt Sustainability Framework of the World Bank and
the IMF, Angola is assessed to be at moderate risk of debt distress. Its debt ratios have improved
dramatically over the past several years (thanks to buoyant oil revenues) and are projected to
remain on a declining trend in the medium term under the baseline scenario used in this
analysis. However, debt ratios are projected to edge up beyond the medium term (though
remaining at sustainable levels) as oil revenues decline. With its heavy reliance on oil, however,
Angola remains vulnerable to falling oil revenue.
A. Introduction
1.
This is the second debt sustainability assessment (DSA) for Angola prepared under the
joint Bank-Fund Low-Income Country (LIC) Debt Sustainability Framework (DSF). The 2006
DSA showed that Angola was at a moderate risk of debt distress. Given Angola’s current gross
international reserves and the expected trend growth in these reserves over the medium term,
international reserves are also incorporated into the discussion of debt vulnerability.

Angola’s external debt declined dramatically in 2006 as positive developments in the
oil sector facilitated the clearance of external arrears (Text Table 1). External debt at yearend 2006 fell to US$9.2 billion (about 20 percent of GDP) from US$12.2 billion (40 percent of
GDP) a year earlier. The government had also begun repaying its arrears to Paris Club creditors
in late 2006; by January 2007, it

3.
The strong external position has improved the government’s domestic finances.
Thanks to the rise of oil revenues, the primary surplus was 14.8 percent of GDP in 2006. The
large surplus has allowed the government to limit domestic borrowing and keep domestic debt
low (less than 5 percent of GDP in 2006).
B. The Baseline Macroeconomic Scenario
4.
The baseline scenario assumes (i) continued macroeconomic stabilization, including
fiscal adjustment toward a sustainable fiscal position; (ii) the implementation of structural
reforms aimed at strengthening public financial management and increasing private sector
productivity and investment, particularly in the non-oil sector; and (iii) a prudent debt
management and borrowing strategy. The key macroeconomic assumptions of the baseline
scenario are in Box 1. The medium-to-long-term output and inflation trajectories in this year’s
DSA are similar to those used in the 2006 exercise, with a few exceptions that are outlined
below: (i) output growth is higher in the long run because of higher growth in the non-oil sector
and a slower decline of oil production (both are subject to significant uncertainty; (ii) the real
exchange rate is projected to reflect its fundamental determinants as opposed to assuming a
broadly constant real exchange rate in the 2006 DSA; (iii) higher tail-end output growth
improved export and imports in the long run; (iv) the grant element reflects the current and
2

The low income country debt sustainability framework (LIC DSF) provides indicative levels (thresholds) of debt
burden beyond which a country’s risk of debt distress reaches levels that are considered unacceptable. The LIC DSF
recognizes that better policies and institutions allow countries to manage higher levels of debt, and thus the
threshold levels are policy-dependent. Angola’s policies and institutions, as measured by the World Bank’s Country
Policy and Institutional Assessment (CPIA), place it as a “weak performer.” The relevant indicative thresholds for
this category are indicated in Text Table 1 above.

30
projected costs of funding facing Angola; and (v) the repayment to Paris Club creditors has
lowered the external debt stock in 2006 and the remaining late interest is to be paid in full in
2007. Furthermore, the 2006 DSA did not include public sector debt sustainability analysis.
5.
While the Angolan authorities generally agreed with the merits of pursuing strong
macroeconomic and structural policies, as outlined in the baseline, there are important
risks to the scenario. In particular, the authorities face enormous political pressures to improve
Angola’s infrastructure and the availability of basic social services, which need to be balanced
against the objectives to safeguard macroeconomic stability and maintain fiscal and debt
sustainability.
C. External Debt Sustainability Analysis
Baseline scenario
6.
External debt dynamics over the next decade would be favorable, but would worsen
beyond 2017 as oil revenues decline (Table 1 and Figure 2). However, the debt-burden
indicators would remain below their policy-dependent thresholds throughout the period.
7.
The risk of debt distress appears to be moderate. Under most of the standardized
stress tests (Table 2), the debt burden indicators remain well below their threshold values
throughout the next 20 years.
8.
Angola’s debt levels are vulnerable to export shocks. A drop in exports (measured as
the standard deviation of historical average) in 2008–09 would push the NPV debt-to-GDP over
the 30 percent indicative threshold level in 2008–13, while the NPV of debt-to-exports and the
debt service-to-exports ratios would be above their respective indicative thresholds over most of
the projection period (Figure 2). This shows that Angola could become vulnerable to debt
distress due to its heavy reliance on oil exports.
9.
Although vulnerability to variations in the value of oil exports is of concern, the
standardized stress tests may overstate Angola’s external vulnerability. The shock impacts
export growth in 2008–09, where baseline projections of strong export growth (as new oil fields
begin production) are subject to relatively low uncertainty compared with (lower) projections
beyond this period. Furthermore, in the DSA the financing in response to an adverse export
shock is assumed to come from increased external borrowing. However, Angola could use its
large accumulated international reserves to cushion against temporary shocks to reduce the risk
of debt distress.

31
Box 1. Macroeconomic Assumptions in the Baseline Scenario
Real GDP is projected to grow about 12 percent a year in 2007–12 and fall to 4½ percent a year in
2013–27. While real output growth in the oil sector is expected to level off as the sector matures,
growth in the non-oil sector (including diamond, manufacturing, agriculture, construction, and
services) would remain robust, in part reflecting large infrastructure and other investments and the
implementation of reforms to support private sector activities and higher productivity. This would
boost real incomes and employment, which would promote higher private consumption and
investment.
Inflation is projected to fall to the middle single digits by 2012 and remain there. Monetary policy
is geared toward achieving this objective. The exchange rate path reflects movements in the
Fundamental Equilibrium Exchange Rate in Angola, a measure that depends on relative per capita
growth and trade openness.
The fiscal position is projected to weaken in the medium to long run as oil revenues decline as a
percent of GDP; it would eventually shift into a deficit. The revenue-to-GDP ratio would fall from
47 percent of GDP in 2006 to 30 percent in 2012 and to 23 percent by 2027. The overall surplus is
projected to fall from 6.7 percent of GDP in 2006 to 3.7 percent in 2012 and to a deficit of 3 percent
of GDP in 2027. This decline is going to increase domestic financing of the budget and interest
expenditure; but given the initially low levels of domestic and foreign debt debt-service, the debt
service burden is expected to stay moderate through 2027. Furthermore, the non-oil primary deficit
is projected to be halved by 2012 from 50 percent of non-oil GDP in 2006. It should then shrink
another 50 percent to about 14 percent in 2027.
The external current account balance is projected to shift to a deficit in 2011as a result of the
maturing oil industry and falling oil exports. Given the dominance of oil sector exports, even the
assumed robust growth of non-oil exports is not enough to make up for the loss of export revenue
from oil. The external current account deficit is projected to stabilize at 6¾ percent of GDP in the
outer years. The financing of current account deficits is assumed to come mainly from non-debtcreating inflows, which include direct investment inflows into the non-oil and non-extractive
sectors; those inflows will stabilize at about 5 percent of GDP in 2017–27. In addition, external
current account deficits are in part financed through the sales of international reserves, which are
projected to fall to about 3 months of import cover by 2017, and debt inflows, which are projected
to peak at 3½ percent of GDP in 2021 and stabilize thereafter.

Alternative scenarios
10.
Two customized scenarios were developed to better assess Angola’s vulnerability
to debt distress. These are:
•

Alternative scenario A: incomplete structural reforms. This scenario highlights the
importance of persevering with structural reforms to spur the development of the nonoil sector.

•

Alternative scenario B: permanently lower revenue from oil exports.

11.
These scenarios are designed to illustrate specific points rather than serve as
projections under a different environment than the one assumed in the baseline. The
scenarios assume that shocks to the Angolan economy are permanent and that there are no
policy responses by the authorities, other than what is required to maintain a minimum
cushion of foreign exchange reserves.
Alternative scenario A: Incomplete structural reforms
12.
This scenario captures features of the staff’s alternative macroeconomic scenario
(extended through 2027) and assumes incomplete structural reforms and additional upfront fiscal expansion. Incomplete structural reforms hinder the development of the non-oil
sector, lower its export potential, and dampen investment and productivity. The main
assumptions are
•

A two percent of GDP permanent decline in the baseline value of foreign direct
investment in the non-oil sector in 2008–27 and no adjustment in government
spending plans in 2008–12 until the shock is recognized as permanent;

•

A decline in export proceeds (goods and services) from the non-oil sector; and

•

Lower imports than in the baseline as a result of lower growth and investment.

13.
The net effect is an unsustainable external current account deficit, which would
reach 13 percent of GDP by 2027. Financing needs are initially met through a combination
of additional borrowing and some loss of reserves (import cover of reserves falls from around
4¼ months in 2006 to a minimum cushion of 2 months in 2015–27), followed by much larger
borrowing than in the baseline. Under the scenario, all debt indicators would breach their
thresholds beginning around 2019 (Figure 3).

33
Alternative scenario B: Lower revenue from oil exports
14.
This scenario further explores Angola’s external vulnerability to an export shock
by assuming a permanent decline in the growth rate of oil exports. The main assumptions
are
•

A 10 percent permanent decline in the baseline U.S. dollar value of oil exports in
2008–27, and no adjustment in government spending plans in 2008–10 until the
shock is recognized as permanent.3 The decline in the value of oil exports could
represent both oil price drops and lower oil production (thus exports) following fewer
discoveries of new oil reserves than those assumed in the baseline scenario.

•

The fall in oil export proceeds is assumed to result in lower oil profit remittances
and lower foreign direct investment into the oil sector, which lowers the baseline
value of oil sector imports.

15.
The impact on the balance of payments under this scenario is smaller than that
under the alternative scenario of incomplete structural reforms. The net effect of this
scenario is a widening of the current account deficit (by an average 1¾ percent of GDP over
the scenario period). The deficit peaks in 2021 and narrows to 8½ percent of GDP by 2027,
4½ percentage points below the current account in the alternative scenario of incomplete
structural reforms. Against the backdrop of wider capital and financial account deficits, the
result is higher external borrowing than in the baseline. The financing needs are initially met
through lower reserve holdings (import coverage of reserves falls from around 4¼ months in
2006 to a minimum cushion of two months in 2012–27) and then through additional debt
creation. The various debt measures would exceed their indicative thresholds around 2015
(Figure 3) and would then remain considerably above the thresholds, though at lower levels
than under the alternative scenario of incomplete structural reforms. The outcome of this
scenario confirms the vulnerability of Angola’s economy to shocks to its main export and
underscores the importance of developing the non-oil sector to diversify the economy.

3

The assumed 10 percent decline is smaller than the standard deviation based on historical data. However, the
latter is significantly influenced by the recent run up in oil prices, which may not provide a realistic baseline for
assessing future vulnerability to oil exports.

D. Public Debt Sustainability Analysis
Baseline scenario
16.
The baseline scenario projects that central government debt (external and
domestic) will rise from about 18 percent of GDP in 2007 to about 20 percent in 2027, of
which about 70 percent is from external sources (Table 3). The net present value (NPV) of
the debt-to-GDP ratio is expected to decrease first, from about 25 percent in 2007 to below
10 percent by 2017, after which it is expected to rise gradually to about 22 percent. The
baseline scenario projects a weakening fiscal position, with a deficit expected beginning in
2020 (the deficit would widen to about 4 percent of GDP by 2027). The deficits will be
financed by issuing domestic debt securities, in line with the authorities’ stated medium-term
goal, and borrowing from abroad. Although the debt stock and debt services are projected to
rise in the medium to long term (as a percent of GDP), they would be within reasonable
bounds. The standard shock and bound tests (Table 4) suggest the economy is highly
vulnerable to negative shocks to real growth, fiscal balance, and the exchange rate.
Alternative scenarios
17.
Two alternative scenarios were developed to illustrate the impact of (i) lower real
output growth (particularly in the non-oil sector) because of the effect of the incomplete
adjustment of the non-oil primary fiscal deficit on public sector; and (ii) lower fiscal
revenues or an incomplete fiscal adjustment. The lower growth and revenue scenarios are
similar to the alternative scenarios discussed in the external debt sustainability analysis.
Alternative scenario A: Incomplete fiscal adjustment
18.
An incomplete fiscal adjustment would cause the debt stock and debt services to
rise rapidly, either because revenues are lower than anticipated or the non-oil primary
deficit narrows more slowly because of scaled-up infrastructure and social sector spending.
Lower-than-expected revenues would mainly reflect a more rapid decline in oil exports than
in the baseline scenario. Both alternatives are assumed to be permanent and, without other
policy changes, would weaken the fiscal position and lead to higher public borrowing. The
NPV of the debt-to-GDP ratio would rise to about 112 percent in 2027 from 22 percent in the
baseline as a result of a larger (10-percentage points) non-oil primary deficit (as a percent of
non-oil GDP) a year in 2008–27. The NPV of the debt-to-revenue ratio would quadruple by
2027, and the debt service–-to-revenue ratio would rise to about 100 percent by 2027. The
effects of a 10 percent permanent reduction in oil exports (U.S. dollars) would be similar but
less pronounced than the effect of a 10 percent widening in the non-oil primary deficit,
mainly because it has a smaller impact on the primary deficit.

40
Alternative scenario B: Lower real output growth
19.
A negative output shock underscores the importance of promoting non-oil sector
productivity and investment (Figure 4). Lower real growth (the simulation assumes
2 percent lower real GDP growth in each year in 2008–27) reduces the fiscal space and,
without a corresponding reduction in fiscal spending, would increase the NPV of debt-toGDP ratio to 335 percent in 2027 from 22 percent in the baseline. The NPV of the debt-torevenue and debt service–to-revenue ratios will also rise rapidly in the medium to long run.
This scenario highlights the importance of being ready to reduce public outlays more rapidly
than envisioned in the baseline in the event that (1) oil production declines faster than
expected; and (2) non-oil sector growth falls short of the levels assumed in the baseline. It
could be difficult to increase tax collections from the non-oil sector if that sector grows more
slowly because of declines in real incomes and productivity.
E. Conclusions
20.
An analysis of Angola’s public and external debt suggests it has a moderate risk
of debt distress. Total public debt in the baseline scenario would rise from 18 percent of
GDP in 2007 to about 22 percent in 2027 but is expected to remain moderate in part because
of low debt levels at the start. On the other hand, external public debt is projected to stabilize
well below standard thresholds in the long term, after initially declining because of favorable
external outcomes, but Angola’s external debt position is highly vulnerable to variations in
the value of its oil exports.
21.
The debt sustainability analysis underscores the need to reduce vulnerability to
the oil sector and build the non-oil sector. Without changes to macroeconomic policy, a
more rapid fall in oil production and exports or lower non-oil sector growth than in the
baseline would lead to unsustainable debt and debt-service ratios in the long run. Therefore,
paying off existing public debt, which at present largely comes from external sources, would
give the government more policy options when fiscal and external current account pressures
arise in the future.

IX.
Exchange Arrangements: Reflecting the stability of the kwanza exchange rate due
to interventions of the Banco Nacional de Angola (BNA) in the foreign exchange market to
sterilize foreign currency inflows associated with oil tax receipts, effective April 1, 2006,
Angola’s de facto exchange rate was reclassified as a conventional fixed peg; it had been
managed floating with no predetermined path for the exchange rate. Nonetheless, as
declared, the BNA would not defend the parity should the currency be subject to downward
pressures from market forces. The BNA publishes a daily reference rate, which is computed
as the transaction-weighted average of the previous day’s rates negotiated with commercial
banks. Banks and exchange bureaus may deal among themselves and with their customers at
freely negotiated rates.
Angola avails itself of the transitional provisions of Article XIV, Section 2, and also
maintains exchange restrictions and multiple currency practices subject to approval under
Article VIII, Sections 2 and 3. The identified exchange restrictions include a limit on the
remittance of dividends and profits from foreign investments of up to US$100,000,
requirements for prior approval on business related current invisible transactions. Multiple
currency practices arise from the differential in spot exchange rates amongst the BNA’s
currency auction, interbank market and retail foreign exchange market. A foreign exchange

45
stamp tax applicable to electronic remittances constitutes both an exchange restriction and
multiple currency practice.

ANNEX II—IMF-WORLD BANK RELATIONS
The World Bank’s role in Angola’s post conflict recovery
1.
In February 2005 the World Bank Board of Executive Directors approved an Interim
Strategy Note (ISN) to support the government’s program for 2005–06. A second ISN June
2007 to June 2009 was discussed by the Board in May 2007. The ISN has three pillars:
(i) strengthening public sector management and government institutional capacity;
(ii) supporting the rebuilding of critical infrastructure and the improvement of service delivery
for poverty reduction; and (iii) promoting the growth of nonmineral sectors. The IFC and the
Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency (MIGA) are also providing services to promote
Angola’s development.
Bank Group strategy and lending operations
2.

Financial support under the ISN is provided for the following projects:
a.
Emergency Multisector Recovery Project. Following a ring-fenced approach to
ensure proper use of Bank funds, the project will help key ministries and agencies build
capacity to transparently and soundly manage investment projects. Efforts will include
both formal training programs and staff coaching as the daily activities of the project’s
management and implementation unit unfold. The focus will be on procurement and
financial management; the aim will be to establish modern financial management
systems for use throughout participating ministries and agencies. The project will also
assist two ministries (energy and water) as they prepare to conduct public expenditure
tracking surveys. Finally, in close coordination with the Social Action Fund Project and
the U.N. Capital Development Fund, the project will help establish fiscal transfer
mechanisms (from central to local governments), based on the results of a pilot.
b.
Social Action Fund Project. The project is expected to strengthen the planning
and expenditure management of subnational governments. The transparent, inclusive
approach of the project will be carried over to the operations of local government to give
the poor improved access to basic services.
c.
Smallholder Agriculture Development Project. The project will help the
Ministry of Agriculture, both the central and local levels, and other stakeholders build
capacity to deliver the various services farmers need to produce and market agricultural
goods. Following a ring-fenced approach to ensure proper use of Bank funds, the project
will help the ministry to strengthen its fiduciary management.
d.
Water Sector Institutional Development Project. The proposed Water
Institutional Development Project will focus on creating regulatory and institutional
frameworks for delivering water and sanitation services. It will finance technical

48

assistance to help the water utilities in three provincial capitals to provide services on a
commercial basis, fully covering costs for operations and maintenance. This is intended
to strengthen the transparency and sustainability of operations.
3.
New nonlending services are focusing on (i) advice on implementing Angola’s
economic program; (ii) analyses to strengthen the knowledge base of the authorities and
implementation of their poverty reduction strategy (ECP); and (iii) the additional diagnostics
needed for preparing an effective longer-term program of Bank Group support under a Country
Assessment Strategy (CAS). The main components are the following:
•

Public Expenditure Review (PER): The PER will complement the 2004 PEMFAR
(Public Expenditure Management and Financial Review). It will assess Angola’s
expenditure priorities across and within functions, given resource constraints and
distributional objectives; examine the link between expenditure inputs and outcomes;
and assess the public sector’s institutional arrangements (including political incentives).
It will focus on agriculture, education, and health. It will also give suggestions for
reforming incentives and institutions to improve public spending.

•

Public expenditure management and financial accountability (PEFA) review, as a basis
for a Public Financial Management Project (FY2009).

•

Support the Financial Sector Reform and Strengthening Initiative (FIRST), a multidonor
program to promote development of nonbank financial institutions and to improve the
quality and availability of information necessary for financial transactions.

•

Investment Climate Assessment (ICA): The objective of the ICA will be to evaluate the
investment climate in Angola in all its operational dimensions and identify policies to
strengthen the private sector. Results would feed into future Bank Group operations and
technical assistance. The ICA could also be used to give potential investors information
on the business environment.

•

Capacity Development Assessment: The Bank, in collaboration with other donors, will
promote a policy dialogue with the government and civil society on how best to build
capacity. It will engage members of government and civil society that are concerned and
knowledgeable about the country’s deficits.

•

Maximizing In-Country and World Bank Group Support: Efforts will be made to
strengthen the Country Office’s fiduciary capacity (procurement and financial
management) and in-house technical capability (for example, dedicated rural specialists).

Strengthen the government’s capacity in project management, procurement and financial
management, and expenditure tracking (EMRP I and II).

49

The International Finance Corporation
4.
IFC is currently negotiating for possible investments in infrastructure, general
manufacturing, and private education. In the oil sector, it will seek to identify projects that
maximize local benefits and that can be used as entry points into the sector. IFC also aims to
promote private participation in infrastructure, capital market development, and advisory
services to the government on privatization and structuring concessions. In addition, it will step
up its technical assistance to entrepreneurs of small and medium-sized businesses; it plans a
greater role for the restructured African Project Development Facility.
The Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency
5.
MIGA’s guarantees for investments could become increasingly important in Angola,
given international perceptions of the political risks there. When the authorities resolve two
small but long-standing investment disputes it is investigating, MIGA and the authorities should
be in a position to tackle new opportunities.
Performance assessment
6.
It is proposed to assess Angola’s performance against a set of general postconflict
indicators and a smaller number of specific indicators based on actions initiated under the TSS.
These would support movement to a results-based CAS. A likely results matrix for the CAS
could be based on priorities set by the ECP and emphasize joint outcomes from continuing
support to the authorities for medium- and long-term development planning, transparent
management of mineral and nonmineral resources for growth, enhancing capacity, rural
development, and improving access to basic services and infrastructure.
IMF-World Bank Collaboration
7.
The IMF and World Bank staffs worked together to design and monitor the April–
December 2000 and January–June 2001 Staff-Monitored Programs. They continue to cooperate
closely on aspects of Angola’s economic reform process: structural and transparency-related
reforms, public expenditure management and policy issues, the interim Poverty Reduction
Strategy Paper, and macroeconomic stabilization. Bank staff participate in IMF Article IV
missions and other discussions with the authorities on the country’s macroeconomic situation;
Fund staff worked on the Bank’s PEMFAR and CEM, and contributed advice on oil
transparency.

50
ANNEX III—STATISTICAL ISSUES
1.
While economic statistics are adequate for surveillance, there are major concerns about
their quality and timeliness. Efforts are underway to strengthen the statistical base, including
through technical assistance from the Fund and the World Bank.
2.
The authorities are committed to using the GDDS to improve the statistical system.
Angola has participated in the GDDS project for Lusophone African countries, and received
technical assistance. Metadata for the macroeconomic sectors were first posted on the IMF’s
Dissemination Standards Bulletin Board (DSBB) in October 2003 but have not been updated
since.
3.
The only regular statistical publication is the quarterly National Bank of Angola (BNA)
statistical bulletin, which is often published with a considerable delay. It is complemented by
the BNA website (www.bna.ao). Data postings on the government website (www.minfin.gv.ao),
including revenues from the oil sector, have not been as timely as recommended in the GDDS.
Government accounts are released when the annual budget is approved.
4.
National accounts and prices. Among deficiencies in national accounts data are breaks
in time series and inter-sectoral inconsistencies. Official GDP estimates are produced annually
and generally only by sector, with no desegregation by industry. Annual GDP at constant prices
is estimated at previous-year prices using tentative deflators. There are no estimates of GDP by
expenditure. Apart from oil production, sectoral data are calculated using indicators with
weights based on incomplete surveys conducted in 2001 or earlier. A lack of statistical offices in
the provinces significantly limits data coverage. The consumer price index (CPI) is based on a
basket of goods and services for which prices are collected in Luanda. The geographical
coverage of price collection was extended to five more provinces and an unofficial quarterly
index has been compiled commencing in 2005. An STA CPI Mission in September 2006 did not
regard the resulting data as sufficiently reliable for publication. The CPI weights were revised
in January 2002 based on a household survey conducted in 2001. CPI data are produced
monthly, normally with a lag of two weeks. There are no wholesale or producer price indices.
5.
Money and banking statistics. Data for the depository corporation survey and the
balance sheet of the central bank based on old report forms are now timely, although there have
been deficiencies in the reporting of foreign exchange reserves and concerns about the quality
and timeliness of reports from some commercial banks. The authorities introduced a new plan of
accounts for financial institutions in early 2001, when they began to compile data on foreign
assets and liabilities more in line with the Monetary and Financial Statistics Manual (MFSM).
An STA mission in March 2006 assisted the BNA to start compiling monthly monetary statistics
using the new standardized report forms (SRFs). The mission made several recommendations
for improving monetary statistics and finalizing the SRFs, including the classification of bank
holdings of treasury bills and bonds and central bank bills, and the valuation of foreign
currency-denominated accounts. Further priorities were to improve accounting procedures in
state-owned banks and strengthen BNA’s internal controls, particularly for external transactions.
In general, the implementation of the mission’s recommendations was poor, although there was

51
progress in preparing a new plan of accounts for the other depository corporations, expected to
be implemented in 2009.
6.
A follow-up mission in May 2007 assisted the BNA in finalizing the SRFs for the central
bank, but further work is needed by the BNA to finalize the SRF for the other depository
corporations. The mission also focused on the intersectoral consistency of the monetary and the
government finance and balance of payments statistics, and provided on-the-job training. The
SRFs, once finalized by the BNA, will provide enhanced monetary statistics disaggregated by
currency, financial instrument, and economic sector. The SRFs will be used to derive an
integrated monetary database to meet the needs of AFR, STA, and the BNA.
7.
Fiscal accounts. Although the Ministry of Finance (MoF) has had a new chart of
accounts for some time, the chart is not yet fully operational. Since 2004, the government has
included in its budget execution data Sonangol’s quasi-fiscal expenditures and assessments of
its liabilities for payments of oil revenue to the government. However, the data are often late
and not subject to effective scrutiny. Data for capital expenditures are largely estimated, the
classification system offers little opportunity for analytic insight, and coverage is incomplete.
Data from the SIGFE management information system are still limited in coverage and
reliability. Monthly government accounts rely to an unusually large extent on estimates based
on the budget rather than on actual execution figures. The MoF does not report government
finance data for publication in the GFS Yearbook or in International Financial Statistics.
8.
Angola’s participation in the GDDS project aims to improve the quality and timeliness
of fiscal data. A technical assistance mission in May 2006 found that recommendations from a
government finance statistics mission in May–June 2003 had only been partially implemented.
The fiscal programming unit (established in the MoF with USAID support) will seek to
systematize collection, analysis, and consistency checks for monthly and annual government
accounts. However, it has substantial training needs.

the IMF’s Balance of Payments Manual (BPM5) and are now producing balance of payments
data every quarter. However, there are still weaknesses in data sources.

An STA mission in June 2005 identified continuing problems in collecting data on the
operations of the oil companies, the overseas accounts of large enterprises, and foreign direct
investment. Furthermore, data on imports are minimal and detail on services and income
components are missing. Essential details in the financial account are not reported due to
problems with proper recording of public external debt transactions, particularly debt
restructuring and forgiveness. Data for net international reserves are incomplete, particularly
concerning information on official foreign exchange balances in overseas escrow accounts.
While the authorities have continued to improve the management of external debt data and
compilation has improved, data quality remains a cause for concern. The MoF transmits
information to the central bank on disbursements from bilateral credit lines and debt servicing
on an irregular basis.

Statement by the IMF Staff Representative
August 27, 2007

The following information has become available since the issuance of the staff report for
the 2007 Article IV consultation with Angola. The new information does not alter the thrust of
the staff appraisal.
1.
The expansion of oil production in 2007 has not materialized at the rate initially
anticipated by the authorities. Reflecting this, the government revised downward its 2007 oil
production from 736.7 million barrels to 626.6 million barrels in its mid-year review of the 2007
budget. The revision is in line with staff projections in the staff report. The authorities explained
that the revision in oil production reflects technical difficulties in getting equipment to the
production platforms. The projected output for the non-oil sector remained unchanged. The
authorities therefore project real GDP to expand by 19.8 percent in 2007, compared to
31.2 percent in the original budget.
2.
The 2007 revised budget further underscores the importance of framing fiscal
policies in a medium-term context. Following the downward revision of the projected oil
output in 2007, the government also lowered its revenue target for 2007 from 37.4 percent of
GDP to 35.5 percent of GDP. However, outlays were increased from 40.7 percent of GDP to
44.2 percent of GDP in the revised budget, including a 4 percentage point increase in the capital
budget relative to the original budget. If the authorities fully implement the revised budget,
which in staff’s view is unlikely because of continuing implementation bottlenecks, the non-oil
primary deficit would widen to 75.4 percent of non-oil GDP (10 percentage points higher than in
the original budget). The price of oil per barrel was also raised from US$45 to US$52 in the
revised budget.
3.
Inflation in July remained at around 12 percent (year-on-year), unchanged from the
end of 2006. The government kept the year-end inflation target at 10 percent, as in the original
budget. The exchange rate has remained stable following revaluation in May 2007 from Kz 80 to
Kz 75 against the U.S. dollar.
4.
The National Bank of Angola (BNA) contained base money growth to about
10 percent during the twelve-month period to July 2007 through interventions in the foreign
exchange and domestic money markets (the sales of BNA bills grew by about 70 percent of the
beginning-of-the-year monetary base). Broad money expanded at an annual rate of about
50 percent in June.

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2007 Article IV Consultation
with Angola
On August 27, 2007, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF)
concluded the Article IV consultation with Angola.1
Background
Angola’s recent macroeconomic performance has been good. Output growth has been
robust since 2001 both in the oil and non-oil sectors (diamonds, manufacturing,
construction, processing, and services). Inflation has fallen considerably from high levels.
However, poverty remains deeply entrenched with infant and maternal mortality, literacy,
sanitation, and access to clean water for most of the population comparing poorly with other
African countries of similar per capita income.
Real GDP growth in 2006 reached 18.6 percent, supported by double-digit growth in both
the oil and non-oil sectors. Oil production increased by 13 percent mainly from new
deepwater oilfields while diamonds production rose on the back of increased production
from kimberlite mines. The manufacturing sector benefited largely from the better economic
environment and construction from ongoing rehabilitation of infrastructure. Good weather,

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies.
On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion
by the Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as
Chairman of the Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is
transmitted to the country's authorities.

2
timely availability of inputs, and an increase in the cultivated area, helped agricultural
production although this was partly offset by drought conditions in some central and
southern provinces.
Inflation fell from 19 to 12 percent during 2006. The nominal exchange rate held steady
throughout 2006 while the real exchange rate appreciated by about 6 percent. Interest rates
adjusted for inflation have been negative. The growth of monetary aggregates remained
high in 2006 except for base money, which was flat following the National Bank of Angola’s
(BNA’s) interventions in the market to mop up liquidity.
The fiscal balance has moved to a surplus, but on average Angola has saved a smaller
portion of its oil windfall than other African oil-producers. The fiscal surplus in 2006 reached
15 percent of GDP, against a deficit of 6 percent of GDP in the budget. This was a direct
result of the government’s weak capacity to execute fully the capital budget. Excluding oil
revenues, Angola saw a large decline in the non-oil primary deficit.
The external current account surplus widened to 23 percent of GDP in 2006, and official
reserves doubled and reached US$8.5 billion in the year, equivalent to about four months of
imports of goods and services. This is partly because Angola’s two main exports, crude oil
and diamonds, have experienced large volume increases. Export revenues have also been
boosted by the rise in crude oil export prices. During late 2006 and early 2007 Angola paid
the bulk (US$2.3 billion) of its principal and interest arrears to Paris Club creditors. Angola
also plans to pay the remaining arrears (US$49 million) and has begun making payments on
maturities falling due. The outstanding issue concerns the late interest for which Angola is
seeking favorable treatment from the Paris Club. The external debt-to-GDP ratio declined
from 40 percent in 2005 to about 20 percent in 2006.
Progress under structural reforms has been modest. Angola’s most successful initiative on
public financial management (PFM) and fiscal transparency continues to be the information
system, SIGFE. This system covers all provinces and will be extended in 2007 to include
some autonomous bodies and new modules. The SIGFE has helped strengthen budget
execution and reporting and the sharing of information on PFM issues. In the private sector,
however, a comparison with other regional economies highlights areas for improvements in
the business climate.
Executive Board Assessment
Directors commended the Angolan authorities for the recent good macroeconomic
performance, characterized by double-digit growth rates, a fall in inflation, large fiscal and
external surpluses, and a reduction in the debt-to-GDP ratio. They noted that both prudent
policies and rising oil production and prices have led to these achievements.
Looking ahead, Directors underscored that major challenges remain. A key challenge will be
to reduce inflation further, boost external competitiveness, and achieve medium-term fiscal
and external debt sustainability while accommodating Angola’s large infrastructure and
social needs. Also, a strong effort will be required to develop the non-oil sectors of the
economy. This is crucial for reducing the dependence on oil production and achieving the

3
Millennium Development Goals. Directors encouraged the authorities to take advantage of
the present favorable economic environment to advance quickly with structural reforms.
Directors urged the authorities to exercise caution in implementing the planned scale-up of
government capital spending. They were sympathetic to the pressures for scaled-up
spending as a “peace dividend” and to help re-build the country following the end of the civil
war. Nevertheless, they stressed that the scaling up should be consistent with the country’s
implementation and absorptive capacity, and should not undermine the competitiveness of
the non-oil sectors through upward price pressures. Furthermore, care should be taken to
ensure that only economically sound investment projects are undertaken. Most Directors
urged adoption of a medium-term fiscal framework to guide government spending, with
fiscal policy anchored on further reducing the non-oil primary fiscal deficit as a share of nonoil GDP and on a conservative oil price rule. However, a few Directors felt it would be
important to wait until the economy has achieved a more stable trajectory before adopting a
medium-term fiscal framework. The establishment of an oil fund based on well-defined,
flexible, and transparent rules, and fully integrated into the budget process, would enhance
management of the oil wealth. Directors also supported a gradual phase-out of fuel
subsidies, in conjunction with targeted measures to offset the impact on low-income
households, and tax reform to strengthen the non-oil revenue base.
Directors commended the progress in strengthening public financial management and
enhancing governance and transparency in the extractive industries. They urged further
action to address remaining weaknesses in the capacity to execute and monitor public
expenditures. They also encouraged the authorities to rapidly implement the
recommendations of the Fiscal Report on the Observance of Standards and Codes, to
phase out the state oil company’s quasi-fiscal operations, and to join the Extractive
Industries Transparency Initiative.
Directors commended the central bank’s prudent conduct of monetary policy. Given the
extensive dollarization, shallow financial markets, and instability of money velocity, Directors
emphasized that monetary policy should continue to be pragmatic and flexible. They
supported the use of a target range for the monetary aggregate in conjunction with a broad
set of inflation indicators, and recommended that the choice of intermediate policy target be
evaluated continuously. Directors considered the FSAP planned for 2008 to be an important
step toward deepening and strengthening the financial sector, and thereby increasing the
effectiveness of monetary policy.
Directors welcomed the authorities’ revaluation of the nominal exchange rate earlier this
year. A number of Directors encouraged a gradual shift to a more flexible exchange rate to
support a reduction in inflation and to accommodate appreciation pressures on the currency.
Several other Directors, however, felt that the authorities’ strategy of managing the
exchange rate without a pre-determined path is appropriate in view of the extensive
dollarization and under-developed financial sector, and the possible adverse impact of a
currency appreciation on the development of the non-oil sectors.

4
Directors encouraged the authorities to eliminate the remaining exchange restrictions, so
that Angola could accept the obligations under Article VIII, Sections 2, 3, and 4 of the IMF’s
Articles of Agreement.
Directors commended the authorities’ progress in clearing Angola’s arrears to Paris Club
creditors, and encouraged the authorities to continue their efforts to resolve the issue of
overdue arrears.
Directors called for faster structural reform to develop the non-oil sectors of the economy.
Institutional and legal reforms to improve the business environment would increase
productivity, reduce the cost of doing business, and enhance legal protection of businesses.
This would stimulate private investment and enhance external competitiveness.

Statement by Peter Gakunu, Executive Director for Angola
and Jose Sulemane, Advisor to Executive Director
August 27, 2007
The Angolan authorities wish to acknowledge the Fund's constructive engagement and
dialogue, and thank staff for the well written reports which clearly identify the development
challenges as well as the policy options facing the country in the medium to long term.
Recent Macroeconomic Developments
Angola continues to record remarkable growth performance resulting from implementation of
strong macroeconomic and structural policies. Real GDP growth in 2006 was 18.6 percent,
following an impressive growth rate of 20.6 percent in 2005. Both oil and non-oil sectors grew
at double-digits (13.1 and 27.5 percent, respectively). Good weather, high oil prices and
countrywide reconstruction activities contributed to this outturn. Angola has made significant
progress in reducing inflation from 18.5 percent in 2005 to 12.2 percent at the end of
December 2006. Increased exports of the main commodities (crude oil and diamonds) further
strengthened the external account. The current account surplus jumped from 16.8 percent of
GDP in 2005 to 23.3 percent in 2006, and net international reserves more than doubled during
the year, reaching US$ 8.6 billion, almost 7 months of imports of non-oil goods and services.
On the fiscal side, high oil prices and rising oil production and exports provided significant
boost to government revenues in 2006. As a result, the overall fiscal surplus amounted to
14.8 percent of GDP, doubling the fiscal surplus from previous year, though the capital
spending shortfall also contributed to this outcome.
On monetary sector, the BNA continued to intervene in the market to mop up excess liquidity
from the economy. As a result, base money growth remained within targeted levels, while the
exchange rate remained stable throughout the year. However, other monetary aggregates grew
rapidly, following increased demand for credit reflecting strong growth in construction and
transportation sectors. The banking system remained strong and well capitalized.
Policies for 2007–08
The authorities have been implementing two-year economic programs; the 2007–08 program
envisages the consolidation of macroeconomic reforms and price stability, which aim at
supporting private sector activities, coupled with reforms in the public, financial and legal
sectors. In the meantime, the medium term prospects for the economy remain positive, and
recent developments suggest that real growth will remain strong, given the favorable external
conditions. Real GDP growth for 2007 is projected to be about 23 percent, reflecting the
coming into production of new oil fields, and also robust growth in agriculture, construction,
and the power sector. For the period 2008–12, growth is expected to average 7.5 percent per
annum.

2

The authorities are aware of the medium term challenges facing the economy and will continue
to take appropriate measures, including improving the management of oil wealth to ensure
long-term fiscal and debt sustainability; improving the competitiveness of the economy; and
development of the non-oil/non-extractive sectors of the economy. While recognizing that oil is
the major commodity contributing to GDP and exports, the authorities are conscious of the
volatility of this market and are working towards the design and implementation of a mix of
policies with a medium term focus to avoid boom-bust cycles and also pursue structural
reforms to support the development of the non-oil sectors.
The authorities are investing the oil revenues in programs that maximize social and economic
returns and ensure broad based development. They are committed to building institutional
capacity and implementing reforms that will facilitate efficient and effective public
administration, while developing a legal framework conducive to rapid and sustainable
economic and social development.
Fiscal Policy
The authorities remain strongly committed to improving public financial management (PFM)
and moving towards a multi-year fiscal framework with prioritized medium term spending, as a
comprehensive approach to tackle the relationship between oil revenues and infrastructure
spending for future development of the Angolan economy. The authorities believe that a
stronger PFM is important for strengthening budgeting and improving its monitoring.
As acknowledged by staff, the government's recent practice of adopting conservative oil-price
rule is important in guiding expenditures and creating some buffer. However, staff have
suggested the use of the concept of non-oil primary balance as an anchor to assessing the fiscal
stance. The authorities feel that a more appropriate indicator should be non-oil primary current
balance, to take into account the particular situation of Angola which calls for higher levels of
investment in infrastructure given the needs for the reconstruction effort.
Angola is successively emerging from almost 30 years of civil war, with practically no
infrastructure and human capital. There is a need therefore to invest heavily in these areas, in
order to unleash the non-oil economic activity. Therefore, the country needs to expand capital
expenditures financed by oil revenues, provided that they are within the limits of its absorptive
capacity. On the other hand, most of the expenditure would be on imports, which counters the
argument of increased domestic liquidity that might bring about inflationary pressures. Hence,
the focus should be on assisting the country to undertake post conflict reconstruction in an
efficient and effective manner.
Monetary Policy
The authorities are in agreement with staff on the BNA's decision to use a monetary target to
anchor its inflation objective. However, due to the extensive dollarization, the choice of the

3

intermediate policy target would need to be evaluated on a continuous basis to ensure its
relevance.
The authorities agree that, an appropriate exchange rate policy could promote higher
productivity and facilitate trade expansion and more diversification of the economy, taking
advantage of the already liberalized trade regime. At the same time, the exchange rate policy
choice must take into consideration the presence of dollarization, lack of monetary instruments
and the shallow markets. Furthermore, in the case of Angola, while the exchange rate regime is
an important factor, there is a need to give greater attention to the product and labor markets,
reforms aimed at productivity growth, infrastructure development, improvement in business
and investment environment, and also financial markets development. While the banking sector
in Angola continues to expand and become more competitive, the authorities will continue to
address the major weaknesses in the sector, and strengthen the BNA's analytical capacity and
on- and off-site monitoring of banks, consistent with the process of modernization of the sector.
They welcome the TA support from the Fund to develop a financial sector strategy which
would be based on the findings of an FSAP mission to be undertaken next year.
Structural Reforms
The Angolan authorities have been implementing reforms to address the consequences of the
prolonged civil war. A critical area has been strengthening PFM to ensure effective
management of the growing mineral wealth. Measures are also being undertaken to improve
budget preparation, the coordination between the capital and current expenditures, and dialogue
between the Ministry of Finance/Ministry of Planning and line ministries on budgeting and
planning issues. Similarly, the accountability system is being strengthened.
The authorities are aware of the need for major reforms to improve the business climate.
Greater emphasis will be placed on developing the private and the non-oil sectors. Two
complementary actions will be considered in this regard: public investment in infrastructure to
help address the supply-side bottlenecks; and the cost of doing business will be reduced,
including improvement in business registration, and the legal and regulatory framework for
business, and contract enforcement.
In order to improve policy design and strengthen analytical work on development issues, the
authorities are making progress in improving coverage of the statistical system (quality,
coverage, and timeliness). In addition, surveys to assess policy implementation and poverty
levels will be undertaken.
The authorities are aware of the challenges associated with the efficient management of natural
resources and the need for transparency and good governance. In this context, they understand
that adherence to the Extractive Industry Transparency Initiative (EITI) will be important. In
addition, they feel that further measures to render sustained gains, in terms of improvement of
public financial management, need to be looked at in a more comprehensive way. They are
therefore committed to comprehensive reforms to align the government's public financial

4

management practices to the international best practices; and have thus completed a Fiscal
ROSC during 2006 to direct their actions to cover the gap between the current practices and the
international best practices.
Conclusion
Angola's economic, social and political situation is experiencing a remarkable transformation.
The recovery process continues under a more stabilized macroeconomic environment. The
economic performance has been strong as a result of enhanced reforms. The authorities
understand the importance of a closer engagement, dialogue, and frequent exchange of views to
provide opportunities to improve policy design, implementation, and monitoring in Angola and
will remain committed to improving the ongoing dialogue with the Fund.
Angola continues to face challenges towards improved living standards of its population and
meet the MDGs. Despite its significant natural resources, Angola needs the support of
international partners including TA to advance its reform agenda steadily. The authorities look
forward to positive outcomes in their current effort with the Paris Club creditors and request the
Fund to continue to provide the necessary support.
