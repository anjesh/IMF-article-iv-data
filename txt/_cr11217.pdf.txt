I. CONTEXT
1.
Kuwait faced the global financial crisis from a position of strength. The
government posted large saving rates during the pre-crisis boom years, which allowed it to
accumulate large external buffers in the form of foreign assets and placed it in a relatively
strong fiscal and external position to address the impact of the crisis. In this context, the
government launched a four year development plan (DP) in early 2010—which emphasizes
much needed investment in health, education, and infrastructure—with the objective of
transforming Kuwait into a regional trade and financial center, while expanding the role of
the private sector in the economy.1 Kuwaiti nationals account for 1.1 million, just over
30 percent of the country’s 3.6 million population and are predominantly employed in the
public sector while the private sector is largely dependent on expatriate labor.
An expansionary fiscal position and moderate recovery in nonoil GDP growth
2.
Activity in the non-oil sector has recovered. Real GDP growth in 2010 is estimated
at 3.3 percent, comprising oil growth of 3.2 percent and non-oil growth of 3.4 percent.
Activity has been driven mostly by government expenditure; credit growth was small (Figure
1), with lending growth of

stabilize the global market.

Overall, the government’s cost of the plan is estimated at $55 billion (about 42 percent of 2010 GDP), which
is expected to be matched by the private sector through public-private participation and the establishment of
joint stock companies.

4
3.
The fiscal stance has been expansionary. Government expenditure in FY2010/11—
excluding energy-related subsidies and recapitalization of social security—is estimated to
have increased by 21½ percent. Half of this growth was attributable to the recent Amiri grant,
which offset the under-implementation of the budget.2 Higher international oil prices
bolstered revenue with oil export receipts increasing by 19 percent. In 2010, fiscal and
external surpluses are estimated at about 21 and 28 percent of GDP, respectively, compared
to 28 and 24 percent in 2009.
Figure 2. Inflation Developments, 2001–10

4.
Headline inflation increased
in 2010, primarily due to higher
international food prices. Average
food inflation reached about 8.2 percent
in 2010 (9.8 percent at end-April 2011),
compared to 3.4 percent in 2009, but its
impact on Kuwaiti citizens has been
mitigated by the Amiri grant (Figure 2).
Non-food inflation remains subdued at
around 3.6 percent as of April 2011,
reflecting moderate increases in rents.3

5.
The relationship between the government and parliament remains tense. After a
short-lived improvement in relations in 2010, tensions reignited in the latter part of the year
and pressures on the government led to its resignation in late March 2011—the sixth cabinet
resignation in the past five years. A new government was formed by the reappointed prime
minister but disputes on economic and political issues have persisted and led to the
resignation of the Deputy Prime Minister for Economic Affairs in mid-June. Several
members of parliament also have voiced their intention to go ahead with earlier plans to
question key ministers.
Banking sector strong but continued weaknesses in investment companies
6.
Banks’ profitability and capitalization have improved but the Investment
Companies (ICs) sector continued to post losses. Profits of local banks increased by
70 percent in 2010 and capitalization strengthened further. ICs continued to struggle and

The grant included a transfer of KD 1,000 (about $3,600) in cash to each Kuwaiti citizen (equivalent to
almost 3 percent of 2010 GDP) and the provision of free essential food items from February 2011 through
March 2012.

Recent international oil price increases did not have an impact on the CPI because Kuwait has generous oilrelated subsidies (fuel, electricity, and water) and retail oil-related prices are not adjusted with international
price movements.

5
posted losses on average in 2010—although at a lower level than average losses in 2009—
and the debt restructuring of some ICs remains unresolved.4
7.
The performance of the nonfinancial corporate sector has improved in 2010,
notwithstanding the continued drag by the real estate sector. The corporate sector’s net
profits increased by 170 percent in 2010, but the real estate sector continued to post losses at
levels similar to those in 2009.5 With the exception of the real estate sector, the debt service
capacity of the corporate sector improved significantly, and corporates’ financial positions
were strengthened by higher cash cushions. On average, corporates’ leverage and resilience
to interest rate and income shocks have improved, although these improvements were not
observed in the weaker corporates.6
II. ECONOMIC OUTLOOK AND RISKS
Stronger recovery in 2011 accompanied by larger fiscal and current account surpluses
8.
The economy is expected to grow steadily in 2011 and over the medium term as
the government implements the DP and global recovery supports demand for oil
(Box 1). Real GDP is projected to increase by about 5 percent, reflecting an increase in oil
GDP of about 3¼ percent and non-oil GDP of 6 percent, spurred by government spending.7
Inflation is projected to pick up in 2011 to about 6¼ percent, driven by imported inflation.
9.
The fiscal and current account balances are expected to improve further in 2011.
Despite projected growth of 12 percent in FY2011/12 expenditure, the fiscal balance is
expected to improve by almost 5½ percentage points to 26 percent of GDP on account of
higher oil revenue. The external current account balance is projected to increase to
33½ percent of GDP. Broad money is projected to increase by about 16 percent on account of
the Amiri grant, with credit to the private sector rising by over 6 percent on account of
private sector involvement in DP project implementation.

4

As of May 9, 2011, of the 97 investment companies, six companies have completed the restructuring of their
debt and three companies have entered into debt restructuring negotiations.
5

While the trend in the residential and investment real estate market appears positive, the commercial real
estate sector has excess supply. The Kuwait Investment Authority (KIA) announced in early 2011 the
establishment of a KD1bn portfolio ($3.6bn or 2 percent of 2011 GDP) for investment in the local commercial
real estate market, which might improve conditions in that market.

7

See Chapter 3 in the associated Selected Issues Paper.

Nonoil GDP growth is projected to trend slightly downwards in the medium-term following a similar pattern
of government expenditure growth, which is expected to peak in 2011–12.

6
Internal and external factors pose risks to the outlook
10.
The outlook is subject to domestic downside risks. The overarching risk would be
associated with a significant shortfall in meeting DP spending targets. Red tape, bureaucratic
hurdles, and political gridlock could delay project implementation, discourage private sector
participation, and limit progress on necessary legislative reforms. Separately, with regard to
ICs, a further deterioration in their balance sheets or delays in their restructuring could result
in an increase in banking sector provisions. This scenario could weigh down on banks’
profitability.
Box 1. Kuwait: Multipliers of Government Expenditure 1/
How will the government’s Development Plan (DP) impact nonoil economic activity? This
is an important question for Kuwait’s policymakers, given the broad spectrum of expenditures
that the government is planning to undertake.
Econometric estimates conducted by staff suggests that increasing government
expenditure by one Kuwaiti Dinar (in real terms) will produce an increase in (real) nonoil
GDP in the range of 0.9 to 1.3 Kuwaiti Dinars (i.e., the expenditure multiplier is 0.9–1.3).
Also, multipliers seem to vary by type of government expenditure: for instance, the multiplier
of government capital expenditure is estimated at almost 2¾. Furthermore, the analyses suggest
that most of the impact of government expenditure tends to take place in the implementation
year, but there is some evidence that capital expenditure may impact nonoil GDP also after one
year of its implementation.
Overall, the multipliers reported above are qualitatively consistent with those found in
the literature of fiscal multipliers, but larger in quantitative terms. Four factors may
explain these quantitative differences. First, Kuwait’s government expenditure has been mostly
financed by oil revenues. Accordingly, the increase in expenditure has not been accompanied
by an increase in taxes, which would reduce the net impact on aggregate demand. Second,
Kuwait’s labor supply is highly elastic in light of its dependence on expatriate labor. This
alleviates wage pressures, which could ultimately slow growth. Third, staff analyses focused
on expenditure types that are expected to have a direct impact on aggregate demand (e.g., the
analyses excluded transfers by the central government to the social security fund). This is
likely to produce higher multipliers than when using broader measures of government
expenditure. Fourth, staff analyses focused on a subsector of the economy—the nonoil sector—
while other studies have focused on total GDP, which could result in a lower multiplier.
Interestingly, expenditure multipliers appear to be high despite the large share of imports
in the economy. Staff analyses suggest that the high correlation between government
expenditure and imports operates through higher nonoil GDP activity (i.e. government
expenditure→nonoil GDP→imports) rather than direct leakage through imports.

11.
Deterioration in the regional political and economic environment, particularly
Bahrain and Egypt, also poses risks for Kuwait. Spillover channels would be mainly
financial and include: (i) losses on Kuwaiti investment in the GCC and the MENA region,
which could put further pressure on ICs; (ii) direct exposure of Kuwaiti banks to the region;
and (iii) stricter access to and a higher cost of external funding for Kuwaiti entities in the
short-term (Figure 3). The materialization of regional risks would likely be accompanied by
an increase in oil prices, which would mitigate the impact of this scenario on Kuwait.

12.
The economic outlook could face downside risks from developments in oil prices
and international financial markets. Kuwait has the financial strength to smooth out the
impact of short-term oil price fluctuations on expenditure, and its fiscal and current account
breakeven oil prices (at $51 and $35 per barrel, respectively) remain significantly lower than
current prices. Nevertheless, if global recovery is derailed and results in sustained low oil
prices, prospects for government expenditure in Kuwait might be affected.
13.
The authorities noted that they were closely monitoring the impact of regional
developments on the financial sector. The impact on investments and credit portfolios has
been manageable. They did not expect any significant impact on the cost of and access to
external funding, citing adequate capacity by investors to differentiate risks.
III. POLICY DISCUSSIONS
14.
The discussions focused on near- and medium-term economic and financial
policies. The main issues centered on a strategy for sustained economic growth; mediumterm fiscal reform; near-term economic policies; and measures to maintain financial stability.

8
A. Near-term Macroeconomic Policy Mix
15.
The projected continued fiscal stimulus is expected to support recovery in the
non-oil sector but should be moderated if signs of overheating emerge. The non-oil fiscal
deficit is estimated to have increased by close to 6½ percentage points in FY2010/11 with a
projected decrease of 1 percentage point in FY2011/12.8 The planned increase in capital
expenditure and associated purchases of goods and services should have a strong
contemporaneous impact on nonoil growth due to high fiscal multipliers (Box 1).9 Capital
spending would also support medium- and long-term diversification efforts by addressing
infrastructure needs and strengthening expenditure on health and education. Continued fiscal
stimulus is appropriate at this juncture in light of modest nonoil GDP recovery in 2010, weak
private sector investment, and moderate non-food inflationary pressures.10 Nevertheless,
expenditure should be moderated if signs of overheating emerge, particularly in housing
services, notably rents.11 Staff welcomes progress made toward the establishment of a macrofiscal unit at the Ministry of Finance and plans to move to performance-based budgeting.
16.
Monetary policy is expected to remain accommodative, reflecting the basket peg
and low global interest rates. During the past year the CBK adjusted its policy rates in line
with domestic credit conditions and low global interest rates and significant public sector
deposits were maintained in the banking system, which have boosted liquidity (Figure 4).12
Exchange rate movements could have some role in offsetting the pass-through of commodity
price increases, although this is limited by the presumed large weight of the U.S. dollar in the
currency basket (Figure 5).

8

The non-oil fiscal balance used here excludes investment income, pension recapitalization, and oil-related
subsidies. The non-oil deficit is estimated at over 54½ percent and 53 percent in FY2010/11 and FY2011/12,
respectively, compared to approximately 49 percent in the years preceding the crisis (FY2005/06 to
FY2007/08).

9

Staff estimates that the impact on growth of the recent household package, which is largely in the form of
direct cash transfers, is likely to be limited as a large part is likely to be saved.
10

Domestic inflation is projected to trend upward as recovery takes hold, but is likely to remain low in light of
excess supply in the commercial real estate sector, the expected increase in the supply of housing units, and the
high elasticity of the labor market. Oil-related subsidies contribute to containing nonfood and nonfuel inflation
to the extent that they contain the price of transportation and electricity and thereby the price of goods and
services.

11

At this point, nonoil GDP is still estimated to be below potential. The accompanying regional background
paper includes an estimation of the output gap for Kuwait and also a discussion of the caveats of output gap
estimation for GCC countries.

12

In a 2009 study on GCC monetary policy, Bova and Senhadji find that Kuwait followed the U.S. monetary
policy less closely than the other GCG countries. They note that the currency basket allowed for more flexibility
in the exchange rate and in monetary policy. The extent of divergence from U.S. monetary policy within the
GCC in general was found to be higher after the recent global crisis, and interest rate adjustments took longer
time.

17.
Macroprudential policies are of particular importance in Kuwait. While fiscal
policy should be the first line of defense to manage the financial cycle that is typically
associated with the oil cycle, macroprudential policies are essential to dampen cyclical
fluctuations in credit and to maintain financial stability (see Chapter 4 in the associated
Selected Issues Paper).
18.
Assessment of the real exchange rate suggests that the dinar is broadly in line
with fundamentals. The equilibrium real exchange rate approach suggests that the dinar is
undervalued in the range of 0–10 percent, on the basis of both annual and high frequency
estimation methods. The macrobalance approach suggests a medium-term current account
surplus norm in the range of 32 to 42 percent of GDP, implying either an undervaluation of
4 percent or an overvaluation of 17 percent. The external sustainability approach (using a
constant per capita annuity rule), which is very sensitive to assumed parameters, suggests

10
that the real exchange rate is overvalued by 12 percent. While the different approaches
produce mixed results—the misalignment ranges from an overvaluation of 17 percent to an
undervaluation of 10 percent—the average across the three approaches indicate an
overvaluation of just 4½ percent. On balance, the estimates indicate that the real exchange
rate is broadly in line with fundamentals. Subdued domestic inflation and the lack of pressure
on the currency forward markets support this assessment.13

19.
The authorities noted that they did not expect inflation to pick up in the near
term. In particular, there continues to be excess capacity in real estate and significant leakage
of government expenditure occurs through the balance of payments. On policy instruments,
they argued that the basket peg provided sufficient monetary policy flexibility and that they
had in place a number of macroprudential tools that could be time-varying depending on
conditions, but they were ready to consider others.14 They highlighted the sustained deviation
of domestic interest rates from the U.S., both with respect to timing and the extent of interest
rate reductions. While the authorities agreed with the findings of the exchange rate
assessment, they noted that these assessments were highly sensitive to the assumed future oil
price path and other parameters.

14

See Chapter 3 in the associated Selected Issues Paper.

The authorities noted that they had in place a loan-to-deposits ratio, liquidity ratio, higher risk weights for
certain portfolios, and precautionary provisions. They added that they used credit growth limits during the boom
period that preceded the global crisis.

11
B. Strategy for Sustained Economic Growth
20.
The DP rightly puts weight on needed investment but its implementation should
be managed carefully. The DP emphasizes much needed investment in health, education,
and infrastructure, particularly the preparation of Kuwaiti nationals for private sector
employment. In all three areas, Kuwait fares relatively low vis-à-vis international
comparisons, taking into account its GDP per capita level (Appendix I). The DP is also
expected to have an important impact on short- and medium-term growth, particularly in
light of weak private sector activity. Staff noted that implementation weaknesses and
distortions should be addressed to achieve the DP’s objectives.


DP implementation. The DP envisages significant participation of the private sector
through the establishment of public shareholding companies. Effective DP
implementation requires: (i) the enhancement of the business environment and
development of streamlined procedures and processes and the needed legislative base
for efficient and timely project screening and implementation;15 (ii) project design for
developmental projects that provides appropriate internal rates of return while
limiting fiscal risks within a proper framework for risk sharing between the public
and private sectors; (iii) ensuring adequate outcomes by evaluating the viability of
projects and conducting regular reviews of the productivity of spending, including
achieving the project’s qualitative targets on health and education; (iv) that absorptive
capacity and supply constraints are taken into account to avoid the resurgence of
inflation; and (v) no buildup of excessive private sector leverage. Initiatives to
diversify financing channels, including through the development of a corporate debt
market, should be pursued.

Labor sector policies. A key objective of the DP is to increase the participation of
Kuwaitis in private sector activities but labor policies are generally inconsistent with
this objective (Box 2). The government provides generous public sector
compensation packages raising the reservation wage of nationals for private sector
jobs, which undermines efforts by the government to promote private sector
employment. The government also relies on administrative measures (minimum
sectoral quotas for the participation of Kuwaiti nationals) which are largely
ineffective but nevertheless create further distortions. Consistent labor sector policies,
including containing the growth in the wage bill, would help get the incentives right
for Kuwaiti nationals and limit recurring, excessive increases in current expenditure.

15

Kuwait consistently scores lower than the GCC average in measures of the business environment. Although it
ranked relatively highly overall in the 2009 World Economic Forum’s Global Competitiveness index, Kuwait’s
ranking (35th) was below the GCC average of 28. Kuwait received significantly lower scores in “Doing
Business Indicators” with very weak performance in the areas of starting a business, trading across borders, and
enforcing contracts.

12
Staff welcomes the initiative by the authorities to target better education outcomes
and training.
Box 2. Kuwait—Labor Market Issues
The private sector in Kuwait is largely dependent on expatriate labor. Available data indicate that
the annual average growth rate of the Kuwait labor force was 4 percent in 2002–09, with 86 thousand
Kuwaitis entering the labor market during the period. While close to 700 thousand jobs were created
by the private sector in the past decade, Kuwaitis remain primarily employed in the public sector
(83 percent) and constitute less than 10 percent of the private sector labor force. Expatriates are
employed mostly in the private sector (64 percent) or as domestic workers (29 percent). Nevertheless, a
significant share of expatriate jobs is low-skilled, with 54 percent of expatriates assessed as having no
qualification. As regards the Kuwaiti workforce, only 12 percent hold employment in technical or
scientific professions.
A key objective of the Development Plan is to increase the participation of Kuwaitis in private
sector activities, but labor policies are generally inconsistent with this objective. This objective is
supported by Law 19 of 2000, which sets out generous government-provided benefits to Kuwaitis
employed in the private sector—including a social allowance, a living expense allowance, and a child
allowance—to enhance the attractiveness of private sector jobs. Nevertheless, the effectiveness of the
Law is undermined by high and rising public sector wages and benefits. Moreover, the policy of
“Kuwaitization” (minimum sectoral quotas for the participation of Kuwaiti nationals) is circumvented
by employers, largely due to a skills mismatch and high reservation wages.

The authorities were in broad agreement with staff’s assessment of the DP and
its challenges, while noting that delays were inevitable in the first year of the DP
implementation. They attributed delays to the lack of readiness of the legislative base and
noted their intention to accelerate work on this front. They expected implementation
performance to improve in the current fiscal year. The authorities acknowledged the need to
address the growth of the wage bill, but noted that they did not expect any near-term reforms
on this front. As regards the development of the debt market, they noted that a law that would
allow sukuk issuance by government was currently under consideration by the Council of
Ministers.
C. Medium-term Fiscal Reform
22.
Medium-to-long-term fiscal reforms are essential to reduce distortions. Fiscal
distortions in the form of large subsidies and the low contribution of nonoil revenue to the
budget will likely be exacerbated as growth picks up. The cost of domestic subsidies,
particularly those related to utilities (electricity and water) and fuel, will continue to increase
as the economy expands (Box 3).16 Subsidies, low taxation, and rapid growth in current
expenditure (including the public sector wage bill) imply high and inefficient transfers of oil
resources to the nonoil economy.
23.
Fiscal consolidation is required to achieve intergenerational equity in the
consumption of oil wealth. While an assessment of long-term sustainability of fiscal policy
that takes into account intergenerational equity is highly sensitive to the parameters involved
in the calculation, staff estimates suggest that the government’s medium-term non-oil deficit
is somewhat above its long-term sustainable value, and this gap is projected to widen over
time (Box 4). Furthermore, current expenditures have expanded rapidly in recent years—
largely on account of increases in wages, subsidies, and transfers—increasing breakeven
prices for the fiscal and external balances and raising fiscal vulnerability to the volatility
of oil prices.

16

Oil-related subsidies account for about 95 percent of subsidies, and they derive primarily from the sale of
subsidized fuels for transportation and for production and distribution of electricity and water. Food subsidies
cover a few basic products.

14
Box 3. Kuwait: The Composition of Government Expenditure—A Case for
Subsidy Reform?
The size of government expenditure with respect to nonoil GDP has fluctuated
substantially in Kuwait over the past three decades. Overall, a downward trend that started
in 1992 has been reversed since FY2005/06. In FY2010/11 government expenditure was about
77 percent of nonoil GDP, just 1¼ percentage points below its 25-year average.

growth and the associated

consumption of electricity and water.
While oil-related subsidies/benefits can be viewed as a mechanism for the sharing of oil
wealth, they are largely untargeted and, as a result, increase inefficient consumption of
utilities and/or disproportionally benefit high-income groups. Accordingly, a better
targeting of subsidies/benefits and a reallocation of the expenditure envelope toward capital
expenditure could go a long way in improving the efficiency and productivity of government
expenditure.
___________
1/ For this box we focus on primary government expenditures (i.e., excluding interest payments) and
remove payments for pension fund recapitalization. We also exclude the period related to the Iraqi
invasion (i.e., FY1990/91 and 1991/92).

15
Box 4. Kuwait: Fiscal Sustainability Analysis
The analysis of long-term fiscal sustainability—broadly defined as the government’s
capacity to provide a stable path of expenditure—provides a useful benchmark for oil
exporting countries, which have to make fiscal policy decisions that take into account the
future depletion of oil resources. While the results are quite sensitive to the assumptions of
difficult-to-predict parameters such as future oil prices and population growth, it nonetheless
provides useful guidance, and can be complemented with alternative scenarios to assess the
robustness of the results. 1/
Fiscal sustainability analysis conducted by staff suggests that Kuwait’s nonoil deficit
should be reduced in the medium-term to ensure long-term sustainability. In the baseline
scenario (left panel), the non-oil fiscal deficit is estimated to be in equilibrium in FY2011/12,
but around 3 percentage points of GDP over its equilibrium by 2016/17. Assuming a lower
rate of population growth, the non-oil fiscal deficit remains below its equilibrium in the
medium-term, but the margin between the two declines over time.
When assuming lower oil prices (right panel), the nonoil deficit becomes larger than its
equilibrium by FY2011/12 indicating the need for earlier fiscal consolidation. Fiscal
consolidation would be essential under this scenario, even in the case of lower population growth,
as the projected nonoil deficit becomes higher than its low population growth equilibrium in the
medium-term.

the oil price to reach $98.5 per barrel in 2016 and remain constant in real terms
thereafter. The alternative calculation assumes long-term population growth of 1.4

_________
1/ In this exercise, long-term sustainability assumes intergenerational equity by calculating a constant real
per capita government expenditure path (and related nonoil deficit) that delivers a constant real per capita
annuity to finance government expenditures after oil revenues are exhausted. The non-oil deficit calculations
discussed above refer to the non-oil deficit excluding investment income.

16
24.

Policy options for medium-to-long-term fiscal reforms include:



Reforms to the tax system. Staff welcomes the planned introduction of VAT in 2013
in conjunction with the planned GCC-wide VAT implementation. While the
government is also considering the introduction of a comprehensive income tax
system (personal and corporate), staff suggested that priority should be placed on the
implementation of the latter in light of capacity constraints.



A gradual reduction of untargeted subsidies. The phased withdrawal of subsidies
should be a high priority, complemented by efficient and well-targeted safety nets.
The results of the recent census could form the basis for the establishment of such a
system.



A fiscal rule would be useful for medium-term fiscal management. Because of the
volatility of revenue and intergenerational equity considerations, the fiscal rule should
yield a relatively high public savings rate. A robust fiscal anchor could consist of an
expenditure ceiling that would require that windfall revenues are largely saved while
allowing for wider fiscal deficits when oil revenues are below forecast.17 The fiscal
framework could incorporate explicit “escape clauses” in the event of severe shocks.

25.
The authorities were in broad agreement with the need to diversify revenue
sources and reduce the growth in current expenditure. They noted that efforts to diversify
budget revenues have already started; non-oil revenue was targeted to grow to KD 4 billion
by the end of the DP period (FY2013/14) from KD 1.1 billion (6¼ percent of non-oil GDP)
in FY2009/10, through adjustments to fees, customs, and taxation. VAT preparations were
well underway and will be implemented jointly with the rest of the GCC countries, but there
was growing uncertainty regarding the implementation date. A comprehensive income tax
was scheduled to be implemented by end-FY2013/14. While there was no intention at this
time to undertake subsidy reform, work is underway on improving bill collection and the
repricing formula for utilities. On budget planning and performance, they noted that they
planned to move to a performance based budgeting in eight years. The authorities
acknowledged that there were downside risks to achieving their targets, largely due to
potential delays on the legislative front.

17

An example of an expenditure rule is a cap on nominal or real expenditure growth consistent with a credible
medium-term budget framework.

D. Bolstering Financial Sector Monitoring and Regulation
26.
The banking system is now in a stronger position to finance the DP. Private sector
participation in the DP requires a well-functioning banking system to provide the needed
project financing. In this context, the marked improvements in bank’s financial positions in
2010 are encouraging. Following significant recapitalization through capital injection and
subordinated debt issuance, the

owing to significant write-offs of fully-provisioned loans following a newly issued CBK
directive. Nevertheless, under CBK instruction, banks continued their precautionary
provisioning policies in 2010 and 2011 to cover potentially risky exposures. The sector’s
profits increased significantly in 2010 (by approximately 70 percent) owing to a decline in
loan loss provisions, and return on equity (ROE) reached 9.1 percent. Liquidity appears
adequate owing to a stable deposit base, including significant public sector deposits, although
liquidity ratios have been on a downward trend in recent years and the CBK should continue
to monitor it.
27.
The financial situation of many ICs remains precarious. Several companies
continued posting significant losses in 2010, originating mostly from investment in equities
and real estate. External financing still accounts for a significant share of ICs’ liabilities at
approximately 25 percent as of December 2010. This long struggling sector may face
renewed pressures, although the impact on the banking sector is expected to be manageable
in the near-term, owing to the high loan provisions already built-up against this sector.
Despite significant deleveraging after Lehman’s collapse, ICs remain highly dependent on
foreign financing (Figure 7). The sector has hit setbacks in terms of debt restructuring and, if
regional real estate and equity prices continue to be negatively affected by the regional
political unrest and access to external financing tightens, balance sheet and liquidity
pressures might mount. Market participants expect some consolidation in the sector, although
18

In 2010, four banks increased their capital by a total of KD 466 million ($1.7 billion).

18
this could be limited by the prevalence of family business groups, which constrains the
potential for mergers, and the absence of an efficient and speedy resolution framework and
lack of financial expertise in the court system.

28.
Stress test results indicate that, while the banking sector could broadly
withstand significant shocks, ICs remain vulnerable. Stress tests conducted by staff show
improved results compared to 2009, owing to higher capitalization and liquidity buffers as
well as large precautionary provisions (Appendix II).19 Under the most adverse scenario—
which assumes a significant drop in oil and asset prices and protracted low growth over a
year—no bank loses its entire capital despite a marked deterioration in the loan portfolio. The
maximum recapitalization need estimated under this scenario to restore the CAR to the
statutory 12 percent requirement, would not exceed 2 percent of GDP. Single factor stress
test results still underscore the vulnerability of the banking sector to exposure to the real
estate and equity markets but the recapitalization needs under the severe scenarios in these
tests appear manageable. Liquidity stress test results also indicate that banks can broadly
withstand a liquidity shock, although one bank becomes illiquid under the severe scenario.
To this effect, the authorities should continue to ensure that banks hold adequate liquid assets
to cushion against stressful events. ICs included in the stress test sample continue to show
very limited capacity to withstand shocks.20 Under the severe scenario the capital of eight
(out of eleven) ICs could be wiped out due to insufficient capital buffers and exposure to
risky assets.
29.
The authorities made significant progress in the implementation of the 2010
FSAP recommendations (Appendix III). New ICs regulations were issued by the CBK in
June 2010, setting prudential limits on liquidity, leverage, and foreign exposure. The Capital
Market Authority (CMA) has issued its full set of bylaws and is expected to assume its
supervisory role in September 2011. A MoU between the CBK and CMA is currently being
drafted to delineate their respective supervisory responsibilities over ICs and specify the
coordination process. A core team has been set up in the CBK with the aim of strengthening
macroprudential supervision and significant progress has been made in the identification and
design of analytical tools, including a quarterly off-site surveillance report, stress tests, and
an early warning system (EWS) drawing on micro and macro financial and economic data.
Major improvements have also been noted in banking sector data collection and analysis and
migration into a risk-based supervisory system.
30.
Improvement in financial sector regulation and supervision are welcome, but
further steps are warranted. The authorities should ensure the finalization of the MoU
between the CBK and CMA in a manner that closes gaps and limits overlap to ensure
efficient oversight architecture. Any legal impediments to the sharing of information between
the two authorities (e.g., banking secrecy provisions) should be removed. Moreover, the
CMA should ensure adequate staffing, both quantitatively and qualitatively, at a level
19

The 2010 FSAP methodology and assumptions were used in the stress test updates for comparability
purposes.

20

The sample included 11 listed ICs with a 29 percent share of total ICs’ assets.

20
commensurate with the development stage of the financial sector and sophistication of the
financial instruments. With regard to macroprudential supervision, the authorities could
explore the establishment of an inter-agency financial stability committee for systemic risk
monitoring and crisis management. In regard to ICs, the CBK should continue to monitor
progress toward the 2012 deadline for compliance with the quantitative regulations of the
CBK and ensure that companies are undertaking needed restructuring. In this connection, to
facilitate efficient restructuring processes and exits, it is important to move expeditiously to
establish a special resolution regime (SRR) for financial institutions.21 Special courts could
also be considered to adjudicate the process in case of challenges.
31.
The authorities started the establishment of their Anti-Money laundering and
Combating the Financing of Terrorism (AML/CFT) framework in 2002. Nevertheless,
the framework needs further strengthening in a number of areas, particularly the
criminalization of the financing of terrorism, the structure and functions of the Financial
Intelligence Unit, and the AML/CFT supervisory system. The authorities should draw upon
the recommendations of the assessment report adopted in June 2011. As part of this process,
a new AML/CFT Law, which complies with the Financial Action Task Force 40+9
recommendations, will need to be quickly adopted.
32.
The authorities considered IC risk to be modest with minimal impact on banks.
They noted that banks were now adequately provisioned against loans to ICs and could
withstand further deterioration in this loan portfolio although such an event would be likely
to affect banks’ profitability. They expected a need for additional provisioning in 2011 and
the first half of 2012. They also acknowledged that the transfer of supervision of ICs from
the CBK to the CMA presented a significant challenge, particularly since the CMA was at its
early stages of inception and still lacked adequate staffing. They noted their preference to
limit dual supervision, although that might not be possible in some cases. On the resolution
framework, they noted that special clauses related to the resolution of financial institutions
could be introduced as part of the planned amendment of the Commercial Law, rather than as
a standalone law.
E. Other Issues
33.
Progress has been made in improving Kuwait’s statistical system, but further
work is needed. The CBK prepares and publishes comprehensive and timely monetary and
financial statistics and has recently made significant progress in improving the compilation,
coverage, and periodicity of the BOP data with the help of Fund TA, although IIP and
external debt data are still provided with some lag. Following the change in the
21

The resolution framework will need to cater to the different nature of activities and the risk associated with
them. For example, the resolution framework for ICs may focus on aspects of segregation of client’s assets,
custody, and collateral.

21
organizational structure and leadership of the Central Statistical Office (CSO), the long lags
in the compilation of CPI data have been eliminated. Preparation of national accounts at
constant prices continues to be delayed, with the latest data covering 2007. The authorities
are encouraged to provide the necessary financial and institutional support to the CSO to
ensure that plans to improve the quality and frequency of dissemination of statistics in these
areas are achieved.
IV. STAFF APPRAISAL
34.
GDP recovered in 2010, supported by an expansionary fiscal position. Real GDP
growth, estimated at 3.3 percent, was largely driven by government expenditure, which have
increased in FY2010/11 by 21½ percent—excluding energy-related subsidies and
recapitalization of social security. Inflation inched up, primarily due to higher international
food prices. The regional unrest has weighed on stock market prices, similar to other
countries in the region. At the same time, Kuwait has increased its oil production to assist in
the effort to stabilize the global oil market.
35.
The economy is expected to grow steadily in 2011 and over the medium term as
the government continues to implement the DP and global recovery supports demand
for oil. Real GDP is projected to increase by about 5 percent and inflation is projected to pick
up, driven by imported inflation. The fiscal and external balances are expected to improve on
account of higher oil revenue.
36.
The outlook is subject to downside risks. The overarching domestic risk would be
associated with a significant shortfall in meeting the spending targets of the DP. Red tape and
political gridlock could delay project implementation, discourage private sector participation,
and limit progress on necessary legislative reforms. Deterioration in the regional political and
economic environment, particularly Bahrain and Egypt, also poses risks for Kuwait.
Spillover channels would be mainly financial, including losses on Kuwaiti regional
investment and direct exposure of Kuwaiti banks to the region. Finally, prospects for
government expenditure in Kuwait might be affected if the global recovery is derailed,
leading to a sustained decline in oil prices.
37.
The near-term macro policy mix is adequate. Nevertheless, the projected continued
fiscal expansion should be moderated if signs of overheating emerge. Monetary policy
remains subject to the constraints associated with the exchange rate regime. Accordingly, if
demand pressures were to reemerge, macroprudential policies will be largely responsible for
maintaining financial stability. The exchange rate is broadly in line with fundamentals and
the basket peg remains appropriate in the run up to the GCC monetary union.

22
38.
DP implementation should be managed carefully. The DP rightly puts significant
weight on much needed investment, with emphasis on preparing Kuwaiti nationals for
private sector employment. For effective implementation of the DP, the authorities
should enhance the business environment and develop supportive legislation; ensure the
viability of projects and productivity of spending; take into account absorptive capacity and
supply constraints to avoid the resurgence of inflation; and avoid buildup of excessive private
sector leverage. The development of a corporate debt market should be pursued. Containing
the growth in the public sector wage bill would be needed to get the incentives right for
Kuwaiti nationals.
39.
Medium-to-long-term fiscal reforms are essential to reduce distortions and
ensure intergenerational equity in the distribution of oil wealth. Untargeted subsidies,
low taxation, and rapid growth in current expenditure imply high and inefficient transfers of
oil resources to the nonoil economy. Furthermore, the steady growth in current expenditures
has raised the breakeven prices for the fiscal and external balances, increasing their
vulnerability to the volatility of oil prices. As a result, the medium-term non-oil deficit is
somewhat above its long-term sustainable value, and this gap is projected to widen over time.
Medium-to-long-term reforms should include tax and subsidy reforms; a better targeting of
subsidies/benefits and a reallocation of the expenditure envelope toward capital expenditure
could go a long way in improving the efficiency and productivity of government expenditure.
A fiscal rule would be useful for medium-term fiscal management.
40.
The financial positions of banks improved markedly in 2010 but the financial
situation of many investment companies (ICs) remains precarious. Stress tests conducted
by staff indicate that the banking system could reasonably withstand significant credit and
liquidity shocks, although bank liquidity should continue to be monitored closely. On the
other hand, stress tests point to the ICs’ limited capacity to withstand adverse shocks. Several
ICs continued to post losses in 2010 and, despite significant recent deleveraging, they remain
highly dependent on foreign financing while hitting setbacks in terms of debt restructuring. If
regional real estate and equity prices continue to be negatively affected by the regional
political unrest and access to external financing tightens, balance sheet and liquidity
pressures might mount. Banks are now adequately provisioned against loans to ICs and can
withstand additional deterioration in this loan portfolio, but such an event is likely to weigh
down on banks’ profitability. In this regard, the CBK should continue to monitor ICs’
progress toward the 2012 deadline for compliance with the quantitative regulations of the
CBK and ensure that companies are undertaking needed restructuring. To facilitate efficient
restructuring processes and exits, it is important to move expeditiously to establish a special
resolution regime (SRR) for financial institutions. Special courts could also be considered to
adjudicate the process in case of challenges.

23
41.
The authorities made significant progress in the implementation of the 2010
FSAP update recommendations, but further steps are warranted. The MoU that is
currently being drafted between the Central Bank of Kuwait and the newly established CMA
should close gaps and limit overlap to ensure efficient oversight architecture, and any legal
impediments to the sharing of information between the two authorities (e.g., banking secrecy
provisions) should be removed. The CMA should ensure adequate staffing commensurate
with the development stage of the financial sector. With regard to macroprudential
supervision, the authorities could explore the establishment of an inter-agency financial
stability committee for systemic risk monitoring and crisis management. Finally, a new
AML/CFT Law, which complies with the Financial Action Task Force 40+9
recommendations, will need to be quickly adopted.
42.
Progress has been made in improving Kuwait’s statistical system, but further
work is needed. The authorities are encouraged to provide the necessary financial and

APPENDIX I. EDUCATION, HEALTH, AND INFRASTRUCTURE IN KUWAIT
1.
Kuwait faces challenges to improve the quality of the health and education
sectors, as well as to upgrade infrastructure. In all three sectors, Kuwait fares relatively
low vis-à-vis international comparisons, taking into account its GDP per capita level.
2.
The long-term growth potential of the economy is linked to the effectiveness of
the health and education sectors. Education is also important to reduce inequality. A World
Bank study of education in the Middle East and North Africa concluded that once basic
education needs have been met, effective participation in secondary and tertiary education
required a complex mix of factors—not just higher spending.1 Accordingly, education reform
should focus on achieving better outcomes and a focus on preparing graduates to meet the
needs of the private sector.
3.
The primary health care system is relatively good but the system has not kept up
with the demand for specialized care, leading to an expensive program to send citizens
abroad for healthcare services.2 The health care infrastructure, such as hospital beds per
capita, is significantly below countries with a comparable income level and the share of
spending in GDP is low.2 Accordingly, there is significant scope to increase the provision of
healthcare services domestically, which will require capital spending and adequate resources
to hire well-trained service providers.
4.
At its current GDP per capita level, the quality of infrastructure in Kuwait is
also relatively poor (see, for example, the indicator on quality of electrical supply).
Additional investment is needed to bring electricity (and roads) up to regional standards.
Investment should target bottlenecks that are a constraint to economic development and to
ease capacity constraints.

APPENDIX II. STRESS TESTING METHODOLOGY AND RESULTS
1.
The CBK has introduced its own stress testing exercise. To date, the CBK has
started its own banking sector stress testing exercise in mid-2010 and has already concluded
one set of stress tests based on March 2010 data. The stress tests included three
macroeconomic scenarios to evaluate the resilience of banks’ solvency to a combination of
adverse shocks including a decline in oil prices, government expenditure, and GDP growth; a
decrease in real estate and stock market prices; a depreciation of the exchange rate; and
deterioration in banks’ liquidity conditions. The stress tests were carried out with the help of
an external consulting firm, and results indicate the resilience of most banks to the shocks.
2.
Staff conducted Banking sector stress tests based on December 2010
consolidated data. The tests covered market, credit, and liquidity risks with single-factor
shocks and macroeconomic scenarios. The stress tests covered the 10 domestic banks, which
account for 97 percent of the banking sector’s assets and were based on consolidated
December 2010 financial statements and supervisory data. Three macroeconomics scenarios
were considered in the solvency tests, ranging from mild to very severe scenarios. In credit
risk stress tests, the losses consisted of increased provisions; in exchange rate stress tests,
they consisted of revaluation gains or losses from net open positions; in interest rate stress
tests, they consisted of net interest income gains or losses using a time to next repricing gap
model that evaluates the impact of a parallel shift in the yield curve; and in equity risk stress
tests they consisted of equity investments revaluation gains or losses. In the liquidity stress
tests, the impact of deposit runs was evaluated on the banks’ ability to service cash outflows
through a fire-sale of their liquid assets with no access to CBK financing for five days.
3.
Staff applied the same increases in the NPL ratio as the 2010 FSAP update
under the three tested scenarios for comparability purposes. The increases were then
mapped into banks’ results through a migration of loans from the performing loan categories
to the non-performing ones (substandard, doubtful, and loan loss) distributed proportionally
according to banks’ initial shares of NPLs in these categories. Using the regulatory
provisioning rates for each loan category and CBK regulation calculation methodology, the
additional NPLs were translated into additional provisions under each scenario. The
methodology accounted for collateral deemed realizable by reducing the loan base on which
the provisioning rate was applied after assuming a haircut on the collateral. Haircut
magnitudes ranged from 10 percent in the mild scenario to 50 percent in the most severe
scenario. Pre-provisioning operating profits and existing precautionary provisions
subsequently formed first buffers against the credit risk losses. The tests covered a one year
span, similar to those conducted under the FSAP.
4.
Single factor credit risk stress tests covered large exposures and sectoral
concentration risks. Large exposure stress tests assumed default of the three largest
exposures of each bank, while sectoral concentration risks stress tests assumed a
deterioration of loans in real estate and construction, investment companies, and loans for

34
securities purchases. The tests assumed a fifty percent haircut of underlying collateral, which
is a fairly conservative assumption given the complex foreclosure procedures and the current
illiquidity condition of the real estate market. Single factor credit risk stress tests also
accounted for existing precautionary provisions.
5.
Single factor market risk stress tests included exchange rate, interest rate, and
equity price risks. The generally limited impact of exchange rate risk is due to the
regulatory restrictions limiting FX-net open positions to 15 percent of Tier I capital. The
indirect impact of foreign exchange also appears contained given reported restrictions on FX
lending to hedged borrowers. The impact of interest rates fluctuations on banks’ net interest
margins did not appear significant owing to the predominance of floating rates loans which
reprice in tandem with short-term deposits (both rates are indexed to the discount rate).
However, lending rates associated with installment loans are subject to a ceiling which gives
rise to some interest rate risk. Fixed income securities—predominantly government
securities— account for 10 percent of banks’ assets. However, these are not mark-to-market
owing to the absence of a secondary market for these securities, which makes the revaluation
impact on the fixed income securities manageable. Conversely, banks’ significant holdings of
equity investments and collateral expose them to stock market price fluctuations. The
banking sector’s direct equity investments constitute 6 percent of total assets, and nearly
40 percent of collateral is held in equity shares. This test has the most significant impact
among single factor market risks.
6.
A liquidity stress test was carried out to test banks’ liquidity to a deposit run
over a five day period without external funding. The liquidity test assumed daily
withdrawals of 10 percent of demand deposits and 5 percent of time deposits for five days. A
haircut of 10 percent was applied to the liquid assets. A bank was considered illiquid when
the sale of its liquid assets did not cover deposit outflows in any specific day.
7.
Stress tests of ICs included 11 listed companies accounting for 29 percent of total
assets. The tests assumed loss rates by asset type1 and geographic location. The impact was
estimated on ICs shareholders’ equity to assets ratio.

1

The asset allocation breakdown included investments in equities, bonds, real estate, hedge funds and private
equities, loan advances, and other assets.

APPENDIX III. FSAP UPDATE 2010: RECOMMENDATIONS IMPLEMENTATION STATUS
(As of May 2011)
Recommendation

Implementation status and details
General
In progress. The chairman of the capital market authority (CMA) has been
appointed and the institution is expected to fully resume its supervisory role in
September 2010. CMA bylaws have been passed, specifying its supervisory
roles over ICs and the finalization of the draft MoU delineating the supervisory
responsibilities of and coordination process between CMA and CBK is
underway. ICs extending credit are expected to remain under the supervision of
the CBK while those engaged in securities dealings will be supervised by the
CMA. Arrangements with respect to areas of overlaps are currently being
worked out.

Establish at the CBK a financial stability unit (FSU) responsible for macroprudential supervision

In progress. Significant progress has been made in this area. A new core team
comprising on - and off-site supervisors has been formed with the help of an
external consultant. Significant progress has been made on the analytical front
and identification of tools that would be used to assess systemic risk. These
include a quarterly off-site surveillance report, banking sector stress testing
(developed during July-October 2010 with the assistance of a consulting firm),
and an early warning system (EWS) that incorporates macro and micro
economic and financial indicators that would be used to signal sector-wide
weaknesses. The FSU is envisaged to draw from interdepartmental
competencies including supervision and macro economic analysis but the
institutional structure is still undecided.

Banking Supervision
Perform periodic stress tests including for real estate and other major sectoral
credit risk concentrations, and review existing assessments of the way banks
consider these risk concentrations in their internal capital adequacy assessment
processes (ICAAPs).

Implemented. The CBK has made significant strides in its data collection and
stress testing capacities with the help of an external consulting firm. Sectoral
stress tests have been carried out by the CBK and the results were shared and
discussed with banks. The CBK has completed an ICAAP manual based on the
June 19, 2009 circular and have completed four ICAAP inspections in 2010.
Three additional ICAAP inspections are scheduled for 2011.

39

The CBK, CMA, and the Ministry of Commerce and Industry (MOCI) should
clarify at the outset their respective supervisory responsibilities and initiate a
coordination process to achieve efficient oversight architecture.

Implementation status and details

Lower the maximum exposure limits on related parties and enhancing the legal
framework to prohibit conflicts of interest concerning related party transactions

Not implemented. The CBK noted that they have started to look into this issue.
Moreover, they argued that they would like to avoid policy contradictions that
could arise from lowering related lending limits and other policies that are
directed at enhancing credit growth (e.g., relaxing the prudential loan/deposit
ratio), particularly in light of the implementation of the Development Plan.

Complete the migration from compliance-based supervision to risk-based
supervision

In progress. An external consultant was appointed to assist the CBK modernize
its supervisory framework into a risk based one, and perform ICAAP
assessments. Four ICAAP assessments have been completed in 2010 and three
more are scheduled for 2011. The CBK intends to use the off-site surveillance
report to identify the work program for the new inspection cycle that will start
in October 2011, including the identification of targeted inspections.

Continue strengthening the supervision capacity through further hiring and
training

Ongoing. A total of 31 on-site and off-site supervisors were recently hired.
Staff in the banking supervision department have benefited over the last year
from several trainings and seminars inside and outside Kuwait.

Shorten the on-site supervision cycle

Not implemented. Nevertheless, with the migration to risk-based supervision,
more frequent and targeted ICCAP bank examinations have strengthened onsite supervision. Additional targeted inspections are expected to take place in
the upcoming inspection cycle.

Organize comprehensive ICAAP on-site examination

Implemented. So far, four ICAAP inspections have been completed, and three
are planned for 2011.

Investment Companies
Strengthen regulations on (a) licensing (in particular “fit and proper” criteria);
(b) permissible activities; (c) corporate governance, including requirements on
internal organization, internal control, risk management, external auditors, and
accountancy rules; and (d) prudential limits on leverage and liquidity/maturity
mismatch.

In progress. The CBK issued new regulations on ICs in June 2010. The new
regulations set prudential limits on liquidity, leverage, and FX exposures. The
CBK set June 2012 as the deadline for full compliance of ICs with the new
regulations. The CBK has postponed any issuance of new regulations on
corporate governance until the delineation of supervisory responsibilities over
ICs is completed. The recently issued CMA bylaws seek to strengthen
corporate governance in ICs by imposing approval of CMA for management,
board members, and other key positions, including the compliance, internal
controls, risk management, and AML/CFT officers. Minimum qualifications
have been established for board members and key officers are required to pass
a certain test specified by the CMA. New listing requirements for listed
companies were also issued (compliance required by March 2012).

40

Recommendation

Recommendation

Implementation status and details

Consideration could also be given to varying the minimum capital requirement
depending on the activities and risks assumed by the entity

Not implemented.

Financial Safety Net Framework
Replace the blanket guarantee with a deposit insurance system which promotes
market discipline, including by introducing a cap at a level that adequately
protects depositors, but provides incentives to conduct due diligence. The
authorities need to define a transition strategy, with a timetable, once conditions
allow.

Not implemented. The authorities believe that it is still premature to remove
the blanket guarantee. Furthermore, in view of the large deposit concentration
in Kuwait (99% of depositors own only 20 percent of deposits), a standard
deposit scheme would not be effective in guarding against bank runs.

Improve ELA, including by broadening collateral acceptance policies and
establishing a valuation framework with haircuts for non-standard collateral

Not implemented. Nevertheless, the CBK law allows the CBK to use any
collateral it deems acceptable for emergency lending. Currently, the ELA
comprises a wider range than government securities including traded shares
and bonds of solvent commercial companies as well as commercial paper, but
does not include other non-standard collateral.

Overhaul the bankruptcy framework to adequately handle bankruptcies of banks Not implemented.

ANNEX II. KUWAIT—RELATIONS WITH THE WORLD BANK GROUP
(As of June 7, 2011)
The World Bank and the Government of Kuwait developed a new four-year Country
Partnership Strategy (CPS) 2010–13, which leverages the setup of a World Bank Country Office
in Kuwait (inaugurated in January 2009).
The Kuwait CPS and program emphasize implementation of reforms. Hence all
programs are grounded in the Government five-year plan, and are developed closely with the
line ministry/agency as well as with the Ministry of Finance, which plays the coordinator role
and the Bank’s central counterpart.
The CPS focuses on Fee-Based Services laying the ground for Bank provision of
advisory and analytical support to Kuwait. Program priorities are driven and guided by CPS and
revolve around the following three pillars:
(i)
Improving public sector performance, with activities in the areas of reforming
procurement; improved governance including setting up an anti-corruption agency; fiscal
management, including support for Value Added Tax implementation; energy reforms in
renewable energy and increased efficiency; and support for several environmental initiatives.
(ii)
Economic diversification through increased private sector development, with
support for implementation of privatization law and public-private partnerships, and demand
for supporting development of small and medium enterprises.
(iii)
Human development, with a major program to support the quality of education,
including having an international expert based in Kuwait.
Ongoing Activities for the FY 2011–12
I – Improving public sector performance


Governance TA – Phase III. This is a third phase of a continuing Governance program
that began in FY08 (Phase I completed in FY09.) The scope of the project included
review and/or assistance in drafting legislation pertaining to conflict of interest, and asset
and income disclosure by public officials; advice and guidance on the creation of a wellfunctioning anticorruption agency including legal and institutional framework;
development of the agency’s strategic plan, operational manual and guidelines; and
public awareness campaign. The project is currently close to completion.

45


Clean Development Mechanism (CDM). At the request of the Environment Protection
Agency (EPA) the Bank is providing assistance in the development of a national CDM
Strategy, a CDM portfolio and an outline of options for Kuwait to participate in an
international post-Kyoto regime. This activity aims also at assisting the EPA raise
awareness and engage governmental and private sector stakeholders in a dialogue on
carbon finance in general and the CDM more specifically, as well as providing training
to potential project proponents and supporting identification of CDM project activities
and other emerging carbon trading schemes.



Environmental Compliance Fund (ECF). This activity is in response to the request
from the Kuwait Supreme Council for the Environment, and subsequently from the
Ministry of Finance, for World Bank support in promoting improved environmental
performance from point-source/industrial polluters in Kuwait through the establishment
of an ECF.



Power Sector Support. This activity aims at supporting the Ministry of Electricity and
Water (MEW) develop an implementation strategy, a coordination mechanism, and
implementation steps for the development of energy efficiency and large-scale solar
power combining the strengths of public and private sectors. This activity is drawing to a
conclusion and discussions are underway for a follow-up activity during which the Bank
will support MEW implement the detailed action plans and defined specific projects
recommended in phase one.



Project Cycle. At the request of the Ministry of Finance, the World Bank is conducting
a review of the government project cycle. The objective of this program is to explore
ways of shortening the project cycle and improving current project management
practices in Kuwait. The proposed evaluation will review and analyze a selection of
projects in government entities at three stages: concept, implementation and evaluation.
This review will identify bottlenecks and areas that need amendments in procedures or
regulation/legislation. It will also assist the Government to strengthen the capacity of the
Government agencies to implement projects through adequate training.



Value Added Tax (VAT). The World Bank is supporting efforts by the Kuwaiti
Government to design and implements a VAT - as part of Kuwait’s GCC union
obligations. Introducing VAT in Kuwait has four objectives: diversifying the sources of
public revenues; supporting economic development programs by making available a
steady stream of additional tax revenues; compensating the deficiency in customs duties
resulting from the application of free trade agreements; and, improving taxation on
luxury items. A parallel objective of this project is capacity building, which is where the
involvement of the World Bank is critical. This will be achieved through intensive
training in VAT basics, VAT specifics, VAT operations and modern techniques of tax
administration, as well as through on-the-job training by the experts hired by the project.

46
This focus on strengthening a critical public sector function – tax administration – in the
context of fiscal reform makes the Bank a natural partner for the government. An
international resident advisor will be placed in Kuwait for two years to work on this
activity.


Solid Waste Management II. This activity is a follow-up to a first phase solid Waste
Management program, which aimed at improving Kuwaiti authorities understanding of
the current challenges of the solid waste sector and incited them to promote reforms to
enhance cost effectiveness of private sector participation, particularly in collection,
sorting and recycling of waste. At the request of the Municipality of Kuwait City, the
Bank is engaged through this second phase of the program to help implement the main
recommendations of the first phase, namely: (i) preparation & implementation of a
national priority project for the closure and rehabilitation of existing dumpsites, (ii)
elaboration and adoption of a solid waste master plan consistent with Kuwait Land-Use
Master plan, to identify national policy & investment priorities for the solid waste sector,
(iii) completion & harmonization of existing legal instruments, starting with a Solid
Waste Law, and (iv) establishment of a municipal solid waste agency under the
municipality’s authority.



Kuwait Environmental Action Plan. This activity represents the Kuwaiti national
component of the regional initiative for the Gulf Environment Action Program (GEPAP)
launched in 2009 by the World Bank, at the meeting of the Gulf Cooperation Council
(GCC) Environment Coordination Committee in Muscat, Oman. The objective of this
activity is to support Kuwait’s efforts focus on environmental sustainability that could
generate financing and economic benefits in addition to protecting Kuwait’s natural
resources in line with the State’s regional and national priorities; and to help establish
clear, transparent and predictable environmental regulations that would improve the
investment climate in Kuwait. The activity comprises three main components, which are:
(i) Implementing a cost assessment of environmental degradation as a decision making
tool for delineating policy and investment priorities based on economic and social costs
of the various forms of environmental degradation; (ii) Carrying out a pollution load
assessment as a decision support system for monitoring and enforcement of
environmental regulations; and (iii) Strengthening the environmental impact assessment
system as a preventive tool for reducing environmental and social impacts and risks.



Follow-up to the Country Procurement Assessment Report (CPAR). Building on the
Bank’s CPAR report for Kuwait, the Bank is supporting the Ministry of Finance
procurement team draft a new comprehensive procurement law and to promote reforms
aimed at modernizing procurement practices in the country.

47
II – Economic diversification through increased private sector development


Public Authority for Transport. In this activity the World Bank is supporting the
Ministry of Commerce to establish a Public Authority for Transport (PAT) as decreed by
the Council of Ministers. In this task the Bank is commenting on draft laws establishing
the authority and providing options analysis for design, organization and governance of
the authority, including help with drawing the new authorities’ organizational structure
and Operations Manual. Discussions are underway with the MoC on possible additions
to the scope of work for the remainder of this program.



Public-Private Partnerships (PPP): Partnership Technical Bureau (PTB) Capacity
Building. The objective of this activity was to assist the PTB in the implementation of
the BOT (build-operate-transfer) Law 7, 2008. More specifically, the task team (i)
prepared operating BOT guidelines in line with the new Kuwait law and international
best practice; and (ii) assisted the PTB in becoming a fully operational body by
recommending a suitable organizational structure as well as provided ad hoc support in
preparing and finalizing documents, including: procurement documents for recruiting
transaction advisors, and requests for proposals. The first phase was completed in
March 2010, and currently the project team has begun implementation of the second
phase that will focus on the formal launch of the Kuwait PPP program (and the
dissemination of the PPP guidebook), including preparation of a PPP policy note, the
organization of a regional launch event; institutional and capacity development for PTB;
and assistance in establishing a project development fund.



Kuwait Airways Privatization Support. At the request of the Kuwait Investment
Authority the World Bank provided support in the evaluation of technical proposals for
the selection of a technical advisor to the Kuwait Airways Privatization Committee
(KAPC). As part of this task the Bank will also review and comment on draft
management and shareholder agreements.



Kuwait Foreign Investment Bureau (KFIB) Support. The World Bank is supporting
KFIB in developing feasibility studies and master plan(s) for three new economic zones
for foreign investors (Wafra, Abdali, and Shegaya).



Privatization Support. The Ministry of Finance asked for World Bank support in
implementing a recently passed Privatization Law. The Bank’s support will focus
initially on helping draft by-laws for the privatization law and policy (vision) statement
to provide additional rationale and explanation for the draft by-laws. The proposed
support also includes capacity building for the set-up of a Privatization Technical Bureau
(PTB); Portfolio development; Transaction support, Public education, and support
enhance corporate governance and Post-privatization reforms.

48


KPC Support. KPC management contacted the Bank, seeking support with KPC
privatization program. The World Bank is providing support to KPC in the following
three areas: (i) helping KPC establish a Private Sector Involvement Follow-Up unit; (ii)
Support to the preparation of an Options Guide for the private sector participation in
some of the KPC activities; and (iii) providing technical support for private sector
involvement in KPC activities through the establishment of a Petroleum Industrial Zone.

III – Human development


Education Sector TA. Building on the success of the School Education Quality
Improvement (SEQI) Program - designed to support the Ministry of Education (MoE) to
implement selected critical elements of its own 4-year Government Program, the World
Bank is partnering with MoE in expanding the cooperation program to improve the
output of the education process, including through work on curriculum, diversifying
secondary education (Grades 10-12) and developing an education system for special
needs and gifted students. The World Bank work in the education sector is further
expanding to potentially include support the work of the National Center for Assessment
and Evaluation (NCAE) as well as support for the development of a strong higher
education sector strategy, which will include a sector review and benchmarking to
regional and more global standards.

49
ANNEX III. KUWAIT—STATISTICAL ISSUES
(As of May 31, 2011)
I. Assessment of Data Adequacy for Surveillance
General: Data provision has some shortcomings, but is broadly adequate for surveillance.
There is scope for improved compilation of the national accounts and balance of payments
statistics through better coordination among statistical agencies. Timeliness, particularly for
the national accounts, is an area of concern.
National Accounts and Production: Recent improvements of national accounts include:
change of the base year for the constant price data to 2000 and the estimates of value added
for subsidized goods and services of the public utilities sector through the use of input costs
(the household expenditure survey was used previously). Continued progress, especially in
the estimation of value added for the oil sector, requires the dedication of adequate resources
and improved coordination between the Ministries of Planning, Oil, and Finance. The IMF’s
statistics department (STA) has provided technical assistance to the Ministry of Planning to
improve national accounts and price data. It would be useful if the Central Bank of Kuwait
(CBK) would publish oil sector information in the Quarterly Statistical Bulletin pertaining to
output, refining, domestic consumption, export price for crude and refined products and the
domestic price of petroleum products. These data are available from the Ministry of Oil.
Timeliness of the data needs to be improved. Recent delays in the production of price indexes
have caused long delays in the production of real GDP data.
Price statistics
CPI weights are based on the 1999–2000 household expenditure survey and were introduced
into the index for a reference year of 2002. An improved monthly CPI based on a revised
basket has been published in monthly CPI bulletins with about a one-month lag. The
wholesale price index (WPI) needs to be developed into a producer price index (PPI) which
is consistent with the national accounts and includes all domestically produced goods,
ex-factory, for the export and the domestic market.
Government finance statistics: Annual GFS data are reported for publication in the
Government Finance Statistics Yearbook (GFSY). The major components of extrabudgetary
revenues (investment income and transfers of profits of public institutions), extrabudgetary
expenditures (interest on foreign debt and treasury paper), and financing operations
conducted by two reserve funds are not reported. Data on investment income, and on interest
on foreign debt and treasury paper, however, are usually provided to Article IV consultation
missions.
The authorities have made some progress in fiscal data presentation, but the lack of a suitable
classification of data on the execution of the budget remains a constraint on monitoring

50
effectively fiscal developments during the year. The authorities’ presentation is not yet fully
compliant with the GFSM 2001 guidance, but progress is being made in terms of creating a
new chart of accounts and moving reporting to an accrual basis.
Data on the operations of the Public Institute for Social Security are not made available.
Sharing of information between various government agencies could be improved. STA has
indicated to the authorities that operations of the two reserve funds should be classified as
part of government, as they perform activities for public policy purposes (management of
debt and assets, and financing of the budget). An additional extension of coverage would be
to report GFS in the form of the Statement of Sources and Uses of Cash for the consolidated
central government. The authorities have also been briefed on the IMF’s ongoing work to
enhance the transparency of fiscal accounts and presentations detailed in the “Code of Good
Practices on Fiscal Transparency” and were encouraged to adopt some of the practices
recommended in the Code.
Monetary and financial statistics
The CBK reports monetary data to STA on a regular and timely basis based on the
Standardized Report Forms (SRFs). CBK needs to work further to distinguish a number of
investment companies that accept deposits from other investment companies that do not
accept deposits. Investment companies that accept deposits should appropriately be classified
as part of the depository corporations sector. In the current SRFs, all investment companies
(including those that accept deposits) are classified as other financial corporations. However,
the amount of deposits accepted by investment companies is considered as not significant.
Balance of Payments Statistics: The CBK compiles and disseminates detailed annual data
in accordance with the methodology of the BPM5, while trade data estimates are
disseminated monthly. However, data on capital flows of the nonfinancial private sector are
limited. To improve coverage for inward foreign direct investment, the CBK is making
efforts to obtain more data by surveying direct investment enterprises. The Central Statistical
Office (CSO), working with the CBK, plans to implement the IMF’s Coordinated Direct
Investment Survey in 2010–11. This initiative should improve foreign direct investment
statistics. Enhancements have been made in the estimation of travel services and
communication services, but further improvements are needed in compilation practices and
in the estimation of data on several service items and private transfers.
A major step forward in 2007 was the dissemination of IIP data for 2001 onwards in STA
publications. However, the information on IIP data made available to staff is incomplete as it
excludes the external assets held by the general government due to domestic legal constraints
on dissemination (however, loans granted by the Kuwaiti Fund for Arab Economic
Development and general government trade credits are included).

51
The CBK also participates in the Coordinated Portfolio Investment Survey (CPIS) with data
reported for 2003 onwards. These data are for the financial sector acting as end-investors or
as intermediaries on behalf of residents and do not include holdings of foreign securities held
by government agencies, which comprise the bulk of Kuwait’s cross-border holdings.
In 2009, STA provided TA on improving external accounts data. The CBK has made good
progress since then, particularly in the substantial revisions to report forms, including the
separate reporting of financial transactions in the BOP and other changes in volume in the
international investment position. It has also made progress in the estimation of remittances
data. Yet, major delays and data gaps remain. In particular, major government entities do not
report quarterly data to the CBK in time to compile timely quarterly statistics. Trade data are
compiled by the CSO annually and provided to the CBK with a time lag of well over one
year. Furthermore, the response rate for the private nonfinancial sector is low.
II. Data Standards and Quality
Kuwait is one of the first GDDS participants. No data ROSC is available.
However, most of its metadata, with the
exception of the real sector and sociodemographic metadata, have not been updated
since October 2002. The CBK maintains its
own webpage where it provides the following
data to the public: money and banking
statistics; balance of payments statistics; trade
balance statistics; exchange rate; GDP by
sector and expenditure at current and constant
prices; public finance statistics; CPI and WPI;
and security market indicators. Similarly, the
Ministry of Planning has a webpage where the
CSO publishes data on national accounts,
prices, and other related statistics. The
Ministry of Finance webpage includes
detailed data for actual and estimated budget
operations. In addition, the Kuwait Stock
Exchange webpage provides data on stock
market indices, volume and value of securities
traded, as well as privatization schedules and
other related information.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
July 19, 2011

International Monetary Fund
700 19th Street, NW
Washington, D. C. 20431 USA

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2011 Article IV Consultation with Kuwait
On July 15, 2011, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded the
Article IV consultation with Kuwait.1
Background
The 2011 consultation discussions were held against the backdrop of the second year of
implementation of Kuwait’s Development Plan, recovery in non-oil economic activity, tension
between government and parliament, regional unrest, and higher global oil prices.
Real Gross Domestic Product (GDP) growth in 2010 is estimated at 3.3 percent, comprising oil
growth of 3.2 percent and non-oil growth of 3.4 percent. Activity has been driven mostly by an
expansionary fiscal stance. Government Expenditure in FY2010/11—excluding energyrelated subsidies and recapitalization of social security—is estimated to have increased by
21½ percent. Half of this growth was attributed to the recent Amiri grant, which included a cash
transfer of about $3,600 to each Kuwaiti citizen (equivalent to almost 3 percent of 2010 GDP)
and free essential food items from February 2011 through March 2012. The increase in bank
lending to the private sector was small, with higher lending of 3.3 percent to the productive
sectors (industry, services, and trade) partially offset by a reduction in credit to the real estate
and financial sectors.
1

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On
return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the
Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the
Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the
country's authorities. An explanation of any qualifiers used in summings up can be found here:
http://www.imf.org/external/np/sec/misc/qualifiers.htm.

2
Headline inflation increased in 2010, primarily due to higher international food prices. Average
food inflation reached about 8.2 percent in 2010 (and 9.8 percent at end-April 2011), compared
to 3.4 percent in 2009, but its impact on Kuwaiti citizens has been mitigated by the Amiri grant.
Non-food inflation remains subdued at around 3.6 percent as of April 2011, reflecting moderate
increases in rents. Similar to other countries in the region, the regional unrest has weighed
down on stock market prices, which declined by over 8 percent in 2011 through May 25. At the
same time, Kuwait has increased its oil production to assist in the effort to stabilize the global oil
market.
Banks’ profitability and capitalization have improved but the Investment Companies (ICs) sector
continued to post losses. Profits of local banks increased by 70 percent in 2010 and the sector’s
capital adequacy ratio increased to 19 percent in 2010 from 17 percent in 2009. ICs continued
to struggle and posted losses on average in 2010—although at a lower level than average
losses in 2009—and the debt restructuring of some ICs remains unresolved. The performance
of the nonfinancial corporate sector has improved in 2010, notwithstanding the continued drag
by the real estate sector.
Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors noted that Kuwait’s economy has recovered from the impact of the global
financial crisis on the back of a strong fiscal stimulus and an ambitious development plan. The
outlook is however subject to external and internal risks and policy will need to be implemented
flexibly in the period ahead. To secure sustainable broad-based growth and address the
challenges ahead, Directors also stressed the need for further fiscal, financial, and institutional
reforms.
Directors endorsed the currently accommodative mix of macroeconomic policies, but
recommended that support be withdrawn if signs of overheating emerge. They agreed that the
basket peg regime remains broadly appropriate and took note of the staff’s assessment that the
exchange rate is broadly in line with medium-term fundamentals.
Directors considered that the authorities’ 2010—2014 Development Plan rightly targets much
needed investment, including in human capital, with a view to better preparing Kuwaiti nationals
for private sector employment. They underscored the importance of implementing this plan
carefully, with special regard to project viability, the business environment, and absorptive
capacity, while avoiding the buildup of vulnerabilities in private sector’s balance sheets.
More broadly, Directors emphasized the importance of further reforms to improve the fiscal
framework, reduce distortions, and ensure intergenerational equity in the sharing of oil wealth.
Priority should be given to tax reforms, including the introduction of a value-added tax and a
comprehensive income tax system, better targeted subsidies and social benefits, and a
reallocation of public expenditure toward investment. A fiscal rule could also strengthen fiscal
management.

3
Directors recognized important advances in financial sector stability. They welcomed
improvements in banks profits and balance sheets and progress in implementing the
recommendations of the 2010 Financial Sector Assessment Program. Directors cautioned,
however, that many investment companies remained in fragile financial positions and urged the
authorities to monitor their situation closely. In this regard, developing of a special resolution
regime for financial institutions would facilitate efficient restructuring and exits. The
effectiveness of financial oversight would also be boosted by further empowering the newly
established Capital Market Authority and the adoption of a new AML/CFT law.
Directors welcomed improvements in Kuwait’s statistical system but considered that more work
is needed. They encouraged the authorities to provide additional support to the Central
Statistical Office and give priority to the compilation of timely national accounts.

Statement by Mr. Shaalan on Kuwait
Executive Board Meeting
July 15, 2011
1.
On behalf of the Kuwaiti authorities, I would like to thank staff for the constructive
dialogue and candid advice during the article IV discussions. The authorities broadly concur
with staff’s analysis and recommendations. The discussions rightly focused on the planned
fiscal and financial reforms, as well as on the agenda to achieve sustainable growth and
economic diversification.
Recent developments
2.
After contracting by 5 percent in 2009, economic activity recovered to about
3 percent in 2010, underpinned by a supportive fiscal stance and reflecting a rebound in both
the oil and non-oil sectors. Headline inflation increased on account of higher international
food prices. Non-food prices, however, remained subdued.
3.
The fiscal and external accounts continued to post large surpluses, reflecting high
international oil prices. The fiscal surplus is estimated at 21 percent of GDP in 2010,
notwithstanding an increase in government expenditure by 21½ percent of GDP.
4.
Financial soundness indicators point to a considerable improvement in banking
system strength and resilience. Capital adequacy ratio remained significantly above the
minimum required by the Central Bank of Kuwait (CBK). Bank profitability increased and
non-performing loans dropped due to write-offs of fully provisioned loans. Credit to
residents, however, recorded modest growth in 2010, as a result of stricter regulations
following the financial crisis and the cautious lending policies adopted since last year.
An ambitious development plan
5.
In February 2010, Kuwait’s parliament approved a US$ 108 billion development plan
extending over 4 years. This plan is the first of six successive plans that are aimed at
rendering Kuwait a regional financial and trade hub by 2035. The plan will help restructure
the economy by promoting diversification away from the oil sector and paving the way for
greater private sector participation in economic activity. Half of the investments envisaged in
the plan will come from the private sector and three quarters of investments will benefit the
non-oil sector. The plan also envisages the enactment or revision of laws that are intended to
enhance the role of the private sector.
Economic outlook and risks
6.
Growth momentum is likely to be sustained in 2011 and beyond, on the account of
the newly approved development plan. While there may be concerns regarding the
government’s capacity to execute the development plan in a timely manner, the restoration of
confidence in the prospects of the economy is likely to have a positive impact on the non-oil
sector. The increase in oil prices in 2011 will provide an added incentive for the government

2
to move ahead with the large projects and more generally, expedite the pace of project
execution. However, price pressures are expected to pick up in 2011, although this mainly
reflects an increase in international food prices.
Towards sustainable economic growth
7.
Kuwait’s economy and public finances remain very reliant on the oil sector, which
accounts for more than 90 percent of budget revenues and exports. The new development
plan aims at building a more diverse and dynamic economy, by providing incentives for the
private sector to assume a leading role in the economy. This will also reduce pressures on the
government to continue providing job opportunities for Kuwaiti nationals.
8.
The business environment in Kuwait will largely benefit from the investments
identified in the development plan. The plan incorporates an upgrade of the country’s
infrastructure, including roads, airports, and hospitals. It also calls for sizable investments in
education in order to prepare Kuwaiti nationals for employment in the private sector.
9.
The development plan took off slowly in its first year due to delays in introducing the
needed legislative base. This new legislation aims at improving efficiency, governance, and
competitiveness.
Fiscal policy reforms
10.
The strong recovery in oil prices will enable Kuwait to sustain continued spending
over the medium term while still achieving a significant surplus. Staff’s analysis points to a
high government expenditure multiplier. The authorities are in agreement with this finding.
They concur with staff on the importance of better targeting spending, and particularly
subsidies. Currently, work is ongoing to improve collection and proposing a new pricing
mechanism for public utilities. A significant portion of government spending is also directed
towards the recapitalization of the social security fund.
11.
On the revenue side, and in order to enhance non-oil revenue, the authorities will
introduce tax reforms in the medium term. They intend to introduce a VAT as well as an
income tax. Progress has also been achieved in establishing a macro-fiscal unit at the
Ministry of Finance.
Monetary policy and financial sector issues
12.
Monetary policy has been accommodative since the onset of the global financial
crisis. Below potential growth in the non-oil GDP, import-driven inflationary pressures, and
low global interest rates; all justify an accommodative stance. Nonetheless, the CBK remains
vigilant to the developments of liquidity in the banking system, and stands ready to tighten its
monetary stance when market conditions signal overheating.
13.
The pegged exchange rate regime continues to serve the Kuwaiti economy well.
Although the U.S. dollar plays a dominant role in the basket, the exchange rate regime gives

3
the CBK a degree of flexibility in relation to the U.S. economy, in view of the differences in
the business cycles of the two countries. The CBK has a set of policy instruments, such as
loan-to-deposit ratio and credit growth limits, to resort to if needed.
14.
The banking system remains well supervised and highly capitalized. Banks’
profitability is expected to rise with the healthy growth in the economy and the financing
opportunities that will be created by the development plan. Stress tests carried out by CBK
and by staff indicate a strong resiliency of banks to severe shocks. The adequate provisioning
against loans to investment companies (IC) will mitigate the impact of IC risks on banks
profitability. The CBK has issued new regulations in June 2010 imposing a number of
prudential limits on IC liquidity, leverage, and foreign exposure. In addition, IC must meet
the quantitative regulations of the CBK by 2012 to ensure that IC are undertaking a proper
restructuring. The CBK continues to monitor progress in this area.
Other issues
15.
Kuwait is committed to continue its support to developing countries, especially
through the HIPC Initiative. More recently, Kuwait pledged to support the Managing Natural
Resources Wealth topical fund and the Tax Policy and Administration topical fund.
