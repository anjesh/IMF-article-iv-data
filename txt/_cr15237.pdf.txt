IMF Executive Board Concludes 2015 Article IV Consultation with Panama
On June 10, 2015, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded the
Article IV consultation1 with Panama.
Panama’s economic performance is expected to remain strong. Real GDP slowed to 6.2 percent
in 2014, reflecting a slower pace of public investment, continued weakness in Colon Free Zone
activity, and delays in the Canal expansion. Growth is expected to remain stable in 2015. Lower
oil prices and the U.S. recovery will be positive forces but these will be offset by U.S. dollar
appreciation and some lags in new public investment. Over the medium term, the expanded
Canal and the new copper mine should help maintain growth at 6-7 percent. Inflation moderated
to 2.6 percent in 2014 as a result of lower oil prices and price controls on certain food items.
Inflation is expected at around 1 percent in 2015, taking into consideration the January increase
in electricity tariffs, and assuming a slow upward trajectory for oil prices and the elimination of
price controls in July.
The 2014 fiscal deficit reached 4.3 percent of 1996-base GDP. Revenues increased by
1.1 percent while current primary expenditures grew by 13 percent. Going forward, the fiscal
framework envisaged in the Social and Fiscal Responsibility Law (SFRL) aims at removing the
effects on government spending of cyclical fluctuations in Canal contributions. Accordingly, the
overall fiscal deficit can exceed the SFRL deficit ceilings up to the amount that budget
contributions from the Canal are below 3.5 percent of GDP (if above, the difference would
instead be credited to the Sovereign Wealth Fund). In line with the framework, the 2015 fiscal
deficit is expected at 3.8 percent of 1996-base GDP in order to accommodate past commitments
on capital expenditures as well as a projected weak revenue performance. Total gross debt of the
public sector (including the Canal Authority debt) increased to about 46 percent of GDP in 2014,
reversing the declining trend seen since 2005. Nonetheless, public debt is projected as
sustainable. Under the planned policies, total gross public debt is projected to decline by about
5 percentage points of GDP by 2019. However, additional liabilities encompass unfunded

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with members, usually
every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial information, and discusses with officials
the country's economic developments and policies. On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which
forms the basis for discussion by the Executive Board.

pension liabilities, other outstanding public liabilities, and the contingent liabilities linked to
public companies.
The current account deficit remained elevated in 2014, at 12 percent of GDP, owing in part to
strong investment-related imports, but should moderate over time as investment projects wind
down and exports increase. This deficit is expected to continue to be financed by buoyant foreign
direct investment inflows (including in the mining, logistics and energy sectors).
The authorities and the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) agreed on a plan to address the
deficiencies related to Panama’s Anti-Money Laundering and Combating the Financing of
Terrorism (AML/CFT) framework, to bring the framework in line with the international
standard. The authorities have made substantial progress, including the passing of new
AML/CFT legislation.
Near-term risks mostly relate to a weaker global economy or to possible delays in enhancing
financial transparency. Slower-than-expected global growth and weaker trade represent
downside risks. An abrupt surge in global financial market volatility or an upward shift in U.S.
interest rates would feed quickly into the local financial system, with spillover effects on the
local economy. However, strong fundamentals and the room to implement a countercyclical
fiscal response would mitigate the impact of such external shocks. The potential negative impact
from delays in concluding the measures to tackle financial transparency shortcomings could be
significant. Conducting international transactions has become somewhat more difficult due to
concerns over transparency and weaknesses of the AML/CFT framework, including through
increased due diligence by correspondent banks. Delaying reforms to financial integrity and
transparency could have negative implications for the economy through higher costs of trade
settlements, difficulty in obtaining cross-border borrowing and potential decline in FDIs.
Executive Board Assessment2
Executive Directors commended Panama’s robust macroeconomic performance and continued
solid economic growth. Noting Panama’s exposure to external shocks in global growth, trade,
and financial markets, Directors stressed the importance of enhancing the fiscal framework and
fostering resilience through strengthened fiscal buffers, while maintaining financial stability and
sustaining strong and inclusive growth.
Directors encouraged the authorities to strengthen the fiscal framework for the medium term.
They advised revising the threshold for canal contributions in line with average expected
contributions, while adopting a more comprehensive definition of net debt in the Social and
Fiscal Responsibility Law (SFRL). Directors also recommended continued efforts to enhance
revenue mobilization through capacity building and administrative reforms. They welcomed the

progress in reducing electricity subsidies, and encouraged further efforts to improve the targeting
of subsidies and streamline current spending.
Directors underscored the importance of reforming the pension system to address large unfunded
liabilities, while curbing other contingent liabilities. They looked forward to full implementation
of the Single Treasury Account and progress on other initiatives to improve public financial
management.
Directors commended the authorities for the progress in enhancing the financial integrity and
transparency frameworks, including the recent passage of AML/CFT legislation and ongoing
implementation of the action plan agreed with the Financial Action Task Force (FATF). They
called for expeditious resolution of the remaining deficiencies to bring the financial integrity and
transparency frameworks fully in line with the international standard.
Directors noted that Panama’s banking system remains stable, well capitalized and highly liquid,
but advised continued efforts to strengthen bank supervision and risk monitoring. They
encouraged swift implementation of the remaining 2011 FSAP recommendations, and called for
further progress on a well-designed liquidity facility for banks. Directors also recommended
better monitoring of financial risks and macrofinancial linkages, and further development of the
macroprudential policy framework.
Directors agreed that improvements in productivity and human capital are key to sustainable,
equitable, and inclusive growth. This will require efforts to further enhance the quality of public
education and healthcare, upgrade skills, stimulate youth employment and female labor force
participation, and strengthen institutions. They also recommended that the authorities take
advantage of the current benign inflation environment to phase out price controls.
Directors encouraged the authorities to improve the quality and coverage of statistics, which
would help close gaps in data that are relevant for conducting sound macroeconomic policy and
risk assessment.

STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2015 ARTICLE IV CONSULTATION

KEY ISSUES
Backdrop and Outlook. Panama’s economic growth is slowing towards its mediumterm potential and is expected to remain in the 6–7 percent range over the next 5 years.
Inflation has been declining due to lower oil prices and price controls imposed on some
food items in July 2014. The external current account deficit remains elevated, with
foreign direct investment as the main source of financing, but should moderate over
time as investment winds down and the corresponding projects start generating exports.
Risks. A globally integrated economy brings substantial benefits to Panama, but also
makes it vulnerable to external shocks to global growth, trade, and financial markets.
However, strong fundamentals and the room to implement a countercyclical fiscal
response would mitigate the impact of such external shocks. Delayed reforms to
financial transparency are an important risk that could restrict access to global capital
and the international payments system.
Policy advice. It is essential to finalize the strengthening of the Anti-Money Laundering
and Combating the Financing of Terrorism (AML/CFT) framework in order to comply
with the international standard. The fiscal framework needs to be strengthened to serve
as a solid medium-term anchor. In particular, fiscal buffers should be enhanced to cope
with risks and expected or potential liabilities. In parallel, the pension system needs to be
reformed, notably to address the large unfunded pension liabilities. Financial sector
reforms should be geared towards implementing fully the remaining recommendations
of the 2011 Financial Sector Assessment Program (FSAP), including establishing a facility
for the provision of temporary liquidity to banks, improving the monitoring of external
and systemic risks, upgrading the legislation on non-bank financial intermediaries, and
developing further the macroprudential policy framework along with key instruments.
Further investment in training, education, and healthcare will raise labor productivity and
promote sustained and more inclusive growth.

Panama’s economic growth continues to
slow towards its medium-term potential. Real
GDP growth slowed down to 6.2 percent after
reaching 8.4 percent in 2013 (Table 1)1. This mainly
reflects a slowing in the pace of public investment
from the high levels of recent years, continued
weakness in Colon Free Zone activity (in part linked to
difficulties in trade relations with Venezuela and
Colombia), and delays in the Canal expansion.
Unemployment has risen modestly, reflecting the
economic slowdown, but still remains low by historical
standards.

July 2014, initially for 6 months, and subsequently until June 2015. As a result of these price controls,
coupled with lower oil prices, headline inflation decelerated from 3.4 percent (yoy) in June 2014 to
-0.4 percent in February 2015. The government has taken advantage of lower oil prices to reduce
energy subsidies. Inflation is projected at around 1 percent in 2015, taking into consideration the
January increase in electricity tariffs, a slow upward trajectory for oil prices, and the elimination of
price controls in July.

ceilings (that apply to the adjusted fiscal deficit)
insofar as contributions from the Canal to the budget are below 3.5 percent of GDP. (If above
3.5 percent of GDP, the difference would instead be credited to the FAP.) In line with this feature of
the fiscal framework, the 2015 overall fiscal deficit is budgeted at 3.7 percent of 2007-base GDP, in
order to accommodate past commitments on capital expenditures as well as a projected weak
revenue performance. In the coming years, Canal contributions are likely to continue to fall short of
the 3.5 percent of GDP threshold and, as a result, the overall fiscal deficit is expected to exceed the
SFRL ceilings (that apply to the adjusted fiscal deficit) by 1–2 percent of GDP per year.
7.
Public debt to GDP increased in 2014 but, even with the higher deficit path, will start
to move onto a declining path. Total public sector gross debt (including Canal-related debt)
increased to about 46 percent of 1996-base GDP in 2014, reversing the declining trend seen

since 2005. Nonetheless, public debt is viewed as sustainable (Annex V) and, under the planned
policies outlined in the authorities’ five-year
strategic plan (see below), total public sector gross
debt is expected to decline by about 5 percentage
points of GDP by 2019. However, the broad set of
potential public liabilities is larger, encompassing
the unfunded pension liabilities (estimated at about
US$10.7 billion or 24 percent of 2014 GDP, see
Box 1), pending government obligations associated
with turnkey projects (currently about US$3 billion)
or the contingent liabilities linked to public
companies (about US$ 4 billion). In September 2014
and March 2015 Panama issued two ten-year bonds, each for US$1.25 billion. Both issuances
included strengthened pari passu clauses that expressly exclude the obligation to effect ratable
payments, in line with IMF recommendations. The March 2015 bond (which further includes an
enhanced collective action clause) priced at a spread of 178 basis points—very low by historical
standards—above the ten-year U.S. Treasury bonds, with an effective interest rate of 3.89 percent.
8.
The authorities released a five-year strategic plan in January. The plan was focused on
social, economic, fiscal, and financial issues, and was designed in consultation with the private
sector, within the fiscal constraints of the existing SFRL. Its goals are to catalyze investment and
support growth in key sectors (logistic, agriculture, tourism, and mining), and promote socioeconomic developments (in part by enhancing the education system, social programs, infrastructure,
and labor markets).

effect on bilateral trade is expected to be substantial over time.

The main pension program was reformed in 2005. The
disability, old age and death benefits (Invalidez, Vejez y
Muerte, IVM) accounts for more than one half of the CSS
revenues and expenditures. Before the reform in 2005, the
IVM was entirely a defined benefit system and overly
generous. As the IVM faced both actuarial and cash deficit,
the eligibility requirements were tightened and contribution
rate was raised. However, the reform was incomplete due to
strong public oppositions, and only postponed the actuarial
imbalance of the defined benefit portion of the system.

The IVM after the 2005 reform includes two subsystems: the subsystem of exclusively defined benefit (old system) and
the subsystem of mixed defined benefit and defined contribution (new system). Affiliation to the CSS is mandatory for most

The unfunded pension liabilities in the exclusively defined benefit system are estimated at almost US$11 billion.
Actuarial studies indicate that the exclusively defined benefit subsystem will incur losses in cash terms from 2016 onward
and reserves will be depleted in 2024. The projected actuarial deficit by 2032 amounts to US$6½bn in NPV terms. No
actuarial study covering the period beyond 2032 has been conducted. However, since the last associate is currently expected
to retire in 2048, the CSS estimates that the NPV of all future liabilities of this system could amount to US$10.7 billion in
NPV terms. To the extent that the defined benefit component of the new system has similar features, it is also expected to
eventually become unsustainable.
Urgent reforms are required to ensure the financial sustainability of the system. Even after the 2005 reform, the IVM
program remains generous by international standards, more than in most Latin American and several West European
countries. Raising retirement ages, and unifying female and male retirement age, would not only enhance CSS sustainability
but also have a positive impact on labor supply and GDP1 (measures would need to be taken to protect the income of those
that cannot continue to work). Further reduction in replacement rates could also be considered.
1. By equalizing retirement age for women and men at 62, the number of active contributors to the exclusively defined benefit system could
increase by about 22,700, or 1.3 percent of the labor force based on current demographic structure.

Banking sector conditions remain supportive of growth but some signs of exuberance
are visible. Overall credit to the private sector grew in line with nominal GDP in 2014 (remaining at
about 90 percent of GDP) and is expected to continue to do so in the medium term. Construction
credit has slowed, converging to the lower growth rate of mortgage and consumer credit (see
Figure 3). However, due to the difficulties in the Colon Free Zone (ZLC), growth in credit to
commerce stalled in 2014. Panama’s credit and funding risks have declined and the banking system
remains sound. Bank performance indicators are sound with low credit risk, significant balance sheet
buffers, and robust asset quality (see Box 2 and Table 5). At the same time, mortgage delinquencies
are somewhat elevated (at about 4 percent in December 2014), and there is anecdotal evidence of
overcapacity in commercial real estate (although data on the property sector is poor).
11.
The authorities are working to strengthen the Anti-Money Laundering and Combating
the Financing of Terrorism (AML/CFT) framework. A 2012 assessment by Fund staff highlighted
significant shortcomings in Panama’s AML/CFT framework. Subsequently, the Financial Action Task
Force (FATF) publicly identified Panama among countries which have strategic AML/CFT deficiencies.
The authorities and the FATF agreed on a plan to address these deficiencies and to bring the
framework in line with the international standard by mid-2015. The plan includes strengthening laws
and regulations, implementing measures to freeze terrorist assets, improving customer due
diligence (CDD) practices, strengthening the Financial Intelligence Unit (UAF), expanding suspicious
reporting to all financial institutions and Designated Non-Financial Businesses and Professions
(DNFBPs), and improving international cooperation. In February, the FATF recognized Panama’s
progress in the areas of issuing guidance about suspicious reporting, improving the UAF’s capacity,
and issuing regulations on bearer shares, but noted that Panama needs to complete its plan to
address all the identified deficiencies.

RISKS TO THE OUTLOOK
12.
Near-term risks mostly relate to the global outlook. With around 5 percent of world
trade passing through the Panama Canal and a very globalized financial system, the country is
highly exposed to external shocks. Slower-than-expected global growth or weaker trade represents
a key downside risk. An abrupt surge in global financial market volatility or an upward shift in global
interest rates would feed quickly into the local financial system. However, strong fundamentals and
the room to implement a countercyclical fiscal response would mitigate the impact of such external
shocks.
13.
Perhaps more serious is the potential negative impact from inadequately tackling
financial transparency shortcomings. Conducting international transactions has become
somewhat more difficult due to concerns over transparency and weaknesses of the AML/CFT
framework, including through increased due diligence by correspondent banks. Delaying reforms to
financial integrity and transparency could have negative implications for the economy through
higher costs of trade settlements, difficulty in obtaining cross-border borrowing, and potential
decline in FDI.

Box 2. Panama’s Financial Sector Remains Sound
Credit, funding, and spillover risks for Panama have
declined. Lower credit risks result mainly from the recent
deceleration in credit growth. Market and liquidity risks
have declined as the banks have become less reliant on
nonresident deposits and foreign liabilities to fund their
domestic credit. Inward spillover risks have waned as the
economy has become less trade dependent.
Macroeconomic risks to the financial system are low,
but have been shifting. The higher budget deficit and
lower investment growth have been more pronounced
in 2014 than in the past few years, but these are currently
offset by lower spreads, open access to international
markets, and low unemployment. Largely reflecting global
forces, financial conditions in Panama and investors’
appetite for Panamanian assets have been broadly
unchanged over the past year.
Panama’s financial system displays low vulnerability. The
Financial Soundness Indicators heatmap provides a snapshot
of banking sector vulnerabilities, suggesting a low credit
cycle risk, good loan-to-deposit ratio, adequate balance
sheet buffers, good asset quality, and very low NPL ratio
despite recent increases. However, anecdotal evidence
points to possible overcapacity in commercial real estate.

POLICY ISSUES
The most immediate priority is to finalize the process of enhancing financial integrity. There is also a
need to strengthen the medium-term fiscal framework and build fiscal buffers. Monitoring, supervision,
and regulation of the financial sector should continue being enhanced. Ensuring a smooth transition to
a robust and inclusive medium-term growth path will require efforts to boost productivity and
competitiveness.

A. Strengthening Financial Integrity
14.
It is essential to finalize the action plan Panama agreed with the FATF (see the Risk
Assessment Matrix in Annex II). Since the FATF identified Panama as having strategic AML/CFT
deficiencies, many countries have instructed their financial institutions to scrutinize transactions
linked to Panama. According to the authorities and private sector, maintaining correspondent
relationships with foreign banks and conducting international trade and banking transactions has
become more challenging, although with modest overall impact so far. The authorities are
continuing to work on the action plan agreed with the FATF and have adopted legislative
amendments aimed at expanding the list of predicate offenses to money laundering (ML), dealing
with the freezing of terrorist assets, and strengthening preventative AML/CFT controls (particularly
related to beneficial ownership).
15.
Staff commended the authorities for their significant efforts. In particular, the passing of
a new anti-money laundering law in April 2015 is an important step. Now, Panama needs to quickly
implement the rest of the action plan so as to avoid FATF calling for greater scrutiny of transactions
linked to Panama. In particular, regulations implementing the legislative changes need to be
finalized in a timely fashion. The authorities reiterated their strong commitment, and indicated
that—while there may be short-term costs associated with complying with international
transparency requirements (FATF action plan)—the long–term (net) benefits of having a financial
sector grounded in transparency are significant.

B. Strengthening the Fiscal Framework and Building Fiscal Buffers
16.
The fiscal framework needs to be
revamped. Over the past 5 years, the deficit ceilings
in the original SFRL have been repeatedly changed
through amendments to the law. Under the current
fiscal framework, the threshold for the Canal
contribution to the budget is too high compared with
current projections, thus allowing for overall fiscal
deficits larger than the SFRL ceilings applicable to the
adjusted deficit over the medium term. Based on
current projections, the overall fiscal deficit is
expected to

exceed the adjusted overall fiscal deficit by a cumulative 6 percent of GDP over the next five years.
Meanwhile, no resources are expected to be transferred to the Sovereign Wealth Fund in the
foreseeable future.
17.
Strengthening the fiscal framework is a priority. To ensure fiscal discipline and enhance
the role of the medium-term fiscal framework as an anchor, staff urged the authorities to refrain
from changing the SFRL ceilings and to review the fiscal framework taking into consideration

argue for larger fiscal buffers (especially in
light of the absence of monetary policy). The net debt definition could be broadened to include, for
example, other outstanding public liabilities (such as obligations associated with turnkey projects)
and liquid public financial assets. It would also be important for any congressional approval of a
deficit that temporarily exceeds the medium-term path to be accompanied by compensatory
adjustments in future years. Automatic remedial actions (e.g. to limit future spending in the years
following a deficit overrun) could also be considered. Finally, to ensure the effectiveness of the

18.
Policy efforts should be bolstered to raise tax revenues and streamline current
expenditures. An increase in revenues could be achieved by strengthening tax collection and
reviewing tax policy. The newly established Dirección General de Ingresos (DGI) should continue its
efforts to expand capacity and enhance efficiency. Addressing the unfunded pension liabilities will
require not only public funding, but also reforming the pension system (for example by raising and
unifying the retirement age, and by closing the gap between contributions and payouts). The
planned revision of the electricity subsidies is a positive step and is in line with the authorities’
broader objective of aligning tariffs with costs through the existing automatic adjustment framework
(while planned investments are expected to reduce inefficiencies in the energy sector, see Box 3).
More broadly, the targeting of other subsidies should be improved.
19.
In addition, meeting the authorities’ fiscal deficit limits presented in the five-year
strategic plan may require fiscal adjustments. Staff’s nominal GDP projection (with 2007 as the
base year) for 2015 is 5 percent lower than the one in the five-year strategic plan, which implies that
meeting the authorities’ deficit limit of 3.7 percent of GDP for 2015 is likely to require an adjustment
of 0.2 percent of GDP from the Budget. Additional adjustments (totaling about 0.4 percent of GDP)
would be necessary to keep the 2019 Non Financial Public Sector (NFPS) debt (i.e. excluding the
Canal-related debt) below the authorities’ implicit target of 35 percent of GDP.
20.
The authorities shared staff concerns. They agree that regularly changing deficit ceilings
undermine credibility. They furthermore mentioned that the fiscal framework envisaged in Law 38 of
2012 was created at a time when Canal contributions were projected to be much higher as a share
of GDP than currently envisaged. As such a framework is helpful for expenditure smoothing and for
counter cyclical purposes, the authorities were inclined to amend the law rather than either
eliminate it or replace it with an alternative framework. They are considering asking for technical
assistance on the fiscal framework. They are committed to empowering the DGI as well as lowering
subsidies and enhancing the associated targeting. The authorities unified the taxation rate on
alcoholic content, with an expected tax revenue increase of $38 million, and plan to reduce special
tax advantages and close loopholes, such as those on preferred shares. This would help fund the
increase in nominal pension payments (which are not indexed to inflation) planned for this year. The
authorities are aware of the optimism embedded in the GDP projections, and are committed to
maintaining both the deficit within the limits announced in the five-year plan and the 2019 NFPS
debt below 35 percent of GDP. The adjustment is likely to fall on capital expenditure in 2015 and on
both capital and current expenditure in subsequent years.
21.
The authorities are also committed to continue strengthening public financial
management tools. The government just launched a new platform for centralized management of
financial information (Integración y Soluciones Tecnológicas del Modelo de Gestión Operativa,
ISTMO), which would enhance transparency and efficiency, as well as help cap budgetary allocations.
The new system should encompass twenty-four central government agencies by end-2015, and the
decentralized institutions by end-2016. Regulation related to the Single Treasury Account was
approved in the fall of 2014 and the implementation is starting. By end-2015 the accounts of the
central government agencies that participate in the first phase of ISTMO (representing about two
thirds of total funds in those accounts) should be unified in the single account, while the accounts of
other agencies should be included in the subsequent two years.

Box 3. Panama’s Electricity Subsidies
Electricity tariffs in Panama are subsidized, and about three-quarters of the subsidies are not
targeted. Panama has two main electricity subsidies. The Tariff Stabilization Fund (FET), established in 2004,
is targeted at low-energy users and is intended to cushion tariffs against movements in international oil
prices. The Energy Compensation Fund (FACE), established in 2011, aims to stabilize tariffs for all users, and

percent of GDP, while post-tax subsidies are estimated to be about US$60mn higher on account of foregone
tax revenues.
Lower oil prices and an increase in tariffs are expected
to reduce the fiscal burden in 2015. Tariffs have been
increased in January 2015 by between 6 and 25 percent,
for about one-fourth of consumers. Coupled with lower
oil prices, this is expected to cause a significant reduction
in subsidies from the levels envisaged in the 2015 budget
(prepared in September 2014), which projected electricity
subsidies at about US$350mn.

C. Bolstering Financial System Resilience
22.
The banking sector remains generally healthy, but greater vigilance will be needed in
the context of slowing growth. The banking system is well-capitalized and profitable, but pockets
of vulnerability exist. Strong lending activity in recent years has generally not impaired credit quality,
as evidenced by a low nonperforming loan ratio (below 2 percent). Capital buffers are well above the
required Basel I minimum, profit margins are large, and liquidity holdings remain ample as banks
self-insure against sudden stops. Credit risk stress-tests conducted by the mission confirm that
banks would be able to withstand significant real and financial shocks. However, the authorities
need to continue enhancing cross-border supervision and the monitoring of idiosyncratic, systemic,
and external risks. For example, developing an indicator of core liquidity and analyses of the
transmission of financial shocks would be valuable.
23.
Macrofinancial linkages also need to be monitored closely. Mortgage delinquencies
stand at just below 5 percent of loans, household indebtedness is growing faster than the economy,
and there are signs of overcapacity in segments of the commercial real estate market. These
growing imbalances may dampen price developments and construction activity, which underscores
the need for active macroprudential policies. Macroprudential policy-making is still at an early stage,
and recent efforts to collect real estate price data need to be complemented with additional
information (such as on commercial real estate prices and corporate leverage). Efforts should be
made to develop instruments (such as loan-to-value and debt-service-to-income ratios) and build a
coherent macroprudential policy framework.
24.
The authorities need to undertake further steps to fully implement the
recommendations of the 2011 Financial Sector Assessment Program (FSAP) (Annex III). A key
priority is to create a facility for the provision of temporary liquidity to banks (which may need to be
financed with public funds initially). Although the nonbank financial sector is relatively small3, there
is a need for upgrading legislation on nonbank financial intermediaries—especially cooperatives and
insurance companies, but also trust funds and public accountants—in order to improve the
regulation, supervision, and accountability of these entities. A deposit insurance scheme for small
deposits would protect the majority of depositors, mitigate the risk of runs, and complement social
protection policies.
25.
The authorities broadly concurred with the need for such reforms. They pointed to
recent efforts to adopt parts of Basel II/III banking regulations, improve loan classification and
provisioning, identify systemically important banks, monitor systemic risks, and improve the bank
supervisor’s financial stability report. They plan to revisit the accounting regulation for insurance
companies in light of international standards. The authorities do not perceive significant financial
stability risks at present, as they see economic prospects as being favorable over the next five years.
However, they share the concern about the weakening of relations with corresponding banks. They

consider financial sector exposures to the real estate as still healthy, despite some excesses in the
commercial segment.

D. Ensuring a Sustainable and Inclusive Growth Path
26.
Sustaining future growth will require steady improvements in training, education,
healthcare, and institutions. Economic growth has facilitated important progress in poverty
reduction over the past decade (see Figure 6). Going forward, capital accumulation in the public
sector is expected to decelerate, and growth will need to depend much more on raising productivity.
It will be essential to continue efforts to improve the quality of public education and healthcare,
address skill mismatches including through internship and training programs, promote greater
female labor force participation (e.g. by increasing the flexibility of working arrangements), and
strengthen institutions. To secure enhancement in the quality of education, the authorities need to
make sure that the two large increases in teachers’ salary planned over the next few years are
adequately anchored to advancements in teachers’ qualifications. The authorities indicated that they
are undertaking a concerted effort to improve education, enhance job qualifications, reduce skills
mismatches, tackle youth unemployment, and integrate foreign workers.
27.
Staff analysis suggests that there are signs that the current account deficit is excessive,
but this is expected to self-adjust as investment projects wind down and exports increase
(Annex IV). The current account continues to be financed by FDI, while the external debt is deemed
sustainable and resilient to shocks (Annex V). There is no compelling evidence of a need for an
adjustment in the real exchange rate. Authorities are not overly concerned about the current
account deficit and indicated that the economy has historically shown ample flexibility in responding
to changes in the external environment.

E. Other Issues
28.
Staff encouraged the authorities to formulate an exit strategy for the price controls.
The authorities should take advantage of the declining international food and fuel prices and phase
out price controls by mid-year. If there are concerns over noncompetitive behavior of food
retailers—a principal motivation for the price controls—these should be tackled through an antitrust framework. The authorities mentioned that the legal process to implement effective anti-trust
measures can extend over several years, and that the Constitution itself limits the entrance of
foreign players in the retail market.
29.
Statistics need to be significantly improved. There is an urgent need to publish the full
2007-base national accounts and to improve data reporting for other series relevant for
macroeconomic monitoring. Beyond national accounts, weaknesses are particularly evident in
balance of payment statistics: official statistics may severely underestimate oil imports and service
exports as well as stocks of outward FDI and inward portfolio equity (on the basis of what reported
by other countries). Timeliness and consistency of data reporting needs to be improved. Gaps in
financial sector data (such as real estate prices and corporate leverage) also limit the authorities’

ability to properly assess financial sector risks. The authorities indicated they are making progress
towards the SDDS subscription, and that limited budgetary resources and weak collaboration
among government agencies is slowing down the process.

STAFF APPRAISAL
30.
Given the risks to Panama’s economy, it is essential to fully bring the financial
integrity framework in line with the international standard. After the FATF identified Panama as
having strategic AML/CFT deficiencies in 2014, maintaining correspondent relationships with foreign
banks and conducting international trade and banking transactions has become to some extent
more challenging, although with modest overall impact so far. The authorities are clearly committed
to implementing the recommendations of the IMF AML/CFT assessment and the action plan agreed
with the FATF. The passing of a new anti-money laundering law in April 2015 is a crucial step. It is
now essential that they continue with their efforts in this regard.
31.
Strengthening the fiscal framework is a priority. The authorities should refrain from
changing the SFRL ceilings and should review the threshold for the Canal contribution in the fiscal
framework that allows for the overall fiscal deficit to be above the SFRL deficit ceilings (that apply to
the adjusted fiscal deficit) at current projections (or consider alternative smoothing frameworks), in
order to strengthen the fiscal anchor. The authorities should also consider lowering the level and
broadening the definition of the net debt target that is embedded in the SFRL. The need for larger
fiscal buffers is highlighted by exposures to shocks and contingent liabilities, large unfunded future
pension liabilities, and the temporary financing needs of a liquidity facility to backstop the banks.
The net debt definition could be broadened to include for example other outstanding public
liabilities and liquid public financial assets. Finally, a more explicit accountability framework will also
need to be put in place.
32.
Policy efforts should be devoted to raising tax revenues and streamlining current
expenditures. The authorities should speed up the process of enhancing the capacity and efficiency
of the DGI, while strengthening tax collection and reviewing tax policy. Addressing the unfunded
pension liabilities will require not only public funding but also reforming the pension system. The
planned improvement in the level and targeting of electricity subsidies is welcome, as well as the
authorities’ broader objective of aligning tariffs with costs through the existing automatic
adjustment framework. Efforts in improving targeting should also be undertaken for other subsidies.
33.
Concerted effort should be made to fully implement the 2011 FSAP recommendations.
The authorities are enhancing financial sector regulation, including steps to align capital regulation
with the Basel III framework and to require minimum capital for financial holding companies. Given
the system’s openness and the lack of a lender of last resort, a key priority is to create a facility for
the provision of temporary liquidity to banks, while small deposits could be protected via a deposit
insurance scheme. Legislation for the nonbank financial sector should be modernized.

34.
It is essential to enhance the ability to monitor and assess idiosyncratic, systemic, and
external risks in the financial sector. There is also a need to monitor closely macrofinancial
linkages as well as build a macroprudential policy framework and continue developing the
corresponding tools—for example to mitigate potential adverse developments in the real estate
sector.
35.
Sustaining equitable and inclusive growth will require steady improvements in
training, education, healthcare, and institutions. Going forward, productivity is likely to gain
more importance as a key engine of growth. Given the inevitable lags in influencing productivity, it
is crucial to intensify efforts in areas that still need progress, for example by improving the quality of
public education and healthcare, addressing skill mismatches through internship and training
programs, promoting greater female labor force participation (e.g. by increasing the flexibility of
working arrangements), and strengthening institutions. Doing so will enhance human capital, reduce
skills shortages and youth unemployment, improve the business environment, as well as raise
productivity and living standards.
36.
Advantage should be taken of the decline in international food and fuel prices to
phase out price controls by mid-year. Concerns over noncompetitive behavior of food retailers
should be tackled through an anti-trust framework.
37.
Statistics need to be significantly improved. There is an urgent need to publish the full
2007-base national accounts, improve data reporting for series relevant for macroeconomic
monitoring and for risk assessment (such as national accounts, government finance, financial sector,
and balance of payment statistics), including with respect to their timeliness and consistency.
38.
It is proposed that the next Article IV consultation takes place on the standard
12-month cycle.

Annex I. Implementation of Past IMF Policy Advice
The authorities’ macroeconomic policies over the last year have been broadly in line with past Fund
advice. Some reforms have been delayed by the election and change in administration. During
the 2014 Article IV consultation, Directors emphasized that continued commitment to strong
macroeconomic and financial policies as well as structural reforms would be important to safeguard
against external and domestic shocks, and to support strong and sustainable growth. Directors
underscored that the credibility of the fiscal framework needs to be strengthened and fiscal stance
tightened to provide a cushion against external shocks. Directors encouraged swift implementation of
the remaining 2011 FSAP recommendations, and underscored the importance of stepping up efforts to
strengthen the AML/CFT regime, including implementation of the recommendations of the AML/CFT
assessment report. They encouraged the authorities to further enhance the quality of public education
and upgrade skills of the labor force.
Fiscal policy. Staff advised the authorities to keep the fiscal deficit below the SFRL ceiling. In 2014,
fiscal deficit exceeded the SFRL ceiling mainly due to overspending of the previous administration
and underperformance of revenues. Going forward, the fiscal framework allows the fiscal deficit to
exceed the SFRL ceilings up to the amount that budget contributions from the Canal are below
3.5 percent of GDP. The authorities have started to review the current fiscal framework and taken
measures to increase revenues. A new platform for public sector financial information management
(ISTMO) is being adopted. Its full implementation would facilitate upgrading the public sector
accounting standard and the implementation of a Single Treasury Account.
Financial sector reforms. Further progress has been made in implementing the 2011 FSAP
recommendations. The authorities issued a regulation on the Consolidated Supervision of Banking
Groups in August 2014. Steps have been taken to adopt the international financial reporting
standards and align capital regulation with the Basel III framework. Banks are required to take
measures to identify the ultimate beneficiaries of their corporate clients. The Financial Coordination
Council is becoming more active in the identifying and monitoring systemic risk.
Transparency. The authorities are clearly committed to implementing the recommendations of the
IMF AML/CFT assessment and the action plan agreed with the FATF. In February 2015, the FATF
recognized steps being taken to address the deficiencies in the AML/CFT framework, and indicated
that the authorities should continue pressing ahead with their work agenda. A new anti-money
laundering law was passed by the National Assembly in April 2015.
More inclusive growth. The authorities are enhancing social protection programs and evaluating
how to better target them. Reforms to the education system include deeper emphasis on computer
and language skills as well as on the training of teachers. To address skill mismatches and shortages,
vocational education is being improved and a job market database (encompassing both
employment opportunities and potential job applicants) has been initiated.

In light of the dollarization, a
stronger dollar implies real

Reduction in exports due to
subdued external demand as well
as lower receipts from the Canal
due to weaker global trade. The
adverse impact upon economic

in the Colon Free Zone given its
high reliance on foreign trade.

Domestic Risks
Severe disruption in the ability to

settlements, difficulty in obtaining
cross-border borrowing, and
potential decline in FDI.
Negative effects on growth and
employment in the short term and
exports and revenues in the

1/ The Risk Assessment Matrix (RAM) shows events that could materially alter the baseline path (the scenario most likely to materialize in the
view of IMF staff). The relative likelihood of risks listed is the staff’s subjective assessment of the risks surrounding the baseline (“low” is meant
to indicate a probability below 10 percent, “medium” a probability between 10 and 30 percent, and “high” a probability between 30 and 50
percent). The RAM reflects staff views on the source of risks and overall level of concern as of the time of discussions with the authorities. Nonmutually exclusive risks may interact and materialize jointly.

Annex III. Implementation of 2011 FSAP Recommendations
Recommendation

Status/Expected Completion Date
Banking Oversight

Finalize and implement regulations on operational and
interest rate risks.
Enhance systemic risk monitoring and the capacity to
implement macro-prudential policies.

The SBP issued a regulation on operational and market risk in
December 2011 and has plans to introduce capital charges for these risks
in 2016.
 A new credit regulation incorporating dynamic provisioning and
accounting treatment of restructured loans was issued in May 2013.



The Financial Coordination Council was established and continues
to strengthen its capacity in order to implement macroprudential
policies.



Develop capital adequacy and regulatory reporting
standards for holding companies.

A regulation on the Consolidated Supervision of Banking Groups
was released in August 2014.
 A draft law on Trust Funds was released in January 2015; legislation
on Certified Public Accountants is pending but a register for
external accountants is being established.
Regulation establishing a minimum capital requirement for bank
holdings was issued in February 2015, while also aligning capital
requirements for banks with Basel III rules.

Develop concentration limits and risk management
requirements for interbank deposits.

No plans to develop such requirements. The authorities noted that the
law allows them to introduce such limits and requirements for individual
banks as needed.

Enhance offsite supervision to develop a view on
macroprudential and systemic risk trends.



Off-site supervision was improved in 2012 through requirement for
banks to report monthly performance and early warning indicators
to the SBP.



The SBP has developed methodologies to identify systemically
important banks and measure interconnectedness between banks.



The SBP was initiated an upgrade of its Financial Stability Report (to
be published now on a semi-annual basis).

Regulate and effectively supervise cooperatives that
provide credit and savings products.

A draft law on cooperatives, which would upgrade regulation and
strengthen supervision in that sector, continues to be developed.

Insurance Sector Oversight
Approve draft Insurance Law with strengthened
prudential requirements.

The law creating the Superintendencia of Insurance was adopted in 2012
(Ley 12-2012).

Strengthen disclosure of performance indicators and
brokers’ commissions.

Not implemented.

Securities Market Oversight
Strengthen the budgetary position, and the
supervisory and enforcement capabilities of the
supervisor (National Securities Commission).

Law 67 (dated 1 September 2011) upgraded the Commission to a
Superintendency (SMV), strengthening its supervisory and enforcement
capacity as well as its budgetary position. Further strengthening the
enforcement capacity of the SMV is needed.

Annex IV. External Sector Assessment

1/ The MB approach calculates the norm in the current account to GDP ratio (CA/Y), based on an approach similar to
the IMF External Balance Assessment methodology (EBA), adding Panama to the EBA sample. The ES
approach calculates the difference between the underlying CA to GDP ratio (2014, adjusted for output gap) and the
CA to GDP ratio stabilizing the 2014 NFA to GDP ratio. The REER approach uses EBA-like regressions to explain the
REER. CA/Y and NFA/Y are measured in percent of GDP. REER is measured in percent. The MB Approach with
Medium-Term current account presents an underlying current account where exports are adjusted for risk.

Panama’s current account deficit remains elevated, but the gap is closing fast over the
medium term. The CA deficit has been larger than the value explained by fundamentals and
desirable policies since mid-2000s—apart from the sharp adjustment during the global crisis—and
the gap is now about 6 percent (see the Annex table). The ES methodology points to a somewhat
smaller but still large CA imbalance. However, the MB and ES gaps fail to capture the impact on the
current account of temporarily high investment which, over the medium term, will raise both
productive capacity and exports and facilitate a correction in the CA temporary imbalance.
Accounting for the reduction in investment and the increase in exports over the medium term, the
deviation of the CA from fundamentals would be around 1 percent of GDP. Strong and stable FDI
inflows are expected to continue to finance the bulk of external CA deficits in the coming years
(Table 7), and external debt is deemed sustainable and resilient to shocks (see Annex V).
The REER does not appear misaligned. The REER depreciated substantially in the early 2000s and
subsequently started appreciating as inflation picked up. In 2014 the REER depreciated by 2 percent
due to lower inflation than in Panama’s trading partners (most notably due to the high inflation in
Venezuela which makes up 10 percent of total trade). Excluding Venezuela, REER appreciated in
2014 by about 2 percent and the REER model points to a slight overvaluation (4 percent).
Panama remains the second most competitive economy in Latin America, after Chile. When
compared to its overall Global Competitiveness Index, Panama’s strengths are in financial market
development, infrastructure, and goods market efficiency The main challenges remain in labor
market efficiency, healthcare and primary education, institutions, and higher education and training.
Panama is behind Colombia, Peru and Chile in the 2015 Doing Business report, with its main
strengths being reported in “trading across border” and “access to credit”, and weaknesses in “ease
of paying taxes” and “resolving insolvency”.

1/ Public sector debt and financing needs includes those of the Non-Financial Public Sector and the external finacing needs of the Panama Canal expansion. .
2/ Based on available data.
3/ Long-term bond spread over U.S. bonds.
4/ Defined as interest payments divided by debt stock (excluding guarantees) at the end of previous year.
5/ Derived as [(r - π(1+g) - g + ae(1+r)]/(1+g+π+gπ)) times previous period debt ratio, with r = interest rate; π = growth rate of GDP deflator; g = real GDP growth rate;
a = share of foreign-currency denominated debt; and e = nominal exchange rate depreciation (measured by increase in local currency value of U.S. dollar).
6/ The real interest rate contribution is derived from the numerator in footnote 5 as r - π (1+g) and the real growth contribution as -g.
7/ The exchange rate contribution is derived from the numerator in footnote 5 as ae(1+r).
8/ Includes asset changes and interest revenues (if any). For projections, includes exchange rate changes during the projection period.
9/ Assumes that key variables (real GDP growth, real interest rate, and other identified debt-creating flows) remain at the level of the last projection year.

1/ The external debt excludes the offshore banks.
2/ Derived as [r - g - ρ(1+g) + εα(1+r)]/(1+g+ρ+gρ) times previous period debt stock, with r = nominal effective interest rate on external debt; ρ = change in domestic GDP deflator in US dollar terms,
g = real GDP growth rate, ε = nominal appreciation (increase in dollar value of domestic currency, equal to zero for Panama), and α = share of domestic-currency denominated debt in total external debt.
3/ The contribution from price and exchange rate changes is defined as [-r(1+g) + εα(1+r)]/(1+g+ρ+gρ) times previous period debt stock. ρ increases with an appreciating domestic currency (ε > 0)
and rising inflation (based on GDP deflator). Given ε = 0 for Panama, this term becomes -ρ(1+g)/(1+g+ρ+gρ).
4/ For projection, line includes the impact of price and exchange rate changes.
5/ Defined as current account deficit, plus amortization on medium- and long-term debt, plus short-term debt at end of previous period.
6/ The key variables include real GDP growth; nominal interest rate; dollar deflator growth; and both non-interest current account and non-debt inflows in percent of GDP.
7/ Long-run, constant balance that stabilizes the debt ratio assuming that key variables (real GDP growth, nominal interest rate, dollar deflator growth, and non-debt inflows in percent of GDP) remain
at their levels of the last projection year.

Colombia are expected to come
into effect in 2015. The agreement with Mexico will eliminate almost all tariffs in goods within five
years of coming into effect. The FTA with Colombia will immediately suppress import tariffs on 49
percent of manufacturing goods, with another 50 percent to become duty free within twelve years. It
also establishes duty-free quotas on primary products, with the quotas progressively increasing over
time. Panama is an observant state in the Pacific Alliance, composed by Chile, Colombia, Mexico and
Peru.2 Signing FTAs with all four members is a prerequisite for accession to the Alliance.

The share of trade with FTA partner countries is rising rapidly. Partner countries with which an
FTA is currently in force represented about 45 percent of trade in goods, and 40 percent of FDI
inflows, in 2013. More precisely, exports and imports with partners with FTAs currently in force

indicate that, all else equal,
signing an FTA increases bilateral trade by 77 percent.3 Given their weights in bilateral trade, the
FTAs with the U.S. and the European Union are expected to increase Panama’s total trade by about
18 percent and 7 percent, respectively. Similarly, the FTAs with Mexico and Colombia would cause
an increase in trade of about 6 percent. The FTAs that have been signed with major partners will also
support FDI flows over the medium term.

See unabridged version of Rose (2004, “Do We Really Know That the WTO Increases Trade?” American Economic
Review, Vol. 94 No. 1, pp. 98-114). The specification including tariffs and fixed effects has a point estimate of 0.57
(s.e. of 0.18), which translates into an increase in trade of exp(0.57)-1, or 77 percent (see Appendix 6). Most other
estimates in the paper point to even larger effects.

Safeguards Assessment
Under the Fund’s safeguards assessment policy, the National Bank of Panama (NBP) was subject to
the transitional procedures with respect to the Stand-By Arrangement, which was approved on June
30, 2000, and expired on March 29, 2002. The transitional procedures required a review of the NBP’s
external audit mechanism only. The assessment was completed on July 12, 2001 and concluded that
NBP’s external audit mechanism was at the time adequate.

Non-financial Relations
Exchange Rate Arrangement
Panama uses the U.S. dollar as the primary means of payment in the local economy. Its national
currency (balboa) is issued in the form of coins only and serves as a unit of account. The exchange
rate of the balboa is fixed at B 1 per U.S. dollar. Panama has accepted the obligations of Article VIII,
Sections 2(a), 3, and 4, and maintains an exchange system that is free of restrictions on the making
of payments and transfers for current international transactions.
Last Article IV Consultation
The 2014 Article IV consultation was concluded on May 9, 2014. Panama is on the standard 12
month consultation cycle.
FSAP: A first-time FSAP was concluded in September 2011. It confirmed the banking sector’s
strength and resilience to potential shocks, noting nonetheless that data gaps prevent a full analysis
of macro-financial linkages. It concluded that the regulatory framework for banks was broadly
adequate, but the regulation of nonbanks had important shortcomings. It recommended to build
the capacity to monitor systemic risks and introduce a financial safety net, including a facility aimed
at addressing temporary liquidity shortfalls and a limited deposit insurance fund.
Technical Assistance
Panama is a large recipient of technical assistance (TA) directly through the Fund or CAPTACDR.
Latest assistance concentrated in the area of the national accounts, both on output compilation and
producer price and export and import prices. Assistance was also provided in improving the external
sector statistics. Assistance in the fiscal area included the practical application of the accounting
policies established in the International Public Sector Accounting Standards (IPSAS), implementation
of the single treasury account and medium-term expenditure framework. CAPTAC is delivering TA
support in the areas of tax administration. In the financial area, TA concentrated mostly on
improving financial supervision, and on International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) adoption.
Resident Representative: None.

STATISTICAL ISSUES
(As of March 25, 2015)

ASSESSMENT OF DATA ADEQUACY FOR SURVEILLANCE
General: Data provided to the Fund has some shortcomings but is broadly adequate for surveillance.
The accuracy, timeliness, and publication of economic statistics has improved, but weaknesses in
national accounts, government finance, and balance of payment statistics need to be addressed.
Real Sector: Although the timeliness of real sector data provision has improved, the data are often
subject to sizable revisions. Preparation to change the base year of the national accounts (NA) to 2007
started in the second half of 2010 and preliminary rebased NA data from the production approach were
published in March 2013. Preliminary NA data from the expenditure and income approaches will
tentatively be available by the end of first semester 2015 with the compilation of the 2008-2012 supply
and use tables. The IMF national accounts technical assistance mission conducted in 2010-11 noted slow
progress in expanding coverage of financial activity as well as the overestimation of the deflator used to
calculate the financial services output at constant prices. Since 2011, progress was made in compiling
financial intermediation services indirectly measured (FISIM) on a monthly basis following the 2008
System of National Accounts (2008 SNA), as well as in broadening the coverage of household output,
employment, compensation of employees, and mixed income in informal activities for 2007-2012 due to
the progress in the compilation of employment matrices. Quarterly GDP data and the monthly economic
activity index have benefited from the use of monthly VAT records as source data, and from the correct
application of the Denton Proportional method for aligning quarterly data to annual data (reducing
further revisions) and X13 ARIMA-SEATS for seasonally and calendar-adjusting the quarterly series. In
addition, IMF technical assistance has been provided to develop updated producer, export, and import
price indices and to support the development of the quarterly economic surveys to non-financial
enterprises.
Government finance statistics: Further efforts are needed to improve the quality of fiscal data. Apart
from timeliness, consistency of data related to the transfers between public sector units should be
improved; and the coverage of the public enterprises should be made universal. Since September 2004,
the operational balance of the Panama Canal Authority (ACP) was excluded from the official definition of
the nonfinancial public sector (NFPS) used for fiscal policy purposes. Information on the ACP is only
available in the Annual Report posted in its website (www.pancanal.com) on a fiscal year basis. There is a
need to ensure a consistent and timely flow of ACP statistics on a calendar year basis. Moreover, in 2011,
three public enterprises have been excluded from the NFPS accounts and public debt (Tocumen
International Airport, ETESA, an electricity distribution company, and ENA, the National Highway
company). It would also be necessary to compile and disseminate information on these entities in a
timely fashion. The 2012 decree establishing the Savings Fund of Panama (Fundo Ahorro de Panama, or
FAP) mandated reporting of deferred payment schemes (e.g. turnkey projects) in budget documentation.
The authorities are receiving technical assistance from the IMF Statistics Department (STA) to implement
the Government Finance Statistics Manual 2001 (GFSM 2001) and the Fiscal Affairs Department (FAD)
conducted a mission on observance of fiscal standards and codes (ROSC) in October 2005. The
authorities, however, cannot elaborate fiscal statistics in accordance with GFSM 2001 without a priori
reforming public accounting. The August 2012 CAPTAC report on fiscal statistics for financial
programming also emphasized the need to increase the information and analysis of turnkey projects’
6

ASSESSMENT OF DATA ADEQUACY FOR SURVEILLANCE (concluded)
impact on fiscal sustainability. In 2011 through 2013, FAD provided technical assistance in the area of
public accounting, including implementation of government accounting reforms and the practical
application of the accounting policies established in the International Public Sector Accounting
Standards (IPSAS), an important step toward improving fiscal transparency. The financial accounting
system was not prepared to support the recording of transactions and economic events under the
accrual method. The authorities launched a new platform for centralized management of public sector
financial information (Integración y Soluciones Tecnológicas del Modelo de Gestión Operativa, ISTMO),
which would help enhance transparency and efficiency. Panama reports limited fiscal data to STA (for
publication in the International Financial Statistics or the Government Finance Statistics Yearbook).
Monetary and Financial Statistics: Panama regularly reports monetary data for depository corporations
using the standardized report forms (SRFs) for publication in the International Financial Statistics.
Panama participated in a regional project for harmonizing monetary and financial statistics in Central
America and the Dominican Republic, supported by CAPTAC. The aim was to facilitate cross-country
comparison and regional analysis. The second stage of the harmonization project developed a work
program to expand the institutional coverage to include other depository corporations and all other
financial corporations (OFCs). In February 2014, Panama started to report Financial Soundness Indicators
(FSIs) to STA on a regular (quarterly) basis with data beginning on 2005. Data gaps prevent a deeper
analysis of systemic risks as the authorities do not collect adequate data on real estate prices, loan writeoffs, loan-to-value ratios, and leverage indicators for households and corporate.
Balance of payments: Weaknesses in foreign trade flows calculations, particularly those involving the
Colon Free Zone, need to be addressed. Substantial changes in the composition of trade flows over the
last decade render the current methodology to estimate volume indices obsolete. Oil imports and
service exports may have been underestimated. Quarterly data are available with a delay of about one
quarter, and are subject to revisions thereafter. Revised estimates in key trade and investment data may
result in substantial revisions of the current account of the balance of payments. These revisions may
reflect improvements in coverage, but they also suggest that there is room for improvement in quality
control procedures. Data on outward FDI and repatriation of profit and dividends from these
investments are only collected from the financial private sector, implying that the current account deficit
and the International Investment Position (IIP) are likely being overestimated, due to the lack of coverage
of outward FDI of the nonfinancial private sector. Official statistics may also underestimate inward
portfolio investment. The authorities conducted Coordinated Direct Investment Survey (CDIS) and
Coordinated Portfolio Investment Survey (CPIS) to improve external sector data quality in the context of
CAPTAC Regional Harmonization Project of External Sector Statistics (RHPESS). Quarterly IIP data have
been compiled since 2002, and annual data are available since 1998. TA has also been provided on the
definition, compilation and dissemination of international reserves.

DATA STANDARDS AND QUALITY
Panama has participated in the Fund’s General Data Dissemination System (GDDS) since December 2000,
but the metadata need to be updated. A data ROSC was published in October 2006. Following an SDDS
assessment mission conducted by STA in April 2011, and in November 2013, the authorities have a work
program aimed at meeting the requirements for Panama’s subscription to the SDDS. An action plan has
been prepared and followed up by subsequent missions.

Statement by Paulo Nogueira Batista, Executive Director for Panama,
Oliveira Lima, Alternate Executive Director,
and Alfredo Maciá, Advisor to the Executive Director
June 10, 2015
1.
The Panamanian authorities thank the IMF staff for their constructive assessment of
the country’s macroeconomic developments and policies. They also welcomed the Selected
Issues paper, which covers topics of relevance for future reforms and policy decisions.
Recent Economic Developments
2.
In spite of some moderation, Panama’s economy continues to grow at a fast rate.
Real GDP increased by 6.2 percent in 2014, compared to 8.4 percent in 2013.1
Unemployment remains close to historical lows, at 4.8 percent in 2014. According to
projections by the Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean, Panama's
economy will, once again, grow at the highest rate in Latin America in 2015 (7 percent).
Growth will average 6.5 percent per year over the next five years according to staff’s forecast
and 6.7 percent according to the administration’s projections in the 2016-2020 Medium Term
Fiscal Framework (MTFF).
3.
Achieving sustained and equitable growth is a key objective of the Panamanian
government’s five-year investment plan. The plan places an emphasis on social projects in
priority areas – such as housing, education, water and sanitation, transportation, and security
– and will be developed in tandem with major infrastructure projects, among which the Canal
expansion, the second line of Panama City’s metro, a new copper mine, and the fourth bridge
over the Panama Canal to be bid in the third quarter of 2015. Gross domestic investment will
remain elevated, close to 30 percent of GDP, as can be seen from the data provided in the
staff report.
4.
Panama remains the only country in Latin America that can exhibit “Asian” growth
and investment rates. Our chair believes that Panama’s experience with rapid development
over a long period may hold important lessons for other countries, particularly in Latin
America. It shows for instance the crucial importance of a coordinated public and private
investment drive, with decisive participation of national authorities, in lifting the country’s
development horizon.
5.
End-of-year consumer price inflation declined to 1.0 percent in 2014 from 3.7 in
2013. Lower commodity prices, particularly oil, and the price control policy on 22 foodbasket products helped curb inflation. The number of products under price controls will
remain the same until July 2015, and the authorities note that no supply shortages of those
products were detected to date.

1

GDP-related data in this buff statement take into account the change in the base year from 1996 to 2007, in
accordance with the March 2015 report of the National Statistics Institute (http://www.contraloria.gob.pa/inec/).

6.
The current account deficit decreased only slightly in 2014, to 12.0 percent of GDP.
This large deficit, however, should not lead to erroneous conclusions. Infrastructure projects
with high import content continue to broadly account for this external deficit. They also
explain the composition of the capital account surplus, which is mostly associated with

Fiscal Policy and Public Financial Management
7.
Soon after the new administration took office on July 1st, 2014, the Ministry of
Economy and Finance (MEF) implemented a rigorous expenditures contention plan.
Additionally, a moratorium law was approved, allowing late tax payments to be settled
without interest and other surcharges until the end of 2014. The two measures combined had
a fiscal impact of over 1 percent of GDP. Nonetheless, given the slippages which had
occurred in the first half of the year, the National Assembly approved an increase in the
ceiling established in the Social and Fiscal Responsibility Law (SFRL) for the non-financial
public sector (NFPS) deficit from 2.7 to 4.1 percent of GDP in 2014. The final outturn of the
NFPS deficit was however considerably lower, reaching 3.4 percent of GDP, according to
information provided to us by the MEF.
8.
From 2015 onwards, a provision in the law of Panama’s Sovereign Wealth Fund
(Fondo de Ahorro de Panamá – FAP) will enter into effect, establishing that contributions to
the National Treasury from the Panama Canal Authority (Autoridade del Canal de Panamá –
ACP) in excess of 3.5 percent of GDP be deposited in the FAP. The authorities note that this
provision was already present in the text of Law 38, of 2012, which created the FAP and was
developed with the advice of the IMF. The provision also establishes that the fiscal deficit
ceiling should be applied to the “adjusted NFPS deficit”, calculated as the overall fiscal
deficit adjusted by the difference between ACP’s contributions and 3.5 percent of GDP. To
face past commitments on capital expenditures, the authorities decided to use the additional
room provided by projected ACP contributions of 1.8 percent of GDP in 2015 and,
accordingly, budgeted the NFPS deficit for the year at 3.7 percent of GDP, instead of
2 percent as originally provided for in the SFRL.
9.
According to MEF’s estimations, NFPS debt (excluding debt of the ACP) increased
in 2014 to 39.5 percent of GDP, up from 36.8 percent in 2013. It is however expected to
return to the declining trend observed between 2005 and 2013, and reach the target of
34 percent of GDP by end-2020, as established in the MTFF. Credit rating agencies recently
confirmed the investment grade of Panama’s sovereign debt, emphasizing the dynamism and
diversification of the economy.2 In line with these ratings and assessments, Panama issued in
March 2015 a USD 1.25 billion ten-year bond priced at a spread of 178 basis points above

Panama’s sovereign debt ratings are currently BBB according to Fitch and Standard and Poor's, and Baa2
according to Moody's, all of which with a stable outlook.

ten-year U.S. Treasury bonds. Such spread is very low by historical standards and
corresponds to an effective interest rate of 3.89 percent per annum.
10.
The MEF is strengthening the re-established directorate of general revenues
(Dirección General de Ingresos – DGI). The revenue authority that was created in
April 2013 to replace the DGI was declared unconstitutional and ordered dissolved in
October 2014. The DGI is being reinforced through an increased budget, new hires, more
intensive training, and improvements in information systems to allow cross-referencing tax
information.
11.
Considerable improvements are also being made in public financial management. The
new centralized financial operations system will be fully operational by end-2015 in all
central government agencies. The implementation of the Single Treasury Account will be
completed over the next two to three years. These two initiatives are expected to
considerably improve the controls, efficiency, and accountability of government finances.
12.
The authorities have made significant progress in reducing electricity subsidies and
related budget allocations since the beginning of 2015. Electricity subsidies are being more
effectively targeted so as to benefit homes and small businesses consuming less than
400 kWh per month. The authorities project that this will reduce electricity subsidies from
USD 400 million in 2014 to USD 62 million in 2015.
Financial sector
13.
The banking system remains stable, well capitalized, and highly liquid. Several
indicators reported by the Superintendence of Banks (Superintendencia de Bancos de
Panamá – SBP) have improved further at end-2014, from already comfortable levels at end2013, as can be seen in Box 2 and Table 5 of the staff report. The capital adequacy ratio
(CAR) stood at 14.8 percent, well above the statutory 8 percent requirement. According to
the SBP, credit to the private sector increased 11.7 percent – mainly to housing, domestic
consumption, and construction – and deposits were up 8 percent in 2014.
14.
The regulatory and supervisory framework for the banking sector continues to be
enhanced. Banking regulations were issued in 2014 on cross-border consolidated supervision
and, in January 2015, on banks’ capital requirements following Basel III standards. Banks
and banking groups will be required to increase their capital starting in January 2016 and to
be fully compliant with Basel III by 2019. The SBP has also widened its supervisory network
to include, apart from banks, other financial institutions such as leasing and factoring
companies, financial cooperatives, fund-remittance companies, and debit and credit card
companies.

Anti-Money Laundering and Combating the Financing of Terrorism
15.
The authorities have made substantial progress in Anti-Money Laundering and
Combating the Financing of Terrorism (AML/CFT). An Action Plan agreed with the
Financial Action Task Force (FATF) to strengthen Panama’s AML/CFT framework will be
reviewed by that organization by end-June 2015. Key legal, institutional and legislative
actions have been implemented to date, including:

An AML/CFT Policy Unit was created in the MEF last October. The unit has
issued policy guidelines and strengthened coordination among anti-money laundering
domestic institutions, including the Financial Intelligence Unit.

Budget allocations for the Financial Intelligence Unit tripled in 2015. This
will significantly strengthen the unit’s technical capabilities, improve its response
capacity, and enhance its cooperation with international counterparts.

New penal code legislation was approved in March this year classifying as
crimes additional activities related to money laundering and financing of terrorism
and also creating conditions for improved judicial assistance and cooperation with
foreign institutions.

New AML/CFT legislation was approved by the National Assembly on April
27, 2015 to strengthen controls and reinforce domestic and international cooperation
– a crucial measure in the Action Plan to allow Panama to exit the FATF’s grey-list.
This legislation also creates the Intendance of Supervision and Regulations, within
the MEF’s structure, to exert surveillance on sixteen sectors of business activities and
professions subject to controls on AML/CFT.
16.
In addition, a new bearer shares law, also approved in April 2015, requires all
common stocks to be registered with an authorized custodian by December 2015. The
former law, of 2013, had a transition period until 2018 to enforce said registration. The new
law also allows converting bearer shares into nominative shares. This measure and all other
initiatives listed above show the determination of the Panamanian authorities in supporting
the role and legitimacy of Panama as a banking center and in strengthening AML/CFT
regulations and institutions.
