STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2014 ARTICLE IV CONSULTATION
June 20, 2014

KEY ISSUES
Context: Solid growth in recent years, supported by high oil prices and output, has
boosted living standards. This year, the economy is slowing down, in large part because
of weaker domestic and external demand, and regional tensions. Inflation is expected to
accelerate temporarily due to the devaluation of the tenge (February 2014). Enhancing
the policy architecture and promoting a business environment unencumbered by the
state remain key challenges for Kazakhstan to become a dynamic emerging market
economy and ensure durable and balanced long-term growth. The recent
reappointment of Prime Minister Massimov was accompanied by the authorities’
commitment to speeding up structural reforms. In this context, the government is
strengthening its links with the multilateral development banks (MDBs). The May
29 signing of the Eurasian Economic Union (EEU), with Russia and Belarus, is not
expected to have near-term economic effects; medium-term effects will depend on how
the Union’s rules and regulations will be implemented.
Focus of consultation and key recommendations: Amid uncertain external and
domestic environments, the consultation focused on policy measures to mitigate shocks
and achieve the authorities’ short- and medium-term objectives, in particular:
(i) restoring confidence and stability in the post-devaluation environment; (ii) resolving
the nonperforming loans (NPL) problem, in line with the recent FSAP recommendations;
(iii) bolstering the monetary and fiscal policy frameworks, as recommended last year; and
(iv) accelerating structural reforms, including the implementation of industrialization and
diversification policies carefully and transparently.
Previous consultation: During the 2013 Article IV Consultation, Directors encouraged
the authorities to take advantage of the positive outlook to strengthen the
macroeconomic policy architecture, including by (i) showing greater determination to
addressing the high level of NPLs; (ii) following through on the planned introduction of a
new policy interest rate to enhance the transmission mechanism of monetary policy; and
(iii) revamping the medium-term fiscal framework through improved coverage and
transparency. Since then, the authorities have been more resolute in dealing with the
NPL problem. However, progress in strengthening the monetary and fiscal policy
frameworks has been slow.

CONTEXT
1.
Solid growth over the past decade, supported by rising oil prices and output, helped
Kazakhstan achieve a middle-income country status, but vulnerabilities remain. High oil prices
helped the economy recover rapidly from the 2008–09 crisis. Output growth has been somewhat
lower in the past three years than the pre-crisis levels but remains strong, while inflation and
employment growth have been relatively stable (Figure 1). At the same time, the banking sector has
been burdened by a legacy of high NPLs from the crisis. While government debt is low and fiscal
buffers are high, state-owned enterprises’ debt, given the large size of their activities, poses
contingent liability risks for the state. Downside domestic and external demand risks weigh on the
outlook for growth.
2.
In the face of slowing economic growth and concerns about external competitiveness,
the National Bank of Kazakhstan (NBK) devalued the local currency by 18 percent in February.
The authorities justified the devaluation by the deterioration in the current account balance, concern
about competitiveness due to depreciation in the Russian ruble, and a fall in central bank
international reserves. The devaluation was accompanied by the introduction of a narrow exchange
rate band. In staff’s assessment, based on CGER-type methodology, the tenge was only moderately
overvalued at end-2013 (Box 1).
3.
Amid uncertain external environment, the reappointment of Prime Minister Massimov
in April was aimed at bolstering confidence and reforms. The direction of macroeconomic policy
is unlikely to be altered significantly, but some new spending plans have been introduced, and
Mr. Massimov, who previously held the Prime Minister position during 2007–12, has signaled his
intention to speed up structural reforms, with the help of the MDBs.

RECENT DEVELOPMENTS
4.
Growth amounted to 6 percent in 2013, but has slowed since then, while inflation has
risen. Growth in 2013 was driven primarily by domestic demand, with household consumption
growing at 9 percent year-on-year, helped by rapid expansion in consumer credit. As a result, the
positive output gap widened, to just below 1 percent of potential GDP. 1 However, preliminary data
in the first quarter of 2014 suggest that real GDP growth has decelerated on the back of: (i) weak
external demand, especially from China; (ii) negative wealth effects for consumers and weaker
investor confidence following the February devaluation and possibly developments in Russia and
Ukraine; and (iii) slower production in the mining sector. At the same time, the devaluation has been
fueling inflation despite some price controls. In May, headline CPI inflation reached 6.9 percent
year-on-year (up from 4.8 percent at end-2013).

Staff uses various methods to calculate the output gap, but estimates remain rough given rapid structural
transformation.

5.
The external position weakened in 2013, although it improved in 2014: Q1 and
vulnerabilities are limited by large buffers.2 The current account turned into a small deficit in
2013, from a surplus averaging over 2 percent of GDP in the preceding three years. The decline was
mainly driven by a sharp fall in non-oil exports (mostly metals and grains). Foreign direct investment
inflows slowed sharply in 2013 as large investment projects, mostly related to the Kashagan oil field,
came to an end. This contributed to a fall in official reserves, by US$3.6 billion to US$24.7 billion
(about 4½ months of imports). Preliminary 2014: Q1 data showed a sharp improvement in the
current account, as imports compressed by US$4 billion (due to slowing demand and some
temporary factors) and exports grew by less than US$1 billion (mostly due to oil exports from last
year’s output). As of end-April, official reserves recovered last year’s losses, reaching just over
US$28 billion, and are considered adequate based on the IMF’s reserve adequacy metric. Moreover,
the country’s overall international investment position, including the assets in the national oil fund
(NFRK), has been on an increasing path.3
6.
The banking sector recovery continued, while vulnerabilities remain due to elevated
NPLs (Figures 2 and 3). Banks’ profits have continued to improve over the past year, albeit
gradually, helped by rapid growth in consumer lending, with the return on assets ratio for the sector
(excluding troubled BTA and Alliance banks) rising to 1.8 percent in 2013 (from 1.3 percent in 2012).
The financial system remains saddled with a large stock of NPLs, at about 32 percent, most of which
is concentrated in three of the seven largest banks. The system’s aggregate capital adequacy ratio
(CAR) has stabilized at around 17 percent, with the Tier I capital ratio at around 13 percent, following
the external debt restructuring and state-funded recapitalization of BTA. The presence of
foreign-owned banks in Kazakhstan continued to decline, with the sale of HSBC subsidiary to Halyk
bank expected to be completed by end-year.
7.
Increasing retail funding and reduced market borrowings in recent years have
improved the profile of banks’ funding, although the dollarization of deposits has sharply

currency denominated wholesale funding has declined markedly, exchange rate-induced credit risk
remains high, and the recent sharp increase in the dollarization of bank deposits (from about
30 percent to around 50 percent of total deposits, in part due to the devaluation) has complicated
the management of tenge liquidity.
8.
Amid tightening tenge liquidity and volatile money market interest rates, the official
refinancing rate remained unchanged, while the NBK deposit rate was raised. The liquidity
tightening was exacerbated by the gradual withdrawal of pension funds from the money market
(due to the unification of pension funds) and speculative pressures on the tenge/USD exchange rate.
In the absence of effective central bank instruments for managing liquidity, including limited use of
refinancing loans or credit auctions, volatility in money market interest rates remained high,
particularly around quarterly tax reporting periods. Despite an unchanged refinancing rate (policy
rate), money market interest rates have trended higher, at times exceeding the refinancing rate by a
large margin (Figures 4 and 5). The authorities increased the NBK deposit rate by 225 basis points to
2.75 percent, hence narrowing the interest rate corridor. Although overnight and seven-day money
market rates have declined significantly recently, banks’ longer-term tenge funding is scarce, in part
due to the rapid increase in the dollarization of time deposits in recent months. To help alleviate this
problem, the NBK has announced the offering of up to US$10 billion in one-year foreign-currency
swap operations with banks, with an implied interest rate of 3 percent (beginning July 1).
9.
Fiscal balances improved significantly in 2013. The overall fiscal surplus widened to
5.2 percent of GDP in 2013, from 4.5 percent of GDP in 2012, as total spending declined by
1.5 percent of GDP compared to 2012 (Figure 6). The reduction of expenditures was due to both
lower current (especially wages and goods and services) and capital spending relative to GDP.
Meanwhile, non-oil tax revenues increased by 0.5 percent of GDP, reversing the declining trend of
the past few years, largely on account of strong VAT receipts. As a result, the non-oil deficit declined
to 7 percent of GDP (from 8.9 percent), compared to an estimated sustainable level of 6 percent of
GDP.4
10.
In response to the devaluation and slowing growth, the 2014 budget was amended in
February and additional off-budget spending was announced. Public wages and social benefits
were increased on average by 10 percent (effective April) to mitigate the negative effects of the
devaluation on real incomes. In addition, a one trillion tenge (US$5.4 billion, or 2½ percent of GDP)
package from NFRK was deployed to serve multiple objectives over a period of two years.
Specifically, out of the 500 billion tenge assigned for the current year half was allocated to
capitalizing the Problem Loan Fund (PLF) and the other half to onlending (via commercial banks) to
SMEs and other priority sectors. On the revenue side, the oil export customs duty was hiked by
30 percent.

4

The sustainable level of non-oil deficit was estimated by staff using a Permanent Income Hypothesis annuity
framework to be 7.5 percent of non-oil GDP, which is equivalent to 6 percent of total GDP.

11.
In recent months, the government has elevated the priority of the structural reform
agenda. In particular, it has actively engaged with international development partners to accelerate
structural reforms, with a focus on improving the investment climate and fostering balanced
regional development. In this context, the government has recently signed partnership agreements
with the ADB and EBRD to support the development of SMEs and the non-oil private sector. In
conjunction with financing of projects and with the aim of supporting lending to SMEs, the NBK has
signed repurchasing (repo) and foreign-currency swap arrangements with the EBRD.5 The
government also recently signed a loan agreement with the World Bank to modernize the
agricultural sector. While Kazakhstan’s economic growth continued to be comparatively inclusive,
recent efforts to further reduce income inequality have been relatively weak.
12.
Kazakhstan is engaged in regional and global economic integration. The newly
launched EEU will formally come into effect in January 2015, with Belarus, Kazakhstan, and Russia as
members. Compared to the existing Eurasian Customs Union, established in 2010 with a common
external import tariff, the EEU envisages the free transit of goods, services, capital, and labor. At the
same time, while the EEU suggests closer economic integration with a number of CIS economies, the
government is also extending collaboration with China and the OECD and aims to finalize WTO
accession this year.

Box 1. Kazakhstan: Assessment of Exchange Rate and External Competitiveness
While the exchange rate and official reserves were under pressure prior to the devaluation, the tenge
did not appear overly uncompetitive. The CPI-based real effective exchange rate (REER) was slightly above
its long-run average before falling about 10 percent below the average following the devaluation.
Based on a CGER-type methodology, the exchange rate appears to have been moderately overvalued
at end-2013. The macroeconomic balance approach suggests that the real exchange rate was overvalued
by about 3 percent (i.e., the exchange rate adjustment required to bring the underlying current account to a
level consistent with its norm). The equilibrium REER approach, which pins the deviation of the REER from its
estimated equilibrium level, suggests that the REER was overvalued by around 6 percent. Under the external
sustainability approach, the current account norm was estimated at 2.1 percent of GDP, which implied an
overvaluation of the tenge by about 4 percent.

Other indicators, furthermore, suggest that Kazakhstan has been gaining competitiveness in recent
years. The global market penetration of Kazakh exports, measured by Kazakh non-oil exports’ share of total
world non-oil exports, has been improving, while the terms-of-trade has been broadly stable. At the same
time, labor productivity has been growing faster than compensation, which has led to gradually declining
unit labor costs.

OUTLOOK AND RISKS
13.
The growth outlook has become less favorable and inflation is projected to increase.
Real GDP growth in 2014 is projected at 4¾ percent, one percentage point below earlier projections,
despite the expected positive contributions from the fiscal stimulus. External demand has weakened
recently, and household consumption growth is projected to decelerate due to lower credit growth
and the negative wealth effect from the devaluation. Moreover, regional tensions and price controls
announced after the devaluation are expected to adversely affect investment plans. Nonetheless,
temporary inflationary pressures are likely to emerge from the devaluation with possible
second-round effects from an increase in wages and social benefits. Staff’s projections suggest
inflation could rise to 9 percent. The authorities, however, are determined to keep inflation within
the central bank’s objective range of 6–8 percent, including through price controls and have for now
maintained their real GDP growth projection of 6 percent for 2014.The current account is projected
to improve to a surplus of 0.6 percent of GDP in 2014. As a result, official international reserves are
expected to rebound to just over US$28 billion at end-2014 (equivalent to 5.2 months of imports).
14.
Medium-term growth prospects are mainly driven by a projected (albeit delayed)
increase in oil output in the Kashagan oil field. Growth is expected to average around
5½ percent over the medium term. Production in Kashagan started in September 2013, but it was
halted in early October after the discovery of gas leaks in the pipeline network, delaying the
expansion in production by two years.
15.
Risks to the outlook are predominantly on the downside (Appendix I). Weaker
confidence following the devaluation poses downside domestic risks to growth in 2014.
Furthermore, Kazakhstan is vulnerable to a prolonged slowdown in emerging markets and
additional unfavorable developments in Russia and Ukraine, given the strong linkages with Russia
(especially in the context the Custom’s Union) and potential spillovers to Europe through gas
exports from Russia (Box 2). The authorities agreed with staff’s assessment of risks, and noted that
oil-fund resources, as in the past, could be used to support the economy in the event of an
additional large negative shock to growth.

Box 2. Kazakhstan: Economic Implications of the Russia-Ukraine Tensions
The impact of Russia-Ukraine tensions has so far been
limited. While the tensions may have contributed to
weaker investor sentiments and pressures on the tenge,
financial and risk indicators’ traditionally close links with
those in Russia (largely reflecting common external
factors) have weakened. Moreover, Fitch reaffirmed
Kazakhstan’s rating at BBB+ with a stable outlook on May
9, while S&P had downgraded Russia two weeks earlier.

the range of 0.1–0.2 percentage points. However, the tensions could have much more serious implications in
case of spillovers to activity in Europe through disruptions in gas exports via Ukraine. Other potential indirect
effects include, on the negative side, lower global growth and increased risk premium, and, on the positive
side, higher oil and grain prices. Finally, in the financial sector, the three Russian-owned banks—Sberbank, Alfa,
and VTB—account for about 9 percent of Kazakhstan’s banking system assets and further sanctions could
impact their activities in Kazakhstan.

POLICY DISCUSSIONS
16.
Policy discussions centered on the short-term policy stance—including restoring
confidence and stability—and on progress in improving policy frameworks. In the short run,
staff’s assessment is that slower growth in 2014 warrants the authorities’ somewhat
looser-than-originally-planned fiscal stance. Monetary policy, on the other hand, may need to be
tightened should inflationary expectations become unanchored. At the same time, to further
enhance the policy architecture, staff has underscored the need for (i) a decisive follow-through on
dealing with the NPL problem; (ii) strengthened monetary policy framework and gradual transition
to greater exchange rate flexibility; (iii) improved medium-term planning of fiscal and quasi-fiscal
activities; and (iv) a transparent and market-based reform and diversification strategy to help
promote more inclusive growth. The authorities agreed with staff on the proposed short-term policy
mix and broadly shared staff’s view on the need to bolster the macroeconomic policy frameworks.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

REPUBLIC OF KAZAKHSTAN

A. Financial Sector Issues
17.
The authorities are taking more aggressive steps to reduce the large stock of NPLs.
Staff saw the commitment to ensure that banks adhere to the NPL ceilings (15 percent by end–2014
and 10 percent by end–2015) as appropriately ambitious. It highlighted the importance of enforcing
the NPL ceilings through credible supervisory actions, while ensuring adequate provisions. To
facilitate the achievement of these targets, the authorities are buttressing existing policy vehicles
and introducing an appropriate mix of incentives and penalties. The plan to substantially increase
the financing of PLF—tenfold to 250 billion tenge (about US$1.4 billion)—is expected to be
accompanied by expanding the eligibility of loans (especially real estate and construction) that can
be purchased by the PLF and by granting special powers to the PLF. Moreover, the authorities
recognize the need for expediting the parliamentary approval of their proposed legislative
amendments concerning tax incentives for debt write-offs and the removal of legal obstacles to the
transfer of NPLs into Special Purpose Vehicles (SPVs) or the PLF. Finally, the authorities are expected
to revise the insolvency law to strengthen protection for legal rights of secured creditors.
The authorities expressed commitment to fully implement the recommendations of
18.
the Financial Sector Assessment Program (FSAP). Key priority areas, in addition to the single
pension fund, insurance and securities market oversight, and financial infrastructure, include
(Appendix II):


The divestiture of nationalized banks. Given the systemic implications of the sale of BTA to
Kazkommertsbank―with the combined entity accounting for about 25 percent of banking
system assets and over 65 percent of all NPLs―the authorities shared staff’s assessment on
the need to carry out an asset quality review (AQR), preferably by an independent
international entity and prior to the completion of the transaction. Staff also recommended
that a time-bound plan for working out those NPLs is prepared as part of the deal and that
the implementation of this plan is carefully monitored.



Bolstering the financial safety net and moving to risk-based oversight. In staff’s view, available
resolution tools, as foreseen in current legislation, are impractical and should be amended.
In particular, supervisors should have full authority to independently mandate the resolution
methods (currently depositors and other creditors have a say in the resolution method) and
have a clearly sequenced procedure for graduated intervention. A faster transition from
granular compliance supervision towards more risk-based oversight is also needed.



The sharp further increase in financial dollarization following the devaluation. The authorities
shared staff’s view that the prevalence of dollarization renders the financial system
increasingly prone to foreign currency risks. Dollarization is also likely to put upward
pressure on NPLs in the coming months, requiring vigilance to the emergence of related
credit risk.

19.
Staff welcomed the recent deployment of macroprudential measures aimed at halting
the rapid growth in consumer lending. With a view to minimizing risks associated with rapid
growth in consumer lending (46 percent in 2013), the NBK recently adopted the following measures:

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

11

REPUBLIC OF KAZAKHSTAN

(i) a 50 percent cap applied to the debt-to-income ratio; (ii) an increase in capital adequacy
requirements on unsecured consumer loans to 100 percent (from 75 percent); and (iii) a 30 percent
ceiling on the growth in consumer loans for each bank. In line with the FSAP recommendations, the
authorities plan to monitor closely the impact of the regulations and stand ready to make necessary
adjustments.
20.
The governance structure of the unified pension fund (UAPF) may be prone to conflict
of interest, requiring effective checks and controls. Under the recently unified structure, the NBK
chairs both the board of the UAPF and the Council for the Management of Assets (CMA) that
governs the investment policy. Moreover, the NBK is the statutory asset manager, the custodian, and
the supervisor of banks. The authorities are mindful of staff’s concerns regarding potential conflict of
interest and the importance of separating ownership from control functions, and are committed to
full transparency and accountability, including by the CMA, to ensure that the investment policy is
free from undue interference.

B. Monetary Policy
21.
Staff considered that, given the expected rise in inflation, the authorities should stand
ready to tighten monetary policy, if necessary. In view of the importance of anchoring inflation
expectations, and with the aim of more effectively signaling a possible tighter stance of monetary
policy, staff advised the authorities to speed up the planned introduction of a new policy interest
rate instrument. Staff cautioned that NBK’s announced foreign-currency swap operations with banks
aimed at alleviating the scarcity of long-term tenge liquidity should be seen as a temporary
alternative to standard open market operations. Staff also noted that price controls should not be
deployed as a policy tool given the damage they could do to the investment climate (and at a time
when Kazakhstan is trying to diversify it economy). While agreeing on the need to stand ready to
tighten monetary policy (which effectively involves tightening liquidity directly), the authorities did
not expect to launch the new policy interest rate instrument this year.
22.
The authorities and staff agreed that faster progress in developing a more effective
monetary policy framework is paramount. Rising dollarization signals underlying lack of
credibility in the current regime. Against this background, and in view of the authorities’ stated goal
of adopting inflation targeting over the medium term, staff advised the authorities to begin taking
steps to enhance the monetary policy framework. In the near term, the key steps include:


Introducing a new policy interest rate supported by open market operations. The continued
volatility in the money market underscores the urgent need to make more rapid progress in this
area. In staff’s assessment, the NBK’s tight exchange rate management, and its recent refocusing
on the exchange rate both as primary objective and as dominant instrument of monetary policy,
complicates the management of system liquidity (Box 3 and forthcoming IMF Working Paper
14/108 “Monetary Policy in Hybrid Regimes: The Case of Kazakhstan”).



Gradually widening the exchange rate band. This would give more room for interest rate policy,
and would also help correct any small exchange rate undervaluation with less pressure on
inflation and reserves.

12



Improving communication, including by publishing the monetary policy guidelines for 2014.

Later on, additional considerations could be given to strengthening inflation forecasting models and
governance issues, for example, creating a standard monetary policy committee (see the
accompanied Selected Issues Paper entitled “Toward Inflation Targeting in Kazakhstan”). In support
of strengthening the monetary policy framework, the authorities have requested IMF technical
assistance, which would identify the appropriate timeline for implementation of these steps.
Box 3. Kazakhstan: Liquidity Management and the Role of Monetary and Exchange Rate Policy
The de jure primary goal of NBK’s monetary policy is price stability; however, de facto, a tightly
managed exchange rate guides the management of system liquidity. The NBK’s monetary policy
guidelines are explicit about the primacy of the price-stability objective, with the view of promoting financial
sector stability. In practice, however, the driving force behind the management of tenge liquidity, and in turn
the conduct of monetary policy, is the tightly managed tenge/USD exchange rate and the frequency in which
the NBK intervenes in the foreign exchange market.

September 2013, the NBK switched to the use of a
multi-currency basket (with weights of 70, 20, and 10 percent for the USD, euro, and ruble, respectively) in
smoothing “excessive” exchange rate fluctuations. However, in February 2014, the NBK unexpectedly devalued
the tenge (by 18 percent), to a level of 185, and reestablished a tight new corridor of +/- 3 tenge (roughly

During 2010–12, key money market interest rates hovered
around the deposit rate (close to zero), indicating excess system liquidity. However, since 2012, interbank rates
have drifted higher amid tightening of tenge liquidity conditions. In particular, over the past six months, in part
due to sustained speculations of tenge devaluation, key interbank rates rose significantly, temporarily
exceeding the refinancing rate by a large margin.

C. Fiscal Policy
23.
In view of slower growth and the availability of large buffers, staff supported a small
fall in the overall surplus and a temporary deviation of the non-oil deficit from a declining
trend. The overall balance is expected to narrow to 4.3 percent of GDP in 2014, from 5.2 percent of
GDP in 2013. However, in cyclically adjusted terms, and excluding one-off spending on capitalization
of the PLF,6 it will be roughly unchanged from last year at 4.9 percent of GDP. The non-oil deficit is
expected to increase sharply to about 9 percent of GDP in 2014, virtually undoing the impressive
adjustment last year. With some of the spending to be conducted through quasi-fiscal institutions,
staff urged the authorities to ensure the high quality and transparency of spending. Furthermore,
the authorities indicated that they remain committed to their goal of reducing the non-oil deficit of
the unconsolidated budget (not accounting for NFRK) to 2.8 percent of GDP by 2020.7 While the
authorities have yet to finalize the details of their medium-term fiscal plans, according to staff
calculations and assuming unchanged policies, staff’s estimated sustainable level of the non-oil
deficit of 6 percent would be achieved before 2018. Gross public debt is expected to stay at low
levels (Appendix III), although contingent liabilities will need to be monitored carefully.
24.
Staff underscored that strengthening the fiscal policy framework remains a priority.
Despite important steps outlined in the authorities’ fiscal strategy adopted last year, there is ample
scope for further progress, especially in extending the coverage of the fiscal framework (Box 4) and
in improving its integration within the broader macroeconomic policy framework. In particular,
staff’s advice focused on: (i) consolidating NFRK within the authorities’ fiscal accounts and using the
non-oil deficit of the consolidated budget as an anchor for fiscal policy; (ii) reducing the scope of
extra budgetary activity and properly accounting for contingent liabilities; (iii) improving revenue
policies, including by minimizing ad hoc changes in export duties and relying more on income,
progressive, and resource-rent taxation; and (iv) replacing administrative price controls with
targeted measures to protect socially vulnerable groups (see the accompanying Selected Issues
Paper entitled “Assessment of Inclusive Growth”). The authorities broadly shared staff’s views but
pointed to recent improvements, including the expected introduction of public audit system in the
current year and Kazakhstan’s recent progress in the Open Budget Index.8 In this context staff
welcomed the authorities’ cooperation with the World Bank in the area of introducing results-based
budgeting. In addition, an IMF technical assistance mission in June 2014 is expected to advise the
authorities on further improving public sector accounting and design of a risk management
approach for budget planning.

6

The capitalization of the PLF, which is about 0.6 percent of GDP and is planned towards the end of 2014, is
expected to have only an indirect impact on growth through enabling the PLF to buy more NPLs and therefore
contribute to credit growth.
7

Based on staff calculations and assuming unchanged policies, this target is equivalent to the non-oil deficit of the
consolidated budget of about 4.5 percent of GDP.

25.
Staff stressed that continued prudent and transparent management of oil wealth is
essential. Kazakhstan compares well with many other oil exporters in the transparency of operations
of the national oil fund, which has dual objectives of stabilization and intergenerational equity. Staff
urged the authorities to maintain the transparency, especially in the context of renewed initiatives to
use NFRK for the government’s diversification and industrialization plans. In particular, the
announced US$5.4 billion package from NFRK needs to be appropriately aligned with the principles
of efficient and sustainable management of its assets. To the extent possible, all spending out of
NFRK should be channeled through the budget. Lending programs through quasi-fiscal institutions
and commercial banks warrant careful planning and implementation. In particular, staff (based on
the results of its earlier analytical work)9 argued that public spending, while taking into account the
positive impact on growth, should remain prudent to avoid Dutch disease problems. Furthermore, it
will be important to ensure that development and diversification programs are transparent,
cost-efficient, and in line with capacity. In this context, staff welcomed the authorities’ plans to
cooperate with MDBs in choosing projects to be financed from oil savings.

Box 4. Kazakhstan: Improving Fiscal Coverage
Accurate fiscal coverage is critical for the soundness of fiscal analysis and fiscal policy formulation.
According to the GFS 2001 manual the general government sector encompasses all government units and all
nonmarket nonprofit institutions that are controlled and mainly financed by the government units. In practice,
since ensuring comprehensive fiscal coverage is costly, countries should prioritize expanding the coverage in
areas that have the most policy significance.
In Kazakhstan, as in many other countries, official statistics excludes important parts of the public
sector. Government fiscal accounts in Kazakhstan include central and local government operations but leave
out extra-budgetary funds (including NFRK) and the operations of the SOE sector. At the same time, the
authorities are mindful of the need to monitor closely some operations of the quasifiscal sector. In this regard,
two important recent policy developments were the introduction of monitoring mechanisms and ceilings for
external debt of the broader public sector, and the creation of Baiterek (government’s development holding
with total assets of about 6 percent of GDP), with the purpose of separating the quasifiscal and commercial
operations of the SOE sector. Despite these improvements, expanding the fiscal coverage is essential for a fully
informed conduct of fiscal policy.

wasted.

The authorities’ accounting of the recent stimulus package in fiscal accounts highlights the deficiencies
of limited fiscal coverage. Unlike staff calculations, the authorities’ fiscal accounts do not fully reflect the
package which renders them uninformative of the true fiscal policy stance. This omission includes the implicit
subsidies involved in lending: for the current year, Baiterek has already issued a 100 billion tenge bond to
NFRK with 0.1 percent annual rate and 20 year maturity and will in turn lend to banks at annual rate of
2 percent, while the interest rate for final borrowers (SMEs) will be set at 6 percent. The costs associated with
this lending are not reflected in the government’s fiscal accounts.

D. Structural Policies
26.
Kazakhstan’s economic growth has been broadly inclusive, but further efforts,
especially in employment creation, are needed to reduce growing income gaps. Both income
inequality and unemployment in Kazakhstan compare favorably to peers. That said, the recent
efforts to further reduce income inequality by promoting faster employment growth have been
relatively weak. Furthermore, despite some progress, poverty rates in rural areas are higher than
some poorer regional peers. The unemployment rate has declined rapidly since 2000, but around
30 percent of the work force remains vulnerable (being, for example, self-employed or unpaid family
worker). Productivity growth in the oil extracting regions was fueled by large capital investments,
while employment creation was limited. Also the relationship between job creation and growth has
been weak, particularly since the onset of the global crisis. Staff noted that deepening structural
policies aimed at improving the functioning of the labor market would be crucial to fostering the
development of labor-intensive sectors that do not depend on extractive industries (see the
accompanying Selected Issues Paper entitled “Assessment of Inclusive Growth”).
27.
Staff welcomed efforts to speed up reforms, a prerequisite for Kazakhstan to become
a dynamic emerging market economy (see also IMF’s Middle East and Central Asia Departmental
Paper 14/2 “The Caucasus and Central Asia: Transitioning to Emerging Markets”).10 In particular, staff
stressed the need to bolster human capital and institutions and lower the role of the state in the
economy. Successful diversification, which is the authorities’ main long-term goal, requires
addressing key structural weaknesses, namely human capital and institutions—areas where
Kazakhstan lags behind successful emerging market economies (Figure 7). To promote
private-sector led non-oil growth and job creation, the government’s long-term development
programs (as envisaged in the government’s Kazakhstan 2050 Vision document) will need to focus
on broad-based reforms, while avoiding top-down policies of picking winners. Staff welcomed the
authorities’ recent efforts to accelerate structural reforms in close cooperation with the World Bank,
EBRD, ADB and other development institutions, including by promoting private sector activity and
the development of the non-oil sector. Notably, faster progress is needed in addressing skill
mismatches, starting business, enforcing contracts, and protecting investors. The authorities broadly
shared this assessment. Moreover, in the context of gradually reducing the role of the state in the
economy, the authorities plan to accelerate the public IPO program of large SOEs.

STAFF APPRAISAL
28.
Amid uncertain external and domestic environments, policy measures should aim at
mitigating shocks and achieving medium-term goals. Growth has been solid in recent years.
However, the economy is slowing down this year and the outlook for growth is subject to downside
risks, principally a prolonged slowdown in emerging markets and further unfavorable developments
in Russia and Ukraine. To buttress the economy’s capacity to withstand shocks and achieve
10

http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/cat/longres.aspx?sk=41448.0

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

17

REPUBLIC OF KAZAKHSTAN

sustainable growth, the authorities should further bolster the macroeconomic policy frameworks
and speed up the implementation of structural reforms.
29.
Steadfast implementation of the FSAP recommendations requires further concerted
efforts. The recent more aggressive action taken by the NBK to reduce the large stock of NPLs is
welcome. Similar efforts should be extended to other FSAP recommendations. In particular, the NBK
should ensure that strengthening existing resolution measures together with appropriate corrective
supervisory actions enforce the NPL ceilings effectively. Moreover, given systemic implications, the
authorities should facilitate an asset quality review by an independent international entity of
Kazkommertsbank and BTA prior to the completion of their merger. Additional priorities include
bolstering risk-based supervisory functions and closely monitoring the emergence of foreign
currency risks due to higher dollarization.
30.
The authorities should stand ready to tighten monetary policy, if necessary, while
bolstering the interest rate policy lever and operations. With the view to ensuring that
inflationary expectations are well anchored, and with the aim of more effectively signaling a possible
tighter stance of monetary policy, the authorities should speed up the planned introduction of a
new policy interest rate instrument, supported by active open market operations. As a complement
to more effective interest rate policy, and as an intermediary step toward a more flexible exchange
rate regime, the authorities should aim to widen the exchange rate band over time. Moreover, to
anchor expectations about policy intentions and operations, it will be important to communicate
more openly and clearly the transition plans, including publishing the monetary policy guidelines for
2014 as soon as possible.
31.
In light of slowing growth, the near-term fiscal policy stance is appropriate, but
strengthening the fiscal policy framework remains a priority. Care needs to be taken to ensure
that overall spending increases, including recapitalizing the PLF and on-lending via Baiterek and
commercial banks to support SMEs and priority sectors, are transparent and of high quality. At the
same time, it is critical that the authorities remain committed to the non-oil deficit target of
6 percent of GDP by 2018. In addition, despite important steps outlined in the authorities’ fiscal
strategy adopted last year, there is ample scope for further progress, especially in extending the
coverage of the fiscal framework and improving its integration within the broader macroeconomic
policy framework. To better assess the fiscal policy stance, the authorities should consolidate NFRK
into fiscal accounts, and reduce off-budget expenditure. Further, it is important that both annual
and medium-term fiscal plans are well-integrated into broader macro policy objectives.
32.
An ambitious structural reform agenda is paramount to Kazakhstan becoming a
dynamic emerging market economy and ensuring sustainable and inclusive growth. Key
priority areas include strengthening human capital and institutions and lowering the role of the state
in a more diversified economy. Moreover, to promote private-sector led non-oil growth and job
creation, the authorities’ recent efforts to accelerate reforms in close cooperation with the
international financial institutions are crucial to building up confidence and attracting foreign
investment into the non-extractive sectors. Specific areas where more rapid progress is needed are

Appendix I. Kazakhstan: Risk Assessment Matrix11
Nature/source of
main threats

Likelihood of realization in
the next three years

Expected impact on the
economy if risk is realized

Recommended
policy response

Sustained decline in
commodity prices.

Staff assessment: Medium

Staff assessment: High

Decline in oil prices may be
triggered by deceleration of
global demand and
coming-on stream of excess
capacity in the medium term.

Growth would decelerate
noticeably, mainly due to
reduced oil exports and a
fall in oil-related capital
flows. The tenge could
come under sustained
downward pressure.

Transparent and
high quality fiscal
response (with
spending
priorities
determined in a
temporary and
targeted way) to
arrest significant
deceleration of
growth.

Staff assessment: Medium

Staff assessment:
Medium

Kazakhstan’s economy
remains highly
dependent on oil for
export and budget
revenues.

Protracted period of
slower growth in
emerging economies.
Russia and China are
key trading partners,
accounting for about
30 percent of
Kazakhstan’s exports.
Market risk indicators
tend to move in line
with those of Russia.
China is a major
source of investment.
Increasing
geopolitical tensions
surrounding
Russia/Ukraine.
Kazakhstan is
vulnerable due to
strong trade and
financial linkages with
Russia and to some
degree with Ukraine.

Latest Fund staff’s projections
suggest that trend growth in
emerging economies is lower
as a result of weaker than
expected productive capacity
and human capital.

Staff assessment: Medium
Growth in Russia may fall on
account of shaken investor
confidence, tighter financing
conditions and possible
sanctions.

Kazakhstan’s growth would
be affected adversely
through trade (lower
external demand), finance,
and investment channels.

Staff assessment:
Medium
Kazakhstan would be
affected through lower
export demand and
investment flows from
Russia. Political uncertainty
may increase, with
downward pressure on the
tenge.

Transparent and
high quality fiscal
response (with
spending
priorities
determined in a

The Risk Assessment Matrix (RAM) shows events that could materially alter the baseline path (the scenario most
likely to materialize in the view of IMF staff). The relative likelihood of risks listed is the staff’s subjective assessment
of the risks surrounding the baseline (“low” is meant to indicate a probability below 10 percent, “medium” a
probability between 10 and 30 percent, and “high” a probability of 30 percent or more). The RAM reflects staff views
on the source of risks and overall level of concern as of the time of discussions with the authorities. Non-mutually
exclusive risks may interact and materialize jointly.

Nature/source of

Likelihood of realization in
the next three years

Expected impact on the
economy if risk is realized

Recommended
policy response

Domestic confidence.

Staff assessment: Medium

Lack of progress in
resolving the
long-standing NPL
problem and in
improving the
monetary and
exchange rate policy
framework would
weaken confidence.

Triggers may include:
(i) slower-than-expected
implementation of the NPL
resolution framework; and
(ii) possible further tenge
devaluation.

Staff assessment:
Medium

Monetary
tightening to
contain rising
inflation and
strengthening of
macro policy
frameworks to
restore
confidence.

Delays or reversals in
structural reforms.

Staff assessment: Medium

Increasing the role of
the state in economic
activity may negatively
affect Kazakhstan’s
prospects of
becoming a dynamic
emerging market
economy.

34

The government’s
industrialization and
diversification policy agenda
focuses heavily on top-down
industrialization, while
progress on broad-based
institutional reforms remains
slow.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

Renewed concerns about
financial stability may lead
to pressure on bank
deposits. Financial sector
stress could also lead to a
credit crunch. Uncertainty
about policy action and
effectiveness would
negatively affect
investment.
Staff assessment:
Medium
Inefficient and
nontransparent public
spending may lead to
waste of public wealth and
eventually lead to lower
long-term growth.

Focus on
broad-based
structural reforms
to boost human
capital and
institutions.
Ensure political
commitment to
the reform
process and high
standards of
efficiency in all
public spending.

Exchange rate arrangements
The currency of Kazakhstan is the tenge, which was introduced in November 1993. The official
exchange rate is determined on the basis of foreign exchange auctions that are held daily. Auctions
are held for U.S. dollars, euros, and Russian rubles, and official rates are quoted for over 30 other
currencies on the basis of cross-rates. From late 1999 to October 2007, the exchange rate regime
was a managed float with no preannounced path. From October 2007 the tenge was maintained
within a narrow range against the U.S. dollar. In February 2009, the tenge was devalued by
18 percent against the US dollar, and a trading band of T150/USD +/- 3 percent was established. In
February 2010, the trading band was widened and set at an asymmetric T150/USD +10/-15 percent.
In February 2011, the trading band was officially abolished, and the de jure exchange rate
arrangement was changed from a pegged exchange rate within horizontal bands to a managed
float. Between September 2013 and February 2014, the tenge was managed within an unofficial
2 percent band against a basket of currencies comprised of the U.S. dollar (70 percent), the euro
(20 percent), and the Russian ruble (10 percent). Since February 2014 (following an 18 percent
devaluation against the U.S. dollar), the tenge has stabilized within a trading band of
T185/USD +/- 3 tenge/USD. The de facto exchange rate has been reclassified from a crawl-like to a
stabilized arrangement, effective February 11, 2014. The NBK may conduct foreign exchange
operations both on the regulated Kazakhstan Stock Exchange (KASE) and in the interbank foreign
exchange markets. The NBK intervenes on its own behalf directly with market participants based on
their quotes and does not publish information on its interventions. The exchange system is free from
restrictions on payments and transfers for current international transactions.
Article IV Consultation
Kazakhstan is on the standard 12-month consultation cycle, in accordance with the Decision on
Article IV Consultation Cycles (Decision No. 14747–(10/96) (9/28/2010). The last consultation was
concluded on August 2, 2013 (see IMF Country Report No. 13/290).
FSAP participation and ROSCS
Kazakhstan participated in the Financial Sector Assessment Program (FSAP) in 2000. The staff report
on the Financial Sector Stability Assessment (FSSA) was issued on November 27, 2000
(FO/DIS/00/142). The FSSA included the following ROSC modules: Basel Core Principles for Effective
Banking Supervision, Core Principles for Systemically Important Payment Systems, Code of Good
Practices on Transparency in Monetary and Financial Policies, IOSCO Objectives and Principles of
Securities Regulation, and IAIS Insurance Core Principles. FSAP Updates were conducted in February
2004, March 2008, and February 2014. The fiscal transparency module was completed in October
2002 and the final report published in April 2003. A data module mission took place in April/May
2002, and its final report was published in March 2003. An update of the data ROSC was undertaken
in 2006 and the report was published in February 2008 (IMF Country Report No. 08/56, Annex V).

AML/CFT assessment
Kazakhstan’s anti-money laundering and combating the financing of terrorism (AML/CFT)
framework was recently assessed against the AML/CFT standard, the Financial Action Task Force
(FATF) 40+9 Recommendations. The evaluation was conducted by the Eurasian Group on money
laundering and financing of terrorism (EAG), the FATF-style regional body of which Kazakhstan is a
member, and the final mutual evaluation report was adopted in June 2011. The report indicates that
the main sources of criminal proceeds in Kazakhstan are crimes related to fraud and abuse of public
office. The evaluators found that Kazakhstan had a relatively comprehensive AML/CFT framework in
place, but that significant deficiencies nevertheless remained, notably with respect to customer due
diligence measures and the reporting of suspicious transactions. Kazakhstan is tentatively scheduled
to undergo its next AML/CFT assessment by the EAG in April 2017.
Technical Assistance
Kazakhstan has received technical assistance and training by the Fund in virtually every area of
economic policy, including through over 90 technical assistance missions provided during
1993–2014 by FAD, LEG, MCM, STA, and the IMF Institute. In addition to short-term missions, the
Fund has provided resident advisors to the National Bank of Kazakhstan, to the Agency of Statistics
of the Republic of Kazakhstan, to the ministry of finance, and a peripatetic expert to the Financial
Supervision Agency. Other international agencies and governments, including the World Bank, EU
TACIS, EBRD, UNDP, and OECD, also are providing a wide variety of technical assistance. The
following list summarizes the technical assistance provided by the Fund to Kazakhstan since 2003.
Monetary and Capital Markets Department
Technical assistance has enabled steady progress in a number of areas related to monetary and
exchange affairs, including banking legislation, central bank accounting, payments system reform,
central bank organization and management, foreign operations and reserve management, banking
supervision, monetary statistics, currency issuance, monetary operations, and money-market
development.

RELATIONS WITH THE WORLD BANK
(As of May 15, 2014)
Kazakhstan became a member of the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD)
and the International Development Association (IDA) in July 1992 and a member of the International
Finance Corporation (IFC) in September 1993. In 2010 Kazakhstan became an IDA donor under the
IDA16 replenishment. Kazakhstan is the largest client of the IFC in Central Asia.
IBRD in Kazakhstan
The Bank’s lending operations in Kazakhstan are aligned with the Country Partnership Strategy (CPS)
for FY12–17, endorsed by the Board in May 2012. As of May 2014, the IBRD loan program comprised
thirteen projects with a total commitment of US$3.7 billion, of which US$1.8 billion has been
disbursed. While 90 percent of the commitments are concentrated in the on-going South-West
roads project and the East-West roads project, the portfolio remains diverse with two-thirds of the
projects focused on institutional building. The other eleven projects are: forest protection and
reforestation, technology commercialization, customs development, tax administration reform,
health sector technology transfer and institutional reform, technical and vocational education
modernization, statistical capacity building, Ust-Kamenogorsk environmental remediation, Alma
electricity transmission, second irrigation and drainage (signed in April 2014), and justice sector
institutional strengthening (signed in April 2014) .
The Bank also provides extensive advisory and analytical services (AAA) to the Government through
the Joint Economic Research Program (JERP). The JERP is instrumental in providing policy analysis,
strategic planning expertise, and good practice options to assist the Government with the reform
agenda in the field of economic and social development and the institutional capacity of the
Government to conduct economic and sectoral work. The JERP for FY14 amounted to over
US$4.5 million and comprised 26 largely interrelated and programmatic activities focusing on the
Government’s strategic priorities in competitiveness agenda (including counter-cyclical
macroeconomic policy options, trade integration, investment climate improvement, management of
innovations, and insolvency regime); public finance management and public services (including
introduction of the result oriented budget, tax policy improvement, and reforming of housing and
communal services); social modernization (including development of the framework for better
human capital outcomes, improvement of social safety network, and bringing the quality education
to international standards); and sustainable development (improving industrial competitiveness for
greener production and disaster risk management).
IFC in Kazakhstan
In the context of the CPS for FY12–17, IFC’s role is to contribute to the government's development
plans by supporting the private sector to advance economic diversification and growth agenda,
particularly in the non-extractive sectors and frontier regions. In the short term IFC is focusing on
strengthening the financial sector, both in the context of the post-crisis recovery and as a
prerequisite to pursue the diversification agenda, and infrastructure development, including through
6

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

REPUBLIC OF KAZAKHSTAN

Public Private Partnerships (PPPs). In the medium term more efforts will be dedicated to the
establishment of best practices in international banking, improvement of the corporate governance
and the regulatory environment, SMEs development, increasing investments in value-added
manufacturing, agribusiness and services, and supporting the energy efficiency.
IFC’s investment program has been expanding in the context of the crisis response. It grew tenfold
between FY05 and FY08 (to US$110 million) and nearly doubled again in FY09. In FY10, IFC invested
a record US$336 million in five projects in the financial and agribusiness sectors, with vast majority
provided to commercial banks. Post-crisis IFC’s investment level has moderated and averaged at
about US$100 million per year in FY11–13. As of May 2014, Kazakhstan remains IFC's largest client in
Central Asia with total committed portfolio of US$246 million, of which US$245 million is
outstanding. The investment portfolio is mostly concentrated in the financial sector, infrastructure,
general manufacturing and consumer services, although IFC has begun making investments in the
agribusiness sector as well.

RELATIONS WITH THE EUROPEAN BANK FOR
RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVELOPMENT
(As of July 5, 2013)
The European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) is the largest investor outside the
oil and gas sector in Kazakhstan and in 2013 will celebrate its twentieth anniversary in the country.
As of 30 June 2013, the EBRD’s total investments in Kazakhstan, including co-financing, stood at
€12 billion, with the Bank’s own share totaling €4.8 billion (both these figures include approximately
€1.3 billion in cumulative Trade Facilitation Program turnover). As of 30 June 2013, the EBRD’s
portfolio in Kazakhstan amounted to €1.9 billion. During 2012, the EBRD signed 18 projects,
including regional ones, for a total amount of EBRD finance €374 million. During the first half of
2013, the EBRD signed seven operations with a total annual bank investment of €155 million.
In its country strategy, approved in 2010, the EBRD aims to assist Kazakhstan in promoting
economic diversification and moving towards a more sustainable model of financial development.
The EBRD’s main operational objectives for 2013 are:


In the corporate sector, support investment in the manufacturing and the agribusiness sectors
to address immediate financing needs, while promoting the modernization and diversification of
the economy, best business and environmental practices, and energy efficiency.



In the financial sector, work with the Kazakhstani authorities and other IFIs to strengthen the
country’s financial sector; re-engage with partner banks; expand the partner banks group; and
assist the authorities with resolving the banks’ NPL problem and identifying and implementing
policy reforms to promote de-dollarization, develop local capital markets, and increase the
availability of sustainable local currency financing.



In the infrastructure sector, restructure the national railway company and support its
energy-efficiency improvement program; improve the infrastructure in Kazakh municipalities;
expand activities into the solid waste and district heating sectors and support municipal sector
reform, including innovative methods for developing and financing projects in the water
segment.



In the power and energy sector, support clean energy through the provision of financing to
modern generating facilities, stemming losses in the distribution segment through rehabilitation
of power lines and developing pilot renewable energy projects with private operators (subject to
bankability and integrity).

RELATIONS WITH THE ASIAN DEVELOPMENT BANK
(As of 20 May 2014)
Kazakhstan became a member of the Asian Development Bank (ADB) in 1994. In the early years of
transition from a centrally planned to a more market-driven economy, ADB focused on efforts to
sustain a higher growth rate, promote environmental friendly development, support the private
sector, and encourage regional integration.
As of 15 May 2014, cumulative public sector loan commitments to Kazakhstan amounted to almost
US$3 billion, of which about US$1.8 billion has been disbursed. Commitments cover 25 public sector
loan operations in agriculture and natural resources, education, finance, transport and
communications, water supply and sanitation, irrigation, and small and medium-sized enterprises
(SMEs). These loans were complemented with 68 technical assistance (TA) projects amounting to
about US$31.1 million. Kazakhstan is eligible for the ordinary capital resources (OCR) only.
Kazakhstan became a donor to the Asian Development Fund, ADB’s concessional financing resource,
with a US$5.49 million contribution in 2012.
ADB’s current country partnership strategy (CPS) to guide operations during 2012–16 aims to
support economic diversification and increased competitiveness. The CPS envisages to support
regional cooperation, private sector development and operations, inclusive growth, and knowledge
solutions. ADB’s focus is in the transport, finance, urban, and energy sectors. As knowledge solutions
are central to the new CPS, the government and ADB established a joint Knowledge and Experience
Exchange Program (KEEP) in 2013. The KEEP commits the parties to a 50 percent cost-sharing
arrangement with a total financing of US$2.5 million from 2013–15.
In the transport sector, ADB has been supporting Kazakhstan in realizing its transit potential and
integration into the global transport network via two multitranche financing facilities (MFFs) totaling
US$1.5 billion to improve road networks in two regions of Kazakhstan (Zhambyl and Mangystau),
along the CAREC Transport Corridors 1 and 2. Six projects are under implementation with some
sections completed and in use. Once fully completed, the projects will contribute to increased
external trade and economic development. In 2010, ADB approved a US$500 million MFF for the
SME Investment Program to enhance efficiency and competitiveness of the financial sector and
SMEs. Tranche 1 in the amount of US$150 million was provided to the DAMU Entrepreneurship
Development Fund for onlending to three participating financial institutions (PFIs), and was fully
disbursed in April 2013. A subsequent tranche 2 amounting to US$150 million was approved in
December 2013. Currency and interest rate risks are mitigated through local currency-denominated,
fixed-rate loans.
In the energy sector, ADB is focusing on energy efficiency, and providing technical assistance on
modernization of district heating networks and on institutional capacity development.
Knowledge partnerships were established through two major studies (one on Kazakhstan’s industrial
policy, and the other on knowledge-based economy) to promote a constructive dialogue among
10

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND

REPUBLIC OF KAZAKHSTAN

high-level policy makers and share lessons and best practices of other developing member
countries and advanced economies, with the aim of exploring appropriate future policy options and
to improve planning strategies. At the sector level, advisory support is being provided for financing
urban infrastructure in secondary cities.
Private sector operations of ADB in Kazakhstan began in 2006, with private sector financing to six
entities in the financial and agribusiness sectors amounting to US$455.2 million approved to-date.
Near-term ADB private sector financing prospects are in private infrastructure and energy sectors.
Kazakhstan was one of the four founding partners of the CAREC Program in 1997 (together with the
People’s Republic of China, the Kyrgyz Republic, and Uzbekistan). Since then, six other countries
have joined the partnership, and CAREC-related investments in the partner countries have totaled
US$22.4 billion, over the period 2001–13. Four of the six CAREC road and rail corridors traverse
Kazakhstan, and developing these Central Asian corridors is a priority for achieving CAREC’s goal of
land bridges connecting Europe and Asia. In October 2013, Kazakhstan hosted the twelfth CAREC
Ministerial Conference in Astana which brought together the ministers of the 10 member countries
to discuss the progress of CAREC. In May 2014, Kazakhstan hosted the ADB Annual Meeting of the
Board of Governors. About 3,000 participants attended the event and discussed connectivity,
innovation, and the need to keep up with the demands of a changing Asia and Pacific.

STATISTICAL ISSUES
(As of May 27, 2014)
I. Assessment of Data Adequacy for Surveillance
General: Data provision has some shortcomings, but is broadly adequate for surveillance. The most
affected areas are balance of payments statistics, monetary statistics, and coverage of fiscal statistics
as well as national accounts.
Real Sector: The quality of GDP statistics is affected by the limited coverage of small businesses in
selected activities such as retail and construction. Some progress has been made in compiling and
reporting GDP by final expenditure consistent with output-based measures. The quality of consumer
price statistics is affected by occasional use of administrative price controls. Typically, for each good
or service administrative controls are imposed on the variety that is included in the CPI basket.
Since producers/importers are not compensated by the government for any losses due to the
price controls, they may switch to noncontrolled varieties and/or compensate by increasing the
prices of non-controlled varieties.
Government finance statistics: Progress has been made in the classification of the fiscal accounts
consistent with the Fund’s Government Finance Statistics Manual 2001 (GFSM 2001). However,
statistics on the enlarged government (including public enterprises) is not available.
Monetary statistics: The monetary statistics based on the Standardized Report Forms (SRFs)
complied by the central bank have had a few inconsistencies.
Balance of payments: The authorities have transitioned to the compilation of balance of payments in
concordance with the sixth edition of Balance of Payments Statistics Manual (BPM6) starting 2013.
Deficiencies remain in foreign direct investment statistics as local branch offices of foreign companies
operating in the construction sector are considered nonresident entities. This leads to discrepancies
with national accounts statistics where this activity is treated as domestic production. In external debt
statistics there are discrepancies between data compiled by different governmental agencies owing to
methodological differences. Statistical treatment of trade within the customs union is not accurate,
which has contributed to large and increasing errors and omissions. The authorities are cooperating
with relevant agencies in the customs union partner countries to resolve these problems.

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2014 Article IV Consultation with the
Republic of Kazakhstan

On July 21, 2014, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded the
Article IV consultation1 with Kazakhstan.
Growth slowed from 6 percent in 2013 to 3.8 percent year-on-year in the first quarter of 2014.
The slowdown reflects weaker external demand, especially from China and Russia, the
confidence effects of regional tensions and the February devaluation of the tenge on domestic
demand, and slower production in the mining sector. Inflation, on the other hand, has risen, fueled
by the devaluation and amid heightened external uncertainties, reaching 7 percent year-on-year in
June compared with 4.8 percent at end-2013. Fiscal balances improved significantly last year and
the national oil fund assets reached 31 percent of GDP. The banking sector recovery continues.
Real GDP growth in 2014 is projected at 4.8 percent, one percentage point below earlier
projections, despite the expected positive contributions from the fiscal stimulus. At the same
time, headline inflation is expected to further increase to around 9 percent in 2014, although the
authorities are determined to maintain it within the 6–8 percent target range. Medium-term
growth prospects hinge on the projected rise in oil output. Risks to the outlook are
predominantly on the downside, reflecting possible additional unfavorable developments in
Russia and Ukraine, and a prolonged slowdown in emerging markets.
The authorities have taken more aggressive steps to reduce the large stock of Non Performing
Loans (NPLs), and have committed to enhancing the monetary and fiscal policy frameworks.
They have also strengthened their commitment to speeding up structural reforms and in this
context deepened their cooperation with the multilateral development institutions. The newly
launched Eurasian Economic Union, with Belarus, Kazakhstan, and Russia as members, will

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with members, usually
every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial information, and discusses with officials
the country's economic developments and policies. On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which
forms the basis for discussion by the Executive Board.

formally come into effect in January 2015, while accession to the World Trade Organization
(WTO) is expected later this year.
Executive Board Assessment2
Directors commended Kazakhstan’s solid economic performance in recent years. However,
given the recent growth slowdown and rise in inflation amid heightened external uncertainties,
Directors stressed the importance of strengthening the macroeconomic policy frameworks to
improve the economy’s resilience and long-term prospects.
Directors considered the near-term fiscal policy stance to be appropriately supportive of growth,
but saw a need to better ensure the quality and transparency of planned increases in spending.
They also welcomed the authorities’ commitment to reducing the non-oil deficit to its sustainable
level by 2018. More broadly, Directors recommended strengthening fiscal policymaking by
reducing off-budget operations and further integrating the annual budget and medium-term fiscal
plans into the broader macroeconomic framework. In this context, Directors stressed the
importance of prudent and transparent management of resource wealth to safeguard the integrity
of the budget process and intergenerational equity.
Directors emphasized the need to stand ready to tighten monetary policy while improving the
monetary policy framework and operations. They suggested speeding up the introduction of a
new policy rate instrument supported by open market operations, which would aid liquidity
management and open the door for a more flexible management of the exchange rate. They also
noted that enhancing communications to anchor expectations and gradually widening the
exchange rate band would facilitate adoption of inflation targeting over the medium term.
Directors took note of the staff assessment that Kazakhstan’s real effective exchange rate
appeared to be only moderately overvalued at end-2013.
Directors encouraged the authorities to fully implement the recommendations from the recent
Financial Sector Assessment Program. They welcomed the authorities’ more aggressive efforts
to reduce the large stock of nonperforming loans, and highlighted the urgency of supervisory
actions to enforce nonperforming loan ceilings and ensure adequate provisions. Directors also
underscored the importance of an asset quality review by an independent international entity
ahead of the merger of two systemic financial institutions. They also recommended further
strengthening risk-based supervisory functions and closely monitoring foreign currency risks
associated with increased dollarization.

At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the Board, summarizes the views of
Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the country's authorities. An explanation of any qualifiers
used in summings up can be found here: http://www.imf.org/external/np/sec/misc/qualifiers.htm.

3
Directors commended the authorities’ commitment to an ambitious structural reform agenda that
would help Kazakhstan become a dynamic emerging market economy and ensure sustainable
and inclusive growth. They agreed that priority should be given to strengthening human capital
and institutions and lowering the role of the state in the economy. Directors encouraged the
authorities to intensify their efforts to reduce labor market skill mismatches, address barriers to
starting new businesses, and enforce contracts. Avoiding price controls will also be important.
Directors welcomed the authorities’ increased cooperation with multilateral institutions to
advance structural reforms.
