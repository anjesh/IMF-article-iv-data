STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2012 ARTICLE IV CONSULTATION
June 12, 2012

KEY ISSUES
Context: Luxembourg’s hallmark stability has served well its economy and financial
system. The latter endured the euro area crisis in 2011 and experienced limited
spillover effects from the breakup of Dexia group, whose subsidiary had substantial
retail operations in Luxembourg. Still, the economy is poised to slow further in 2012,
with weak prospects in the euro area prospects tilting risks to the downside.
The financial sector: The banking sector’s main risk is its exposure to foreign parent
banks. In this regard, Luxembourg’s supervision has been strengthened but further
efforts are needed to clarify the roles of its supervisory authority and central bank,
including regarding liquidity supervision. Luxembourg should also move ahead with
non-legislative measures on bank resolution and deposit insurance as it awaits EU-level
finalization of those legal frameworks.
Fiscal policy: Besides continued current expenditure restraint to forestall rising public
debt, a high-quality consolidation should be supported by a medium-term fiscal
framework. Still, aging-related expenditures challenge fiscal stability. Luxembourg’s
generous pension system is not sustainable and will require more comprehensive
reform than the proposed long-run incentives to increase the effective retirement age.
Structural policies: Boosting long-run growth will largely depend on reforming labor
markets to address skill mismatches and negative work incentives. Further efforts are
also needed to limit harmful competitiveness effects of automatic backward-looking
wage indexation with a view of eliminating it in the medium term. Product market
reforms can support these efforts by fostering competition, spurring productivity
growth and possibly increasing economic diversification.

Box 1. Recent Developments in the Financial Sector
The investment fund industry’s brisk recovery
following the global financial crisis has slowed.
Assets under management started to recover shortly
after the crisis and in mid-2010 surpassed their precrisis peak. This trend was partially reversed in the
second half of 2011, due to market valuation losses
and, to a lesser extent, redemptions. The industry,
however, has recovered the losses as worldwide
markets trended up in early 2012. Assets under
management have remained above €2 trillion and
the number of funds has increased by about
5 percent compared to their pre-crisis level.

In contrast, Luxembourg-based banks have been
slower to recover. Banks’ assets hit bottom in
February 2011. Most of the decline was associated
with exposures to other credit institutions (mostly
cross-border intra-bank group) that declined about
20 percent. Credit to customers nonetheless fell by
less than 10 percent. While bank assets have begun
recovering, they have remained far below their precrisis peak.

Still, Luxembourg-based banks have
generally remained well capitalized,
profitable and liquid. Their overall capital
adequacy ratio has improved reflecting shrinking
risk-weighted assets. Banks have continued to
post profits although these are substantially
lower than before the global financial crisis
(Figure 4). In 2011, the decline largely reflected
securities portfolio-related valuation losses,
particularly in European sovereign bonds. The
overall liquidity ratio has improved but
Luxembourg-based banks have remained
substantially exposed to risks arising from
foreign parent banks.
Bank exposures to distressed sovereigns in the
European periphery are generally contained,
but cross-border exposures remain high.
Exposures to distressed sovereigns have declined
and account for less than 2 percent of total assets.
These are concentrated in a small number of banks
with limited retail deposits. More generally though,
cross-border (mainly intragroup) exposures still
account for about ¾ of Luxembourg-based banks’
loans.

Box 2. Evolution of Competitiveness and External Stability
Following a decade of deterioration,
Luxembourg’s competitiveness gap has narrowed
since 2010 (Figure 5). Wage increases associated
with automatic backward wage indexation
outstripped productivity gains for a number of years.
In the aftermath of the global financial crisis, labor
hoarding resulted in a sharp decline in labor
productivity, far exceeding declines in neighboring
countries. More recently, labor cost increases have
been slowed by a sluggish labor market as well as by
the postponement of automatic wage indexation
adjustments. In 2011, some competitiveness gains
have continued in unit labor cost-based real effective
exchange rates and average CGER-based
competitiveness gap. Besides some unwinding of
labor hoarding, these improvements reflect
Luxembourg’s medium-term current account balance
that is now projected to be closer to its NFA
stabilizing level. These medium-term projections are,
however, subject to large uncertainty due to the
intrinsic volatility in financial services export statistics.
Balance of payments flows are dominated by the
financial sector. Specifically, financial sector flows

international financial groups with limited impact on
domestic intermediation (Annex I). From
Luxembourg’s perspective, the financial center can
be viewed as akin to a non-financial exporting
industry. In this context, global financial shocks can
have an asymmetrical impact on the center’s assets
and liabilities, contributing to volatility in
Luxembourg’s international investment position. The
impact of these shocks however has been primarily
on employment and tax revenues.

Box 3. Progress in Implementing Key Recommendations of the FSAP Update
A. Institutional Aspects
 Legislation was amended to improve the
operational independence of the CSSF granting it
authorization power regarding some changes in
financial institutions. Further measures are under
consideration.


In light of the European Systemic Risk Board’s
(ESRB’s) recommendation on establishing a
national macroprudential authority, the authorities
are exploring ways to clarify more broadly the
supervisory responsibilities of the BCL and CSSF.

B. Conduct of Financial Sector Supervision
 Staff and resources available for the CSSF’s
supervisory and enforcement functions have been
increased substantially. This has translated into
more frequent on-site inspections and enhanced
risk-based supervision of banks and investment
funds, with stress testing more integrated into
supervisory planning.


A number of organizational and procedural
changes have taken place to expedite enforcement
actions. These include the issuance of internal
rules, the creation of the enforcement committee
as well as a division devoted to investment fund
enforcement.



The CSSF continues active participation in
supervisory college meetings contributing to
improve their monitoring of cross-border
exposures to parent banks. Following the EBA
recommendations, relevant European
supervisors have started to conduct joint risk
assessments of banking groups following a
common approach.



Disclosure requirements for investment funds
were strengthened to clarify shareholder and
ownership rights. An EU-level legislative
proposal standardizing and strengthening the
role of depositaries is expected to be
published in 2012.

C. Financial Safety Net
 A law requiring speedier payments by the
deposit insurance scheme was enacted. While
waiting for progress of EU-level initiatives, the
authorities have been studying options to
strengthen the bank resolution framework
and upgrade the deposit insurance scheme.


The authorities have been in discussions with
Clearstream Banking Luxembourg to prepare
contingency plans and have been studying

Looking forward, the authorities

have begun reforming the old-age pension
and health care systems. Aging-related
expenditure pressures are widespread in the
EU. But the generosity of Luxembourg’s
pension system—and its associated low
effective retirement age—translates into the
largest increases in aging expenditures in the
EU (Figure 8). The authorities have recently
introduced so-called “pension à la carte.” It
fully grandfathers the rights accrued under the
existing regime and will take 40 years to be
fully in force. At that time, workers could draw
a reduced pension (about 8½ percent lower)
at the current effective retirement age (about
58 years of age5) or elect to work three more
years and obtained an unreduced pension.
With respect to health care, the 2011 reforms
included an increase in contributions and
higher financial burden-sharing of the patients,
tighter budgetary constraints for hospitals and
practitioners, and promotion of generic drugs.
As a result, the health care system is estimated
to have generated a surplus of about
0.15 percent of GDP in 2011.

comprehensive old-age pension reform.
Even if the effective retirement age were to
increase by three years in the long run, it would
remain below today’s EU average. Moreover,
the reform would not suffice to place social
security on a strong financial footing and
places a disproportionate burden on younger
generations to support the unsustainably
generous benefits of those being
grandfathered. Luxembourg must consider
further reforms to better align benefits to
contributions. In this regard, it should increase
the statutory retirement age—following the
lead of other European countries facing far less
aging-related pressures (Annex III)—and limit
pension benefit adjustments to cost-of-living
indexation. The latter would eliminate what
amounts to double indexation of benefits to
wages and prices. In addition, there remains an
urgent need to vastly curtail, if not eliminate,
complementary periods, during which benefits
accrue without corresponding contributions.

1/ Shaded areas represent actual data. Individual shocks are permanent one-half standard deviation shocks. Figures in the boxes
represent average projections for the respective variables in the baseline and scenario being presented. Ten-year historical average
for the variable is also shown.
2/ Permanent 1/4 standard deviation shocks applied to real interest rate, growth rate, and primary balance.
3/ One-time real depreciation of 30 percent and 10 percent of GDP shock to contingent liabilities occur in 2010, with real
depreciation defined as nominal depreciation (measured by percentage fall in dollar value or local currency) minus domestic
inflation (based on GDP deflator).

Strong intensification
of the euro area crisis

Relative Likelihood

Impact if Realized

Medium

High

A strong intensification of the crisis
could affect both the real economy
(a recession affecting employment
and output) and the financial system
through both direct (losses on
sovereign debt holdings) and
indirect effects (contagion, intragroup exposures).

 Output losses and further increases in
unemployment. Luxembourg-based outwardoriented banks could be resilient if there is no major
failure of relevant parent banks. But liquidity
pressures could resurface. Domestically-oriented
banks could be affected through higher
unemployment and household’s inability to repay
debt, also possibly impacting real estate values.
 Though bank exposure to distressed sovereign
bonds has declined, these remain sizeable in some
banks. Losses from these holdings could threaten a
few small banks.

Failure of a parent
bank

Medium
A sizeable sovereign or funding
shock could cause major global or
European financial institutions to fail.

High
Most banks are exposed to parent banks through
large intra-group positions and reputation effects.
Thus, parent failures are likely to be disruptive. Also,
for domestically-active subsidiaries, the failure of a
parent bank could result in large contingent fiscal
liabilities for Luxembourg.

Low/Medium

High

Inability to carry out
fiscal consolidation in
accordance with
announced intentions

Luxembourg’s fiscal position appears
favorable, but crisis measures have
taken their toll on public debt, with
forthcoming sharing of e-commerce
revenues further challenging fiscal
stability.

Public debt would almost double in five years with no
policy change (Figure 7), and would more than double
under a low growth scenario. Luxembourg would not
be well-placed to withstand further shocks, nor to
manage its looming pension obligations, even if
proposed pension reforms are implemented.

Low

High

Global financial
regulation and tax
reforms.

Luxembourg’s position as a financial
center could be threatened by
changes in prudential regulations
and international taxation.

The financial center’s cross-border activities could
shrink, with adverse impact on employment and value
added in the medium-term.

Low

High (over the medium-term)

Loss of confidence in
investment fund
industry

 Damage to Luxembourg’s funds’
brand name owing to negative
reputational effects from large
global investment fund failures.
 Renewed turbulence in financial
markets could lead to large-scale
fund redemptions.

 Investment funds redemption could temporarily
depress asset market prices and create a need for
liquidity.


In the medium-term, the loss of business would
hurt employment and value added.

sectors of the economy, especially the
manufacturing sector, which has
experienced productivity losses in the past
decade (Figure A6). Luxembourg’s
manufacturing sector employs a
disproportionate share of the labor force.
Specifically, the sector’s share of employment
exceeds its share in output; the opposite holds
for the service sector (Figure A6). This is not a
typical pattern: in most countries the service
sector’s employment share is higher than its
output share. In large part, Luxembourg’s
sectoral employment pattern reflects the
dominance of financial and associated services,
and the underdevelopment of other services
(Figure A7). Finance and related services mostly
employ highly educated and trained individuals
thus limiting its labor-absorbing capacity.

entrepreneurship and FDI, and sectoral
regulations in transportation and
communication, retail, and professional
services. This reflects the fact that Luxembourg
has fallen behind in reforming its product
markets—which were relatively less regulated
earlier in the decade—compared to other
European countries. Partly by affecting the
efficient allocation of resources, PMR, EPL, and
employment support programs have likely
impacted productivity growth and held back
the development of a diversified service sector
that could generate higher employment.

5.

In Luxembourg, this evidence is

further supported by new-firm survival
rates. Luxembourg’s new-firm survival rates
are generally higher compared to a number of
European countries (Figure A10). This may be
explained by the fact that when regulations
thwart competition, inefficient firms are able to
continue operating with limited market
pressure. Of note, although the survival rate is
higher for Luxembourg in most of the service

Exchange Rate Arrangement
Luxembourg’s currency is the euro, which floats
freely and independently against other
currencies. Luxembourg has accepted the
obligations of Article VIII, Sections 2, 3, and 4,
and maintains an exchange system free of
restrictions on payments and transfers for
current international transactions, other than
restrictions notified to the Fund under Decision
No. 144 (52/51).
Anti-Money Laundering/Combating the
Financing of Terrorism (AML/CFT)
In early 2011, the Financial Action Task Force
(FATF) concluded that Luxembourg had made
progress to remedy several deficiencies in its
AML/CFT, and ended the enhanced review
process of the FATF’s International Cooperation
Review Group. Luxembourg is now subject to a
yearly follow-up by the FATF. However, some

LUXEMBOURG

shortcomings remain, in particular in relation to
legal entities transparency (i.e. beneficial
ownerships and control), and the FATF has

been encouraging Luxembourg to continue its
efforts to remedy all deficiencies identified in
its mutual evaluation report.

STATISTICAL ISSUES
(As of May 31, 2012)
I. Assessment of Data Adequacy for Surveillance

General: Data provision is adequate for surveillance. The Central Service for Statistics and
Economic Studies (Statec) regularly publishes a full range of economic and financial data and
provides an advance release calendar for main statistical releases at:
http://www.statistiques.public.lu/fr/agenda/calendrier-diffusion/index.html.
On-line access to Statec’s databases and those of other jurisdictions is available to all users
simultaneously at the time of release through the Statistics Portal of Luxembourg.
Key publicly accessible websites for macroeconomic data and analysis are:
Statistics Portal of Luxembourg .......................................... http://www.statistiques.public.lu/fr/

Central Bank of Luxembourg ............................................... http://www.bcl.lu/en/index.php
Ministry of Finance ................................................................... http://www.mf.public.lu/
National Accounts: Luxembourg avails itself of the SDDS special flexibility for the timeliness of
the national accounts, and generally disseminates national accounts data not later than four
months after the reference period (the SDDS timeliness requirement for the national accounts is
three months). Reduction of the reporting lag would aid surveillance.
II. Data Standards and Quality
Subscriber to the Fund’s Special Data
Dissemination Standard (SDDS) since May 12,
2006. Uses SDDS flexibility options on the
timeliness of national accounts and analytical
accounts of the central bank.

No data ROSC is available.

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2012 Article IV Consultation with
Luxembourg
On June 27, 2012, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded the
Article IV consultation with Luxembourg. 1
Background
Economic growth has slowed in 2011 amid the euro area sovereign debt crisis. Private
consumption held up in the first half of the year. But as the crisis and uncertainty lingered,
consumer and manufacturing business confidence fell and slowed domestic demand. Reflecting
the waning impact of global fuel price increases and postponements in automatic wage
indexation, inflation has eased. In recent months, employment growth has remained stable but
the unemployment rate has risen, particularly long-run joblessness that accounts for about
45 percent of overall unemployment.
The fiscal deficit fell in 2011, reflecting an over performance in revenues and continued
expenditure restraint. Staff estimates that the structural deficit, at ½ percent of GDP, was
roughly unchanged from 2010. Public debt has nonetheless almost tripled to about 20 percent
of GDP since the outset of the global financial crisis and is poised to continue increasing in the
face of medium-term fiscal pressures.
Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On
return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the
Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the
Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the
country's authorities. An explanation of any qualifiers used in summings up can be found here:
http://www.imf.org/external/np/sec/misc/qualifiers.htm.
1

2
The financial sector has endured the crisis and remained stable. The investment fund industry
experienced some valuation losses in 2011 mainly due to euro area related market turbulence,
but has largely recovered, with assets under management surpassing €2 trillion in early 2012.
Though bank assets have been slower to recover, Luxembourg-based banks have generally
remained well capitalized, profitable, and liquid. Their exposures to distressed sovereigns in the
European periphery are generally contained, but cross-border exposures remain high. Crossborder, mainly intragroup, exposures still account for about ¾ of bank loans.
Reflecting sluggish external demand, economic activity is expected to further weaken, with
growth projected to decline to ½ percent in 2012. Volatile financial markets and unclear
economic prospects will likely continue to weigh on domestic demand. These factors will also
likely reduce price pressures and reinforce inflation’s declining trend. Risks are tilted to the
downside given ongoing uncertainties in the euro area.
Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors welcomed the continued stability of Luxembourg’s economy despite the
turbulence in the euro area, but noted that slowing activity and an uncertain economic outlook
call for further steps to limit financial sector risks, safeguard fiscal sustainability, and boost
medium-term growth.
Directors commended the authorities on measures taken to strengthen the financial sector and
implement recommendations from the Financial Stability Assessment Program update. They
supported further participation in EU supervisory colleges and the development of similar
arrangements to promote cross-border cooperation among supervisors of non-EU banking
groups and investment funds. Directors also advised the authorities to continue pursuing ahead
of EU-level initiatives, if appropriate, regulatory enhancements not requiring legislation, and to
continue encouraging banks to prepare for tighter liquidity standards under Basel III. More
broadly, Directors saw scope for revisiting institutional arrangements for regulation and
supervision, to better align these with evolving international standards. Regarding the AML/CFT
framework, Directors noted the authorities’ commitment to undertake the needed measures to
comply with revised FATF standards.
Directors welcomed the support to the economy provided by the 2012 budget. They urged the
authorities to adhere to the budget’s expenditure allocations but cautioned that reliance on
public investment caps could hurt growth in the long run. Directors generally agreed that
automatic stabilizers should be allowed to operate if downside risks materialized. A few
Directors, however, were not convinced that this would be effective, given low fiscal multipliers
and the need to preserve hard-won credibility.

3
In light of the expected deterioration in public finances in coming years, Directors encouraged
high-quality consolidation measures supported by a medium-term fiscal framework. In
particular, while welcoming the proposed pension reforms, they urged the authorities to
undertake a more comprehensive reform of the pension and healthcare systems to ensure fiscal
sustainability.
Directors commended the authorities’ efforts to lay the foundation for higher medium-term
growth through a comprehensive reform agenda. They encouraged nonetheless further steps to
improve active labor market policies and the social safety net with a view to minimizing work
disincentives and addressing market rigidities. Directors also welcomed measures to limit the
adverse competitiveness effects of the wage indexation system, and suggested revising or
eliminating this system in the medium term. Product market regulations should also be reviewed
to foster competition, productivity growth, and economic diversification.

Statement by Willy Kiekens, Executive Director for Luxembourg
and Amela Hubic, Advisor to the Executive Director
June 27, 2012
The Luxembourg authorities would like to thank staff for their comprehensive and useful
analysis that provides an objective view of the macro-economic situation in Luxembourg
and the challenges the economy is facing. However, the authorities note that the structure
of the staff report is not rightly balanced as financial sector issues cover a significant part
of the report. The FSAP update, that took place in September 2011, has already tackled in
detail the current state of the financial sector and the remaining challenges. More analysis
and advice on macro-policy and on public finances would have been appreciated. The
authorities broadly share the views of the staff.
The country’s stable political, social and regulatory environments have helped its
economy and financial sector to endure the recent global financial and the ongoing
European sovereign debt crisis. The authorities have followed prudent macroeconomic
policies and have paid careful attention to developing a business friendly climate and will
continue to do so. They are committed to take all the necessary measures to further
ensure the stability of the financial sector; long-run fiscal sustainability; and continued
growth and employment. Diversification of the forward-looking financial sector across
business types, investment destinations and customer bases has helped the economy to
weather the crisis. Looking forward, the authorities are committed to pursue efforts to
diversify the structure of the economy by developing new lines of business outside of
financial sector realm (e.g. ICT, logistics or clean technologies). Finally, Luxembourg is
among the very few European countries to maintain an AAA credit rating assessment
with stable outlook, clearly demonstrating the market’s trust in the country.
Recent economic developments and outlook
After a severe downturn in 2009, the Luxembourg economy recovered in 2010 and
registered a real GDP growth of 2.7 percent. In 2011, growth decelerated to 1.6 percent in
the context of the slowdown of European economies. During the last quarter of 2011, the
Luxembourg economy grew by only 0.8 percent. This deteriorating situation primarily
reflects weaker export demand resulting inter alia from a restricted fiscal stance at the
European level, a substantial deterioration in both business and consumer confidence
stemming from the sovereign debt crisis and the negative effect that all these
developments had on financial markets. In 2012, the Statistical Office (Statec) and the
Central Bank of Luxembourg (BCL) project real growth to be 1 percent of GDP, 0.5
percent higher than staff’s projections, before recovering to just above 2 percent in 2013.
In this difficult economic environment, employment growth has been decelerating,
although remaining positive at 1.9 percent in April 2012. Close to one third of new jobs
were created in the public sector (broad definition) while employment growth in the
private sector was more subdued. Nonetheless, the seasonally adjusted unemployment
rate is on the rise, reaching a historical peak of 6.1 percent in April 2012. Unemployment
tends to become more structural as rightly emphasized in the staff report. Almost half of

2
the unemployed are low-skilled and a quarter of them are older than 50. The authorities
are aware of this tendency and are planning to adopt measures to address it. The Ministry
of Labor has already put in place some policies designed to preserve labor market
participation among individuals over 50 who have recently lost their job.
Public finances
The economic and financial crisis has weakened the state of public finances in
Luxembourg. Despite this negative evolution, Luxembourg has maintained its relatively
low level of public debt as well as a budgetary safety margin in relation to the Maastricht
reference value of 3 percent of GDP. Nevertheless, the country is facing a series of
challenges of a structural nature that will have an impact on public finances. Potential
growth is declining, and so will be the growth of public revenues. The high degree of
openness of the economy and its specialization in financial services make public revenues
subject to high volatility. At the same time, public expenditures are sticky downwards
with a significant part being growing autonomously, independent of the business cycle.
Finally, public finances in Luxembourg are highly exposed to population ageing.
The general government deficit declined from 0.9 percent of GDP in 2010 to 0.6 percent
in 2011. Spending growth was kept below nominal GDP growth. New tax measures are
estimated to have yielded 0.5 percent of GDP additional revenues. The debt-to-GDP ratio
declined from 19.1 percent to 18.2 percent.
With weak GDP-growth this year, the fiscal deficit is allowed to increase to 1.5 percent
of GDP in 2012. For next year, in line with the country’s latest update of its Stability and
Growth Program (April 2012) fiscal consolidation measures have been announced for the
period 2013 – 2015. These measures should reduce the deficit to 1.2 percent of GDP in
2013 and by an additional 1 percent of GDP annually thereafter, compared to unchanged
policies. Adjustment measures include expenditure reductions for 2/3 and revenue
increases for 1/3. The authorities would have appreciated a clearer presentation of this
consolidation package in the staff report for the period 2013 – 2014, as it is not clear
whether staff’s projections include the government’s consolidation package or not.
The authorities are skeptical about staff’s suggestion to let automatic stabilizers operate
since in Luxembourg fiscal multipliers are rather low or close to zero, as recognized by
the staff. Given the political difficulties in reducing the fiscal deficit, the authorities are
reluctant to allow deviations from the nominal consolidation path.
The general government balance is projected to continue to improve in 2014. However,
in 2015, despite a favorable macroeconomic context, a structural change in the VAT
regime will cause a revenue loss of about 1 percent of GDP due to a shift from the
domicile of the e-commerce service provider to the residence of the consumer. This
revenue drop will gradually increase as the change in the VAT regime is introduced
gradually. In line with the European directive, 70 percent of the VAT receipts will be
transferred to the ‘consumer’ countries during the first two-year period, 85 percent in
2017 and 2018, and 100 percent only in 2019. The staff estimate of these revenue losses
seems to neglect this gradual phasing in.

3

If Luxembourg has not achieved its medium-term objective of a structural surplus of 0.5
percent of GDP in 2015, the authorities are committed to adopt additional measures in
order to bring public finances back towards the medium-term fiscal objective.
The staff report rightly points out that the debt-to-GDP ratio has almost tripled in the
period 2007-2011, from 6.7 to about 18.2 percent. Let us nonetheless observe that
Luxembourg’s debt level remains well below the 60 percent level of the Maastricht
criteria, that the net public debt is significantly lower (Luxembourg’s participation in
PNB Paribas alone amounts to 6 percent of GDP) and that the public debt is entirely
denominated in euros. The authorities are committed to keep the public debt at low levels
as the only sustainable trajectory for Luxembourg.
Short-term public finances indicators in Luxembourg are favorable when compared with
peer countries. Nonetheless, there are long-term challenges. The authorities are aware of
the importance of putting the public finances on a sound footing in the long term. Since
Luxembourg is a small open economy, from the authorities’ point of view, public debt
levels should remain well below the Maastricht criteria, even in case of a renewed
downturn. This will preserve long-term economic stability and business attractiveness of
the country. Therefore, several initiatives have been taken. An important healthcare
reform has become effective from January 1, 2011. Further reforms are being developed,
including the restructuring of the hospital sector starting in 2013. A draft pension reform
will be discussed in Parliament in the second half of 2012. The government concurs with
the staff’s view about the urgent need to place Luxembourg’s old-age pension system
(public and private) on a sustainable path. The existing pension system suffers from a
number of costly rigidities, including the indexation of benefits to both price and real
wage developments. The authorities are aware that this reform might not be sufficient to
solve the problems of the pension system. Under the new pension regime, the
government’s reassessment every five years should prompt corrective measures in case of
expected shortfalls. Finally, the authorities are working on establishing a multi-year
budgetary framework to deliver the needed fiscal consolidation. The framework would
apply to all levels of the government, and include multi-year expenditure ceilings,
consistent with the new EU requirements under the legislative “six pack” (to be
transposed by the end of 2013) and the Fiscal Compact.
Financial sector and developments in supervision
The banking sector has recently suffered from the ongoing sovereign debt crisis in the
euro area. The aggregate bank balance sheet, after having recovered to more than euro
800 billion in January 2012, receded again in the following months to stabilize in April
2012 at a level slightly higher than the yearly average observed in 2011 (780 billion
euros). This contraction follows declining asset values and reduced exposure on
sovereigns and other banks. Bank profits before taxes, depreciation and provisions,
declined by more than 11 percent in the first quarter of 2012 to around 1.4 billion euros.
Still, Luxembourg-based banks remain well capitalized, profitable and liquid.

While some banks are retreating from Luxembourg, mainly because of restructuring
measures or because their business model does not fit the Luxembourg financial sector,
large banking groups expand their presence in Luxembourg because of its role and
expertise as a hub for back-office and custodian services. Private banking is also
undergoing a transformation, becoming more service oriented and catering increasingly
to a more sophisticated clientele.
The investment fund industry is an important component of the Luxembourg’s financial
system. Although affected by the recent global financial crisis, the fund industry has
recovered well. With over 2.2 trillion euro in April 2012, assets in Luxembourgdomiciled regulated funds reached a historical ceiling1. This is a result of both revaluation
of assets held and new inflows. The number of investment funds has increased by 178
units between end 2010 and 2011 (from 3667 to 3845). Anecdotal evidence also suggests
that investment funds that used to be offshore before the crisis are now seeking the safety
of a regulated product like the UCITS brand and of a domicile in Luxembourg. Overall, it
seems that the Luxembourg fund industry is weathering well the ongoing sovereign euro
area debt crisis – both from a financial stability point of view and with regard to its
reputation as a well regulated product. Moreover, the authorities do not share staff’s point
of view that euro area turbulence could result in outflows of funds. If the investors want
to change their investment portfolio and invest in other regions rather than in the euro
area, they will probably opt for another Luxembourg-domiciled fund offering exposure to
that specific region which in the end would not cause any outflows from the fund
industry. The experience in recent crisis (e.g. Irish case) provides some evidence. Both
the authorities and the fund industry’s management are confident about the outlook. The
data of the first four months of 2012 indicate that the net asset value as well as the
number of units has continued to increase. The industry management indicated that it
does not expect any significant new inflows of assets for the rest of the year but is
confident that the industry is able to maintain the current level.
Luxembourg financial sector exposure to European periphery countries has declined
significantly since the last consultation, as rightly noted in staff report, and represents a
small share of overall assets. Moreover, the authorities are confident that, in an extreme
tail event, the banking sector’s strong capital position provides comfort in this regard.
Regarding Luxembourg Fund industry, the exposure to distressed sovereigns is limited.
Solvency, Tier 1 capital and liquidity indicators are traditionally high in Luxembourg
and remain so. Although Luxembourg-based banks have registered losses in their
securities portfolios in 2011, they remain highly capitalized. Moreover, following the
EBA recommendation of 8 December 2011 on the recapitalization of European banking
groups, the banking supervision authority (CSSF) has increased the capital requirements
for all Luxembourg based banks (not just those required by EBA) to a minimum 9
percent of risk-weighted assets in Core Tier I capital. The authorities acknowledge that
the liquidity standards under Basel III (CRDIV/CRR in Europe) could be challenging if

applied at the solo/sub-consolidated level. The CSSF and the BCL are closely following
developments on that front.
Regulatory issues. The authorities have made substantial progress in strengthening
financial sector supervision and the regulatory framework. To improve the financial
stability policy framework, the authorities followed the FSAP recommendation by further
enhancing on-site supervisions and by hiring highly qualified staff. Indeed, the staff and
resources of CSSF have been significantly increased and resulted in more frequent on-site
inspections (from 38 in 2009 to 85 inspections in 2011 of banks) and augmented
enforcement actions (from 4 in 2009 to 72 inspections of investment funds). Similarly,
the BCL has vastly expanded its supervisory activities by also recruiting additional staff
and expending the financial stability and prudential supervision department resources.
The latter integrates one unit in charge of liquidity surveillance, one in charge of
oversight of payment and settlement infrastructures and the financial stability unit
tackling the macro-prudential aspects and assessing systemic liquidity risk. The BCL
liquidity monitoring and surveillance framework at the institutional level comprises
qualitative and forward-looking quantitative analysis, which includes both off-site
analysis and on-site inspections. In this context, the BCL has conducted in 2011 nine onsite inspections in close cooperation with the CSSF. In addition, the central bank requires
from a large proportion of banks to provide their liquidity gap projections on a daily
basis. As regards the bank resolution regime and deposit insurance scheme, the
authorities would like to emphasize the importance of moving in lockstep with EU-level
regulations which is consistent with Luxembourg tradition of regulatory stability but also
with other EU countries.
The financial industry had recognized the value of stronger supervision for financial
stability, which provides an additional safety net for investors, and has welcomed the
constructive dialogues with supervisors (CSSF and BCL) as well as with Luxembourg
authorities.
The authorities take note of staff recommendations for refinements in Luxembourg’s
institutional frameworks for financial supervision and regulation – in line with the FSAP
update as well as forthcoming EU requirements – namely: clarifying the respective roles
and duties of the CSSF and BCL on liquidity risk supervision; establishing a national
macro-prudential authority with a central bank taking a leading role; and strengthening
the CSSF’s operational independence. They take all these three issues very seriously and
intend to take legislative actions to address them in a holistic manner. They stress that
operational independence of institutions should go hand in hand with accountability and
responsibility. The legislative actions will probably take place in the second part of 2012.
At the international level both the BCL and the CSSF are engaged in exchange,
discussion and analytical work on the new European supervisory infrastructure EBA and
ESRB. Moreover, exchange of supervisory information and home-host coordination takes
place at the level of supervisory Colleges and Cross Boarder Stability Groups for all
important banking groups with cross border activities. In addition, the BCL and the CSSF

are engaging intensively with banks to prepare them for potential future changes in
regulation.
Other issues
Diversification of the economy. The authorities are committed to pursue efforts to
diversify the structure of the economy which is currently largely based on the financial
sector activities (close to 30 percent of GDP) that contribute significantly to fiscal
revenues (around 25 percent of total revenues) as well as to employment (around 10
percent of employment). At the beginning of 2012, the authorities founded a Luxembourg
Future Fund to support the diversification and sustainable development of the economy.
The Fund should invest directly or via other funds in innovative small and medium
enterprises in a start-up or development phase in technology sectors (e.g. ICT or clean
technologies). The government will invest 120 million euro in the Fund via the ‘Société
Nationale de Crédit et d’Investissement (SNCI)’ and the European Investment Fund will
contribute another 30 million euros. In addition, the government will invest in health
sciences and technology via an existing private fund.
Competitiveness and unit labor cost. The authorities have noted the deterioration in price
competitiveness over the last decade (unit labor costs rising much faster than in
neighboring countries) due to high wage increases coupled with low productivity growth.
Wages and benefits are linked to inflation through an automatic indexation mechanism.
The authorities took steps to improve competitiveness by adjusting the system of wage
indexation. In December 2011, Parliament adopted a law to temporarily modify the
automatic indexation of wages. The automatic indexation of wages, which would have
occurred in March 2012, has been postponed to October 2012. Moreover, until 2014, at
least 12 months should elapse between each indexation step of 2.5 percent. With the
introduction of this minimum interval, wages and benefits will no longer be fully indexed
to the cost of living in the event that inflation exceeds 2.5 percent. This so-called
‘modulation of the wage indexation system’ prevents an upward spiral of cost and price
increases and will have a temporary effect on cost competitiveness, especially in times of
high inflation. From 2015 on, the automatic indexation will return to its previous mode,
but the counter for the next automatic wage indexation will be set to zero. As a
consequence, some of the gains in cost competitiveness will be permanent. The
authorities are aware that this modulation is only temporary and that the room of
manoeuvre in terms of productivity gains is getting smaller. Therefore, it is essential to
ensure the competitiveness by limiting the growth of unit labor costs. During this
temporary modulation period, the authorities will be working with unions and employers’
representatives on a more permanent solution which should not undermine social
cohesion in Luxembourg.
