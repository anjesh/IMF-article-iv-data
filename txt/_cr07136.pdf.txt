EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
Challenges. Real wage growth is running at rates well above growth of labor
productivity. The government is under pressure to lower taxes, through further
exemptions and a cut in the personal income tax (PIT) rate. Notwithstanding the
banking sector’s strengths, rapid credit expansion, associated with the greater-thanprojected widening of the current account deficit, requires continued vigilance.
Staff views. Fiscal consolidation remains the only tool available to cool the economy.
A front-loaded consolidation would mitigate the risk of continued upward pressure on
wages and a loss of competitiveness. Eliminating tax exemptions will broaden the tax
base and improve the fairness of the tax system. An Earned Income Tax Credit can
increase the incentives of young and low-skill workers to participate in the labor force.
Despite the decline in the capital adequacy ratio from earlier in the decade, financial
buffers appear sufficient to cover nonsystemic risks. Nevertheless, the authorities must
maintain their efforts to contain financial vulnerabilities.
Authorities’ views. The authorities place a lower probability than does staff on the risk
of a loss of competitiveness and a consequent hard landing. They remain committed to
fiscal consolidation over the medium term but do not see scope for ambitious front
loading. They are concerned about the proliferation of exemptions and agreed that
further PIT cuts should be placed in the context of a broader tax reform package. But
they stressed that specific tax and expenditure reforms would be based on political
feasibility. They judge the financial sector to be productive and stable.

The policy challenges faced today by the Lithuanian authorities are the
outcome of much success. The catch-up in per capita income toward the European
average, underpinned by robust productivity growth, has been impressive. Following a
decade-long effort at establishing a market economy, the momentum accelerated in 2003 as
accession to the European Union (EU) drew closer. With this success, imbalances have also
appeared. On the demand side, growth has been maintained by the nexus of consumption
growth, rising real wages, and declining unemployment (text figure). High growth may,
however, be unsustainable if rising wages erode international competitiveness. The inflation

the forces integrating Lithuanian product and capital markets with those of Europe, broad,
anticipatory measures are needed.

wage growth accelerated to an annual rate of 15¼ percent. Because labor productivity has
been growing at about 5½ percent a year, unit labor costs are now rising at their fastest rate
in recent years.

Inflation has risen since Lithuania’s unsuccessful application for euro adoption.
In December 2006, average annual inflation was 3.8 percent, up from 2.7 percent in March
2006, when Lithuania applied for euro adoption (text figure). Though the expected rise in
energy prices failed to materialize (as oil prices fell during the third quarter of 2006), food

Despite the decline in the capital adequacy ratio from earlier in the decade,
financial buffers appear sufficient to cover nonsystemic risks. Following the high rate of
credit growth, the ratio of capital to risk-weighted assets declined steadily, reaching
9¾ percent in June. However, at the urging of the supervisory authority, injection of capital
has raised this ratio, which currently stands at 10¾ percent (text figure and Table 5).

stress tests, undertaken by the authorities, confirm that this would also be the case for
systemically important banks (see also accompanying selected issues paper). Also, domestic
banks are adopting best practices in risk management, reflecting the methods of their
reputed parent banks, who have an incentive to protect their high credit ratings.

The 2006 current account deficit widened significantly. The deficit widened by
about 5 percentage points of GDP, compared with a year earlier, to 12¼ percent of GDP
(Figure 2). The decline in

ongoing. However, staff estimates suggest that the effective exchange rate may be
approximately in equilibrium.1 Nevertheless, rising unit labor costs are a concern and were,
hence, the focus in the consultation.
8.
While markets have financed growing external liabilities at historically low
rates, continuation of such financing cannot be presumed. FDI inflows (about
5½ percent of GDP) were boosted by the government’s partial sale of the oil refinery to a
Polish buyer, and EU funds contributed a further 1¼ percent of GDP. Some of the proceeds
from the shares of the oil refinery were used to raise reserves, which increased to 57 percent
of short-term debt in December 2006, up from 46 percent a year earlier. As such, the stock
of gross external debt reached 56 percent of GDP at end-December 2006, up from
49 percent of GDP a year earlier (Table 6).
III. POLICY DISCUSSIONS
9.
The discussions centered on the size, timing, and political feasibility of
precautionary measures. Staff commended the authorities for continued efforts to secure
the health of the economy. But staff also cautioned that the incipient imbalances needed to
be taken seriously and stressed, in particular, that rising wages could compromise
competitiveness, thereby slowing growth and heightening financial vulnerability. The
authorities acknowledged staff’s cautionary advice but maintained that, with its strong
foundations, the economy should continue to perform well and withstand a wide range of
shocks. In contrast to staff’s call for early and ambitious steps to contain emerging
vulnerabilities, they viewed more measured responses as appropriate and politically
feasible. In this light, the discussions centered on four areas: (a) fiscal consolidation to
prevent a hard landing from the recent buoyancy and to contain inflation; (b)
complementary tax and expenditure reforms for medium-term fiscal sustainability; (c)
containment of possible financial vulnerabilities; and (d) structural measures to moderate
wages and enhance productivity to preserve competitiveness.

1

To stabilize net foreign liabilities (at the currently modest 48 percent of GDP), a real depreciation of about
3-5 percent appears necessary, and less if EU funds and remittances increase.

Lithuania: Fund Policy Recommendations and Implementation
Status of Implementation

payments) is, as recommended by staff, expected to be lower by about

consultation.

A. Outlook
10.
The growth outlook—a combination of the convergence process and some
exuberance—is characterized by uncertainty. Either potential growth has been
underestimated or the “extra”—above-potential—growth is due to a temporary reinforcing
dynamic of rapid consumption growth, wage acceleration, and falling unemployment rates.
Such a dynamic cannot continue indefinitely because it will erode international
competitiveness. However, it is hard to predict when the exuberance will subside.
11.
The discussions centered on two scenarios, hinging on how labor market,
especially wage, developments play out. If wage pressures prove to be temporary or are
resisted by employers,

the current account deficit at (or above) 13 percent of GDP. The risk of a further fall into a
prolonged slump, as in Portugal, could not then be ruled out. Weakening growth would
worsen the fiscal position. The high current account deficit would restrict fiscal policy
options to reverse the slump.
12.
The authorities placed a low probability on the less benign scenario. In particular,
they viewed the most recent wage acceleration as due to one-off factors. These include a
10 percent increase in the minimum wage in July 2006, a 40 percent rise in salaries in the
public health sector, and full payment of wage arrears to civil servants in June 2006. Also,
they judged that the tax inspectorate’s drive to increase personal income tax (PIT) and valueadded tax (VAT) revenues had raised officially declared wages more than actual take-home
pay of workers. At the same time, the data suggest that net emigration may have declined, as
fewer people appear to have left in 2006 than in 2005 and there has been more immigration.
Staff agreed that these factors were relevant for wage projections. While some wage
moderation could occur, policies to dampen domestic demand would reinforce such selfcorrection.

movements), could bring Lithuania close to the Maastricht reference inflation rate and,
hence, in a position to try for euro adoption once again. However, they agreed that wage
growth and the catch-up to European levels (Box 1) will keep upward pressure on prices.
Box 1. Price Convergence in Lithuania
Lithuania has achieved rapid income catch-up with a relatively slow pace
of price catch-up—but that balance may be changing. Especially in 2003, price
catch-up pressures were mitigated by one-off effects such as telecommunications
privatization and nominal effective exchange rate appreciation. As these factors recede,
the quantitative influence of price catch-up may become more prominent.

B. Fiscal Policy
14.
The 2007 budget implies a significant fiscal impulse. The fiscal stimulus from
fiscal operations (including

in the cyclically adjusted general government balance (including restitution payments).

11
15.
To prevent further fueling of the recent exuberance, staff recommended fiscal
consolidation to eliminate the projected 2007 stimulus. Under current projections, this
would require a fiscal consolidation of 2 percent of GDP in 2007, leading to a headline
surplus of about ¾ percent of GDP (including restitution payments). A somewhat less
ambitious objective could be to balance the headline budget in 2007. Either choice of frontloaded consolidation to reduce macroeconomic imbalances should be integral to a mediumterm objective of a structurally balanced budget by 2009, implying a consolidation of about
3 percent of GDP over three years. Fiscal consolidation would require use of all revenue
overperformance for deficit reduction as well as expenditure restraint. In the spirit of the
recent multiparty agreement, staff urged the authorities not to adopt a supplemental budget in
mid-2007. Further consolidation of employee positions in the public sector remained an
avenue for savings on the general government wage bill. Short-term expenditure moderation
could also be achieved in goods and services.
16.
Staff noted four benefits from early fiscal consolidation. First, cooling of the
economy by balancing the budget in 2007 would help reduce the current account deficit
immediately (text

Second, if a competitiveness-induced slump nevertheless materialized, the preemptive
consolidation would allow for future stabilizing options. Third, while the links between fiscal
policy and inflation are weak, a precautionary strategy, nevertheless, would contain the risk
that inflation would be amplified through second-round price effects. Finally, continuing
long-term pressures on the budget implied that creating fiscal space was important. As
discussed in last year’s staff report (IMF Country Report No. 06/162), skilled and
semiskilled emigration would add to the burden of the pension system and the costs of health
care. Space was also needed to narrow Lithuania’s tax wedge, which the authorities
recognized as a priority.2 Without additional fiscal space, calls for a reduction of the PIT rate
to 20 percent were untenable.

2

The PIT rate is to be reduced to 24 percent on January 1, 2008.

12
17.
The authorities reaffirmed their commitment to fiscal consolidation, but one
that was less front-loaded. They argued that they were committed to a structurally balanced
budget by 2010 in their convergence program. Since they placed a low probability on the
hard-landing scenario, the value of early fiscal consolidation as a precautionary policy
measure against macroeconomic imbalances appeared more than offset by the political cost
of such consolidation, especially because of their goal to complete restitution payments.
C. Tax and Expenditure Reform
18.
The authorities recognize that eliminating tax exemptions will broaden the base
and make the system fairer. A variety of exemptions are granted to support the weaker
sections of society but the benefits accrue in substantial measure to those who do not need
the support. The culture of granting exemptions is being increasingly legitimized, and the
pressure for further tax breaks appears set to exert a continuing influence on tax policy.
Staff suggested that the distributive concerns that partly motivate these pressures are more
effectively dealt with through the income tax. Also, a revenue gain from eliminating tax
exemptions of about 1½ percent of GDP appears possible.
19.
In tandem, a package of measures could increase after-tax incomes, especially of
low-income workers, and narrow the tax wedge in a broadly revenue-neutral manner.
To encourage labor participation of younger and less educated workers, reduce the size of the
informal sector, and provide targeted income support, an earned income tax credit (EITC)
was discussed (Box 2). Staff analysis suggests that this could be largely financed by reducing
the no-tax amount by about one-fourth from its current level. Because high-income
individuals also benefit from the no-tax amount, reducing its level would raise significant
revenues without unduly increasing disincentives to work. Separately, since social security
benefits are capped, a cap on contributions to the pension plan at a suitable earnings level
would be fair and would narrow the tax wedge at higher income levels. The budgetary
implications would be contained, as employers’ savings would raise corporate tax receipts
and as independent workers would be brought more fully under the social security system.

13

Box 2. Earned Income Tax Credit
The EITC rewards labor force participation by providing cash payments or a tax
rebate to low-income earners. Because the EITC is means-tested, it targets low-wage
workers more effectively than general reductions in income tax rates. The
accompanying selected issues paper shows an illustrative tax credit scenario in which
the lowest qualifying income earners would receive a cash payment of LTL 100 per
month, about one additional monthly salary per year. This cash payment would
decrease, and eventually disappear, as the household’s earned income rises to, say,
LTL 1000 per month. To finance these tax breaks, a reduction in the no-tax amount by
about one-fourth to LTL 280 per month would yield additional revenues of about
1 percent of GDP. Such a system, while adding to the complexity of the PIT
administration, would be fairer and more efficient (and ultimately simpler) than the
current tax and benefit system, which deals with social pressures through exemptions.

20.
The authorities pointed to some progress in the design of a Fiscal Responsibility
Act (FRA). The authorities agreed that the expenditure efficiency measures proposed in the
2006 Article IV consultation could prove valuable but noted their implementation needed
strong political support. However, they see recent multiparty agreement as a precursor to an
FRA. This agreement includes setting aside revenue overperformance for deficit reduction.
Together with the established practice of seeking new revenue sources for additional
spending initiatives, the authorities and staff agreed that further fiscal safeguards would
constitute steps forward. These would include ensuring greater budget transparency and
independent scrutiny of the budgeting process, possibly by enhancing the role of the State
Audit Office and establishing expert reviews of the demand impact of fiscal policy. A more
ambitious medium-term expenditure framework would include better integration of strategic
expenditure planning and budgeting and greater scrutiny of the expenditure plans of line
ministries and municipalities.

14
D. Financial Vulnerabilities
21.
The Bank of Lithuania (BoL) continues to view the financial system as stable—
as does staff (text table). Though the results of the diagnostic stress tests are reassuring,
there remains the task of guarding against systemic risk arising from a macroeconomic
slowdown. The concern is that exuberance may have encouraged poor credit decisions,
which will be revealed as such growth slows. The magnitude of macroeconomic stress, with
or without a significant price correction in real estate, is hard to assess. Nevertheless, further
efforts to model macroeconomic risks, including in conjunction with the forthcoming
Financial Sector Assessment Program (FSAP) update mission later this year, should provide
useful estimates of the effects of such shocks.
Lithuania: Risks to the Financial System and Mitigating Factors
Risks

Mitigating Factors

Rapid credit growth lowers lending standards,
especially for household lending.

Credit-GDP ratio is 44 percent of GDP, relative to
the 68 percent estimated as equilibrium by
Cottarelli and others (2003); households’
indebtedness is relatively low. 1/

A collapse of the house price “bubble” will hurt
banks’ balance sheets and depress consumption
and growth, with spillover effects on other
banking assets.

Mortgage lending carries relatively low risk in
normal circumstances. Moreover, it helps banks
achieve a desirable portfolio diversification.

Significant reliance on external borrowing to
expand credit creates the risk that parent banks
may suddenly stop this flow, leading to a credit
crunch and further knock-on effects.

Parent banks face significant reputation risk in
discontinuing support for subsidiaries and
branches. Especially compared with their typically
low exposure in the Baltics, these reputational
risks are large.

to the Private Sector in Central and Eastern Europe and in the Balkans”, IMF Working Paper,
No. 03/213.

22.
The authorities and staff agreed that continued active supervision of banks and
wide information disclosure are called for. The considerable variance in the strength and
performance of banks implies the continued need for supervisory efforts to identify bankspecific capital requirements and raise them where needed, as in the past. The authorities
have taken steps recently to maintain the integrity of the banking system by raising bank
capitalization, as noted above. The authorities also noted their ongoing efforts to facilitate
supervisory and crisis management cross-border arrangements, which include the recently
concluded agreement with the Swedish Riksbank, the Bank of Latvia, and the Bank of
Estonia. Staff welcomed steps to increase information disclosure by January 1, 2008 under
pillar 3 of Basel II.
E. Structural Measures
23.
Perhaps the most important goal, that of raising productivity, is also the most
difficult to induce reliably through policy measures. Lithuania has done well in past years
to improve its investment climate and ranks high on most measures of doing business

15
(Figure 5). Nevertheless, raising investment levels—including by attracting foreign
investors—will require further improvements in the investment climate. In addition to the
fiscal reforms discussed above, land and labor markets, as well as government services,
deserve attention. In the labor market, restrictions on overtime and part-time work and on
individual agreements on work hours and holidays limit the flexibility of small- and mediumscale production. Enhancing flexibility is important since a quick response to changing
European demand is key to maintaining the competitive advantage of Lithuanian producers.
Also, to alleviate labor market pressures, an important challenge for the authorities is to
creatively explore the possibilities of migration of labor into Lithuania. The land restitution
program introduced uncertainty in property rights, but even when it is completed, these
uncertainties are likely to persist on account of cumbersome land-planning processes. Also,
frequent and overlapping inspections of compliance with regulatory standards by government
institutions create a burden for business. The government’s plans to rationalize these
regulatory services are therefore welcome.
24.
The authorities are pursuing a new balance between prudence and flexibility to
better absorb EU funds. Lithuania’s utilization of structural funds stood close to the CEE-8
average at end-2006 (text figure). The current framework, designed to prevent the misuse of
EU grants, although commendable, causes delays. The authorities’ plans involve, first, a riskbased approach to verifying

come in tandem with stronger
coordination. This implied an
enhanced role for the Ministry of Finance in project selection to ensure consistency between
its decision-making powers and accountability before the European Commission. However,
the implementation capacity of the line ministries needed strengthening. Finally, staff
suggested that the carryover of unused cofinancing appropriations within so-called special
programs should be limited to increase the incentives of line ministries for more accurate
budgeting and timely implementation of EU projects.
IV. STAFF APPRAISAL
25.
Lithuania’s economic prospects remain bright, but early precautionary
measures could ensure that progress is not derailed. The income catch-up potential
remains large and the Lithuanian economy has demonstrated resilience to shocks and the
ability to climb the technology and quality ladder. Growth, however, has been boosted by a

16
rapid increase in consumption, helped by wage acceleration and a falling unemployment rate.
If wage growth continues to outpace productivity growth, competitiveness will be eroded, as
the international experience shows. In a competitiveness-induced slump (with a weak fiscal
position and a large current account deficit), policy options are limited. At the same time, the
inflation rate has picked up and euro adoption in 2009 or 2010 remains a close call. To
achieve sustainable growth and raise the prospects of euro adoption, precautionary measures
in four areas are, therefore, desirable: fiscal consolidation; tax and expenditure reforms;
containment of financial vulnerabilities; and structural measures to moderate wages and
enhance productivity.
26.
Fiscal consolidation should be appropriately ambitious. The authorities should not
rely on market-based self-correction of the exuberance. A front-loaded consolidation should
be integral to a medium-term objective of a structurally balanced budget by 2009. These
efforts would help cool the economy, contain the macroeconomic imbalances, improve the
prospects of euro adoption, and increase future policy flexibility (both to deal with a cyclical
contraction and to make space for long-term fiscal pressures).
27.
A variety of tax, expenditure, and procedural fiscal reforms will help fiscal
sustainability and accountability. Eliminating existing exemptions will broaden the tax
base and make the tax system fairer. Instead, implementing an earned income tax credit will
help enhance the simplicity and efficiency of the tax system and benefit system, and raise the
after-tax incomes of low-wage earners. Capping the value of contributions to the pension
plan at a suitable earnings level will narrow the tax wedge at the higher end of the wage
spectrum, and improve competitiveness in the international high-skilled labor market, while
maintaining broad revenue neutrality. On the expenditure side, considerable scope exists for
improving efficiency in social assistance and health delivery. Greater accountability can be
achieved through a more ambitious medium-term expenditure framework, embedded in the
framework of the Fiscal Responsibility Act. In turn, this act should include measures to
enhance transparency, independent scrutiny of the budgeting process, public analysis of the
macroeconomic impact of the budget and of expenditure efficiency, and a firm commitment
to fiscal restraint.
28.
While financial buffers appear sufficient to cover nonsystemic risks, the
authorities must maintain their efforts to contain financial vulnerabilities. The FSAP
update later this year will further examine these issues and delve also into the more difficult
assessment of the risks from a macroeconomic slowdown, including through a correction in
the real estate prices. Meanwhile, the considerable variance in the strength and performance
of banks implies the continued need for supervisory efforts to identify bank-specific capital
requirements and raise them where necessary, as in the past.
29.
Though much progress has been achieved, further improvements in the
investment climate will help raise investment levels. Among the priorities should be
permitting greater scope for flexible work arrangements, exploring possibilities of migration
of labor into Lithuania, reducing uncertainties in rights to land property, and streamlining the
assessment of business’ compliance with regulatory standards.
30.
The authorities’ plans to improve the absorption of EU funds are welcome. The
authorities’ plans to simplify claim verification and procurement regulations, particularly

17
where projects are small, are consistent with practices elsewhere in the region. With this
greater flexibility, the role of the Ministry of Finance in project selection should be enhanced
to ensure accountability.
31.
It is proposed that the next Article IV consultation be held on the standard 12-month
cycle.

Notes: Banking system data was compiled by aggregating banks solo (i.e. no cross-border cross-sector consolidation) data. No
intra-sector adjustments were made. At the present date, the discrepancy between consolidated and unconsolidated data is minor, but
unconsolidated data is available on a more timely basis. FSIs were mostly derived from supervisory data and comprise all banks and foreign
bank branches, incorporated in Lithuania.
1/ Without foreign bank branches.
2/ Capital is defined as banks shareholders' equity and foreign bank branches funds received from the head office.
3/ From end-2005 FSI is Nonperforming loans to capital.
4/ Net income before extraordinary items and taxes.
5/ Large exposure - means loans granted to the borrower the net value of which equals to, or exceeds, 10 per cent of bank capital that is
calculated having regard to the national Rules for Calculating Capital Adequacy. In this particular case Loan - means all bank’s monetary
claims to the borrower, acquired shares (contributions or other portions of equity), reflected in the bank balance-sheet and off-balance sheet
items, also monetary obligations of the bank recognised in the bank’s off-balance.
6/ Excluding loans and deposits to / from credit and financial institutions.
7/ Composition of liquid assets and current liabilities is defined in the Liquidity Ratio Calculation Rules approved by Resolution No. 1 of
the Board of the Bank of Lithuania of 29 January 2004.
8/ Information is based on interbank deals of all maturities (mostly overnights) made between resident banks in national currency Litas within the last
quarter of the period.
9/ From 2005, the major part of foreign currency loans and foreign currency liabilities are in Euros.
10/ From end-2005, NPLs are loans with payments on which are overdue more than 60 days. Until 2004 NPLs are loans in Substandard, Doubtful
and Loss loans categories.
11/ Credit registry data from 2005, therefore, it is considered as estimate of actual sectoral distribution.
12/ As defined in Rules for Calculation of Capital Adequacy approved by Bank of Lithuania Board Resolution No. 172 of 21 December 2000.

1/ The projections of the stock of external debt were substantially revised upward between the 2005 Article IV consultation and the 2006 Article IV consultation.
2/ Derived as [r - g - r(1+g) + ea(1+r)]/(1+g+r+gr) times previous period debt stock, with r = nominal effective interest rate on external debt; r = change in domestic GDP deflator in US dollar
terms, g = real GDP growth rate, e = nominal appreciation (increase in dollar value of domestic currency), and a = share of domestic-currency denominated debt in total external debt.
3/ The contribution from price and exchange rate changes is defined as [-r(1+g) + ea(1+r)]/(1+g+r+gr) times previous period debt stock. r increases with an appreciating domestic currency
(e > 0) and rising inflation (based on GDP deflator).
4/ For projection, line includes the impact of price and exchange rate changes.
5/ Defined as current account deficit, plus amortization on medium- and long-term debt, plus short-term debt at end of previous period.
6/ The key variables include real GDP growth; nominal interest rate; dollar deflator growth; and both non-interest current account and non-debt inflows in percent of GDP.
7/ Long-run, constant balance that stabilizes the debt ratio assuming that key variables (real GDP growth, nominal interest rate, dollar deflator growth, and non-debt inflows in percent
of GDP) remain at their levels of the last projection year.

Anti-money laundering and combating financing of terrorism: In 2006, MONEYVAL
evaluated Lithuania's anti-money laundering (AML) and combating the financing of terrorism
(CFT) system and concluded that the system was quite sound on paper; however, the report
raised questions about the implementation of AML/CFT measures. A draft law on the Prevention
of Money Laundering has been circulated to the relevant authorities for their comments.

ANNEX II. LITHUANIA: STATISTICAL ISSUES
Over the past several years, Lithuania has made good progress in establishing a
macroeconomic database. Official data for all sectors are generally of sufficiently good
quality to support economic analysis.
Lithuania subscribed to the Special Data Dissemination Standard (SDDS) in May 1996, and
its metadata have been posted on the Fund’s Dissemination Standards Bulletin Board
(DSBB) since April 1997. Lithuania meets the SDDS specifications for coverage, periodicity
and timeliness of the data, and for the dissemination of the advance release calendars. A
significant amount of information is now available on various websites through the Internet
(see section on Dissemination of Statistics, below). A ROSC data module was published in
November 2002.
National Accounts
The national accounts are compiled by Statistics Lithuania (SL) (the former Department of
Statistics) in accordance with the guidelines of the European System of Accounts 1995 (ESA
95). Quarterly GDP estimates at current and at constant prices are compiled both from the
production and expenditure approaches. GDP estimates by production are considered to be
more reliable than the corresponding estimates by expenditure, but no statistical
discrepancies between these two estimates are shown in the published figures as the
discrepancies are included in the estimates of changes in inventories. In general, good data
sources and sound methods are used, for the compilation of the national accounts, but
difficulties remain in measuring the economic activity of the informal sector. These latter
estimates are compiled at detailed levels of economic activity using fixed coefficients
derived from a benchmark survey conducted in 1996. The base year for the fixed price series
was changed to 2000 in early 2003.
Price Data
Since December 1998, CPI weights have been updated annually. The monthly CPI is
available in the second week following the reference month. The producer price index is
calculated according to the chain-linked Laspeyres formula with weights updated every year.

7

Public Finance
Data on the central government budget execution are available quarterly, although these data
are subject to frequent revisions. The ongoing treasury project is expected to improve fiscal
data quality substantially. However, further work is needed to clarify the treatment of public
health care providers and of EU transactions, and the consolidation procedure for
government operations. A new classification, incorporating the GFSM2001 was approved in
mid-2003. Since then, the MoF has been reporting to STA general government’s annual data
on an accrual and cash basis (except for local governments, which are still on a cash basis)
for publication in the Government Finance Statistics Yearbook (GFSY).
Money and Banking
The Bank of Lithuania (BoL) reports monetary and financial statistics (MFS) to STA on a
timely and regular basis. The scope, concepts and definitions of the MFS are broadly in line
with the guidelines of the Monetary and Financial Statistics Manual (MFSM). In compliance
with the ECB requirements on pre-accession countries, the BoL’s Banking and Monetary
Statistics Division generally follows ECB regulations (1995 ESA) on sectorization, valuation
and classification of financial instruments.
External Sector
The BoL is responsible for compiling balance of payments, international investment position
(IIP), external debt and international reserves statistics. The BoL reports quarterly data on
balance of payments, IIP and monthly international reserves to STA on a timely and regular
basis. Balance of payments data (on a monthly and quarterly basis) are compiled using the
format recommended in the Balance of Payments Manual, fifth edition (BPM5). The monthly
data correspond to several key balance of payments components, compiled on the basis of a
sample survey covering the public sector, commercial banks, and some nonfinancial private
sector institutions. The Data Template on International Reserves and Foreign Currency
Liquidity is disseminated monthly according to the operational guidelines and is hyperlinked
to the Fund’s DSBB. Since late 2004, the BoL disseminates quarterly external debt data in
the World Bank’s Quarterly External Debt Statistics (QEDS) database.
Dissemination of Statistics
The authorities publish a range of economic statistics through a number of publications,
including the SL's monthly publication, Economic and Social Developments, and the BoL's
monthly Bulletin. A significant amount of data are available on the Internet:
•

Lithuania’s metadata for data categories defined by the Special Data Dissemination
Standard are posted on the IMF’s DSBB (http://dsbb.imf.org);

8

•

the BoL website (http://www.lb.lt) provides data on monetary statistics, treasury bill
auction results, balance of payments, IIP, external debt and other main economic
indicators;

•

the SL website (http://www.stat.gov.lt) provides monthly and quarterly information
on economic and social development indicators;

•

the MoF (http://www.finmin.lt) home page includes data on the national budget, as
well as information on laws and privatization; and

•

the Vilnius Stock Exchange website (http://www.lt.omxgroup.com.?lang=en) has
information on stock trading.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
April 3, 2007

International Monetary Fund
700 19th Street, NW
Washington, D. C. 20431 USA

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2007 Article IV Consultation with the
Republic of Lithuania
On March 26, 2007, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded
the Article IV consultation with the Republic of Lithuania.1
Background
The catch-up in per capita income toward the European average, underpinned by robust
productivity growth, has been impressive. With this success, however, imbalances have also
appeared. On the demand side, growth has been maintained by the nexus of consumption
growth, rising real wages, and declining unemployment. Recent growth rates of 7½ percent may
be unsustainable if rising wages erode international competitiveness. The annual average
inflation rate has picked up to 3¾ percent and will likely remain above the Maastricht reference
value as long as demand pressures continue and prices converge to European levels.
The fiscal stance has added to demand pressures. Strong revenue overperformance
contributed to a small narrowing of the general government deficit on a cyclically adjusted basis.
However, when the impact of EU funds is included, the aggregate of government and EUrelated operations continued to provide an economic stimulus of ½ percent of GDP in 2006.
The current account deficit widened significantly to 12¼ percent of GDP in 2006. The principal
cause was rapid growth in nominal imports, but production shortfalls at the oil refinery also
1

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On
return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the
Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the
Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the
country's authorities.

2
contributed to the widening deficit. Nevertheless, export performance was strong with rising
export market share and a continued switch from low- to medium-technology goods. FDI inflows
(about 5½ percent of GDP) were boosted by the government’s partial sale of the oil refinery and
EU funds financed a further 1¼ percent of GDP of the current account deficit. Reserves
increased to 57 percent of short-term debt in December 2006.
Despite continued rapid credit growth, buffers in the financial system appear sufficient to cover
bank-specific risks. Banks’ capital adequacy ratio has increased to 10¾ percent of risk-weighted
assets following capital injections in late 2006. Nonperforming loans have modestly increased to
1 percent of total loans at end-2006, but the deterioration was of a nonsystemic nature.
Aggregate stress tests indicate that a three-to-five-fold increase in nonperforming loans would
not reduce the banking system’s capital below the regulatory minimum.
Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors welcomed the continued bright prospects of the Lithuanian economy, its
potential for income catchup with other EU countries, its resilience to shocks, and its ability to
climb the technology and quality ladder.
Directors noted that early precautionary measures could ensure that the substantial progress
made so far is preserved. GDP growth has been maintained by the nexus of consumption
growth, rising real wages, and falling unemployment. Directors expressed concern that the high
rate of growth may be unsustainable, if wage increases outpace productivity growth and
undermine international competitiveness. Pointing to rising inflation, Directors cautioned that
euro adoption in 2009 or 2010 remains uncertain, and advised adoption of a more precautionary
stance in four areas: fiscal consolidation; tax and expenditure reforms; measures to further
strengthen the financial sector; and structural measures to moderate wage growth and enhance
productivity growth.
Directors generally recommended a more ambitious fiscal adjustment, with most advocating a
front-loaded fiscal consolidation, combined with a move to medium-term structural balance.
Such a consolidation would help cool the economy, contain macroeconomic imbalances,
improve prospects of euro adoption, and increase future policy flexibility.
Directors advised a variety of tax, expenditure, and procedural fiscal reforms to enhance fiscal
sustainability and accountability. They noted that eliminating tax exemptions—which currently
accrue in substantial measure to those who do not need support—would broaden the tax base
and make the tax system fairer. Consideration could also be given to an earned income tax
credit, which if properly designed, could enhance the simplicity and efficiency of the tax and
social benefit system, while better targeting income support to low-income families. Directors
reiterated the need for improving expenditure efficiency in the social sector, especially health
care and the social benefit system. Directors welcomed the authorities’ plans to introduce a
Fiscal Responsibility Act (FRA), especially if it includes greater budget transparency and
scrutiny of the budgeting process. They recommended that a more ambitious medium-term
expenditure framework be embedded into any FRA.

3
Directors agreed that buffers in the financial system appear sufficient to cover nonsystemic
risks. Nevertheless, they expected the Financial Sector Assessment Program update in late
2007 to provide further analysis of the effects on the financial sector of a macroeconomic
slowdown, including a correction in the real estate market. Directors also cautioned that the
variance in the strength and performance of banks requires continued vigilance in supervision.
Directors noted that further improvements in the business climate are needed to increase
investment. These should focus on strengthening labor market flexibility, clarifying land property
rights and land use procedures, and streamlining assessments of business compliance with
regulatory standards.
Directors praised the authorities’ plans to enhance the absorption of EU funds. They noted that
the planned simplification of claim verification and procurement regulation, especially for small
projects, is in line with practices in other countries in the region. Complementing these
measures with an enhanced role of the Ministry of Finance in project selection would increase
accountability.

Public Information Notices (PINs) form part of the IMF's efforts to promote transparency of the IMF's
views and analysis of economic developments and policies. With the consent of the country
(or countries) concerned, PINs are issued after Executive Board discussions of Article IV consultations
with member countries, of its surveillance of developments at the regional level, of post-program
monitoring, and of ex post assessments of member countries with longer-term program engagements.
PINs are also issued after Executive Board discussions of general policy matters, unless otherwise
decided by the Executive Board in a particular case. The staff report (use the free Adobe Acrobat
Reader to view this pdf file) for the 2007 Article IV Consultation with Lithuania is also available.
