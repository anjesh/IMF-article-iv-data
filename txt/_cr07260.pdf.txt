Euro Area Policies: 2007 Article IV Consultation—Staff Report; Staff Supplement;
Public Information Notice on the Executive Board Discussion; and Statement by the
Executive Director for Member Countries
Under Article IV of the IMF’s Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. In the context of the 2007 Article IV consultation with member
countries forming the euro area, the following documents have been released and are included in this
package:
•

The staff report on euro area policies (including the trade policies of the European Union),
prepared by a staff team of the IMF, following discussions that ended on June 4, 2007, with
the officials at EU institutions in the context of the Article IV consultations with countries
forming the euro area. Based on information available at the time of these discussions, the
staff report was completed on July 10, 2007. The views expressed in the staff report are those
of the staff team and do not necessarily reflect the views of the Executive Board of the IMF.

•

A staff supplement of July 20, 2007 updating information on recent developments.

•

A Public Information Notice (PIN) summarizing the views of the Executive Board as
expressed during its July 25, 2007 discussion of the staff report that concluded the Article IV
consultation.

•

A statement by the Executive Director for Germany, on behalf of the euro-area Member
States and the European Community.

EURO AREA POLICIES
Staff Report for the 2007 Article IV Consultation with Member Countries
Prepared by the European Department
Approved by Michael Deppler and Michael Hadjimichael
July 10, 2007
EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
There was broad agreement between staff and authorities on most issues. The main points are
as follows:
•

The outlook is the best in years. The economy is poised for a sustained upswing, partly
because of cyclical considerations, but also because of policies, which have up to now
had a forward-looking cast. The area’s external position and the real effective
exchange rate of the euro are within range of medium-term equilibrium.

•

Stabilizing inflation below 2 percent might well require a further gradual tightening of
monetary policy.

•

Fiscal outturns and policies have been strong, and intentions are for this to continue;
but there are concerns that past accomplishments together with benign prospects will
prompt some letting down of the guard, particularly in countries still some distance
from their medium-term objectives.

•

With structural policies representing the area’s main contribution to an orderly
resolution of global imbalances, staff welcomed the renewed impetus behind the
Lisbon Agenda. Labor market developments continue to surprise on the upside, but
much remains to be done to increase participation rates. Product market policies have
been moving into higher gear, but 50 years after the signing of the Treaty of Rome,
contestability in sheltered sectors remains problematic and is central to reversing the
weak performance of productivity.

•

Increased contestability and integration in the financial sector is also key to improving
performance, and significant initiatives to strengthen markets and the stability
framework to that end are underway, but how to proceed is controversial.

I. REPORT ON THE DISCUSSIONS
A. Cyclical Developments and Prospects
1.
The economy is moving from recovery to upswing and the fundamentals are
improving (Figure 1, Table 1). Real GDP growth is running around 2½ percent; fiscal
deficits are markedly lower than a few years ago; and strong export growth, improving
profitability and balance sheets, and accommodative financial conditions have fostered a
broad based upswing of investment and employment (Figures 2–4).
The recovery has been led by investment and exports.

The external setting is generally considered propitious. Specifically:

•

Import demand growth in partner countries is projected to slow down only
moderately, from about 7½ percent annually over the past couple of years to around
6½ percent through 2008.

•

The area’s external current account is broadly balanced and export growth has been
dynamic, notwithstanding the recent appreciation of the euro’s real effective
exchange rate (¶32).

•

Financial market volatility and risk premia remain historically low.

Accordingly, projections are for
growth around 2½ percent through 2008.
This represents a slowdown from the recent
pace, which was just over 3 percent over the
four quarters to 2006:Q4 and 2007:Q1. This
reflects the unwinding of the German VAT,
the tightening in macroeconomic policies
during 2006-07, and the fading of
exceptionally favorable export performances
observed in 2006.

The recovery is expected to continue.

developments include: (i) the deregulation-enabled shift of employment toward part-time and

(iii) high immigration; and (iv) less generous welfare.1

See IMF Country Report No. 04/235, Chapter I. Staff has marked up area-wide potential output growth
estimates from 1.8 percent for 2004 to 2.1 percent starting 2008—rates that are similar to those estimated by EC
and ECB staff—projecting that the output gap would close in 2008. Upward revisions mainly reflect higher
investment and capital stocks as well as growing labor force participation in response to improving employment
prospects.

5.
The risks to growth were generally seen to be small and to the upside in the
short run but widening and moving to the downside over the medium run. The external
risks were viewed as on the downside and increasing over time. They relate mainly to
renewed upward pressure on oil prices, a hard landing of the US economy, a malign
unwinding of global imbalances, and flight from risk. Domestic risks were seen to be on the
upside over the coming year but broadly balanced over the medium run. In the short run,
consumer spending could accelerate faster than anticipated, as consumer confidence is
relatively strong and employment and other conjunctural indicators are in expansionary
territory (Figure 7). Moreover, equity markets are more fairly valued and corporate balance
sheets stronger than at the peak of the previous boom. With emerging equipment capacity
constraints, investment could grow more than expected. Regarding the medium run,
household saving rates might stabilize rather than rise again in 2008, as assumed in WEO
projections. But there are also domestic medium-run weaknesses, notably those related to
stretched housing sectors and, to a lesser extent, insufficient competitiveness in some
significant parts of the area (Figure 8).
Risks to growth are tilted to the upside in the near term and downside over the long term.

While headline inflation has been
somewhat volatile, measures of
underlying inflationary pressures have
been inching up. Financial market-based
measures, analysts expectations, and
various indicators of underlying inflation
(core, trimmed means, etc.) have been
rising gradually since the troughs of 2005

(Figure 9). The euro-area headline HICP has been running just under the 2 percent threshold.

provide ground for higher pay, notably in
Germany where compensation had been exceptionally subdued. With firms already wellplaced to increase margins somewhat further, cost increases would likely translate into price
increases as well.
8.
Looking ahead, the central view
was therefore that underlying inflation
would gradually firm. Staff and ECB
forecasts are for HICP inflation hovering
around 2 percent through 2008, implying that
an acceleration in costs would make up for
the unwinding of the effect of the VAT on
year-on-year inflation. Staff models point to
roughly balanced risks (Figure 11), although
fully capturing upside risks related to
indirect taxes as well as administrative and
oil prices with these models is difficult. The
ECB put greater emphasis on the upside
risks, including those related to wages and
ample liquidity. Credit to nonfinancial
corporations is increasing rapidly but that to
households, notably for mortgages, is
slowing down noticeably, suggesting that

past rate hikes are feeding through (Figures 12–13).2 Nonetheless, M3 continues to expand at
a brisk pace (lately increasingly on account of less liquid components), although its recent
dynamism may currently overstate somewhat the robust underlying rate of monetary
expansion, according to ECB staff. Fund staff is skeptical about M3 as an indicator of shortto medium-run inflation.3
9.
Some further monetary policy action is likely to be necessary. As expected,
following the mission the ECB raised rates to 4 percent on June 6, 2007, and markets foresee
rates just under 4½ percent by the end of this year. Concurrently, long-term interest rates
have moved up noticeably as of late, implying some tightening of monetary conditions. With
the area's growth projected to remain close to or above potential, and the possibility of some
further upward pressure on factor utilization and prices, staff thought that (aside from global
inflation trends) the scope and timing of further action would need to depend on (i) the extent
to which reforms and demographics have improved labor supply; (ii) the extent to which the
incipient acceleration of productivity is structural or cyclical; and (iii) the evolving
distribution of (mainly demand-side) risks––including those related to the exchange rate
(¶32)––to activity further out, which are presently seen to be on the downside.
C. Fiscal Policy: Adjusting During the Upswing
10.
Fiscal policy surprised on
the upside in 2006. Standard
measures suggest that the area’s
cyclically-adjusted fiscal deficit
fell by almost 1 percentage point of
GDP in 2006––exceeding staff’s
½ percent of GDP benchmark for
countries at a significant distance
from their medium-term objectives
(MTO). This was led by large
reductions in Germany, France,
and (upon considering the
expiration of one-off measures),
Italy. Other EDP countries have
also met their commitments and,
more generally, higher-thanbudgeted revenues have been
allocated to debt reduction, even if
not to the full extent by all countries.

Spurred by these strong outcomes and buoyant prospects, the Eurogroup
Ministers announced their intention to accelerate the consolidation of the area’s public
finances. Specifically, they committed to achieve their (country-specific) MTO at the latest
by 2010 and agreed, notwithstanding a still negative output gap according to agreed
measurement techniques, that “good times” prevail. Under the Stability Growth Pact (SGP)
rule book, this implies a commitment to adjust by more than ½ percent of GDP annually for
those countries that have not yet reached their MTO.
12.
There was agreement at staff levels, therefore, that the reformed SGP had
worked well thus far, but also concerns that the true test of its preventive arm still lay
ahead. The challenges remain sizeable, particularly in some countries. Despite progress
under the SGP’s dissuasive arm, cyclically-adjusted fiscal positions today are not appreciably
different from those attained in 2000. Moreover, recollections of the very large negative
corrections made ex post to the structural positions estimated for 2000 prompted caution
about relying unduly on current estimates. Indeed, there was agreement that the standard
cyclical adjustment might overstate the true structural adjustment that occurred in 2006
because it did not allow for the potential procyclicality of revenue elasticities. The shared
view was that, pending deeper analysis, it would be prudent to consider only about half of the
observed reduction in the deficit ratio as structural, a figure that is broadly consistent with
the decline in the cyclicallyEU: Aging-related Expenditure, 2004-2050

Staff therefore pressed for full adherence to the SGP’s norm of at least
½ percent of GDP adjustment per annum by countries that remained short of their
MTOs. On present budgetary plans, staff thought that little adjustment was in the offing
through 2008, particularly in some key countries, a concern that was shared by Commission
and ECB representatives (Figure 14). There was broad agreement that various institutions,
from independent ad-hoc committees to fiscal rules to medium-term expenditure budgeting
are useful means to overcome political economy distortions to fiscal policy, depending on a
country’s institutional setting. The Commission observed that euro-area countries were
making appreciable progress on this front, pointing to greater emphasis on medium-term
planning, spending rules, and enforcement mechanism in stability programs (SPs). Staff
welcomed these measures as they could help bring forward the credibility gains from
adopting complementary fiscal and structural policies, but noted that peer pressure within the
framework of the SGP would also need to play an important role.
D. Structural Policies: Integrating Europe and Raising Labor Utilization
Advancing economic integration in the currency union
14.
The currency union countries have been integrating rapidly since EMU but
structural reforms and more financial integration would help reduce remaining
country dispersions and alleviate their repercussions on households and firms. Areawide shocks now explain the bulk of growth and inflation developments in individual
member countries (Box 1), suggesting that the union has been integrating at considerable
speed. As a result, the share of shocks that is country-specific is no longer high by
international standards for currency unions. However, their persistence is still a concern,
partly explaining appreciable divergences in national competitiveness (Figure 6). There was
agreement that adjustments in national competitiveness needed to proceed more rapidly,
notably through wage flexibility, and that continued labor and product market reform was
critical to that effect. In addition, further financial integration could contribute to income
smoothing among EMU members.

12

Box 1. EMU Dispersions
Under EMU, common shocks explain a much larger portion of member countries’ output
and inflation developments than before, and the transmission of shocks has become

shocks to growth and inflation,
however, have a fairly large persistent component. Partly these shocks are driven by one-off
factors that take time to unwind, notably the EMU-related declines of interest rates and
increases in real estate valuations in various countries that featured high pre-EMU real interest
rates. Partly they reflect income and price convergence. These two developments are difficult
to account for separately, because the relatively less-wealthy countries were also those with
relatively high pre-EMU interest rates. Staff research suggest that they can account for a large
proportion of remaining country-specific shocks (see “Growth and Inflation Dispersions in
EMU: Reasons, the Role of Adjustment Channels, and Policy Implications,” forthcoming IMF
Working Paper).
Further integration of the financial system could increase risk sharing and income
smoothing in response to remaining country-specific shocks. Staff research suggests that the
financial system has played a role as a shock absorber however, it is still far from achieving its
full potential. The results indicate that its role for risks sharing has not increased substantially
over time. Findings in the literature suggest that the contribution of the financial sector to
income smoothing could be increased significantly—by up to 20 percentage points—if its level
of integration reached that of the United States.1/

Beyond reducing dispersions, all saw further market integration also as a boon
for euro-area productivity. Euro-area productivity compares well internationally on
tradables and poorly on nontradables, notably wholesale and retail trade and financial
services. Similarly, among EU countries those with less regulated product markets have
tended to post better growth performances over the past couple of decades, without
necessarily experiencing larger social inequities. Indeed, staff analysis suggests that
successful reformers focused on increasing labor supply through benefit reform and lowering
tax wedges and government consumption. Greater labor supply translated into employment
growth more effectively in the presence of liberal labor and product markets.6 There was
broad agreement among staff, EC, and ECB officials on the synergies between labor and
product market reform and hence on the benefits from eliminating remaining barriers to the

full integration of goods and services markets (Figure 15), including obstacles to foreign
entry. Accordingly, the discussions focused on the key EU policy initiatives that seek to
advance integration and market contestability, including the Lisbon Agenda, the Services
Directive, and the Financial Services Action Plan (EU FSAP).
The Lisbon Agenda and the Services Directive
16.
The implementation of the Lisbon Strategy is improving, as evidenced by the
renewed issuance of country-specific economic policy recommendations. The Strategy
was adopted by EU heads of state in 2000 to make Europe more dynamic and competitive
and relaunched in Spring 2005, after initially disappointing results. Some estimates put the
Lisbon Agenda’s growth impact at about ½–¾ percentage points of GDP over the medium

14
run. EC officials explained that aside from product, services, and financial market reform, as
well as R&D, priorities under the Strategy include several additional measures, notably
improving flexibility and security on labor markets as well as education and training. Within
these broad priorities, countries define their own National Reform Programs (NRP) that the
Commission evaluates, making recommendations that are submitted for endorsement by the
European Council.
17.
Staff argued NRP under the Lisbon Strategy still needed to better harness the
synergies between reforms and become more transparent. The NRP are helpful in
harnessing synergies between reforms that boost labor supply, which are typically nationallyled, and those that liberalize product and services markets, which are increasingly EU-led.
While there are some signs of progress, in the staff’s view, too many countries are still not
using the NRP to those effects and too many NRP are too vaguely specified to be
monitorable and hence as credible as they might be.
18.
The Commission countered that the Agenda had already fostered a closer
dialogue between Ministries within countries in designing NRP. Furthermore, work is
underway to improve the analysis of growth bottlenecks and their linkages to specific
structural reforms as well as the monitoring and quantification of such reforms. Commission
officials were particularly keen on improving coordination between national reforms and
Community-led initiatives, including areas covered by EU structural and social policies.
Staff agreed on the need for more coordination but pressed for the country-specific
recommendations to place greater emphasis on improving the monitorability and domestic
governance of NRP.
19.
Member states are to implement the Services Directive through national laws,
regulations, and administration by December 2009. The mission pressed for an early and
good faith implementation of the Directive (meaning no abuse of the its public interest
exemptions), which could be fostered by publishing country-specific transposition status
timetables and scheduling a formal mid-term review by the European Commission. The
liberalization of the services markets would also need to be extended to sectors not covered
by the Directive, notably professional services. Commission staff explained that the
transposition of the Directive would be a complex undertaking with different requirements
for different countries.
E. Financial Sector Integration and Stability
20.
Financial sector integration is a key avenue to boosting Europe’s growth
prospects. National accounts data suggest that: (i) about half of the euro area’s just under
1 percent annual productivity growth gap during 1996–2003 relative to the United States can
be traced back directly to the financial sector (excluding insurance); (ii) labor productivity in
business and financial services has been moving broadly sideways since 1993; and (iii) the

15
euro area is doing much better with respect to productivity in insurance, which at the level of
major financial institutions appears more European and global than banking. While
productivity data on financial services are not without problems, it is clear that the direct
growth benefits of integration may well be large; that indirect benefits, notably from
financial-sector-enabled restructuring and innovation, may be larger still; and that financial
integration will foster more cross-border risk sharing and a better pass-through of monetary
policy.
Banking is the least "Europeanized" of activities.

Services Action Plan (EU FSAP) and the
Lamfalussy process, with its several levels that focus on the development and
implementation of legislation. On the regulatory front, the policy achievements within this
framework are major: there has been much legislative and regulatory convergence, pushed
forward in particular by the 2006 Capital Requirements Directive (CRD) for banks and

16
investment firms, the forthcoming Solvency II Directive for insurance companies, and the
Markets in Financial Instruments Directive for financial markets. The key challenge is to
ensure the uniform implementation of the directives by national prudential authorities, which
is the responsibility of the Level 3 (committees of supervisors) and 4 (enforcement by the
Commission) of the Lamfalussy framework. Progress in this regard as well as with respect to
supervision and crisis prevention, management, and resolution is mixed, however.
Financial integration and development
22.
Major initiatives are underway to develop European capital markets and “armslength” finance as well as to promote retail market integration.
•

Transposition into national laws of the Markets in Financial Instruments Directive
(MiFID). This will radically reshape the investment services landscape in Europe and
has, for example, already led several major banks to plan a trading platform to
compete with domestic stock exchanges in Europe. MiFID establishes a
comprehensive regulatory regime for regulated financial markets, other trading
systems, and investment firms. It simplifies and extends the “single passport” system
for investment firms, enabling them to do business anywhere in the EU on the basis
of home-country authorization, with a minimum of red tape. The Directive also
enables investment firms to process client orders outside regulated markets. Overall,
the Directive is expected to lead to major changes in the architecture of capital
markets and financial intermediation in Europe both via increased competition and
faster technological change.7

•

Work is underway to integrate securities clearing and settlement systems, which is
central to integrating Europe’s capital markets. In particular, key post-trading
services providers signed a Code of Conduct in November 2006 committing them to
(i) price transparency; (ii) interoperability; and (iii) unbundling of services, by
January 2008. Progress will be monitored and, if deemed insufficient, could lead to
renewed work on a directive. Additionally, the ECB is evaluating opportunities to
provide efficient settlement services in central bank money for securities transactions,
processing securities and cash legs on a single platform (Target 2-Securities).

•

Other policy initiatives cover bank mergers and acquisitions; the integration of
payments systems (SEPA); retail products (e.g., mortgages, bank accounts); and
investment funds.

It will take some time before these and other initiatives yield their full benefits. The mission
welcomed the progress and encouraged work on converging national securitization markets.

Securitization can play a major role in developing capital markets, spreading risks, and
reducing economic divergences. It can also foster a more efficient, market-driven division of

banks. While concerned about rapid
growth of credit (especially in foreign currency) in various NMS, officials did not see
significant vulnerabilities for euro-area financial institutions as a whole.
24.
Financial indicators may have peaked, however. There are signs that the credit
cycle is gradually turning: nonfinancial corporate rating downgrades have been more
frequent than upgrades and leverage in parts of the corporate and household sectors may
have become excessive. Also, ECB analysis suggest that the vulnerability of the financial
system to an abrupt and unexpected loss of market liquidity appears to be increasing. Other
concerns are the external downside risks; the rising complexity of financial instruments; and,
to a lesser extent, the activities of highly leveraged nonbank financial institutions.8 EC and
ECB staff discounted worries about “subprime-like” mortgage products, a market that is far
less developed in Europe than in the United States. They thought that few of the large euroarea banks have significant direct exposures to subprime activity in the United States. EC
and ECB officials agreed on the desirability of stress testing to gauge potential cross-border

vulnerabilities in Europe but observed that differences in supervisory data and confidentiality
issues need to be addressed first. In the meantime, they implement less sophisticated stress
tests using publicly available data on financial products and large crossborder financial
institutions (LCFI). These had confirmed the robustness of the financial system.
25.
Turning to the stability framework, Europe has for years sought to establish the
right balance between the impulse to strengthen integration on the one hand and to
preserve national accountability for financial stability on the other. In 1993, the Second
Banking Directive introduced home-country control and mutual recognition, resulting in a
“single passport” that enabled any bank licensed in any EU country to open branches (not
subsidiaries) in other EU countries on the basis of its home license. However, branching
entails a loss of control of host countries over domestic financial stability, for which they
remain accountable, and often is less attractive than market entry via subsidiaries.
Accordingly, the single passport has not delivered a single “rules book” of prudential
policies and practices. A new impetus toward reform of the financial stability framework
came with the 1999 Financial Services Action Plan (FSAP), which had as one of its
objectives the introduction of state-of-the-art prudential rules and supervision. To support
this objective and pursue convergence of supervisory practices, the FSAP was complemented
with the Lamfalussy framework, a tiered process that relies on committees of national
supervisors to effect convergence of national rule books and practices. Combined, the FSAP
and Lamfalussy process have achieved major progress but less so in key areas, notably
crossborder crisis prevention, management, and resolution. In the meantime a number of
LCFI have begun to dominate the European banking landscape and crossborder
consolidation is accelerating, even though it remains behind other sectors of the euro-area
economy.9 As a result, the importance of crossborder bank linkages and the potential for
contagion among the major European banks are increasing (Box 2). Against this background,
the authorities have initiated various stock-taking exercises.
26.
The core problem, which is widely recognized, is that national authorities’
fiduciary responsibilities are toward national treasuries, and this limits their incentives
to work toward a common EU-wide stability framework. The dominant strategy for
supervisors in an LCFI crisis will likely be to look out for the national treasury, using
informational advantages to that effect, notwithstanding MoUs on information sharing and
cooperation. A scramble for assets in an LCFI crisis is thus likely and would have significant
crossborder spillovers, preventing efficient and effective crisis management and resolution.

9

ESCB work shows that some 46 LCFI hold about 68 percent of EU banking assets.

19

Box 2. Spillover Risks Among the Major European Union Banks
The scope for cross-border spillovers among the major European banks can be examined
using the Extreme Value Theory framework, which analyzes co-movements between
extreme events (“co-exceedances”), specifically the co-movement of extreme negative
(left-tail) realizations of banks’ soundness measures. The soundness measure chosen in
this analysis is the distance-to-default (DD), defined as the difference between the
expected value of assets at maturity and the default threshold, which is a function of the
value of the liabilities. A higher DD is associated with a lower probability of the bank’s
default. It is generally a useful proxy for default risk if stocks are traded in liquid
markets.
The DD for 27 of the largest European Union banking groups were computed for May
2000–April 2007 using daily stock price and annual balance sheet data. A binomial logit
model was used to estimate the probability of a bank experiencing a large negative DD
change in response to large negative shocks to the DD changes of other banks. Large
negative shocks were defined as those falling in the 10th percentile of the left tail of the
common distribution of the changes in the DD across all banks. Four control variables—
changes in the slope of the term structure, and the volatility of the domestic, regional and
world stock market indices—were also included in the model to account for common
factors affecting all EU banks.

2/ The number of significant links (in the previous line), in percent of all possible
contagion channels (i.e., as percent of all possible domestic and cross-border pairings
of banks, respectively).

The results (see table) suggest that although spillovers within domestic banking systems
generally remain more likely, the potential for extreme events to spill over from one bank
to another appears to have increased, both among domestic banks and across the border.
The number of significant cross-border links is already larger than the number of
significant links among domestic banks, adding another piece of empirical evidence
supporting the need for greater cross-border supervisory cooperation in the EU.

20
In this set-up, it is natural for national prudential authorities to fear loss of control over
domestically-active financial players. The desire to maintain control to better protect national
financial stability is a factor contributing to customization and “goldplating” of EU
directives, which risks delivering a collection of national rather than a single set of best EU
prudential policies and practices; opposition to a framework for systematic multilateral
supervisory data sharing;10 and, perhaps most importantly, a reluctance to agree to EU
principles and procedures for crossborder financial crisis prevention, management, and
resolution.
27.
While it is generally acknowledged that Europe’s financial stability framework
needs to be strengthened further, views differ considerably on priorities. Some
policymakers see a burden sharing agreement as the cornerstone of a reformed framework
and thus a natural entry point toward more joint responsibility. These representatives argue
that such an agreement is a condition for prudential authorities to fully internalize any
spillovers of domestic actions––essential to minimize the EU-wide collective costs of LCFI
failures (and therefore moral hazard)––and for advancing key reforms across a broad range
of issues (e.g., more information sharing). Others consider talk about ex-ante mechanisms to
share costs of LCFI failures as premature and entailing moral hazard and risks of forestalling
practical steps towards financial integration. In their view, a host of other issues need to be
settled first. Nonetheless, some proposals to instill more joint accountability and
responsibility of national prudential authorities have been tabled, notably: (i) introducing
EU-related references in the mission statements of national supervisors and qualified
majority voting (in lieu of unanimity) in Lamfalussy Level 3 committees; and (ii) elaborating
LCFI-specific MoUs covering crisis prevention, management, and resolution, including
agreement on EU principles and procedures that these MoUs should incorporate.
28.
Staff pressed for imparting to the system a greater sense of joint responsibility
and accountability, considering it essential to meaningful progress in the prevention
and the efficient and effective handling of LCFI solvency crises. In this regard, staff
views the issue not as one of centralized versus decentralized supervision but about finding
the right balance between the national and system-wide priorities. One possibility would be
to couple proposals to introduce a European orientation into the mandates of prudential
authorities and qualified majority voting at Level 3 committees with a parallel mandate for
these and other authorities to elaborate principles and procedures seeking efficient and
effective LCFI oversight as well as crisis prevention, management, and resolution. These
principles and procedures would have to aim at minimizing collective costs of potential LCFI
failures facing EU states. While such an approach might eventually have to address the
allocation of costs across states, agreement at this juncture on a mandate to minimize

Specifically, no entity in Europe (including the ECB) has a deep knowledge over what is going on in all of the
key LCFI at any point in time.

21
collective costs could be expected to accelerate work toward a balanced strengthening of
Europe’s financial stability framework, notably through establishing a database for sharing
supervisory information on LCFI, including with the ECB; reducing differences in
supervisory powers; enhancing pre-crisis sanctions and tools; harmonizing and improving the
operations of deposit insurance; and understanding and improving the operation of bank
insolvency laws in an area-wide context.11

stretching significantly beyond current
market expectations on official plans for euro adoption, staff asked how the euro-adoption
process––notably the emphasis on sustainability with respect to inflation convergence—
would be managed. Clarification is particularly important in view of the fact that financial
positions and transactions in NMS suggest that economic agents have expectations of euro
adoption within the next 5–7 years.

11

With many of these steps requiring extensive harmonization across national legislation, an alternative
approach would be to put in place a specific EU-level prudential regime (which could, for example, be
elaborated within the Lamfalussy process). See “The Case for a European Banking Charter,” forthcoming IMF
Working Paper.

Interlocutors responded that while the Treaty did embody an expectation to
join, the timing was open and the euro-adoption process was well understood.
Expectations of early entry had over time been replaced by much more cautious statements
by all involved, especially over the past year, without causing market tensions. Furthermore,
EC officials stressed that the “real income convergence” argument was overstated. They
clarified that “sustainability” in the context of the price stability criterion meant that inflation
had to be within Maastricht bounds without reliance on one-off factors, with the assessment
involving backward-looking analysis as well as a forward-looking assessment with a prudent
use of forecasts. Specifically, the examination uses Commission forecasts to assess mediumterm prospects for inflation and includes a statement on whether the candidate country is
likely to meet the reference value in the months after the examination. In the meantime, all
interlocutors considered it key that the NMS seeking euro adoption strengthen their policies
further to ensure a successful operation in the monetary union. In this regard, EC and ECB
officials underscored the useful disciplining effect of the Maastricht criteria. They also
emphasized that the process was an open one, and countries meeting the criteria welcome, as
was clear from the recent admission of Cyprus and Malta.
Europe’s part in addressing global imbalances
31.
Staff welcomed the broad-based structural reform efforts underway, as these
would help strengthen prospects for an orderly resolution of global current account
imbalances. Structural reforms are of course necessary primarily for domestic reasons but
they can help the adjustment process essentially by helping sustain world growth in the face
of a U.S. current account adjustment. The authorities’ multilateral consultation commitments
are all in the structural and financial sector area (Table 3) and are a subset of the initiatives
discussed above. They stressed that the implementation of these reforms is continuing.

23
32.
Staff calculations suggest that the euro’s real effective exchange rate remains
broadly in line with medium-term fundamentals. EC and ECB officials presented broadly
similar calculations but suggested that the exchange rate might be somewhat more
appreciated than suggested by the staff, although still broadly in line with medium-term
fundamentals. Over the past 6 months, the euro, which floats freely and independently,
appreciated slightly in real effective terms, reflecting partly stronger portfolio inflows.
According to staff calculations, the euro continues to be close to equilibrium, as are the
area’s balance of payments and net international investment positions (Figure 18, Tables 4–
5). Furthermore, exports are growing at a healthy pace. Staff downplayed concerns about the
latest exchange rate movements for the recovery.
Europe’s role in promoting world trade
33.
With trade having consistently been a boon to Europe’s productivity
performance, an ambitious conclusion to the Doha Round is very much in the EU’s
interest. There are pressures from some political quarters for the Commission to take a tough
stance in the Doha negotiations because of social considerations. However, the evidence for
trade liberalization driving income inequality in Europe is weak (Box 3). Also, in the staff’s
view trade policy is a poor instrument to manage income inequality. The Commission noted
that the successful conclusion of the Doha round remains the foremost EU trade policy
priority, but that it had already shown sufficient flexibility on agriculture in private
discussions in July 2006. They took the view that other key participants need to make
additional concessions, including the United States on agricultural subsidies and Brazil,
India, and other emerging economies on industrial goods and services. Staff emphasized that
a willingness to agree to additional liberalization by the EU, in particular on agriculture
tariffs, is needed for an ambitious outcome to the Round. Additional liberalization in
agriculture would also provide a greater incentive for the EU’s key trade partners to agree to
greater liberalization in areas of particular interest to the EU, including industrial tariffs and
trade in services.
34.
Staff stressed that free trade agreements (FTAs) were no substitutes for
multilateral trade liberalization in the Doha Round and should not be allowed to
distract political energy and attention from the Doha Round negotiations. Earlier this
year, the EU has embarked on a new series of FTA discussions with Asian countries,
including the ASEAN countries, India, and Korea, as part of its Global Europe initiative.
These discussions come on top of a wide array of ongoing FTA discussions, including those
with the Andean countries, Central America, Mercosur, and the 79 African, Caribbean, and
Pacific (ACP) countries (the latter in the context of Economic Partnership Agreement (EPA)
discussions). The Commission stated that the EU’s bilateral agenda is a complement to, and
not a substitute for, multilateral negotiations. Staff agreed that bilateral agreements may
provide benefits to their participants and may be able to secure liberalization in “new” areas
that fall outside the scope of Doha Round negotiations. However, they are inferior to

Box 3. Income Inequality and Globalization
There is growing concern in Europe over the impact of globalization on high and evenly shared living
standards but this is difficult to substantiate in the data. To a large extent, these concerns have surfaced in
response to slowing wage growth and falling labor income share in aggregate national income data. However,
these data may tell little about the underlying distribution of incomes, as measured by Gini coefficients on
household disposable incomes. While Gini data also suggest that inequality has increased in most industrialized
countries, this development was much less pronounced in euro-area countries, unlike what labor income shares
data suggest.

Data on the distribution of wages of prime age males suggest that advanced countries have fared very
differently and that, therefore, broad phenomena such as trade liberalization and technological change may
not be major drivers of inequality. Inequality of pre-redistribution incomes among prime age males has not
changed much in France, Italy, and the Netherlands. In Germany, some limited hollowing out of the distribution it
visible, but only at the low end. Polarization has taken place in the US and UK but not during the past
“globalization decade.” Instead, it took place during the 1980s, when domestic policies on minimum wages and
trade union representation changed appreciably.

multilateral liberalization for both members and non-members; and their pursuit may divert
political energy and negotiating capacity away from securing an ambitious Doha Round
outcome, both in the EU and the FTA partner countries. The Commission responded that the
Asian FTAs will only begin serious negotiations in 2008, after the target for conclusion of
the Doha Round.
35.
Staff argued that the ongoing review of the EU’s trade defense (e.g.,
antidumping) policy should not increase opportunities for protectionist outcomes. The
Commission indicated that it is too early to predict the conclusions of the review, but
emphasized that the initiative makes clear that the EU rejects the temptations of
protectionism. EC officials also noted that the use of these instruments is consistent with the
EU’s WTO obligations. Staff agreed, but took the view that the EU should also take more
account of the benefits consumers have from trade, and exercise restraint in the use of such
trade defense measures.
II. STAFF APPRAISAL
36.
The euro-area economy is doing well on the heels of a supportive external
environment and generally sound policies. Fifty years after the signing of the Treaty of
Rome, the envisioned Single Market still holds the key to growing prosperity. The
achievements are major and justify optimism. So too does the progress that has been made in
preparing for population aging, the key challenge facing welfare systems.
37.
But policymakers now need to make good on their intentions to overcome
tendencies toward good-times complacency. Much of the progress thus far has been
accomplished during bad economic times, with policies during good times often falling short
of requirements, leaving urgent work undone. The intentions have so far been different this
time around. This is welcome but they must be translated into continued action. The euro
area’s economic governance framework (e.g., the Stability Pact and the Lisbon Agenda) can
and should be used to resist good–times complacency.
38.
The euro-area economy has moved from recovery to upswing. A benign external
environment, favorable financing conditions and generally sound policies have set the stage
for a sustained economic expansion, supported by strong domestic investment expenditure
and strengthening consumption demand. The external position remains roughly balanced and
the real effective exchange rate of the euro continues to trade within range of medium-term
equilibrium. Growth is expected to be above potential in 2007 and 2008 and to be
accompanied by healthy employment gains thanks to reforms to labor markets and welfare
systems, and immigration. The risks to this outlook are relatively small and to the upside in
the short run but widen and move to the downside over the medium run, mainly on account
of external risks relating to oil prices, global current account imbalances, potential investor
flight from risk, and US growth.

26
39.
With rising resource utilization, inflationary pressures can be expected to build
gradually, and some further monetary policy tightening may be required. The policy
rate has come within range of neutral and inflation is widely forecast around 2 percent. Wage
demands remain quite moderate, but may firm as unemployment recedes. As the upswing
unfolds, the necessary magnitude of further monetary tightening depends in part on wages
and the extent to which reforms and demographics have improved labor supply as well as on
the pricing behavior of firms and productivity growth. It also hinges on the evolution of risks
to activity further out, including those related to global imbalances and the exchange rate,
which are presently seen on the downside.
40.
The key challenge facing fiscal policy is to ensure that countries that have not yet
reached their MTO adjust by at least ½ percent of GDP per year. Fiscal policy
performances in 2006 were generally strong, and the announced intentions to reach MTOs by
2010 at the latest are to the point. Meeting these objectives is necessary to limit risks of
procyclical policies in future downturns and to prepare for the build-up in population agingrelated public expenditure that is in the offing. The pressures to slow adjustment and to spend
revenue windfalls will increase as the upswing unfolds, however. These pressures must be
resisted and the standards of the preventive arm of the Stability and Growth Pact be met. In
doing so, consolidation measures ought to be cast in a medium-term budgetary framework
aimed at improving incentives to work and invest. In this regard, the trend toward
strengthening fiscal policy rules and governance mechanisms is welcome. This should help
bring forward the credibility gains from adopting complementary fiscal and structural
policies.
41.
On the structural side, the fundamental challenge is to effect a joint acceleration
of productivity and employment. Reforms to and adjustment in labor markets have led to a
significant strengthening of employment performance, consistent with the area commitments
under the Multilateral Consultations. But the area’s productivity performance has been weak,
in particular in the nontradable services sectors, suggesting that the contestability of national
services markets needs to be raised. The Services Directive is a significant step in this
direction and to hasten its effect, its implementation should be monitored in a framework
featuring interim progress reports. Concurrently, labor market reforms need to remain
oriented toward strengthening participation and incentives to work.
42.
The revamped Lisbon Strategy is picking up steam, but still has some way to go
in fostering ownership, harnessing the national and area-wide synergies among
reforms, and becoming more transparent. The National Reform Programs (NRP) are
useful vehicles to foster greater internal coordination of nationally-driven reform programs
as well as coordination of the latter with Community-led initiatives. And the return to issuing
country-specific policy recommendations testifies to the renewal of the Lisbon Agenda,
which is welcome. These recommendations should, however, increasingly consider NRP
transparency and governance issues.

27
43.
The integration of the markets for financial services is one of the most promising
avenues for boosting Europe’s productivity and growth performance, but it needs to be
complemented by steps imparting a stronger area-wide perspective to the financial
stability framework. Retail financial services need to become more contestable and
Europe’s capital markets developed further. This requires a consistent cross-country
implementation of the EU FSAP (notably MiFID) and integration of the financial
infrastructure (payments systems and securities clearing and settlement systems). On the
financial stability framework, progress is being held back by the continuing tension between
the impulse toward integration on the one hand and the preference for a decentralized
approach, in particular for supervision, on the other. Specifically, under the EU’s home-host
supervision model, supervisors are accountable only to their national authorities,
informational asymmetries between home and host supervisors are large, and actions by one
supervisor have potentially large effects on the jurisdiction of another. Especially when
applied to large cross-border financial institutions (LCFI), this setting largely precludes
progress toward efficient and effective crisis management and resolution, thus fostering
moral hazard and unnecessary risks for national taxpayers. It is also hampering progress on
prevention issues, e.g., supervisory convergence and information sharing.
44.
A more integration-compatible decentralized financial stability framework will
need to rest on a foundation that places more emphasis on joint responsibility and
accountability. In this regard, the proposal to introduce a European orientation to the
mandates of national prudential authorities is welcome. For this to be effective, however, the
mandate should include responsibility to minimize the collective costs facing EU states from
potential LCFI failures. With such mandates, existing initiatives would acquire new life and
urgently required new initiatives would become more practicable. In particular, revamped
cross-border arrangements for supervisory cooperation and memoranda of understanding
should become better able to keep pace with market developments and address the
informational and accountability issues, including the need for more (and more standardized)
ex ante cooperation and information sharing than is common. Such arrangements at the level
of individual LCFI would need to be complemented by a system-wide arrangement that
would need to include extensive information sharing with the ECB. A joint accountability
framework could also enable progress on other thorny issues, including deposit insurance,
work on converging supervisory powers, developing and implementing convergent pre-crisis
sanctions and tools, and analyzing and improving the operation of insolvency laws as applied
to banks in an area-wide context.
45.
With trade having consistently been a boon to Europe’s productivity
performance, an ambitious conclusion to the Doha Round is very much in the EU’s
interest. A willingness to agree to additional liberalization, in particular in agriculture, is
needed on the part of the EU for successful agreement, and the window of opportunity to
reach such an agreement may well be closing. Although well-designed free trade agreements
can be complementary, the trade policy focus should remain on multilateralism. The EU

28
should also take more account of the benefits consumers have from trade and exercise
restraint in the use of contingent protection such as antidumping and special textile
safeguards, even if these are compatible with WTO obligations.
46.
The quality, availability, and timeliness of statistics are adequate for effective areawide surveillance although further improvements are necessary, including with respect to
euro area-wide financial soundness indicators.
47.
It is proposed that the next consultation on the euro-area policies in the context of
Article IV obligations of member countries follow the standard 12-month cycle.

Table 3. Euro Area: Policy Progress and Plans Relevant to the IMFC Strategy1
Over the past year, policies related to the IMFC strategy included structural reforms in three
main areas:
•

Strengthening competition in product markets. Liberalization of network industries; more
effective competition policy; enhanced efficiency of public interventions; adoption of the revised
Services Directive.

•

Implementing new measures in the labor market. A series of measures, implementation of
which is ongoing, have increased labor force participation to 64.5 percent in 2006
(6.6 percentage points since 1995). Many euro-area countries have reformed their public
pension systems since 2001 and have tightened early-retirement schemes.

•

Integrating financial markets across the EU. Multiple initiatives are underway, notably in
context of the Financial Services Action Plan (FSAP) and Lamfalussy framework.2

Looking forward, the euro area authorities’ policy plans include the following:
•

Further reform in product markets. Priorities include further reducing market regulation and
improving the business environment; transposition of the Services Directive in all Member
States by December 2009 at the latest; developing an internal market for network industries
like gas and electricity and removing barriers in regulated trades and professions.

•

Further reform in labor markets. Priorities under the Lisbon-led National Action Plans
include further reform to foster labor utilization and productivity by increasing fiscal incentives
to work and further adjusting benefit systems; fostering flexibility and security in the labor
market, including by modernizing employment protection legislation; better aligning wage and
productivity developments; and enacting measures to promote labor mobility across borders
and between occupations.3

•

Further reform in financial markets. Implementation of the Markets in Financial Instruments
Directive (MiFID)—expected to come into effect on November 1, 2007; integration of market
for clearing and settlement services (TARGET2-Securities, Code of Conduct) and payments
systems (SEPA); implementation of the Solvency II Directive for insurance companies; and
work to create a more integrated retail and wholesale financial markets.4

APPENDIX—STATISTICAL ISSUES
EURO AREA POLICIES
Statistics for the euro area (and the EU-27) are produced by Eurostat and the ECB, generally
on the basis of data reported by member states. These statistics are of sufficient quality,
scope, and timeliness to allow effective macroeconomic surveillance. Nonetheless, gaps and
weaknesses remain, and many of these are difficult to resolve given institutional and other
complexities, including the changing composition of the euro area and EU. In spite of these
complexities, important progress has been made over the past year, including in particular
with the publication of quarterly euro area (i.e., “national”) accounts per institutional sector.
The accessibility of euro area data has also improved thanks to the launch of the ECB’s
Statistical Data Warehouse.13 Eurostat monitoring of member states’ fiscal accounts is
improving. Internationally comparable and higher-frequency financial soundness indicators,
more housing market indicators, and improved statistics on non-bank financial intermediaries
would be desirable. The IMF’s Dissemination Standards Bulletin Board (DSBB)14 provides
comprehensive information on the Euro area's statistical practices for the Special Data
Dissemination Standard (SDDS) data categories.
•

Following up on last year’s release of annual euro area accounts per institutional
sector, Eurostat and the ECB published an initial set of quarterly euro area and EU-27
accounts per institutional sector in June 2007, covering 1999:Q1 until 2006:Q4. New
releases will henceforth follow on a quarterly basis, with a delay that is to be
gradually reduced to 95 days. The new quarterly data will also allow better timeliness
of annual data. Work on non-financial balance sheets per sector continues.

•

A revised Nomenclature générale des Activités Economiques dans les Communautés
Européennes (NACE) classification, NACE Rev. 2, will be introduced gradually from
2008 onwards, applying to 2008 data and beyond. Its introduction will affect a wide
range of statistical series and cause structural breaks due to the limited scope for
back-casting.

•

A European Statistics Code of Practice was adopted in 2005 for Eurostat and the
national statistical agencies, with a coverage that is largely the same as that of the
IMF’s Data Quality Assessment Framework. Self-assessments using the Code of
Practice have taken place, and peer assessments are now ongoing. The Code puts

13

14

Available at: http://dsbb.imf.org/.

53
forward, among other things, a need for professional independence of statistical
authorities.
•

National accounts data covering the pre-1995 period will remain unavailable for the
foreseeable future, although Eurostat is working on the compilation of longer time
series for some key indicators. NACE Rev. 2 is not expected to have major effects on
aggregate economic statistics such as GDP. Efforts are underway to reduce
differences in seasonal and working day adjustment methodologies between member
countries.

•

Structural indicators are being adapted to the requirements of the revamped Lisbonstrategy, with the retention of a set of 14 core indicators and the introduction of four
new ones. In the area of short-term statistics, work is ongoing on better measuring
output volumes of services and output prices. Publication of an euro area import price
index is expected later this year, covering extra-area imports in goods. The Labor
Force Survey is being expanded with more detailed information about the distribution
of wages and a legal act providing for the compilation of data on job vacancies is
being prepared. At present, data from member states are incomplete and not fully
harmonized.

•

A new emphasis on communications with respect to price statistics is being put in
place by Eurostat, other European institutions, and the member states, and a new
standard for quality adjustments of price statistics is being prepared. This new
standard is expected to lead to more reliable quality adjustments and, together with
the work of a center of excellence, greater convergence in adjustment methodologies
between member states. A harmonized index of consumer prices at constant tax rates
(HICP-CT) series should become available from 2008 onward for most EU member
states. Some member states have not yet agreed to regular production of this index,
and this may delay the compilation of euro area aggregates. Preliminary work is
ongoing to better monitor administered prices, and work on housing prices is
continuing, with the aim or producing an experimental euro area index by the end of
2007. A manual on house price statistics is being prepared.

•

Analysis of asymmetries between balance of payments data reported by different
member states continues to improve, both at the aggregate level by Eurostat and the
ECB and between member states. While containing the problem, in particular at the
aggregate level, the asymmetries cannot be expected to be eliminated altogether.
Further progress will require increased harmonization of data collection and
compilation practices, and changes to national confidentiality arrangements.

•

All euro area countries and the ECB provide monetary statistics to the IMF through a
“gateway” arrangement in which the data are channeled through the ECB. This

54
arrangement guarantees the efficient transmission of monetary statistics to the IMF
and reduces reporting burdens in euro area countries.
•

Also, all EU countries participated in the IMF’s Coordinated Compilation Exercise
for Financial Soundness Indicators (FSIs). Data and metadata on a benchmark set of
indicators of financial system soundness for end-2005 for all EU countries, but no
aggregated data for the euro area and EU, have been posted on the IMF website. The
aggregated FSIs for the euro area that were until 2005 published annually in the
ECB’s Banking Sector Stability Report, which were prepared using a different
methodology, have been provisionally discontinued due to the staggered
implementation of International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS). The latest
issue of the report includes only separate aggregations for IFRS and non-IFRS
reporting EU member states. Euro area and EU aggregates will be reimplemented for
end-2007 data when IFRS-compliant data will be required in all countries for
supervisory reporting. The ECB’s Financial Stability Review, which is published on a
semi-annual frequency , includes a set of indicators covering only large, complex
financial institutions given its focus on systemic developments. Overall, no
comprehensive set of euro-area wide financial soundness indicators is available at
present, and information on non-bank financial institutions is particularly scarce, in
part due to limited information exchange between the relevant authorities.

•

The recent entry of Slovenia in the euro area went smoothly from a statistical point of
view. Going forward, European statistical authorities intend to focus efforts on
maintaining data for only a selection of historical compositions of the euro area and
EU.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND
EURO AREA POLICIES
Staff Report for the 2007 Article IV Consultation with Member Countries
Supplementary Information
Prepared by the European Department
Approved by Michael Deppler and Adnan Mazarei
July 20, 2007
1.
This supplement provides an update of economic and policy developments since
the release of the staff report (7/10/07). The thrust of the staff appraisal remains
unchanged.
2.
Recent data indicate that economic activity remains buoyant (Table 1). Growth in
2007:Q1 was revised up modestly, to 2.8 percent on a quarterly annualized basis (3.1 percent
over 2006:Q1). Industrial production data for May and purchasing managers’ indices for
manufacturing and services in June point to robust growth ahead.
3.
Exports continue to show strong momentum. The latest foreign trade data suggest
that euro-area (nominal) goods exports stood 9 percent and imports 5 percent above lastyear’s levels during January-May 2007. Over the same period, the trade balance swung from
a deficit of euro 20 billion (0.2 percent of GDP) to a surplus of euro 4 billion. The staff’s
March 2007 assessment suggested that the euro’s real effective exchange rate was still
broadly in line with fundamentals; since then the currency has appreciated by about 2 percent
in real effective terms.
4.
Headline and core inflation stayed at 1.9 percent in June. Capacity utilization
continues to increase. Unemployment fell to 7.0 percent in May, the lowest level since the
beginning of harmonized records. Labor cost indicators, however, suggest still contained
wage increases. Inflation expectations have essentially moved sideways.
5.
The ECB left interest rates unchanged at its July 5 meeting. Market participants
expect further interest rate hikes in September and December, to 4½ percent by end year.
6.
Pressures to slow fiscal adjustment are mounting. Since the staff report was
finalized, key countries have loosened fiscal targets or tabled proposals to do so.

IMF Executive Board Discusses Euro Area Policies
On July 25, 2007, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded the
discussion of euro area policies.1
Background
The euro area economy is doing well on the heels of a supportive external environment and
generally sound policies. Real GDP growth has been running around 2½ percent; fiscal deficits
are markedly lower than a few years ago; and strong export growth, improving profitability and
balance sheets, and accommodative financial conditions have fostered a broad-based
upswing of investment and employment.
Capacity utilization indicators are moving up, with some already close to previous cyclical
peaks. Thus far labor does not appear to be a major constraining factor. Amid supply sidedriven moderation, the cyclical response of wages appears to have diminished. Backward
looking indicators show subdued wages through 2006 and wage settlements continue to
surprise on the downside. While unemployment rates have fallen below the 2000 trough,
equilibrium rates appear to have fallen further and labor force participation and population are
on the rise. Key developments include the deregulation-enabled shift of employment toward
part-time and temporary jobs; the rising labor force participation of women and older workers;
high immigration; and more efficient welfare programs.

1

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On
return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the
Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the
Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the
country's authorities.

2
Since September 2006, headline inflation measured by the Harmonised Index of Consumer
Prices (HICP) has been running in line with the European Central Bank’s “close to but under” 2
percent target. Financial market-based measures, analysts expectations, and various
indicators of inflation suggest that, adjusted for oil and administrative price as well as tax hikes,
inflationary pressure has been mounting only gradually.
Fiscal policy performance was generally strong in 2006. Standard measures suggest that the
area’s cyclically-adjusted fiscal deficit fell by somewhat under 1 percentage point of GDP in
2006—exceeding staff’s ½ percent of GDP benchmark for countries at a significant distance
from close to balance or surplus. In general, higher-than-budgeted revenues have been
allocated to debt reduction, even if not to the full extent by all countries.
In line with strengthening activity, the European Central Bank has raised the main policy rate
eight times since December 2005 to 4 percent. Nonetheless, financial conditions are still on
the accommodative side. The financial system is viewed as relatively healthy and financial
market volatility as well as risk premia remain historically low, although there are some signs
that the credit cycle is gradually turning.
The euro area’s external setting is propitious. The area’s external current account is broadly
balanced and export growth has been dynamic. The euro’s real effective exchange rate has
appreciated by about 1 percent since the end of 2006 and is broadly unchanged from two and
a half years ago.
Against this background, the staff projects above potential real GDP growth of around
2½ percent through 2008. The risks to growth are generally small and to the upside in the
short run but widening and moving to the downside over the medium run, mainly on account of
external risks relating to oil prices, global current account imbalances, potential investor flight
from risk, and US growth.
Executive Board Assessment
Directors welcomed the euro area economy’s move from recovery to upswing. Against the
backdrop of a broadly equilibrated external position and exchange rate, they expected real
GDP growth to remain above potential over the near term and employment gains to stay
healthy thanks in part to reforms to labor markets and welfare systems.
Directors observed that with rising resource utilization inflationary pressures could be expected
to build gradually and some further monetary policy tightening might be required. The
necessary magnitude of further tightening would have to depend on wages and the pricing
behavior of firms and also on the extent to which reforms and demographics have improved
labor supply and productivity growth. In addition, further tightening would hinge on the
evolution of external risks to activity further out, including those related to global imbalances
and the exchange rate, which are presently seen on the downside.
Directors considered that the external position of the euro area remains roughly in balance and
that the real effective exchange rate of the euro continues to trade within range of the mediumterm equilibrium. They welcomed the broad-based structural reform efforts underway and

3
underscored that their continued implementation, in line with the authorities’ multilateral
consultation commitments, will help strengthen prospects for an orderly resolution of global
current account imbalances.
Directors welcomed the generally strong fiscal policy performances of 2006 and the
announced intentions to reach medium-term fiscal objectives by 2010 at the latest. With a view
to preparing for accelerated population aging soon after 2010, Directors encouraged the
authorities of countries that have not yet reached these objectives to continue to lower their
cyclically-adjusted fiscal deficits by at least ½ percent of GDP per year, consistent with the
rules of the Stability and Growth Pact. Given the good economic times, they considered it
particularly important not to repeat past mistakes and loosen fiscal targets in response to
abundant revenues. In this regard, they supported the trend toward strengthening national
fiscal policy rules and governance mechanisms.
Looking forward, Directors observed that, while immediate prospects were strong, population
aging was likely to prompt a significant slowing of potential growth. In this setting, they
considered achieving a joint structural acceleration of productivity and labor force participation
rates to be the fundamental challenge. They agreed that the Lisbon Strategy was beginning to
play an important role and that the transparency and governance of National Reform Programs
could usefully be strengthened further to that effect. Past labor market reforms had clearly paid
off, leading to a significant strengthening of employment growth, consistent with the area
commitments under the Multilateral Consultation. Achieving the same for productivity growth
would require raising the contestability of national services markets. Hastening the
implementation of the Services Directive would be a significant step in this direction.
Directors also viewed the integration of the markets for financial services as one of the most
promising avenues for boosting Europe’s productivity and growth performance. They
advocated raising the contestability of national retail markets and deepening Europe’s capital
markets. Accordingly, they emphasized the need for a prompt implementation of the Markets
in Financial Instruments Directive and welcomed steps to integrate national payments and
securities clearing and settlement systems as well as ongoing work to facilitate crossborder
bank mergers and acquisitions.
Directors agreed that a further strengthening of Europe’s crossborder financial stability
framework could help promote progress towards efficient and effective financial crisis
prevention, reduce moral hazard, and avoid unnecessary risks for national taxpayers.
Directors also agreed that establishing the foundation for a decentralized but more integrationcompatible financial stability framework required measures targeted at fostering cooperation,
in particular in the area of supervision. Most Directors thought that this entailed an increased
emphasis on joint responsibility and accountability, including mandates that call for minimizing
the collective costs facing EU states from potential large cross-border financial institutions
failures.
With trade having consistently been a boon to Europe’s productivity performance, Directors
emphasized the need for an ambitious conclusion to the Doha Round to boost the area’s

4
already high living standards. They therefore encouraged the authorities to resist protectionist
pressures and agree to additional trade liberalization, in particular in agriculture.
It is expected that the next consultation on the euro area policies in the context of Article IV
obligations of member countries will be held on the standard 12-month cycle.

Statement by Klaus Stein, Executive Director for Euro Area
July 25, 2007

In my capacity as President of EURIMF, I am pleased to submit this Buff statement on the
Article IV consultation with the euro area. My statement reflects the common view of the
euro area Member States and the European Community in their respective fields of
competence.
The authorities of the euro area Member States welcome the IMF staff's assessment of
economic developments and prospects in the euro area. While broadly concurring with the
findings of the Fund, on some issues views differ, as I will outline in my statement. I will
also update the Board on recent economic developments.
Short-term economic outlook
The euro area economy is in the second year of a robust economic recovery, growing at solid
rates. The upturn is driven by strong growth of exports which benefit from continued
favorable global demand conditions. On the domestic side, investment activity has been
firming over several years and should give, despite a softening of construction investment in
the course of the year, a substantial contribution to output growth also in 2007. Private
consumption has shown some strengthening as well but remains weaker than in previous
upswings. However, with unemployment having fallen to a level not seen in 25 years, rising
consumer confidence should eventually feed into the spending behavior of households.
Short-term indicators point favorably to output growth at or above potential in the second and
third quarter of this year. While hard data are somewhat mixed, especially those related to
private consumption, survey indicators suggest that confidence remains high among both
consumers and enterprises. For the year as a whole, output growth should therefore stay
above 2½ percent. Looking ahead, the euro area economy is expected to grow further at a
sustained rate also in 2008, as a moderation in capital spending should be largely
compensated by stronger consumption growth. Although it is too early to have a definite
view, the improved outlook is mostly due to a cyclical upturn. At the same time, there are
signs that some structural factors may also be at work as well.

2
The euro area authorities largely share the staff's view on real GDP growth in 2007 and 2008.
We note that the discrepancy which existed a year ago regarding the projections for private
consumption has largely disappeared. The authorities also broadly concur with the risk
scenario put forward by the staff. In particular, over the medium term the risks are slightly
tilted to the downside and related to the possibility of a sharper than expected slowdown in
the United States, potential protectionist pressures, financial market risks, further unexpected
oil price increases and the potential of a disorderly unwinding of global imbalances. In the
short term, however, the risks to the outlook are broadly balanced.
Monetary policy and the outlook for price stability
The ECB broadly agrees with the Fund staff’s assessment that some further monetary policy
action is likely to be necessary to stabilize inflation rates below 2 percent, in line with its
definition of price stability. After the increase in key interest rates in June the ECB’s
monetary policy is still on the accommodative side, given the continued positive economic
environment in the euro area. The Governing Council of the ECB will continue to act in a
firm and timely manner to ensure price stability over the medium term.
Turning to the outlook for price developments, annual HICP inflation was 1.9 percent in the
first half of 2007. However, in assessing future inflation trends it is important to look beyond
any short-term volatility in inflation rates, in particular as last year’s volatility in energy
prices is giving rise to significant base effects, which have and will strongly influence the
short-term profile of annual inflation rates.
At the policy relevant medium-term horizon, the Governing Council of the ECB holds the
view that the risks to price stability remain on the upside. In the Governing Council’s view,
with a high degree of resource utilization and continuously improving labor markets in the
euro area economy, capacity constraints are emerging which could lead in particular to
stronger than expected wage dynamics and profit margin developments. Such developments
would pose significant risks to price stability. In addition, upside risks to price stability arise
from increases in administered prices and indirect taxes beyond those anticipated so far, and
the potentially pro-cyclical fiscal policy stance in some euro area countries. Further risks may
arise from further unexpected oil price increases.
Cross-checking the outcome of the ECB’s economic analysis with that of its monetary
analysis confirms the existence of upside risks to price stability at medium to longer
horizons. The underlying rate of monetary expansion remains strong, as reflected in
continued rapid growth of the broad monetary aggregate M3 and the still high level of credit
growth. Following several years of robust monetary growth and the continued vigor of
money and credit expansion, liquidity in the euro area remains ample. In this environment,
upside risks to price stability prevail at medium to longer-term horizons. Therefore, monetary
developments continue to require very careful monitoring, particularly against the
background of the current economic expansion and still strong property market
developments.

3
In this light, the Governing Council will continue to monitor closely all developments in
order to ensure that risks to price stability over the medium term do not materialize and that
inflation expectations in the euro area remain solidly anchored at levels consistent with price
stability. Solid anchoring of inflation expectations is a prerequisite for monetary policy to
make an ongoing contribution towards supporting sustainable economic growth and job
creation in the euro area.
Fiscal developments and fiscal policy
The euro area authorities share the staff's assessment of the improved budgetary situation,
including some uncertainty related to the sustainability of the recent tax revenue
performance.
In 2006, the general government deficit in the euro area fell for the third consecutive year,
while the debt ratio recorded its first decline since 2002. Taken at face value, the
improvement seems to be structural. However, as rightly pointed out by the staff, since the
buoyancy of tax revenues may reflect both permanent and temporary factors, the jury is still
out on the actual determinants of the estimated improvement in the structural budget balance
in 2006.
The authorities welcome the staff's overall positive assessment regarding the functioning of
the reformed Stability and Growth Pact (SGP). In this context, it is important to emphasize
that countries with excessive deficits have made significant structural efforts to correct their
deficits within the deadlines established under the reformed SGP. At the same time, the
authorities agree that the agreed rules of the preventive arm of the Pact should be fully
implemented, and that further progress is needed to reach sound budgetary balances in the
medium term.
The staff's focus on the necessity to reach the Medium Term Objectives (MTOs) fits well to
the orientations for fiscal policies in euro area Member States adopted by the Eurogroup on
April 20, 2007. The Eurogroup emphasized the need to make the preventive arm of the Pact
work in the current good economic times by stepping up consolidation towards the MTOs
and avoiding pro-cyclical loosening. This would create the necessary scope for the full
working of the automatic stabilizers in less favorable economic times. It would also allow
reducing debt levels and contribute to the sustainability of public finances.
The euro area authorities find interesting the staff's suggestions for strengthening the national
fiscal policy rules and national governance mechanisms to improve the implementation of the
preventive arm of the Pact and help to strengthen budgetary positions. The Commission has
recently put forward a number of proposals aimed at improving the effectiveness of the
preventive arm of the Pact. These proposals are being currently examined by the euro area
authorities. In this context, it is worth noting that Member States already developed strategies
to improve spending efficiency such as more use of performance information and of medium
term budgetary frameworks.

4
Structural policies
The euro area authorities share the staff's assessment of progress made in the area of
structural reform. We are now close to the end of the first three-year cycle in the revised
Lisbon strategy. In the coming months, policy directions for the next cycle covering the
period 2008 to 2010 will be established.
As regards the functioning of the revised Lisbon strategy, experience suggests that the new
governance based on a partnership between Member States and the EU is creating a greater
sense of "national ownership" of objectives and commitments. The suggestions of the staff
for greater transparency in reform commitments and for harnessing the synergies in reform
efforts are timely and well considered. Considerable efforts are now being devoted to
improve methods for evaluating National Reform Programs, the Lisbon Community
Program, and their externalities. Moreover, a major element in ongoing reflections is how to
achieve a better interaction between reform initiatives at national and EU level.
The most recent assessments of progress with structural reforms carried out by the
Commission and the Council provide signs that many reforms are underway. Good progress
has been made towards boosting R&D and innovation, improving regulation and enhancing
the business environment, especially for small and medium-sized enterprises. Also, the shift
to a knowledge-based economy appears to be well underway. If announced plans entailed in
the National Reform Programs are implemented as intended, R&D spending will rise to 2.8%
of GDP by 2010, up from 1.9% of GDP in 2005.
Also, important steps have been taken to reinforce the sustainability and the quality of public
finances. Governments have been generally setting out appropriate measures to improve their
budgetary positions and deal with projected increases in pension and health-care costs.
Nevertheless, achieving sound finances in the medium to long term as well as raising the
efficiency and effectiveness of public spending remain significant challenges.
Some reforms have started to deliver benefits, though many reforms are yet at an early stage
and will need to be fully followed through to make a lasting economic impact. In this
context, the authorities agree with the staff that market contestability in sheltered sectors,
especially in services, needs to be improved. A successful and timely implementation of the
Services Directive is essential for improving the regulatory environment in services. On the
staff's suggestion that the coverage of the Directive be extended to cover professional
services, the authorities clarify that although a series of services are excluded from the
application of the Directive, it does apply to most professional services.
Analysis suggests that past structural reforms enacted by euro area Member States might
have added a structural component to the recent cyclical upswing. There is evidence of
structural improvement on the labor markets: structural rates of unemployment have declined
since 2000, and there have been large and sustained increases in the employment rates of
women and older workers. Labor productivity in the euro area is also experiencing a strong

5
recovery. Nevertheless, the nature of this productivity pick-up is not fully certain. Although
there are signs that it is not entirely cyclical, it is too early to draw confident conclusions.
Financial sector issues
The euro area authorities share the staff's view on the importance of the financial sector
integration process for the region's growth performance. In order to better understand the
productivity gap in financial services (ex insurance), it would be helpful to have more details
on the staff's research, including the impact of potential measurement discrepancies.
Financial integration has been an EU policy priority since 1998 and now forms an integral
part of the Lisbon strategy as a means to deliver a more productive use of capital and higher
output potential.
Stimulated by regulatory reform and the euro introduction, the process of EU financial
integration is well underway, in particular in wholesale markets. Measures of the Financial
Services Action Plan (FSAP) are almost fully transposed by Member States, but the staff
rightly emphasizes the crucial role of supervisors and the Commission in ensuring their
consistent implementation. In this context, the functioning of the Lamfalussy process is
currently under review, and possible improvements may be discussed later this year. Further,
in accordance with the principle of Better Regulation, the Commission has launched an
external study on the evaluation of the FSAP policies. Regarding ongoing work, the major
initiatives highlighted by the staff reflect the priorities set in the White Paper on Financial
Services Policy for the period 2005-2010, while the Green Paper on Retail Financial Services
published early this year has confirmed the Commission's commitment to targeted measures
in the retail area.
With regards to macro-stability risks, euro area authorities remain optimistic on the financial
sector's capacity to absorb adverse shocks, while acknowledging risks associated with a
turning of the credit cycle. The authorities also agree with the staff's recommendations that
ensuring the adequacy of supervisory structures is crucial as financial integration progresses.
Building on previous analysis and the outcome of crisis simulation exercises, a report on
developing EU financial stability arrangements is just being finalized by an Ad Hoc Working
Group established after the informal Ecofin meeting in Helsinki in September 2006. The
main challenges in this respect are to develop cooperation and tools for prevention,
management and resolution aimed at the minimization of overall costs in the event of a
potentially systemic cross-border crisis and providing appropriate incentive structures for all
involved parties.
There is also ongoing work within the FSC on the challenges for the current supervisory
framework. In this context, the euro area authorities welcome the staff's analysis and
suggestions as an input to the ongoing debate, but warn against a too alarmist tone which in
our view fails to acknowledge the developments of the past years, both at the legislative level
and in regard to the enhancement of cooperation and coordination arrangements of the crisis

6
management.
Euro area integration
The euro area authorities emphasize the open character of the euro area enlargement process
within a rules-based framework, as reflected in the recent decision on euro adoption by
Cyprus and Malta on January 1, 2008. While authorities subscribe to the position that real
income catching-up is not a separate convergence criterion, they stress the importance of
achieving nominal convergence in a sustainable manner, with the assessment involving both
backward- and forward-looking elements. It implies that countries should not rely on one-off
measures or a temporary downward shock to meet the criterion only during a short time
frame. As reported by the staff, euro area authorities underscore the key role of strong
policies in preparation for euro adoption. In particular, fiscal and structural policies should be
orientated towards ensuring a successful long-term performance under monetary union.
International economic relations
As noted by the staff, the euro area's contribution to the resolution of global imbalances – as
agreed in the context of the multilateral consultations – is part of the more broadly based
Lisbon Strategy for Growth and Jobs. Also for domestic reasons, the euro area authorities are
therefore firmly committed to its implementation.
It is important, however, that other participants of the multilateral consultations also deliver
on their commitments and that countries that did not directly participate in the consultations
contribute to the adjustment effort needed for an orderly correction of global imbalances. The
Fund can continue to play a very useful role in the process through its monitoring, both in the
context of the Article IV consultations and in the context of its regional and multilateral
surveillance.
Regarding trade policy, the euro area authorities share the importance attached by the staff to
an ambitious conclusion of the Doha Round. Throughout 2006 and 2007, the EU continued
to play a key role in the efforts to push forward the negotiations. In particular, the EU was
instrumental in the re-launch of the negotiations in early 2007 – after a 6 months suspension
of the talks. Despite the difficulties encountered during negotiations, it remains the EU's firm
intention to ensure its successful conclusion.
The EU has lately launched a new generation of carefully chosen bilateral free trade
agreements with Asean countries, South Korea and India, which should help tackle some
non-tariff barriers and step up the EU’s engagement with rapidly growing Asian economies.
The authorities concur with the staff's view that the free trade agreements should not be
substitutes for an ambitious liberalization under the Doha Development Agenda. Indeed, they
are not. They are designed to be complementary to the multilateral trade liberalization. The
EU’s priority is to ensure that any new free trade agreement is a stepping stone for, rather
than a stumbling block to, progressive liberalization within the WTO system.
