Discussions for the 2007 Article IV consultation, first review of the PRGF arrangement, and
preparations for bringing the C.A.R. to the HIPC decision point were held in Bangui August 9–
23, 2007. The mission comprised Mr. York (head), Mr. Kinoshita, Ms. Schumacher, and
Mr. Nachega (August 9–16) (all AFR). The mission was joined by World Bank and African
Development Bank staff and Mr. Mamadou (OED). The mission met with President Bozizé;
Prime Minister Doté; Mr. Ndoutingaï, Minister of Finance and Budget and Mines; Mr. Maliko,
Minister of Planning and Economic Development; other ministers and senior government
officials; Mr. Derant-Lakoue, National Director of the Bank of Central African States; and
representatives of the private sector, labor unions, donors, and the media.

•

The last Article IV consultation was completed on October 24, 2005. In December 2006 the
Executive Board approved a three-year PRGF arrangement for the C.A.R. in an amount
equivalent to SDR 36.2 million (65 percent of quota). The first disbursement was made in midJanuary 2007 in an amount equivalent to SDR 17.6 million, part of which the authorities used
to repay EPCA loans. In mid-March 2007 the Executive Board agreed that the C.A.R. is
eligible for enhanced HIPC Initiative debt relief and that the decision point could be reached at
the time of the first review of the PRGF arrangement if performance has been satisfactory and
discussions on the completion point triggers have been finalized.

•

The C.A.R. has accepted the obligations of Article VIII, sections 2(a), 3 and 4, and maintains
an exchange system free of restrictions. The currency has had a fixed parity with the euro at a
rate of 656 CFA francs since January 1, 1999. The C.A.R. is a member of the Central African
Economic and Monetary Community (CEMAC).

•

During the discussions, the key policy concerns were the challenge of accelerating growth as
the C.A.R.’s main contribution to enhancing the external viability of the CEMAC, establishing
a medium-term fiscal strategy to support implementation of the authorities’ Poverty Reduction
Strategy Paper, and the potential benefits to the C.A.R. of further sub-regional integration.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
Over the past several decades political struggle and armed conflict have adversely affected
domestic stability in the Central African Republic (C.A.R.), slowing growth and causing a
deterioration in living standards. But a recent improvement in the political and social situation and
economic policies has provided a firm basis for economic recovery. The reengagement of the
international financial community has helped, but foreign aid has been unpredictable and insufficient.

Recent developments and prospects
•

At 4.1 percent, real GDP growth in 2006 reached the highest level in a decade and
inflation has moderated more recently. Private consumption and investment picked up, as did
diamond and timber exports. For the first time in years, agriculture made a modest contribution
to growth with the resurgence of cash crops like cotton and coffee.

•

The government’s fiscal objectives for 2006 were achieved and performance was generally
satisfactory in the first half of 2007. Firm control over expenditure, especially wages and
salaries, and strong tax collections stemming from tax and customs administration
improvements and some tax measures, led to a domestic primary surplus of 0.4 percent of GDP
last year, in line with the budget. This surplus has narrowed slightly during the first semester of
2007, partly on account of a government decision to help facilitate the recapitalization of a
troubled commercial bank and delays in aid flows.

•

Progress is being made on structural reform. Public financial management, domestic
revenue mobilization, and governance is being enhanced, and the reform agenda is being
broadened to improving the business environment more generally.

•

The short-term outlook is benign. There is an upside risk if the disbursement of aid inflows is
higher than programmed this year.

Policies to enhance external viability
•

Policies to raise potential growth could enhance external viability. These policies would
help reverse the prolonged decline in the country’s openness to trade, enhance competitiveness,
and diversify the export base. Here, consolidating macroeconomic stability and accelerating
structural reform are important, with the smooth execution of the program highly dependent on
financial and technical assistance from donors.

•

Clearly, a recovery of the private sector will be required to sustain high growth. In this
regard, creating a more favorable environment for investment is critical. Key private sector
reforms include updating forestry and mining legislation, fully implementing OHADA business
laws, and combating corruption.

•

A medium-term fiscal strategy is becoming a high priority. Such a strategy should be rooted
in fiscal sustainability so that it can provide a sound basis for dealing with the anticipated
scaling up of aid flows, and possible future borrowing in the sub-regional or domestic market.

Given the generally satisfactory implementation of the PRGF arrangement through end-June 2007,
the staff supports the completion of the first review and the authorities’ request for waiver of three
quantitative and two structural performance criteria, and modification of the end-December 2007
targets, in light of the corrective actions taken and the authorities’ commitment to achieve the policy
objectives supported by the arrangement.

4
I. BACKGROUND
1.
Over the past several decades political struggle and armed conflict have
adversely affected domestic stability in the C.A.R., slowing growth and causing a
deterioration of living standards. The economy has also been buffeted by exogenous
shocks, such as droughts and regional instability, and a long-term decline in the terms of
trade that brought trade volumes down. The C.A.R. has thus made virtually no progress on
achieving the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), and the UNDP’s human
development index places the C.A.R. near the bottom of all countries (172nd of 177).
2.
The formal sector has been declining for years, making it hard to mobilize
domestic revenue and leading to a significant accumulation of domestic and external
public debt. At about 8 percent of GDP, the C.A.R.’s tax revenue ratio is among the lowest
for developing countries. At the end of 2006, the country’s public and publicly-guaranteed
external debt was estimated at US$ 726 million in NPV terms, equivalent to about
350 percent of exports of goods and services and 518 percent of government revenue;
domestic debt was about 22.6 percent of GDP.
3.
A coup d’état in 2003 marked the end of generalized conflict and the beginning
of economic and institutional recovery. General Bozizé, the leader of the coup, later won
free and fair elections in 2005. Since then, despite pockets of insecurity, the political and
social situation has generally become more stable. This has allowed the government to focus
on economic management—a critical element supporting recovery.
4.
Recent political and economic developments have encouraged the international
financial community to reengage with the C.A.R. The Fund provided Emergency PostConflict Assistance in July 2004 and January 2006 and approved a three-year PRGF
arrangement in December 2006; arrears to the World Bank and the African Development
Bank (AfDB) were cleared late last year. In March 2007, the Fund’s Board also agreed that
the country is eligible for enhanced Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) Initiative debt
relief and that it could reach the decision point when the first review of the PRGF
arrangement is completed. The C.A.R. will qualify for the Multilateral Debt Relief Initiative
(MDRI) once it reaches the HIPC completion point. In April 2007 the Paris Club agreed to
reschedule its debt on Naples terms and to defer debt service during the program period
(2007–09); the terms will improve to Cologne terms at the decision point.1 In June 2007 a

The staff understands that the authorities are making a good faith effort to reach a collaborative agreement
with its other bilateral and commercial creditors; and it is expected that debt to these creditors will be
rescheduled on terms at least as favorable as those granted by the Paris Club.

5.
The authorities have been receptive to the Fund’s policy advice within the
context of both Fund-supported programs and surveillance. In line with this advice, the
authorities have been making a determined effort to consolidate peace and security, establish
the conditions for strong growth, and reverse deteriorating social conditions. Strong program
ownership is also being demonstrated. However, with weak capacity and limited financial
resources, the Board has also noted that the smooth implementation of the authorities’
program is highly dependent on financial and technical assistance from donors.
II. RECENT DEVELOPMENTS AND PROSPECTS
6.
After a slow start, the C.A.R.’s economic recovery is gathering strength. Real
GDP grew by 4.1 percent in 2006, compared with 1.3 percent in 2004 after the conflict
ended. Private consumption and investment picked up, as did diamond and timber exports
(Table 1). For the first time in years, agriculture made a modest contribution to growth with
the resurgence of cash crops like cotton and coffee. Though inflation was relatively high in
2006, it has declined recently—the 12-month rate was 1.6 percent through June 2007—as
food prices moderated.
7.
With strong export growth and higher official transfers related to recent
external arrears clearance, the external current account deficit narrowed significantly,
from about 6.5 percent of GDP in 2005 to 2.7 percent last year (Table 2). Exports of
wood products were particularly buoyant; they now account for nearly half of all exports
(though this highlights the narrowness of the country’s export base.) The growth of goods
imports has not kept pace with that of exports, but the deficit in services trade (travel, freight,
insurance) accounts for more than half of the recent current account deficit. Foreign direct
investment is expanding slowly but is not sufficient to cover the C.A.R.’s balance of
payments needs. Repayment
of public debt continues to
be a significant source of
outflows; amortization of
medium-term loans amounts
to about 15 percent of goods
exports. The real effective
exchange rate (REER)
appreciated by less than
3 percent in the 12 months
through May 2007 because
inflation was higher in the
C.A.R. than in its trading
partners (Figure 2).

The government’s fiscal objectives for 2006 were achieved and performance was
generally satisfactory in the first half of 2007 (Tables 3 and 4). In 2006 current
expenditures were slightly above budget due to exogenous factors (mainly high world oil
prices and unanticipated military spending to address problems in the north), but they were
offset by increased revenues resulting from government efforts to enhance tax and customs
administration and by changes in some tax measures. The result was a domestic primary
fiscal surplus of about 0.4 percent of GDP, in line with the budget, which allowed the
government to clear 1.2 percent of GDP

The government completed the

(equivalent to about 11½ percent of GDP). A strategy for clearing these arrears is now

Excludes interest payments, foreign-financed investment, and grants.

2

Disbursements of program grants during the first semester amounted to CFAF 8 billion, of which
CFAF 2.5 billion was tied to debt cancellation, leaving a shortfall of programmed budget support.

3

The authorities attributed the weakness in customs and VAT collections to several factors: the recent
harmonization of the VAT on basic consumption goods across the CEMAC region, which reduced the rate from
19 percent to 0 and had a higher-than-anticipated effect; a transport strike and plane crash that disrupted trade
through the important Douala-Bangui corridor; and a shorter number of trading days in the month of May.

8
being discussed with stakeholders and the government is seeking foreign assistance to
support this effort. For wage and pension arrears, the intention is to repay them over a tenyear period and consideration is being given to land swaps for arrears to civil servants; while
for commercial creditors, the intention is to discount the amounts due in return for a shorter
repayment period.
10.
Performance of the banking system has been mixed. While the problem
commercial bank has been recapitalized and now complies with all prudential requirements,
the largest microfinance institution does not meet minimum capital requirements. As of June
2006, its minimum capital shortfall was about CFAF 66 million. This is being addressed by
closing provincial branches to boost net income.
11.
The authorities are making progress on structural reform, although efforts to
enhance tax and customs administration have not moved ahead as smoothly as
envisaged. Over the past year or so, to improve public expenditure management, the
government has undertaken to eliminate fraud and duplication in the public sector payroll,
establish a unified database for civil servants and military personnel, close a large number of
Treasury commercial bank accounts, restrict issuance of Treasury checks, reduce the
indiscriminate use of cash advances, and issue a decree on public accounting regulation. Tax
administration reforms have been designed to enhance taxpayer compliance, strengthen the
large taxpayer unit, and regularly audit domestic revenue sources, but more of the informal
economy and unregistered enterprises need to be captured and exemptions eliminated.
Reform of the customs administration included restructuring of all activities under a single
entity, but problems with inadequate capacity still undermine performance. Other structural
moves have been directed at enhancing governance and improving the business climate,
improving the regulatory framework in the forestry and mining sector, addressing financial
and commercial crime, and implementing the legal framework supported by OHADA.4
A. Program Performance
12.
Through June 2007 policy implementation was broadly satisfactory. The few
slippages that did occur were mainly related to donor coordination problems and the
government’s decision—consistent with its obligations under the commercial law—to
facilitate recapitalization of a systemically important commercial bank by a foreign investor.
Three of the seven end-June quantitative performance criteria were not observed, for which
the authorities are requesting waivers (Table 5):
•

The government facilitated recapitalization of the troubled commercial bank by
paying government-guaranteed liabilities of wholly state-owned enterprises to that

for common business law in 16 African countries with a French legal tradition.

9
bank, equivalent to CFAF 2.7 billion (about 0.3 percent of GDP). Because this
transaction is recorded as a transfer, it lowered the domestic primary surplus to about
0.1 percent of GDP less than envisaged. The government reversed some of the impact
of this transaction by cutting back capital expenditure, as the highly compressed
budget provides for only minimal public services.
•

This transaction and a delay in donor budget support did not allow for the planned net
repayment by the government to the commercial banking system. Instead of repaying
CFAF 2 billion (about 0.2 percent of GDP) at the end of June, the government
borrowed CFAF 0.6 billion net.

•

Wages and salaries were slightly above the program’s performance criterion
(CFAF 17.7 billion, compared with CFAF 17.5 billion targeted) because of unplanned
compensation payments to retirees. Further retirements will require additional
payments this year; the government will offset these outlays with savings on payroll
to maintain the wage ceiling. The savings will come about through reclassifying jobs
to resolve improper grading, reducing salaries where credentials cannot be justified,
and eliminating unjustified benefits.

13.
To fully accommodate the fiscal impact of the government’s decision to speed
recapitalization of the commercial bank and account for additional domestic interest
payments (equivalent to about 0.4 percent of GDP), the authorities are requesting
modification of the related end-December performance criteria.5 These include (i) the
floor on the domestic primary balance and (ii) the change in net claims of the commercial
banking system on the government (see the Table attached to the Supplemental Letter of
Intent). The authorities believe that the revised targets are consistent with their PRGFsupported policy objectives for this year, especially consolidation to allow some repayment
of domestic debt, while giving them some fiscal room to maneuver. A further increase in
nontax revenue from telecommunication fees is expected to provide enough resources to
deliver the higher domestic primary surplus that is needed to cover the additional debt service
this year.
14.
All of the structural conditions through end-June 2007 were observed, two with
a delay for which the authorities are requesting waivers (Table 6).6 The external audit of
the one-stop customs window was slowed by donor coordination problems, but the
government financed it by itself to avoid further slippage. The external audit of domestic
5

The additional debt service is due to an earlier debt rescheduling with the central bank that was not accounted
for in the budget for this year, and interest payments on new liabilities to commercial banks.

The program includes a structural benchmark on the government refraining it from providing resources to
recapitalize the troubled bank. As this bank has now been recapitalized by a foreign investor, this benchmark is
no longer relevant and the authorities request that it be removed from the program.

10
payments arrears accumulated in 1998–2004 was slowed because the authorities were not
clear about the procurement policies of some donors.
15.
During the review the authorities expressed concern about the delays in foreign
budget support and the constraints of the adjustor for any shortfalls.7 The authorities,
viewing the adjustor as potentially disruptive to smooth execution of the budget, suggested
modifications to allow short-term borrowing from commercial banks. They do recognize the
need to undertake fiscal adjustments to address the shortfalls in foreign financing, which may
not be temporary, and their financing options are limited.8 Authorities and staff agreed that, if
necessary, any shortfalls in foreign budget support could be offset by slowing the execution
of domestically financed capital expenditures, which is itself being affected by a downward
revision to foreign project grants later this year (Table 3). For its part, the staff encouraged
donors to better coordinate aid and the government to strengthen the lines of communication
and dialogue with all donors, and ensure that its program commitments are fulfilled.
B. Short-Term Outlook
16.
The short-term outlook is generally favorable and there is an upside risk, if the
disbursement of aid inflows are higher than programmed this year:
•

It appears that positive momentum will continue in 2007, with real GDP growth of
about 4 percent led by private investment in mining and telecommunications, net
exports, and an improvement in rural incomes linked to intensification of some
agricultural activities. Indeed, growth could even be higher if the aid inflows
projected for earlier this year are disbursed; this would lead to higher public
investment and boost aggregate demand.

•

If food prices continue to moderate, inflation should fall to the CEMAC convergence
criterion of 3 percent.

•

The external current account deficit is likely to widen to about 4 percent of GDP,
mainly because of lower official transfers (project-related grants).

•

The government’s 2007 fiscal objectives are achievable; the assumptions for aid
flows in the revised program are on the conservative side.

7

The program provides for a downward adjustment to the floor on the domestic primary balance of up to CFAF
3 billion per quarter for any shortfall in programmed foreign grants or budget support, with a cumulative annual
ceiling on the downward adjustment of CFAF 6 billion.
8

As the C.A.R. is currently at the limit of its statutory advances from the central bank and there is no treasury
bill market, the only domestic financing available is commercial bank borrowing with interest rates of 15–
20 percent.

11
III. ENHANCING EXTERNAL VIABILITY
17.
Because the C.A.R. is a member of CEMAC, the authorities recognize that they
could enhance the external viability of the currency union through policies to raise
growth, which could expand the country’s tax base and allow it to meet its domestic and
external obligations. The development of the C.A.R. significantly lags its CEMAC partners
(Figure 3). While high potential growth is not in general a precondition for domestic and
external viability, in the case of the C.A.R. (and probably other post-conflict economies),
high growth and poverty reduction policies are necessary to restore domestic stability and
reduce risks that could affect the sustainability of the fixed exchange rate regime.
18.
The Article IV discussions therefore centered on the nexus between potential
growth and external viability. This comprised (i) an assessment of how consistent the
government’s medium-term growth and poverty reduction policies are with the stability of
the CEMAC region, (ii) specific policies to promote growth, including measures to promote
sub-regional integration, and (iii) the medium-term fiscal strategy for scaling up aid inflows
and implementing the Poverty Reduction Strategy, which the authorities will complete
shortly.
A. Domestic and External Stability
19.
Over a long period, the C.A.R. openness to trade has been declining and its
export base narrowing, contributing to chronic external current account deficits. The
authorities suggested that these deficits are not heavily influenced by movements in or the
current level of the REER, which has been relatively stable for several years; the problem is
the limited ability of the country to compete and to penetrate export markets. They viewed
large external current account deficits as a consequence of misguided past policies, minimal
national savings, poor quality of human capital, and inadequate infrastructure (in particular,
roads and energy). The recent appreciation of the REER was a concern, especially since
major exports are priced in US dollars, but they agreed with the staff assessment that the
REER was probably in line with its fundamental determinants (Box 1), and it was noted that
the real appreciation has coincided with the post-war improvement in economic conditions
and prospects, including strong export growth.
20.
In 2006, gross official reserves declined by about US$17 million (from 10.6 to
7.3 months of import cover), something that could not be explained solely by the
current account deficit. The staff suggested that a significant narrowing of interest-rate
differentials between the C.A.R. and the euro area (to which the CFA franc is fixed) may be
providing incentives for capital outflows (Figure 4). 9 Instead, the authorities explained the
recent behavior of net foreign assets in terms of weaknesses in capacity, and in particular the
need to better control repatriation of export proceeds.
9

The regional central bank, BEAC, sets a maximum lending rate and a minimum deposit rate for banks in the
CEMAC region. However, because there are insufficient lending opportunities, bank deposit rates rarely deviate
from the minimum.

Box 1. Actual and Equilibrium Real Effective Exchange Rates in the C.A.R
The staff examined the relationship between the C.A.R.’s REER and its long-term equilibrium level to
test for significant misalignment, using the multivariate cointegration procedures developed by Johansen
(1995). Using annual observations for 1980 through 2006, the study tests for a cointegrating (long-run)
relationship between the REER, the terms of trade (TOT), openness to trade (OPEN), government
consumption (GOVCY), technological progress (TPROG), and net foreign assets (NFAY):1
ln(REER) = 0.9 ln(TOT) - 0.1 ln(OPEN) + 0.6 ln(GOVCY) - 0.06 TPROG + 0.01NFAY
Except for TPROG all the variables have the expected sign, but OPEN and NFAY were found not to be
statistically significant.
The results are consistent with
those for the CEMAC region as
a whole (see the recent staff
report on Common Policies of
Member Countries, June 2007): a
period of deteriorating
competitiveness before the 1994
devaluation of the CFA franc;
improving competitiveness
through 2001, and a deterioration
in competitiveness since. At the
end of 2006, the REER was
above its estimated equilibrium,
but the estimated deviation is not
statistically significant.

The strong export growth that took place in 2006 (15 percent increase in volumes), suggests that the
REER has not been an obstacle in the short term. However, over the medium term, improving the
C.A.R.’s international competitiveness will depend on removing a number of factors that raise business
costs, such as the lack of an adequate road network, which is a key impediment in a land-locked country,
costly freight and insurance charges, reflecting security concerns, problems with reliable energy, and the
high cost of labor, which is influenced by relatively high public sector wages.

Case of the Central African Republic,” IMF Working Paper, WP/06/303.

B. Accelerating Growth
21.
If the C.A.R. is to accelerate growth and regain competitiveness in international
markets, domestic reform efforts must be complemented by scaled-up donor support to
finance public investment in infrastructure and raise the quality and level of the labor
force. The medium-term growth strategy should also encompass measures to increase private
sector development by, for example, enhancing the attractiveness of the C.A.R for foreign
direct investment, improving the business climate, and making credit more widely available.
In the short term, reviving the agriculture sector is important to alleviate poverty; the vast
majority of the population live in rural areas and depend on food and cash crops and
livestock for their livelihood.

14
Medium-Term Fiscal Strategy
22.
The authorities agreed that a medium-term fiscal strategy is becoming urgent as
they prepare to implement their PRS and anticipate scaled-up aid inflows. The staff
believe the strategy should be rooted in
fiscal sustainability so that it can provide a

section).

23.
Staff stressed that the relatively low revenue ratio and recent unpredictability of
aid inflows heightened the importance of enhancing efforts to mobilize more domestic
revenue.10 Here, the discussions centered on several measures that could yield significant
resources, such as broadening the tax base by capturing more of the informal sector, ensuring
that all enterprises are registered, eliminating exemptions (which amount to about 0.8 percent
of GDP), and improving taxation of the mining and forestry sectors; intensifying the audit of
medium and large taxpayers; imposing heavy sanctions for noncompliance (tax arrears
amount to about 3 percent of GDP); and rationalizing petroleum-related taxes. A recent FAD
technical assistance report concluded that reform of the current petroleum-pricing regime,
part of the authorities’ program, could provide additional revenue of 0.7–1.8 percent of GDP,
with the range reflecting choices between tax efficiency and equity.11
24.
The authorities recognized the need to further reorient spending and control it
tightly to enhance the credibility and effectiveness of public finances. Nonetheless, they
stressed that the current provision for growth-enhancing and poverty-reducing social
spending is well below what is needed to make progress toward the MDGs. They noted also
that there is growing public impatience with delays in the government’s plans for clearing
10

An assessment of the country’s debt sustainability using the LIC-DSA framework (provided in Annex III of
the joint Fund-Bank Enhanced Heavily Indebted Poor Countries Initiative─Decision Point Document) indicates
that the C.A.R.’s public debt is sustainable, provided that the envisaged improvement in domestic revenue
mobilization and (domestic) debt reduction materialize.

11

The authorities intend to implement a new petroleum-product pricing formula with parameters set to ensure
full recovery of all costs, distribution margins, and taxes—one that avoids the need for further budget subsidies
(an end-December 2007 structural performance criterion).

15
domestic payments arrears (accumulated during 1998–2004), and that private sector
development is unlikely to take place until dilapidated infrastructure is rehabilitated.
Acknowledging the difficult financial environment facing the C.A.R., staff urged the
authorities to accelerate efforts to strengthen public financial management (in particular,
treasury operations and cash-flow management, implementing the new budget nomenclature,
and better controlling payrolls); push to reach the HIPC completion point to benefit from
debt relief as soon as possible; and finalize the PRSP to ensure a firm foundation for
soliciting donor assistance in the roundtable planned for late October of this year.
Tapping Financial Markets
25.
The authorities took the opportunity to clarify their intentions concerning the
possibility of accessing the CEMAC financial market on commercial terms by issuing
bonds, as some countries in the West African Economic and Monetary Union are
doing.12 The authorities explained that issuing bonds could help improve debt sustainability
by refinancing C.A.R. domestic bank debt on more favorable terms, and to complement
donor resources to finance the country’s vast investment needs. The staff acknowledged that
refinancing relatively high cost commercial bank debt with this bond could improve debt
sustainability, but that the amounts envisaged under the authorities’ proposal went well
beyond this, with adverse implications for the fiscal position. The staff and the authorities
agreed to revisit this issue at a later stage, and in the meantime, the authorities indicated that
they would not proceed with this proposal.13
Scaling Up Aid Inflows
26.
The authorities estimate that achieving annual growth of about 7–8 percent over
the medium term would require US$1.25 billion (about 75 percent of GDP) in aid over
the period 2008-10.14 Their priority infrastructure projects are to improve the road network
that links the country with transit points for merchandise, which would reduce the
transportation costs associated with international trade; construct roads to open up the interior
of the country, the isolation of which inhibits the development of the agricultural sector;
rehabilitate the electrical utility (only 3 percent of the population has access to electricity);
and extend the supply of potable water and sanitation facilities to the interior, which would
have a predictable impact on the health of the poorest among of the population.

12

The authorities envisaged an initial bond offering of CFAF 45 billion (about 0.5 percent of GDP), with an
interest rate of about 8 percent per annum, which is lower than the interest charges on statutory advances from
the central bank (10 percent) and short-term borrowing from commercial banks (15-20 percent).
13

Also, the staff encouraged the authorities to seek technical assistance to better understand the modalities of
such borrowing, and to enhance debt management to ensure its consistency with debt sustainability.
14

In late October 2007, the C.A.R. government will present its finalized PRSP at a donor roundtable. The
financial assistance pledged during this roundtable will be an important input both for planning the 2008 budget
and for the medium-term growth strategy.

16
27.
While staff did not challenge the estimates of aid needed to finance priority
investment projects, it did raise concerns about capacity constraints. Staff noted that the
authorities’ resource requirements were about 12 times the amount of donor assistance
committed this year and stressed that the pace of scaling up would need to take account of
the country’s absorptive capacity in terms of both macroeconomic and institutional
constraints (see Box 2). On the macroeconomic side, the “speed limit” would be set by how
quickly the productive capacity of the country could grow; if the limit is exceeded, internal
disequilibrium would follow, probably in the form of much higher inflation that would hit the
poor and the vulnerable hardest. On the institutional side, the country would need to build
sufficient administrative and implementation capacity to spend scaled-up inflows
productively. The authorities acknowledged these capacity constraints and indicated their
intention to address them in their PRSP.
Box 2. The Medium-Term Outlook and Capacity Constraints
While there is little doubt about the need for scaling up aid inflows to accelerate growth and alleviate
poverty in the C.A.R., there is some question about the pace of inflows. The authorities estimate that
financing the PRSP over 2008–10 would require aid inflows about 12 times the amount of foreign
disbursements projected for 2007.
Clearly, the pace of scaling up will be limited by absorptive capacity. During the discussions, the
authorities’ “dynamic medium-term scenario” was assessed alongside the staff’s alternative and
“capacity-constrained scenario.” There were some important differences.
In the authorities’ scenario, growth accelerates from 8.4 percent in 2008 to 11.4 percent in 2010, largely
from a substantial increase in public investment; indeed, the public-investment to GDP ratio rises from
less than 10 percent currently to above 30 percent. The staff scenario has GDP growth increasing
moderately to about 6½ percent over the medium term, supported by a much smaller increase in public
investment.
To derive the capacity constrained scenario, the staff considered (i) the potential supply response to
additional capital accumulation using an aggregate production function, (ii) scope for (and limits to)
expanding human capital (given the limited supply of skilled labor), and (iii) broad institutional capacity.
The experience of other sub-Saharan countries with scaling up also provided guidance; for nearly all of
all these countries, capacity constraints led to only a gradual rise in the investment-GDP ratio, which is
reflected in the staff’s scenario.

Improving the Business Climate
28.
The shortage of national savings and the limitations of the labor force heighten
the need for a business-friendly environment to create incentives for private sector
development and to attract foreign direct investment. The authorities are well aware of
this challenge and, with the assistance of development partners like the World Bank, have
responded to a number of perceived shortcomings, such as the lack of consultations with
stakeholders on such policy issues as reform of customs, restructuring of the petroleum
sector, and telecommunications regulations; transparency in policy implementation (for
example, in the growth-critical natural resource sector); the high cost of doing business; and
the need to enhance governance and combat corruption. Actions to address these
shortcomings include establishing a permanent framework for consultation with the private
sector (chaired by the Prime Minister); setting up a one-stop window in the Chamber of
Commerce to ease regulatory red tape; reinforcing regulation of forestry and mining
activities to remove discretion and ensure transparency and legal security; drafting a
procurement code that incorporates international best practices; fully adopting the OHADA
business laws and providing adequate resources to the Ministry of Justice to fight
commercial and financial crime; and resolving problems with recent legislation to reform the
petroleum-product sector (which could adversely affect supply and prospective investment),
and increasing the sector’s fiscal contribution.
29.
The discussions also highlighted the importance of making credit available to the
private sector. Currently, about two-thirds of all domestic credit is extended to the
government, which is an attractive client because it is willing to pay relatively high interest
(15–20 percent a year) and has no longstanding arrears to commercial banks; also
nonperforming loans of the government or its enterprises do not require provisioning. The
authorities agreed that there are few incentives for the commercial banks to seek private
sector business or to assess private sector risks. An FSAP country module for the C.A.R. to
be undertaken shortly will be an opportunity for World Bank and Fund staff to discuss
measures to address these issues fully.
Intensifying Sub-Regional Integration
30.
The authorities informed the staff of their close involvement in a number of subregional initiatives and institutional reforms that could enhance growth in the CEMAC
area. From the C.A.R. perspective, the most important are
•

Efforts to facilitate the free movement of goods and people, liberalization of services
by reducing non-tariff barriers, introducing a CEMAC passport, and harmonizing
business regulations;

•

Investment in sub-regional infrastructure (transportation, telecommunications,
energy); and

18
•

Reform of the central bank and improvements in liquidity management by replacing
statutory advances with treasury bills and moving to a single treasury account at the
central bank for each CEMAC member.

The staff encouraged the authorities to pursue these initiatives vigorously with their CEMAC
partners: closer integration could help the C.A.R. diversify its export base in an expanding
market; rehabilitating the sub-regional infrastructure could enhance competitiveness by
reducing transportation costs; and a move to treasury bills could reduce costs and help
alleviate the government’s cash-flow concerns. Moreover, the C.A.R. would not be expected
to provide additional financing for these initiatives beyond the current community integration
tax. 15
31.
While recognizing the importance of regional integration, the staff also
encouraged the authorities to move with its CEMAC partners to lower barriers to
trade. The staff noted that both the Diagnostic Trade Integration Study and the World Trade
Organization’s Report on the C.A.R.’s trade policies stressed the distortions caused by the
relatively high common external tariff (CET). With an average applied tariff of 18.2 percent,
the CET is much higher than in the rest of sub-Saharan Africa. In addition, the C.A.R.
applies a derogation to the community’s free trade arrangement that allows it to treat imports
of selected products from CEMAC partners as originating outside the sub-region. In the
staff’s view, rationalizing and lowering tariff barriers on a wider front could be an important
step to gain access to regional as well as global markets.
Capacity Building
32.
The authorities recognize that smooth implementation of their financial and
economic reform program relies heavily on timely and effective technical assistance
from development partners. During the discussions, staff and authorities took stock of the
technical assistance being provided (some through the Central AFRITAC) to identify overlap
and ensure that priority needs are being covered. There was agreement that further assistance
is required to accelerate public financial management, and tax and customs administration
reform (Table 9).16
IV. STAFF APPRAISAL
33.
In 2006, real GDP growth reached its highest level in a decade—a clear sign that
the authorities’ efforts to consolidate peace and security, pursue macroeconomic
stabilization, and undertake structural reform are paying off, even as financial

15

In addition to the community integration tax, financing will also come from oil revenue from the five oilproducing members.
16

FAD will shortly undertake a technical assessment mission and provide recommendations in each of these
areas.

19
conditions continue to be difficult. The recent reengagement of the international financial
community has helped, but foreign aid has been unpredictable and insufficient.
34.
Delays in foreign assistance have made it harder for the authorities to implement
the economic and financial program supported by Fund resources, but they are
demonstrating a firm resolve to achieve their policy objectives. However, ownership
alone is not sufficient for a smooth and successful program. To grow enough to effectively
fight poverty, the country must invest heavily to rebuild its physical and human capital. This
will require substantial donor resources in support of the country’s reform efforts. And it
must build capacity, also with technical assistance, to better absorb scaled-up aid.
35.
Clearly, a recovery of private sector activity will be required to sustain higher
growth. In this regard, creating a more favorable environment for investment is critical. Key
private sector reforms include updating forestry and mining legislation, fully implementing
OHADA business laws, and combating corruption. The goal should be to discuss policy
options and issues fully with stakeholders to ensure transparency about intentions and
objectives, design measures that reflect best practice, and implement them in a fair and
consistent manner.
36.
In the current economic and financial environment, the authorities must remain
vigilant in expenditure control and move more aggressively to better mobilize domestic
resources. On spending, there is little room to maneuver. Unfortunately, any shortfalls in
financing must be met by slowing the execution of capital expenditure, with adverse
medium-term consequences for growth and poverty reduction. On domestic revenue, there is
scope for collecting more but tough political decisions will be necessary to broaden the tax
base and restructure some taxes (particularly for petroleum products).
37.
Continuing structural reform is critical to enhancing competitiveness, given the
CEMAC’s fixed exchange rate regime. While the REER appears broadly in line with its
fundamental determinants a significant upward movement could harm C.A.R.
competitiveness.
38.
Intensifying sub-regional integration would help leverage the benefits of strong
CEMAC performance and create opportunities for the C.A.R. to enhance its
competitiveness. The free movement of people and goods, the removal of nontariff barriers
to trade, and upgrading subregional infrastructure will help the C.A.R. overcome the
disadvantages of being landlocked and help it access an expanding market. But regional
relations should not come at the expense of global integration and the opening of the C.A.R.
and its CEMAC partners to all exports.
39.
The staff recommends completion of the first review of the PRGF arrangement, the
financing assurances review, disbursement of the second loan in an amount equivalent to

Treasury’s control over all remaining accounts, in anticipation of a move to a single Treasury account;
and accounting fully for all government tax collections and receipts.
• Regularize revenue repatriation from local/regional governments to the central government.
• Establishing a medium-term expenditure framework.
Tax administration
• Update the list of large enterprises and increase the intensity of audits to reduce tax evasion.

APPENDIX
Bangui, September 7, 2007
Mr. Rodrigo de Rato
Managing Director
International Monetary Fund
700 19th Street, NW
Washington, DC 20431
USA
Dear Managing Director:
1.
The authorities of the Central African Republic appreciate the international financial
community’s ongoing efforts to provide much needed financial and technical assistance in a
coordinated effort to consolidate peace and security, support our economic and financial
reform program, and rehabilitate the economic infrastructure.
2.
The Fund’s assistance under the Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility (PRGF)
arrangement has been particularly helpful; in facilitating a recent debt rescheduling with
Paris Club creditors on highly favorable terms, and paving the way for the Central African
Republic to reach the decision point under the enhanced Heavily Indebted Poor Countries
(HIPC) Initiative. This initiative is critical to alleviating the external debt burden, which is
weighing heavily on our financial position.
3.
The implementation of our program has been challenging so far, partly because it will
take time to strengthen institutional and administrative capacity. Furthermore, a lower level
of programmed aid inflows has had adverse implications for program performance, although
we have taken the necessary measures to try to offset the decline in these resources to ensure
that our overall fiscal policy objectives continue to be achieved.
4.
To complete the first review of our Fund-supported program, we are requesting the
waiver of three quantitative performance criteria at end-June 2007.
•

Wages and salaries exceeded slightly the program target (CFAF 17.7 billion,
compared with CFAF 17.5 billion), because of some unbudgeted compensation
payments to retirees. We anticipate further retirements and additional compensation
payments, implying a further small increase in the wage bill over the rest of this year.
To ensure that we remain within the annual budgeted wage ceiling, we will accelerate
the process of job reclassification to resolve improper grading, reduce salaries where
credentials cannot be justified, and eliminate unjustified benefits, which should lead
to the required savings of about CFAF 440 million.

•

The envisaged (net) repayment by the government to the commercial banking system
did not materialize and instead further borrowing occurred through end-June. This

32
was due to (i) the government’s decision to facilitate the recapitalization by a foreign
investor of a troubled commercial bank by paying government-guaranteed liabilities
of wholly state-owned enterprises to that bank (equivalent to about 0.3 percent of
GDP); and (ii) the use of a small amount of commercial bank financing to make up
for a delay in foreign assistance, to begin the planned clearance of domestic payments
arrears in the cotton sector.
•

Also, because the recapitalization of the commercial bank is recorded as a transfer in
the budget, this transaction led to a slightly lower domestic primary surplus than
programmed (by about 0.1 percent of GDP). The government continued to maintain
tight control over spending, but was not able to fully offset this transaction because
the budget is already compressed, and only provides for a minimal level of public
services.

5.
To accommodate the fiscal impact of the government’s decision to facilitate the
recapitalization of the commercial bank and account for additional domestic interest
payments on domestic debt (equivalent to CFAF 3.5 billion)─partly caused by the delay in
foreign financing and the recourse to relatively costly commercial bank borrowing─we
request the modification of the performance criterion at end-December 2007 on (i) the floor
on the domestic primary balance and (ii) the change in net claims of the commercial banking
system on the government. The revised targets are presented in Table 1 (attached). A key
priority of our economic program is to regularize relations with all of our creditors; in this
connection, we have raised the floor on the domestic primary surplus by a small amount
(CFAF 900 million, or about 0.1 percent of GDP) to ensure timely payment of our domestic
debt service. An unanticipated increase in non-tax revenue (from telecommunication fees)
has provided sufficient resources to accommodate the higher debt service. In the same vein,
we continue to place priority on reducing our liabilities to commercial banks, although recent
developments have slowed the envisaged repayment, which is now targeted at 2 billion
CFAF at end-December 2007 (0.2 percent of GDP), compared with CFAF 4.4 billion earlier.
6.
We continued to make progress in structural reform and the program’s five structural
performance criteria were completed, although two with a slight delay. For one
measure─concerning the external audit of the operations of the one-stop customs window in
Douala─the delay was caused by donor coordination problems, which led the government to
finance the audit itself to avoid further slippage. For the other measure─concerning the
validation of domestic payments arrears, which accrued during the period 1998-2004─the
delay was due to our limited understanding of some donor procurement procedures. In this
regard, we request the waiver of these two structural performance criteria. In addition, since
the recapitalization of the troubled bank is now completed, the structural benchmark
refraining the government from providing further resources is no longer relevant, and we
request its removal from the program.
7.
We have made determined efforts to implement our PRGF arrangement under
difficult financial conditions. Given our tight budget constraint, the unpredictability of aid
inflows pose the main risk to our program, as this would result in a decline in public

33
investment with adverse consequences for medium-term growth and poverty reduction.
Nonetheless, we will not take any actions inconsistent with our program, including accessing
the sub-regional financial market to finance development at this time. We hope that
completing the first program review and reaching the HIPC decision point will provide a
further catalyst for a scaling up of aid inflows, and we expect that additional highlyconcessional assistance should be forthcoming during a donor roundtable planned for endOctober 2007. During this roundtable, we will present our key policies and priorities to
enhance growth and alleviate poverty, as described in the Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper,
which is now being finalized.
8.
The government of the Central African Republic believes that the policies and
measures set forth in the Memorandum of Economic and Financial Policies of November 30,
2006 continue to be adequate to achieve the objectives of the program, but we will take any
further measures that may become appropriate for that purpose. During the implementation
of the arrangement, we will consult with Fund staff on the adoption of any measures that may
be appropriate, at the initiative of the government or whenever the Fund staff requests such a
consultation.
9.
The government intends to make the contents of this letter as well as the staff report
accompanying its request for completion of the first review of the program, available to the
public and authorizes the IMF to arrange for them to be posted on the IMF website,
subsequent to Executive Board approval of its request.
10.
The second review under the PRGF arrangement is expected to be completed by
April 30, 2008.

APPENDIX II. CENTRAL AFRICAN REPUBLIC: RELATIONS WITH THE WORLD BANK GROUP
(As of July 5, 2007)
1.
World Bank assistance to the Central African Republic (CAR) was disrupted by the
recurrent conflicts during much of the past decade as well as arrears to IDA from January
2002-November 2006. The presidential and parliamentary elections in March and May 2005
marked the end of a two-year political transition, following a coup d’état in March 2003, and
were generally deemed to have been satisfactorily conducted. The Bank’s objective over the
past two years has been to help the CAR design and implement a framework to guide the
country’s recovery and longer-term development and poverty reduction efforts, and pave the
way for a coordinated settlement of external arrears by multilateral creditors and increased
volumes of donor financing. This has now been done and the Bank is now working with the
international community to help the CAR move from a situation of crisis and emergency
towards reconstruction and longer term economic recovery.
The Bank Group strategy in lending and non-lending activities
2.
The World Bank and African Development Bank (AfDB) strategy and program in
CAR is outlined in a joint Interim Strategy Note for FY07–08.
3.
The World Bank currently has four active projects in its portfolio totaling
US$148 million. The portfolio consists of a Reengagement and Institution Building Support
Program Grant (US$82 million) approved in November 2006, which cleared the country’s
arrears to the Bank, paving the way for resumed IDA. This project also provided budget
support and focused on strengthening Governance and Natural Resource Management. An
Emergency Urban Infrastructure Rehabilitation and Maintenance (US$18 million) was
approved in May 2007 to rapidly rehabilitate, restore, improve and expand sustainable access
to basic infrastructure services for the population of the most deprived districts of Bangui.
A Regional Trade & Transportation Facilitation Project (US$24 million) approved in June
2007 aims to facilitate regional trade between Chad, Cameroon and CAR and improve their
access to world markets through improving the implementation of the CEMAC Customs
Union, and reducing barriers along the Douala-Bangui corridor. An HIV/AIDS project
(US$17 million) that was in the portfolio when the country went into non-accrual status was
restructured in May 2007 to expand its scope to include health and education emergency
support. A second project funded by the Low Income Countries Under Stress (LICUS) Trust
Fund (US$6.8 million) approved in October 2006 is also under implementation, covering
Public Financial Management (PFM), Mining, Community Driven Development, HIV/AIDS
and PFM aspects of Security. A third LICUS grant is under preparation.
4.
The Bank is also providing several pieces of analytical and advisory assistance
(AAA). AAA completed in FY07 include a Diagnostic Trade Integration Study; a Country
Financial Accountability Assessment; Country Procurement Issues Paper; Poverty Report;
and Education Country Status Report. The Bank is also providing support to the PRSP, TA

6
on Customs and support for debt relief. A Public Expenditure Review and Rural Sector
Strategy are planned.
IMF-World Bank collaboration in specific areas
5.
The World Bank has worked closely with the IMF on the reform program in the
CAR, and generally share the same views on policy issues. There is broad agreement on the
core reform program in the CAR, namely: (i) reinforcement of public expenditure and public
payroll management; (ii) revenue mobilization and improvement of tax and custom
administration; (iii) improving governance and transparency; and (iv) improving the delivery
of public services, including education and health.

6.
The Government has advanced in its preparation of the (full) PRSP, which is in the
process of finalization, with assistance from UNDP. The Bank is working closely with the
UNDP and the Government on the PRSP process, and has scaled up its support to ensure that
the PRSP will provide the requisite medium-term framework with sufficient depth and
breadth of coverage of the country’s recovery and longer term development and poverty
reduction needs. The Bank has also added support to ensure that the PRSP document would
include a monitoring and evaluation mechanism, as well as a comprehensive participation of
major stakeholders. In the meantime, the Government has prepared (August 06) an Economic
and Social Policy Framework (ESPF), supported by Government Matrix of Priority actions
as well as a Reconstruction Strategy presented to the International Community at a donors
meeting in June 2007.
7.
To assist demobilization and socio-economic reintegration of ex-combatants into
their home communities, the Bank approved the Reintegration of Ex-combatants and Support

7
to Communities Special Project in an amount of US$9.8 million in April 2004. The project,
funded through the Multi-Donor Trust Fund (MDTF) of the Multi-Country Demobilization
and Reintegration Program (MDRP), closed in February 2007. Its objectives were to
contribute to the overall stability of the country by (i) demobilizing ex-combatants and
reintegrating them socially and economically back into their community; (ii) strengthening
the capacity of communities of return to ensure the sustainable reintegration of the excombatants; and (iii) supporting projects on security and conflict prevention in communities
that are most affected by security problems. This work is being followed up through the
security component of LICUS2 and a multidonor effort in security sector reform.
9.
To support the emergency rehabilitation of at least 80 communities in four
prefectures (Kemo, Ouaka, Kemo, Basse Kotto and Mbomou), the Bank has signed a Grant
agreement with an international NGO and with the Government in an amount of US$2.75 million. The project is funded entirely through the LICUS TF and is expected to establish a
model for a community-driven approach that helps build social capital, provide critical social
services, and restart some level of economic activity in the selected communities.
Areas in which the World Bank leads and its analysis serves as input into the IMFsupported programs
10
The Bank is taking the lead on laying the groundwork for the preparation of a
medium term structural reform framework in the context of the PRSP. In addition to the
LICUS Trust Fund activities, the Bank has continued to engage in analytical and advisory
work. In collabo-ration with other partners, it prepared a set of Policy Notes, focusing on key
thematic areas including security, natural resource management, social sectors and public
finance. The IMF has a strong interest in the financial sector from a macroeconomic
perspective, including growth and the monitoring of quasi-fiscal deficits and contingent
public liabilities, as well as an interest in governance and transparency issues in natural
resources management.
11.
During 2006, the Bank has also prepared a report on public procurement (CPIP), on
trade (DTIS) and on public finance management (CFAA). In the latter area, reports were
prepared on cash management and accounting nomenclature on civil service reform and
payroll control. In the context of the LICUS2 grant, and the Reengagement and InstitutionBuilding Support Program, the Bank funded and is supporting governance-enhancing
activities in the sectors of mining, forestry and telecommunications and in the judicial area.
The objective pursued is to create an environment conducive to private sector development
and to ensure the respect of investors’ rights.
Areas of shared responsibility
12.
The Bank and the IMF are working together to assess debt sustainability and HIPC
eligibility for the C.A.R. The Bank and the IMF are also active in the area of regional
integration. The Bank has been implementing a Regional Assistance Strategy for the
CEMAC countries, including a support to the payments systems, while the IMF has been
active in regional macroeconomic surveillance. An FSAP is expected to be undertaken for
CAR.

8
Areas in which the Fund leads and its analysis serves as input into the World Banksupported programs
13.
The IMF has taken the lead on core macroeconomic and fiscal policies, on revenue
mobilization and the management of aggregate expenditures. The Bank has been working
with the IMF to ensure consistency between its own projects and policy advice and the
overall fiscal framework. In the framework of a donor partnership, the Bank has provided
training and technical assistance to strengthen the CAR public finance administration.
Areas in which the IMF leads and there is no direct World Bank involvement
14.
The IMF has been leading the dialogue on monetary policy, exchange rate
management, and balance of payments issues, although given the nature of the CFA franc
arrangement, there is little scope for policy action in these areas at the national level.
Questions may be addressed to Eric Bell (202-458-7490) or Luc Razafimandimby (202-4589539).

APPENDIX III: CENTRAL AFRICAN REPUBLIC: STATISTICAL ISSUES
1.
The statistical database is adequate for surveillance purposes but it suffers from
weaknesses due to years of neglect, inadequate resources, and various conflicts. On the basis
of the 1999 multi-sector statistical mission, efforts were initiated to improve the national
statistical system including through adopting an statistics law and setting up a National
Statistical Board in 2001.
2.
With the support of a statistics expert mission during January 26–February 13, 2004,
the Central African Republic (C.A.R.) became a participant in the GDDS and first posted
metadata on the IMF’s Dissemination Standards Bulletin Board (DSBB) on June 14, 2004.
However, most of the metadata, excluding for financial sector statistics, has not been updated
and certified. Issues of source data, compilation, and dissemination affect all sectors, but are
particularly severe in the areas of the real sector, government finance, and external trade.
Real sector
3.
The compilation of national accounts is the responsibility of the General Directorate
of Statistics and Economic and Social Studies (DGSEES) of the Ministry of Finance. The
1999 multisector mission found serious deficiencies in the institutional arrangements for
compiling statistics as well as weaknesses in data collection procedures and compilation
techniques. The authorities should continue efforts to improve the quality of national
accounts estimates and the reporting of quarterly foreign trade data. At the same time,
revisions are needed for the wholesale and the consumer price indices as the limited coverage
and the obsolescence of the weights used in compiling these indices cast serious doubts on
their accuracy.
4.
A statistical expert visit in mid-2005 found a serious resource gap at the DGSEES
and recommended a number of measures, particularly the redeployment of resources to
strengthen the national accounts area. There is an urgent need to develop source data, by
conducting surveys, particularly for the subsistence agriculture sector which represents an
estimated 30 percent of the economy. In addition, estimates of activity in the informal sector
are still based on a 1982 survey. In the manufacturing sector, estimation is based on an
outdated list of enterprises and likely overestimates activity, given that many of these
enterprises either do not exist or have reduced their production considerably. There is the
pressing need to update the business register through a survey of enterprises and to reinstate
publication of the industrial production index.
Government finance
5.
The 1999 multisector statistics mission noted that there was no single primary data
source that could be used for the production of government finance statistics and that the
available information was not communicated to the Ministry of Finance. In February 2004, a
mission underscored that, in order to establish a systematic compilation of government
finance statistics, substantial additional assistance will be required, notably in the area of
Treasury accounting and expenditure management, with a view to producing reliable source
data and improving the accuracy of the measures of domestic arrears. The mission made

10
specific recommendations toward this objective, and a subsequent March 2004 FAD mission
confirmed and reinforced these recommendations. Support in this area is provided by an
FAD public expenditure management advisor currently stationed in the Central African
Republic. A follow-up STA mission in mid-2005 reviewed recent developments and
proposed further steps in the framework of the earlier action plan for improving the source
data for the compilation of the government financial operations table (Tableau des
Opérations Financières de l’État, TOFE) and for further development and use of the Treasury
cash plan.
Monetary accounts
6.
Monthly data for the C.A.R., as well as for the other members of the Central African
Economic and Monetary Community (CEMAC), are regularly reported to the Fund in
electronic form by the Bank of Central African States (BEAC). Accuracy of data on currency
in circulation is affected by large cross-border movements of currency among CEMAC
member countries. Only 30 percent of banknotes issued in the C.A.R. by the BEAC National
Directorate remain in the territory, 49 percent circulate in Cameroon and about 16 percent in
Chad, while currency in circulation in the C.A.R. includes some 6 percent of banknotes from
Republic of Congo, 6 percent of banknotes from Cameroon, and 4 percent of banknotes from
Gabon.
7.
The monetary and financial statistics (MFS) mission in October 2006 assisted the
authorities in assessing consistency between government finance statistics (bank financing)
and monetary statistics (net position of the government). The mission also provided guidance
in migrating to the new Standardized Report Forms (SRFs) for the submission of monetary
statistics to STA, and helped update the metadata for the financial sector posted on the IMF
website within the framework of the GDDS. However, the BEAC has yet to submit, for any
of its member countries, test data using the SRFs. Key recommendations from the MFS
mission included: (i) expansion of monetary statistics to include the largest microfinance
institution in the country (Crédit mutuel de Centrafrique); (ii) finalization and
implementation of the updated sectorized list of public entities to improve accuracy of
monetary statistics and consistency with GFS; and (iii) verification of the reliability of source
data reported by commercial banks through the new electronic reporting system.
Balance of payments
8.
As in other CEMAC countries, the agency responsible for the compilation of balance
of payments statistics is the Balance of Payments Unit of the national agency of the BEAC.
Past delays with data compilation and dissemination, which were mainly related to the
transition from the fourth to the fifth edition of the Balance of Payments Manual, have been
addressed through the recent implementation of methodological improvements. The last
complete reporting, prepared by the national balance of payments committee, covered 2002
annual data. Preliminary statements for 2003–05 are available from the national BEAC office
in Bangui, and have been transmitted to the African Department. However, balance of
payments data are transmitted to the Statistics Department only through 1994.

11
9.
The 1999 multisector mission also provided a thorough assessment of needs in
balance of payments statistics. Efforts have been made to address some of the problems
identified by the mission, including training, compilation system, and development of a
flexible questionnaire. Nonetheless, problems remain and the main issues concern data
sources, including the need to update the BOP survey (list of respondents, reporting forms,
and codification). Various methodologies or statistical techniques need to be reviewed, such
as the computation of freight and insurance and procedures for attributing banknote
movements among transactions. The timeliness of the biannual balance of payments
(presently 90 days) needs to be improved.
External and domestic debt
10.
External and domestic debt statistics are compiled by the Debt Directorate of the
Ministry of Finance. The quality of data needs to be significantly improved and efforts have
been underway to verify with creditors the stock of external debt outstanding and of external
arrears. Similarly, domestic debt data are of poor quality, due in part to the difficulty of
monitoring public expenditure on a commitment basis. However, the actual stock of
government domestic arrears has been verified by a working group, with the help of a World
Bank consultant. The reconciliation process was completed in June 2007, with 99 percent of
the multilateral, bilateral and commercial debt as of end-2006 reconciled. The Debt
Directorate is currently seeking funding and technical expertise to upgrade their outdated
debt data management software.

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2007 Article IV Consultation with the
Central African Republic
On September 28, 2007, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF)
concluded the Article IV consultation with the Central African Republic (C.A.R.).1
Background
Over the past several decades political struggle and armed conflict have adversely affected
domestic stability in the C.A.R., slowing growth and causing a deterioration of living standards.
The economy has also been buffeted by exogenous shocks, such as droughts and regional
instability, and a long-term decline in the terms of trade. A coup d’état in 2003, followed by
elections in 2005, marked the end of generalized conflict and the beginning of economic and
institutional recovery.
A recent improvement in the political and social situation and economic policies has provided a
firm basis for economic recovery. In this context, reengagement of the international financial
community has helped in providing technical assistance to strengthen capacity, but foreign aid
has been unpredictable and insufficient.
For its part, the Fund provided Emergency-Post Conflict Assistance to the C.A.R. in July 2004
and January 2006 and approved a three-year Poverty Reduction Growth Facility (PRGF)
arrangement in December 2006. In March 2007, the Fund’s Board also agreed that the country

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On
return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the
Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the
Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the
country's authorities.

2
is eligible for debt relief under the enhanced Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) Initiative.
The C.A.R. will qualify for the Multilateral Debt Relief Initiative once it reaches the HIPC
completion point.
Real GDP grew by 4.1 percent in 2006, compared with 1.3 percent in 2004 after the conflict
ended. Private consumption and investment picked up, as did diamond and timber exports, and
for the first time in years, agriculture made a modest contribution to growth. Though inflation
was relatively high in 2006, it has declined recently─the 12-month rate was 1.6 percent through
June 2007─as food prices moderated. With strong export growth and higher official transfers
related to recent external arrears clearance, the external current account deficit narrowed
significantly, from about 6½ percent of GDP in 2005 to 2.7 percent last year.
The fiscal position has improved during the past several years, owing to firm expenditure control
and the government’s efforts to enhance domestic revenue mobilization. A strengthening of
public expenditure management and a decline in the civil service wage bill have helped on the
spending side, allowing room for an increase in priority outlays for growth-enhancing and
poverty-reducing social policies. Meanwhile improvements in tax and customs administration
and some new tax measures have supported an increase in the tax revenue ratio, which,
however, remains low compared with other low-income countries. Together, these factors have
led to a decline in the overall fiscal balance (excluding grants) from about 8½ percent of GDP in
2005 to 4.7 percent in 2006, with further consolidation projected for this year.
The authorities are making progress on structural reform. Along with efforts to enhance public
expenditure management and revenue mobilization, the government has taken measures to
improve governance and transparency, address financial and commercial crime, and develop
the private sector through changes to the regulatory framework in the forestry and mining
sectors, and implementing the legal framework supported by the Organization for the
Harmonization of Business Laws in Africa.

Executive Board Assessment
Directors commended the Central African authorities for their recent efforts to consolidate peace
and security, and pursue macroeconomic stabilization and structural reforms. Despite difficult
conditions, performance under the PRGF-supported program was generally satisfactory,
demonstrating the authorities’ commitment to move the economy from post conflict to sustained
recovery. These efforts are beginning to bear fruit as the economic recovery has strengthened
and the base of growth has broadened. However, daunting challenges remain, including
pervasive poverty, susceptibility to shocks, and security and capacity constraints. Looking
ahead, Directors stressed that policies need to focus on accelerating growth and increasing the
economy’s resilience, with the private sector playing an increasing role.
Directors welcomed that real GDP growth recently reached its highest level in a decade and
inflation moderated, which bodes well for the authorities’ fight against poverty. They noted that
problems in donor coordination, which led to delays in aid disbursements, are being addressed,

3
and they welcomed the international community’s reengagement in the Central African
Republic. Directors stressed the need for further financial assistance on highly concessional
terms, together with technical assistance to strengthen capacity, to support the authorities’ firm
resolve to achieve their policy objectives.
Directors agreed with the need to continue with fiscal consolidation to reduce the overhang of
domestic debt and accelerate efforts to mobilize more domestic revenue, especially in light of
the very low tax take. Although the budget provides for only a minimal level of social services,
prudent fiscal management is needed to ensure that domestic payments arrears are settled and
new ones do not emerge, as this has been an important source of past social discontent.
Directors recognized the authorities’ efforts to reform tax and customs administration, but
encouraged them to broaden the tax base─by eliminating exemptions, capturing more of the
informal sector, and improving taxation in the mining and forestry sectors. Strengthening the
management of the natural resources sector, and improving the transparency of the revenues
from natural resources, will be crucial.
Directors took note of the authorities’ interest in tapping the regional financial market to help
improve debt sustainability by refinancing domestic bank debt on more favorable terms. While
acknowledging that there could be potential benefit from such a refinancing operation, most
Directors cautioned against issuing bonds on commercial terms to finance higher expenditures,
in light of the country’s efforts to attain debt sustainability.
Directors concurred with the authorities’ structural reform agenda, which should help enhance
the country’s external viability and accelerate growth through private sector development. In this
context, they stressed the importance of reducing the cost of doing business, enhancing
governance and combating corruption, and updating legislation in key areas such as forestry
and mining to attract investment.
Directors also underlined the need to accelerate structural reforms to improve the country’s
international competitiveness, which is critical under the CEMAC region’s fixed exchange rate
regime. In this context, they welcomed the authorities’ intention—along with their CEMAC
partners—of intensifying regional integration through the free movement of people and goods,
the removal of nontariff barriers to trade, and upgrading the region’s infrastructure. Directors
also encouraged the authorities to aim for further integration in the global economy, through the
liberalization of trade on a wider basis, while seeking ways to diversify the economy.
Directors agreed that the Central African Republic had fulfilled the requirements to reach the
decision point under the enhanced Heavily Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) Initiative, thereby
qualifying for HIPC debt relief. They welcomed the progress achieved in the authorities’
discussions with Paris Club and other bilateral and commercial creditors, and urged all creditors
to participate fully in the debt relief efforts. Directors observed that the Central African Republic
could reach its floating completion point following at least one year’s implementation of its
Poverty Reduction Strategy (which is to be finalized shortly), continued satisfactory performance
under the PRGF arrangement, and implementation of the other HIPC triggers. Directors

4
supported the coverage and content of the HIPC triggers, and urged the authorities to
implement them as soon as possible.

IMF Executive Board Completes First Review Under the PRGF Arrangement with the
Central African Republic and Approves US$4.8 Million Disbursement
The Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) has completed the first
review of the Central African Republic’s economic performance under a program supported
by a three-year Poverty Reduction and Growth Facility (PRGF) arrangement. The completion
of this review enables the Central African Republic to draw an amount equivalent to
SDR 3.1 million (about US$4.8 million).
In completing the review, the Executive Board approved the authorities’ request for waivers
of the non-observance of the quantitative performance criteria on the ceiling on wages, the
floor on domestic primary balance and changes in the net claims of the banking system on
the government, as well as of the structural performance criteria on the external audits of the
one-stop customs window in Douala and the validation of domestic payment arrears. In
addition, the Executive Board approved a modification of quantitative performance criteria
for December 2007.
The Central African Republic’s PRGF arrangement was approved on December 22, 2006
(see Press Release No 06/299) for an amount equivalent to SDR 36.2 million (about
US$56.4 million). The first disbursement was made in mid- January 2007 in an amount
equivalent to SDR 17.6 million (about US$27.4 million).
Following the Executive Board discussion of the Central African Republic’s economic
performance on September 28, 2007, Mr. Murilo Portugal, Deputy Managing Director and
Acting Chair, made the following statement:
“During the past several years, the Central African authorities have made important progress
in consolidating peace and security and in strengthening economic policies. This progress is
being reflected in an economic recovery that is gathering strength, with real GDP growth last
year reaching the highest rate in over a decade.

2

“The authorities are demonstrating a firm resolve to implement their PRGF arrangement,
under difficult financial conditions. The authorities remain committed to achieving the
program’s overall objectives this year. In this context, the Executive Board supported the
authorities’ request for waivers and modification of the program’s performance criteria.
“Tight control over public expenditure needs to be maintained in the near term to address the
overhang of domestic debt, safeguard the fiscal stance against unpredictable aid inflows, and
prevent the emergence of new payments arrears, which had been a previous source of social
discontent. This should be accompanied by concerted efforts to mobilize more domestic
revenue, through a broadening of the tax base and some new tax measures. An increase in the
tax revenue ratio is needed, but resources must be augmented by more foreign assistance if
the Central African Republic is to make progress toward achieving the Millennium
Development Goals.
“An acceleration of growth could be achieved through structural reform aimed at allowing
the private sector to flourish. The authorities’ focus on reducing the cost of doing business,
enhancing governance and combating corruption, and updating legislation in key areas such
as forestry and mining is on the right track. Also, this would help to improve the country’s
international competitiveness, which is critical under the CEMAC region’s fixed exchange
rate.
“Satisfactory implementation of the authorities’ PRGF-supported program has paved the way
for the Central African Republic to reach the decision point under the enhanced Heavily
Indebted Poor Countries (HIPC) Initiative. The Central African Republic could reach its
floating completion point under the Initiative following at least one year’s implementation of
its Poverty Reduction Strategy (which is to be finalized shortly), continued satisfactory
performance under the PRGF-supported program, and implementation of the other HIPC
triggers. HIPC debt relief will help the Central African Republic achieve debt sustainability,
but it will continue to need foreign assistance on highly concessional terms to finance
development. At the completion point, the country would also benefit from the Multilateral
Debt Relief,” Mr. Portugal said.

Statement by Laurean Rutayisire, Executive Director for the Central African Republic
September 28, 2007
On behalf of my Central African authorities, I would like to express their appreciation to the
Executive Board and to Management for their continued support and policy advice, over the
years. My authorities would also like to thank staff for the quality of the dialogue shared
during the recent consultation in Bangui. They fully recognized that the joint effects of this
involvement at different levels of these institutions have helped them to implement sound
policies, as evidenced by the improvement of the political and social situation, as well as the
building of a solid basis for economic revival, which is well-acknowledged by all
stakeholders. Progress is also being made in the consolidation of peace and security with the
assistance of France and the Central African Economic and Monetary community (CEMAC).
Recent Economic Developments
In the real sector, real GDP has rebounded from the sluggish path recorded before 2003,
growing steadily to 1.3 percent in 2004, 2.2 percent in 2005, and 4.1 percent in 2006. Based
on preliminary assessment of the program during the six first months of the current year, my
authorities expect that in terms of growth rate, 2007 presents as favorable perspective as
2006, in spite of delays in foreign assistance, most of it affecting growth-led area of physical
and human capital, as reported by the staff. This favorable evolution in the real sector was
driven by the dynamics of domestic consumption benefiting from more regular disbursement
of wages for civil servants and other government workers. Agriculture made a slight
contribution to growth for the first time in years, as a result of the revival of the cotton
marketing campaign conducted by the government. In secondary and tertiary sectors, the
activities improved well, taking advantage of the resumption of confidence, in particular in
the subsectors of manufacturing and mobile telephony. As regards the external sector, the
current account deficit narrowed, driven by buoyant export and higher level of FDI.
However, given the extent of balance of payments needs, especially for the rehabilitation of
infrastructure and the delivery of basic services of health and clean water, this positive
external account development has just contributed to improve the profile of external
aggregates, leaving the social conditions still dire. Significant improvements in fiscal
management yielded a primary domestic surplus of about 0.4 percent of GDP, though this
surplus was slightly lower than the projected level of 0.5 percent of GDP. My authorities
have also completed the external audit of the domestic arrears and a strategy of clearing these
arrears is now being discussed with all stakeholders.
Implementing structural reforms progressed steadily, in particular those pertaining to fiscal
area, governance and accountability, business climate, forestry and mining sectors. As
regards fiscal reforms, several measures were taken, including the elimination of fraud and
duplication in the public sector payroll, identification of ghost workers and subsequent
establishment of cleaned database of civil servants and military personnel, introduction of

2
one-stop window for custom administration, reform of judiciary court in order to consider the
cases of financial and commercial crime. Efforts, in the area of tax and customs
administration, aimed at raising the level of revenue collection are underway. Moreover,
efforts towards implementation of the OHADA business laws have been made. As noted in
the joint staff assessment of the PRSP, progress in the preparation of this document has been
substantial. The permanent secretariat, responsible for overseeing PRSP, is fully operational,
gathering considerable experience in guiding the process. The priorities set out in this
document are consistent with the population’s expectations and in line with the objectives of
PRGF program.
Program Performance
As pointed out by staff in its report, my authorities have established satisfactory policy
implementation track. Four of the seven end-June quantitative criteria were observed, among
them the total government revenue, which has been attained with a 2 billion of CFA francs
margin. As for the indicative targets, which set floors for poverty related spending and
domestic arrears reduction, they were also met with comfortable margins. Likewise, all
structural performance criteria and benchmarks were observed, though two with delays.
Regarding the 3 quantitative criteria for which waivers are requested, their occurrence is
mainly due to the government’s financial constraints stemming from the uncertainty of aid
inflows already programmed in the 2007 budget. Indeed, for the criterion related to ‘domestic
primary surplus”, missed by 0.1 percent of GDP, the cause of the slippage stems from the
authorities’ decision to rescue one commercial bank. This operation aimed to avoid the risk
of financial perturbations in CAR banking system, given the strategic position of that bank,
on one hand, and to facilitate the recapitalization of that institution through foreign investors
on the other. The second waiver is requested for the criterion on “net claims of the
commercial banking system on the government” for which the government has contracted a
new loan of CFAF 0.6 billion, instead of reimbursing an amount of CFAF 2 billion. The last
overrun concerned “wages and salaries” for which the criterion was breached by a small
amount of 0.2 billion.
Reaching the decision point of debt relief under the HIPC initiative
As set out in the staff report of March 2007, CAR is eligible for HIPC debt relief. It is an
IDA-only country with per capita GNI of 350$ and is eligible for the foreseeable future for
support from the IMF under the PRGF. CAR’s external public debt and publicly-guaranteed
debt at end-2005 is estimated at US $ 869 millions. After application of traditional debt
relief, the debt amounts to US$ 832 millions which corresponds to 750 percent of exports.
CAR’s external indebtedness is therefore not sustainable and is significantly above the 150
percent of export threshold of the HIPC even after the application of traditional debt
reduction mechanisms.

3
My authorities have fulfilled the conditions required to qualify reaching HIPC decision point
and benefit from interim HIPC debt relief.
i) They have established a satisfactory track record of policy performance under the two
EPCA and they continue to pursue sound economic policies under the PRGF supported
arrangement, as evidenced by the broadly positive conclusion drawn by the staff at the
end of the last mission in Bangui. Under these programs, fiscal policy aimed at exerting
effective controls and redirecting spending towards priority sectors. Looking ahead, my
authorities intend to continue implementing sound policies and a vigorous reform agenda
grounded in the PRSP.
ii) They have a satisfactory poverty reduction strategy in place in the form of I-PRSP. The
latest version of this document was at early September 2007 shared with all stakeholders,
including Bank and Fund staffs. All needed studies on Poverty analyses and participatory
poverty assessment, Diagnostic trade integration analysis, and on the Country financial
accountability assessment, have been completed. The authorities’ priorities set out in the
PRSP are consistent with the aspirations of the population.
iii) CAR’s debt burden indicators are above the HIPC initiative export threshold, as
mentioned in the preceding paragraphs.
My authorities have also concluded with staff on HIPC completion point triggers.
Conclusion
As highlighted above, Central African Republic has made progress since 2003 under EPCA
and now under the PRGF program. My Central African Republic authorities have
implemented these programs under several limited assistance from the international
community. My authorities thank the Fund for continued support and will appreciate Board
approval of this first review of PRGF and reaching HIPC decision point.
