-4EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
Background: Slovenia joined the EU on May 1, 2004. Real GDP growth last year accelerated to 4½ percent,
driven by a positive swing in the contribution of net foreign demand while domestic demand growth
maintained momentum. However, the external current account deficit widened to almost 1 percent of GDP,
owing to a deterioration of the terms of trade. Inflation declined to 3.2 percent at end-2004 and fell further to
2.1 percent in May 2005. Following ERM2 entry on June 28, 2004, the exchange rate stabilized and monetary
conditions tightened. The fiscal deficit, at 1.4 percent of GDP, was lower than envisaged in the budget.
Outlook: Economic growth is likely to moderate to 4 percent in 2005–06, owing to a continued slowdown in
inventory accumulation. The current account deficit is projected to deteriorate further in 2005 but narrow in
2006, in line with anticipated terms of trade developments. The authorities expect average inflation of about
2½ percent in 2005–06. The revised 2005 budget envisages a broadly neutral fiscal stance.
Policy Discussions
Euro adoption: Slovenia is well poised to adopt the euro in early 2007, but risks remain. It meets all the
Maastricht criteria except for the one on inflation. The authorities were more concerned about the upside risk
to the inflation outlook from oil price rises than from faster-than-potential economic growth or increases in
producer prices. If achievement of the Maastricht inflation criterion were at risk, the authorities would take
appropriate corrective measures, including active use of incomes and exchange rate policies. The actual choice
of policy instruments would depend on an assessment of their effectiveness, taking into account the stage in
the assessment period in which an upturn in inflation materialized.
Monetary and exchange rate policy: Under ERM2, the Bank of Slovenia (BoS) will give primacy to
exchange rate stability and keep policy interest rates unchanged until forced otherwise by market conditions.
However, should there be signs before end-2005 of inflation exceeding the projected path, the BoS would
tighten monetary conditions. The staff agreed that, given transmission lags, initiating monetary tightening after
end-2005 might not have a discernible impact on inflation during the assessment period.
Wage policy: The prospects for continued wage moderation in 2005 are good but risks remain from wage
negotiations for 2006 and beyond. The staff noted that greater wage flexibility was paramount for absorbing
asymmetric shocks once in the monetary union, and encouraged the social partners to eliminate wage
indexation and move to a wage-setting system that ensured productivity-based wage differentiation.
Fiscal policy. The staff recommended a more restrictive stance to reduce the risks to the disinflation objective
and put public finances on the consolidation path toward the official medium-term goal of structural balance.
The authorities highlighted EU-related expenditures and unanticipated spending needs as constraining factors.
Medium-term fiscal consolidation efforts would be directed toward reforming social entitlements and health
care and containing the public sector wage bill, but achieving political consensus on some of these measures
was likely to be time consuming. For political reasons, the authorities intend to revert in 2006 from the
existing system of indexing pensions to wages with a lag to the earlier practice of indexing them to current
wage growth. They are also considering a further reduction of payroll taxes with the aim of enhancing
competitiveness. To promote structural balance, the staff advised against both measures.
Banking sector and other structural issues. The banking system is healthy, but exposure of banks to credit
and interest rate risks will need close monitoring. The staff supported the BoS’s intention to classify
outstanding provisions released on account of adopting the IFRS in January 2006 as a component of statutory
reserves. The staff encouraged the authorities to enhance the supervision of insurance companies.
Consideration is being given to further privatization and improving labor market flexibility.

I. BACKGROUND
1.
Slovenia reached two significant milestones in 2004: European Union (EU)
accession on May 1 and ERM2 entry on June 28. The authorities’ goal is to adopt the euro
in early 2007. There is broad consensus of all political parties and social partners on this
objective.
2.
Slovenia is well poised to adopt the euro, but risks and challenges remain. Real
convergence in terms of per capita income and productivity is comparable to that of some
non-core euro countries. Slovenia already meets the Maastricht criteria for long-term interest
rates and the fiscal deficit and debt

consumer prices. Though recent
developments in real wages relative to productivity growth have been favorable, wage-setting
mechanisms are not sufficiently flexible. Also, current conditions call for a tighter fiscal
policy stance and a lowering of expenditure rigidities.
3.
Economic performance in 2004 was strong,
and policy implementation was generally in line
with the Fund’s advice (Box 1). Real GDP growth
accelerated sharply to 4½ percent, driven by a positive
swing in the contribution of net foreign demand.
Exports to the main EU and non-EU destinations rose
in response to stronger import demand in these
countries. However, with the terms of trade
deteriorating owing to higher oil and commodity
prices, the external current account deficit widened to
almost 1 percent of GDP (Figure 1 and Table 1).

Box 1. Policy Recommendations and Implementation
In concluding the last Article IV consultation, Executive Directors focused on policies to ensure a
smooth transition to ERM2 entry and euro adoption as well as strong performance in the monetary union
(http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/cat/longres.cfm?sk=17421.0 ).
Over the years, the authorities have generally heeded the Fund’s policy advice, except with regard to
monetary policy. The BoS pursued a more gradual approach to tackling inflation than advocated by the
staff. Nevertheless, recent progress in disinflation was better than expected.
In 2004, the implementation of monetary policy was cautious. In line with the Fund’s advice, the BoS
did not lead the market in lowering nominal interest rates prior to ERM2 entry. Under ERM2, it has
given primacy to exchange rate stability.
On the fiscal front, despite the elections, the authorities implemented expenditure saving measures to
contain the deficit within the budgeted level. However, there was little progress in laying the ground for
expenditure rationalization that would ensure achievement of structural balance in the medium term.
The authorities took steps to strengthen banking supervision and implement the recommendations of the
2004 Financial System Stability Assessment (FSSA) update.

Domestic demand growth did not take off as feared by the staff, but maintained
momentum. Consumption and investment contributed about equally to GDP growth.

declined from 4.6 percent in December 2003 to 3.2 percent in December 2004 and fell
further to 2.1 percent in May 2005. Supply side and structural factors were important driving
forces behind this trend: an improved harvest, the elimination of remaining duties on imports
from the EU, and increased competition in the retail market resulted in falling food prices
and moderate increases in the prices of non-food items (Figures 2 and 3). Wage
developments also played a positive role, as the pace of real wage increases in both the
tradable and non-tradable sectors lagged behind productivity growth by a wider margin than
in 2003 (Figure 4). Disinflation was additionally reinforced by the stabilization of the
exchange rate after ERM2 entry.

The monetary framework changed following ERM2 entry, and monetary
conditions became tighter. Until June 2004, the BoS continued with its policy of lowering
interest rates gradually in response to the deceleration in inflation, while depreciating the
exchange rate at a steadily slowing pace to avoid widening the uncovered interest parity.
Upon ERM2 entry, the BoS ended its depreciation policy, and set the central parity at SIT
239.64 per euro, close to the then-prevailing market rate. Since then, the market rate has not
deviated from central parity by more than ±0.20 percent, and the BoS has kept its key policy
interest rate (on 60-day bills) unchanged at 4 percent (Figure 5).
7.
However, with further
convergence of tolar lending
rates and increased
competition in the banking
sector, bank credit accelerated
in 2004. The pick-up in credit
growth was particularly strong
for individuals, but the bulk of
the credit continued to be
absorbed by enterprises. While
most of the new loans to
individuals were tolar
denominated, about four-fifths
of new lending to enterprises
was euro denominated (Figure
6). With slow growth in deposits

on account of lower interest rates and increased alternative saving opportunities, banks
increasingly resorted to foreign financing from parent banks and through syndicated loans to
fund their lending activities (Table 2). For both enterprises and individuals, interest rates on
new tolar-denominated loans declined in nominal and real terms, while nominal rates on new
euro-denominated loans were broadly stable. Aggressive pricing by foreign-owned banks to
increase market share has resulted in lower interest rates on euro-denominated loans than
abroad, while rates on tolar-denominated consumer loans are comparable to those in the euro
area (Figure 7).
8.
The general government deficit was slightly lower than envisaged in the budget,
but the expenditure structure became more rigid. The temporary decrease in VAT
receipts due to the elimination of border customs control upon EU accession was higher than
anticipated. However, the shortfall was offset

Competitiveness remains satisfactory. The unit labor cost (ULC)-based real
effective exchange rate (REER) and the relative profitability index have remained broadly
unchanged since early 1998. The CPI-based REER has been relatively flat since mid-2003,
consistent with the conclusion of recent IMF staff studies that the tolar appeared to be in line
with its fundamentals1 (Figures 8 and 9). In recent periods, Slovene exporters have increased
their presence in both EU and non-EU countries, and many have promoted market
penetration through establishing affiliates abroad. However, the increase in EU market share
has been smaller for Slovenia than for the neighboring new EU-member states (NMS),
although Slovenia’s bilateral real exchange rate vis-à-vis these countries has depreciated

(Figure 10).2 The better export performance of the neighboring NMS is likely a reflection of
higher inflows of foreign direct investment and the associated preferential market linkages.
10.
The build-up of external debt represents a potential vulnerability. With the
increased external financing by banks, total external debt rose rapidly in the past two years to
about 60 percent of GDP at end-2004. However, the net debt position was small, at below
10 percent of GDP. Short-term debt (on residual maturity basis) remained less than gross
official reserves, though the debt ratio increased. The external debt service ratio was broadly
unchanged (Table 4).
II. REPORT ON THE DISCUSSIONS
11.
The discussions centered on policy priorities for achieving smoothly the
authorities’ goal of early euro adoption and for strong performance in the monetary
union. The authorities were narrowly focused on the immediate main challenges: to
implement policies that will lower average inflation to a rate that meets the Maastricht
inflation criterion and to maintain exchange rate stability within the “normal fluctuation
margins” of ERM2. They believed that continuation of current monetary conditions, restraint
in administered price adjustments, wage moderation, and a neutral fiscal stance would enable
achievement of the euro adoption goal. The staff thought that fiscal policy should adopt a
more restrictive stance to reduce the risks to the disinflation objective. The authorities were
less concerned than the staff about the risks, but would consider corrective policy measures
as necessary. The staff noted that maintaining low inflation and competitiveness after euro
adoption and addressing the budgetary implications of an ageing population would be
continuing challenges, and advised faster progress in achieving the official medium-term
goal of structural fiscal balance and in enhancing wage and fiscal policy flexibility.
A. Macroeconomic Outlook
12.
There was consensus that economic growth would likely moderate to around
4 percent in 2005-06—an expansion still above estimates of potential and implying a
further narrowing of the output gap. Domestic demand growth is expected to ease, owing
to a further slowdown of inventory accumulation and the dampening effect of lower tax relief
on investment that will come into force in 2006 (Table 5). While not ruling it out completely,
the authorities perceived the risk of a pick-up in private consumption growth to be small.
They pointed to various explanations why a domestic demand boom had not materialized in
Slovenia and may be absent in the period ahead (Box 2). The staff agreed that the factors
stimulating household saving in non-bank financial institutions and outflows of investible
resources were likely to persist and that, with convergence of nominal lending rates virtually
complete, bank credit growth should stabilize. However, in the event of a further acceleration

Eurostat data shows that while Slovenia’s ULC in euros is higher than that of most NMS,
its relative ULC vis-à-vis this group has declined by about 18 percent since 1995.

Slovenia experienced rapid private credit growth in 2004, fueled by interest rate convergence
and heightened competition in the banking sector. This was not accompanied by a
commensurate pick-up in domestic demand, though private consumption and credit growth to
households seemingly rose hand in hand. While there is a strong positive correlation between
private consumption and credit growth (0.74 during 2000–04), the importance of credit growth
diminishes once developments in personal income are taken into account.
The authorities highlighted several features of the Slovene economy that may explain the weak
relationship between credit and demand growth.
•

Slovenia’s per capita income is already about 70 percent of the EU-15 average and
comparable to that of some non-core euro countries. Hence, the “catch-up” effect is
small. Moreover, in recent years, income distribution has shifted in favor of higher-paid
workers, who tend to have a higher saving propensity.

•

House ownership is very high in Slovenia, implying limited potential demand for
housing loans. Indeed, the share of housing loans in new loans to households has
declined from about one half in 2002 to one third in 2004. In addition, home equity
loans are not available.

•

Structural changes in the financial sector have had a positive influence on household
saving behavior. Participation in the voluntary pension insurance scheme has increased
steadily since its introduction in 2000. Also, investment in mutual funds has grown
progressively since 2002, coinciding with the harmonization of domestic legislation
with that of the EU and supported by sustained high returns. In turn, insurance
companies and mutual funds have invested an increasing proportion of their resources
in foreign securities.

•

To some extent, domestic credit growth to enterprises reflects substitution of direct
foreign borrowing by the corporate sector. Also, it is likely that part of the bank credit
has been to support investment abroad by Slovene firms.

Looking ahead, the authorities expect that, with interest rate convergence virtually complete,
credit growth will stabilize. In their view, household saving in non-bank financial institutions
and outflows of investible resources are likely to remain strong. With less than one third of the
active working population currently covered by voluntary supplementary pension insurance,
participation in the scheme should continue to increase. Entry by foreign mutual funds (that
began in September 2004) ought to increase competition and broaden the domestic mutual
funds market. Although mutual fund returns are expected to fall, they are likely to remain
higher than bank deposit rates. Because of the low market capitalization of the Slovene
securities market, mutual funds are likely to increase investment in foreign securities. To
remain competitive in the global market, Slovene enterprises, especially those in the laborintensive industries, are likely to place increasing emphasis on relocating some of their
activities abroad through foreign investment.

- 11 -

in credit growth, the authorities would need to give consideration to appropriate offsetting
policy response, particularly on the fiscal front.
13.

The stimulus to growth from net foreign demand is expected to be small in the
foreseeable future. Export growth is likely to ease in 2005 and remain over the medium
term in line with the projected import demand in Slovenia’s main trading partners. Gains in
export market shares, especially in non-EU countries, are liable to diminish over time as it is
anticipated that Slovene firms will increasingly invest abroad in production facilities for
efficiency reasons rather than for trade promotion. The rising trend in import content of
domestic demand is likely to continue. With higher oil prices contributing to a further
deterioration in the terms of trade, the external current account deficit is projected to widen to
1½ percent of GDP in 2005. However, on the expectation that oil prices will drop
subsequently to the present futures market levels, the current deficit is projected to fall in
2006 and stabilize at about ½ percent of GDP over the medium term (Tables 6 and 7).
External debt sustainability is not an imminent concern. On the assumption that
external borrowing by banks will continue at a slower pace and that foreign direct investment
inflows will pick up upon euro adoption, the external debt-to-GDP ratio is projected to
increase gradually to around 67 percent of GDP in 2009. The baseline scenario is relatively
resilient to nominal interest rate and real growth shocks, but would worsen significantly in
the event of a sizable depreciation of the currency. However, the likelihood of this last
scenario would seem small as Slovenia is more likely to face appreciation pressure in the
run-up to euro adoption (Appendix III).

Barring major shocks and with supportive policies, the authorities expected
inflation to stabilize around 2½ percent during the assessment period (June 2005–
May 2006) for the Maastricht criteria. The projected inflation rate, which the staff
considered feasible, is within the estimated reference rate based on the World Economic
Outlook projections of inflation in the comparators (2.9 percent) but higher than the rate
based on the current inflation outturn in these countries (2.2 percent). The authorities

- 12 -

highlighted the uncertainty about the reference rate for the Maastricht inflation criterion, and
agreed on the need to remain vigilant about inflationary pressures. However, they were more
concerned about the upside risk to the inflation outlook from oil price rises than from fasterthan-potential economic growth or increases in producer prices. They noted that the effects of
the narrowing output gap had been muted to date and took the view that any increase in
domestic demand pressures would largely spill over into a higher external current account
deficit. The authorities also argued that increased competition was suppressing the passthrough of higher producer prices to consumer prices. Further, the increase in producer prices
in 2004 reflected mainly a catching-up with the price level in the EU and the pace had
slowed in recent months.
16.

If the achievement of the Maastricht inflation criterion were at risk, the
authorities would take appropriate corrective measures, including active use of incomes
and exchange rate policies. The actual choice of policy instruments would depend on an
assessment of their effectiveness, taking into account the stage in the assessment period in
which an upturn in inflation materialized.
B. Monetary and Exchange Rate Policy

17.
Under ERM2, the BoS intends to operate within a undisclosed narrow exchange
rate band around the central parity and let domestic interest rates be determined by
interest rates in the euro area and the country risk premium. Despite a 2-percentage
point differential between the BoS’s policy rate and the European Central Bank (ECB)
refinancing rate since ERM2 entry, there had been no pressure in the foreign exchange
market from capital inflows and, therefore, no need for exchange rate intervention. BoS
officials noted that, besides a clearly defined monetary policy framework, enhanced policy
coordination between the BoS and the government, the small size of the fiscal deficit, and a
relatively thin government securities market helped avoid exchange rate volatility.
18.
Given the need to guard against the upward risks to inflation, the staff welcomed
the BoS’s intention to keep the policy interest rate unchanged for as long as market
conditions permit. The BoS intends to equalize its policy rate with the ECB refinancing rate
at the start of the euro pre-entry period 3 (provisionally autumn 2006, assuming euro adoption
in January 2007) when the conversion rate of the tolar also would be irrevocably fixed. At
that time, with the reduction of the exchange rate risk, the BoS also plans to discontinue the
current contractual agreement with banks on exchange rate policy operations and the use of
foreign exchange swaps.4 The BoS has prepared a detailed blueprint for adjusting its policy
instruments to those of the Eurosystem in the period leading up to the adoption of the euro.

Report for the 2004 Article IV Consultation (IMF Country Report No. 04/150).

- 13 -

19.
BoS officials indicated that, should there be signs before end-2005 of inflation
exceeding the projected path, they would consider tightening monetary conditions by
using a combination of instruments and utilizing the flexibility provided under the
ERM2 framework. The staff agreed that initiating monetary tightening after end-2005 might
not be practicable. Given the 3 to 4 quarters transmission lags, a sizable tightening would be
needed to have a discernible impact on inflation during the assessment period and could
adversely affect competitiveness and growth.
C. Price and Wage Policies
20.
The authorities’ disinflation strategy will continue to entail limiting increases in
administered and regulated prices to no more than the projected inflation rate. The
authorities consider this policy

fuels counter-cyclically to cushion the fluctuations in international oil prices and their impact
on inflationary expectations, but trend increases will be fully passed on to consumers, as in
2004.5
21.
The prospects for continued wage moderation in 2005 are good. The government
recently concluded an agreement with trade unions that provides for a further decline in
average real public sector wages. The Social Agreement for 2003–05 would remain the basis
for wage settlements in the private sector. Thus, the authorities expected that the increase in
real wages would lag behind productivity growth by at least 1 percentage point. Noting that a
stable relative profitability index was associated with declining product unit labor costs in
Slovenia as well as in partner countries (see Figures 8 and 9), the staff agreed that the policy
of wage increases lagging productivity growth should continue for maintaining
competitiveness.

5

The domestic prices of oil derivatives, excluding excise taxes and dealer margin, are
automatically adjusted every 14 days in line with world market price developments. The EU
directive on minimum excise taxes puts a lower bound on the tax adjustment policy.

- 14 -

22.
However, risks remain from wage negotiations for 2006 and beyond. Negotiations
initiated in 2003 on a new public sector wage structure aimed at reducing wage dispersion
have not yet been concluded.6 The authorities intend to implement the new wage structure
over a four-year period and finance it from funds set aside from the budgetary allocations for
wage bill indexation. However, trade union representatives saw a need for additional
resources. They cautioned that their position on wage bargaining would harden if
concessions were sought on important non-wage issues during the negotiations on a new
Social Agreement (see ¶33). The staff noted that greater wage and price flexibility was
paramount for absorbing asymmetric shocks once in the monetary union, and encouraged
social partners to eliminate wage indexation and use the scope for greater productivity-based
differentiation of wages. For example, in contrast to the overall trend, the wage-productivity
growth gap in the trade and hotel sectors had narrowed in 2004, as real wage increases in
these two sectors had been allowed to lag sector-specific productivity growth by less than the
one percentage point prescribed by the economy-wide guideline of the current Social
Agreement. In this context, the staff noted that applying sector-specific productivity
increases as the basis for wage increases in individual sectors would, inter alia, reduce
supply-side inflation pressures.
23.
The authorities’ agreed with the staff’s view that the broadly shared objective of
meeting the Maastricht inflation criterion might warrant a wage pact at the national
and enterprise levels. However, they noted that to have a dampening effect on inflation
during the assessment period, the measure would need to be in place before end-2005, and
indicated that its need would be assessed in the fourth quarter. Unlike during the 2004
consultation discussions, when a center-left government was in power, trade union
representatives were hesitant to sign off unconditionally on this option. Senior government
officials noted that efforts to strengthen relations with trade unions were ongoing.
D. Fiscal Policy
24.
The revised 2005 budget envisages a broadly neutral fiscal stance and involves a
further tilt in resource allocation toward current expenditure. The authorities agreed that
a tighter fiscal stance was desirable in principle, to be supportive of disinflation and because
the current economic conditions were propitious for initiating adjustment toward the official
medium-term objective of structural balance. However, they highlighted several constraining
factors: a large carryover from 2004 on the wage bill; underestimation of wages in the
education sector in the original 2005 budget; additional staffing needs in judicial bodies and
for border policing and defense (in line with EU and NATO requirements); and unanticipated
needs such as higher maintenance expenditure on railway infrastructure and court-mandated
6

The aim is to lower dispersion gradually from 1:12.3 to 1:10, which the staff does not
consider a problem given the higher wages in public administration relative to the private
sector. Over the past several years, the current wage-setting mechanism had increased wage
dispersion by granting larger wage increases for the higher-paid workers.

Achieving political consensus on

some of the measures was likely to be time consuming. The specific measures would be
elaborated during the preparation of the two-year budget for 2006–07. Even on the
assumption of continued wage restraint in the public sector and no increase in real
expenditure on goods and services and most social transfers, the staff estimate that the
overall and structural fiscal deficits would worsen slightly in 2006–07. Accordingly, the staff
encouraged the authorities to make an early decisive start in restraining nondiscretionary
budgetary expenditure.
26.
In 2006, the authorities intend to revert from the existing system of indexing
pensions to wages with a lag to the earlier practice of indexing them to current wage
growth. The staff expressed concern that the proposed change would have a serious negative
effect on the long-term soundness of the pension system and public finances in general, as it
would result in additional annual pension obligations of about 1 percent of GDP within seven
years. Population ageing already poses significant budgetary challenges. Even with the
pension reform undertaken in 2000, pension payments are projected to increase from
13 percent of GDP in 2005 to 18 percent of GDP in 2020. The staff recommended that the
issue of pension indexation be handled within the framework of a comprehensive reform
package that preserved the long-run sustainability of the pension system, and that
consideration be given to linking pensions to inflation instead of wage growth. While senior
policymakers saw merit in these arguments, they considered the widening gap between
pensions and wages to be politically untenable.
27.
The authorities are considering a further reduction of payroll taxes to enhance
competitiveness and intend to link the measure to the new Social Agreement for 2006
and beyond. However, in light of the confirmation by representatives of the business
community that past payroll tax reductions were used for wage increases, the staff advised
against lowering payroll taxes unless a new wage setting mechanism was designed to prevent
the extra resources from being used for wage increases.
28.
Public debt sustainability is not a major concern. At end–2004, general
government debt stood at 29½ percent of GDP—well below the Maastricht limit. Most debt
is long-term and the repayment profile is spread evenly over time. Assuming that the
structural fiscal deficit remains unchanged, the debt ratio is projected to decline to 27 percent
in 2009 (Appendix IV). Vulnerability of government debt to changes in inflation, interest
rates, and the exchange rate is low. Since 2002, the government has increasingly issued
securities at fixed rates and shifted to borrowing in the domestic market. Currently, fixed-rate
debt represents about 60 percent of general government debt, and the proportion of indexlinked debt has decreased to about 14 percent of total debt.
E. Banking Sector Issues
29.
Financial soundness indicators show that the Slovene banking system is healthy,
though some potential vulnerabilities merit monitoring. Banks are adequately capitalized
and profitable, and asset quality remains high. Competition and interest rate convergence
have resulted in shrinking interest margins and lower net interest income (Table 9). Since
interest margins in euro-denominated activities are lower than in tolar-denominated

- 17 -

activities, banks are vulnerable to further margin compression in the transition to euro
adoption. Banks have redressed the reduction in interest income mainly by improving cost
efficiency and increasing non-interest revenues. There is no evidence to date of deteriorating
credit quality. BoS officials noted that banking regulations with respect to risk classification
and provisioning (based on longOpen Foreign Exchange Position of Corporate Sector, 2000–03 1/

compared to liabilities. The BoS was planning to prepare regulations on interest risk
reporting and to perform additional on-site inspections on interest risk exposure. In meetings
with the staff, banks downplayed the BoS’s concern, noting that they typically covered
interest rate exposure through swaps.
30.
The International Financial Reporting System (IFRS) will be applied to banks
from January 2006. The authorities indicated that this would require some reorganization of
provisioning triggers and rates,7 and would likely lower the provisioning requirements for
outstanding and new claims. With a view to avoiding additional credit expansion, the
authorities have decided, in consultation with the banks and auditors, to classify outstanding
provisions released as a component of statutory reserves.
31.
Foreign currency exposure of the corporate sector represents a source of
increasing, albeit still small, credit risk for banks. The bulk of the short open foreign
exchange position of the corporate sector, which has been rising since 2000, is with entities
other than domestic banks. The rising trend in banks’ own open foreign exchange position
reversed slightly in 2004 (see Table 9). Banks emphasized that they strictly adhered to
prudential guidelines on direct foreign exchange exposure and offered hedging instruments to
their clients. They saw the increasing euroization of their balance sheets as a natural
concomitant of integration with the EU financial system, and argued that the increase in
euro-denominated loans reflected the high probability attached by borrowers to early euro
adoption. The share of domestic euro-denominated deposits (about one third in 2004) was
also rising, though at a slower pace owing to higher interest rates on tolar deposits and
expectation of exchange rate stability.
7

For example, unlike the IFRS, current Slovene regulations do not allow provisioning
requirements to be lowered for loans secured by mortgages.

- 18 -

32.
The transfer of credit risk on household loans from banks to insurance
companies is a potential vulnerability for the financial sector. About one half of
household loans are secured by insurance companies. In the past few years, insurers have
recorded a very high ratio of claims paid out to collected premiums on credit insurance
(averaging about 90 percent compared to 64 percent for all insurance classes combined). The
staff encouraged the authorities to enhance supervision of insurance companies and, as
recommended in the 2004 FSSA update, to ensure that insurers develop the capacity to set
pricing, provisioning, and capital at appropriate levels.
F. Other Structural Issues
33.
Further privatization and attracting foreign direct investment are continuing
challenges. The authorities have initiated an audit of the government’s ownership in
enterprises and, in light of the improved market environment, are preparing strategies to
privatize the dominant telecommunications provider and steel mills. They also plan to list the
NKBM (the second largest bank) on the stock exchange, with a view to its privatization.
According to representatives of the business community, although Slovenia had introduced
laws aimed at improving the business climate and had harmonized its legislation with that of
the EU, potential investors still found administrative procedures at the local government level
cumbersome and were discouraged by the limited availability of developed industrial sites
and high labor costs. However, the authorities believed that a highly educated and skilled
labor force made Slovenia an attractive destination for investors interested in creating a niche
in specialized markets. They noted that interest of potential investors in automotive,
chemicals, and distribution sectors was steadily growing.
34.
Consideration is being given to improving labor market flexibility. Slovenia’s
employment protection legislation is more restrictive than that of neighboring new EUmember states. The employment rigidity index is also above the regional and EU-15 average.

Trade union representatives argued that liberal regulations on fixed-term employment gave
sufficient flexibility to employers: the bulk of new hiring by enterprises was fixed-term and
inflows into the unemployment pool were mainly persons whose fixed-term contract had

by adequate resources for retraining laid-off workers and finding them jobs. The staff
stressed the importance of staying within the overall budget envelope in implementing any
program on this front.
35.
Upon EU accession, Slovenia has transferred the competence of trade policy to
the EU authorities. It has terminated all bilateral preferential trade agreements and adopted
the EU’s common customs tariff and preferential agreements.8 The authorities considered the
negative impact of the termination of the bilateral preferential agreements on exports to be
small compared with the benefits of joining the EU. They indicated that the recent
elimination of WTO quotas on textiles was likely to aggravate the already poor financial
situation in this sector, which accounts for almost one tenth of exports and 5 percent of
employment.
III. STAFF APPRAISAL
36.
With EU accession and ERM2 entry accomplished, policy makers are now
focused on securing a smooth transition to euro adoption in early 2007. The authorities’
goal appears feasible, though risks remain. The levels of fiscal deficit, public debt, and longterm interest rate already meet the Maastricht criteria. Exchange rate variability under ERM2
has been limited, and competitiveness appears adequate. However, the inflation rate, though
falling, remains above the Maastricht criterion. Progress toward achieving this criterion could
be undermined by potential upside risks to inflation—arising from higher oil prices, fasterthan-potential economic growth, and large producer price increases—thereby putting added
pressure on disinflation policies. Besides the short-term challenges to meeting the formal
requirements of euro adoption, the authorities also face the task of ensuring strong
performance in the monetary union. Thus far, the authorities’ policy strategy has been driven
mainly by the short-term goals of meeting the Maastricht criteria and a minimum stay in
ERM2. More attention will need to be placed on enhancing the flexibility of fiscal and wage
policies to absorb shocks in the absence of monetary policy and to maintain low inflation and
competitiveness.
37.
The BoS should guard against upside risks to inflation. Thus, the BoS’s intention
to keep policy interest rates unchanged until forced otherwise by market conditions is
appropriate. At the first signs of inflation beginning to exceed the targeted path, a tightening
of monetary conditions would be in order. It is understood, however, that because of
transmission lags the scope for monetary tightening will become smaller with the approach
of the end of the assessment period.

8

Upon EU accession, the simple average tariff for industrial goods has declined from
7.68 percent to 4.5 percent, while that for agricultural products has increased from
12.6 percent to 17.3 percent.

- 20 -

38.
Fiscal policy should support disinflation and aim at increasing flexibility in the
public finances. A tighter stance than that envisaged by the revised 2005 budget would help
reduce the risks to the disinflation objective and put public finances on the consolidation path
toward the official medium-term goal of structural balance. Further fiscal consolidation
would create a safety margin against breaching the SGP’s deficit threshold in case of adverse
cyclical conditions. In the event of revenue overperformance, it will therefore be important to
save the additional revenue and ensure an improved fiscal outturn. Determined efforts are
needed to contain nondiscretionary budget expenditure and reduce its rigidities. The efforts
should be initiated at an early stage and focus on slower increases in public sector
employment, restrictions on non-selective promotions, and reform of social entitlements and
health care. Given the budgetary challenges of an ageing population, any change in the
pension indexation mechanism that results in higher pension payments should be avoided.
Linking pensions with inflation instead of wage growth would improve the long-term
soundness of the pension system. Also, further lowering of payroll taxes should not be
considered unless mechanisms are in place to safeguard the extra resources from being used
for wage increases.
39.
Greater wage flexibility is most critical for adjusting to asymmetric shocks once
in the euro area, securing sustained low inflation, and safeguarding competitiveness.
The recent favorable developments in real wages relative to productivity growth should be
sustained. In the Social Agreement for 2006 and beyond, both the government and social
partners are encouraged to eliminate wage indexation and move to a wage-setting system that
ensures greater productivity-based wage differentiation. In the public sector, it will be
important to restrict the cost of the new wage structure within the overall budget constraint
consistent with the government’s medium-term fiscal goals. If achievement of the Maastricht
inflation criterion appears to be under threat, a wage pact at the national and enterprise levels
should be considered on an emergency basis.
40.
Maintaining strong supervisory oversight of financial institutions will be critical
to guard against risk of stresses on the financial sector. The BoS’s intention to classify
outstanding provisions released on account of adopting the IFRS as a component of statutory
reserves is appropriate. The exposure of banks to credit and interest rate risks will require
close monitoring and active management. Banks are particularly vulnerable to further
compression of interest margins in the transition to euro adoption. The authorities are
encouraged to enhance the supervision of insurance companies and implement the
recommendations of the FSSA update for this sector.
41.
Progress in structural reforms in other areas should be maintained. The staff
welcomes the consideration being given to further privatization, attracting foreign direct
investment, and improving labor market flexibility.
42.
It is recommended that the Article IV consultation with Slovenia remain on the
standard 12-month cycle.

1/ Revenues and deficit figures have been adjusted for the shift of budget accounting to a pure cash basis. Without the adjustment, the general government
deficit would have reached SIT 156 bn, or 3 percent of GDP, as the unadjusted figures contained only 11 months of VAT and excise tax.
2/ On the basis of the macro framework presented by the authorities when the budget was adopted.
3/ In 2005, foreign debt falling due was replaced by domestic debt.

Exchange Rate Arrangement

The currency of Slovenia is the tolar (SIT). On June 28, 2004, Slovenia joined the ERM2 at
the central parity of SIT239.64 per euro and the authorities stated that they would aim for
stability of the exchange within a narrow, but unannounced band. Since ERM2 entry, the
exchange rate has remained close to the central parity. Slovenia aims to adopt the euro in
January 2007.

SLOVENIA: STATISTICAL ISSUES
43.
Special Data Dissemination Standard: Slovenia has subscribed to the Special Data
Dissemination Standard (SDDS), meets the SDDS specifications, and its metadata are posted
on the Fund’s Dissemination Standards Bulletin Board on the Internet.
http://dsbb.imf.org/Applications/web/sddscountrycategorylist/?strcode=SVN
44.
Real Sector Statistics: The Statistical Office of the Republic of Slovenia (SORS)
follows the 1993 System of National Accounts (SNA 93) and the European System of
Accounts 1995 (ESA95). Quarterly GDP estimates by industry and expenditure categories
are compiled in both current and constant 2000 prices, and are published within 80 days after
the reference quarter.
45.
The indices of consumer and producer prices are compiled in accordance with
international standards. The SORS also compiles a retail price index (RPI), which differs
from the consumer price index in weights only.
46.
Government Finance Statistics: Slovenian fiscal data are timely and of a high
quality. The ministry of finance publishes a comprehensive monthly Bulletin of Government
Finance, which presents monthly data on the operations of the “state budget” (Budgetary
Central Government), local governments, social security (Pension and Health funds), and the
consolidated general government. The coverage of general government excludes the
operations of extrabudgetary funds and own revenues of general government agencies
(zavods). However, these operations are small in size. Monthly and annual fiscal data are
reported for publication in International Financial Statistics (IFS) and the Government
Finance Statistics Yearbook (GFSY), respectively, on a timely basis.
47.

Money and Banking Statistics: Monetary statistics are timely and of good quality.

48.
Balance of Payments Statistics: Balance of payments data are comprehensive and of
high quality. The data have been published in the Balance of Payments Statistics Yearbook
since 1993 (with estimates of the international investment position published since 1994). In
2002, the Bank of Slovenia revised the balance of payments statistics going back to 1994; the
most significant revisions were related to the income component of the current account and
to the other investment component of the financial account.
7.
External Debt Statistics: External debt statistics were revised and brought in line
with the SDDS in August 2003. The main change comprised of inclusion of trade credits in
the debt data .

APPENDIX III

SLOVENIA: EXTERNAL DEBT SUSTAINABILITY ANALYSIS
49.
Slovenia’s external outlook does not raise major concerns regarding external
sustainability. Under the baseline scenario, the external debt-to-GDP ratio, which jumped by
5 percentage points in 2004 to 59 percent, will continue to grow at a slowing pace and
stabilize at 67 percent of GDP from 2008. With the external current account deficit projected
to average ½ percent of GDP during 2006-09, the increase in the external debt ratio mainly
reflects a balance sheet restructuring by banks. With households increasingly saving in nonbank financial institutions, banks have resorted to foreign borrowing to fund their lending
activities. It is expected that this tendency will slow down and stabilize over the medium
term. Although the bulk of new borrowing is euro-denominated, the exchange risk is not a
big concern given the experience so far under the ERM2, and would disappear with euro
adoption planned for January 2007. Slovenia does not face any rollover risks on its external
debt.
50.
Stress tests suggest that the baseline scenario is sensitive to shocks, particularly a
sizable depreciation of the currency. A hypothetical 30-percent decline in the tolar
exchange rate against the euro in 2005 would result in a 29.3-percentage point jump in the
debt-to-GDP ratio to 88.7 percent. The ratio would continue to grow at a declining rate,
reaching 98.3 percent by 2009. However, in the run-up to euro adoption Slovenia is more
likely to face an upward pressure on its currency, thus limiting the likelihood of this scenario.
The baseline scenario would worsen significantly in the case of a two-standard deviation
shock to the GDP deflator or a combination of one-standard deviation to the former and to
real GDP, the nominal interest rate, and the non-interest current account. In both situations,
the external debt-to-GDP ratio would jump in 2005-06 (by 7-9 percentage points of GDP in
each year, more than three times higher than the increase in the baseline scenario). The
growth in the ratio would taper off during subsequent years, reaching 79 percent in 2009 in
the case of a GDP deflator shock and stabilizing around 76½ percent from 2008 in the case of
a combination of shocks. Two-standard deviation shocks to real GDP, nominal interest rates,
or the non-interest current account balance separately would lead to important, but less acute
deviations from the baseline scenario. In any of these scenarios, Slovenia should be able to
roll over its debt, thus sustainability problems appear limited.

APPENDIX IV

SLOVENIA: PUBLIC DEBT SUSTAINABILITY ANALYSIS
51.
Slovenia’s general government debt was less than 30 percent of GDP at end2004, which is low compared to other EU-member states and well below the Maastricht
criterion threshold. The debt-to-GDP ratio increased from 18½ percent at end-1994 to
29½ percent at end-2004 in spite of fiscal surpluses in the first part of the 1990s and of
moderate deficits from 1997 onward. The increase was driven mainly by debt assumed as a
result of bank and enterprise restructuring and by the inheritance of liabilities from the
former Federal Republic of Yugoslavia.9 In addition, until 2000 the central government
borrowed mainly through inflation-linked (and to a lesser extent exchange-rate linked)
instruments, which also contributed to a rising debt level in spite of a strong fiscal position.
52.
The baseline scenario shows a gradual decline in the general government debtto-GDP ratio to around 27 percent in 2009. In this scenario, it is assumed that the
structural fiscal deficit remains unchanged at the 2005 level (i.e., 1.1 percent of GDP). The
decline in the debt ratio would be larger if the government brought down the structural deficit
progressively toward balance as envisaged in the Convergence Program. In 2000, the
government started a gradual transition towards the use of long-term fixed-rate financing
instruments. The first ten-year tolar-denominated Treasury bonds were issued in 2003. As a
result of this debt management policy, the share of indexed debt is expected to steadily
decline over the medium term. This explains why, unlike in the past, a prudent medium-term
budgetary policy and the absence of debt assumption are expected to translate into a
declining debt ratio.
53.
The baseline is relatively resilient to shocks and sustainability is not a problem.
The standard stress tests show that Slovenia’s public debt position seems relatively resilient
to real interest rate and exchange rate shocks. A two-standard deviations shock to the real
interest rate in 2005 and 2006 implies a 29.6 percent debt-to-GDP ratio in 2009 (compared to
27.3 percent in the baseline scenario). Even in the case of a 30 percent real depreciation in
2005 (a scenario which could only materialize in the event of an unlikely speculative attack
on the tolar prior to euro adoption), the debt-to-GDP ratio would still be contained at
31½ percent in 2009. The highest risk is posed by a 10 percent increase in other debt-creating
flows in 2005. Even in this case, however, the debt-to-GDP ratio would be around
36½ percent in 2009.

9

Debt assumption reached a peak in 1995, when it represented 45 percent of end-of-year
outstanding debt.

Statement by Johann Prader, Alternate Executive Director for Republic of Slovenia
and Ksenjia Maver, Advisor to Executive Director
July 20, 2005

The Slovene authorities wish to thank the IMF mission for its constructive contribution to the
economic policy discussion. The Article IV consultation resulted in a broad agreement
between the authorities and the IMF team on the major policy issues and the challenges
ahead.
This Buff provides an update of the developments since the March 2005 Article IV
consultation, in particular of recent steps undertaken by the authorities to smoothen the
transition to the euro.
Economic activity and balance of payments
Economic growth is projected to stay close to 4 percent in 2005 and 2006, down from
4.6 percent in 2004. The year-on-year rate of growth slowed from 4.3 percent in the fourth
quarter of last year to 2.6 percent in the first quarter of this year, largely reflecting a sharp
decline in gross capital formation. Other domestic demand components are in line with the
projections. In the first quarter of 2005 seasonally adjusted GDP increased by 0.9 percent.
As a result of a better performance of the trade balance, the current account recorded a slight
surplus in the first five months of 2005. Exports in this period were 12 percent higher than
one year ago. Imports increased less than exports. The contribution of the foreign component
to the first quarter economic growth was positive (1.3 percentage points). Nevertheless, the
Bank of Slovenia expects a widening of the current account deficit from 0.9 percent of GDP
in 2004 to 1.6 percent of GDP by the end of this year. The expected weakening of foreign
demand, the deterioration in the terms of trade as well as the decline in net capital income are
the most important causes of this worsening.
Inflation
In 2005, inflation has continued its downward path. Annual inflation was brought down from
3.2 percent in December 2004 to 1.9 percent in June 2005. The favorable disinflation reflects,
in no small measure, sound and coordinated macroeconomic policies. Lower food prices,
helped by the changes in the trade regime following the EU entry, also made an important
contribution. The Bank of Slovenia’s April 2005 Monetary Policy Report projects
stabilization of inflation at 2.4 percent by the final quarter of this year, and at 2.6 percent by
the final quarter of next year. The envisaged gradual increase in inflation should be seen
against the backdrop of strong disinflation recorded in the second half of 2004 after the EU
entry in May 2004. The risks to the inflation projection stem mainly from further increases in
oil prices. The inflationary pressures from increased domestic demand are moderate. Still,
support from fiscal policy and the social partners will be essential for continuing the
downward trend in inflation.

-2Fiscal policy
In June 2005, the Parliament approved the revised budget for 2005 which envisages a deficit
of 1.4 percent of GDP, compared with a deficit of 1.7 percent of GDP projected in the initial
budget adopted in December 2003. There is a clear commitment to sustain the path of fiscal
consolidation in line with the medium term fiscal objective, which will support the euro
adoption process by contributing to a sustainable decline in inflation. Preparations for the
two-year 2006/2007 budget have already started.
The Government is working on changes in two areas. In the health system, the changes are
aimed at streamlining the basic benefit package and at increasing some benefits for the lower
income population. In the pension system, the changes include an adjustment of the pension
indexation formula in order to make the pension increases consistent with the wage growth.
The recent analysis prepared by the Institute of Macroeconomic Analysis and Development
(IMAD) on the challenges ahead, especially those related to euro adoption, underlines the
positive contribution of fiscal policy to macroeconomic stabilization, and calls for increased
flexibility on the expenditure side, especially in the face of the high share of nondiscretionary spending related to wages and social transfers. This would be important in
order to release fiscal resources for investment and co-financing of EU funds.
Monetary policy and exchange rate
The Bank of Slovenia has kept its policy rates unchanged, except for the refinancing rate. On
two occasions, in December 2004 and in April 2005, it raised its refinancing rate by a total of
0.5 percentage points. The refinancing rate, currently at 3.5 percent, exceeds the ECB’s rate
by 1.5 percentage points.
In the first six months of this year, the market rate moved in an even closer corridor around
the central parity, compared with the first six months following Slovenia’s ERM2 entry on
June 28, 2004. The deviation of the market rate from the central parity did not exceed 0.06
percent. In this period, the Bank of Slovenia also did not intervene in the foreign exchange
market. In the twelve months-period until May 2005, the real effective exchange rate of the
tolar depreciated by only 0.1 percent.
Financial sector
The Financial Stability Report published by the Bank of Slovenia in June 2005 points out
that Slovenia’s banking system, capital market and insurance sector are sound and resilient to
macroeconomic shocks, and compare favorably to those of other EU members. In the
absence of major disruptions in the present trend of economic activity in Europe and in
Slovenia, there are no serious reasons for concern. Nevertheless, the Report concludes that
effective oversight of the financial system will be essential in the period leading to euro
adoption.

-3The banking system strengthened but the demanding external environment does not allow for
complacency. The Banks’ capital ratio is solid at 11.8 percent. Also, profitability has
increased owing mainly to strong non-interest income. The share of non-performing loans in
bank portfolios amounts to a mere 3 percent, and the overall quality of the banks’ portfolio is
improving. The foreign exchange risks are manageable in light of the smooth process of
transition to the euro that has already started in banks. Nevertheless, rapid growth of lending
combined with easing loan standards in the face of intensifying competition, increased
income variability and declining interest rate margins expose the banks to new risks. To
sustain the current favorable position, the Bank of Slovenia is urging the banks to stay
prudent and vigilant, and to enhance risk management, especially with regard to the interest
rate risks. In parallel, the Bank of Slovenia will be further strengthening the banking
supervision capacity and monitoring.
The insurance sector is performing relatively well. The coverage of technical provisions by
assets recorded a level of 111 percent at the end of 2003. In 2004, insurance companies also
improved their capital adequacy as measured by the surplus of the available capital above the
required minimum capital.
The claims ratio for credit insurance, which accounts for only 2 percent of insurance
companies’ total collected premium, improved significantly from the previous years to 0.66
in 2004. In view of the low proportion of credit insurance and the trend of decreasing
proportion of new banking loans insured by insurance companies (the proportion of new
loans insured by insurance companies fell by 0.6 percentage points to 2.2 percent from the
end of 2003 to the end of February 2005), there are no serious reasons for concern about the
transfer of credit risk from the banking to the insurance sector.
Euro adoption
Slovenia comfortably complies with four of the five Maastricht criteria, and has stepped up
efforts to meet the fifth, i.e. the inflation criterion. At the end of 2004, public debt amounted
to 29.4 percent of GDP and the budget deficit was at 1.9 percent of GDP, well below the
respective 60 percent and 3 percent targets. Moreover, at 4.3 percent, long term interest rates
are well within the actual limit of slightly above six percent. Also, the exchange rate has been
stable. In June 2005, the 12-month average price inflation as measured by the EMU
convergence price index dropped to 3.0 percent and lowered the difference to the EMU
convergence criterion from 1.8 percentage points in July 2004 to 0.7 percentage points.
Half way down the two-year ERM2 path, Slovenia has demonstrated the sustainability of its
macroeconomic policy required for the euro adoption. It intends to introduce the euro as its
legal tender on January 1, 2007, subject to positive convergence reports by the European
Commission and the European Central Bank and the approval of the European Council, and
following the irrevocable fixing of the tolar/euro exchange rate expected to be decided in
June 2006. A one- year testing period that will inform the convergence reports has started in
June 2005.

-4The January 2005 master plan for the euro changeover was endorsed by the Bank of Slovenia
and the Slovenian Government and builds on the November 2003 joint program for euro
adoption. The joint program defines the responsibilities for meeting the euro adoption targets.
The master plan sets the stage for resolving technical aspects of this process. The technical
preparations are coordinated by a special committee co-chaired by the Bank of Slovenia and
the Ministry of Finance. The committee includes a number of institutions each entrusted to
prepare their action plans and reports on implementation. Slovenia plans to adopt the euro
under the Big Bang scenario which provides for one week of dual circulation of tolars and
euros. To increase public awareness of the functioning of the economic and monetary union
and to provide practical advice, communication with the households and the business
community, especially the financial sector, has already been enhanced. The introduction of
the dual display of prices is envisaged by March 1, 2006.
Structural issues
In June 2005, the Government endorsed Slovenia’s new strategy for sustainable development
that sets five priority areas and defines targets, actions and milestones for the period until
2013. On the economic front, improving competitiveness, deregulating the economy,
adjusting the social model, enhancing innovation and investments into research and
development, addressing the problem of ageing population, are its most important pillars.
Conclusion
Coordination of all economic policies will be key to meeting the conditions for adopting the
euro. Monetary policy needs to preserve exchange rate stability. Fiscal policy has to continue
the gradual fiscal consolidation process, enhance the quality of public finance and contribute
to offsetting inflationary pressures. The social partners must make sure that the wage growth
in all sectors lags behind the productivity growth by at least one percentage point. The
government should allow only a moderate growth of administered prices. The financial
supervision must ensure the stability of the financial sector. A favorable external
environment would help, and a bit of luck would also be welcome.

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2005 Article IV Consultation with the
Republic of Slovenia
On July 20, 2005, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded the
Article IV consultation with the Republic of Slovenia.1
Background
Real GDP growth accelerated to 4½ percent in 2004 driven by a large positive swing in the
contribution of net foreign demand, while domestic demand growth maintained momentum.
Private consumption strengthened, though to a lesser extent than expected owing to an
apparent increase in the propensity to save. Investment growth slowed, owing to a smaller
contribution from inventory accumulation. Exports rose markedly in response to stronger import
demand in the main trading partners. However, because of a deterioration in the terms of trade
on account of higher oil and commodity prices, the external current account deficit widened to
almost 1 percent of GDP. Competitiveness remained adequate. However, owing to increased
external financing by banks to fund their lending activities, total external debt rose sharply.
Progress with disinflation continued, notwithstanding higher oil prices, a pickup in producer
prices, and a narrowing of the output gap. Year-on-year inflation declined from 4.6 percent in
December 2003 to 3.2 percent in December 2004 and fell further to 2.1 percent in May 2005.
An improved harvest, the elimination of remaining duties on imports from the European Union,

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies.
On return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by
the Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman
of the Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to
the country's authorities.

-2and increased competition in the retail market resulted in lower food prices and moderate
increases in the prices of non-food items. Disinflation was additionally reinforced by the
widening of the gap between real wage increases and productivity growth and by the
stabilization of the exchange rate after ERM2 entry on June 28, 2004.
The monetary framework changed following ERM2 entry and monetary conditions became
tighter. However, with further convergence of tolar lending interest rates and increased
competition in the banking sector, bank credit accelerated. The pickup in credit growth was
particularly strong for individuals. Upon ERM2 entry, the Bank of Slovenia ended its
depreciation policy and set the central parity to at SIT 239.64 per euro, close to the thenprevailing market rate. Since then, the market rate has not deviated from the central parity by
more than ±0.20 percent, and the Bank of Slovenia has kept its key policy interest rate (on 60day bills) unchanged at 4 percent.
The general government deficit in 2004, at 1.4 percent of GDP, was lower than envisaged in the
budget, but the expenditure structure became more rigid. Faced with uncertainties about VAT
receipts, the authorities cut spending on goods and services in the fourth quarter.
Capital expenditure from domestic resources was also lower than budgeted. However, the
wage bill exceeded the budgeted level.
Economic growth is expected to moderate to 4 percent in 2005, but would still be above
estimates of potential. Domestic demand is expected to ease, owing to a further slowdown of
inventory accumulation. In addition, factors that led to higher household saving in 2004 are
likely to persist. The stimulus to growth from net foreign demand would be small in the
foreseeable future. Export growth would ease in line with projected import demand in Slovenia’s
main trading partners, and the rising trend in import content of domestic demand is likely to
continue. With higher oil prices contributing to a further deterioration in the terms of trade,
the external current account is projected to widen to 1½ percent of GDP in 2005. The authorities
expect average inflation of about 2½ percent in 2005. The revised 2005 budget envisages a
broadly neutral fiscal stance.
Following EU accession and ERM2 entry in 2004, the authorities are concentrating on securing
a smooth transition to euro adoption in early 2007.
Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors congratulated the authorities for Slovenia’s entry into the European Union
and ERM2 in 2004 and subsequent strong economic performance. Directors considered that,
taking into account the degree of real convergence with other EU economies,
its competitiveness, and the fact that it already meets the Maastricht criteria for long-term
interest rates, the fiscal deficit, and public debt ratios, Slovenia is well positioned to adopt the
euro in early 2007. However, risks remain: although disinflation has continued, meeting the
Maastricht inflation criterion during the assessment period (June 2005-June 2006) will be
challenging, as will sustaining low inflation after euro adoption. The authorities will also need to

-3address the budgetary implications of an aging population in order to meet the medium-term
balanced budget objective.
Directors agreed that, given the intended policy stance, inflation in 2005–06 is likely to be
modest, but they cautioned that higher oil prices, continued faster-than-potential economic
growth, and larger-than-expected producer price increases could create upside inflation risks.
They welcomed the authorities’ readiness to take corrective measures—including monetary
tightening—if signs emerged that inflation would exceed the target or that the Maastricht
inflation criterion would be jeopardized. They emphasized, however, that the scope for
monetary tightening to have its intended effect on inflation within the assessment period would
become smaller as the end of the period approached. Directors supported the Bank of
Slovenia’s intention to keep policy interest rates unchanged, unless forced otherwise by market
conditions.
Directors commended the authorities for their track record of prudent fiscal policy.
They stressed the importance of maintaining a fiscal stance consistent with the aim of lowering
inflation, as envisaged in the revised 2005 budget, which will also contribute to putting the public
finances on the path to meet the official medium-term goal of structural balance. At the same
time, the need to safeguard investment expenditure to support future economic growth was
recognized. Directors noted that further fiscal consolidation would create room for higher
spending within the Stability and Growth Pact (SGP) deficit threshold in case of adverse cyclical
conditions.
Directors called on the authorities to strengthen their efforts to increase budgetary flexibility,
noting the relatively large proportion of nondiscretionary spending in the overall budget. These
expenditures should be contained, including through the reform of social entitlements and
health care; restrictions on non-selective promotions; and a slower increase in public sector
employment. Changes in pension indexation that result in higher pension payments should be
avoided. In that light, Directors encouraged the authorities to consider linking pensions to
inflation—rather than to wage growth, as is currently being considered—and addressing the
issue of pension indexation in the framework of a comprehensive reform to ensure the longterm soundness of the pension system. They cautioned against further lowering payroll taxes,
unless mechanisms are in place to ensure that the resources thus released are not used for
wage increases.
Directors welcomed the indications that productivity growth was continuing to outpace the
growth of real wages, and noted that wage restraint and greater wage flexibility will be crucial
for adjusting to asymmetric shocks in the euro area. Directors urged the authorities and social
partners to eliminate wage indexation in the Social Agreement for 2006, and to adopt a wage
setting system that allows greater productivity-based differentiation of wages. Directors
recommended that a wage pact at the national and enterprise levels be considered if
achievement of the Maastricht inflation criterion was threatened.
Directors noted that Slovenia’s banking system remains sound, with the banks adequately
capitalized and profitable and their asset quality high. At the same time, due to stiff competition

-4and interest rate convergence, banks are vulnerable to further margin compression in the
transition to euro adoption. In addition, the high share of assets held by banks with fixed interest
rates and longer maturities may raise their interest rate risks, and increased corporate
borrowing in euro may raise their credit risks. Directors therefore welcomed the Bank of
Slovenia’s intention to maintain tight oversight of financial institutions and to monitor closely
banks’ exposure to credit and interest rate risks. They encouraged the authorities to enhance
the supervision of insurance companies and to ensure that these companies have the capacity
to set pricing, provisioning and capital at appropriate levels.
Directors observed that the growth of the economy over the past decade could be attributed in
large part to the authorities’ sustained structural reform efforts, but that much remained to be
done in this area. Labor market flexibility needs to be improved, including by reducing
employment protections, and the problem of the long-term unemployed addressed.
Directors welcomed the consideration being given to further privatization, and the increased
competition in the electricity and gas markets, and urged that this be extended to other sectors,
such as telecommunications. Directors encouraged the authorities to simplify administrative
procedures and regulation and further strengthen the business environment, which would help
to attract higher levels of foreign direct investment and make the economy even more dynamic
in coming years.
