STAFF REPORT FOR THE 2011 ARTICLE IV CONSULTATION
July 7, 2011

KEY ISSUES
Near term policy stance. The economic recovery is well-entrenched, with growth projected
for this year at somewhat above potential. Inflation pressurges are contained, the financial
system is solid, international reserves are strong, the sovereign debt rating has been raised
this year to investment grade by all three ratings agencies, and the FCL appears to have
bolstered market confidence. Monetary policy is moving toward a more neutral position, but
staff is of the view that fiscal policy remains stimulative. With the output gap projected to
close in early 2012 and the balance of risks tilted toward overheating, staff cautioned that the
burden of dampening potential demand pressures in the near term would fall too much on
monetary policy.
Strengthening of the fiscal framework. Colombia’s fiscal institutions are very strong and
will be further strengthened by recently approved fiscal reforms, including a fiscal rule to
support existing fiscal responsibility legislation, inclusion of fiscal sustainability as a
constitutional criterion, and a revamping of the allocation and use of royalty payments that
will generate important savings. Still, staff underscored that revenue collections are relatively
low compared with regional peers and welcomed the authorities’ plans (presently under
discussion) to reduce distortions in the tax system and promote formal sector activity that, in
turn, would increase revenue and, in staff’s view, facilitate compliance with the fiscal rule.
Financial sector oversight. Financial system supervision is very strong and is being
strengthened further through initiatives to bolster cross-border and consolidated
supervision. Assessing capital adequacy under Basel III terms is just beginning, and staff
urged that the timetable for assessing the impact of its requirements be accelerated. An
FSAP update is scheduled for early 2013.
Labor markets. High rates of structural unemployment and poverty and widespread labor
informality constitute longstanding policy challenges.

that had started in 2006.1

Colombia’s strong policy frameworks,
including its inflation-targeting regime and
medium-term fiscal framework, provided the
authorities with policy space to undertake
timely and effective countercyclical measures
in response to the 2008-09 global crisis.
Following a short-lived contraction, economic
activity started to recover in the second half of
2009, supported by fiscal and monetary
stimulus, which helped keep real GDP growth
in positive territory. The central bank lowered
the policy rate by 600 basis points (to
3.5 percent) over the course of 2009, and the
combined public sector deficit widened to
2.7 percent of GDP (compared with near
balance in 2008).

In concluding the 2010 Article IV

consultation, Executive Directors
commended the Colombian authorities for
their sound macroeconomic management
and strong institutional framework.
Directors advised that, with inflation
expectations within the target range, the
monetary stance could be kept
accommodative until there was clear evidence
of a sustained recovery. They also noted that
the deterioration of the fiscal position in 2009,
including through a modest fiscal stimulus,
had not compromised medium-term
sustainability. Directors welcomed the
authorities' strategy of using the exchange rate

The external current account deficit
increased by almost 1 percentage point of
GDP (to 3.1 percent), reflecting a sharp
rebound in imports and the loss of the
Venezuelan market for nontraditional
products. Strong private capital inflows,
mainly FDI in the oil and energy sector, but
also other investment flows and borrowing
by the private sector toward the end of the
year, more than offset a decline in official
borrowing, resulting in an overall balance

Colombia’s investment climate seems to be a
factor in attracting FDI. Colombia is ranked
39 of 183 economies in World Bank indicators on
ease of doing business, an improvement over the
past five years. Colombia is ranked higher than
some regional peers and is particularly strong in
investor protection.

Starting in 2009, the share of portfolio and
other short-term capital inflows began to
increase. The share of net FDI in total inflows fell
below 50 percent by mid-2010 for the first time
since 2001. This is in line with developments in
other emerging markets, and reflects Colombia’s
strong fundamentals and growth prospects, as
well as global liquidity conditions.

Has Colombia’s intervention been effective?
The Colombian peso appreciated by 6.4 percent
against the U.S. dollar during 2010 and by
6.6 percent so far during 2011, but in the absence
of a counterfactual, it is difficult to assess the
overall effectiveness of intervention on the pace
of appreciation. Cross-country studies on the
effectiveness of intervention detect such an effect
(though not on the degree of appreciation). The
effectiveness is larger when the market perception
is that the currency is overvalued.2 Also,
announcements of FX purchases have an impact
on the exchange rate, but such effects fade away
when announcements become frequent.

Colombia’s intervention was fully sterilized in 2010 through
the sale of Treasury debt instruments held by the central bank
(first half of 2010) and higher government issuance of shortterm bills (second half of 2010 and so far in 2011).

In 2007, in the context of large capital inflows and
rapid credit growth, the central bank introduced
marginal reserve requirements on domestic deposits
and increased loan provisioning requirements. In
addition, it placed unremunerated reserve
requirements (URR) on foreign borrowing and
portfolio inflows of all maturities. The URRs were
successful in altering the composition of capital
inflows (reducing foreign borrowing and non-resident
portfolio inflows), though they did not appear to have
had a significant impact on the volume of total inflows.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND 19

COLOMBIA

Box 4. Macroprudential Policies
Colombia has in place a broad set of
macroprudential tools that is more extensive
than in their regional peers. For the most part, the
authorities have used micro-prudential tools to
control macroprudential risks. These include those
aimed at limiting the exposure of financial
intermediaries to specific risks (e.g., loan-to-value
ratio limits) to increase resilience to shocks and
those geared towards reducing the overall
amplitude of financial cycles (e.g., dynamic
provisioning) that would provide for a more stable
credit supply.
A legal mandate for macroprudential policy has
not been established, which is the current
practice in many countries in the region. Four
institutions constitute the financial stability

committee—the central bank, the Superintendencia
Financiera (SF), the Ministry of Finance and the
Deposit Insurance Agency. The Ministry of Finance is
the regulator for the entire financial system, and the
SF is the primary supervisor for the financial system.
The central bank adheres to a financial stability
mandate (although this is not codified in the law);
regulates the foreign exchange system and is the
lender of last resort. The deposit insurance agency
implements decisions taken by the SF on intervened
deposit-taking institutions. This committee has
recently redoubled efforts to coordinate and
facilitate information exchange. Each of the four
institutions retains its micro-prudential responsibility
to: identify risk, implement and enforce policies, and
report to Congress.

amendments approved in June. These
included: (i) adding fiscal sustainability as a
“constitutional criterion” (to limit the impact of
fiscally costly rulings of the constitutional
court); and (ii) reforming the system of
royalties to achieve a more equitable
distribution of royalty payments across regions
and to save a portion of such royalties in a
sub-national savings and stabilization fund.

fiscal target to create fiscal space quickly. The

Estimates from the standard CGER-type
methodologies suggest that, as of end-April
2011, the peso is broadly in line with its longterm fundamentals. Results from the
macroeconomic balance approach suggest that
the real effective exchange rate is about
10 percent above its medium-term equilibrium,
mainly reflecting current account deficits
somewhat larger than the current account norm.
Results from the equilibrium real exchange rate
approach suggest that the observed appreciation
is in line with the equilibrium response to
improved terms of trade. The external stability
approach, which focuses on the relationship
between the sustainability of the external position
and current account flows, also suggests that the
peso is broadly in line with fundamentals.

A gradual strengthening of the current
account, mainly resulting from a higher oil
balance surplus, is consistent with continued
appreciation of the equilibrium real exchange
rate. The current account deficit, which was
3.1 percent of GDP in 2010, is projected to decline
to 2 percent in 2016, owing to higher production
and exports of commodities, especially oil, which
will keep the trade balance in surplus.
Nontraditional exports, which declined in 2009
and 2010 because of disruptions of trade with
Venezuela, are not expected to be adversely
effected by the appreciation of the peso over the
medium term due to expected improvements in
the business climate and labor markets.

Sources: Ministry of Finance; Banco de la República; and Fund staff estimates and projections.
1/ Combined public sector includes the central, regional and local governments, social security, and public sector
enterprises. Figures for 2008 and projections reflect exclusion of Ecopetrol operations and privatization of health care,
which reduced revenue and spending by about 2 percent of GDP and 1.5 percent of GDP, respectively, in 2008.
2/ Expenditure reported on commitments basis.
3/ Payments for fuel subsidies granted in 2007-08 were distributed across the 2007-2009 budgets. At end-2008, a fuel price
stabilization fund was created to eliminate fuel subsidies.
4/ Includes adjustments to put spending on commitment basis and the change in unpaid bills of selected nonfinancial public enterprises.
5/ Interest payments on public banks restructuring bonds and mortgage debt relief related costs.
6/ Adjusts for the output gap, oil price projections, fuel subsidies, and one-off relief expenditures.
7/ Includes income tax payments and dividends from Ecopetrol that correspond to earnings from the previous year, and royalties to local
governments.
8/ Includes Ecopetrol and Banco de la República's outstanding external debt.

ANNEX IV. COLOMBIA: STATISTICAL ISSUES
(as of June 15, 2011)
I.
Assessment of Data Adequacy for Surveillance
Data provision is adequate for surveillance.
Real sector
The National Department of Statistics (DANE) is responsible for the compilation of the national
accounts, although the Banco de la República (BdR) compiles the financial accounts. Estimates of
GDP by the production and the expenditure approaches both use 2005 as their base year. GDP
compilation conforms to the methodological recommendations of the System of National Accounts
1993 (1993 SNA). The rebasing of the national accounts’ base year included a change in the index
formulae (historically it was a Laspeyres fixed-base index, but it is a Laspeyres chain index with the
2005 base year). The main implications of the rebasing are that the 2000 and 2005 are not
comparable and the chain index is associated with non-additivity of the components. The rebasing
also resulted in a revision of the nominal GDP reflecting improvements in source data.
Government finance statistics
The Ministry of Finance and Public Credit (MFPC) is responsible for the compilation of public
revenue, expenditure, and financing data. While significant progress has been made, there is still a
need to improve the timeliness and coverage of fiscal data, develop timely and reliable data on the
finances of local governments, and improve monitoring of floating debts. Data cover the
nonfinancial public sector (NFPS), but coverage of “above-the-line” operations of units outside the
national administration is not exhaustive due to capacity constraints.
The General Accounting Office (GAO) has developed a single accounting database for the public
sector. The GAO accounting classification is bridged to the GFSM 2001 framework to compile GFS on
accrual and cash bases.
Financial sector statistics
The BdR is in charge of compiling data on the financial sector, while the Superintendency of Banks
and the Superintendency of Securities compile data in their respective areas. Fund technical
assistance missions have placed special emphasis on issues supportive of data quality, including
interagency cooperation and procedures to ensure data consistency.
Balance of payments and external debt
The BdR is in charge of compiling and disseminating balance of payments statistics. Quarterly data
have been produced since 1994, and the BdR adopted the BPM5 standard in 1998. Balance of
payment statistics have been extended to cover transactions in the free trade zones. Improved
surveys, particularly in the service sector, have enhanced coverage and consistency and financial
account data are now based on actual disbursement rather than registers.

COLOMBIA 2011 ARTICLE IV REPORT—INFORMATIONAL ANNEX

The 2005 data ROSC mission recommended that the BdR, in consultation with the DANE, develop a
methodology to include unrecorded trade in the balance of payments on a timely basis. The BdR
should reclassify some FDI equity transactions to portfolio equity, and adjust the related investment
income series accordingly. Also, it should continue efforts to identify government bonds issued
abroad and purchased by residents as well as those purchased by residents on the secondary
market.
The BdR also compiles and disseminates data on International Investment Position statistics, External
Debt statistics, and the Data Template on International Reserves and Foreign Currency Liquidity.

Data Standards and Quality
A data ROSC was published in October2006.
Colombia subscribes to the Special Data
Dissemination Standard (SDDS) and metadata

Standards Bulletin Board (DSBB).
III.
Reporting to STA (optional)
Colombia reports annual GFS to STA for general government and its subsectors on accrual and cash
bases for publication in the Government Finance Statistics Yearbook (GFS Yearbook). Data for the
consolidated general government are only available from 2008 onward because of shortcomings in
the consolidation process of past data. Currently, no high frequency data are reported for
publication in IFS. The authorities use the standardized report forms for reporting monetary data for
the central bank (Form 1SR), other depository corporations (Form 2SR), and other financial
corporations (Form 4SR) to STA.

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2011 Article IV Consultation with
Colombia
On July 20, 2011, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded the
Article IV consultation with Colombia.1
Background
With strong policy and institutional frameworks, Colombia’s economy exhibited resilience
during the global crisis, and the output recovery is well entrenched. Following a short-lived
contraction, economic activity began to recover in the second half of 2009 supported by
appropriate countercyclical fiscal and monetary policies, and a Flexible Credit Line
arrangement, which helped keep real growth in positive territory (1.5 percent for the year as a
whole). Activity gained further momentum in 2010 when real GDP grew by 4.3 percent (despite
the adverse impact of severe flooding), inflation was near the mid-point of the official target
range of 2−4 percent, commercial and consumer credit began to rebound strongly around midyear, and the external currency account deficit widened to 3.1 percent of GDP, reflecting a
sharp pick up in imports.

1

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On
return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the
Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the
Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the
country's authorities. An explanation of any qualifiers used in summings up can be found here:
http://www.imf.org/external/np/sec/misc/qualifiers.htm

2

Countercyclical macroeconomic policies in support of this performance included: the central
bank lowering its policy rate by 650 basis points to a historic low of 3 percent between early
2009 and early 2011, an expansionary fiscal policy stance, with the combined public sector
deficit widening to around 3 percent of GDP in 2009 and 2010 (compared with near balance in
2008). The financial system was little impacted by the global shocks and the downturn in
activity as capital adequacy and profitability remained strong and non-performing loans
increased only slightly.
In 2010, global liquidity conditions and favorable prospects for the Colombia economy resulted
in renewed appreciation pressures on the peso. The bulk of the inflows were related to foreign
direct investment, but portfolio and other investment inflows began accelerating toward the end
of the year. In response to these pressures, the central bank purchased just over US$3 billion
in the foreign exchange market through its pre-announced intervention program of purchasing
at least US$20 million per day over a specified time horizon (most recently extended until
September 30, 2011), and the peso appreciated by just 1 percent against the U.S. dollar
through the remainder of the year since the program was initiated.
The outlook for 2011 is generally positive. Real GDP growth in 2011 is projected at about
5 percent, led by domestic demand and favorable terms of trade. Inflation is expected to
remain within the central bank target range as the economy still operates with some slack (the
output gap is projected to close in early 2012) and the impact of further anticipated peso
appreciation. Inflation expectations are well anchored supported by the strong credibility of the
central bank. In response to the cyclical recovery, the central bank has started to normalize
monetary conditions (with the policy rate increased by 125 basis points so far during 2011).
The external current account deficit is expected to narrow to 2.6 percent of GDP as a result of
higher oil and other commodity prices. Strong private capital inflows (mainly foreign direct
investment) are expected to result in an overall balance of payments surplus and continued
appreciation pressures.
The government is taking important steps to strengthen the fiscal framework. The strategy
comprises a structural fiscal rule for the central government, constitutional amendments that
establish fiscal sustainability as a constitutional criterion and a more equitable distribution of
royalties, and the creation of a national sovereign wealth fund.
Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors commended the Colombian authorities for their sound macroeconomic
policies and strong institutional frameworks. Economic recovery is well entrenched and the
outlook is positive. Inflation pressures are contained, the financial sector is solid, and market
sentiment is favorable. The main challenges ahead are to normalize the macropolicy mix to
stave off overheating pressures, strengthen revenue collection, and reduce unemployment and
labor market informality.
Directors generally agreed that a speedier exit from fiscal stimulus would be desirable in light
of the closing output gap. A tighter fiscal stance would also help mitigate an unexpected surge

3
in capital inflows and avoid overburdening monetary policy. Directors encouraged the
authorities to save any overperformance in government revenues this year and restrain
expenditure where feasible.
Directors welcomed the recent legislative reforms to strengthen further the medium-term fiscal
framework, including the adoption of a fiscal rule for the central government. They noted that
these reforms will bolster Colombia’s commitment to fiscal sustainability, and encouraged the
authorities to make them operational in a timely manner. Directors supported the authorities’
plans to broaden the tax base and reduce distortions to spur formal sector activity. They
welcomed the creation of a national Sovereign Wealth Fund to manage windfall fiscal gains.
Directors stressed the importance of developing a strategy to address the large contingent
liabilities in the pension and healthcare systems.
Directors noted that the inflation targeting framework has served Colombia well. They
supported the gradual normalization of the monetary stance to mitigate inflation pressures
without exacerbating capital inflows. Directors underscored that exchange rate flexibility,
alongside limited intervention in the foreign exchange market, should remain the primary tool
for absorbing capital inflows. Additional tools, including strengthened macroprudential
regulation and capital flow management policies, can play a role in the event that capital
inflows threaten financial stability. Most Directors supported the policy intention to further
improve reserve coverage.
Directors noted that the financial system is sound. Credit and asset market developments
however should be closely monitored for overheating risks. Directors welcomed improvements
in financial supervision, particularly recent measures to improve the coordination of information
exchange, bank resolution, and the design of macroprudential regulation. Directors
encouraged the authorities to complete their analysis of the composition of bank capital and
liquidity under Basel III.
Directors urged the authorities to build on recent labor market reforms to lower unemployment
and labor market informality. They welcomed the authorities’ measures to improve incentives
for firms to operate in the formal sector, but stressed the need to tackle remaining structural
impediments including by broadening cuts in the still high labor taxation and addressing the
binding minimum wage.

Statement by María Angélica Arbeláez, Alternate Executive Director for Colombia
July 20, 2011
On behalf of the Colombian authorities, I would like to thank staff for the constructive
meetings held in Bogota. My authorities broadly agree with staff’s assessment and policy
recommendations and appreciate that marginal differences in perceptions with regard to
some specific aspects were addressed in the staff report.
Economic outlook
The economic recovery began in 2010 and remains strong in 2011. After the solid
performance of the economy in the first quarter of this year (5.1 percent year-on-year), the
government and the central bank (Banco de la República, BR) recently raised their forecast
from 4.5 percent to between 5 and 6 percent for 2011, and they expect the current negative
output gap to close before the end of this year. As pointed out by staff, there are no clear
signs of overheating, as no price bubbles have been observed in asset markets (e.g. housing,
equity) and credit growth remains manageable. Nonetheless, macroeconomic policy strategy
has shifted towards tighter monetary policy and a gradual exit from fiscal stimulus policy.
Fundamentals in the economy remain strong. In 2011, inflation is expected to be low (3.1
percent in December year-on-year according to the central bank’s projections). The fiscal
deficit will be close to 3 percent of GDP and the public gross debt around 36 percent of
GDP. The current account deficit will narrow to 2.6 percent of GDP, financed mostly by
FDI inflows, and the level of international reserves remains adequate. In addition, the credit
rating on the sovereign debt was raised to investment grade, and the FCL has played a major
role in providing protection against tail risks.
Looking ahead, Colombia’s strong institutions coupled with a solid framework that has been
put in place (e.g. inflation targeting, flexible exchange regime and an ambitious set of fiscal
tools) will allow the government to maintain sound macroeconomic fundamentals.
Nonetheless, many challenges remain, such as improving road infrastructure, bringing down
unemployment and informality, and improving living conditions for a non-negligible part of
the population. The government is taking concrete actions to address these issues and
enhance competitiveness, with the medium-term objective of raising the potential growth
rate, which today is around 4.5 percent.
Fiscal policy
Colombia has put in place a solid and comprehensive institutional framework in order to
ensure discipline and debt sustainability, both at central and regional levels. In 1997 and
2000, three laws were enacted aiming to regulate the regions’ indebtedness and to force fiscal
discipline and transparency. With regard to the Central Government, The Fiscal

2
Responsibility and Transparency Law adopted in 2003—which includes a Medium-Term
Fiscal Framework and a Medium-Term Expenditure Plan—set specific ceilings of fiscal
deficit and financing, and establishes maximum levels of spending. In addition to that, and
with the purpose of creating mechanisms for additional savings during boom periods, three
ambitious reforms were recently approved by Congress: a) The Fiscal Rule, which limits the
structural deficit of the Central Government, creates mechanisms to increase savings from
the expected large growth in hydrocarbon export related revenues, and develops rules to
manage countercyclical fiscal policies; b) The Fiscal Sustainability Legislative Act, which
incorporates fiscal sustainability as a general principle in the Constitution; and c) The
Royalties Reform, an amendment to the Constitution that mandates that both regional and
central governments save a large amount of hydrocarbon royalties (30 percent). It also
directs ways to distribute royalties more fairly among the regions, and seeks to enhance the
spending efficiency of such royalties.
As staff has mentioned, the authorities are preparing the supporting legislation and are
committed to passing it before 2012. In particular, concerning the Fiscal Rule, it is the
highest priority for the Colombian government that the process of developing and monitoring
key parameters for the rule is technically robust, transparent and independent, and is
committed to acting accordingly. Moreover, the Fiscal Rule is perceived as an essential tool
for fiscal discipline and the authorities will gradually reduce the Central Government’s
deficit until reaching the target of below 1 percent of GDP from 2022 onwards—as
established by the Rule, which will be met through significant spending cuts independent of
new tax reforms.
With respect to revenues, the authorities have acknowledged the need to improve the tax
structure. Indeed, as mentioned in the staff report the new government enacted a tax reform
in 2010, which eliminated some exemptions, broadened the tax base, and gradually
dismounted distortionary taxes such as the financial transactions tax. Looking ahead, they see
further room to improve the tax structure although through measures that stimulate private
activity and reduce the informal economy. Tax adjustments could include broadening the tax
base and reducing tariffs (the income tariff of 33 percent is extremely high compared to peers
and competitors), and eliminating some VAT rebates. They expect significant results from
such measures, as they will generate higher economic dynamism. The Colombian Ministry of
Finance valued the recent Fund’s TA mission on tax reform and shares some of the
recommendations, and is designing a tax package that will be presented to Congress when
they consider conditions are appropriate.
Over the short term, the fiscal adjustment in 2011 was delayed due to severe flooding in the
country. The floods cost around 0.5 percent of GDP in 2011, and the total reconstruction
costs are estimated to be between 2 and 3 percent of GDP. It must be noted that the
authorities have tackled this negative shock by increasing taxes and reducing spending to
ensure an unchanged fiscal stance, highlighting their commitment to fiscal stability.

3
Moreover, the budget for 2011 that was approved before the tax reform of 2010 was not
modified according to the expected additional revenues. Therefore, the revenues driven by
the reform—which have been higher than expected—combined with the spending lower than
envisaged, will likely result in a lower deficit by around 0.4 percent of GDP than the one
projected by the authorities (3.4 percent of GDP for the combined public sector). Should
these circumstances materialized, and considering that the target for 2012 is a further
significant reduction, the authorities perceive that the fiscal policy would not be pro-cyclical.
Monetary policy
The inflation targeting regime adopted in the late 1990s, has served the economy well, as it
has brought down inflation significantly, has increased monetary policy credibility and has
anchored inflation expectations, giving the authorities the flexibility and opportunity to react
to the rapidly changing macroeconomic environment.
After two years of an accommodative monetary stance, that helped the country to cope with
the global financial crisis, the BR started tightening monetary policy in 2011. Since February,
it has raised its benchmark interest rate by 25 basis points every month, with the double
objective of keeping inflation low/stable and smoothing the business cycle. The path toward
a neutral monetary stance remains a precautionary and medium-term policy: in circumstances
of high commodity prices and higher hydrocarbons’ production, close vigilance is warranted
in order to avoid overheating and potential financial imbalances. In the short run, despite
contained inflation (3.2 percent year-on-year in June) and inflation expectations, the BR is
carefully monitoring the evolution of asset prices and credit, and is prepared to act promptly
should signs of overheating appear.
Capital inflows
Colombia is also fully committed to exchange rate flexibility. The authorities see the
exchange rate as the most important shock absorber to mitigate the effects of the surge in
capital inflows. As staff pointed out, capital inflows have continued to increase, mostly under
the form of FDI, although recently portfolio flows have risen as well. The Colombian
authorities believe this is a positive trend, but they recognize some potential effects
associated with a surge in these inflows, such as financial instability and excess exchange
rate appreciation. The main policy response that the central bank has used to contain excess
appreciation in the currency has been the program of pre-announced daily purchases of
foreign exchange (US$20 million per day). However, it is worth mentioning that besides
correcting exchange rate misalignments, the main objective of interventions has been to build
up international reserves. The central bank has found that this transparent, small and
predictable intervention is more effective than a large-scale and unpredictable accumulation
of international reserves. According to BR’s analyses, interventions have been effective,
especially when the amounts were fixed and when the exchange rate was excessively low

4
(misaligned). There are two reasons for that, first because the likelihood of misalignment is
higher and second because interventions with fixed amounts are not a signal of defending a
specific level that the markets could subsequently attack.
Looking ahead, and should inflows keep rising, the policy response will depend on the nature
of these inflows (private sector external indebtedness is being closely monitored) and
whether the impact is mainly on the exchange rate or on the broader stability of the financial
system. Given the complexity of this situation, the BR’s purpose is to clearly identify the
problem and adopt the adequate solution.
Unemployment, informality and poverty
High structural unemployment rate is one of the major challenges for the Colombian
government. The economic downturn of 2008 entailed an increase in unemployment, after
several years of reduction. However, improvements have been observed in 2011: the
unemployment rate in May was 11.1 percent compared to 12 percent in May of 2010, and the
decline was especially strong in rural unemployment which went down from 8.6 percent to
7.5 percent. In addition, the quality of labor has enhanced, as salaried employment has grown
while non-salaried has declined.
The authorities recognize that labor costs are high in Colombia, but several studies show that
their reduction may have a limited impact on employment creation, aside from being
politically difficult. Under these circumstances, the strategy to tackle unemployment—and
bringing it down to one digit—gives weight to the promotion of larger-scale economic
activity (focused on labor intensive sectors such as road infrastructure and agriculture).
Nonetheless, the authorities have also taken steps to reduce labor costs and incentive
formalization. The Formalization and First Employment Law was recently enacted, which
dictates the reduction of labor taxes with the view to promote formalization of small
businesses and to stimulate employment for youth, where unemployment is concentrated.
Although the law is still new, its impact has been remarkable: it is estimated that around
400,000 small and medium businesses were formalized.
Finally, successive Colombian governments have been doing strong efforts to reduce poverty
and have put in place several programs, including subsidies and targeted assistance schemes.
Indeed, although still high, it has substantially decreased over the past years. Using the
standard and comparable index of poverty based on income used by the World Bank—
defined as the percentage of the population living with less than USD 2.5—we observe that
poverty has declined from around 20 percent in 2000 to 16.4 percent in 2009 (close to Latin
American average) and the goal of the government is to reach 9.0 percent in 2014. Other
calculations of poverty using different methodologies show different figures. In the chart
presented by staff in Box 3, the poverty index of each country is defined domestically
therefore they are not comparable. Indeed, the poverty line defined as the value of the basic
market basket in Colombia (as well as in Mexico) almost double the value used in other Latin

5
American countries; therefore the rate of poverty appears to be much higher. Nonetheless the
government acknowledges that poverty is still high and all efforts are focused on attaining a
more balanced and pro-poor growth.
