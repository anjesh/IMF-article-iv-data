PHILIPPINES
Staff Report for the 2004 Article IV Consultation and
Post-Program Monitoring Discussions
Prepared by the Asia and Pacific Department
(In consultation with other departments)
Approved by Masahiko Takeda and Michael Hadjimichael
February 4, 2005
•

Discussions were held in Manila during November 4–17, 2004. The mission met with key
government officials, including Finance Secretary Amatong, Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP)
Governor Buenaventura, Budget Secretary Boncodin, Energy Secretary Perez, Trade and Industry
Secretary Purisima, several legislators including Senate President Drilon and House Speaker de
Venecia, other senior officials and representatives of the private sector and labor unions. The team
comprised Messrs. Takeda (Head), Gordon, Haksar (Resident Representative), Singh, Baqir, and
Ishi (all APD), Fletcher (FAD), and Schellekens (MFD). Mr. Burgess (PDR) assisted with the
preparation of this report. Ms. Amador (OED) also joined the discussions.

•

The previous Article IV Consultation was concluded on March 5, 2004. At that time,
Executive Directors noted that the Philippines faced key areas of weakness and vulnerability.
Despite important economic reforms in recent years and favorable macroeconomic performance,
there was an urgent need for the authorities to implement comprehensive reforms in the fiscal,
banking, and power sectors. Absent such reforms, the economy’s vulnerabilities would increase.

•

The Philippines has accepted the obligations under Article VIII, maintaining an exchange
system free of restrictions on payments and transfers for current international transactions.

•

The authorities are attempting to strengthen the statistical base, which suffers from several
deficiencies that hamper surveillance. The data ROSC published in August 2004 identified
national accounts and balance of payments statistics as particularly weak. The authorities are
recompiling balance of payments and public sector debt statistics with the assistance of STA.

•

The authorities see benefits from continuing Post Program Monitoring (PPM) until the
fiscal position strengthens, even though outstanding borrowing from the Fund has fallen well
below 100 percent of quota. The next PPM mission is expected to take place in mid-2005.

•

The authorities published the staff report for the August 2004 PPM discussions for the first
time. The authorities will make a decision on whether to publish this staff report closer to the
Board meeting.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
The Philippines faces long-standing problems in the fiscal, power and banking sectors. The
nonfinancial public sector deficit has been 5½ percent of GDP in recent years, while the level
of public debt rose above GDP in 2003. The primary cause of the fiscal problem has been a
significant decline in the ratio of tax revenue to GDP. A sharp increase in the losses of the
public power utility has also played a role. In addition, the banking system is
undercapitalized with one-quarter of assets nonperforming. Exposure to government
securities has also significantly increased. Large external financing requirements and high
debt levels make the Philippines vulnerable to changes in market sentiment and global
financial market conditions.
Since taking office in July 2004, the new administration has formulated a set of reforms to
address these problems. Progress with implementing these reforms is being made. Congress
has passed two of President Arroyo’s proposed tax measures, including a bill increasing
alcohol and tobacco excises, which is expected to yield about 0.2 percent of GDP in annual
revenue. A VAT rate hike (which would yield 0.5 percent of GDP) is under discussion in
Congress. In the banking sector, the disposal of nonperforming assets has begun. In the
power sector, a 40 percent hike in generation tariffs (yielding 0.7 percent of GDP) has been
provisionally awarded, while the sale of a large generation plant has also been announced. In
the mining sector, the Supreme Court’s decision that foreign control of mining projects is not
unconstitutional has opened the way for FDI.
However, the major part of the reform effort that is necessary remains unfinished, and, as
evidenced by the recent sovereign ratings downgrade, there are risks that the quality and
implementation of reforms will disappoint financial markets. The Philippines is also at risk
should global markets prove to be less liquid than they were in 2004 and interest rates were
to rise. These vulnerabilities will remain high until the fiscal and structural problems are
solved.
In this light, staff advocated that:
•

fiscal consolidation efforts be significantly front-loaded, so as to send a strong
signal to markets about the commitment to tackling the fiscal problem. This will
require the passage of further tax measures with a clear revenue impact, such as
raising the VAT rate, and that much of the additional revenue be saved.

•

power sector reforms be accelerated, with priority given to the privatization of
transmission and generation assets.

•

the BSP raise interest rates, so as to guide inflationary expectations down.

•

passage of the amendments to the BSP Charter be expedited, so as to strengthen
bank supervision and facilitate recapitalization of the banking sector.

I. INTRODUCTION AND BACKGROUND
1.
In early 2004, the Philippines stood at a critical point. Nonfinancial public sector
(NFPS) debt had risen above GDP, and the fiscal deficit, already 5½ percent of GDP in 2003,
looked set to increase further, reflecting the failure to reverse a significant decline in tax
revenue and mounting losses at the National Power Corporation (NPC). Substantive revenue
measures were required, but were precluded by the upcoming May 2004 elections. Poor asset
quality in the banking system was also a serious concern. Moreover, considerable uncertainty
surrounded the election, which promised to be closely-fought and threatened to lead to
populist policies.
2.
The 2003 Article IV Consultation was concluded in March 2004 against this
backdrop of heightened uncertainty. During the discussions, the Fund stressed the urgency
of implementing comprehensive reforms to address the economy’s vulnerabilities and
achieve a sustainable fiscal position. Three sets of actions, many of which echoed Fund
advice in past consultations, were identified as critical: tax measures, such as raising excises
and VAT; power sector reforms, including higher electricity tariffs and privatization; and
strengthening the banking system, particularly through empowering supervisors to deal with
distressed institutions. The authorities recognized the need for these actions, but noted that
the speed of implementation was being affected by the lead-up to the elections. At a
minimum, they endeavored to avoid fiscal policy slippages in the pre-election period.
3.
One year later, progress is being made in implementing reforms. In the power
sector, a 40 percent hike in generation tariffs (yielding revenue of 0.7 percent of GDP) has
been provisionally awarded to NPC, and the authorities have announced the sale of a large
generation plant. In the fiscal sector, tight control has been maintained over the budget, and a
tax measure increasing excises on alcohol and tobacco (yielding 0.2 percent of GDP) has
been passed by Congress (Table 1). In the banking sector, banks have begun to use the
special purpose vehicle (SPV) framework to dispose of a portion of nonperforming assets,
and legal amendments that would strengthen bank supervision have been submitted to
Congress. In the mining sector, a recent Supreme Court ruling allowing foreign control of
mining projects has opened the way for FDI.
4.
Nonetheless, much more remains to be done. While financial markets have been
relatively stable since the election, the

II. RECENT ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS
5.
GDP growth has exceeded expectations, but unemployment remains high. With
exports staging a recovery, and consumption boosted by overseas remittances and the
election, GDP grew by a little over 6 percent in 2004, up from 4¾ percent in 2003. On the
production side, the growth drivers were strong performances by agriculture and services
such as telecommunications, business process outsourcing (BPO) and tourism. Employment
increased by 3.6 percent in 2004, mainly reflecting the rapid creation of services sector jobs.
Even so, unemployment averaged 11.8 percent, up from 11.4 percent a year earlier.1
6.

Inflation has risen above the target range. The rate of inflation (1994 base)
climbed to 7.9 percent (y/y) in December,

Nonetheless, some signs have emerged of

more broad-based inflationary pressures,

including a rise in core inflation.3 The
Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP) has so far kept policy rates on hold, preferring to wait for
more definitive evidence that inflation is becoming generalized before taking monetary
policy action.
7.
The fiscal deficit is set to edge down. The national government deficit (authorities’
definition) is estimated to have declined to 3.8 percent of GDP in 2004, below the budget
target of 4.2 percent of GDP, and down from 4.6 percent of GDP in 2003. Revenue is
estimated to have remained broadly unchanged as a share of GDP, while primary spending
has been compressed. The major sources of expenditure savings were personnel services, due
to the absence of a general wage increase for the second consecutive year, and transfers to
local government units (LGUs) staying fixed in nominal terms as a result of the re-enactment

1

Poverty also remains high, with almost one sixth of the population living on less than $1 a
day, and the achievement of a number of MDG targets is in doubt, particularly those relating
to child malnutrition and maternal mortality (Annex VII).

2

Inflation measured using the recently introduced 2000 based CPI rose to 8.6 percent in
December 2004 (y/y) and averaged 6.0 percent for the year.
3

The official measure of core inflation has risen approximately in tandem with headline
inflation, reaching 7.6 percent (y/y) in December (1994 base). Alternative measures of core
inflation also show a similar acceleration (Figure 2).

of the 2003 budget. However, with NPC losses expanding from 1.1 percent of GDP in 2003
to 1.5 percent of GDP in 2004, the NFPS deficit is estimated to have only declined to
5.3 percent of GDP in 2004, compared to 5.6 percent of GDP in 2003.
8.
The balance of payments proved fairly resilient in 2004. Strong growth of exports,
tourism receipts, and remittances more than offset higher oil imports, causing the current
account surplus to increase slightly to an estimated 4½ percent of GDP in 2004.4 For much of
the year, this surplus looked insufficient to finance net capital outflows and negative errors
and omissions, and a loss of foreign exchange reserves was expected. However, in the fourth
quarter, the weak U.S. dollar took pressure off the peso and allowed the BSP to make modest
purchases of foreign exchange.5 As a result, reserves, adjusted for pledged assets, ended the
year up slightly at $15 billion (119 percent of short-term debt by residual maturity). The BSP
was also able to wind down the oversold non-deliverable forward (NDF) position of about
$0.8 billion built up during the pre-election uncertainties in early 2004.
III. NEAR-TERM OUTLOOK AND RISKS
9.
A number of uncertainties weigh on the near-term outlook. The rapid growth
in 2004 is unlikely to be sustained, particularly given slowing global demand in the
7

information technology sector. Thus,

GDP is expected to grow at a more

moderate 4¾ percent in 2005. One
5

source of downside risk is that the

ongoing depreciation of the
U.S. dollar could become disorderly

and lead to even weaker global

growth. Another is that oil prices

should oil prices drop from their
current level. There is further upside if implementation of reforms proves to be particularly
strong, although the benefits will mostly accrue over the medium term.

4

While there have been recent improvements in the quality of balance of payments data,
remaining reporting gaps and misclassifications continue to make the data difficult to
interpret (Annex VI).

5

During this period, the peso-dollar exchange rate was relatively stable. However, the
authorities’ stated objective is inflation targeting and BSP intervention is aimed at smoothing
out undue short-term fluctuations rather than maintaining a particular exchange rate.
6

A $10 per barrel increase in oil prices is estimated to lead to a decline of ¾ percentage
points in the Philippines’ growth and a deterioration in the current account balance of about
1¼ percent of GDP.

-9-

10.
The major source of vulnerability arises from the large external debt and
financing requirements. Vulnerabilities are likely to rise in 2005 even in the absence of
adverse shocks due to the less benign external environment of rising global interest rates and
tighter liquidity, which could lead to more discrimination by foreign investors and more
difficulty in meeting the sizable public sector external commercial borrowing needs
(estimated by staff at $4–4½ billion (5-6 percent of GDP) if reserves are to be maintained at
comfortable levels). The high level of external debt makes the economy extremely vulnerable
to a sharp rise in global interest rates; staff estimate that an increase in rates of 100 basis
points would add about $0.3 billion to interest payments in 2005. External financing
difficulties could also be triggered by the markets losing patience with the speed at which the
Philippines is implementing reform.
IV. REPORT ON POLICY DISCUSSIONS
11.
Staff reiterated the need for rapid progress in implementing comprehensive
economic reforms. Staff welcomed the new administration’s reform plans, as well as the
broad awareness of the fiscal problem among the politicians who met with the mission.
However, staff expressed concern that implementation of reforms was proceeding slowly and
that markets might lose patience. Some of the past fiscal problems had political economy
roots (Box 1) and staff hoped that the authorities would be able to capitalize on the
administration’s strengthened majorities in Congress to take bold upfront actions. Such a
strategy would recognize that reforms would only become more difficult as the term of the
administration progressed and politicians became distracted by the next election.
12.
The authorities, by contrast, considered reforms to be proceeding at a
reasonable pace. Substantive progress had already been made with power sector reforms.
With regard to tax reforms, the new Congress had only started working in July, and given the
time taken to forge political consensus on individual measures, it was necessary to be
realistic as to what was achievable. In any case, although only one tax measure was passed
during 2004, a number of bills were set to be passed early in 2005.
A. Fiscal Policy
13.
The fiscal problems in the
Philippines stem primarily from a longterm decline in the revenue effort. NFPS
revenue fell by 6 percentage points of GDP
between 1997 and 2003 due to weak tax
administration, nonindexation of excises to
inflation, and the failure to combine trade
liberalization with offsetting revenue
measures, as well as the government’s
decision in 2002 to cap increases in electricity
tariffs.7 Over the past two years, the

One response to the revenue decline has been a squeeze on capital spending, which has
fallen from almost 4 percent of GDP in the late 1990s to about 2¾ percent of GDP in 2004.

authorities have attempted to strengthen tax administration, including through registration
checks, prosecution of tax evaders, lifestyle checks, dismissal of corrupt tax officials, and
computerized matching of VAT receipts. However, while these efforts have arrested the
decline in the tax to GDP ratio, they have yet to cause any increase. Staff therefore welcomed
the new administration’s goal of raising significant additional revenue through new tax
measures, as well as the extra revenue that will accrue to NPC as a result of the tariff
increase.
14.
Staff recommended that the NFPS deficit be reduced by about 2 percentage
points of GDP in 2005. The proposed 2005 budget aims to reduce the national government
deficit to 3.6 percent of GDP, primarily via spending restraint, again including no general
wage increase.8 Combined with lower NPC losses, staff projected that the NFPS deficit
would decline by about 1 percent of GDP to 4½ percent of GDP in 2005. Staff argued that,
while desirable, this adjustment would not significantly reduce debt levels or vulnerabilities
(Annex 1). The authorities agreed that there was a need to front load fiscal adjustment and
hoped that revenue from the new tax measures, which are not included in the 2005 budget,
might make this possible. Some of this revenue would be needed to cover new expenditure in
priority areas such as infrastructure spending. Nonetheless, staff recommended that a
sufficient portion be saved so as to lower the NFPS deficit to 3½ percent of GDP in 2005. An
initial adjustment of this size would provide a powerful signal of the authorities’ commitment
to fiscal consolidation.
15.
However, with most of the tax measures still being debated by Congress, the
prospects for front-loaded fiscal adjustment are uncertain. To date, only one tax measure
with a clear revenue impact—higher alcohol, cigarette, and tobacco excises yielding about
0.2 percent of GDP—has been passed. Staff therefore looked forward to early action on other
fronts. Petroleum excises are low by international standards, but the authorities noted the
difficulty of raising them in the current environment of high oil prices.9 Staff have long
advocated increasing the VAT rate, which is also relatively low, and the authorities seemed
more open to this possibility than in earlier discussions. Indeed, they have since decided to
seek an immediate increase in the VAT rate from 10 to 12 percent.
16.
Rationalizing fiscal incentives could be a substantial revenue raiser. The
authorities were proposing various initiatives in this regard, of which staff strongly supported
the proposal to eliminate incentives from a large number of disparate economic laws,
including those given to cooperatives (yielding a potentially substantial amount of revenue)
and a proposal to remove nonstandard VAT exemptions such as for petroleum products
(yielding 0.2–0.3 percent of GDP). Another proposal being considered aimed at
8

This deficit reduction is part of the administration’s plan to balance the national government
budget and reduce the public sector deficit to 1 percent of GDP by 2010.

9

The authorities did, however, raise duties on oil and petroleum imports by Executive Order
from 3 to 5 percent from January 1, 2005, which is expected to yield annual revenue of
0.1 percent of GDP.

- 11 -

consolidating many different investment incentives into a single law, but potentially could
result in a net expansion of incentives. The authorities acknowledged that the draft bill for
this proposal contained some new incentives, but noted that it would also place a 20-year
limit on incentives that were currently open-ended.
17.
Staff raised concerns about other tax measures under consideration. As in the
past, staff opposed the proposed tax amnesty because of the likely adverse effects on
compliance, and expressed doubts about whether the scheme to improve incentives for
revenue collectors would yield significant revenue benefits. Staff also voiced concerns that
the proposed franchise tax on telecom companies might be introduced in conjunction with a
VAT exemption for the industry, thus preventing commercial users of telecom services from
claiming VAT credits and breaking the VAT chain. However, this proposal has been set
aside for the time being, as has the earlier proposal to introduce a Gross Income Tax.
18.
The authorities are proceeding with civil service reform. An executive order
issued in October 2004 ordered public agencies to prepare rationalization plans. Personnel in
positions designated as redundant will have the option to either avail of severance payments
or be re-assigned. Preliminary estimates indicated that perhaps 2–4 percent of public
employees would be affected, with severance payments costing 0.1–0.3 percent of GDP.
While supporting the authorities’ goal of improving public service delivery, staff argued that
awarding generous severance payments to those already near retirement would reduce the
possible gains to the budget. The authorities agreed that some additional limitations on
severance benefits were needed and were working with the World Bank on the specifics.
19.
Strengthening public pension funds was another priority. The pension funds are
currently running small cash surpluses. However, weak asset management, high benefit
replacement rates, and insufficient contribution rates could cause pension funds to be
depleted as early as 2015. Reform of the pension funds was therefore essential to avoid
aggravating the long-term outlook for public finances. The authorities agreed on the need to
address this issue and have established a working group to consider reform options.
B. Power Sector
20.
The Philippines has launched an ambitious program of power sector reform. The
Electric Power Industry Reform Act (EPIRA) of 2001 aims at restructuring the electricity
market and privatizing power sector assets so as to encourage greater competition and attract
private investment. However, up until recent months, the reform program has been stalled,
with pro-consumer tariff decisions undermining the financial viability of NPC, and
privatization biddings for the transmission company, Transco, failing on two occasions.

- 12 -

21.
Progress with strengthening NPC’s financial position has recently been more
encouraging. NPC was granted a provisional P 0.98 per kWh average tariff increase by the
Energy Regulatory Commission (ERC) in September.10 The tariff increase is estimated to

Privatization of power sector assets, however, continues to proceed slowly. In
October, the authorities terminated bilateral negotiations with potential investors for the
Transco concession, and announced a reopening of competitive bidding. Staff expressed
concern that this change in the privatization strategy might send the wrong signal to
investors. The authorities explained that they remained firmly committed to privatizing
Transco, but had recognized that competitive bidding, even though it had failed once before,
would be more transparent. The authorities also aim to privatize 70 percent of generation
assets by end-2005, which, together with the introduction of the wholesale spot market
(expected in mid-2006), will pave the way for the launch of a competitive electricity market.
To date, the privatization of one large and five small power plants (in total worth about
$570 million) has been announced. The authorities indicated that under EPIRA, privatization
proceeds would have to be used to retire power sector debt.
23.
Strengthening the regulatory environment is also key to the success of power
sector reform. Staff welcomed the transparent manner in which the ERC had conducted the
process of awarding NPC a tariff increase. Other positive regulatory steps included the
ERC’s review of the generation rate adjustment mechanism for distribution utilities to allow
them more timely cost recovery. Cross subsidies among consumer classes are also being
phased out to improve efficiency in electricity consumption. More generally, the authorities
agreed that a rules-based regulatory framework would facilitate privatization and help to
ensure adequate investment in new power supply capacity.

10

The tariff award remains provisional until the ERC makes a final ruling on recent
objections raised by consumer groups, who thereafter could appeal to the courts.

C. Monetary Policy
24.
The BSP emphasized the role that supply factors had played in increasing
inflation. The jump in inflation had been driven by supply side factors for which monetary
policy was not the appropriate policy response. The BSP had instead called for administrative
measures to ease supply bottlenecks in importation and distribution. The authorities also
noted that the oil shock had had a relatively large effect in the Philippines because there was
no attempt to use subsidies or other measures to reduce the pass through of international oil
prices to domestic inflation.
25.
The authorities’ view was that the stage for tightening policy had not yet been
reached. To strengthen the transparency of the inflation targeting framework, the BSP had
announced the criteria it would use to decide the need for a monetary policy response. These
included inflation pressures over and above those generated by supply shocks; emerging
demand side pressures on inflation; and the risk of prolonged exchange market pressure. The
BSP’s judgment was that, as yet, none of these criteria had been clearly met. They considered
the evidence for second round effects of supply side shocks to be weak. They also noted that
the increase in core inflation was likely to be temporary. On the demand side, they noted that
although consumption was growing rapidly, growth of private credit remained moderate. In
any case, high unemployment and the absence of wage pressures were suggestive of
continued slack in the economy.
82
10
26.
Staff argued that the balance of
risks suggested a need for policy tightening.
In the staff’s assessment, the increase in
several measures of core inflation was
suggestive of initial price pressure spreading
to other sectors. In addition, the level of core
inflation remained well above the BSP’s
target range and about a third of the increase
in the headline inflation rate since end-2003
was due to factors other than identifiable
supply side factors. Indicators of demand side
pressure and slack also suggested that the
situation might be turning. In this context,
staff noted that capacity utilization was rising,
and although this was a short time series (only
recently having begun to be compiled), it had
tended to co-move with inflation in the past.
Also, while credit growth remained low, it
had decoupled from GDP growth in recent
years.

Staff also noted that continued high inflation, even if entirely supply-driven,
might affect inflationary expectations. Inflation promised to remain above the target at
least until 2006 and the recent upward shift in the yield curve was suggestive of higher
inflationary expectations for longer periods. Moreover, concerns about the macroeconomic

- 14 -

framework remain paramount in the minds of market participants, given the overriding fiscal
problem. In this light, a rate increase would send a positive signal about the BSP’s
commitment to the inflation target. The authorities observed that bond markets were illiquid
at longer tenors and downplayed the information content of the yield curve. Nonetheless,
they were paying close attention to the risk of a deterioration in inflation expectations.
D. Financial Sector Policy
28.
Staff welcomed the priority being given to financial sector reform. Revised
frameworks for supervisory enforcement and corporate debt restructuring were being
proposed that would do much to improve the resilience of the financial system. Clear rules
regarding the trust funds business had been established that were expected to increase
transparency and confidence in the system, while efforts had also been made to enhance the
internal credit risk rating systems of banks. In addition, the authorities were appropriately
emphasizing domestic capital market development to provide alternate forms of finance for
the private and public sectors.
29.
Concerns about banking system capitalization add urgency to these reforms.
Previous staff analysis has indicated that deficiencies in accounting and loan classification
practices cause capital adequacy to be overstated in the Philippines, and particularly so for
certain banks. Financial markets share these concerns; a number of large banks were recently
downgraded by an international rating agency because of the latent losses on their
nonperforming assets (NPAs). In addition, the large assistance that continues to be provided
by the Philippines Deposit Insurance Corporation (PDIC) to several banks raises further
questions about the capacity of these banks to absorb losses.
30.
While the SPV framework is gaining some traction, more pressure needs to be
exerted on banks to raise fresh capital. A number of transactions have been concluded or
are near conclusion, resulting in the likely disposal of P 30 billion in NPAs out of a total
stock of roughly P 500 billion. The authorities expressed optimism about several other deals
that were in the pipeline. Nonetheless, staff pointed out that the asset disposal process has
moved slowly so far and that more pressure needed to be exerted on banks to recognize latent
losses and inject fresh capital. The authorities concurred, but noted that major progress with
the NPA resolution strategy would first require strengthening the powers of bank supervisors.
31.
The proposed amendments to the BSP Charter are therefore fundamental to
strengthening the banking system. Pressuring owners to inject fresh capital requires
providing bank supervisors with adequate legal protection, and enhancing the prompt
corrective action and bank resolution frameworks, so that the threat of intervention becomes
credible. Staff were encouraged to see changes along these lines in the proposed amendments
to the BSP Charter, and the authorities were hopeful the legislators would respond more
positively to such amendments than they had done in the past.
32.
Current macroeconomic uncertainties further underscore the need for adequate
capital buffers. Both regular bank units and foreign currency deposit units (FCDUs) have

- 15 -

large exposure to government securities. These exposures are long-term and fixed-rate,
which creates a potential vulnerability should rates rise.11 Staff encouraged the BSP to
strengthen its monitoring of interest-rate risks, which provide a further need for banks to
increase their capital. The authorities considered interest rate risks to be manageable at this
juncture, but acknowledged the need for further enhancing data collection efforts in this area.
E. Medium-Term Outlook
33.
Over the medium term, economic reforms are necessary to invigorate growth.
While agriculture and services have been buoyant in recent years, industry has shown less
vigor with manufacturers facing fierce competition from within the region. In the staff’s
view, however, competitiveness, as measured by the real effective exchange rate, is not the
major obstacle to growth. Instead, a take-off in activity will likely require strong fiscal and
structural reforms to improve the business climate (Box 2), thereby increasing investment,

1/ Fighting target is to achieve investment-to-GDP ratio of 28 percent in 2 years.
2/ Consolidated Public Sector Deficit.

Based on a stress testing exercise, staff calculate that an interest rate shock of 300 basis
points could reduce the capital adequacy ratio of a sample of 11 large banks, currently
13½ percent, by as much as 3 percentage points if all securities were marked to market.

- 16 -

momentum is not only slower, but dissipates by the middle of the administration’s term—
growth of about 4 percent is more likely. Under the strong reform scenario, the authorities
would achieve their balanced budget objectives by 2010, and nonfinancial public sector debt
would fall to 73 percent of GDP, which while still relatively high is almost 30 percentage
points lower than the present level (Table 6). By contrast, under a moderate reform scenario,
the NFPS deficit would fall no lower than 4 percent of GDP, and while debt would edge
down, vulnerabilities would remain high (Table 7 and Annex I).
35.
The case for reform might resonate with a wider audience in the Philippines if
presented in terms of improved social outcomes. It was suggested during the August 2004
PPM Board discussion that political and public support for strong reforms might be enhanced
by presenting the benefits in terms of tangible indicators such as employment creation and
poverty reduction. Staff made a presentation to the authorities along these lines (Box 3). Of
particular note was the finding that GDP growth of 4–4½ percent per annum (the staff’s
moderate reform scenario) seemed insufficient to halt the upward trend in unemployment.12
Indeed, a decline in the unemployment rate was likely to require growth rates of at least
6 percent. Some simple calculations suggested that strong reforms could also imply
substantial benefits in terms of poverty reduction, as well as more room within the budget for
socially beneficial spending.
F. Other Issues
36.
While remaining committed to the multilateral trading system, the authorities
intend to pursue regional and bilateral trade agreements where appropriate.13 The
authorities recently announced that some of the major elements of a bilateral free trade
agreement (FTA) with Japan have been concluded, including phased tariff reductions for a
number of products (including some agricultural products) and the easing of restrictions on
the employment of Philippine nationals in Japan. Discussions are also taking place within the
ASEAN framework on FTAs with China and India. Staff analysis indicates that the recent
ending of the Multi-Fiber Agreement will have negative effects on the Philippines, but these
should be relatively moderate given that garments and textiles account for less than 7 percent
of total exports.
37.
The Philippines continues to be classified as noncooperative with regard to its
AML framework. The authorities noted that the AML framework, as amended in
12

Employment prospects also depend on the sectoral composition of GDP growth. Although
the agriculture sector has grown at record rates in recent years, the sector has created few
new jobs. Employment in the services sector, in contrast, has grown rapidly.

13

Even though average tariff rates are low in the Philippines, agricultural tariffs are among
the highest in the region. The Philippines also maintains a number of nontariff barriers,
including quantitative restrictions on rice imports and special tax incentives for the
automobile industry. Following a number of selective tariff increases in 2004, the average
tariff rate has increased to 7.5 percent from 6.2 percent in 2003.

- 17 -

March 2003, was now consistent with international standards. The Financial Action Task
Force would soon evaluate implementation under the revised framework, and the authorities
hoped that this would lead to the Philippines being removed from the noncooperative list.
V. STAFF APPRAISAL
38.
Progress is beginning to be made with reforms. President Arroyo’s election victory
in May 2004 provided an opportunity to implement the comprehensive program of reforms
that is so urgently needed to address the economy’s vulnerabilities and achieve public debt
sustainability. Reforms have proceeded slowly since the administration took office in July.
However, a number of recent developments, including the provisional tariff increase awarded
to NPC and the passage of the bill raising alcohol and tobacco excises, provide some
encouragement that the administration’s efforts will succeed.
39.
Nonetheless, with the major part of the reform agenda still unfinished,
vulnerabilities remain high. The favorable economic performance recorded in 2004 owes
much to the strength of foreign demand and the abundance of global liquidity. These
conditions are not guaranteed to continue in 2005, particularly if oil prices were to spike up
again or if the ongoing correction to the U.S. dollar were to become disorderly. Even with
benign global conditions, the Philippines could find it difficult to meet its large external
borrowing needs should the reform momentum falter.
40.
Fiscal consolidation efforts are welcome, but should be front-loaded. Despite tight
controls over expenditure, only limited progress was achieved in 2004 toward the
administration’s goals of cutting the public sector deficit to 1 percent of GDP by 2010 (while
balancing the national government budget). Nonetheless, the authorities deserve credit for
not attempting to limit the domestic pass through of higher global oil prices in 2004 since the
fiscal costs would not have been affordable. For 2005, staff recommend a reduction in the
NFPS deficit of about 2 percentage points of GDP. This would send a strong signal to
markets about the commitment to tackling the fiscal problem, while recognizing that fiscal
measures will only become more difficult as the term of the administration progresses.
41.
However, the prospects for front-loaded fiscal adjustment remain uncertain. The
NFPS deficit is expected to decline to about 4½ percent of GDP in 2005, reflecting the
targeted cut in the national government deficit and lower NPC losses as a result of the higher
electricity tariff. This is a reduction of about 1 percentage point of GDP over 2004, but
assumes a further squeezing of government spending that may not be sustainable. On the
other hand, this projection does not incorporate revenue from the various tax measures that
are still being considered. A substantial revenue yield from these measures is therefore
essential. This would allow additional spending in priority areas and the more aggressive
deficit reduction recommended by staff.
42.
High quality tax measures should therefore be the first priority. To date, only one
tax measure with a clear revenue impact has been passed by Congress. Staff look forward to
the passage of more substantive revenue-raising measures in the first few months of 2005. In
this context, staff welcome the favorable consideration being given to the higher VAT rate.
The repeal of special tax exemptions, such as the VAT exemption of petroleum, also

- 18 -

represent an important potential source of revenue. Further steps should also be taken to
improve tax administration such as improved audit strategies and increased prosecution of
evaders.
43.
Durable fiscal consolidation will also require restructuring government and
strengthening the pension schemes. The authorities are making commendable efforts to
reform the civil service and improve the delivery of services, but will need to ensure that the
severance packages paid are not overly generous. Staff also look forward to the development
of reforms that will place public pensions on a sustainable footing.
44.
Progress has been made with power sector reforms, but much more remains to
be done. The significant increase in NPC’s generation tariffs provisionally awarded in
September is an important step forward, as is the recently announced sale of a large power
plant. The government is attaching high priority to power sector privatization and plans to
sell the transmission assets as soon as possible and the majority of generation assets by the
end of 2005. It will also be important to build a track record of adherence to a predictable
rules-based energy regulatory framework so as to improve the investment climate.
45.
The case for tightening monetary policy continues to build. Although supply
shocks are the root cause of the inflation target having been missed in 2004, there are a
number of signs that price pressures have spread. Moreover, the persistence of above-target
inflation for a prolonged period, which seems likely, invites an upward revision to
inflationary expectations. While the BSP continues to weigh the evidence for inflation having
become more generalized, the staff’s view is that the balance has tipped, and that an increase
in rates is required to guide inflationary expectations down. The BSP has also clearly
communicated to the public that its policy will be guided by its inflation objective, and that it
will not attempt to defend any particular level of the exchange rate. Staff welcomes this
commitment to continuing to manage the exchange rate flexibly.
46.
Major challenges lie ahead in the financial sector. Banks are beginning to use the
special purpose vehicle framework to dispose of nonperforming assets, while amendments to
the BSP Charter, critical for strengthening bank supervision, have been submitted to
Congress. Steps have also been taken to strengthen the regulation of the banks’ trust
operations. By facilitating the consolidation and recapitalization of the banking system, these
measures will reduce existing vulnerabilities and enable the banking system to fully
contribute to economic growth. However, attempts to empower bank supervisors have
repeatedly failed in the past, and it remains to be seen whether the current amendments will
be accepted.
47.
The authorities are making welcome efforts to strengthen statistics. Staff look
forward to further implementation of the recommendations of recent Fund technical
assistance on balance of payments and public debt statistics.
48.
It is recommended that the next Article IV Consultation with the Philippines be
held on the standard 12-month cycle.

- 19 -

Box 1. The Political Economy of Fiscal Reforms in the Philippines
The Philippines’ current fiscal problems can be attributed both to tax policy changes and, until recently,
weakening tax administration, but the more fundamental factors are argued to be political. When President
Arroyo declared on August 23, 2004, that the country was in the midst of a fiscal crisis, her comments were
interpreted as an effort to generate the needed political will among congressmen to reverse the revenue decline.
Several local analysts—including a widely publicized paper by 11 economists from the University of Philippines
School of Economics—have described a declining political will to tackle pervasive corruption. The authors argued
that the costs of national debt are broad-based and not felt directly by individuals or particular interest groups,
which otherwise might have pressured their elected representatives into action. They emphasized that in such a
situation the President has to convince congress members to place the national good above that of their particular
constituencies and undertake the needed painful measures.
A recent and rapidly growing literature in economics has examined the role of political economy factors in
explaining fiscal outcomes. One recurring theme

Box 2. Assessing the Investment Climate in the Philippines
The growth performance of the Philippines has lagged
behind other Asian countries. Average growth in the
Philippines in 1999-2003 was four percent, which is 1–
4 percentage points lower than in the selected Asian
developing countries shown in the charts. The
Philippines’ relatively lower growth performance appears
to be at least partly explained by lower capital formation.

recognizes that the Philippines faces weaknesses
regarding macroeconomic and fiscal instability,
corruption, excessive bureaucracy and regulation, and

number of measures to address these weaknesses,
including balancing the budget by 2010, addressing
corruption and simplifying business procedures, and
introducing more flexibility in the Labor Code.

Box 3. Benefits of Reform
In past analysis, staff have framed the benefits of up-front fiscal consolidation and strong
reforms in terms of faster GDP growth and better debt dynamics. For example, staff projections
for the Philippines are that under current policies, which constitute a moderate-reform scenario, GDP
growth will trend down towards 4 percent over the medium term, reducing the nonfinancial public
sector debt to 93 percent of GDP. Alternatively, if the government manages to improve the
investment climate through needed reforms and is successful in balancing the budget by 2010,
growth could accelerate to 6 percent. As a result, public debt would decline to about 73 percent of
GDP. However, spelling out the benefits of reform in terms of social outcomes or outlays may
resonate better with the public and help to build a broader constituency for reform.

Strong reforms would create an additional 1.7 million jobs. Staff estimates indicate that faster
growth under the strong-reform scenario would create 1.7 million additional jobs by 2010, reversing
the rising trend in unemployment and bringing it back to below 11 percent. This assumes a labor
force growing at 3.5 percent per year and an elasticity of job creation of 0.7, in line with historical
averages.
Faster growth would raise average
incomes and move an additional 2 million
people out of poverty. Assuming population
growth of 2 percent a year, average income
would be US$170 higher in real terms
by 2010 under the strong-reform scenario.
Based on the 2000 Family Income and
Expenditure survey and assuming no change
in the income distribution, this improvement
in average incomes would move two million
additional people currently living under
US$2 a day out of poverty.

could be reversed. Higher revenue under the strong-reform scenario would provide resources for
P 130 billion in additional public spending by 2010 without compromising the government’s fiscal
consolidation targets. This would allow, for instance, the recruitment of an additional 200,000
teachers and 20,000 health workers, an increase in infrastructure spending of 40 percent, and the
purchase of an extra 15 million textbooks every year.

- 26 Table 1. Status of Revenue Measures Proposed by New Administration
Measure

Status

Yield 1/

Description/Staff View

Higher alcohol and
tobacco excises

Signed into law in
December 2004

0.2

The rates of increase vary by product but, on average, imply
roughly a 10 percent increase in retail prices. There is no
automatic indexation, but the excises will be increased by 6–
8 percent every two years until 2011. Staff support higher excises
but also argued for indexation.

Incentives for tax
administrators

Signed into law in
January 2005

Unclear

Allows tax and customs administrators to keep a percentage of
revenue in excess of target (although the Bureau of Internal
Revenue can already keep 5 percent of its excess revenue). Staff
expressed concern that this measure might promote an excessive
focus on revenue collection at the expense of other desirable
objectives (speedy processing of returns, fair administration of
tax laws, etc.). The authorities responded that such concerns
could be addressed through the operational indicators specified
in the implementing regulations.

Higher oil import tariff

Adopted by
Executive Order;
starting
January 2005

0.1

Increases the oil import tariff on petroleum from 3 to 5 percent.
Staff support higher taxes on petroleum but would have preferred
higher excises to higher tariffs.

Tax amnesty

Approved by
House; some
opposition in Senate

Small short-term
gain; possible longterm loss

Forgives all taxes from 2003 and prior years in exchange for
payment of 3 percent of net worth plus 25 percent of tax due
(excluding interest and penalties) from existing final assessments
or cases pending in court. Staff oppose, arguing that repeated
amnesties hurt taxpayer compliance.

Higher VAT rate

Approved by
House; in
committee in Senate

0.5

Raises the VAT rate from 10 to 12 percent. Staff strongly
support a higher rate for the VAT, which is moderately
progressive given the exemption of small businesses and
unprocessed food (disproportionately consumed by low-income
households).

Repeal of some VAT
exemptions

Approved out of
committee in
House; in
committee in Senate

0.2–0.3

Staff support this measure, which repeals several nonstandard
VAT exemptions, including petroleum.

Consolidation of fiscal
incentives

Approved by
House; in
committee in Senate

Direction unclear;
modest impact
either way.

Staff support goals of consolidating different fiscal incentives
into a single, more transparent law and repealing small incentives
embodied in 19 different laws. However, the House version of
the bill does not significantly reduce the largest incentives (e.g.
tax holidays for exporters and exemptions for cooperatives) and
may even result in a net expansion of incentives.

Simplified net income
tax for businesses

Has not yet
garnered significant
support in Congress

Unclear

Disallows some normally deductible business expenses, such as
those for administration, and would cut the corporate tax rate
from 32 to 28 percent. Staff oppose on the grounds that will
increase distortions and complicate administration.

Higher petroleum
excises

Set aside for now

0.4–0.5

Staff support raising petroleum excises, which are low by
international standards. This translates into roughly a 10 percent
increase in retail prices, but the poor would be shielded due to
small or no increases on kerosene and liquefied petroleum gas.

Telecommunications tax

Set aside for now

0.2

Replaces the VAT on telecommunications companies with a
7 percent turnover tax. Staff oppose, since it would likely
increase distortions. Spectrum fees should be increased instead.

Proposed Moderate
Prog.
Prel. Budget Reform 1/

Sources: Philippine authorities; and Fund staff projections.
1/ Unlike the proposed budget, this scenario incorporates the effects of higher alcohol and tobacco excises, the higher oil import
tariff, and the assumption of P 200 billion in NPC's debt. It is assumed that the latter will mainly reduce national government interest
income rather than increase interest expense, since the vast majority of the assumed debt was owed to the national government.
2/ Excludes purchase of NPC securities and other onlending.
3/ Includes privatization receipts as revenue and excludes the operations of the Central Bank-Board of Liquidators (CB-BOL).
4/ Excludes privatization receipts from revenue.
5/ Consolidated (net of national government debt held by the sinking fund) and excludes contingent/guaranteed debt.
6/ Nonfinancial public sector includes the national government, CB-BOL, 14 monitored government-owned enterprises, social security
institutions, and local governments. Debt is consolidated (net of intra-nonfinancial public sector holdings of debt). Data on local
government debt are not available for 2001; it is assumed that these debts were the same as a share of GDP as in 2002.
7/ Defined as the deficit, plus amortization of medium- and long-term debt, plus the stock of short-term debt at the end of the last
period, plus market financing on behalf of NPC.

ANNEX I

PHILIPPINES: DEBT SUSTAINABILITY ANALYSIS
The sustainability of the Philippines’ nonfinancial public sector (NFPS) debt depends
largely on the strength of future reforms (Table A1). Under a baseline scenario of
moderate reforms, debt would remain high at around 93 percent of GDP. This is predicated
on an assumed average real GDP growth of 4¼ percent over 2005–10 and a primary balance
adjustment of 1 percent of GDP in 2005–06. The recent increases in electricity rates, alcohol
and tobacco excises, and oil import tariffs, as well as tight control of spending in 2005 should
be sufficient to achieve such an adjustment. However, if policy slippages cause the primary
balance to be essentially unchanged (Alternative Scenario 2), debt would continue to climb,
assuming that this also leads to somewhat slower real GDP growth (average of 3¾ percent
over 2005–10). Conversely, strong reforms (Alternative Scenario 3) would put debt on a
firmly downward path. This scenario assumes that a stronger primary balance adjustment of
2¾ percentage points of GDP over 2005–07 (with the major part occurring in 2005) would
improve debt dynamics both directly and indirectly, assuming that improved confidence and
higher private sector investment would raise average real GDP growth to 5¼ percent.
Future shocks could adversely affect debt dynamics. Under the moderate reforms
scenario, the Bounds Tests indicate considerable sensitivity of the projected debt ratio to
shocks, especially to the exchange rate and growth. In contrast, debt dynamics would be
more resilient if strong and front-loaded reforms were adopted.
Strong front-loaded fiscal consolidation would also facilitate a more rapid reduction in
external vulnerability. Under the baseline scenario involving moderate reforms
external debt would decline gradually to about 62 percent of GDP by 2010 (Table A2),
broadly consistent with what could be expected if key macroeconomic variables remained at
their historical averages from 2005–10 (Alternative Scenario A1). However, gross external
financing requirements would continue to increase, both in US$ terms and relative to GDP,
in part due to a declining projected current account surplus. The external debt position would
also remain highly sensitive to exchange rate shocks (Bounds Tests 3 and 6) as well as a
deterioration in the current account balance (Bounds Test 4). A more ambitious reform
agenda (Alternative Scenario A2), involving front-loaded fiscal consolidation, would
facilitate a more rapid decline in external debt. A recovery in foreign direct investment and
equity inflows, and relatively lower interest rates, would enable the government to reduce its
external borrowing while still maintaining an adequate level of reserves. This would enable
external debt to fall to 51 percent of GDP by 2010.

Real interest rate is at baseline plus two standard deviations in 2005 and 2006
Real GDP growth is at baseline minus two standard deviations in 2005 and 2006
Primary balance is at baseline minus two standard deviations in 2005 and 2006
Combination of B2-B3 using one standard deviation shocks
One time 30 percent real depreciation in 2005 6/
10 percent of GDP increase in other debt-creating flows in 2005

intra-nonfinancial public sector holdings of debt). Data on local government debt are not available for 2001; it is assumed that these debts were the same as a share of GDP as in 2002.
2/ Revenue is the sum of all nonfinancial public sector revenue net of intra-public sector payments. It is assumed that 80 percent of Bureau of Treasury revenue represents interest and dividends from other
parts of the nonfinancial public sector.

Banking Sector Reforms
• Strengthen measures to address
money laundering activities

Developments
•

•

•

•
•

The Anti-Money Laundering Act (AMLA) or
Republic Act (RA) No. 9160 was approved in
September 2001. The law created the AntiMoney Laundering Council (AMLC) and the
Implementing Rules and Regulations (IRR) was
signed in April 2002.
On 7 March 2003, the law amending the AMLA
(RA No. 9194) was signed by the President. The
amendments, which seek to strengthen the
existing anti-money laundering regime and align
them with international best practice, include the
following: 1) lowering the threshold for covered
transactions from P 4.0 million to P 500,000; 2)
authorizing the BSP to inquire or examine
deposits or investment with any banking
institution without court order in the course of a
periodic or special examination; and
3) removing the provision prohibiting the
retroactivity of the law.
With the approval of the amended AMLA, the
Financial Action Task Force (FATF) sanctions
on noncomplying countries were not imposed on
the Philippines. The FATF noted the
Philippines’ substantial progress in money
laundering investigation and prosecution as well
as international cooperation, leading the
Philippines towards the last stage of the delisting
process.
The authorities submitted an implementation
plan to the FATF Review Group in January
2004.
The BSP issued policy guidelines (Circular No.
436 dated 18 June 2004) requiring banks to
incorporate minimum prescribed guidelines
related to banking transactions and electronic
fund transfers in their standard operating
procedures manual and wider anti-money

laundering program for compliance.
The BSP incorporated the Revised IRR of the
amended AMLA in the 2003 Manual of
Regulations of Banks and Non-bank Financial
Institutions to effectively carry out the fight
against money laundering (Circular No. 451
dated September 2004).
A draft bill is currently pending at the
Committee of Banks, Financial Institutions and
Currencies that seeks to amend section 2 of
“The Secrecy of Bank Deposits Law” or RA No.
1405. The bill seeks to exempt government
officials and employees from the prohibition
against disclosure of or inquiry into deposits
with any banking institutions. (As of 24 August
2004).
The BSP required banks to report their accounts
on a consolidated basis starting September 2001,
but weaknesses in the reporting framework
complicates supervision on a consolidated basis.
The BSP issued amendments to its risk-based
capital framework to incorporate market risk
(March 2004) and expand coverage to include
quasi-banks (September 2003).
The BSP issued guidelines on the capital
treatment of credit-linked notes and similar
credit derivative products (January 2004).
The BSP issued rules and regulations governing
the use of banks’ internal credit risk rating
systems to ensure that banks’ credit risk
management processes are sound and effective.
According to the rules, all universal and
commercial banks must have in place a formal
internal credit risk rating system for the
underwriting and ongoing administration,
initially, of corporate credit exposures (Circular
No. 439 dated July 5, 2004).
Thrift banks which are authorized to operate and

are actually operating Foreign Currency Deposit
Units (FCDUs) are given two years from
March 7, 2002 within which to comply with the
minimum capital requirement for FCDUs. This
requirement can be substituted by a capital
build-up program for a period of not more than
five years or only up to December 31, 2007,
subject to approval by the Monetary Board
(Circular No. 449 dated September 6, 2004)

•

Tighten provisioning requirements
and regulatory oversight

•

•

•

Starting October 1997, general loan loss
provisions were required over and above
existing provisioning requirements for classified
accounts. Provisioning requirements were
rationalized with further differentiation
depending on security, risk and status.
The BSP has issued regulations regarding the
management of large exposures, credit risk
concentrations, single borrower’s limits,
connected and/or related party transactions, and
other governance-related measures.
With regard to foreclosed assets, banks are
required to reappraise values every two years
beginning January 2002. Provisioning levels,
however, remain low.

•

Level the playing field between
foreign currency and peso
intermediation

•

Regulatory issuances also included guidelines
on the conversion and transfer of foreign
currency-denominated loans, and foreclosed
assets on the books of FCDUs/EFCDUs to peso
loans and foreclosed assets on the books of
regular banking unit.

•

Deal effectively with problem
banks

•

The General Banking Act of 2000 increased the
BSP’s capacity to take prompt corrective action.
In July 2004, the Philippine Deposit Insurance
Company’s (PDIC) charter was amended to
strengthen its ability to deal with problem banks.

(PNB) has made significant progress. PNB has
professionalized its management, and has
recently started to book modest profits.
Stress testing of commercial banks is being
undertaking to determine how banks would react
to various scenarios. The results of these tests
are relayed to concerned banks, who may then
be required to take remedial action. Prompt
corrective actions currently in place include
monetary penalties, assignment of resident
examiners and other non-monetary penalties.
The BSP, through its Legislative Liaison
Research Committee (LLRC) is initiating
legislative efforts to amend RA 7653 (otherwise
known as the New Central Bank Act) to further
expand and strengthen the legal protection
afforded to BSP personnel.
The Special Purpose Vehicle (SPV) Act was
passed in January 2003. The IRR of the SPV
Act was approved in March 2003. Banks and
quasi-banks have been reminded of the timelines
for availing of the tax incentives under the SPV
law.
In March 2004, the Securitization Act was
passed, providing scope for a strengthening of
the SPV framework.
The BIR issued Revenue Regulations in
connection with the SPV tax incentives in June
2004.
As of September 2004, 68 Certificates of
Eligibility (COE) have been issued by the BSP
to 18 banks, creating a scope for NonPerforming Asset (NPA) transfers totaling P 4.5
billion. Three banks have pending applications
for COEs with the BSP involving bank sale of
10.1 billion worth of NPAs. Thirty-six SPVs
have thus far registered with the Securities and
Exchange Commission (SEC), making them

eligible to acquire NPAs until April 8, 2005.
Availment of incentives under the SPV Law to
dispose of NPAs is finally gaining momentum
after a slow start.

•

Grant legal protection for the BSP
and PDIC supervisors

•

•

•

The amended PDIC Charter provides for
additional legal protection, in the form of
advance indemnification for litigation costs and
expenses for acts done in the performance of
official functions and duties, but these measures
do not grant full legal protection.
A draft bill is pending in the Committee of
Banks, Financial Institutions and Currencies,
Constitutional Amendments and the Ways and
Means that seeks to amend the New Central
Bank Act to further achieve greater autonomy
and enhance the BSP’s exercise of its regulatory
and supervisory functions.

•

A proposed bill entitled “An Act to Liberalize
the Operations of Rural Banks Amending for
that Purpose”, which seeks to amend RA No.
7353, otherwise known as the New Rural Banks
Act of 1992, is currently pending at the
committee level.

Fiscal and Governance Reforms
• Improve operations of the Bureau
of Internal Revenue (BIR)

•

Taxpayer compliance control systems were
improved and computerization program was
reinvigorated through the following measures:
1) stepped up tax compliance verification (or
“tax mapping”); 2) strengthened audit and
related enforcement programs; 3) organizational
adjustments; and 4) intensified use of third-party
information.

•

•

The government has proposed a law to 1)
harmonize all investment incentives to avoid
“double-dipping,” 2) allow preferred activities

to draw their tax incentives from one law for
administrative simplicity, and 3) focus the grant
of tax incentives to a list of activities that best
mirror the government’s development priorities.
The government has also proposed repealing
special non-investment related incentives that
have become costly, inefficient, non-transparent,
and difficult to administer and monitor.
However, the fiscal incentives bill passed by the
House would not affect the largest incentives
and may even result in a net expansion of
incentives.
The government has also proposed repealing
certain nonstandard VAT exemptions such as
for petroleum. This reform is also currently
under discussion in congress.

•

Reform financial sector taxation

•

The Documentary Stamp Tax (DST) law
rationalizing the taxation of debt and equity
instruments was signed into law under Republic
Act No. 9243 on February 17, 2004. VAT on
financial transactions and taxation of
FCDU/OBUs, which took effect in 2003, were
repealed recently by law.

•

Improve expenditure management

•

The Organizational Performance Indicator
Framework (OPIF) is being implemented as a
mechanism to enable agencies to focus on
strategic programs and projects and establish the
linkage of their programs and projects with their

departments, enabling these departments to
finalize their MFOs, align their programs and
projects and formulate outcome- based
performance indicators for these MFOs.

(APR) for FY 2004 was conducted on October
11-22, 2004. The results of the APR will
determine the overall performance of the
national government in terms of fund utilization,
revenue generation, and output
accomplishments. The results will be used as a
basis for future resource allocation decisions.
The e-Budget and other new database systems
are being rolled out in the Department of Budget
and Management’s (DBM) central offices
starting December 15, 2004. The system
automates the budget execution phase of the
government’s budget process, i.e., the
processing of budget releases, transmittal to
agencies, and preparation of accountability
reports.
Starting March 2004, agencies with
Maintenance and Other Operating Expenditure
(MOOE) budgets of P50 million and below
have been authorized to undertake the following
without need of DBM approval: 1) staffing
modifications; 2) use of savings; and 3)
realignment of savings from personal services to
MOOE/capital outlay (CO) and MOOE to CO
only to augment an existing item, project,
activity, or purpose in the agency’s budget.
These changes are intended to give these
agencies more budget flexibility. For monitoring
purposes, agencies have been required to submit
quarterly reports of budgetary actions taken.

On the implementation of the Government
Procurement Reform Act (GPRA), the following
measures are being undertaken:
• Provision of training for different agencies to
fully disseminate procurement reforms
embodied in the GPRA. As of end-December
2004, 58.4 percent of National Government
Agencies (NGAs); 40.1 percent of GOCCs;

Development of a generic procurement manual
and a set of standard bidding documents for the
use of government procurement officials and
employees. A first draft of the Procurement
Manual for Goods, Civil Works and Consulting
Services has been completed. It is due for a final
review prior to its release to procuring entities
and to pilot testing for further enhancement.
Full operationalization of the GovernmentElectronic Procurement System as the central
portal providing information on various
government procurement opportunities and
information. Presently, the G-EPS is operating
all the three features in its “Pilot Phase,”- the
Electronic Bulleting Board, the Supplier
Registry and the Electronic Catalogue.
Enhancement of the Pilot G-EPS is ongoing,
including data migration and is targeted for
implementation on the third quarter of 2005.
The full implementation of the G-EPS, which
includes features such as Virtual Store,
Electronic Bidding and Electronic Payment is
being targeted for implementation in the third
quarter of 2006.
Two bills were filed in the 13th Congress to seek
authority for the President to reorganize the
Executive Branch, subject to defined principles
and parameters. The proposed bills also offer
appropriate incentives for personnel who may be
affected by the reengineering effort. The DBM
is currently working on a refined version of the
Reengineering Bill that would authorize the
President to reengineer the executive branch and
implement massive and transformational
reforms in the bureaucracy.
While awaiting the passage of the

Reengineering Bill, the DBM together with the
Civil Service Commission (CSC), is pursuing a
rationalization program that aims to have an
immediate impact on the government’s objective
of improving public service delivery and
institutional capacity through the rationalization
of the functions and agencies of the executive
branch.
Executive Order (EO) No. 366 dated 04 October
2004 has been issued directing all departments
to conduct a strategic review of the operations
and organizations of all their component units,
including agencies and GOCCs/GFIs attached to
or under their administrative supervision. The
strategic review would enable them to identify
the functions, programs, activities, and projects
which: 1) can either be scaled down, phased out,
or abolished; or 2) where more resources need to
be channeled. Each department is required to
prepare a Rationalization Plan.
Personnel who may be affected by the program
would be given two options: 1) remain in
government service and be placed in other
agencies needing additional personnel or 2)
avail of the retirement/separation benefits, if
qualified, plus the applicable incentive. Those
with temporary appointment attested by the CSC
may opt to remain but are guaranteed tenure up
to expiration of their appointment only. The
DBM is currently finalizing the implementing
regulations of EO 366 to guide
departments/agencies in the implementation of
said directive. The regulations would be issued
by the DBM upon finalization of the program’s
communication plan.

provides a framework for the restructuring of
the power sector, including privatization of
National Power Corporation (NPC) assets and
deregulation of the power sector.
The Power Sector Assets and Liabilities

Procedure on Corporate Rehabilitation effective
December 2000.
With its quasi-judicial powers having been
shifted to the courts, the SEC is taking steps to
minimize debt restructuring incidents by: 1)
imposing more stringent financial disclosure
requirements, including bringing accounting
system up to international standards; 2)
regulating external auditors more closely and 3)
implementing the code of corporate governance,
which applies to all corporations (domestic and
foreign) whose securities are registered or listed.
The code requires these corporations to
formulate, submit (to SEC), and adopt a Manual
of Corporate Governance. The Manuals are to
be made available to directors and subject to
inspection by stockholders, and to be adhered to
under penalty of law. The passage of the
Securitization Act in March 2004 would
facilitate restructuring by permitting asset
management companies to finance their
acquisitions of distressed assets through capital
markets and institutional investors.
Securitization can also contribute to the
development of corporate bond markets by
overcoming the problems of the small size and
low credit quality of most issuers.
The SEC, with the BSP, IC and PDIC,
established the Financial Sector Forum (FSF).
The FSF is a voluntary cooperative endeavor of
the concerned agencies to provide an
institutionalized framework for coordinating
supervision and regulation, while preserving
each agency’s mandate. The FSF will focus on
the following three broad areas:
1) harmonization and coordination of
supervisory and regulatory methods and
policies, identification and filling in of gaps and
elimination of overlapping functions in the
current supervisory regime; 2) reporting and

information exchange and dissemination,
including developing comprehensive rules on

harmonizing regulatory reporting requirement to
lighten the load of supervised institutions,
creation of database linkages among the
agencies; and 3) consumer protection and
education to curb the proliferation of unlawful
and unethical business practices as well as
various financial scams.
In recognition of the need to provide a better
legal framework, with clear and transparent
rules that allows the widest possible
participation by the investing public under
proper safeguards, the Executive branch is
pushing for the passage of a house bill that
seeks to amend the Securities Regulation Code
(Republic Act No. 8799). The bill is aimed at
revising certain provisions of the Code in order
to promote a more vibrant and healthy capital
market. The pertinent provisions include, among
others: the mandatory tender offers; minimum
capital requirements; broker-director prohibition
and limitation on ownership of an exchange.
Another bill being pressed in the 13th Congress
is the Revised Investment Company Act. This
bill proposes to undertake the following: 1)
promote the application of fiduciary principles
in investments and in the management and
administration of investment companies;
2) prevent abuses and protect the interest of the
investing public; and 3) establish the Investment
Company Investors Protection Fund to
compensate investors for financial injury for
reasons other than market price decline in the
investments portfolio of the company.
The draft bill on corporate recovery was
originally submitted to Congress in 2001.

Similar house bills were filed anew in the 13th
Congress. Entitled the “Corporate Recovery
Act”, these bills are aimed at offering a
comprehensive approach to the problems faced
by enterprises when they, for whatever reason,
can no longer pay their debts as they become
due. It emphasizes on the survival of the
enterprise while at the same time keeping
paramount the rights of debtors and creditors to
initiate formal debt relief proceedings.

Steps are being taken to improve the

capabilities of the PSE. Demutualization was
completed in August 2001, transforming the
PSE into a publicly-held corporation with
diverse ownership, governed by a majority of
non-brokers, and managed by an independent
and professional group.
On 15 December 2003, PSE became a listed
corporation with its introductory listing on the
bourse.
The Rules Governing Trading of PSE Shares
became effective on 30 December 2003. The
PSE was directed by the SEC to observe
immediately the limitations set by the Securities
Regulation Code including those restricting any
industry from owning more than 20 percent of
the PSE's outstanding capital stock.
SEC approved in December 2004, PSE’s new
rules for listed companies under corporate
rehabilitation. Listed companies are required to
submit to the SEC and PSE copies of the
petition for corporate rehabilitation, documents
and proposed rehabilitation plan within 24 hours
of its actual filing with the courts. Once the
court approves the rehabilitation plan, the
company would have to submit a comprehensive
corporate disclosure on the effects of the plan on

committee to provide oversight of the
institution’s financial reporting and control and
internal and external audit functions;
2) corporate governance committee, tasked to
review and evaluate the qualifications of all
persons nominated to the board as well as those
nominated to other positions requiring
appointment by the board of directors, and
ensure the board’s effectiveness and due
observance of corporate governance principles
and guidelines. It shall oversee the periodic
performance evaluation of the board and its
committees and executive management, among
others; and 3) risk management committee to be
responsible for the development and oversight
of the institution's risk management program.

Exchange Arrangement:

The value of the Philippine peso is determined in the interbank foreign exchange market; the
Bangko Sentral intervenes in the market in order to smooth undue short-term fluctuations in
the exchange rate.
From November 1995 to June 1997 the peso was effectively fixed at around P 26.2–
P 26.4 per U.S. dollar. On July 11, 1997, the peso depreciated to P 29.45 per U.S. dollar
following an announcement by the central bank that the peso would be allowed to find its

Article IV Consultation:

The Philippines is on the standard 12-month cycle. The 2003 Article IV Consultation was
discussed by the Executive Board on March 5, 2004. At that time, Directors noted that while
the Philippines had undertaken important economic reforms in recent years, key areas of
weakness and vulnerabilities remained, in particular in the fiscal, banking, and power sectors.
Directors observed that absent comprehensive reforms, the economy’s vulnerabilities would
further increase. They, therefore, underscored the urgent need for the authorities to
implement comprehensive reforms, in order to set the economy on a high and sustainable
growth trajectory, reduce the still pervasive poverty, and improve debt sustainability and the
economy’s resilience to adverse shocks. They also urged the authorities not to loosen policies
in the pre-election environment.

PHILIPPINES: RELATIONS WITH THE WORLD BANK
A. World Bank Lending
As of December 31, 2004, the current Philippines portfolio consisted of 23 projects,
amounting to $1.16 billion (net of cancellations), of which $505 million has been disbursed.
Since the Bank started operations in the Philippines, it has committed $9.56 billion under
IBRD loans and $239 million under IDA credits (less cancellations). Based on net
commitments and by sector, the portfolio can be broken down as follows: Rural
Development (34 percent); Education, Health & Social Development (18 percent); Transport
(18 percent); Urban Development (13 percent); Energy (3 percent); Environment
(12 percent); and Governance (2 percent).
The World Bank’s current Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) for the Philippines focuses on
accelerating growth and empowering the poor to participate more fully in development. The
CAS sets forth a base case lending program of about $1.1 billion for the FY03–05 period, but
the actual volume is anticipated to be much lower due to the Government’s restraint on
borrowing as a result of its tight fiscal situation. The Bank is now in the process of
formulating a new CAS for the period FY06-08.
During FY04, the World Bank approved 4 loans for a total of $96.9 million: Judicial Reform
($21.9 million), Rural Power ($10 million), Laguna Lake Institutional Strengthening and
Community Development ($5 million) and the Diversified Farm Income and Market
Development ($60 million).
The World Bank has also been involved in non-lending activities. These activities focus
on four themes emphasized by the Bank’s current assistance strategy: ensuring effective
delivery of public services; strengthening the environment for private sector development;
building human resources; and managing natural resources, rural development, and
regional concerns. Recent examples of non-lending outputs include Education Policy
Notes, a Natural Disaster Management Study; a Natural Resource Management Study;
and Discussion Briefs to help inform the next Philippine government on the development
challenges faced by the new administration.
In addition to analytical work, the Bank also provides technical assistance to the Philippines,
frequently supported by trust funds such as the Institutional Development Fund (IDF) and the
World Bank-managed ASEM Trust Fund14. Technical assistance is being provided in such
areas as: pension reform; strengthening various institutions for good governance;
international competitiveness; strengthening public financial management capacity; city
development strategies; sustainable development in mining; and corporate governance. Also,
technical assistance funded by the Policy and Human Resource Development (PHRD) Grant

Asia-Europe Meeting—The European Union’s Asian crisis response fund, created in April 1998; intended to
help eligible East Asian countries, including the Philippines, to recover from the regional financial crisis. The

governance.

Facility helps the client prepare lending operations. Country and project specific grants were
mobilized in FY04 amounting to about $8.2 million. Our grant portfolio as of December 31,
2004 consisted of 77 active grants, totaling about US$34.4 million, of which about US$9.8
million has been disbursed. In addition, during FY04, the Bank processed grants which
would co-finance some of the new lending. These included: a $9 million GEF grant for the
Rural Power Project; a $5 million grant from the Netherlands for the Laguna Lake
Institutional Strengthening and Community Development Project; and a $12 million GEF
grant for an Electric Cooperative System Loss Reduction Project to support the Rural Power
Project.
The World Bank has an extensive outreach program in the Philippines to promote knowledge sharing.
Currently there are eight Knowledge for Development Centers (KDCs) around the country that make
available Bank publications and development literature either through on-line access or through hard
copies. The Bank has also partnered with the Asian Institute of Management (AIM) to create a Global
Distance Learning Network that offers distance learning sessions for a broad national, regional, and
international audience. In addition, the Bank also maintains an external country website
(www.worldbank.org.ph).

PHILIPPINES: RELATIONS WITH THE ASIAN DEVELOPMENT BANK
Since joining the Asian Development Bank (ADB) in 1966, the Philippines has received 192
loans for a total of $8.62 billion, and 311 technical assistance grants amounting to
$137 million. Forty-eight percent of the loans were for projects in the energy and agriculture
sectors. In 2004, two loans for the health sector development program were approved totaling
$213 million. Ten technical assistance grants totaling $5.995 million were also approved in
2004.
ADB’s private sector operations, which are made without government guarantee, amounted
to $509.5 million, including 15 loans of $474.3 million and 18 equity investments of
$35.2 million. The Philippines is one of the largest clients for such activities.

ANNEX VI

PHILIPPINES: STATISTICAL ISSUES
Although data are generally published on a timely basis, weaknesses in the Philippines’
statistical base continue to hamper macroeconomic analysis. Data Module of the Report
on the Observance of Standards and Codes (ROSC) noted that the most serious deficiencies
relate to the national accounts and balance of payments statistics.
The Philippines has subscribed to the Special Data Dissemination Standards (SDDS) and its
metadata are posted on the Dissemination Standards Bulletin Board (DSBB).
D. National Accounts
Despite the authorities’ efforts to improve its quality, there are serious weaknesses in
the national accounts. The problems are shown by large discrepancies between GDP
estimated from the expenditure side and GDP from the production side (the official GDP
estimates). The growth of GDP often shows contradictory movements between the
expenditure and production sides, with the difference of the growth rates about 3 percent on
average over the last two years.
The ROSC identified a number of causes for these problems15.
•

Deaths and births of establishments are not adequately measured, a gap of growing
importance given the rapid structural change in the economy in recent years.
Annual surveys are designed to pick up these changes but the latest data are from
the 1998 National Statistical Office (NSO) annual survey of establishments. This implies
that a large number of new establishments, in particular in the electronics and information
technology industry, are not covered in the national accounts.

•

The compilation relies on an outdated benchmark year and fixed input-output
ratios. The estimates are derived by extrapolation of the 1988 benchmark year using
fixed input-output ratios at 1985 prices. For example, GDP statistics for the electronic
sector suggest that value added remained at 10 percent of exports over the past years in
spite of industry evidence that the domestic component of exports has been rising
sharply. A new benchmark I-0 constructed by the NSCB is scheduled to be released in
September 2005.16

•

Statistical techniques in estimating GDP at constant prices are inadequate. For most
activities, not all components of the production accounts are compiled. Instead, only

15

Currently, the authorities are compiling new national accounts series based on the 1993
SNA guidelines.
16

Industry representatives indicate that the domestic component has increased significantly,
to around 30 percent in recent years.

- 60 -

ANNEX VI

value added at current prices is estimated, with the corresponding value added at constant
prices estimated using a price deflator. For example, the national accounts constant price
estimates for merchandise exports and imports are constructed at 1985 unit values (per
kilo) multiplied with quantity data (in kilos) from the foreign trade statistics. Because of
this inappropriate method, implicit deflators for electric machinery products are running
suspiciously high compared with developments in world market prices.
E. Balance of Payments
Steps have been taken to improve the quality of the balance of payments accounts
although significant weaknesses remain. The Fund has remained actively engaged in
attempts to address this issue, with several balance of payments statistics technical assistance
missions to the Philippines since 1995. There has been important progress over the past year,
with a significant improvement in the measurement of imports to correct an underestimation
of imports of electronic goods on a consignment basis. Nevertheless, errors and omissions
remain sizable as a result of remaining reporting gaps and misclassifications, which make the
data very difficult to interpret.17 Data for external debt and reserves, on the other hand, are
generally of good quality, although the data ROSC mission identified some weaknesses in
these accounts.
Recent revisions to imports have narrowed the gap between national trade data and
those of partner countries on a net basis. An interagency task force on import statistics was
established in July 2002 to improve the measurement of activity in the electronics sector,
which accounts for about 43 percent of trade flows. Results of surveys covering electronics
sector raw material imports confirmed that imports were being routinely underestimated.
Import figures have therefore been revised substantially, back to 2000.18 As a result, the
estimated trade balance for 2001 changed from a surplus of 3.8 percent of GDP to a deficit of
1 percent of GDP. A comparison of the revised figures with trade data of partner countries
suggests that the revised trade balances of 2001–02 are being reasonably well measured.
However, there remain substantial differences with partner country data on gross flows of
exports and imports, with the latter about 15 percent higher than the corresponding national
data.
The ROSC data module confirmed that significant problems remain, both in terms of
gaps in coverage and compilation of statistics:
17

Errors and omissions and “trade credits” accounted for balance of payments outflows of
US$4.4 billion (5.6 percent of GDP) in 2002. Trade credit data in the Philippines, which are
calculated as the difference between export receivables (export shipments less export
receipts) and import payables (import arrivals less import payments), are unreliable, as
indicated by the continued accumulation of trade credit balances. They are therefore grouped
with errors and omissions in the IMF presentation of the Philippines balance of payments
accounts.
18

Data from 1996–99 have not been revised and remain underestimated.

ANNEX VI

•

Since deregulation in the early 1990s, international transactions have increasingly
flowed through nontraditional channels that are not adequately covered by the
statistical reporting system. The major gap relates to Foreign Currency Deposit Units
(FCDUs), which account for about 70–75 percent of foreign exchange settlements,
where because of strict secrecy rules banks are not mandated to report information. A
number of steps are being taken to measure cross-border transactions that skirt the
domestic banking system, such as flows through inter-company accounts.19 A number
of enterprise surveys, for example, have been introduced. However, these are
conducted on a voluntary basis and will take time to implement fully. If the secrecy
rules associated with FCDU accounts are not modified to facilitate the collection of
data for statistical purposes, the quality of the balance of payments is likely to remain
poor for some time.

•

These problems have been compounded by a lack of resources devoted to the
compilation of balance of payments statistics. The time that compilers (at the BSP)
can devote to making full use of readily available data , or developing improved
sources and methods, has been squeezed by noncompilation related tasks. As a result,
progress in implementing the recommendations of various IMF technical assistance
missions has been slow. With these concerns in mind, the periodicity of the release of
balance of payments statistics has been switched from monthly to quarterly (effective
with the release of third quarter data for 2003 in December 2003) and a decision
made to establish a separate Department of Economic Statistics within the BSP.
F. Monetary Accounts

While the framework underlying the compilation of the monetary statistics largely
conforms to the Fund’s methodology, major structural changes in the financial system
following liberalization have affected data for the central bank, commercial banks, and
nonbank financial intermediaries.
The ROSC identified a few shortcomings in coverage and quality of the monetary
aggregates. The authorities have recently made progress on some fronts. They have
introduced the Depository Corporations Survey which now includes operations of thrift and
rural banks. They have also introduced uniform procedures for converting foreign currency
denominated accounts to local currency in the monetary aggregates. However, weakness
remain, including in the areas of treatment of non-operational banks, valuation of securities,
and treatment of accrued interest in the monetary statistics aggregates. Practices in these
areas need to be brought into line with international norms.

19

According to recent household surveys, typically about 30 percent of remittances of
Overseas Filipino Workers were not channeled through the banking system, suggesting that
remittances may have been underestimated by about US$3 billion (3.8 percent of GDP) in
2002.

ANNEX VI

G. Fiscal Data
While the Philippines meets the requirements of fiscal transparency in many important
respects, the recent fiscal and data ROSCs found areas that require strengthening. An
important problem is that the budget is presented on an obligations basis, while the deficit is
reported on a cash basis, complicating comparisons of budgets and outcomes. In addition, for
levels of the public sector beyond the budgetary central (national) government, consolidated
fiscal outturns for items other than the fiscal balance are generally available. Stock and flow
information is also not generally well-reconciled.

Statement by the IMF Staff Representative
March 7, 2005
1.
This statement contains information about recent developments that has become
available since the Staff Report was circulated to the Executive Board on February 7, 2005.
This information does not alter the thrust of the staff appraisal.
2.
Financial markets have remained stable, despite Moody’s downgrading the
Philippines’ long-term sovereign ratings by 2-notches in mid-February to B1. The
ratings agency noted that some improvement in tax collections had been made, but expressed
concern about the outlook for reform as Congress grapples with politically difficult choices.
Nonetheless, markets have remained firm in 2005 to date; the peso is up by 2 percent against
the U.S. dollar, mainly as a result of increased portfolio inflows, while sovereign spreads on
the EMBI+ Philippines index have declined broadly in line with the EMBI+ Global index.
Appetite for the government’s $1.5 billion sovereign bond issue at the end of January was
strong.
3.
The budget deficit target for 2005 has been revised slightly downwards, but
Congress continues to deliberate on the tax measures that would be required for a more
front-loaded deficit reduction. The authorities have lowered their target for the 2005
national government deficit (authorities’ definition) from 3.6 to 3.4 percent of GDP to reflect
the increases in excises on alcohol and tobacco products and other measures that were
approved at the end of last year. The VAT bill passed by the House of Representatives in
January increasing the standard rate from 10 to 12 percent has met with considerable
opposition in the Senate and alternative VAT reforms such as widening the VAT base are
being considered. Indeed, the House passed a bill this week that would eliminate some VAT
exemptions, including for medical and legal services, but at the same time, introduce lower
VAT rates for other sectors.
4.
The authorities have revised up the 2005 inflation target to 5–6 percent. The
government raised the target for average inflation from the earlier 4–5 percent to reflect the
shift to the recently introduced 2000-based CPI and to factor in continuing supply-side
pressure on inflation. In 2004, inflation averaged 0.5 percentage points higher on the basis of
the new CPI than the 1994-based CPI due to changes in the components and weights in the
basket. The new CPI based inflation was 8.5 percent (y/y) in February, up 0.1 percentage
point from January, while core inflation rose slightly to 8.1 percent (y/y).
5.
The Philippines has been removed from the Financial Action Task Force’s
(FATF) list of Non-Cooperative Countries and Territories. The FATF announced on
February 11 that anti-money laundering (AML) measures were being effectively
implemented to remedy earlier identified deficiencies.
6.
New appointments to the economic team have been announced. The President has
appointed Mr. Cesar Purisima (former Secretary of Trade and Industry) as Secretary of
Finance and announced that Mr. Amando M. Tetangco, Jr. (currently Deputy Governor)

-2-

would become Governor of the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas at the end of Governor
Buenaventura’s term in July. Mr. Juan Santos has been appointed as the new Secretary of
Trade and Industry and Mr. Raphael Lotilla as the new Secretary of Energy.

Statement by Jong Nam Oh, Executive Director for the Philippines
and Cyd Amador, Senior Advisor to Executive Director
March 7, 2005
Key Points
•

While macroeconomic fundamentals remain sound, the strong implementation of
high-quality measures is needed to address underlying weaknesses, particularly in the
fiscal, power, and financial sectors.

•

Fiscal consolidation remains the top priority. Disciplined fiscal policy has started to
deliver results.

•

Decisive implementation of well thought-out structural reforms should strengthen the
prospects for medium-term growth and lead to a more participatory development
process.

Our authorities wish to record their appreciation for a well-written and candid report, which
highlights the progress made and the central policy challenges facing the economy. They
also thank the staff for their rigorous analysis on various selected issues that appropriately
focus on medium-term vulnerabilities, making a valuable contribution to the public policy
debate underway regarding the measures needed to promote high economic growth. Close
engagement between the staff and the authorities has enriched discussions on economic
policy issues and prescriptions as well as development strategies. In addition, technical
assistance from the Fund has helped in capacity building and knowledge transfer that, in turn,
have strengthened domestic ownership in policy formulation and implementation.
Macroeconomic fundamentals remain sound. Strong implementation of high-quality
measures is needed to address underlying weaknesses, particularly in the fiscal, power,
and financial sectors.
Steady growth in economic activity is due in large part to the sound policy framework, with
fiscal prudence at the front and center of the government’s economic program. Sound
macroeconomic performance is also evident in a healthy external account position, low
interest rates, and a stronger peso. The base of growth has broadened as exports and
investments have started to perk up.
While recognizing the headway made in sustaining macroeconomic stability and
consolidating growth, the authorities are well aware that long-standing vulnerabilities remain
that could undermine hard-won gains. The strong implementation of high-quality measures
is critical to narrow fiscal imbalances and addresses weaknesses in the power and financial
sectors. The Medium-Term Philippine Development Plan (2004-2010) sets out the policy
directions of the government going forward. The plan rests on four economic imperatives,
namely: macroeconomic stability anchored on medium-term fiscal consolidation to bring the

-2public debt ratios on a decisive downward trend; financial sector reform; power sector
restructuring and reform; and increased infrastructure, investments, exports and employment.
The authorities are keenly aware of the need for prompt and bold action on these fronts and
have been liaising closely with all stakeholders, including and importantly the legislators, to
advance the cause for reform.
The authorities’ explicit and strong commitment to fiscal consolidation at the very start of the
administration’s term set the tone for a determined plan to put the fiscal house in order.
Palpable steps have been taken along the path of adjustment: important tax reform measures
have been signed into law, power generation tariffs have been raised markedly, a major
power plant has been sold, and the climate for foreign investment has been boosted by a
judicial action to open up the mining industry.
Reform, however, is always work-in-progress and thus there is always unfinished business.
The country is in the middle of urgent reforms. However, any meaningful reform plan would
prosper only with public support. A critical challenge facing the authorities is to generate
political and popular acceptance and drum up support over the long haul for a reform
program to transform the economy. In this regard, the authorities have continued to raise
public awareness of the issues at stake and encouraged public discussion on the urgency of
the need for strong, united action to address pressing problems through a credible and
coherent economic program. Discussions have highlighted the gravity of the problems
confronting the economy, the dividends of strong reform and the costs of inaction and diluted
or half-hearted reform efforts. As a result, there is wide recognition of the need for
adjustment, and the public debate, especially on fiscal reform, is at a high level.
The costs of adjustments, however, needs to be considered to facilitate social and political
consensus and keep at bay resistance to staying the course. This underlies the authorities’
measured approach to reform. In striking up the tempo of reforms, they have carefully
prioritized and sequenced reform measures to avoid having an overcrowded agenda while
trying to minimize short-term economic dislocations and ensure that the burden-sharing of
adjustments is equitable. By doing this, they hope to establish broad support that will help
the reform drive gain traction and develop a sustainable momentum that over time should
strengthen the incentives for the continued adoption of good policies.
Monetary policy continues to closely guard against threats to price stability.
The authorities see near-term inflation to be influenced primarily by supply factors, the direct
effects of which cannot be addressed appropriately by monetary policy action. As in previous
episodes of supply-driven inflation, they expect inflation to revert to manageable levels and
ease back toward the target by next year. This and the absence of strong demand-side
pressures explain the authorities’ decision to keep monetary policy settings on the neutral
mode. However, the authorities remain alert to inflationary pressures and stand ready to
respond in a timely fashion to conditions that threaten price stability. They are closely
monitoring potential second-round effects of supply-side shocks, including in inflation
expectations, to ensure that these are well contained, and they are closely tracking demand
indicators as the economy shifts to higher gear. Any monetary response will be undertaken

-3promptly and at a measured pace, calibrated according to the extent of the underlying price
pressures while helping ensure the sustainability of growth.
The country’s export outlook has benefited from continued product and market
diversification. A recent court ruling opening up the mining sector to foreign investment
should help boost exports and revitalize the mining industry. Remittances from overseas
Filipino workers remain robust. A flexible exchange rate system facilitates adjustments to
external shocks and structural changes. However, the large external financing requirements
render the country vulnerable to changes in global financial market conditions. Prudent
external debt management serves as a cushion against reversals in market sentiment. The
maturity structure of the external debt helps limit financing pressures, with short–term debt
accounting for only about a tenth of total external debt, and medium- to long-term debt
maturities averaging more than 17 years. The Bangko Sentral also continues to maintain a
comfortable level of reserves to sufficiently cover short-term debt.
Fiscal consolidation remains the top priority. Adherence to a disciplined fiscal policy
framework has started to deliver results.
The large fiscal deficit has been a major drag on growth and investor confidence. Fully
cognizant of this, President Arroyo last August singled out the fiscal deficit as the economy’s
most urgent problem, generating broader public awareness of the gravity of the issue.
Of late, fiscal discipline has started to yield much-welcome results. The fiscal position was
better than expected in 2004, with the National Government (NG) deficit at 3.8 percent of
GDP compared to the target of 4.2 percent. Going forward, the cross-cutting challenge
facing the authorities is to achieve fiscal consolidation in the medium term to bring the public
debt to a more sustainable level while creating fiscal space to allow for much-needed
development expenditures, including on infrastructure, public services and social programs
that will not only provide short-term, palliative benefits to the poor but also help them
become more productive by drawing them into the economic mainstream.
Raising the revenue effort is critical if significant progress is to be made in reducing the debt
burden. An important element in this strategy is the fundamental reform of the tax structure.
Positive steps in this direction include the rise in excise taxes on liquor and cigarettes and the
enactment of the bill that seeks to ensure optimum performance in revenue collection
agencies through a system of rewards and sanctions. Other new revenue-raising measures
include the implementation of a pre-announced hike in import duties on fuel and increases in
fees charged by government agencies. The authorities continue to push for legislation that
will improve tax and revenue efforts. Tax measures in the legislative pipeline include a
proposal to raise the value added tax, the rationalization of fiscal incentives for investments,
and the elimination of a range of VAT exemptions. The authorities’ advocacy for
fundamental tax reform through a VAT increase is a strong signal of their recognition of the
need to take decisive action to address the fiscal problem.
These tax policy reform measures complement efforts underway to strengthen the efficiency
of tax administration and plug revenue leaks. The authorities also continue to rationalize and

-4prune expenditures, while taking care to protect social programs. Measures include paring
down the size of the bureaucracy, improving the management of government-owned and
controlled enterprises (GOCCs), and implementing the devolution provision of the Local
Government Code to enhance the effectiveness of public service delivery. The authorities
are pushing for a separate legislative program aimed at spending restraint, comprising a fiscal
responsibility bill, the rationalization of public pension schemes, and the removal of
automatic guarantees for GOCCs. Prudent spending is expected to provide flexibility in
raising infrastructure spending, which would help address a major hindrance to strong
investments.
The authorities’ phased-in and multi-pronged fiscal reform strategy should dispel the concern
that there is a lack of urgency or ambition in coming to grips with the fiscal problem. The
authorities recognize the need for an ambitious fiscal effort that will lead to significant deficit
reduction over the medium term. As the staff notes, the authorities “agreed that there was a
need to front load fiscal adjustment and hoped that revenue from new tax measures, which
are not included in the 2005 budget, might make this possible”. At the same time, they are
taking care against overpromising and being overambitious in adjustments, because doing so
runs the risk of overwhelming the capacity of the constituency to digest and tolerate a
multitude of major reforms, possibly leading to backsliding or the abandonment of reform
efforts. Thus far, the results speak for themselves, with the encouraging 2004 fiscal results,
putting the NG deficit ahead of schedule compared to the authorities’ initial fiscal
consolidation plan. Looking ahead, the government remains fully determined to make
progress on improving public finances, including and importantly through a meaningful
turnaround in revenue performance. Ownership of the economic program is strong.
Decisive implementation of structural reforms should strengthen the prospects for
medium-term growth and enable the development process to be more inclusive.
The authorities realize the urgent need to address stumbling blocks and structural challenges
that hinder progress. Lifting the pace of structural reform is also necessary to reduce
vulnerabilities and increase economic flexibility so that the Philippines is well-positioned to
take advantage of the opportunities presented by globalization.
A vibrant economy requires a well-functioning and dynamic financial sector, one that can
efficiently intermediate funds, manage risks, and support the requirements of strong, private
sector-led growth. Slow but nevertheless steady progress has been made by banks in
disposing of their non-performing assets (NPAs) through special purpose vehicles. Large
NPAs have acted as an enormous drag on the banking system, contributing to lackluster loan
growth and low profitability. Recently, the Bangko Sentral has made it more costly for
banks to retain NPLs and idle assets in their books with the issuance of a circular that
prescribes higher risk weights for NPLs and NPAs. This should compel banks to take more
aggressive steps to reduce their NPAs.
With a view to promoting a stronger and more stable financial system, the Bangko Sentral
continues to lobby in Congress for the passage of measures that will strengthen its
supervisory and enforcement powers, prioritizing those amendments to the Bangko Sentral

-5charter that will provide for more effective bank supervision and better legal protection of
supervisory personnel, which is a long-standing issue as noted by the staff. Other important
banking system reforms include the creation of a comprehensive and reliable credit
information system for accurate assessments of creditworthiness, and the strengthening of
corporate governance and transparency in banks. To nurture the domestic capital market, the
authorities are pushing reform aimed at encouraging more domestic savings by improving the
management of pension funds; establishing orderly and efficient securities trading and
settlement through the setting up of appropriate market infrastructure; bringing transparency
and accountability standards at par with international best practices; and coordinating and
harmonizing supervisory and regulatory practices across financial services. At the same
time, the Bangko Sentral has made it an equally important priority to broaden the access of
the poor to financial services. Through its flagship program on microfinance, appreciable
headway has been made to establish a supportive policy and regulatory environment that will
encourage banks to lend to the poor in a sustainable way.
Key to balancing the budget is the successful restructuring of the energy sector. The
government’s success in advancing energy reform will also ensure efficient and reliable
power supply and strengthen the economy’s competitiveness. In the selected issues paper,
staff helpfully recognizes the headway that has been made in this direction, calling the
reform the first major attempt among Asian developing countries to build a fully liberalized
and competitive power market. However, much remains to be done. The privatization of the
National Power Corporation (NPC) through the sale of its generation assets and the
concession of the transmission company (Transco) is among the most urgent of the
authorities’ reform efforts. It has been a laborious process but the authorities are determined
to put an end to the fiscal drain imposed by NPC. This year, the government expects to
award a concession contract to operate the Transco grid. On a positive note, the Philippines
sold its first large generation plant in December last year, in addition to five small
hydropower plants. Energy officials plan to front load the privatization of generation
companies in 2005. The government’s determination to put in place corrective fiscal
measures is also manifest in its efforts to better reflect the cost of power generation, with the
98-centavo provisional average tariff increase awarded to NPC. As a social safety net, the
same lifeline rate for small consumers remains in effect.
Sustained, respectable growth also hinges on the successful implementation of measures that
will boost competitiveness and investor confidence. The authorities intend to persist with
structural reforms that will improve the environment for private sector activity. This will
open up economic opportunities and create employment, critical for a country where more
than a tenth of its labor force is not gainfully employed. The authorities also continue to
pursue an array of reforms aimed at creating a more business-friendly environment including
reform to improve the adjudication process, simplify business procedures, and crack down on
corruption, including by improving transparency. The benefits of good governance are well
embraced by our authorities. They are pushing for measures that will improve public
governance, including strengthening anti-corruption institutions like the Anti-Graft
Commission and the Office of the Ombudsman as well as creating a data base that would
facilitate the analysis of assets and liabilities and net worth of public officials and employees.

-6Our authorities are well aware that the current favorable conditions marked by
macroeconomic stability offer a window of opportunity to press ahead decisively and boldly
with reforms that will reduce key medium-term vulnerabilities, particularly in the fiscal,
financial and energy sectors, while addressing the economy’s social challenges. Our
authorities also remain committed to pursuing sound macroeconomic policies. They hope
that this strategy will render economic growth more robust and sustainable and lead to
development gains that are more inclusive, helping make a meaningful dent against poverty.

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2004 Article IV Consultation with the
Philippines
On March 7, 2005, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded the
Article IV consultation with the Philippines.1
Background
Since taking office in July 2004, the new administration has formulated a set of reforms to
address the Philippines’ long-standing problems in the fiscal, power, and banking sectors.
Two of President Arroyo’s proposed tax reform bills have been enacted including increasing
alcohol and tobacco excises. In the power sector, a 40 percent hike in generation tariffs has
been provisionally awarded, while the sale of a large generation plant has also been
announced. In the banking sector, the disposal of nonperforming assets has begun.
However, these are a small component of the total reform required. In fact, while financial
markets have been relatively stable since the election, rating agencies have recently
downgraded the sovereign rating on the grounds that the tax reforms to date have been
inadequate.
GDP growth has exceeded expectations, but unemployment remains high. With exports staging
a recovery and consumption boosted by overseas remittances and the election, GDP grew by
6.1 percent in 2004, up from 4.7 percent in 2003. On the production side, the growth drivers
were strong performances by agriculture and services such as telecommunications,
business process outsourcing, and tourism. Employment increased by 3.6 percent in 2004,
Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On
return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the
Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of
the Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the
country's authorities.

-2mainly reflecting the rapid creation of services sector jobs. Even so, unemployment averaged
11.8 percent in 2004, up from 11.5 percent in 2003.
Inflation has risen above the target range. The rate of inflation (1994 base) climbed to
7.9 percent y/y in December, from 3.1 percent y/y in December 2003, causing average inflation
to increase to 5.5 percent, above the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP)’s target range of
4-5 percent. The primary cause was a succession of supply shocks, led by a jump in meat and
fish prices and followed by the surge in world oil prices and, more recently, the hike in power
tariffs. Nonetheless, some signs have emerged of more broad-based inflationary pressures,
including a rise in core inflation. The BSP has so far kept policy rates on hold, preferring to wait
for more definitive evidence that inflation is becoming generalized before taking monetary policy
action.
The national government deficit (authorities’ definition) is estimated to have declined to
3.8 percent of GDP in 2004, below the budget target of 4.2 percent of GDP, and down from
4.6 percent of GDP in 2003. Revenue is estimated to have remained broadly unchanged as a
share of GDP, while primary spending has been compressed. The major sources of expenditure
savings were personnel services, due to the absence of a general wage increase for the second
consecutive year, and transfers to local government units staying fixed in nominal terms as a
result of the re-enactment of the 2003 budget. However, power sector losses expanded to
1.5 percent of GDP in 2004, from 1.1 percent of GDP in 2003, and the nonfinancial public sector
deficit is estimated to have only declined to 5.3 percent of GDP in 2004, compared to
5.6 percent of GDP in 2003.
The balance of payments proved fairly resilient in 2004. Strong growth of exports, tourism
receipts, and remittances more than offset higher oil imports, causing the current account
surplus to increase slightly to an estimated 4½ percent of GDP in 2004. For much of the year,
this surplus looked insufficient to finance net capital outflows and negative errors and
omissions, and a loss of foreign exchange reserves was expected. However, in the fourth
quarter, the weak U.S. dollar took pressure off the peso and allowed the BSP to make modest
purchases of foreign exchange. As a result, reserves, adjusted for pledged assets, ended the
year up slightly at US$15 billion (119 percent of short-term debt by residual maturity).
The near-term outlook for the Philippine economy is clouded by the uncertain external
environment. The rapid growth in 2004 is unlikely to be sustained, particularly given slowing
global demand in the information technology sector and rising interest rates. Thus, staff expects
GDP to grow at a more moderate 4¾ percent in 2005. However, there are uncertainties on both
the upside and downside, depending on oil price movements, the strength of world demand,
and weather conditions (which affect agriculture production). Staff expects inflation (using the
new 2000 base) to remain above the target range of 5–6 percent in 2005.
Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors noted that the economy has recorded strong economic growth in 2004,
mainly driven by a recovery in exports and consumption, but that inflation has risen and
unemployment has remained high. Directors welcomed the efforts being made by the
administration to lay out a comprehensive package of reforms aimed at addressing the
country’s long-standing problems in the fiscal, power, and banking sectors, and in reducing its
high debt levels. They praised the authorities’ commitment to win the necessary political support
for key reform measures, and were encouraged by a number of recent developments, including

-3the passage of the bill raising alcohol and tobacco excises, and the recent increase in duties on
oil and petroleum imports. Directors also welcomed the provisional tariff increase awarded to
the National Power Corporation (NPC), and the recently announced sale of a large power plant.
Notwithstanding these welcome steps, Directors cautioned that, with the major part of the
reform agenda still unfinished, vulnerabilities arising from the country’s large external debt and
financing requirements remain high. Thus, the economy remains susceptible to external shocks,
especially changes in market sentiment and increases in global interest rates and oil prices.
Moreover, Directors noted that, even with benign global conditions, the Philippines could find it
difficult to meet its large external borrowing needs should the reform momentum falter.
Against this background, Directors regarded the full and quick implementation of the authorities’
reform package as essential to reduce the vulnerabilities of the Philippine economy, achieve
public debt sustainability over the medium term, and improve the investment and business
climate. In particular, they attached importance to the passage of further tax measures with a
clear and certain revenue yield, and also called for sustained reforms in other areas, such as
the power sector, financial sector, and pension funds. Directors noted that such reforms will set
the stage for higher economic growth, sustained reductions in unemployment and poverty, and
achievement of the Millennium Development Goals. They therefore urged the authorities to take
advantage of the unique opportunity afforded by the favorable post-election political
environment to make a decisive break from the past and implement the urgently-needed
reforms. It was also suggested that account should be taken of the economy’s capacity to
absorb reform measures, and the need to provide adequate safety nets.
Directors commended the authorities for maintaining control over the budget in 2004 despite
election-related pressures, and for resisting pressures to limit the domestic pass-through of
higher global oil prices in 2004, since the fiscal costs would have been unaffordable. However,
with regard to 2005, most Directors emphasized the importance of a strong and front-loaded
fiscal adjustment, so as to send a strong signal to markets about the commitment to tackling the
fiscal problem.
Directors looked forward to the passage of additional revenue-raising measures as early as
possible in 2005. In this context, Directors particularly welcomed the consideration being given
to raising the VAT rate and repealing VAT exemptions. Directors noted that a substantial
revenue yield from these measures will allow an aggressive upfront reduction in the deficit,
as well as some additional spending in priority areas including infrastructure and social
programs. In order to facilitate further fiscal consolidation over the medium term, Directors
urged that additional steps be taken to improve tax administration, such as improved audit
strategies and increased prosecution of evaders. In this context, several Directors warned
against the introduction of a tax amnesty, which they believed will discourage future tax
compliance.
Directors welcomed the efforts being made by the authorities to reform the civil service and
improve the delivery of services, but emphasized the need for the reform to be underpinned by
an affordable severance package. Directors also looked forward to the development of pension
reforms that will place public pensions on a sustainable footing.
Directors viewed the significant increase in generation tariffs provisionally awarded to the NPC
as an important contribution to the fiscal consolidation efforts. While welcoming the recent

-4progress, Directors urged the authorities to accelerate the pace of power sector privatization,
which is essential to restore the financial viability of the sector and to facilitate the investments
needed to ensure adequate power supply. Directors looked forward to the authorities achieving
their objectives of selling the transmission assets as soon as possible, and privatizing the
majority of generation assets by the end of 2005. With regard to energy regulation,
Directors stressed the importance of building a track record of adherence to a predictable
rules-based framework so as to improve the investment climate.
Directors agreed that supply shocks have been the root cause of the inflation target having
been missed in 2004, but pointed to a number of signs that price pressures have spread.
Directors were also concerned that the persistence of above-target inflation for a prolonged
period might lead to an upward revision to inflationary expectations. A number of Directors
supported the approach of the BSP to continue to closely monitor inflationary pressures—in
particular, weigh the evidence for inflation having become more generalized—and to take
prompt action as needed. Many other Directors, however, took the view that the balance has
already tipped, and that an increase in policy rates is required to guide inflationary expectations
down. More generally, Directors welcomed the BSP’s clear communication to the public that
monetary policy will be guided by the inflation objective, as well as its commitment to continuing
to manage the exchange rate flexibly.
Directors were encouraged that banks have begun to use the special purpose vehicle
framework to dispose of nonperforming assets. They also welcomed the submission to
Congress of amendments to the BSP Charter that are critical to strengthening bank supervision,
and the efforts that have been taken to tighten regulation of the banks’ trust operations.
Directors viewed these steps as crucial to facilitating consolidation and recapitalization of the
banking system, thereby fortifying the banking system and enabling it to fully contribute to
economic growth. However, Directors noted that attempts to empower bank supervisors have
repeatedly failed in the past, and that significant efforts will be needed to ensure that the current
amendments are accepted. Directors commended the authorities for strengthening the antimoney laundering regime and welcomed the removal of the Philippines from the Financial
Action Task Force’s list of Non-Cooperative Countries and Territories. The authorities were also
encouraged to take steps to further deepen financial markets, including the domestic capital
market.
Directors welcomed the recognition in the Medium-Term Philippine Development Plan of
weaknesses in the investment climate, and urged the authorities to push ahead with the needed
reforms. In this regard, they attached importance to measures with respect to bankruptcy
resolution, contract enforcement, and business entry regulation.
Directors welcomed the authorities’ attempts to further strengthen statistics and looked forward
to continued implementation of the recommendations of recent Fund technical assistance on
balance of payments and public debt statistics.

-6Adjusted Reserves, which are calculated by subtracting from GIR the value of the BSP's foreign assets
that have been pledged as collateral for short-term liabilities. These pledged assets (gold and other
securities) remain foreign reserve assets of the BSP and so are considered part of GIR. However, they
are not as readily usable as other components of GIR since pledged assets must be set aside while the
short-term liabilities they secure remain outstanding.
