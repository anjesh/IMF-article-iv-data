

Extended Credit Facility arrangement: The first review under the Extended Credit Facility (ECF)
arrangement was concluded on April 4, 2011, on a lapse-of-time basis. The Executive Board approved a
three-year ECF arrangement for SDR 41.88 million (120 percent of quota) in June 2010, against the
backdrop of a sharp fall in revenues from the Southern African Customs Union (SACU). The authorities
are requesting an augmentation of access in an amount equivalent to SDR 8.73 million (25 percent of
quota) to cushion the impact of the 2010–11 flood damage and high international commodity prices.



Review: The ECF-supported program is on track. All quantitative performance criteria for end-March
and end-September 2011 were met. Structural reforms have been progressing, albeit with some delay.
The second review—originally scheduled for completion in August 2011—was postponed pending the
finalization of the National Strategic Development Plan (NSDP). With the recent submission of the
NSDP to the Boards of the IMF and the World Bank as a PRS document, staff recommends completion
of the second and third reviews under the ECF arrangement. Staff also supports the authorities’ request
for augmentation of access under the arrangement, given continued financing needs for flood-related
rehabilitation programs.



Discussions: The mission visited Maseru June 15–28, December 2–15, 2011, and
February 17–23, 2012 and met with Finance and Development Planning Minister Thahane; Central Bank
of Lesotho Governor Matlanyane; other senior government officials; and representatives of the donor
community, the private sector, and labor unions. The staff team comprised J. Honda (head), M. Morgan,
S. Thomas, D. Benicio, A. Oshima, F. Gwenhamo (all AFR), M. Tharkur and C. Saborowski (both SPR).
Press releases were issued at the end of the June and December 2011 missions.



Exchange regime: Lesotho is a member of the Common Monetary Area (CMA) and the Lesotho loti is
pegged at par to the South African Rand, which is also legal tender in the country. Lesotho has accepted
the obligations of Article VIII, Sections 2, 3, and 4, of the Articles of Agreement and maintains an
exchange system free of restrictions on the making of payments and transfers for current international
transactions.



Publication: The authorities have consented to publication of the staff report and the program
documents.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
Despite the unfavorable external environment, Lesotho has maintained robust growth,
mainly driven by an expanding mining sector. Real GDP growth for 2010/11 is estimated
at 5¾ percent; inflation rose gradually in 2011, driven by international commodity prices.
Despite the sharp drop in Southern African Customs Union (SACU) revenues, fiscal
performance in 2010/11 was much better than programmed, reflecting higher domestic
revenue collections and cuts in recurrent spending. The non-SACU balance improved sharply
from a deficit of 37 percent of GDP in 2009/10 to a deficit of 21 percent of GDP in 2010/11.
This strong fiscal consolidation effort helped to limit the external current account deficit to
15 percent of GDP in 2010/11.
Macroeconomic conditions remain challenging for 2011/12, because of the impact of
floods and high international commodity prices. The floods through early 2011 caused
widespread damage and loss of lives. Agriculture was hard hit, necessitating emergency food
imports. Infrastructure damage has also been significant. The total cost for post-flood
recovery and reconstruction is estimated at 3½ percent of GDP. Because of these pressures,
Lesotho continues to face pressure on international reserves. With further fiscal adjustment
efforts, the fiscal balance is now expected to exceed program targets for 2011/12. Against
this background, the authorities are requesting augmentation of access under the Extended
Credit Facility (ECF) arrangement to help address the balance of payment needs resulting
from these shocks.
The ECF-supported program is on track. All quantitative performance criteria for endMarch 2011 and end-September 2011 were met. Three structural benchmarks for end-March
and end-June have been implemented as programmed, while two benchmarks were
implemented with delays. Two remaining benchmarks—including the completion of an audit
of domestic arrears—are expected to be completed by end-March, and one has been
postponed to end-September 2012.
Policy discussions focused on policies to ensure macroeconomic stability and achieve
sustained growth in the medium-term. Given Lesotho’s vulnerability to exogenous shocks,
sound fiscal and macro policies would ensure an adequate level of international reserves to
maintain the exchange rate peg. The authorities are committed to maintaining fiscal
adjustment efforts to restore fiscal and external sustainability, targeting an international
reserve cushion of five months of imports over the medium-term. The economic program
includes appropriate measures to improve revenue collection and expenditure rationalization,
while safeguarding priority social spending. With further adjustment efforts, as well as with
some recovery in SACU revenues, the overall fiscal position is projected to record a balance
in 2012/13. To achieve sustained growth and increase employment, structural reforms to
promote private sector development is called for, as recognized in the National Strategic
Development Plan (NSDP).
Staff recommends completion of the second and third reviews under the three-year
ECF arrangement, and the augmentation of access to resources under the ECF
arrangement by SDR 8.73 million (equivalent to 25 percent of quota) as this would help
Lesotho achieve an adequate level of reserves to reduce balance of payments risks. Risks to
the program can be mitigated by sound policies and reforms, in coordination with Lesotho’s
development partners.

I. INTRODUCTION
1.
In recent years, Lesotho was faced with a significant fall in revenues from the
Southern African Customs Union (SACU), necessitating sizable macroeconomic
adjustments. During the 2009 Article IV consultation discussion, Executive Directors
observed significant challenges going forward because the projected decline in SACU
revenues was expected to result in large fiscal and external deficits. In this light, actions were
required on several fronts; containing the growth of non-priority expenditure (while
safeguarding spending on vulnerable groups), enhancing the efficiency of public expenditure,
and strengthening the mobilization of non-SACU revenues. To promote broad-based growth,
they also stressed the need for efforts to reduce the cost of doing business and improve the
investment climate, in line with the authorities’ strategy to advance economic diversification
and facilitate private sector development.
2.
The authorities have been implementing reforms in line with the Fund advice.
Adjustment policies under the Extended Credit Facility (ECF) have been implemented since
June 2010. The impacts of the SACU revenue fall on fiscal and external balances have been
mitigated, in part through significant fiscal tightening.
3.
Nonetheless, new challenges have emerged. The floods through early 2011 caused
widespread damage and loss of lives across the country. The agricultural sector has been
particularly affected, with heavy losses of crops and livestock, thus giving rise to the need for
emergency food imports. Infrastructure damage (to roads, water supply and sanitation) has
also been significant. In addition, international commodity prices have stayed high, while
uncertainties surrounding global economic outlook are persisting. In this context, the
emphasis in the remainder of Lesotho’s ECF-supported adjustment program is to step up
fiscal adjustment effort in the medium-term (including reforms in public financial
management and tax administration), enhance growth through improving the business
climate and promote financial intermediation under proper supervisory oversight. The
authorities are seeking external support, including augmentation of access under the ECF
arrangement, to address the increased balance of payments needs.

Despite the flood-related damage, Lesotho
has maintained robust growth, driven mainly by an
expanding mining sector. Agriculture—which was
already facing rising costs of inputs such as fertilizer
and fuel—had to bear heavy losses of crops and
livestock because of the floods. The infrastructure
damage also affected the transportation and commercial
sectors. Mining sector, however, grew rapidly in
response to strong international demand, high prices,
and resumption of operations of two mines (Box 1).

Inflation rose in 2011. After moderating to
3.1 percent by December 2010—benefiting from the
strong South African rand to which the local currency
is pegged—inflation steadily increased in 2011 and
headline inflation reached 7 percent in December,
reflecting high international commodity prices and
agricultural supply shortages following months of
floods.

fiscal adjustment in 2010/11 to address the sharp
drop in SACU revenues. Fiscal performance was better than programmed, as a result of
higher domestic revenue collections (including transfer of the central bank’s retained
earnings) and cuts in recurrent spending. The core SACU fiscal deficit declined from
20 percent of GDP in 2009/10 to 5½ percent of GDP in 2010/11 (see text table).1 This
improvement contained the external current account deficit to 15 percent of GDP in 2010/11.

In 2011/12, higher government spending—albeit below program expectation—is

The core SACU fiscal balance—defined as the fiscal balance excluding the volatile component of SACU
revenues and foreign-financed project loans—is the key policy anchor for fiscal consolidation efforts. The
volatile component of SACU revenues is defined as the total SACU revenues minus the core component
equivalent to 15 percent of GDP. This is the lowest annual SACU receipt in the last two decades.

The ECF-supported program is on track. All quantitative performance criteria
(PCs) for end-March and September 2011 were met. Net domestic financing of the
government and net international reserves were well above the targets, reflecting the
authorities’ stepped-up adjustment efforts and postponement of some capital projects to
2012/13. The indicative target for the floor on social spending was also met. Finally,
spending on key social programs, such as the school feeding program, old-age pensions, and
HIV/AIDS have been preserved, with the floor increased to M732 million, equivalent to
3½ percent of GDP.
9.
Structural reforms have progressed, albeit with some delays. Three structural
benchmarks for end-March and end-June have been implemented as programmed, while the
reforms covered by two other benchmarks were implemented with delays, and three
structural benchmarks have been postponed. In the financial sector, the Financial Institutions
Bill was submitted to parliament in March 2011 and enacted in February 2012, paving the
way for further strengthening of the supervisory and regulatory framework for banks and
nonbanks. In public financial management (PFM), the audit of domestic arrears was not
completed, in part because of problems with the Integrated Financial Management
Information System (IFMIS). Based on recommendations of IMF technical assistance in July
2011, a time-bound audit plan has been formulated to complete the audit by end-March 2012
(MEFP ¶16).

Box 1. Lesotho: Diamond Sector
Diamond production is becoming an important source of growth in Lesotho. The diamond sector
only accounted for less than ½ percent of GDP until early 2000s. However, in recent years, the sector
has grown significantly, with the reactivation of three mines. The sector accounted for 7 percent of
GDP in 2010/11. With further expansion of the existing mines and coming onstream of more mines,
the diamond sector is expected to grow further, exceeding 20 percent of GDP by 2016/17. This pace
of expansion of the sector is prominent, compared with neighboring diamond-producing countries.
Lesotho’s diamonds are of high quality and the value per carat of rough diamonds is the highest in the
world. Historically, the price of diamond has been more volatile than those of diamonds produced in
neighboring countries.

The diamond sector has a large impact on Lesotho’s economy, through various channels—
exports, government revenue, and employment:


Exports. Diamond export is expected to increase significantly from 24 percent of total exports in
2010 to 54 percent in 2016. Furthermore, a significant amount of FDI, about US$1,100 million, is
expected in the next five years. Both diamond export and foreign investment in diamond mines
generate foreign earnings, although their net impact on international reserves would be limited
because of associated foreign outflows (through profit transfers to foreign mining companies and
imports of capital goods for mining).



Government revenues. The diamond sector contributes to fiscal revenue through four channels:
corporate tax, dividend payments on state shareholdings, royalties and land rent. In 2011/12, the
government is projected to collect about 330 million maloti (about 4 percent of total revenues).
With further growth of the diamond sector and diminishing depreciation cost of the new mines,
corporate taxes and royalties are expected to increase; and the share of the revenues from the
diamond sector would increase to about 8 percent of total revenues by 2016/17.



Employment. Employment creation in the diamond sector has been modest because diamond
mining is capital intensive in nature. The sector employs about 2,000 workers (about 0.3 percent
of the total employment) and is expected to absorb another 1,000 workers by 2016/17, with
activation of some new plants.

III. ARTICLE IV CONSULTATION DISCUSSION
A. Policies to Ensure Macroeconomic Stability
Restoring macroeconomic stability in the face of the sharp drop in SACU revenues is
essential to preserving short-term growth. In the short-term, the key policy objectives are to
maintain fiscal and external sustainability, while ensuring sufficient financing for the postflood recovery and reconstruction.
10.
The floods and high commodity prices have added pressure on international
reserves, with an estimated increase in

to 2½ percent of GDP).
11.
The authorities have made further progress in fiscal consolidation, while
covering part of flood-related capital outlays in 2011/12. Despite such additional
spending needs, the authorities are committed to containing the overall fiscal deficit at
10½ percent of GDP in 2011/12, lower than the level (15 percent) agreed to during the first
review of the ECF-supported program. The authorities have maintained strict control over
spending on goods and services. To cover the remainder of the flood-related cost, the
authorities have also sought development partners’ support, while drawing down on its
limited reserves buffer. Following the establishment of a fund, Lesotho’s development
partners have so far pledged US$2.8 million (about 3 percent of the total costs).
12.
To help achieve their fiscal consolidation targets in the short and medium term,
the authorities plan to enhance the efficiency of revenue administration and improve
the quality of spending. Based on technical assistance from the IMF, the authorities will
undertake a full restructuring of the Lesotho Revenue Authority (LRA) in 2012/13, including
the operationalization of a full-service Large Tax Payer Unit by end-March 2013, which will
cater to medium-to-large taxpayers. In the event that revenues turn out higher than expected
in 2012/13, the authorities plan to use the additional resources to rebuild their deposits at the
Central Bank of Lesotho (CBL). On the expenditure side, emphasis will be on strengthening
cash management, facilitating reconciliation of government accounts at the central bank and
commercial banks, and prioritizing social and development spending. Attention will also be
paid to stricter enforcement of the use of budgetary contingencies, to ensure their use for real
unforeseen emergencies.

Box 2. Lesotho: Impacts of Recent Floods and High International Commodity Prices
on International Reserves
Lesotho experienced flood rains starting in late-December 2010, causing large import needs for
reconstruction and recovery. The agricultural sector was most affected, followed by road transport
and commerce, raising concerns about food security in rural areas. The Food and Agricultural
Organization estimates that in some of the worst-hit districts, up to 60 percent of crops has been
destroyed, and the Post-Disaster Needs Assessment (PDNA)—jointly conducted by the government of
Lesotho and its development partners—reports that Lesotho has been on the verge of a food security
crisis, starting in the second half of 2011 through the summer crop harvest in 2012. The PDNA
estimated recovery and reconstruction costs at M649 million ($88 million). The total cost includes
food imports and infrastructure repairs, resulting in overall flood-related imports of about $61 million
(2.4 percent of GDP).
Commodity price shocks are projected to exert a sizable impact on the balance of payments in
2011/12 and to a lesser extent in 2012/13. Oil imports are projected to grow by 30 percent in
2011/12 while food imports are projected to grow by 29 percent in value. The main drivers in both
cases are increasing commodity prices while elevated prices of diamond exports somewhat bolstered
the adverse impact of import prices. Assuming that commodity prices had grown at the rate expected
at the time of program request as a counterfactual, staff estimates that increases in food and oil prices
will result in a cost of about $83 million in 2011/12 and 2012/13. When subtracting the higher value
of diamond exports owing to diamond price increases, the net additional cost is $44 million over the
same period.
Commodity price shocks and flood-related imports have weakened the balance of payments.
Flood related imports and the additional net cost of commodity prices put pressure on the balance of
payments. Staff estimates that the total impact of the two exogenous shocks will be a loss of
$105 million (equivalent to 4.2 percent of GDP) in international reserves.

B. Policies to Achieve Sustained Growth in the Medium-Term
Over the medium-term, to achieve the objective of “sustained economic growth as the most
effective route for poverty reduction” the authorities plan to focus on lowering Lesotho’s
vulnerability to shocks and stepping up structural reforms to promote private sector
development.
Lowering Lesotho’s vulnerability to external shocks
13.
Sufficient international reserve cushion and sound debt management are
essential for lowering Lesotho’s vulnerability to exogenous shocks. Lesotho has been
particularly vulnerable to shocks because of its narrow production base and heavy reliance on
SACU revenues. Looking back, Lesotho had successfully accumulated reserves covering
5–7 months of imports in 2007–09, providing an effective cushion against the recent drop in
SACU revenues. Going forward, policy objective should be to maintain fiscal and debt
sustainability.2 To prepare for future shocks, the authorities should aim at rebuilding an
international reserves buffer of 5–7 months of imports.3
14.
Given the desirability of maintaining the peg, Lesotho will have to rely heavily
on fiscal adjustment to accumulate international

reserves. Staff and the authorities agreed that the

6

anchor price stability while facilitating capital and
current transactions with South Africa.4 In this

context, staff urged that, to achieve an adequate

anchored on achieving a surplus on the core-SACU
balance by 2015/16.
2

Based on a preliminary LIC DSA, Lesotho remains at moderate risk of debt distress. Debt ratios are projected
to remain manageable over the medium-term as SACU revenues recover and the fiscal position improves.
3

This suggested range is broadly consistent with the estimated optimal reserves, based on a cost-benefit
approach (“Optimal Precautionary Reserves for Low-Income Countries: A Cost-Benefit Analysis”, IMF
Working Paper, October 2011). Taking into account a country’s exchange rate regime, its fiscal position and the
presence of an IMF program, among other factors, the approach helps to quantify the optimal level of
international reserves in low-income countries.

4

In terms of the exchange rate, there is no clear indication of misalignment. Lesotho’s real effective exchange
rate (REER) appreciated gradually between the beginning of 2009 and end 2010, but has since depreciated
somewhat. Exchange rate assessments based on several approaches suggest that the Loti is closed to its
equilibrium value (Box 3).

11
15.
The authorities reaffirmed that the exchange rate peg has helped anchor
macroeconomic and financial stability in Lesotho and agreed that fiscal restraint is
needed to help sustain the peg. Medium-term fiscal consolidation would alleviate potential
pressures on Lesotho’s external balance. They argued that, as a low income country, the
opportunity cost of holding excess reserves is high, given Lesotho’s significant development
needs. The challenge is to strike a fair balance between holding adequate reserves and
undertaking capital spending for development. To prepare for future shocks, the authorities
agreed with the medium-term objective of building up an international reserve cushion of a
minimum of five months of imports.
Box 3. Lesotho: Exchange Rate Assessment

An exchange rate assessment exercise based on an adapted version of the IMF’s Consultative Group on
Exchange Rate Issues (CGER) methodology suggests that the Loti is close to its equilibrium value as of
end-November 2011. The CGER methodology was adapted to cover sub-Saharan economies.1
Combining three approaches suggests that the Loti is broadly in line with its equilibrium value.


The external sustainability approach assesses the level of the current account balance that
would stabilize the country’s net foreign asset position. It suggests that the Loti is about
4 percent overvalued.



The equilibrium real exchange rate approach computes the real effective exchange rate
(REER)’s percentage deviation from its equilibrium value determined on the basis of
macroeconomic fundamentals. It suggests that the Loti is about 7 percent overvalued.



The macroeconomic balance approach compares Lesotho’s medium-term external current
account to a country-specific norm based on macro fundamentals. It suggests that the Loti is
about 4 percent undervalued.

To properly estimate the progress in fiscal adjustment in the presence of high
volatility of SACU revenues, staff endorsed

17.
For 2012/13, while the SACU
revenues will recover significantly, the authorities—maintaining their adjustment
effort—are targeting a core SACU fiscal deficit of 8½ percent of GDP. This is slightly
higher than the projected outcome for 2011/12
(MEFP ¶14), because of the following spending needs:


higher health care spending (1.8 percent of GDP) to keep the recently-built referral
hospital and donor financed health clinics fully operational;



higher old age pension payment (0.3 percent of GDP) to afford the minimum cost of
living (about US$47 per month);



enhanced defense force to meet SADC requirements for a standby peace-keeping
force (0.3 percent of GDP);



additional cost of national elections in
2012 (0.3 percent of GDP) to ensure that
they meet international standards for
security, logistics and infrastructure; and

through a combination of (i) restraining wages by restricting new positions in civil service,
and keeping civil servant wages constant in real terms; and (ii) reducing non-priority outlays
through stricter expenditure controls resulting from the effective implementation of the
Integrated Financial Management Information System (IFMIS) (MEFP ¶14). With these
adjustment efforts, as well as with an expected recovery in SACU revenues, the overall fiscal
position is projected to be in balance by 2012/13—the first time since the crisis emerged in
2008/09.
18.
These fiscal consolidation efforts in 2012/13 will be maintained over the
medium-term, with a view to reducing dependence on SACU revenues and rebuilding
international reserves, Recurrent expenditures are projected to decline over time and the
core SACU fiscal balance is expected to steadily improve (Table 3), and thereby help to
rebuild sufficient international reserves.

Structural reforms to promote private sector development
Discussions on structural measures addressed the array of reforms that may be needed to
address high unemployment and inequality and to help diversify the economy.

To achieve sustained growth and increase employment, private sector
development is important, as recognized in the National Strategic Development Plan

As agreed under the program, nonconcessional financing will be used only for the Metolong Dam project. In
addition, while spending commitments under Lesotho Highlands Water Project Phase II (LHWP2) remain
uncertain and the authorities are assessing medium-term financing options, it is unlikely that financing will be
available on concessional terms. Thus, provisions for additional nonconcessional financing may need to be
considered in the future.

(NSDP). The NSDP expects the private sector to be the engine of growth, while
acknowledging an “uncompetitive business environment” as one of the most binding
constraints to the sector. Specifically those constraints include; a high regulatory burden to
open and close business and low access to credit. Among these constraints, the discussion
focused on the approaches to enhance access to credit and improve the business environment.

The authorities continue to commit to implementing reforms to improve the
business climate to support private sector-led growth and economic diversification. The
Industrial Licensing Bill (structural benchmark) is expected to improve the licensing process,
further reducing delays and making the whole procedure transparent. The authorities have
also made steady progress in promoting financial sector development by improving access to
financial services, through a partial guarantee scheme and micro financial services
(MEFP, ¶17-18). Effective implementation of the new Financial Institutions Act (FIA) will
help to reduce financial sector risks, covering nonbank financial institutions under the
supervision by the CBL (Box 4). These reforms to support private sector-led growth and
economic diversification are important for broad-based inclusive growth, leading to a
recovery in national income after a long period of stagnation (Box 5). Furthermore, the
authorities should continue to take steps to ensure the effective implementation of the
recommendations made in the anti-money laundering and combating the financing of
terrorism (AML/CFT) report of the Eastern and Southern Africa Anti-Money Laundering
Group (ESAAMLG) in September 2011.7

7

In particular, the authorities are encouraged to further operationalize the Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU),
adequately criminalize money laundering and terrorist financing, introduce laws and regulations to implement
United Nations Security Council Resolutions (UNSCRs) 1267 and 1373 and put in place the appropriate
customer due diligence (CDD) and record-keeping requirements in the financial and non-financial sectors.

Box 4. Lesotho: Non-bank Financial Institutions
Non-bank financial sector in Lesotho is diverse and made up of an ever expanding
spectrum of deposit taking and non-deposit taking institutions varying in size, numbers
and type of financial services they provide. It includes insurance companies; registered
money lenders; credit only institutions; pension funds; collective investment schemes; asset
management companies; exchange bureau; money transfers companies and insurance brokers
and agents.

The overall assets of the non-bank financial institutions (NBFIs), as a whole, are
significant, standing at 31.7 percent of GDP in 2010, with insurance and pension funds
being the two largest subsectors each with asset size at 14 percent of GDP. The sector grew
by 8.7 percent of GDP from 2007 to 2010, faster than the pace (5.3 percent of GDP) of the
formal commercial banking sector in the same period. The number of operative NBFIs in
2010 reached 235, compared with 185 in 2007.
A key challenge for the sector going forward relates to its proper regulation and
supervision. While the banking sector (made up mainly of subsidiaries of South African
parents’ banks) has been well regulated and supervised, the NBFIs were generally not
comprehensively supervised. This void has been filled through the implementation of the
Financial institutions Act (FIA), an umbrella legislation which will guide all aspects of
regulations and supervision of both bank and non-bank financial institutions. Currently all
these regulations are being updated in line with the FIA, stepped-up efforts are required to
strengthen supervisory capacity to properly implement the FIA.

In Lesotho, GNI has stagnated for the last few
decades, despite steady GDP growth. GNI per
capita grew at an annual average of only
1 percent a year between 2001 and 2010,
compared with real GDP growth of about 4
percent over the same period. The World Bank
(Lesotho: Third Poverty Reduction Support
Grant and Credit Program, May 31, 2011)
pointed that, despite good economic growth,
inequality (Gini coefficient of 0.66) and
unemployment (22.7 percent in 2008) stay high,
suggesting that the benefits of growth have
not easily reached the poor. This highlights a
uniqueness of the Lesotho
economy―compared with other countries in
the region―where worker remittances have
declined systematically over time. While
Lesotho has a relatively high proportion of its
labor force employed outside the country, the
number of Basotho workers in the mines of
South Africa has declined, partly because of a
shift toward the use of South Africa’s local
labor.

C. Medium-term Outlook
22.
The baseline medium-term economic outlook for Lesotho is favorable but
downside risks remain.


The baseline scenario assumes continued fiscal consolidation and stepped-up
structural reforms, in line with the NSDP. Real GDP growth will average about
4½ percent a year for 2012/13–2016/17. With steady progress in fiscal consolidation
efforts, gradual replenishment of gross official international reserves is expected to bring
import coverage to five months of imports by 2015/16.

Although the macroeconomic objectives and the strategy laid out are
appropriate, the medium-term outlook is clouded with significant downside risks.
Specifically, in the face of uncertain global economic environments, Lesotho faces a risk of
fall in SACU revenues and unexpected decline in global demand for diamond.8 9

8

With new mines coming on stream, diamond production (which accounts for about 8 percent of GDP) is
projected to exceed 20 percent of GDP by 2016/17. This projection, however, posed high risk because of
uncertain prospects for global demand for diamond.
9

SACU revenues have proven to be very volatile. The sharp drop in 2010/11-2011/12 is the result of
repayments to the Common Revenue Pool (CRP) totalling some 14 percent of GDP, owing to overpayments of
the revenues for 2008/09 and 2009/10, when South Africa’s imports were affected by the global economic
crisis. Increases in subsequent years reflect the combination of projected increases in the CRP owing to largerthan-expected increases in custom duties and excise taxes by South Africa, and the absence of any repayment

24.
Possible implications of a deteriorating global economic outlook were discussed,
including taking additional adjustment measures, as needed, in the event of a deep
global economic slowdown. Based on the baseline scenario above, an alternative mediumterm scenario assumes the impacts of a possible global economic slowdown in 2012/13–
2013/14 (similar to that experienced in 2008–09), with lower diamond production and SACU
revenues. Lesotho’s average growth rate would be lowered by about 1 percent during the
period. With no additional adjustment effort (on top of what is envisaged under the baseline
scenario), the fiscal balance would be worsened by 7‒10 percent of GDP, and international
reserves would fall to about 1 month of imports by 2014/15. The staff advised the authorities
to stay vigilant on Lesotho’s external environments and be prepared to take additional
adjustment measures. In the event of such a shock, additional fiscal tightening would be
required. The authorities appreciated the staff’s sensitivity analysis and underscored the need
to prepare for further shocks.

IV. PROGRAM MONITORING, POVERTY REDUCTION STRATEGY, AND SAFEGUARDS
ASSESSMENT
A. Case for Augmentation
25.
The authorities have requested an augmentation of access under the ECF
arrangement in amount equivalent to SDR8.73 million (25 percent of quota to be
by Lesotho to the CRP. Should the imports decline in 2012/13, the revenue flows in 2013/14 and beyond could
be affected.

19
disbursed with the third and fourth tranches under the program) to help maintain an
adequate level of international reserves.10 It would complement Lesotho’s domestic
adjustment efforts and additional donor support. The need for the augmentation reflect the
following:


Following a sharp fall in SACU revenues in 2010/11 and 2011/12, new shocks (floods
and high commodity prices) have put additional pressure on fiscal and external balances.



The augmentation would help achieve an adequate level of international reserves in
support of Lesotho’s exchange rate peg to the South African rand. Lesotho’s international
reserves would recover to about 3½ months of imports by end-March 2013.



The augmentation is part of a concerted effort by development partners to address the
recent shocks. A few development partners have already offered some assistance.11 The
proposed augmentation would add some US$14 million, equivalent to 0.5 percent of
GDP to mitigate the impact of the shocks on international reserves. The authorities are
also seeking financial support from other partners, and expecting that the IMF’s decision
on the augmentation will catalyze additional resources.



Lesotho has a good policy track record, as evidenced by the stronger-than-programmed
fiscal adjustment in 2010/11. It has responded prudently to the recent shocks, avoided
policies that cause economic distortions, and focused instead on social impact mitigation
and measures to boost food supply.



For 2011/12, the authorities have further strengthened their adjustment efforts as
evidenced by reprioritization of spending allowing for a significant under-execution of
the budget. The revised economic program includes an appropriate domestic adjustment
effort, and thus, despite the additional costs for flood-related damage, the authorities are
committed to containing the core-SACU fiscal deficit of 2011/12 at a level much lower
than the level agreed to during the first review of the ECF-supported program.



Lesotho’s capacity to repay the IMF would remain strong, supported by the authorities’
solid record of debt repayment. The augmentation would not materially affect debt
sustainability indicators.

10

The financing requirement for 2011/12 will be financed mainly by SACU transfers, and loans and grants from
development partners, and drawdown of reserves. With significant increase in SACU revenues and exports, the
overall balance is expected to improve in 2012/13. The ECF-supported program is projected to be fully financed
for the remainder of the program period.

11

The UN, UNDP, Ireland, People’s Republic of China, and OCHA have pledged the total of US$2.8 million
for the Disaster Risk Reduction Fund (DRRF). Following the preparation of operational guidelines for the
DRRF in November 2011, the Fund will become operational in 2012/13.

20
B. Program Monitoring
26.
The performance criteria (PCs) and benchmarks are proposed as shown in
MEFP, Table 1. Completion of the fourth, fifth, and sixth reviews of the arrangement by
August 20, 2012, February 20, 2013, and May 20, 2013, respectively, will be based on the
observance of quantitative PCs through end-March 2012, end-September 2012, and endMarch 2013, respectively (MEFP, Table 1). The targets for end-June 2012 and endDecember 2012 will be indicative. Structural benchmarks have been established through endDecember 2012 (MEFP, Table 3). The definitions of the variables monitored as quantitative
PCs are provided in the Technical Memorandum of Understanding (TMU), Appendix I,
Attachment 2.
C. Poverty Reduction Strategy
27.
The authorities, supported by development partners, have recently finalized a
comprehensive five-year National Strategic Development Plan (NSDP) covering
2012/13-2016/17. The NSDP, prepared following extensive nationwide public consultation,
has been submitted to the Boards of the IMF and the World Bank. It emphasizes the need to
achieve sustained economic growth as the most effective route for poverty reduction and also
to deliver sound macroeconomic management. In support of the macroeconomic policy
objectives, the NSDP aims at: providing an attractive environment for foreign and domestic
investment; encouraging domestic saving and foreign capital inflow; ensuring sustainable
levels of fiscal deficit and public debt; ensuring low and sustainable inflation; maintaining
sound external balances; and setting tax and expenditure policies that contribute to improving
the distribution of income and wealth.
28.
Staff welcomed the NSDP’s focus on sustained economic growth while ensuring
sound, stable macroeconomic management and promoting structural reforms, in line
with the objectives of the ECF-supported program. To this end, the NSDP—among other
things—underlines the need for fiscal consolidation, with a view to achieving an overall
fiscal surplus during the NSDP period. The medium-term fiscal framework of the NSDP is
less optimistic in terms of revenue projections than the fiscal framework under the ECFsupported program.12 The NSDP—in highlighting the impact of key structural reforms—also
explores various growth scenarios, with average GDP growth of 1.5 percent under the low
growth scenario, 5.8 percent under the moderate scenario and 6.7 percent under the Plan
scenario. For the purpose of the ECF-supported program and the budget, however, a more
conservative assumption (with average growth of 4.5 percent during 2012/13 and 2016/17) is
maintained. To help achieve high growth, the NSDP focuses on structural reforms in broad
12

Under the NSDP, assumption on mining dividends and water royalty collections are conservative relative to
the program assumptions. The program reflects updated revenue data with higher dividends and water royalties
in recent months, which are expected to continue over the medium-term.

21
areas, such as improving the investment climate and promoting financial intermediation. The
joint staff advisory note (JSAN) will be prepared by July 2012.
D. Safeguards Assessment
29.
The CBL has made substantial progress in implementing the 2010 safeguards
recommendations. Following the appointment of Deloitte (South Africa) as the CBL’s sole
external auditor in 2010, the audit of that year was completed within the three-month
statutory deadline and the audited financial statements were published in full on the CBL’s
website by mid-April 2011. Deloitte (South Africa) has been reappointed to conduct the 2011
external audit jointly with a local audit firm. It is expected that the audit will be completed by
end-March 2012. As recommended by the assessment, the CBL has also introduced internal
audits of monetary data submitted for program monitoring purposes. The authorities are
aware that in the event of an augmentation of the existing arrangement, an updated
assessment would need to be completed.
V. STAFF APPRAISAL
30.
Despite new shocks, program performance has been strong. In 2010/11 and the
first three quarters of 2011/12, the authorities made substantial progress on fiscal
consolidation, by reducing the overall fiscal deficit compared to the program target. This
strong fiscal performance—supported by progress in structural reforms—has served well to
limit the current account deficit, leading to higher-than-programmed accumulation of
international reserves.
31.
For the remainder of 2011/12, strong fiscal discipline should remain in place.
Despite additional spending needs, the overall deficit is expected to be contained below the
level agreed to during the first review of the ECF-supported program. Staff welcomes the
authorities’ commitment to staying the course on fiscal consolidation, largely through
reducing non priority expenditure. To help achieve the fiscal target, fiscal restraint must be
supported by further strengthening PFM and revenue administration.
32.
Lesotho’s medium-term economic outlook is favorable, though clouded by
significant downside risks. Economic growth is expected to be robust, because of an
expanding mining sector and externally financed investment projects. However, Lesotho
faces the risk of fall in SACU revenues and of an unexpected decline in global demand for
diamond. Medium-term growth prospects therefore depend critically on ongoing reforms to
improve the business environment and upgrade the physical infrastructure to aid in economic
diversification. Staff also encourages the authorities to stay vigilant on the developments in
Lesotho’s external environments.
33.
Over the medium term, stepped-up fiscal adjustment efforts are therefore
crucial to ensure fiscal and external sustainability, while protecting spending for
vulnerable groups and creating space for critical infrastructure investment. Staff encourages
the authorities to maintain adjustment efforts in order to rebuild international reserves and

22
place the country in a better position to respond to future shocks. To prepare for future
shocks, the authorities should build an international reserve cushion of 5‒7 months of
imports. In the event of a global economic slowdown, additional adjustment measures should
be implemented swiftly to alleviate potential pressures on Lesotho’s external balance.
34.
While the exchange rate seems to be broadly in line with its equilibrium rate,
further progress in structural reforms is called for to improve external competitiveness.
Analysis of the real exchange rate suggests there is no clear indication of misalignment,
while further structural reforms would help strengthen competitiveness. To this end, fasttracking of the reforms will improve the business climate and productivity, and will enable
Lesotho to overcome a number of its developmental challenges, including diversifying the
economy, achieving broad-based sustained growth, and reducing poverty. Preparation of a
new five-year NSDP provides an opportunity for the authorities to reevaluate their priorities
and refocus efforts on enhancing Lesotho’s long-term growth potential and ensuring job
creation.
35.
Staff welcomes progress made in strengthening the supervisory and framework
for banks and nonbank financial institutions. The measures are critical for mitigating
financial sector risks. Staff encourages the authorities’ to strengthen their efforts in
restructuring the CBL and building its capacity to effectively implement the new FIA.
Improving the access to financial services will enhance financial deepening and support
economic development.
36.
The data provided to the IMF are adequate for surveillance and program
monitoring purposes, but statistical weaknesses persist, most notably with regard to the
national accounts and balance of payments. IMF technical assistance is being targeted on
these areas.
37.
Based on Lesotho’s strong performance thus far and the authorities’ continued
commitment to maintaining fiscal consolidation, staff recommends completion of the
second and third reviews under the three-year ECF arrangement, and the
augmentation of access to resources under the arrangement by an amount of SDR
8.73 million (equivalent to 25 percent of quota). Risks to the program can be mitigated by
sound policies and reforms, in coordination with Lesotho’s development partners. Staff
recommends a single disbursement of the proposed augmentation, in view of (i) immediate
needs to rehabilitate flood-related damages and to address commodity price shocks on the
balance of payments and (ii) the current low level of international reserve coverage.
38.
Staff recommends that the next Article IV consultation with Lesotho be held on
the 24-month consultation cycle.

Appendix I: Kingdom of Lesotho: Letter of Intent

March 23, 2012

Ms. Christine Lagarde
Managing Director
International Monetary Fund
Washington, D.C. 20431
United States of America

Dear Ms. Lagarde,
This letter and the attached Memorandum of Economic and Financial Policies (MEFP)
update and supplement my communication of February 24, 2011; describe performance
under the government’s economic program, and outline the Government’s economic policies
and program for the remainder of 2011/12 and 2012/13.
Lesotho was hit by successive shocks that had a devastating effect on infrastructure, people
and Government fiscal operations. A sharp decline in SACU revenue of more than 50 percent
in 2010 was followed by devastating floods in early 2011, whose impact is estimated at about
M700 million (Seven Hundred Million Maloti) and has affected about 600,000 (Six Hundred
Thousand) people or 58 percent of the population. In response, the Government embarked on
a program of rehabilitation and fiscal consolidation aimed at rebuilding our reserves from the
current low level of three months of import cover to at least 5 months of coverage over the
medium term. In this regard, we are seeking external support, including additional financial
support from the IMF. Notwithstanding these severe shocks, we have been successfully
implementing economic and financial policy reforms which the Fund is supporting through a
three-year Extended Credit Facility (ECF) arrangement.
All performance criteria through end-March 2011 and end-September were met. Structural
reforms have progressed albeit with some delays. Five out of eight structural benchmarks
(SBs) due under the second and third reviews were implemented while the other three have
not yet been implemented. The new Financial Institutions Act has been passed by both
Houses of Parliament and is now in force, while the audit of domestic arrears (a benchmark
for March 2011) has been delayed and is now expected to be completed by March 2012.
This is due to the problems with the Integrated Financial Management Information System
(see Table 2 of the attached MEFP).
Regarding the National Strategic Development Plan (NSDP), I am pleased to inform you that
Cabinet has approved the NSDP subject to final editing and inclusion of a Foreword by The
Right Honourable The Prime Minister prior to printing. The NSDP describes the

33
Government’s strategy for high and sustainable growth, employment creation and poverty
reduction and covers the period 2012/13‒2016/17. We expect the NSDP to be used as a
basis for the Joint Staff Advisory Note (JSAN) jointly prepared by the staffs of the World
Bank and the IMF.
The NSDP is an outcome of the joint effort by all Basotho, the Government and
Development Partners who participated through working groups and public consultations. On
behalf of the Government of Lesotho, I would like to extend to you our gratitude for the
support of the Fund in the NSDP preparation process. We look forward to working with the
IMF in ensuring effective and full implementation of the NSDP. The NSDP will also be
posted on our website, http://www.gov.ls/. We have no objection to the publication of the
NSDP on the IMF website as well.
In view of the foregoing, the Government of Lesotho requests (i) the completion of the
second and third reviews, (ii) the augmentation of access to resources under the ECF
arrangement by an amount of SDR 8.73 million (equivalent to 25 percent of quota), and (iii)
disbursement of the third and fourth tranche under the arrangement, equivalent to SDR
20.085 million (57.6 percent of quota), which includes the proposed augmented amount.
Performance criteria and structural benchmarks for 2011-12 are included in Tables 1 and 3 of
the MEFP.
We continue to believe that the policies set forth in the attached MEFP are adequate to
achieve the objectives of the program, notwithstanding the new macroeconomic challenges
we face. The Government however, stands ready to take any further measures that may
become necessary to achieve our policy objectives. The government of Lesotho will consult
with the IMF—at its own initiative or whenever the Managing Director of the IMF requests
such a consultation—on the adoption of these measures and in advance of any revisions to
the policies contained in the MEFP. These consultations will be in accordance with the
IMF’s policies on such consultations.

Attachment 1: Kingdom of Lesotho: Memorandum of Economic and Financial Policies
for 2011/12–2012/13

I. INTRODUCTION AND BACKGROUND
1.
The Government of Lesotho firmly reiterates its commitment to the mediumterm economic program supported by the ECF arrangement. As laid out in the MEFP
dated February 24, 2011, our program aims at restoring fiscal and external sustainability,
while limiting the adverse impact of fiscal consolidation on the poor and vulnerable groups;
mitigating the impact of external shocks and achieving broad-based growth for sustained
poverty reduction; and strengthening the financial sector and the business climate.
2.

This memorandum:



Describes the recent economic developments, including the impact of the floods on
the economy in late 2010 and early 2011.



Reviews macroeconomic and financial performance under the ECF-supported
program through end-September 2011.



Updates the MEFP of February 24, 2011 and describes macroeconomic and financial
policies for the remainder of 2011/12 and 2012/13.
II. RECENT ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS

3.
Despite the significant drop in Southern African Customs Union (SACU)
revenues in 2010/11, we have made remarkable progress in economic reforms and
achieved large fiscal consolidation. The fiscal deficit for 2010/11 was reduced to 5 percent
of GDP,1 reflecting strong revenue performance including windfall SACU revenues2, a large
dividends payment from the Central Bank of Lesotho (CBL), and efforts to contain spending.
The core SACU fiscal balance3 improved significantly (by some 15 percent of GDP) from a
deficit of 20 percent of GDP in 2009/10 to a deficit of 5½ percent of GDP in 2010/11. This
1

This compared with original projection under the program of 19 percent of GDP, and budgeted deficit of 12.3
percent of GDP.
2

3

The SACU revenues received in 2010/11 were significantly larger than originally projected.

SACU revenues are separated into core component (equivalent to 15 percent of GDP being the lowest annual
receipt in the last two decades) and noncore component (the rest). The core fiscal balance is defined as the fiscal
balance excluding the noncore component of SACU revenues and the foreign project loans.

35
Bredaachievement in fiscal adjustment also helped to limit external imbalances, despite
rising international commodity prices. The level of reserves stood at $961 million at the end2010/11, much higher than the original program projection of $855 million.
4.
The floods in early 2011 caused widespread damages and loss of lives. According
to the 2011 Post Disaster Needs assessment (conducted jointly with Lesotho’s development
partners), 250,000 people (13.6 percent of the total population) were affected by the floods.
With heavy losses of crops and livestock, significant food imports were required.
Infrastructure damages (roads, water and sanitation) have also been significant. Under these
circumstances, we made budgetary provision in 2011/12 (2.2 percent of GDP) to cover some
of the costs of recovery and rehabilitation, some of which programs will carry over into
2012/13.
5.
A combination of the global food and oil price shock and the floods has taken a
heavy toll on our economy, requiring additional external assistance. Preliminary
estimates put the financial requirements for post-flood recovery and reconstruction at M649
million (about 3½ percent of GDP) for both public and private sectors. The reconstruction,
together with the surge in international commodity prices, also increased our import costs by
about 4 percent of GDP compared to what was projected when we embarked on the ECFsupported program. Thus far, our development partners have pledged US$2.8 million, of
which will be disbursed in 2012/13. We have been seeking further external support,
including the augmentation of the ECF arrangement.
6.
Lesotho’s medium-term macroeconomic prospects remain challenging despite a
modest growth recovery. Economic growth is expected to improve, with the expansion of
mining activities and the implementation of large infrastructure projects (including the
Metolong dam). At the same time, however, the current account deficit is expected to
increase in 2011/12 resulting from increased imports which will lead to further pressures on
international reserves. In the short-term, our main challenge is to sustain our fiscal
consolidation efforts while meeting our urgent reconstruction and development needs.
Looking forward, the uncertain global economic outlook is also a source of concern.
III. PERFORMANCE UNDER THE PROGRAM
7.
Overall performance under the ECF-supported program has been strong. All
quantitative performance criteria for end-March 2011 and end-September 2011 were met.
The indicative target for the floor on social spending was also met (Table 1).
8.
Structural reforms are also progressing, albeit with delays in some areas
(Table 2). In the financial sector, the implementation of the Financial Institutions Act will
pave the way for further strengthening of the supervisory and regulatory framework for
banks and non-bank financial institutions. A plan for capacity building in line ministries to

36
prepare medium-term expenditure frameworks (MTEF) has been produced; and work has
begun to prepare regulations for implementation of the National Lease Financing proposal,
consistent with the new Financial Institutions Act (FIA). The review of the Cooperatives
Societies Act and the launch of a partial credit guarantee scheme have been completed, albeit
with some delays. On the audit of domestic arrears, however, progress has been made
following the establishment of a task team in December 2011. On the front office revenue
receipting system, to ensure smooth introduction, the work has begun with three pilot
ministries and one sub-accountancy. The Industrial Licensing Bill has been drafted and
submitted to the Attorney General for approval.
IV. MACROECONOMIC POLICIES UNDER THE PROGRAM
9.
We remain committed to a fiscal consolidation program aimed at achieving a
sustainable fiscal and external position over the medium term while addressing our
development and social needs. In support of our exchange rate peg, significant fiscal
consolidation is called for to restore macroeconomic stability and preserve an adequate level
of international reserves. We continue to make efforts in cutting non-productive expenditures
while creating fiscal space for critical infrastructure projects and for support to vulnerable
groups. The current account imbalance is expected to narrow over the medium-term, in line
with fiscal consolidation, supported by strong performance in the mining sector. We expect
that the implementation of our medium-term policy framework will restore fiscal and
external sustainability.
10.
Over the medium-term, to achieve our objective of sustained economic growth as
the most effective route for poverty reduction, we will also make further efforts in
increasing Lesotho’s resilience to shocks and promoting private sector development. To
prepare for future shocks, we intend to gradually rebuild the international reserves buffer,
raising international reserves toward the equivalent of five months of imports. A public debt
management strategy will be formulated to support fiscal and debt sustainability. To achieve
sustained growth and increase employment, we will also promote private sector development
through enhancing access to credit and improving business climate. In this regard, the
government has committed to implementing a set of comprehensive reforms under the
National Strategic Development Plan (NSDP).
A. Macroeconomic Policies for the remainder of 2011/12
11.
We will make further progress in fiscal consolidation while securing floodrelated capital outlays. Despite the high costs of rehabilitation of flood-damaged
infrastructure (2.2 percent of GDP), included in the 2011/12 budget, we have maintained
tight limits on recurrent expenditure. As a result, the fiscal deficit is projected at 10½ percent
of GDP in 2011/12, even tighter than the adjustment program agreed to during the first
review, and compatible with restoring macroeconomic stability. To enhance the efficiency of

37
revenue administration, LRA has embarked on broadening the tax base by expanding the
taxpayer’s registration. In the event that fiscal revenue is better than expected, the available
resources will be used to build up our deposits at the CBL.
Seeking external financing
12.
High international commodity prices and the floods have created large financing
needs, for which we are seeking external support, including an augmentation of the
ECF arrangement in an amount equivalent to SDR 8.73 million (25 percent of quota).
High international fuel and food prices have added substantially to import costs, and the loss
of crops caused by the flooding has necessitated significant reconstruction and emergency
food imports (estimated at about US$60 million). To seek donor support, we presented our
case at an international disaster management conference in Geneva in May 2011. Operational
guidelines for the Disaster Risks Reduction Fund were prepared in November 2011, for
which the total of US$2.8 million has been pledged by UN Central Emergency Response,
UNDP, Ireland, People’s Republic of China, and OCHA. The fund will be operational in
2012/13.
13.
To ensure debt sustainability, the government will continue to seek external
financing through grants and concessional loans and save any unplanned inflows. As
agreed with the IMF, non-concessional financing will be limited to the European Investment
Bank loan for the Metolong Dam Project. In addition, we are assessing options for the
medium-term financing of the second phase of the Lesotho Highlands Water Project, which,
as an enclave project, is unlikely to be available on concessional terms.
B. Macroeconomic Policies for 2012/13 and beyond
14.
To achieve our medium-term objective of rebuilding international reserves in
support of the peg, we will maintain our adjustment efforts. While SACU revenues are
projected to increase, we will target a deficit limit in the core SACU fiscal balance of
8.6 percent of GDP for 2012/13. Accordingly, we intend to step up fiscal consolidation by (i)
freezing new positions (excluding those related to education, police and defense), (ii) keeping
civil servant wages constant in real terms, (iii) reducing non-priority outlays through stricter
expenditure control, and (iv) establishing strict guidelines to limit contingency spending to
emergencies. We remain committed to further containing recurrent expenditures, especially
spending on goods and services, while protecting spending for vulnerable groups and some
priority infrastructure and ensuring efficiency in public service delivery. On the revenue side,
we will undertake a full restructuring of the Lesotho Revenue Authority (LRA) in 2012/13,
including the operationalization of a full-service Large Tax Payer Unit by end-March 2013,
that will cater to medium-to-large taxpayers. The LRA continues to implement core business
processes and enforcement strategies designed to strengthen revenue collection, by
improving recovery of unpaid taxes, strengthening compliance and service delivery. In case

38
SACU revenues are higher than anticipated, the available resources will be used to build up
deposits at the CBL. If SACU revenues are projected to decline over the medium-term, we
will undertake offsetting measures to reduce spending on goods and services.
C. Structural Reforms
Public Financial Management
15.
PFM reforms will continue, with the support of our development partners, to
improve the efficiency of our budget process. Steady progress has been made, but
challenges remain, including problems with the functionality of IFMIS. Cash management
will be further strengthened through the establishment of the Cash Management Unit, and a
comprehensive inventory of all government accounts, including those at commercial banks,
will be undertaken by December 2012 (structural benchmark). By March 2012, we will start
implementing a front office revenue receipting system in three ministries and one subaccountancy, capturing all non-tax revenues from these pilot ministries in the IFMIS
(structural benchmark). Activities will also focus on further improvements in the
functionality of IFMIS, resolving interface and other IFMIS problems, and increasing staff
training in the use of the system.
16.
With a view to strengthening expenditure management, we will step up our
efforts to clear domestic arrears with assistance from our development partners.
Drawing upon the recommendations of an IMF technical assistance team, we have
formulated a time-bound audit plan with a view to completing an audit of domestic arrears by
March 2012 (structural benchmark). We have given instructions to line ministries to verify
the data in the system each month and to report any arrears on monthly basis. We intend to
modify a legal framework for allowing the recognition of electronic documents. This is
critical for expediting the government payments and the reconciliation of treasury and the
central bank accounts. We are also committed to preventing the emergence of new domestic
arrears in the future by implementing processes that ensure timely payments to suppliers.
Supporting financial sector development
17.
We have strengthened our legal framework to promote financial sector
development. Following the enactment of the new FIA in February 2012, a time-bound
action plan for its effective implementation has been prepared, and work is also underway to
prepare regulations for nonbank financial institutions by mid-2012. The FIA empowers the
CBL to deal effectively with unlawful business practices, including Ponzi schemes, and to
regulate and supervise nonbank financial institutions (money lenders, foreign exchange
bureau, and microfinance). In addition, by mid-2012, we plan on advancing the work to
modernize Postbank (e.g., mobile banking) and expand its services to the rural areas,

39
introducing the new Insurance law, and formulating the new pension and retirement fund
law.
Improving productivity and the investment climate
18.
We will continue to work closely with our development partners to implement
reforms that will facilitate private sector development and economic diversification. A
number of reforms aimed at improving the business environment have been implemented,
and several are underway. The Partial Credit Guarantee Scheme was launched in August
2011, with a view to allowing greater access to credit by small and medium enterprises. The
Companies Act 1967 has been reviewed and the new Companies Act 2011 will come into
operation by June 2012; the new Act introduces a short, simple and cost effective mechanism
for incorporation and registration of companies. The Trading Enterprise Regulations have
been amended, and published in December 2011, the amendment reduces the time required
to start a business by at least 14 days and while the Law used to require every business to
operate from business premises, the Regulations now allow some businesses (i.e.
consultancies) to operate from residences. Among the next steps, we intend to submit the
Industrial Licensing Bill to Parliament by end-September 2012 (structural benchmarks),
which would streamline the process of granting manufacturing/industrial licenses in a
transparent manner.
Poverty reduction strategy document
19.
A comprehensive five-year National Strategic Development Plan (NSDP)
(2012/13-2016/17) has been finalized with the support of our development partners, and
was submitted on March 23, 2012 to the IMF and the World Bank as a Poverty
Reduction Strategy document. The NSDP was prepared in a fully participatory manner
through comprehensive stakeholder consultation. The Government has set the objective of
enabling the private sector to create at least 50,000 sustainable jobs by the end of the Plan
period. To this end, we intend to increase private sector participation by significantly
reducing barriers to private investment and private sector development. Those barriers are: (i)
uncompetitive business environment, (ii) relatively poor infrastructure for trade facilitation
that also crowds out private investment, (iii) low productivity as a result of limited quality
technical skills, poor health mainly as a result of HIV and AIDS and low entrepreneurship
capacity and quality management and (iv) limited institutional capacity for regulatory and
policy reforms, investment and trade promotion and weak private sector organizations. To
address these problems, the NSDP sets its primary objectives as: (i) accelerating shared and
employment creating economic growth, (ii) developing infrastructure (Minimum
Infrastructure Platform), (iii) enhancing the skills base and foundation for innovation, (iv)
reversing environmental degradation and adapt to climate change, (v) improving health,

40
combat HIV and AIDS and reduce social vulnerability, and (vi) building effective institutions
and promote democratic governance.
20.
Under the NSDP, we are forecasting at real average GDP growth of 1.5 percent under
the low growth scenario, 5.8 percent under the moderate scenario and 6.7 percent under the
Plan scenario. For the purpose of the program and the budget, we maintain the conservative
assumption of average growth of 4.5 percent during 2012/13 and 2016/17.

V. PROGRAM ISSUES
Safeguards assessment
21.
We have made significant progress in implementing the recommendations of the
2010 safeguards assessment of the CBL. The assessment concluded that key elements of
the safeguards framework had been strengthened since the 2003 assessment, but also that
risks remained, in particular in the external audit mechanism. To address this, we appointed
Deloitte & Touche as sole auditor for the CBL’s annual accounts for the year ended
December 31, 2010. The audit was completed within the statutory deadline, and the audited
financial statements and audit opinion were posted on the bank’s external website in April
2011. The CBL has also introduced internal audits of monetary data to be submitted for
program monitoring purposes. We acknowledge that, should the access under the current
ECF arrangement be augmented, an updated safeguards assessment would need to be
completed. Deloitte & Touche (South Africa) has been reappointed to conduct the 2011
external audit jointly with a local firm. Both firms will sign the audit opinion. The 2011 audit
is underway and should be completed by end-March 2012.
Program monitoring
22.
Completion of the fourth, fifth and sixth reviews of the arrangement, by August
20, 2012 and February 20, 2013, and May 20, 2013, respectively, will be based on the
observance of quantitative performance criteria through end-March 2012, endSeptember 2012, and end-March 2013, respectively (Table 1). The targets for end-June
and end-December 2012 will be indicative. The definitions of the variables monitored as
quantitative performance criteria are provided in the Technical Memorandum of
Understanding (TMU).
23.
The Government is committed to ensuring that the program remains on track and will
continue to monitor implementation.

Attachment 2: Kingdom of Lesotho—Technical Memorandum of Understanding
1.
This memorandum sets forth the understandings between the government of Lesotho
and the IMF staff regarding the definitions of the quantitative performance criteria and
benchmarks for the second, third and fourth reviews of its arrangement under the ECFsupported program, as well as the respective reporting requirements. These performance
criteria and benchmarks are reported in Table 1 of the government’s Memorandum of
Economic and Financial Policies (MEFP).
A. Ceiling on the Domestic Financing Requirement (DFR) of the Central Government
2.
Definition. The central government includes the central administration and all district
administrations. The domestic financing requirement of the central government is defined
as net credit to the government from the banking system (that is, the Central Bank of Lesotho
and the commercial banks) plus holdings of treasury bills and other government securities by
the nonbank sector. For program monitoring purposes, the domestic financing requirement
will be calculated as the change from the end of the previous fiscal year (which runs from
April 1 to March 31) of net credit to the government by the banking system and of holdings
of treasury bills and other government securities by the nonbank sector. In particular, the
calculation of the domestic financing requirement shall include changes in (i) balances held
in the privatization account or balances of other accounts into which proceeds from the sale
of public enterprises are deposited; (ii) the amount of outstanding treasury bills issued by the
Central Bank of Lesotho for monetary policy purposes and held in the balance of the blocked
government deposit account used by the Central Bank of Lesotho to sterilize reserve money
absorbed by monetary policy operations. The calculation of the domestic financing
requirement shall exclude changes in balances held in any account into which revenues
collected by the customs department are held pending their transfer to the SACU revenues
pool. External debt service, amortization, disbursements and external grants will be
calculated at current exchange rates.
3.
Supporting material. The Central Bank of Lesotho will provide the monetary
survey and other monthly monetary statistics, as well as a table showing the details of all
government financing operations from the nonbank public, on a monthly basis and within
30 days of the end of the month. The following information will be presented as
memorandum items in the monetary survey: (i) the outstanding balances in the privatization
account or accounts; and (ii) details of any monetary operations with treasury bills, including
changes in government deposits as a result of such operations. The Central Bank of Lesotho
will also provide a table showing the details of government debt by type and holder. The
Ministry of Finance and Development Planning will provide detailed monthly budget
operation reports and tax arrears reports.

45
A. Ceiling on the Stock of Net Domestic Assets of the Central Bank of Lesotho
4.
Definition. The net domestic assets (NDA) of the Central Bank of Lesotho are
defined as the difference between reserve money (currency in circulation plus total bank
deposits at the central bank) and NFA (as defined in paragraph 5). For program monitoring
purposes, the NDA will be calculated as the change from the end of the previous fiscal year
(which runs from April 1 to March 31). The NDA thus includes net claims by the Central
Bank of Lesotho on the government (loans and treasury bills purchased less government
deposits), claims on banks, and “other items net” (other assets, other liabilities, and the
capital account).
5.
Definition. The net foreign assets (NFA) of the Central Bank of Lesotho are defined
as foreign assets minus foreign liabilities, and include all foreign claims and liabilities of the
central bank. The values of all foreign assets and liabilities will be calculated in U.S. dollars
at the end of each quarter using the program exchange rates.
6.
Supporting material. The Central Bank of Lesotho will provide detailed data on its
balance sheet on a monthly basis within 21 days of the end of the month. The central bank
will also provide a table of selected monetary indicators covering the major elements of its
balance sheet on a weekly basis.
B. Floor on the Stock of Net International Reserves of the Central Bank of Lesotho
7.
Definition. The net international reserves (NIR) are defined as the Central Bank of
Lesotho’s liquid, convertible foreign assets minus its short-term foreign liabilities. Pledged
or otherwise encumbered assets, including, but not limited to, assets used as collateral or
as guarantee for third-party external liabilities are excluded from reserve assets. Reserve
assets include cash and balances held with banks, bankers’ acceptances, investments,
foreign notes and coins held by the Central Bank of Lesotho, Lesotho’s reserve position in

Bank of Lesotho, use of IMF credit, and any other short term liabilities of the central bank to
nonresidents. The stock of NIR at the end of each quarter is defined in U.S. dollars and will
be calculated using the program exchange rates.1

C. Ceiling on the Amount of New Nonconcessional External Debt Contracted or
Guaranteed by the Public Sector, with Original Maturity of One Year or More
9.
Definition. For purposes of the ECF arrangement, concessionality requirements will
be applied to foreign-currency denominated debt regardless of the residency of the creditor.
The public sector comprises the central government, the Central Bank of Lesotho, and all
public enterprises and other official sector entities with majority state ownership. This
performance criterion applies not only to debt as defined in point No. 9 of the Guidelines on
Performance Criteria with Respect to External Debt in Fund Arrangements, adopted by
Decision No. 6230-(79/140), as revised on August 24, 2000, as amended effective December
1, 2009, but also to commitments contracted or guaranteed for which value has not been
received. Included in this performance criterion are all current liabilities that are created
under a contractual arrangement through the provision of value in the form of assets
(including currency) or services, and that require the public sector (obligor) to make one or
more payments in the form of assets (including currency) at some future point(s) in time to
discharge principal and/or interest liabilities incurred under the contract. In effect, all
instruments that share the characteristics of debt as described above (including loans,
suppliers’ credits, and leases) will be subject to the ceiling. New nonconcessional borrowing
is limited to the Metolong Dam Project, a high-return public investment project. The
performance criterion will be evaluated on a continuous basis as the cumulative change in the
amount of new nonconcessional debt contracted or guaranteed from end-March 2010
onward.
10.
Definition. A loan is concessional if its grant element is at least 35 percent of the
value of the loan, calculated using a discount rate based on commercial interest reference
rates (CIRRs) reported by the OECD. For loans of maturity of greater than 15 years, the grant
element will be based on the ten-year average of OECD CIRRs. For loans of maturity of
15 years or less, the grant element will be based on the six-month average of OECD CIRRs.
Margins for differing repayment periods would be added to the CIRRs: 0.75 percent for
repayment periods of less than 15 years, 1 percent for repayment periods of 15 to 19 years,
1.15 percent for repayment periods of 20 to 29 years, and 1.25 percent for repayment periods
of 30 years or more.
11.
Supporting material. Details of all new commitments and government guarantees
for external borrowing, with detailed explanations, will be provided by the Ministry of
Finance and Development Planning on a monthly basis within 30 days of the end of the
month.

47
D. Ceiling on the Amount of New External Debt Contracted or Guaranteed by the
Public Sector, with Original Maturity of Less than One Year
12.
Definition. The public sector comprises the central government, the Central Bank of
Lesotho, and all enterprises with majority state ownership. This performance criterion applies
not only to debt as defined in point No. 9 of the Guidelines on Performance Criteria with
Respect to External Debt in Fund Arrangements, adopted by Decision No. 6230-(79/140), as
revised on August 24, 2000, as amended effective December 1, 2009, but also to
commitments contracted or guaranteed for which value has not been received. Included in
this performance criterion are all current liabilities that are created under a contractual
arrangement through the provision of value in the form of assets (including currency) or
services, and that require the public sector (obligor) to make one or more payments in the
form of assets (including currency) at some future point(s) in time to discharge principal
and/or interest liabilities incurred under the contract. In effect, all instruments that share the
characteristics of debt as described above (including loans, suppliers’ credits, and leases) will
be subject to the ceiling. Excluded from this performance criterion are normal short-term
import credits. The performance criterion will be evaluated on a continuous basis as the
cumulative change in the amount of new nonconcessional debt contracted or guaranteed from
the end of the previous fiscal year (March 31).
13.
Supporting material. Details of all new commitments and government guarantees
for external borrowing, with detailed explanations, will be provided by the Ministry of
Finance and Development Planning on a monthly basis within 30 days of the end of the
month.
E. Ceiling on the Stock of External Payments Arrears
14.
Definition. During the period of the arrangement, the stock of external payments
arrears of the public sector (central government, Central Bank of Lesotho, and all enterprises
with majority state ownership) will continually remain zero. Arrears on external debt-service
obligations include any nonpayment of interest and/or principal in full and on time falling
due to all creditors, including the IMF and the World Bank.
15.
Supporting material. Details of arrears accumulated on interest and principal
payments to creditors will be reported within one week from the date of the missed payment.
F. Floor on the Central Government Social Expenditures
16.
Definition: There will be a floor on the central government social expenditures from
domestic resources. The observance of this floor is an indicative target. Social expenditures
comprise spending on the following: school feeding program, old age pension, African Pioneer
Corps and HIV/AIDS.

48
Supporting material: Data on social spending will be compiled by the Ministry of
17.
Finance and Development Planning and will be provided on a quarterly basis, to be
submitted no later than six weeks after the end of each reporting period.

G. Adjusters

VII. Safeguards Assessment
An updated safeguards assessment under the 2010 ECF arrangement was completed on
December 27, 2010. The CBL has made good progress in implementing the
recommendations of the safeguards assessment. Deloitte and Touche (South Africa)
was appointed as the CBL’s external auditor in 2010. The audit of that year was
completed within the statutory deadline and the audited financial statements were
published in full on the bank’s external website in April 2011. Deloitte & Touche
(South Africa) has been reappointed to conduct the 2011 external audit jointly with a
local audit firm. Both firms will sign the audit opinion. It is expected that the audit will
be completed by end-March 2012. As recommended by the assessment, the CBL has
also introduced internal audits of the monetary data submitted for program monitoring
purposes. The authorities are aware that in the event of an augmentation of the existing
arrangement, an update assessment will need to be completed.
VIII. Exchange arrangement:
Lesotho is a member of the Common Monetary Area (CMA) and the Lesotho loti is
both de facto and de jure pegged at par to the South African Rand, which is also legal
tender in the country. Lesotho has accepted the obligations of Article VIII, Sections 2,
3, and 4, of the Articles of Agreement and maintains an exchange system free of
restrictions on the making of payments and transfers for current international
transactions. As of February 29, 2012, the maloti rate per U.S. dollar was M7.44.
IX. Article IV consultation:
The 2009 Article IV consultation was concluded by the Executive Board on February
22, 2010. Lesotho is on the standard 24-month Article IV consultation cycle.

III. LESOTHO: STATISTICAL ISSUES
The statistical database is adequate for surveillance, although there are some
deficiencies in core surveillance data, including government finance, monetary and
financial statistic and balance of payments statistics that are currently being addressed
by the authorities.
As one of 22 countries participating in the GDDS Project for Anglophone African Countries
(funded by the U.K. Department for International Development (DFID)), Lesotho has
undertaken the GDDS as framework for the development of its national statistical system and
a depository of metadata for main macroeconomic aggregates. GDDS metadata have been
posted on the Fund’s Dissemination Standards Bulletin Board since August 2003. Pending
metadata updates in GDDS include those referring to recent/prospective revisions of the
national accounts, government finance, and balance of payments statistics.
National accounts
Revised and rebased national accounts were released in November 2008 by the Lesotho
Bureau of Statistics of Lesotho (BOS). Technical assistance from the EU and DFID
supported the data revision and the rebasing of the GDP data from 1981 to 2007. Additional
revisions and modifications were made in 2009, some due to revisions in the balance of
payments. Important new sources of data include the use of VAT records and the 2008 labor
force survey. Annual GDP estimates in current prices and volume terms from the production,
expenditure, and income sides are currently being produced and published by the BLS, albeit
with different time lags. Other macroeconomic indicators, such as high-frequency industrial
production/trade indices, are used to monitor developments during the year.
There is a need to further improve the source data used for compiling national
accounts. Pending challenges include, inter alia, robust data on intermediate consumption for
key economic activities, intra-SACU exports and imports, and gross fixed capital formation
in machinery and equipment, and formal and informal construction activities. Private
consumption and gross fixed capital formation are now estimated within the framework of a
supply and use table. However, it has not been possible to balance supply and use
completely, hence the remaining discrepancy between the tables on GDP by activity and
expenditure.
Prices
The consumer price index (CPI) has been revised and the new base period is March
2010. The CPI is estimated on a monthly basis by the BOS and is designated to show
changes in the cost of buying a fixed bundle of consumer goods and services as determined
for the base period using spending weights from the 2002/03 Household Budget Survey
(HBS). Prices are collected every month in twelve urban towns and forty five selected rural
areas of Lesotho by personal visits to outlets.

8
Plans are in place at the BOS to develop producer and export price indices. In the
meantime, the national accounts rely heavily on the South African producer price index
(PPI), which is used as a deflator for imports from SACU member countries. South Africa’s
import price indices are used as deflators for imports from non-SACU countries.
Government finance statistics
Data on government finance statistics are provided by the Ministry of Finance and
Development Planning (MoFDP) to AFR periodically, and the timeliness and quality of
the data have improved. Technical assistance from STA and the Development and
Implementation of a Macroeconomic Model for Lesotho project (DIMMOL) supported
migration of data from GFSM 1986 to the GFSM 2001 framework. AFR has been provided
with monthly, quarterly and annual disaggregated central government data (on a cash basis)
using the GFSM 2001 framework. These statistics were compiled from the Integrated
Financial Management Information System (IFMIS), supplemented with data from the
Lesotho Revenue Authority (LRA), other government departments and units and the banking
system.
The Integrated Financial Management Information System (IFMIS), introduced in
April 2009, and which has modules consistent with the GFSM 2001 framework, is now
the main source of government finance statistics. However, as a result of teething
problems experienced with the IFMIS, there has been inadequate data capture of revenues
and budget execution data, and therefore shortcomings to the data to prepare the budget.
Steady progress has been made, with technical assistance from the EU and FAD, to improve
the functionality of the IFMIS. To ensure timely reconciliation of and monitoring of budget
execution, further improvements are needed, including improving revenue tracking and
ensuring proper reconciliation and adequate quality check of data from line ministries and
government units. The authorities have integrated the government payroll system (Unique,
implemented in September 2009) and the CS-DRMS - the public debt recording and
management system -with the IFMIS, and are working to integrate the LRA system – the
VIPS. There are also plans to interface IFMIS with the CBL.
The MoFDP also provides annual data to STA on the operations of the general
government for publication in the Government Finance Statistics Yearbook. No high
frequency data are reported for publication in the International Financial Statistics. The
MoFDP disseminates government finance statistics, including government debt, to the public
through its website and the website of the Bureau of Statistics.
Monetary and financial statistics
Lesotho compiles and reports monetary statistics based on the Standardized Report
Forms (SRFs). Monthly data using SRFs are disseminated in the IFS. Beginning in January

9
2011, data are based on improved sources which allow for better classification and
sectorization of accounts closely aligned to the MFSM methodology.
The authorities need to expand the institutional coverage of MFS with respect to both
full coverage of other depository corporations and expanding the coverage to include
other financial corporations. A monetary and financial statistics mission in May 2011
found that the progress has been very slow in expanding the coverage of monetary statistics
mainly because of weaknesses in or nonexistence of reporting frameworks for the financial
institutions in question and lack of staff resources to devote to this task.
Balance of payments and external debt
In 2010, the CBL adopted a new balance of payments database, developed as part of a
DIMMOL project to develop an integrated and consistent set of sector flow-of-funds
accounts. The development of the external sector account, which began in 2008, benefited
from technical assistance from STA. The new database addresses a number of data and
methodological classification issues, including the treatment of SACU transfers. The new
database provides an opportunity to improve the format of the quarterly and annual balance
of payments statements published by the CBL.
Most of the recommendations made by the 2008 STA mission for improving the quality
of balance of payments statistics have been implemented in the new database. A STA
mission in April/May 2010 reviewed the balance of payments database and confirmed that it
is consistent with the standard presentation recommended by the Balance of Payments
Manual, fifth edition (BPM5) and that it meets the need of both the balance of payments and
the external accounts. The mission welcomed the work of the DIMMOL, which enables
access to other sector accounts, such as fiscal and national accounts, providing data sources
that supplement data entered directly into the balance of payments database by the CBL.
Following from the 2008 recommendations, private capital flows surveys have become an
annual survey and the reports published. The 2008 recommendations for expanding the
coverage of International Investment Position (IIP) statistics have not yet been implemented.
The mission emphasized the need for staff training to manage the new database;
adoption of the new balance of payments database as the official source; and expansion
of IIP coverage to reflect available data sources. On dissemination practices, the mission
urged the authorities to publish balance of payments and IIP data consistent with BPM5 in
the CBL’s Annual Report and Quarterly Review and post the balance of payments and IIP
data at the CBL website on a quarterly basis.
Data on public sector external debt is provided by the MoFDP. The MoFDP maintains a
comprehensive database of outstanding loans, with information on currency composition,
debt service and amortization, as well as scheduled future disbursements and debt servicing.

INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND AND
INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION
KINGDOM OF LESOTHO
Joint World Bank/IMF Debt Sustainability Analysis
Prepared by the staffs of the International Monetary Fund and
the International Development Association
March 23, 2012
Lesotho remains at moderate risk of debt distress. The remittance modified indicators
remains below indicative targets under the baseline. Debt ratios are projected to remain
manageable over the medium-term as Southern African Customs Union (SACU) revenues
recover and the fiscal position improves.1 As a small open economy, Lesotho remains
vulnerable to adverse global or regional shocks affecting the exchange rate or real GDP
growth as well as export growth and nondebt creating flows. The risks appear manageable
over the medium-term if the authorities are able to move forward with the planned fiscal
adjustment in coming years. The results of this analysis underscore the critical need to
realign spending with its sustainable level based on the expected long-run level of SACU
revenues, while moving forward with structural reforms to boost productivity and
competitiveness in order to accelerate medium-term growth.
I. INTRODUCTION
1.
This DSA has been prepared jointly by IMF and World Bank staff. It comprises
external and domestic debt, and is based on the framework for low-income countries
approved by the respective Executive Boards.2 The framework takes into account indicative
thresholds for debt burden indicators determined by the quality of the country’s policies and
institutions,3 and comprises baseline and alternative scenarios. Given the importance of
1

The analysis has been carried out on fiscal rather than calendar year basis. The fiscal year (FY) starts on
April 1st. The analysis does not include state owned enterprise debt.

The World Bank Country Policy and Institutional Assessment has ranked Lesotho using the three-year moving
average as a “medium performer” in terms of policy and institutions with a rating of 3.4. The applicable
indicative thresholds for debt sustainability, proposed under the framework for low-income countries are:
(i) 40 percent for the NPV of debt-to-GDP ratio, (ii) 150 percent for NPV of debt-to-exports ratio;
(iii) 250 percent for the NPV of debt-to-fiscal revenues ratio; (iv) 20 percent for the debt service to exports
ratio; and (v) 30 percent for the debt service to revenue ratio.

2
remittances4 in enhancing Lesotho’s capacity to repay debt, the DSA also uses the
remittance-modified debt indicators to assess the risk of debt distress.5
2.
Lesotho’s public sector debt declined from 50.6 percent of GDP in 2008/09 to
35.2 percent at end-2010/11, driven mainly by significant appreciation of the
Loti/Dollar exchange rate for 2009 and 2010. Of the total public sector debt,
US$730 million was owed to external creditors, almost entirely to multilaterals
(US$655 million), mainly IDA and the African Development Fund. Public domestic debt
(held by residents) amounted to US$116 million at the end of 2010/11. At present, domestic
debt is composed of Treasury Bills and Treasury Bonds.

The large decline in SACU revenues in 2010/11 (equivalent to about 17 percent
of GDP) had a significant impact on Lesotho’s external and fiscal positions. While the
level of SACU transfers is expected to increase as the South African economy recovers, it is
unlikely to return to the very high levels (relative to GDP) recorded in recent years. In
addition, there is considerable uncertainty regarding the level of SACU revenues over the
longer term, with the possibility of revisions to the revenue-sharing formula.

The definition of remittances has been revised based on a more detailed BOP framework compared to the one
that was used for the previous DSA in May 2010. The revision resulted in lower values both for past years and
the projections.

See “Applying the Debt Sustainability Framework for low-Income Countries Post Debt Relief,”
(IDA/SecM2006-0564 and SM/07/131) and “Staff Guidance Note on the Application of the Joint Fund-Bank
Debt Sustainability Framework for Low-Income Countries,”
http://www.imf.org/external/np/pp/eng/2010/012210.pdf. The last DSA prepared in May 2010 also used
remittance-modified debt indicators.

4.
The impact of the decline in SACU revenues on gross debt has been mitigated by
fiscal adjustment and the withdrawal of government deposits at the Central Bank of
Lesotho (CBL). Adjustment policies are being implemented under an ECF arrangement as a
means of dealing with the decline in SACU revenues (see staff report of the 2nd review of the
ECF arrangement). Having run a fiscal surplus until 2008/09, the government accumulated
deposits in the magnitude of 4.5 billion Maloti at the CBL by 2008/09. The government
deposits have since been partly withdrawn, reaching 3.4 billion Maloti by September 2011.
The government is expected to begin accumulating deposits again by the second quarter of
2012 on the basis of the implementation of the planned fiscal adjustment.
II. MACROECONOMIC ASSUMPTIONS
5.
The baseline scenario below is based on the following macroeconomic projections
and assumptions. Compared with the May 2010 DSA, this DSA assumes weaker recovery
after the global crisis and higher inflation pressures due to rising international commodity
prices. Moreover, the DSA takes into account the strong appreciation of the Loti during the
second half of 2010 which lowered the value of foreign denominated debt.

6



Output growth reached 3.6 percent in 2009/10, 5.7 percent in 2010/11, and is
projected to reach 4.2 percent in 2011/12. Between 2011/12 and 2016/17, growth
is expected to average about 4.5 percent of GDP, before increasing to 5 percent
between 2017/18 to 2031/32, boosted by the construction of the Metolong dam
and the impact of the Lesotho Highlands Water Project, Phase II (LHWP2). The
prospect for medium-term growth is favorable, given prospective mining sector
investment and assuming that the construction of the Metolong Dam and LHWP2
will allow Lesotho to become an important exporter of water and electricity in the
region and put the country in an improved position for attracting FDI.



Inflation (as measured by the implicit GDP deflator) is assumed to move from an
average of 7.4 percent over the last ten years (elevated in part by the food and
energy price shocks in 2007–08) to 6.4 percent between 2011/12 and 2016/17, in
line with projected consumer price inflation in South Africa. In the longer term,
inflation in both Lesotho and South Africa is projected to average 5 percent.



Fiscal performance in 2010/11 was stronger than envisaged under the original
program, reflecting strong revenue performance, boosted by windfall revenues6
and a large dividend payment by the CBL as well as containment of expenditure.
SACU payments are expected to recover to 29 percent of GDP in 2012/13, before

Notwithstanding the large decline in annual SACU payments equivalent to 19.5 percent of GDP in 2011/12,
Lesotho received M466.6 million in SACU revenue after tribunal settlement at the Hague of a dispute between
South Africa and BLNS over costs incurred in 2006/07–2007/08.

stabilizing around 20 percent of GDP in the medium term. The fiscal deficit
reached 5 percent of GDP in 2010/11 and is projected at 10.5 percent of GDP for
2011/12. The deficit is expected to diminish gradually with the government
achieving a surplus of 4.3 percent in 2016/17. In the longer term, staff expects
zero net domestic borrowing (constant roll-over of existing debt, as the
government envisages a fiscal balance in the medium to long-term) and net
external borrowing in the magnitude of 1 percent of GDP per year (excluding
borrowing for LHWP2 amounting to about 5 percent of GDP between 2017/18
and 2019/20).7


The external current account position deteriorated to an estimated deficit of
14.8 percent of GDP in 2010/11, due to the sharp drop in SACU revenues and a
widening of the trade balance deficit. The deficit is expected to increase to
16.6 percent in 2011/12 and then narrow over the medium term, supported by
strong export performance in the mining sector and slow import growth as a result
of fiscal adjustment. The current account is expected to be about balanced by
2016/17 and to be close to balance in the longer term. Reserve coverage is
projected to stabilize at about 6 months of imports of goods and services in the
long run.
III. EXTERNAL DEBT SUSTAINABILITY

Baseline
6.
Lesotho’s PV of external debt stood at 32.2 percent of GDP at end-2010/11 and is
projected to rise to 39 percent by 2020/21 (Table 1a). This increase is driven
predominantly by nonconcessional borrowing for the Metolong dam and LHWP2. The PV of
external debt is thus projected to remain below the 40 percent indicative threshold, and to
decline thereafter to 25.9 percent in 2031/32. The significant decline in the PV of external
debt after 2021/22 is driven partly by the large swing in the grant element of external debt
after the amortization of project loans for LHWP2 and Metolong, both of which are assumed
to be on commercial terms.
7.
The PV of external debt relative to exports and to revenues would also rise
through 2020/21, but remain well below the respective indicative thresholds of 150 and
250 percent. The ratio of debt service to exports is expected to remain stable around
3-4 percent of GDP between 2010/11 and 2031/32; the ratio of debt service to revenues

7

The construction of both the Metolong Dam and LHWP2 are expected to result in higher tax and export
revenues.

5
increases from 3.6 to 5.7 percent of GDP in 2031/32. Both ratios would remain well below
the thresholds due to the highly concessional nature of existing debt.8
Alternative scenarios and stress tests
8.
Sensitivity tests show that Lesotho’s debt burden would increase in the event of
less favorable public sector borrowing terms (Table 1b). In a scenario in which the
interest rate on new public sector loans is 2 percentage points higher than the baseline
assumption (scenario A2), the PV of debt-to-GDP ratio reaches 43 percent in 2021/22 and
falls to 35 percent by 2031/32. The stress tests result in a large and sustained breach of the
debt-to-GDP threshold. In a scenario in which the key variables are set at their average of the
past 10 years, Lesotho’s debt ratios actually fall relative to the baseline, reflecting the
average fiscal surplus over this period relative to the significant deterioration in the fiscal
position in the projection. However, given the structural break, the historical scenario could
be considered less relevant for the analysis.
9.
Bound tests reveal that Lesotho would face most distress in the event of a
nominal exchange rate depreciation or if net nondebt creating flows turned out lower
than the historical average. In a scenario with net nondebt creating flows9 one standard
deviation lower than the historical average, the PV of debt-to-GDP ratio would increase to
56 percent by 2021/22 and then ease to 31 percent in 2031/32. In the event of a one-time
30 percent depreciation of the nominal exchange rate (B6), the PV of debt-to-GDP ratio
would similarly increase to 51 percent by 2021/22, but then fall to 35 percent by 2031/32.
The indicative threshold of 40 percent would also temporarily be breached in case that the
US dollar GDP deflator or export value growth turned out lower than the historical average.
The same holds for a combined shock including lower GDP growth and lower nondebt
creating flows compared to the historical average.
IV. PUBLIC SECTOR DEBT SUSTAINABILITY
Baseline
10.
Domestic debt remained relatively low at the end of 2010/11 (4.8 percent of
GDP), leaving public debt indicators very closely aligned to those of public external
debt (Table 2a). Domestic debt currently comprises Treasury bonds (since 2010/11) and
Treasury bills. Domestic debt is projected to fall to 4.2 percent of GDP by 2016/17, and then
to gradually fall to 1 percent of GDP in 2031/32. This fall reflects the assumption of zero net
domestic borrowing after 2016/17.
8

Borrowing associated with LHWP2 is not assumed to be on concessional terms, resulting in a decline in the
overall grant element of borrowing between 2013 and 2019.

9

Nondebt creating flows include official and private transfers as well as FDI.

6
Alternative scenarios and stress tests
11.
In the standard sensitivity tests, public sector debt ratios are most sensitive to an
unchanged primary balance from 2011/12 (Table 2b and Figure 2b). This scenario
assumes an unchanged primary balance from 2011/12 onwards, the year in which the country
is projected to incur a fiscal deficit of 10.5 percent of GDP and a current account deficit of
16.6 percent of GDP. The scenario results in the PV of debt to GDP rising to 127 percent in
2021/22 and 164 percent in 2031/32. Lower long-run real GDP growth results in the PV of
debt to GDP ratio rising to 46 percent in 2021/22 and 47 percent by 2031/32, compared with
27 percent in the baseline scenario in 2031/32. The latter scenario illustrates the vulnerability
of the debt trajectory in the event that the ongoing program of infrastructure investment and
structural reforms fails to generate sufficient improvement in productivity and
competitiveness needed to support the higher real GDP growth rates projected over the
medium-term.
V. CONCLUSION
12.
Lesotho remains at moderate risk of debt distress. The PV of public debt as a ratio
to GDP is projected to remain just below the indicative threshold of 40 percent in the
baseline scenario. The ratio is projected to decline thereafter as the fiscal remains stable at a
small deficit after 2016/17. The ratio also lies below the indicative threshold by the end of
the projection period in 2031/32. However, the risk of debt distress is magnified as stress
tests result in a protracted breach of indicative thresholds. It increases significantly in the
event of adverse shocks to economic growth, significant exchange rate depreciation, or a
fiscal balance significantly worse than expected. The risks appear manageable over the
medium-term if the authorities are able to move forward with the planned fiscal adjustment
in coming years. The results of this analysis underscore the critical need to realign spending
with its sustainable level based on the expected long-run level of SACU revenues, while
moving forward with structural reforms to boost productivity and competitiveness in order to
accelerate medium-term growth.
13.
The authorities broadly agreed with the assessment of moderate risk of debt
distress. The authorities appreciated that the PV of external debt ratio comes close to
breaching the indicative threshold temporarily in 2020/21, partly due to the construction of
the Metolong dam and the impact of the LHWP2. They agreed that the risk of debt distress
increases significantly in the event of adverse shocks as well as with the need to realign
spending with its sustainable level based on the expected long-run level of SACU revenues,
while moving forward with structural reforms to boost productivity and competitiveness in
order to accelerate medium-term growth.

1/ Includes both public and private sector external debt.
2/ Derived as [r - g - ρ(1+g)]/(1+g+ρ+gρ) times previous period debt ratio, with r = nominal interest rate; g = real GDP growth rate, and ρ = growth rate of GDP deflator in U.S. dollar terms.
3/ Includes exceptional financing (i.e., changes in arrears and debt relief); changes in gross foreign assets; and valuation adjustments. For projections also includes contribution from price and exchange rate changes.
4/ Assumes that PV of private sector debt is equivalent to its face value.
5/ Current-year interest payments divided by previous period debt stock.
6/ Historical averages and standard deviations are generally derived over the past 10 years, subject to data availability.
7/ Defined as grants, concessional loans, and debt relief.
8/ Grant-equivalent financing includes grants provided directly to the government and through new borrowing (difference between the face value and the PV of new debt).

Sources: Country authorities; and staff estimates and projections.
1/ Variables include real GDP growth, growth of GDP deflator (in U.S. dollar terms), non-interest current account in percent of GDP, and non-debt creating flows.
2/ Assumes that the interest rate on new borrowing is by 2 percentage points higher than in the baseline., while grace and maturity periods are the same as in the baseline.
3/ Exports values are assumed to remain permanently at the lower level, but the current account as a share of GDP is assumed to return to its baseline level after the shock (implicitly assuming
an offsetting adjustment in import levels).
4/ Includes official and private transfers and FDI.
5/ Depreciation is defined as percentage decline in dollar/local currency rate, such that it never exceeds 100 percent.
6/ Applies to all stress scenarios except for A2 (less favorable financing) in which the terms on all new financing are as specified in footnote 2.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

International Monetary Fund
700 19th Street, NW
Washington, D. C. 20431 USA

IMF Executive Board Concludes 2012 Article IV Consultation with the
Kingdom of Lesotho
On April 9, 2012, the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) concluded the
Article IV consultation with Lesotho.1
Background
Despite the unfavorable external environment (owing to a significant fall in revenues from the
Southern African Customs Union (SACU) and floods in early 2011), Lesotho’s real gross
domestic product (GDP) grew at 5¾ percent in 2010/11 and is projected to increase by
4¼ percent in 2011/12, mainly driven by the mining and construction sectors. Meanwhile,
inflation steadily increased in 2011, reaching 7 percent in December, reflecting high
international commodity prices and agricultural shortages following months of floods. The
external balances remained under pressure from the fall in SACU revenues and the floods, as
well as from recent high international commodity prices. The external current account deficit
widened to 14¾ percent of GDP in 2010/11, while gross international reserves fell to about four
months of imports by end-2011. A new five-year National Strategic Development Plan (covering
2012/13–2016/17)—with a view to achieving sustained growth and poverty reduction—was
recently finalized.
In 2010/11–2011/12, significant fiscal consolidation efforts were made to address the drop in
SACU revenues. Increased domestic revenue collections and cuts in recurrent spending
improved the fiscal position. The core SACU fiscal balance—defined as the fiscal balance
excluding the volatile component of SACU revenues and foreign-financed project loans—
recorded a deficit of 5½ percent of GDP in 2010/11 and is projected at 7¾ percent in 2011/12,
1

Under Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement, the IMF holds bilateral discussions with
members, usually every year. A staff team visits the country, collects economic and financial
information, and discusses with officials the country's economic developments and policies. On
return to headquarters, the staff prepares a report, which forms the basis for discussion by the
Executive Board. At the conclusion of the discussion, the Managing Director, as Chairman of the
Board, summarizes the views of Executive Directors, and this summary is transmitted to the
country's authorities. An explanation of any qualifiers used in summing up can be found here:
http://www.imf.org/external/np/sec/misc/qualifiers.htm.

significantly below the 20 percent of GDP recorded in 2009/10. The authorities have committed
to maintaining the fiscal consolidation efforts in 2012/13. The risk of debt distress remains
moderate, despite an increase in public debt in 2011/12 on account of loans for large
infrastructure projects.
Although the banking sector has been well regulated and supervised, nonbank financial
institutions were generally not comprehensively supervised. The weakness in the regulatory and
supervisory framework has been addressed through the adoption of the new Financial
Institutions Act, which will guide all aspects of regulation and supervision of both bank and
nonbank financial institutions.
Lesotho’s medium-term economic outlook is favorable though clouded by significant downside
risks, given global economic uncertainties. Lesotho therefore faces the risk of unexpected fall in
SACU revenues and in global demand for diamonds. In addition, medium-term growth
prospects critically depend on ongoing reforms to improve the business environment and to
upgrade the physical infrastructure, to support sustained economic growth and diversification.
Executive Board Assessment
Executive Directors commended the authorities for the strong implementation of the
ECF-supported program, despite devastating floods and a difficult external environment.
Directors welcomed the authorities’ plans to strengthen Lesotho’s fiscal and external positions,
achieve broad-based growth for poverty reduction, and strengthen the supervisory and
regulatory frameworks for the financial sector.
Directors commended the authorities for their commitment to fiscal prudence, and underscored
the importance of continued fiscal consolidation to rebuild international reserves, support the
exchange rate peg, and reduce reliance on revenues from the Southern African Customs Union.
In this regard, greater revenues from the mining sector could be considered. Directors
welcomed the 2012/13 fiscal framework target of an overall surplus, with the underlying
measures to restrain recurrent outlays, while safeguarding critical social spending. More
broadly, they looked forward to further steps to strengthen public financial management,
improve the quality of public expenditure, and boost revenue mobilization. While Lesotho
remains at a moderate risk of debt distress, Directors encouraged the authorities to limit
non-concessional borrowing to safeguard debt sustainability.
Directors welcomed the progress in strengthening the supervisory and regulatory frameworks
for banks and nonbanks, and encouraged further steps in this direction. They also commended
the authorities for improvements in the anti-money-laundering framework and the steps
underway to increase access to financial services, especially in the rural areas.
Directors stressed the need to accelerate structural reforms to improve the investment climate
and competitiveness with a view to supporting private sector-led growth, economic
diversification, and poverty reduction. In this regard, they welcomed the finalization of the
National Strategic Development Plan.

IMF Executive Board Completes Second and Third Reviews Under Extended Credit
Facility Arrangement for the Kingdom of Lesotho, and Approves Request for
Augmentation of Access and US$13.42 Million Disbursement
The Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) today completed the second
and third reviews of the Kingdom of Lesotho's economic performance under a program
supported by the Extended Credit Facility (ECF) arrangement. The Board also approved an
augmentation of access equal to 25 percent of quota, which would lead to a total access of
145 percent of quota, an amount equivalent to SDR 50.605 million (about US$77.84
million), under the ECF arrangement. The Board's decision will enable an immediate
disbursement of an amount equivalent to SDR 20.085 million (US$30.89 million), bringing
total disbursements under the arrangement to an amount equivalent to SDR 33.565 million
(US$51.63).
The three-year ECF arrangement for the Kingdom of Lesotho in an amount of SDR 41.9
million was approved by the IMF’s Executive Board on June 2, 2010 (see Press Release No.
10/224).
Following the Executive Board’s discussion on Lesotho, Mr. Min Zhu, Deputy Managing
Director and Acting Chair, issued the following statement:
“Lesotho’s economy has performed well under the ECF-supported program, notwithstanding
a sharp reduction in SACU revenues, devastating floods, and high international commodity
prices. Stronger fiscal adjustment efforts and an acceleration of structural reforms are now
needed to restore fiscal and external sustainability and pave the way for sustained economic
growth and poverty reduction. The augmentation of access under the ECF-supported
program, supplemented by donor assistance, will further support the authorities’ reform
agenda and cushion the impact of the shocks on the balance of payments.
“Given the desirability of maintaining the exchange rate peg, the authorities’ medium-term
economic program appropriately focuses on fiscal adjustments to rebuild international
reserves. The prudent fiscal stance for 2012/13, with emphasis on curbing recurrent

2

expenditures while protecting social spending, is an important step in this direction. The
efficiency of spending will also be enhanced by improvements in public financial
management and the quality of capital spending, while strengthening tax administration will
help the achievement of the authorities’ medium-term fiscal targets.
“The authorities are committed to accelerating structural reforms to support private sector-led
growth and economic diversification. These reforms are aimed at improving the business
climate and boosting external competitiveness.
“Lesotho’s financial system has remained resilient, and planned regulatory reforms will
further strengthen the sector and facilitate financial deepening. Key measures include
adopting regulations for the recently enacted Financial Institutions Act, reinforcing the
supervisory role of the central bank and broadening access to financial services, especially in
the rural areas,” Mr. Zhu added.

Statement by Mr. Majoro on Kingdom of Lesotho
April 9, 2012
Introduction
My Lesotho authorities highly appreciate the support from staff, management and the Executive
Board in their efforts to foster socio-economic development and macroeconomic stability. They
value the constructive policy discussions with staff in addressing the challenges to sustainable
economic growth, employment creation and poverty reduction. Since the approval of the
Extended Credit Facility (ECF) arrangement in June 2010, Lesotho has continued to experience
destabilizing exogenous shocks. Following a sharp reduction in government revenue from the
Southern African Customs Union (SACU) in 2010/11, the country was hit by floods at the
beginning of 2011. In response, the authorities maintained their commitment to fiscal
consolidation, but were also confronted with the need to import emergency food and repair
damaged infrastructure. As a result, Lesotho’s fiscal and external positions remained under
considerable pressure. Despite these pressures, Lesotho has maintained prudent macroeconomic
policies, supported by the ECF arrangement. My authorities broadly agree with the thrust of the
staff report, as it sufficiently presents a balanced assessment of Lesotho’s recent macroeconomic
developments and outlook, policy achievements, opportunities and inherent challenges.
Program performance
Despite the exogenous shocks, my Lesotho authorities have maintained strong commitment to
the implementation of the policies outlined under the ECF program. All quantitative
performance criteria for end-March 2011 and end-September 2011 were met. For the same
period, the indicative target for the floor on social spending was met. Moreover, structural
reforms remained largely on track, even though delays were experienced in some areas.
Specifically, three structural benchmarks for end-March and end-June 2011 have been
implemented as programmed. In contrast, two benchmarks were met with delays while three
have been postponed, but remain a priority for implementation. Against this background, my
authorities are requesting the completion of the second and third reviews; and the augmentation
of access to resources amounting to SDR8.73 million.
Recent economic developments
Notwithstanding the uncertain external environment, Lesotho’s macroeconomic conditions
remained positive during 2010/11 and 2011/12. Output growth averaged 5.0 per cent, driven
mainly by construction, mining and manufacturing subsectors. Construction was significantly
influenced by activity related to the construction of the Metolong Dam and the Millennium
Challenge Compact. In the meantime, mining output benefited from strong international demand
for diamonds and the expansion of mining operations. Furthermore, manufacturing recovered in
2010/11, from the impact of the global financial crisis, as the share of exports to other SACU
countries grew noticeably.
Although macroeconomic conditions generally improved, the fiscal and balance of payments
positions remained under pressure from sharply reduced SACU revenue during 2010/11 and
1

2011/12. Even with these pressures, fiscal operations yielded much smaller deficits than
programmed under the ECF as a result of improved collection of domestic revenue and reduced
government expenditure. However, strong growth in imports supplemented the steep drop in
external revenues to amplify the deterioration in the balance of payments position. As a result,
the country’s international reserves fell to approximately 4 months of import cover at the end of
2011 from over 5 months in 2009/10.
The rate of consumer price inflation increased to 7.7 percent in December 2011, but moderated
to 7.4 percent in February 2012. The increase was driven mainly by rising international
commodity prices as well as domestic supply constraints. Moreover, the resurgence in global
food and fuel prices is expected to continue to exert inflationary pressures in 2012.
Medium-term outlook and policies
The medium term outlook remains uncertain due to persistently weak global economic
environment. However, the authorities expect generally robust domestic economic performance
during 2012/13. GDP is expected to maintain strong growth, boosted by the mining and
construction industries. Mining, which is still at its infancy, is set to continue growing, as
existing firms expand operations and new ones enter the market. Additional stimulus for the
construction industry is expected from Phase II of the Lesotho Highlands Water Project.
Meanwhile, a projected recovery in SACU revenue is expected to improve the fiscal and external
positions, although still heavily subject to the external environment.
In line with the National Strategic Development Plan 2012/13 – 2016/17 (NSDP), Lesotho’s
overarching development objective is to accelerate growth, create jobs and reduce poverty. To
this end, the authorities will continue to pursue policies aimed at, among others, promoting
employment-creating and sustainable economic growth; enhancing democratic governance and
effective institutions; and developing key infrastructure to support production. The pursuit of
these policies, which are outlined below, will also be supported by the ECF program.
Fiscal policies
In the medium term, the authorities will pursue fiscal consolidation, limit budget deficits to 3
percent of GDP and maintain public debt at sustainable levels, through various measures.
Recurrent expenditure will be kept constant in real terms while priority will be given to spending
increases associated with productive investment. In addition, the authorities will enhance their
efforts in mobilizing domestic revenue. These measures will also be accompanied by efforts to
eliminate wasteful spending and fraud; and improve accountability and efficiency in the
management of public finances. Furthermore, proposals for capital projects will be subjected to
strict appraisal criteria, to prioritize projects with maximum contribution to economic growth,
employment and poverty reduction. Finally, the authorities will work with staff to define the
appropriate components of the core SACU fiscal balance, which the authorities are proposing to
target with effect from 2012/13. It is expected that these policies will help the authorities to
rebuild international reserves to at least five months of imports and continue to maintain the
exchange rate parity between the loti and the South Africa rand.

2

Monetary and financial sector policies
My authorities remain committed to the fixed exchange rate arrangement between the loti and
the rand, which has over the years anchored price stability in the country. In this regard,
Lesotho’s monetary policy continues to focus on the maintenance of adequate international
reserves to maintain the peg.
On the issue of broader financial sector reforms, the authorities will continue to pursue policy
measures aimed at ensuring the soundness and efficiency of the sector. An important milestone
was the review of the legislative framework and subsequent enactment, by Parliament in 2011, of
the new Financial Institutions Act. Among others, the Act addresses shortcomings in the old
legislation such as illegal deposit-taking (including pyramid schemes), and regulation of nonbank financial institutions and large financial cooperatives. It is also intended to strengthen
corporate governance in the financial sector. These reforms are intended to reinforce other
structural reform measures to promote growth and employment.
Growth, employment and poverty reduction
The NSDP, which was completed with the support of Lesotho’s development partners, identifies
key development objectives and strategies to achieve them. In this framework, the authorities
have, among others, set the objective of creating an enabling environment for the private sector
as an engine of growth and employment creation. They have identified the need for improved
productivity and investment climate as important sources of growth. This improvement will be
achieved through reforms that will facilitate private sector development and economic
diversification, with close cooperation with Lesotho’s development partners. Specifically, some
of the measures that are intended to improve the business environment include the Partial Credit
Guarantee Scheme that was launched in August 2011. This is expected to facilitate greater access
to credit by small and medium enterprises. The review of the Companies Act, also under way, is
aimed at introducing shorter, simpler and more cost effective mechanisms for incorporation and
registration of companies. In the meantime, the Trading Enterprise Regulations have been
amended and were published in December 2011, to shorten the time required to start a business
and introduce some flexibility with regard to business premises. Furthermore, the authorities
intend to submit the Industrial Licensing Bill to Parliament by end-September 2012, which
would streamline the process and enhance transparency in granting manufacturing and industrial
licenses.
Conclusion
In conclusion, my authorities continue to demonstrate firm commitment to implement the ECF
arrangement as reflected in the strong program performance. Their commitment to the
implementation of the policies supported under the program going forward remains unwavering.
My Lesotho authorities consider the Fund’s and other development partners’ policy advice and
financial assistance critical to the successful implementation of their development agenda
towards achieving inclusive growth and attaining the MDGs.
